Subject: Failing drive? S.M.A.R.T. utilities?

From the sounds of it, I've got a failing drive on this machine.  It
sounds like it momentarily loses power, but then spins right back up. 
I've verified that the power and ribbon cables are securely inserted,
and the failures don't seem to be triggered by the occasional bump or
jostle on my desk.  The system logs show:
kernel: hdc: lost interrupt
kernel: hdc: read_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
kernel: hdc: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
kernel: hdc: drive not ready for command
kernel: ide1: reset: success
kernel: hdc: status error: status=0x00 { }
kernel: hdc: drive not ready for command
kernel: hdc: status error: status=0x00 { }
kernel: hdc: drive not ready for command
kernel: hdc: status error: status=0x00 { }
kernel: hdc: drive not ready for command
kernel: hdc: status error: status=0x00 { }
kernel: hdc: drive not ready for command
kernel: ide1: reset: success
The drive in question is:
/dev/hdc:
 Model=Maxtor 87000A8, FwRev=TAVX2821, SerialNo=F8057CDA
 Config={ Fixed }
 RawCHS=14475/15/63, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=20
 BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=256kB, MaxMultSect=16, MultSect=8
 DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=2(fast)
 CurCHS=851/255/63, CurSects=13678880, LBA=yes, LBAsects=13678880
 tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 *mword2 
 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4 
I'm heading now to buy a new drive, but I'm wondering if I've got
something setup incorrectly or if there are known incompatibilities with
this drive on my FIC 503+ board (VIA VP3 chipset).
Also, I notice that /proc/ide/hdc contains a couple files with
S.M.A.R.T. values.  Are there any utilities which will convert this to
usable (for humans) information?  Maybe those contain some clues about
the problem?
