Looks OK - there's no way of stopping the kernel thread anyway.
It appears that nobody has tried to use this driver at the same time as
software-suspend.  At least, not successfully.  A strategic try_to_freeze()

This will become (a little) more serious when cpu hotplug is switched to
use the process freezer, and perhaps it breaks kprobes already.
