How about _very_ long term to remove sysctl (i.e. January 2010)?

+Description:
+	sys_sysctl uses binary paths that have been found to be a major
+	pain to maintain and use.  The interface in /proc/sys is now
+	the primary and what everyone uses.
+	
+	Nothing has been using the binary sysctl interface for some time
+	time now so nothing should break if you disable sysctl syscall
+	support, and you kernel will get marginally smaller.
