Hi,
The problem got solved by replacing the AHA-3944 card to
AIC-7895, thus switching the order of SCSI discovery.
It seems that still a SCSI ordering problem.
Thanks any way!

> Hello,
	Yes, I encountered the same problem, and have a fix, but
	want to test it. If the author of scsi_scan.c would like
	to correct it, then that would be fine.
	Basically the problem is in scan_scsis_single.
	Some scsi devices are notoriously brain dead
	about answering inquiries without having 
	recived a TUR and then spinning up.
	The problem seems to be the disk, not the controller,
	if this is the same problem.
	The problem appeared in the test kernels because
	the TUR *used* to be there, now it is not.
	Hope this helps.
	Just curious, what kind of scsi disk do you have??
	lemme guess... Compaq Atlas?? :>
	cheers, 
	Elizabeth
