You are right. Sort of :)
But 1, we *want* them to be less visible to the kernel developer,
so this is still a plus.
2, delimiting critical sections with the checks (as preempt does)
rigorously defines scheduling latency as the minimum possible (ie.
critical section latency).
3, all of the overhead is removed if you don't care about latency
and thus turn off preempt.

There is no denying that there is a performance penalty with preempt
Actually it has to pay double because the bkl means it can't optimise
cond_resched away entirely (would be nice to kill the bkl one day).
But I think that the impact is small enough so that nobody who wants
sub-ms latency will care.
