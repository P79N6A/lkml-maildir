Hi,
This is the "new and improved" version of the patch  
that was sent out earlier this week. Thanks for all the 
feedback/suggestions.
(lkml subject line reference for previous thread -
"Dynamic cpufreq governor and updates to ACPI P-state driver")
The changes from the previous version:
1) dynamic cpufreq governor changes completely separated 
  from the updates to acpi P-state driver. These patches only 
  deal with dynamic cpufreq governor. Separate patch will be 
  sent out later to cover acpi updates.
2) New name for this cpufreq driver "cpufreq_ondemand"
  (Thanks to Pavel for the name)
3) Miscellaneous bugfixes and changes based on the review comments
4) And introduction of tuning knobs, where advanced user can tune
  the cpufreq_ondemand behaviour. 
  (Thanks to Dominik for helping me with this)
  Sampling_rate, down_threshold, up_threshold are currently exported.
  More advanced user who wants to change the algorithm itself, can 
  take the base infrastructure from this driver and come up with a 
  new/optimized frequency switching algorithm, as this driver is GPLed
:).
Patch contents (patches against 2.6.0-test8):
ondemand1.patch - 'unit' related bugfixes in drivers. 
ondemand2.patch - basic cpufreq_ondemand governor, with some changes 
since the last time.
ondemand3.patch - Adding sysfs interface for cpufreq_ondemand 
tunables and making sysfs access by cpufreq governors safe against 
removal of the underlying module (from Dominik). 
Thanks,
-Venkatesh
