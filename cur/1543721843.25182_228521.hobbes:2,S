the problem with this is that you can have the situation where it's a SuSE 
box with a kernel.org kernel. I've had significant problems with 
installers for 3rd party software that decided what distro they were 
running on based on what kernel version showed up in uname
by the way there's useually a *version file in /etc that tells you what 
version of a particular distro you are running on (or at least what it was 
before it got tweaked)
