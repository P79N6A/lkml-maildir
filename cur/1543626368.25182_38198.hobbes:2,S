What? 'since amount of RAM' has nothing to do with AGP aperature. The
aperature should be the same as the amount of AGP shared RAM used for
the screen-card on-board graphics. This is normally set by the BIOS but
can be reset if the BIOS doesn't 'understand' your screen card.
So, unless you have 256 MB on your screen board, typically 32 MB for
high-resolution true-color boards, you will be disabling PCI hardware
hand-shaking for a lot of addresses above your screen board. This
can make DRAM-controler, controlled RAM accesses interfere.
