I think that nearly all private logging functions
could be eliminated by having a new macro defined
especially for logging.
Something akin to:
#define PRINTK_MODNAME  1
#define PRINTK_FILE     2
#define PRINTK_FUNCTION 4
#define PRINTK_LINE     8
#define PRINTK_PREFIX (your choice)
#include <linux/logging.h>
then all uses of pr_<level> could get modified for free.
