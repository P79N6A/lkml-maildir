Yes, you are absolutely correct, I don't need the (gsi<16) part, this
takes care of PCI IRQs that happened to be <16.

The only problem is here:
+	if (i < NR_IRQS) {
+		gsi_2_irq[gsi] = i;
+		printk(KERN_INFO "GSI %d sharing vector 0x%02X and IRQ
%d\n",
+				gsi, vector, i);
+		return i;
+	}
+
+	i = next_irq++;
 
That means for any IRQ < NR_IRQS you allow it to be identity mapped,
with all the gaps, and only for ones exceeding 224 you'll assign
consecutive next_irqs++, whereas you can do it for all PCI IRQs above
15. So, the alternative clause should probably come down to just:
                 irq = next_irq++;
                 gsi_2_irq[gsi] = irq; - which means just removing the
one above...
(although we better test that :)...I will definitely test vector sharing
when manage to get on max configuration partition here.
