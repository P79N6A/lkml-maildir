The only thing that worries me in theory about your approach for this
Andrea is fragmentation - if we try to shrink only when we're low on
memory, isn't there a danger that one buffer_head per page of slab
cache will be in use, and thus no pages are freeable (obviously this
is extreme, but I can certainly see a situation with lots of partially used
pages)? 
With Andrew's approach, keeping things freed as we go, we should
reuse the partially allocated slab pages, which would seem (to me)
to result in less fragmentation?
Thanks,
M.
