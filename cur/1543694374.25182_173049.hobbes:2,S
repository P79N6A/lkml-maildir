Neat.

FWIW archival storage doesn't really care...  Since all data written to 
disk is hashed with SHA1 (sha1 hash == block's unique id), you gain (a) 
duplicate block coalescing and (b) _real_ data integrity guaranteed, but 
OTOH, you lose performance and possibly lose zero-copy.
I _really_ like the checksum aspect of Plan9's archival storage (venti).
As Andre H and Larry McVoy love to point out, data isn't _really_ secure 
until it's been checksummed, and that checksum data is verified on 
reads.  LM has an anecdote (doesn't he always?  <g>) about how BitKeeper 
-- which checksums its data inside the app -- has found data-corrupting 
kernel bugs, in days long past.
