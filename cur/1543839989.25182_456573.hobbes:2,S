There's no reason I can see that kqueue's kevent should not be able to
check an mmaped buffer as in your implementation, after having passed
any filter changes to the kernel.
I'm not sure if I read you correctly, but the situation where all
events are ready immediately is not a problem. Only the delta is
passed with the kevent call, so old events will still be first in the
queue. And as long as the user doesn't randomize the order of the
changelist and passes the changedlist with each kevent call, the
resulting order in which changes are received will be no different
from using individual system calls.
If there's some very specific reason the user needs to retain the
order in which events happen in the interval between adding it to the
changelist and calling kevent, he may decide to call kevent
immediately without asking for any events.

The question I'm asking is not whet ever kqueue can fit this
implementation, but rather if it is possible to make the
implementation fit kqueue. I can't really see any fundemental
differences, merely implementation details. Maybe I'm just unfamiliar
with the requirements.

Are you referring to udata or data? I'll assume the latter as the
former is more of a restriction on user-space. intptr_t is required to
be safely convertible to a void*, so I don't see what the problem
would be.

I must have missed that discussion. Please enlighten me in what regard
using an opaque type with lower resolution is preferable to a type
defined in POSIX for this sort of purpose. Considering the extra code
I need to write to properly handle having just ms resolution, it
better be something fundamentally broken. ;)
