Runtime tricks that increase complexity cost, yes.  It's all a question 
of measured gain vs. complexity.  But a couple of percent gained on an 
overall basis can be magnified enormously if you are looking at a 
workload that stresses a particular path.  I would expect some of those 
gains to be non-trivial, especially if considering the optimizations you 
could do on page table updates knowing you needn't worry about SMP 
issues anymore.  Even UP has (still?) some places where additional locks 
are present here, and could benefit from having SMP alternatives.
