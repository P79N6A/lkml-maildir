No, as of today, kexec does not relocate vmlinux. At compilation time,
vmlinux is compiled for a fixed address and vmlinux is loaded at that
address. This compile address can be controlled with CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START,
as you already mentioned in your patchset.
So in the case of kdump, if one wishes to use vmlinux instead of a relocatable
bzImage, he will re-compile the kernel for a different address and then use
that vmlinux.
OTOH, boot loader can possibly relocate vmlinux because all the relocation
information is retained in vmlinux (Using ld option --emit-relocs). But
probably self relocating image should be a better option as all the
boot-loaders out there don't have to be modifed.

My guess is that PT_LOAD16 is not an acceptable value. Putting information
in PT_NOTE seems interesting (As Eric already mentioned).

I think there will have to be an upper limit on the address where you can
relocate your image to. Anyway, given i386 virtual memory address space
constraint, I think you can not load kernel image in high memory (896MB).
It has to run anywhere below that.
I think you are referring to defining absolute symbols. Already there are
some absolute symbols generated when kernel is compiled and these are
not relocated while image is being loaded at a non-compiled address. So if
a boot loader decides to relocate a vmlinux image, it will have to skip
relocations present w.r.t absolute symbols. (Unfortunately, ld does generate
relocation entries even for absolute symbols).

In a nutshell, Yes.

We already do checksum verification to make sure newly loaded kernel has
not been corrupted before we jump to it. What's the point in doing the
verification existing kernel text. Because even that is intact, and you
reload your data section, that data section will have to be reloaded at
the same place where previous data section was. Now after you re-loaded 
the data section, some DMA might corrupt it now (Because we never stopped
DMAs). So loading a fresh copy of text and data section at a reserved 
memory location seems safer.

As a user you can very well do it. Distros are also doing something 
similar. They just insert 1-2 modules from initrd (custom initrd created
based on choice of dump saving destination) and capture the dump either
to a local storage or over network and then system is booted back to
production kernel.

Interesting question, How does a boot loader/user decide where to load
the relocatable image? I think it depends on the new interesting usages
of the relocatable kernel. As of today, kexec knows where is reserved
memory region (Read from /proc/iomem) and it loads the image at the
start of that reserved region (Meeting alignment restrictions, if any). So
in this case boot loader takes the decision. May be a user option also
can be created, something like --load-address=0xXYZ and then people
can have fun loading same image at various addresses.
I think this is interesting usage if boot loader can somehow decide
that first few MB is faulty and load kernel at a memory address higher
than that. If first whole 1G is faulty then you can't do much on i386,
but on 64bit arches like x86_64, this should not be an issue.
