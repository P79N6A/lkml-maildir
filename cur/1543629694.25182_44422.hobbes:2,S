When I boot 2.5.13 it hangs at startup with endless
    hda: lost interrupt
It seems to happen at the moment it wants to activate swap. At least,
that's what I see when I boot 2.5.7 and compare the boot messages.
(Note that I have to write those messages down, because nothing can be
logged on disk at that point.)
I am clueless what to do next.
