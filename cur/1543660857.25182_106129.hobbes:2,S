I don't usually compile support for modules in at all, and even on
486s the boot time isn't *that' long.  30 Seconds or so on a 4 Mb RAM,
486 SX 20 for a complete boot, only about half than until init starts.
I personally don't think a few seconds of text mode is a major
problem.
What I'm wondering is how long it will be before text mode is no
longer implemented in VGA cards at all.  Once the BIOS stops using it,
who needs it anymore?
