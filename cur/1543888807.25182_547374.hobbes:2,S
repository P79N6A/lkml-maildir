Yeah, I've got that data... just a sec while I make sure it's 
reproducable...
Aha, I hadn't decoded the devfn before, looks like it's dying on an access 
to the graphics device (bus 0, slot 2, device 0):
...
pci_mmcfg_read: 0, 0, 0x10, 0x18, 4 = 0xc000000c
pci_mmcfg_read: 0, 0, 0x10, 0x18, 4 = <hang>
...
Offset 0x18 into the graphics config space should be the graphics memory 
range address, and 0xc000000c is the correct value.  But for some reason 
it hangs on the second access.
It hangs here everytime.
