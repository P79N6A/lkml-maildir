i havent seen your latest code - what is the basic data-structure? The
stock kernel has arrays of timers with increasing granularity and a
cascade mechanism to move timers down the arrays as they slowly expire -
but with a high-resolution API (1 usec accuracy?) how does the basic
data structure look like?
Is the "noise" due to timers expiring "at once" - but isnt it unlikely
for 'normal' timers to expire in exactly the same usec as the real
high-resolution one?
or is it that we have a 'group' of normal timers expiring, which, if
they happen to occur _just_ prior a HRT event will generate a larger
delay?
