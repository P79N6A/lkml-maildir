find below the fix that puts yielding tasks to the rightmost position in 
the rbtree. I have not tested it extensively yet, but it appears to work 
on x86. (i tested yield using interactive tasks and they get hurt now 
under load - but this would be expected.)

Subject: sched: make yield more agressive
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
make sys_sched_yield() more agressive, by moving the yielding task
to the last position in the rbtree.
