Imo, that's still a crime against common sense.  Madvice should give
the kernel some advice about which data to keep or not to keep in
memory, hence the name.  It should *not* tell the kernel to corrupt
data, which currently appears to be the case.
If the application knows 100% that it is the _only_ possible user of
this data and will never again use it, dropping dirty pages might be a
sane option.  Effectively that translates to anonymous memory only.
In all other cases, dirty pages should be written back.

Definitely.
