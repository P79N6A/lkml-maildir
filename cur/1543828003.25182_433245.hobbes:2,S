Yes, please submit a follow-on for the indentation.

Please note that we have several pci ids: 
         {PCI_VENDOR_ID_COMPAQ, PCI_DEVICE_ID_COMPAQ_CISS[ABCD],
          0x0E11, 0x4070, 0, 0, 0},
The pci id identifies the controller family such as 53xx, 64xx, etc. We
use the subsystem pci id to identify the particular controller like 641,
642, etc.
I had added this to the driver we release on hp.com:
       { PCI_VENDOR_ID_HP, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID,
                PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_RAID << 8, 0xffff << 8, 0},
to bind to Smart Array controllers for which I don't have an id. Seems
to work okay but then I need another method for displaying product name,
etc. There are also additional fields in the products struct on which we
rely. Things like number of s/g's and number of outstanding commands,
for instance. These are supposed to be in the firmware's config table
but we find they lie to us most of the time. :)
Lots of words, not much meaning.
