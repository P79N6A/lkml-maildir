Minor git administrative note...  In my trees, the 'master' branch is 
always vanilla Linus, and I never ever apply my own changes to it.  This 
enables commands such as
	git diff master..upstream > patch
	git log master..upstream > log.txt
	git log master..upstream | git shortlog > shortlog.txt
to work as expected.
Typically I do not update 'master' unless I am also updating 'upstream' 
with vanilla Linus changes, in order to avoid screwing up the tree heads 
and the diff.  When I do update 'master' from 'upstream', it is a 
trivial matter to then pull those changes into 'upstream':
	git checkout -f upstream
	git pull . master
