ok ok. The real work that needs to be done is in sunrpc and I'm still
*very* far from providing any patches.
This kernel thread is a sub thread of the lockd thread. It's a bit more
simple and does not require as much modification. It still depends on the
way its parent is killed and it will require some more work when the sunrpc
thread are fixed.

The SIGKILL used to terminate the threads is a challenge ... it propagates
to sub threads. Some other stuff that bother me in using the kthread api in
sunrpc : nfs_callback_down() uses a wait on a completion with a timeout.
This is not possible with the kthread but might not be really useful. dunno.
We might need some enhancements to kthread to make everyone happy or some
work around in the model.

They would certainly do a better job than me. I'm discovering the code.
Thanks,
