To use it, you've to call it like
	MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
The string (license name) you supply is stored into the module binary
and checked ad module load time. Either it's "GPL" (or a few others
IIRC) or it isn't. If it is, the module is GPL and (after you've shipped
the module) any user can legally ask for sources (and you've to ship
them). If it isn't GPL (or the other accepted variants), it'll taint the
kernel. That'll tell us to not look at oopses, though...
