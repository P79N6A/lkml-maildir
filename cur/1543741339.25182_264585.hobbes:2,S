I tried patching vmlinux.lds.S using the above patch and it failed.
Looking at the file shows the LOCK_TEXT line is already in the file.
After reading the dialog between Remi Colinet and Vivek Goyal regarding
the same problem, my next step is to update the binutils to the latest
version. AHA! It looks as though RHEL 3.3 WS up2date downreved binutils
to 2.14.90.0.4 and the latest GNU version is 2.15 so reinstalling it is
in order, which has fixed the build problem. Next step, adventures in
booting B-|
