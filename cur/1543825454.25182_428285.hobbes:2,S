I forgot to mention - the kernels with this patch and the config
option enabled cannot be compiled with gcc4 because of a compiler bug
that always returns "true" for __builtin_constant_p(), even if its
argument can only be determined at run-time. This causes a few
compilation errors on the container_of usage.
