Here's a series of twelve patches to introduce down_killable().  I expect
the first ten to be uncontroversial, and easy to apply.  The last two
... I'm still testing.  More testers would be welcome, particularly
people who have performance test-suites they wouldn't want to see regress.
The way I go about introducing down_killable is to replace all the
carefully hand-tuned assembler with a generic C implementation.  One of
the annoying things about this is that the header file is in
asm/semaphore.h instead of linux/semaphore.h.  I tackle this by removing
all the obsolete inclusions of asm/semaphore.h (around 100 of them).
In order for that to work, I actually need to add a couple in places
where they were being implicitly included.
Then I replace the per-arch implementations with a generic one.  All the
<asm/semaphore.h> files become a one-line include of linux/sempahore.h.
Then all remaining users in the tree are converted to use
linux/semaphore.h.
I add 'removal of asm/semaphore.h' to features-removal to not inflict
extra pain on Andrew during this process.
So, to recap:
Patches 1 -  2: Add missing includes
Patches 3 - 10: Remove obsolete includes (split up by top-level directory)
Patch       11: Generic semaphore implementation
Patch       12: Switch remaining users to linux/semaphore.h
I hope this split causes the least amount of pain.
