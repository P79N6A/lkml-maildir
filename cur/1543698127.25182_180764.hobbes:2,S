Well, it works as it should -I guess-,ie. swsusp proceeds, but (as 
expected) after all it doesn't work with scsi and swsusp gives a kernel 
panic. But that is another matter. ;-)
Nevertheless I got following wanrings on compile (second one was already 
there):
drivers/scsi/libata-core.c: In function `ata_thread':
drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:2571: Warnung: implicit declaration of 
function `refrigerator'
drivers/scsi/libata-core.c: At top level:
drivers/scsi/libata-core.c:2141: Warnung: `ata_qc_push' defined but not used
(Furthermore the patch didn't want to apply, so I had to do it by hand.)
Thx,
Prakash
