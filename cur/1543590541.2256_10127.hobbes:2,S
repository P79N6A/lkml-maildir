Hum, not _only_. 
Initially I thought about __GFP_FAIL to be used by writeout routines which
want to cluster pages until they can allocate memory without causing any
pressure to the system. Something like this: 
while ((page = alloc_page(GFP_FAIL))
	add_page_to_cluster(page);
write_cluster(); 
See?

This obviously depends on what we decide __GFP_FAIL will be used for.
