Just to throw another possibly-overlooked variable into the mess:
My system here is using the on-demand cpufreq policy governor.
I wonder how that interacts with the various schedulers here?
I suppose for the "make" kernel case, after a couple of seconds
the cpufreq would hit max and stay there for the rest of the build,
so it shouldn't really be a factor for (non-)interactivity during the build.
Or should it?
Cheers
