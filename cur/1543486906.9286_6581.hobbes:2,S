Hi,
Win95 can be installed on a server via NETSETUP.EXE. As far as the resource
kit help says, this must be a server capable of NetBIOS over IPX or NetBIOS
over NetBEUI. 
Is the IPX support in the Linux kernel far enough to allow me to do this? Or
is this rather a Samba/marsnwe issue?
Where do I get more info about this? Neither samba, nor marsnwe tell me
anything about this.
Thanks!
