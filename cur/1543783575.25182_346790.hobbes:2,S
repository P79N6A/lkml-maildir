Hi Andrew!
Do you plan to send FUSE to Linus for 2.6.14?
I know you have some doubts about usefulness, etc.  Here are a couple
of facts, that I hope show that Linux should benefit from having FUSE:
 - total number of downloads from SF: ~25000
 - number of downloads of last release (during 3 months): ~7000
 - number of distros carrying official packages: 2 (debian, gentoo)
 - number of publicly available filesystems known: 27
 - of which at least 2 are carried by debian (and maybe others)
 - number of language bindings: 7 (native: C, java, python, perl, C#, sh, TCL)
 - biggest known commercial user: ~110TB exported, total bandwidth: 1.5TB/s
 - mailing list traffic 100-200 messages/month
 - have been in -mm since 2005 january
Miklos
