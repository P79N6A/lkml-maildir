I spent some time, last I think, seriously considering this approach.
The more I thought about the details, the more I realised that it wasn't
a viable approach. As I said before, it does indeed sound like a dream
at first, but once you get into the details, it becomes more and more of
a nightmare.

Perhaps that would be a good idea. Then you'll get to see those issues
too.

I'm not going to bother saying more in response to that at the moment.
It seems clear to me that the three of us who've actually worked on
hibernation and thought about the issues actually know nothing, and
everyone who hasn't worked on it is far more expert than us.
I'm not saying that I think it's utterly impossible to use kexec for
hibernation. I am saying that I think such an implementation would be
even more of a headache than the existing issues.

Nigel
