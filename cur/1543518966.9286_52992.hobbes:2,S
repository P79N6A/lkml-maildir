A CDRW and floptical are very different. The floptical type
devices work just fine with sd and so does the DVD-RAM. The
difference is than on these types of devices you can write
anything you'd like once it has been formatted. In fact for
DVD-RW you can too, since a the device will gather the data
it needs when you write a partial packet itself. That is
not the case for CD-RW.
