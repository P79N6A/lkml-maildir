We've gotten some great benchmarks (I originally asked all the users for
them), I would be happy to send some your way if I can dig them up.
Basically we saw average latency drop to under 5ms; 1ms in many cases. 
Worst-case latency tended to be around 50ms, but we have measured locks
(using the preempt-stats) which are still in the way-to-long range.
I think preemption is a very natural and clean solution the problem --
its the way things should just be, anyhow.
Nonetheless, running a lock-breaking patch on top of preemption is
interesting.  I am looking into doing this with the lock times I have
collected.

With preemption, we can gain the <10ms that most "regular" users want. 
Without it, we don't have it.
With preemption, we can come super close to the 0.5-1ms latency (on
average) the specialized groups list want.  With preemption and perhaps
some other work (something akin to your low-latency patch) we can
achieve it for sure ... perhaps better.
If we can achieve such great results, and keep throughput low, and do it
with such little complexity -- of course, after we prove all this -- why
not merge it?  Anyhow, its a configure option!
