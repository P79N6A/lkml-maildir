That patch applies on top of the previous one from Srivatsa.  Here is
a single patch that has the change we want against Linus' tree.
During some signal test, we found that v_regs pointer was not setup correctly.
v_regs was made to point to itself, as a result of which the pointer was
corrupted when vec registers were copied over. When the signal handler
returned, restore_sigcontext tried derefering the invalid pointer and in
the process killed the app with SIGSEGV.
