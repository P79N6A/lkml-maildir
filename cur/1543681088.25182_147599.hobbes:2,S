I do not forsee there _ever_ being a TOE interface for Linux.
It's not a forbidden discussion, but, the networking developers tend to 
ignore people who mention TOE because it's been discussed to death, and 
no evidence has ever been presented to prove it has advantages where it 
matters, and it has significant _dis_advantages from the get-go.
I really should write an LKML FAQ entry for TOE.
