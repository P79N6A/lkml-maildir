I'd just prefer a 
	<asm-generic/mutex-xchg-algo.h>
and then any architecture can do whatever they damn well want, and 
anybody who doesn't want to, can just include that header file.
No #ifdef's, no config options, no "generic fallback". Just 
unconditionally do the sane thing.
I'm with whoever HATES those stupid __ARCH_xxx #defines. It's a sign of 
bad design. Either it's a generic algorithm (and it can be in 
<asm-generic> or it's not). In no case should we ever have __ARCH_HAS_xxx 
(and yes, that includes cases where we _currently_ use __ARCH_HAS_xxx).
