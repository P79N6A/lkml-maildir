This isn't a kernel issue. My understanding is that this is just the way
xinit works.
xinit attempts to startup the server and then start the clients. There
is a race condition here. If the clients start before the server, they
would die. So, xinit tries right away and if that doesn't work it falls
back to waiting 30 seconds and trying again.
