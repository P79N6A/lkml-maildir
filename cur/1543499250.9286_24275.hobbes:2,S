The same as for mkdir("foo")? mkdir behaves like open( ,O_CREAT|O_EXCL, );
Which doesn't follow links, by exactly the same reasons. Think of
ln -sf <something_interesting_that_should_not_exist> /tmp/foo012345
when root-owned process is expected to create/mkdir/mknod/rename to
/tmp/foo12345.
Just to clarify: mkdir("foo") doesn't follow the link. mkdir("foo/") does.
