S/390 is also affected. And I vaguely recall special issues with sparc
too. That is why I dropped the arch support for that a long time ago from
the patchset. Then there was some talk a couple of months back to use
another addressing mode on IA64 that may also require 128 bit ptes. There
are significantly different ways of doing optimal SMP locking for these
scenarios.
