Jeff, I agree completely that Emulex code is infested with wrappers
so much that it's harmful. However, the particular example you selected
you interpret wrong.

Flag problem on sparc is fixed by Keith Wesolowsky for 2.6.3-rcX,
and it never existed on sparc64, which keeps CWP in a separate register.
Why it took years to resolve is that the expirience showed that
there is no legitimate reason to pass flags as arguments. Every damn
time it was done, the author was being stupid. Keith resolved it
primarily because it was an unorthogonality in sparc implementation.

Yes yes yes. This is the way elx_sli_lock is harmful, not because
of its passing flags.
