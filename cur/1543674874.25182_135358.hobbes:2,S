Ah, my apologies. As for why your buffer usage is so low, it's likely a bit
difficult to tell whether it's indicative of a problem without knowing what
patches have been applied to the Mandrake kernel. Also, I believe the buffers
value these days isn't as useful a metric as it used to be, so personally I
wouldn't worry about it too much, unless you're seeing problems with the box.
