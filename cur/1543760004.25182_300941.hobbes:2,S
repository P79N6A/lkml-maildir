That, plus the fact that inherited capabilities could also be used here,
except they don't work right.  That's a nice, simple and long-standing
kernel feature which I think we should have fixed up before piling in more
security features.

fixed-up-caps to actually put work into it, nothing happens.  And it's a
lot of work, because this is a scary feature.
