Or we could stop that ACPCICA crap ASAP.  The acpi code not only looks
like crap because of that but it's buggy as hell now.
Intel is claiming how great linux is and how supportive is to it, but
can't even write proper code for their abomination of a firmware standard.
This is really more than dishonest.  Please take patches to get acpi into
shape and stop this complaining.
