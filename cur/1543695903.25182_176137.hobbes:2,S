The person who had the problem is actually using the Debian tree which
carried over a patch from 2.4 that removed the truncate_inode_pages
call in set_blocksize.  So I appologise for the noise.
However, may I ask what is preventing us from achieving the goal that
the page cache backed buffer heads can be resized without throwing away
the pages?
In particular, aside from the buffer_error() call, is there any problems
with not throwing the pages away upon a resize?
Cheers,
