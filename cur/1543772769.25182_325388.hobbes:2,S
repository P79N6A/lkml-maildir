Wow...  Did I really offend you so much?
I pretty know who you are, in case you forgot that we know each other, 
and your reading into my words that I somehow might have been suggesting 
that you would do that work yourself is rather amusing.

I read them.  Admitedly some people are quite enthousiastic about 
PREEMPT_RT and maybe a little too anxious to see it appear into 
mainline.  This is however not INgo's case AFAICS.

Thing is that there is just no existing clash.  At least not yet.  The 
whole thing is not ready for merging as Ingo said and therefore any 
discussion on merging issues are rather premature at this point.

Exactly.  How often has it been said on this very list and elsewhere: 
"show me the patch"?  In other words, there is no point discussing any 
merging issues when the project leader himself says it is not ready and 
has not posted any patch labeled as merge candidate.  I somehow trust 
Ingo for posting patches when they are ready to be reviewed for 
integration into mainline +_if_ and _when_ it is time.  Until then loads 
of changes may happen in the PREEMPT_RT code randering any present 
discussion on merging rather moot.
There is no gain into getting too excited about things.
And this sentence is not directed at Karim in particular.
I'm sure the concerned people will recognize themselves.
