Uwe writes alot insulting crap (which is a fact), even if the DVB
subsystem has no maintainer the code should be managed appropriately
and stopping the development is no way to do it.
At the moment we have __tonns of critical bugs__ in the drivers and
the video4linux and dvb framework; both frameworks are incomplete and
don't provide the necessary flexibility to support an infrastructure
for devices which could already be supported at the moment.
We have several (technical) good people which which work on the
framework on different parts but who don't cooperate at all and who
cannot work together at all.
We have alot code which is managed in separated repositories where
different developers spent several years of development (including
reverse engineering, hacking and so on) it's a shame that the whole
project is stuck where it is. New developers who fundamentally want to
change something are not welcome at all, even if they have valuable
ideas.
Some developers are also sick of contributing since the whole
community is flawed at the moment. I propose a few ways to go
* stopping that signed off by madness that every driver developer has
to sign off changes which happened at the core which will definitelly
never happen because people _do not like each other_.
* change the maintainership and push it over to me, even if it sounds
selfish at the moment _every_ code which provides additional features
and where noone expects further improvements within the next few weeks
(without throwing away alot of work or generating useless extra work
by telling someone to rewrite the core of his work); everyone still
can try to write better code - but then he _has to do it completly_
and get in peace with the projects by supporting them to get further.
The problem I have with this project is that many more things are
upcoming at the moment (including bug fixing) but there are certain
developers which first weren't experienced enough, afterwards started
to think about the issues which were tried to discuss at the beginning
already and who don't have an overview about the requirements, neither
do they want to discuss the requirements.
I can name numerous of bugs of this project which can be solved but
which just get ignored. Some known bugs dont even get explained to
people who are interested in fixing them, so this is what I consider
that it's a major problem.
I'm looking for a serious discussion about it, if anyone wants to know
about the history I can point out to many logfiles/older emails which
deeply explain the whole video4linux/dvb issues - the project should
turn back to a real community.
