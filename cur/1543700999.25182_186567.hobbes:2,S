Looking at oss.sgi.com/projects/sn2/sn2-update:
 - no change in 000-hwgfs-update.patch.inprogress, hwgraph_path_lookup
   shall not be reintroduced.
 - 014-cleanup-pci.c.patch:  no change apparently?
 - 030-pciio-cleanup.patch: Dito
 - 071-xswitch.devfunc.patch: Dito.
 - 075-rename-reorg.patch: Dito

Really, that's not what I consider fixing.  Please fix up
000,014 and 030 and drop 071 and 075, then it should be fine for
merging.  071 shouldn't go in at all and 075 needs the renaming killed,
everything else can go in although it's not nice.
