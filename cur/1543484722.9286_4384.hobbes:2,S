> Here my fix rediffed against 2.2.2-pre2:
I am not able to see almost any difference between 2.2.2-pre2 and 2.2.2-pre2
with your patch:
mordor:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
2058    0       0       0       0       0       0
This is after running inode hog. Fine to this point. (However in clean
2.2.2-pre2 the number is bigger, that's fine too as I have some free memory)
Now I am running memory hog that eats all my memory and 99% of swap,
that's what happens with inodes:
mordor:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
2058    1885    0       0       0       0       0
mordor:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
2058    1885    0       0       0       0       0
mordor:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
2058    1883    0       0       0       0       0
mordor:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
2058    1882    0       0       0       0       0
mordor:~# cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-max
2048
(I understand that the difference between inode-max and inode-nr
in this case probably due to more than one inode in a page)
Yes! 1882 inodes goes as "freeable", but they are not shrinked and still
use memory, that otherwise can be used by my programs, that do not need
such a big inode cache this time.
Bye,
    Oleg
