While trying to compile alsa driver I have found there is a small
mistake in the kernel headers. the file irq.h located in
/usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386 tries to include "irq_vectors.h". 
this fails since as I have noticed these machine specific files
have been moved to subdirectories (machine-default, etc.)
I am using a standard PC box.
hope it helps,
Marek
