If the CPU supports SVM this is visible to the user because the SVM
feature flag does not disappear when its disabled. But because with CPUs
having the SVM-lock feature it can be re-enabled in a secure way under
some circumstances the information in /proc/cpuinfo will not be
reliable. Maybe we can check for it in identify_cpu() and print to the
kernel log if its disabled? It will be visible to the user through
dmesg.
