It looks like good idea to me.  Though I still do not see benefits
2.6.x fbcon provides over 2.4.x.
BTW, there is still bad bug with software scrollback and multihead
(it is here since I remember): redraw_screen sets redraw to 0 when 
old_console == new_console, but fbcon uses con_switch() method for 
deciding whether software scrollback should be reinitialized or not.  
As software scrollback is per-system and not per-fbdev thing, this 
has rather nasty consequences - when both fbdevs have different xres, 
console user can crash system (con2fb /dev/fb1 /dev/tty11; set xres 
fb0 != xres fb1; chvt 11; chvt 10; chvt 11; hit alt-shift-pgup 
or force vt11 to scroll; crash, some kernel data structures were
overwritten with 0x0720...).
