S3 works for me with both BIOS F.0F, which I was using before, and F.11, 
which I flashed today after learning it existed.

I would advise trying to compile a custom kernel from scratch with my 
.config first.
I got S3 working first with a very basic kernel config, but I couldn't 
get it to work with my usual kernel. Assuming it was some feature that 
caused the problem, I started disabling features in the hope of getting 
it to work, but I ended up with two different kernels with seemingly 
irrelevant differences, of which one would succesfully resume and one 
wouldn't. So I started added features to the other kernel, and I never 
found out what caused the problem.
I'm not saying that this is not deterministic, but I am saying that, at 
least in my case, it's not obvious what it is that stops S3 from 
working. :-)
Cheers,
Lorenzo
