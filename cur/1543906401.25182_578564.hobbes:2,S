I started having a look at this today. The original patches that I
proposed to clean up the rmtab a few months ago also eliminated this
comma-delimited string. Neil had valid objections to it at the time,
but if we switched to using the IP address as a cache key like Bruce
describes then doing that becomes more reasonable.
The only downside I see is the one Bruce points out -- the size of
the kernel export cache would increase. I don't have a feel for whether
this is a show stopper, however.
Neil, do you have thoughts on what you'd consider a reasonable approach
to fixing this?
