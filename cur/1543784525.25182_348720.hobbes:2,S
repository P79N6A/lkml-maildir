+
+Introduction
+------------
+
+The aic94xx driver supports Adaptec SAS/SATA Host Adapters
+with AIC-94xx chips.  Features include 32/64 bit PCI/PCI-X
+interface supporting up to 66 MHz PCI 2.3 and up to 133 MHz
+PCI-X 2.0 operation.  It supports MSI or PCI interrupt pin.
+      * AIC-9405W is a  4 phy host adapter, 4 port maximum.
+      * AIC-9410W is an 8 phy host adapter, 8 port maximum.
+
+The driver supports Revision B0 or later of the controller.
+
+
+Hot plugging
+------------
+
+Hot plugging is supported, it works and has been tested.
+
+
+Dynamic PCI IDs
+---------------
+
+To make the driver probe and attach to a new device it
+doesn't quite recognize, you can dynamically add to the PCI
+ID table of the driver as follows:
+
+echo "vendor device" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/aic94xx/new_id
+
+For the complete details see Documentation/pci.txt file.
+
+
+Not a HostRAID driver
+---------------------
+
+This driver is _not_ a HostRAID driver, it does _not_
+provide RAID capabilities.  Although RAID could be built on
+top of the devices exported by this driver.
+
+If you would like this driver to attach to a HostRAID
+enabled controller*, set the "attach_HostRAID" module
+parameter to "1" either at module load time or through sysfs.
+
+Kernel command line; append this:
+
+       aic94xx.attach_HostRAID=1
+
+Module loading, append this to your modprobe/insmod:
+
+       attach_HostRAID=1
+
+Or through sysfs, if the driver has already been loaded:
+
+echo "1" > /sys/module/aic94xx/parameters/attach_HostRAID
+
+* This of course could COMPLETELY destroy your HostRAID
+  array, and is NOT recommended.
