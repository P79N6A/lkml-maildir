Agreed ... though limiting usb-storage I/O requests to 64 KB does tend to
mask that difference.  Some network adapters get better throughput than
Windows, too.  URB queueing does the trick ... not really usable on 2.4
kernels, but the costs on 2.6 seem substantially lower than on Windows.

If you're thinking of that net2280 issue, that erratum was specific
to full speed modes, and never appeared at high speed.  Also, that chip
wouldn't be used in mass market IDE adapters.  (Too pricey compared to
the custom chips that have no need for a CPU or PCI.)
But the point is good:  it's easy for hardware to have bugs there.
