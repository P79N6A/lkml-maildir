I don't. That's the "then for the inode data" part.
I'm not claiming that the buffer cache accesses would go away - I'm just
saying that the unbalanced "only buffer cache" case should go away,
because things like "find" and friends will still cause mostly page cache
activity.
(Considering the size of the inode on ext2, I don't know how true this is,
I have to admit. It might still be quite biased towards the buffer cache,
and as such the additional page cache pressure might not be enough to
really cause any major shift in balancing).

Sure.

I have no problem with that. Especially as I suspect the people who use
UFS are more likely to be the technical kind of user who is more inclined
to be able to debug whatever potential problems crop up anyway. Your point
about not duplicating the fragment handling is certainly quite convincing
for the case of UFS.

Let's plan on UFS-only, for all the prudent reasons.
