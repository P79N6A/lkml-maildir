For as long as I can remember, if you removed a directory which is the
current working directory of a process (for example, a shell), and then tried
to do anything with that process that accesses the current working directory
(for example, type "ls"), you'd get a ENOENT.
Under 2.2, though, the opendir(".") succeeds and creates the appearance of an
empty directory. Even stranger, attempts to creat() or mkdir() in the
nonexistent directory yield EPERM.
Is this now the expected behavior, or was there an accident in last-minute
rmdir() changes?
