Hi,
  I am trying to write a linux kernel module.I want to
use sys_sendto,sys_recvfrom etc calls from the
module.However these symbols are not present in
'ksyms'.One sluggish option is to modify socket.c (
which contains these function definitions ) to export
the symbols. However this would require comiling the
entire kernel.Is there a descent way to do this ??
Pls help !!!
Amber
