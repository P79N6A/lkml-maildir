I couldn't find any information whatsoever in that bug report as to what
mount options he is using, or what server export options are in use. No
info either about what networking hardware he is using (or what drivers
are in use).
I'd also recommend using something like ttcp to see if large packets
(NFS read/write packets are typically ~ 32k large) are being transmitted
efficiently.
