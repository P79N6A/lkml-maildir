Well, even if the NFS server is generating bad cookies (and that may
be possible), the NFS client should be more robust and not spin in a
loop forever.
Can you send me a directory list (from the server) of the directory in
question?  Also, can you send me the output of dumpe2fs -h on the
filesystem.  I'll need the later to get the seed for the htree hash,
so I can try replicating this on my end.
Also, have you tried running e2fsck on filesystem on the server?  It
would be very interesting to confirm whether or not the filesystem is
consistent.
