Subject: now that NFS V3 is in 2.2.18pre, could we *please* add the ide-patch

I know it crashes some via chipsets when autotuning (IIRC), but 
if it were added behind CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL it couldn't do any
harm, could it?
I stuck between HPT370 support in 2.4.x but non-working isdn lzs
compression code and the reverse in 2.2.x. Just now I adapted Andre's
2.2.18-3 patch to 2.2.18pre15, and while it was only 30 minutes work,
I'm not clear on why that is necessary.
Greetings,
Jurriaan
