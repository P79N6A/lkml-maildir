Wrong again. You really are quite amusing. The test is "derivative works"
not linking. Linking is a meaningless (in law) computing term with no
place. Legal precedent for combining of works is drawn from things like
shipping a book and a commentary on the book together, putting music to
films, putting photos in a book. These are not "linking"
And I know what the lawyers I've talked to have said about the case of
shipping proprietary modules with the OS. Its a pretty definite "bad idea"
