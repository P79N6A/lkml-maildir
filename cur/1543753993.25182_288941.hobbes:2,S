Greg,
Are I2C algorithm IDs supposed to be unique?  Do they have any meaning in
reality at all?  If the answer is yes to either of these questions, the
following should probably be resolved:
#define I2C_ALGO_PCA    0x150000        /* PCA 9564 style adapters      */
#define I2C_ALGO_SIBYTE 0x150000        /* Broadcom SiByte SOCs         */
