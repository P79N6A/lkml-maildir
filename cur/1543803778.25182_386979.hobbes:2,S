Patch applied, after hand-editing.
Please be aware that your email is copied via scripts directly into the 
kernel changelog.  As such,
* stuff like "hello," "thanks, jason gaston" must be hand-edited out.
* your subject line notes the kernel against which you generated the 
patch.  the sentence "This patch was built against the 2.6.15 kernel." 
had to be hand-edited out.
* "If acceptable, please apply." had to be hand-edited out.
