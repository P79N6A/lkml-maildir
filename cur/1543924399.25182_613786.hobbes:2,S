Subject: [PATCH 1/2] slub: fix leakage

Slub has been quite leaky under load.  Taking mm_struct as an example, in
a loop of swapping kernel builds, after the first iteration slabinfo shows:
Name        Objects Objsize    Space Slabs/Part/Cpu  O/S O %Fr %Ef Flg
mm_struct        55     840    73.7K         18/7/4    4 0  38  62 A
but Objects and Partials steadily creep up - after the 340th iteration:
mm_struct       110     840   188.4K        46/36/4    4 0  78  49 A
The culprit turns out to be __slab_alloc(), where it copes with the race
that another task has assigned the cpu slab while we were allocating one.
Don't rush off to load_freelist there: that assumes c->freelist is empty,
and will lose all of its free slots when c->page->freelist is not empty.
Instead just do a local allocation from c->freelist when it has one.
Which fixes the leakage: Objects and Partials then remain stable.

I recommend this for 2.6.24-rc2 and 2.6.23-stable.
