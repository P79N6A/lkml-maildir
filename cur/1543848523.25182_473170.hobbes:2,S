SuSE (for one?) doesn't appear to know about it. gcc version 4.1.2
20060920 (month old prerelease) still has the problem.  After some
rummaging around, I found the fix (attached in case someone else wants
to try it).
2.6.19-rc1 + patch-2.6.19-rc1-kmemleak-0.11 compiles fine now (unless
CONFIG_DEBUG_KEEP_INIT is set), boots and runs too.. but axle grease
runs a lot faster ;-)  I'll try a stripped down config sometime.

	* tree.h: Declare folding_initializer.
	* builtins.c (fold_builtin_constant_p): Give definite answer
	if folding inside an initializer.
	* fold-const.c: Define folding_initializer.
	(START_FOLD_INIT): Save and then set folding_initializer.
	(END_FOLD_INIT): Restore folding_initializer.
	* gcc.c-torture/compile/builtin_constant_p.c: New test.
