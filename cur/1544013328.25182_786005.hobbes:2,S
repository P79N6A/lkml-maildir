This actually allows the broken config INFINIBAND=m and NET_9P_RDMA=y.
I think the answer is to add INFINIBAND_ADDR_TRANS but leave INFINIBAND
too.  The SUNRPC_XPRT_RDMA patch would have the same problem, but since
SUNRPC_XPRT_RDMA is a hidden option (with help text ?!) that gets set
automatically, there's no way to create the problem config.
