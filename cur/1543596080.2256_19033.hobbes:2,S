Not answering your question, but you might want to try:
Download the source-RPM for the 'fast' kernel, and also the virgin
version of the same kernel, and then diff them to see what changes
have been made.
If you are lucky, the RPM itself my have the virgin data and diffs, I
don't know much about RPMS, but I'm pretty sure this is possible.
You are looking for changes outside of linux/drivers/, probably in
linux/archo/i386 or linux/kernel. Hopefully there aren't too many of
these.
Also, you want the .config file that was used, try using that against
a virgin kernel first, and see if that changes anything, if not, then
do diff the above (diff -Nur virgin-kernel/ redhat-kernel/) and see
what falls out.
