	Yep. I understand. Is it possible some extra checks/locks
to ensure that we don't modify already closed file? I know that some
locking is needed and I need your help if this idea will be
accepted.

	the code
	sk->state_change(sk);
	sock_wake_async(sk->socket, 1, POLL_HUP);
	looks very similar to this code
	sk->data_ready(sk,0);
	except that the optional event is POLL_IN instead of
POLL_HUP and sock_wake_async is not guarded by callback_lock,
here in tcp_fin(). I assume the lock is not required in this
context. May be I'm wrong, I compare sock_def_wakeup() and
sock_def_readable(). But if we don't use POLL_HUP as an
end marker this change must be removed.

	Sorry, I propose it for testing and not as a patch
ready for the mainstream kernel. I looked in it but I thought
that these parts will be corrected later. // just notes the
change which can be restored.

	My error in sock_release is obvious. The locks must be
removed. My tests worked without locks but I added them later.
sock->sk is always NULL after sock->ops->release(sock).

	To be honest, I don't know it. But my SIGRTMIN is blocked
and I dequeue the events using sigwaitinfo(). I noted that the
signal from close() can be removed and the application can use
FASYNC=off when the end marker is needed to follow the unexpected
events. In this case we don't lose anything.

	The semantic is not changed for poll() but is different
from the rt events (si_code). But I agree if the new POLL_xxx is
added (in include/asm/siginfo.h) not to change the POLL_HUP
semantic. We just need a POLL_xxx for an end marker. These
POLL_xxx codes (include/asm/siginfo.h) are different from POLLxxx
which are defined in include/asm/poll.h. There is a table
"band_table" that converts POLL_xxx to POLLxxx in fs/fcntl.c.
I rely on it when changing the POLL_HUP semantic.

	OK, the POLL_IN event generated from accept*() can
save one syscall. What about the inheritance of some flags?
The current inheritance is a minimum. Some people proposed
more flags to be inherited. They can be added in
check_accept_flags. Or one combo syscall can do the job.

	Yep. It looks ugly. May be the file counters must be
checked. I just followed the current handling of closing
the file descriptors without checking  sure

	I agree to remove the event from close() if FASYNC=off
sends the end marker. Yes, if we provide end marker for all
async file descriptors, this is a more complex task. All
protocols must be corrected. So, I prefer close() not to
send the end marker because this can lead to unconditional
notifications from each close (if put in the VFS layers) which
can cost extra syscalls to dequeue these events when they
are not always needed.
	I saved 4 syscalls (3 fcntl + 1 read) and I use two
extra syscalls to read the end marker using sigwaitinfo (if
send from FASYNC=off). But this is another issue. If the event
is removed from close() and the end marker is not used (via
FASYNC=off) we don't receive more events than before. The
end marker is optional and can be generated from the
application when needed. Normally, we don't use FASYNC=off
but this is the point where the events are stopped and we
can safely send the last event.

	I don't receive rt events for AF_UNIX sockets. I have to
check it again.

	Thank you for your very fast response! I know that
this patch is not ready nor fully functional but it contains
the basics. It can be tuned. I'll remove the event from
close(). With this patch I just want to show an example
for some of the ideas. I can't solve this complex task alone
and I expect that more people will be interested.
