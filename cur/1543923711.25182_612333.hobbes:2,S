Subject: [PATCH] mmap: restore -ENODEV on missing f_op->mmap
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/30/482

 Commit 80c5606c3b45e0176c32d3108ade1e1cb0b954f3 from Linus moved the
 VM_MAYEXEC code further down, but in the process broke the mmap_23_1
 test from the LTP suite. 
 Moving it down means that the test for FMODE_READ ends up above
 the test for f_op->mmap. If the write side of the pipe is called for
 mmap(), we end up returning -EACCES rather than -ENODEV. Was this
 an intended change of behavior? Unless there's a global error precedence
 in SuS that I missed, I think both error codes could be valid here,
 but it is a difference in behavior. Do any spec gurus know for certain?
 Personally, I think this is probably a case of LTP codifying existing
 behavior rather than testing the for the specification. If that's the case
 and nobody really cares about the change in behavior, I'm fine letting this
 drop.
