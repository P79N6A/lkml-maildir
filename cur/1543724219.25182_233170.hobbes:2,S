Yes indeed.  I had the eepro100 in there initially and after it started 
dropping out, I figured I'd see if an 8139too would (I know it sounds 
odd. . .) work better.

I'm back in 2.6.5 now.  Any other tests I can perform to help eliminate 
the potential for a hardware problem?  The timing of the failure is so 
irregular that it would seem to point to a hardware flaw, but who knows.
I can no longer recall when this first started happening, but there's a 
good chance this happened when I was running 2.6.5 too.  I track the 
vanilla releases pretty closely.
Thanks,
Chris
