ide_config_drive_speed() does the following things:
1. disables host DMA
2. sends SET FEATURES command (in polling mode)
3. re-enables host DMA (only if DMA mode was set)
4. updates drive->id->dma_{ultra,mword,1word}
5. updates drive->{current,init}_speed
1. and 2. should really go to higher layers
3. obviously shouldn't be done for itdev->smart
4. also shouldn't be done for itdev>smart
   (we are not changing speed mode)
5. should be done once outside of it821x_tune_chipset()
Therefore current TODO looks like:
* moving DMA fiddling code out of ide_config_drive_speed()
* setting drive->{current,init} speed in it821x_fixups()
* fixing it821x not to call ide_config_drive_speed() for itdev->smart
Fixing user space generated requests requires more work
(i.e. adding ->set_mode method)...
I'll try to cook up some patches later unless somebody beats me to it.
Thanks,
Bart
