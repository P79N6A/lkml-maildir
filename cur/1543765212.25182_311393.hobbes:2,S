Subject: [patch 005/198] arm: add comment about dma_supported()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Russell King <rmk+lkml@arm.linux.org.uk>
The ARM dma_supported() is rather basic, and I don't think it takes into
account everything that it should do (eg, whether the mask agrees with what
we'd return for GFP_DMA allocations).  Note this.
