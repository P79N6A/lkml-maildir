We've tracked this down to a problem where the nodeid might be invalid. Kamalesh
is investigating problem. We suspect we are doing a kmalloc_node with an invalid
nodeid.
We see
cpu with no node 2, num_online_nodes 1
cpu with no node 3, num_online_nodes 1
in the bootlog. Kamalesh verified that the problem exists with both slub and slab.
