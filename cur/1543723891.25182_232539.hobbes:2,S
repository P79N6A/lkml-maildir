Well, then it's not a true no-op.  The other no-ops are all for
init-type stuff, so they're not at all performance critical.  Even
when compiling a non-generic kernel, those no-op functions will be
called.  This is really a limitation in the current machvec-scheme.  I
think what we need is a way to explicitly declare a no-op callback,
such that it can be optimized away completely for platforms that don't
need it.  Perhaps there could be something along the lines of:
#ifdef CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC
# define machvec_noop(noop_function)	noop_function
#else
# define machvec_noop(noop_function)	/* empty */
#endif
Then you could do:
# define platform_tlb_migrate_finish machvec_noop(machvec_mm_noop)
I _think_ this should work, provided that callbacks that expand into
true no-ops never have their address taken.
(This reminds me: in the no-op dummy routines in machvec.c should be
 named based on the type-signature they use, since it's possible to
 share no-op handlers for callbacks with the same type-signature; this
 is why I called the no-op machvec_mm_noop in the example above rather
 than machvec_tlb_migrate_finish as was the case in your patch).
