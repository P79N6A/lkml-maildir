Subject: [PATCH] device-mapper: Record & restore bio state.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/8/96

Simple functions to record and restore bio state so we can
resubmit a bio that returned an error.
DM multipath (following shortly) uses this.
This patch has it private to device-mapper: is it any use elsewhere?
