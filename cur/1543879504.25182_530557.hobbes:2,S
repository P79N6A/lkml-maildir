I'm not in love with the current or other schedulers, so I'm indifferent
to this change. However, I was reviewing your release notes and the
patch and found myself wonder what the logarithmic complexity of this
new scheduler is .. I assumed it would also be constant time , but the
__enqueue_task_fair doesn't appear to be constant time (rbtree insert
complexity).. Maybe that's not a critical path , but I thought I would
at least comment on it.
