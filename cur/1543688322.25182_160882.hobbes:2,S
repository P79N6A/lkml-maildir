Uhh, I tried 2.4.22pre8 a while ago (I think it was Herbert Pötzl's
suggestion), and it locked up too. Shame that the fix didn't make it in
it...
I'll give .22-final a spin.

This is UP box and the kernel is _not_ compiled with CONFIG_SMP.

In my case, the lock up seems clearly related to disk io: it usually happens
during the nightly oracle backup dump, and at some point it kept happening
while compiling kernel. (It's random, I can no longer reproduce it by just
compiling a kernel.)
Do you still think it could be the same one?

What's really strange is that the box kept running with 2.4.20pre7 for
almost a year without problems (with the same oracle dump jub in nightly
cron), and then suddenly begun acting up on my the first day of my summer
vacation...
