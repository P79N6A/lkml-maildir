AFTER you take care of getting some adequate cooling in the peecee case
(heat sink w/thermal compound, ball-bearing CPU fan, case fan OTHER than
the puny throwaway in the power supply, etc.), look up a nifty utility
called 'set6x86' and pay particular attention to how you set
suspend-on-halt to drastically reduce the power consumption of your
Cyrix.  For me, set6x86 made the difference between having a useful
machine, and getting signal 11's everytime I tried to compile the kernel.
Yeah, I'll be trying something besides Cyrix the next time around unless
they are designing their newer CPUs with a bit more margin in the heat
dissipation department.  I'd hate to think what kind of problems I would
be having with a "normal" Cyrix CPU: mine is a 6x86L, as in "low power".
On the plus side, my machine has been stable for well over a year after
taking all the measures described above.  Bottom line: the Cyrix will
work fine for you, but you absolutely HAVE to pay attention to the heat
issue or it will eat your lunch.  I can envision environments where a
Peltier cooler would be necessary...  A year ago when I was seriously
looking into such things, they could be had for around US $30.
