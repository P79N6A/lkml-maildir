We trust hardware, anyway. Like your disk *could* accidentaly turn on
setuid bit on /bin/bash, and we do not insist on userspace
disk-validator.
I do not think paranoia about random generators is neccessary. If
vendor provides you with random generator, it should be ok to just use
it. [Did anyone see failing hw random generator, *at all*?] I can
provide you with plenty of failing hdds....
