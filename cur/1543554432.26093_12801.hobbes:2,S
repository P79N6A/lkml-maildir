[This is quite a bizarre discussion, but I'll answer anyways. I am not exactly
sure what your point is]

boot/compressed/head.S does run in 32bit legacy mode, where you of course
need segment registers. After you got into long mode segments are only
needed to jump between 32/64bit code segments and and for a the data segment
of the 32bit emulation (+ the iretd bug currently which I hope will be fixed
in final hardware) 
Also note that boot/compressed/* currently does not even link, because the 
x86-64 toolchain cannot generate relocated 32bit code ATM (the linker chokes
on the 32bit relocations) The tests we did so far used a precompiled 
relocated binary compressed/{head,misc}.o from a IA32 build.

They are not, you to fully use them you need privileged MSRs. 
Their limit is ignored.

I see no advantage in doing it there instead of in head.S
