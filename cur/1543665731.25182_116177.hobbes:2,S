This is not correct. Well known example:
#include <math.h>
double hypot(double x, double y) {
    return sqrt((x * x) + (y * y));
}
This subroutine hides nothing. It receives input parameters
and returns the result of its operations. Such a subroutine
is properly implemented and should not be be forced to hide
anything.
The input parameters are copies, owned by the called function.
They can be manipulated like local data and must not be required
to be copied into "local data". The return value is also not
locally stored and therefore not hidden. Your rule would require
the replication of three floating-point variables NotGood(tm).
