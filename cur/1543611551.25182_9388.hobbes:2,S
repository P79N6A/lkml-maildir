In the first place I HAVE not only read the data-sheet, but probably
was one of the first to report the affect when first observed in
the days of XT machines, before there was a second cascaded controller.
If the effect was caused by the transient condition you describe, then
the second controller would also suffer from the same problem, i.e.,
its "IRQ7" is really IRQ15 when cascaded.
The problems with "spurious IRQ7" reared its head when the new
boards and cards became available with CMOS inputs with weak and/or
no pull-ups. If you leave a connector off the printer port, the
status bits will float and generate interrupts on IRQ7. You can
stop this, as previously taught, by disabling the IRQ enable
by writing bit 4 of the control-port (offset 1) to zero. You do
this on all known printer ports and you no longer get the kernel
messages.
So, before you issue another "rumors deleted" know-it-all retort,
observe that you can "mysteriously" stop the problem by mucking
with the printer control port. This certainly seems to disprove
your INTA theory.
