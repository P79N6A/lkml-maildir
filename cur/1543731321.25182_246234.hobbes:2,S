That sounds quite good, in my opinion.

Clearly open-source code that does it all would be nice, whether in user
space or kernel space. But lacking that, a kernel driver that does the
basics (ie you can still use it without any binary stuff), coupled with a
user library that can decode the compressed frames is pretty good already.
One thing to note that people may not understand: open source is about
more than "rabid zealotry" like some people seem to think. Open source is
_important_ from a technical angle. Not just looking for bugs and
supporting it, but for "small details" like "hey, it works on my ppc64
machine too".
The fact is, Linux has been a hell of a lot more successful at moving to 
things like x86-64 and ppc64 than Windows will _ever_ be. And the reason 
is open source drivers. 
So guys, this is not about zealotry. This is about hardnosed technical
decisions where closed-source binary drivers are actually _detrimental_ to
Linux because they have a tendency to lock people into setups that aren't 
good.
Whenever somebody says "accept the driver to help users", they are missing
the big picture. A binary driver SCREWS OVER users on other architectures.  
It pretty much guarantees that those other architectures will never be
supported. (And that's totally ignoring the maintenance issues even on
regular x86).

I'd be leery.
In ALSA, the module interface is about open source drivers, and whatever
binary modules exist are very much a small detail that almost nobody 
really needs to care about. It seriously sounds like the PWC case would be 
different, with the binary codecs being the most important ones. That 
makes any open-source ones pretty pointless.
So I'd personally much prefer the user mode approach. At that point it's 
still closed-source, but at least there is not even a whiff of a "hook" 
inside the kernel.
