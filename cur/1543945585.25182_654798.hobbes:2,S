Commit 0ad34f5f5f12861d4a18542c1a26284023b07a8d produces the following
build failure on ARM:
  CC      arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.o
In file included from /home/bb3081/project/kernel/orion/arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c:242:

free_mem_end_ptr is only defined on a few different architectures so this
commit probably effects others. After reverting this commit (below)
2.6.25-rc2-mm1 seems fine on two Marvell Orion based ARM boards.

    inflate-refactor-inflate-malloc-code
    Inflate requires some dynamic memory allocation very early in the boot
    process and this is provided with a set of four functions:
    malloc/free/gzip_mark/gzip_release.
    The old inflate code used a mark/release strategy rather than implement
    free.  This new version instead keeps a count on the number of outstanding
    allocations and when it hits zero, it resets the malloc arena.
    This allows removing all the mark and release implementations and unifying
    all the malloc/free implementations.
    Work initially done by Matt Mackall, updated to a recent version of the
    kernel by me.
