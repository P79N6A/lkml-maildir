Did you run ipcs without any arguments? If so, it should only call 
shmctl(SHM_INFO) and shmctl(SHM_STAT), so the only two spinlocks involved 
should be either shmem_inode_info->lock in shm_get_stat() or 
kern_ipc_perm->out_lock in ipc_lock().
Could you please try what is the output with the attached patch below, so 
that we know which spinlock buggers?
Also, could you please provide strace of the first (segfaulting) 
invocation of ipcs?

BTW any idea where does the '2b' come from? (it's single-bit flip).
