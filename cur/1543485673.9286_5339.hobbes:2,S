   I'm coming late to this topic, but with a good reason: I just figured
   out today that syslogd's fsyncs have been the cause of some major
   performance problems on an ISP's central server. Load averages have
   been unreasonably high and gradually getting worse. Today we realized
   that there is a weekly cycle to it, and it matches the cycle of the
   log rotation of /var/log/messages. As this log file grows (currently
   36 megs with 2 days left before rotation) and beyond, with syslogd
   fsync'ing every line it writes, syslogd hangs for long periods of
   time, and when syslogd is hung, lots of other stuff hangs.
Hmm.  That's an interesting problem.  This is the first time someone's
called it to my attention that syslog was calling fsync() all the time,
and obviously this causes a problem if there's a lot of syslogging going
on and the log files are large.
No, 2.2.1 won't do much better than 2.0.36, I don't think.  I've whipped
up some patches to 2.2.1 which should solve the problem.  It probably
wouldn't be too hard to backport them to 2.0.37, if someone were really
2.2-phobic.  
What the patch does is keep an array of the last four blocks which were
modified since the last fsync().  If there have been no more than four
blocks modified, then the ext2 filesystem can do a "fast fsync", which
just flushes those four (or fewer) blocks to disk, without having to
walk all of the indirect blocks looking for modified blocks.  This
should be extremely effective for programs like syslog which are doing
frequent fsync()'s with minimal amounts of data written between calls to
fsync().
A warning about this patch:
It's less than 2 hours old.  Just because the patch is against a stable
kernel doesn't mean that the patch is stable!  I've lightly tested it,
and it works fine under my test environment; but if you install it on
your production environment and it blows up and takes out all of your
data, don't go crying to me.  Try it out on a scratch monkey first....
