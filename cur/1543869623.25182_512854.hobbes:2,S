It appears that for low memory kernel will ignore incomplete pages for sure. I 
hope it does the same for high memory - but for now I just throw this in and 
pray :) This also significantly simplifies patch.
As this touches quite sensitive field, I Cc Andrew - if he considers this 
appropriate for mm; or would you do it as part of your tree? Also he probably 
can easily clarify memory allocation questions :p

Subject: [PATCH] Mark e820 reserved memory areas as nosave for suspend/resume
From: Andrey Borzenkov <<arvidjaar@mail.ru>>
This fixes bug 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7995.
 From
lkml discussion (http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=116514878500001&r=1&w=2):

First, if you want the reserved memory areas to be left alone by swsusp,
you need to mark them as 'nosave'.  On x86_64 this is done by the function
e820_mark_nosave_range() in arch/x86_64/kernel/e820.c that can be ported to
i386 with no problems.  However, we haven't found that very useful, so far,
since no one has ever reported any problems with the current approach,
which is to save and restore them.
=============
The patch adds adapted x84_64 version for i386. It differs from x86_64
in that
- it does not touch memory regions not covered by e820 table (I simply
have no idea if this is appropriate to do)
- it properly marks also partial pages (like the initial one in second
line below). Apparently kernel won't allocate and use such pages, so there
is nothing to preserve there.
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
The region in question starts at ee800. This is likely true for x86_64 as
well.
