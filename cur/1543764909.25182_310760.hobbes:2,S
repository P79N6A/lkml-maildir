You'd dowload all the sha1 objects (they don't actually do anything to
_your_ state - they only show the possible other states), and then it's a 
"simple thing" to generate a full tree of your local HEAD commit and 
compare it to a full tree of the remove HEAD commit.
If you then want to merge, you already have all the data. If you don't,
you can then prune your object tree from the stuff you don't use (fsck
already effectively does all the connectivity work, it just never removes
unreferenced files).
