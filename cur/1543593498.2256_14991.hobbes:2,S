Hi,
A little test-question. I am getting some strange timings...
Hardware: PIIX4:
00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01) (prog-if 80 [Master])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64
        I/O ports at ffa0 [size=16]
and a Creative 52mx CD-ROM (managed with kernel ide, master on IDE1)
and a Yamaha 8424 CDRW (also IDE, with ide-scsi+sg).
Software: 2.4.5-ac9+andre-ide-patch
Test: read a big file (634Mb) to disk.
The copy takes nearly 9 minutes from the 52x Creative and 3.5 from the
24x Yamaha. ???
Can it be soft ? The difference between ide-scsi and native ide ?
Or just the Creative hardware is s... ?
