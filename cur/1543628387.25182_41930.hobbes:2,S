Hi!
I spent some time today to find this patch, and I would really like to see
it go into one of the next 2.4 kernels. Since it is quite trivial, I hope
that should not be a problem, right?
I changed the description fields for vendor and model because it seems to
work for different devices from different vendors.
It works with my "PQI TravelFlash Single Slot" CF Card reader.
Thank you!
Greetings
Gert
