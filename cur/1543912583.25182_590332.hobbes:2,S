Interesting claim, please substantiate.

Actually it changes wait-runtime to a normalized value and it changes 
nothing about the rounding error I was talking about.
It addresses the conversion error between the different units I was 
mentioning in an earlier mail, but the value is still rounded.

Did you even try to understand what I wrote?
I didn't say that it's a "common problem", it's a conceptual problem. The 
rounding has been improved lately, so it's not as easy to trigger with 
some simple busy loops.
Peter's patches don't remove limit_wait_runtime() and AFAICT they can't, 
so I'm really amazed how you can make such claims.

Everytime I'm amazed how quickly you get to your judgements... :-(
Especially interesting is that you don't need to ask a single question for 
that, which would mean you actually understood what I wrote, OTOH your 
wild claims tell me something completely different.
BTW who is "we" and how is it possible that this meta mind can come to 
such quick judgements?
The basic concept is quite different enough, one can e.g. see that I have
to calculate some of the key CFS variables for the debug output.
The concepts are related, but they are definitively not "the same thing 
mathematically", the method of resolution is quite different, if you think 
otherwise then please _prove_ it.
bye, Roman
