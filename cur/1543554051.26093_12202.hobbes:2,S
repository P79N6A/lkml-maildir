Hi Phillip,
Ah, _now_ I understand what you are talking about (took me only slightly
over a month ;) and so can answer -- try making a huge bzImage (a few
megs) and boot with it. That was the main reason Werner added the extra
stuff somewhere around 2.3.99-preX.
Having said that, I still don't see why we actually need a specific label
(like pg1) for each successive page worth of pte's if we are filling them
with data starting from pg0 until we hit empty_zero_page (as I asked in my
other message).
Regards,
Tigran
PS. I cc'd the guy who was looking to extend the page tables for booting
with huge bss also...
