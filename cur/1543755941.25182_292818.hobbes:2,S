I don't think I have a HPET timer (3 year old 2.8Ghz P4). But when I
have HPET enabled in the kernel  I get a sysfs entry and consequently
a /dev/hpet entry. Should the HPET device be created if I don't have
the hardware? My expectation was that the sysfs entry should not have
been created. Is there a simple way to check if a box has a HPET
timer?
