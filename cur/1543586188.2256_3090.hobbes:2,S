Hi,
as far as I can see (you're talking about the "rel.tgz" archive from
the LinuxBETA directory, don't you?), this is just glue code for their
binary only "ftlib.o" driver.
No real open source here. Maybe Andre can work something from the
header structures.  But then again, the archive is dated 9/28/2000,
it's not exactly new...
	Regards
		Henning
