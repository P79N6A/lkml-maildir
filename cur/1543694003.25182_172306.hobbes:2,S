Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Can people hammer on this patch please?  I'd like this to be the version
that ships in 2.6.0.
2.1.18f:
 - Rewrite the Kconfig help
 - Always honour CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX_IOMAPPED.  Alpha people used to
   have it forced off, Sparc people used to have it forced on.  (Thanks
   to Dann Frazier for testing on Alpha)
 - Simplify the NVRAM handling a bit.
 - SYM_OPT_NO_BUS_MEMORY_MAPPING is never set.
 - Remove PCI DMA abstraction.  (Christoph Hellwig)
 - Redo SCSI midlayer registration and unregistration to allow module
   load/unload to work.  Now copes with scsi_add_host() failing.  (Thanks
   to Brian King for testing)
 - Replace bcmp() with memcmp().
 - Change the MAINTAINER entry to myself.
