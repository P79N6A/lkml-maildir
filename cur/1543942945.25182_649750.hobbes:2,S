I've had this argument before.  The conclusion is that spiteful people
insist on using the legal meaning for words which have explicitly been
said using plain English.  If you are spiteful, then by all means rant
about legal terms, but do so knowing that everybody understand what I mean.
Even in civil matters, it is necessary for the appellant to present a
case and the respondent may simply pick holes in it.
Further, don't forget that copyright violation is a criminal matter in
some jurisdictions.  I it is so in Australia, and attracts penalties
that include imprisonment.  In Australia, and I wonder if it isn't so in
USA, the legal interpretation that you so keenly insist upon, must
therefore apply.
I shall not engage in further debate about what the legal meaning is of
plain English terms.  It's a stupid argument suitable only for stupid
people.
