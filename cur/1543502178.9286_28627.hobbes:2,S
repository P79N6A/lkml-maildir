0xa does immediately branch to the address given at 40:67, whereas 0x9 does
a little more before. On my computer, (asus P5A, K6/2), it seems to
reinitialize something in the PCI chipsets, so it may be better than 0xA.

it must be the case because these functions were designed exactly for that use,
ie. jumping from protected to real mode and execute a given code to eventually
switch back to protected mode. Normaly, only the CPU reset line is activated
by an out 0x64,0xfe, so nothing else should be lost on the motherboard.

OK, sorry. I thought you meant "trying to do the best to get back to a
more or less stable kernel".

yes, I know. But since there are lots of places to look at (0:78, 0:522, ...)
I prefered find what differed from 2.2.10 and 2.3.5 concerning this.
One other problem I didn't speak about concerns people using loadlin. Their
interrupts might redirect to DOS drivers such as smartdrive, in which case
no dump would not work.
