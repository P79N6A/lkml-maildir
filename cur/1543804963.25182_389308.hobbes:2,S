In an early version, it was based on inode destruction. But inodes are
not destroyed
at process termination. If I understand the code, they're cached so that another
process that opens the same file will not have to build the inode from scratch.
So I based it on the dentry's refcount falling to zero, which occurs at process
termination. I did consider the problem of other references to the
inode. The only
scenario I could come up with was mapping the file using hard links. Then there
would be multiple dentrys referencing the same inode. This could be fixed by
adding a refcount to the futex_robust structure, but I never got around to doing
this.
