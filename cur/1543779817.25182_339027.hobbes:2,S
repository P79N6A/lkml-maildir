It probably won't help you much, but I had the same problem few months 
ago. There was a bug in smbfs which I tried to discuss with someone, and 
after failing to contact the maintainer, I sent the fix to Linus. I don't 
think even he managed to get a response from Urban or someone else. The 
fix went in so I stopped chasing it.
So it looks like smbfs is not maintained.
