Yeah good point ;) I just meant the wider "we".
With all the problems kprobes has, something like poking deep into
kernel internals seems like a good thing to use it for instead of
hardcoding that stuff into the kernel. If not, then why did we even
merge it in the first place?
We could distribute some systemtap scripts, and even distribute some
basic useful ones like this sort of page info in the kernel source
tree.

Seems like a very good idea.
