Hi, Hugh,
I mistook to send this mail to Hugh personally. This is resent. 
Hugh> I've not seen similar reports before.
I experienced similar problem using kernel 2.5.66 with fully preemption, 
Xfree86 4.3.0, glibc 2.3.2, and i810 driver.
When I restart X, then it completely hung up, and no keyboard
interruption was accepted. Threre seemed no way except power off.
I think this is much similar problem.
Hugh> Try rebuilding your kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y for more info?
I will try it.
Regards,
Watanabe
