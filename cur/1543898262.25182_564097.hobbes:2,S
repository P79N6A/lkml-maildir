Subject: instrumentation and kprobes really still "EXPERIMENTAL"?

  i just noticed that, in the Kconfig files that support KPROBES, both
the "Instrumentation support" menu is still listed as EXPERIMENTAL,
while Kprobes support within is simultaneously dependent on that same
selection.
  for one, that's kind of redundant and, for another, isn't kprobes
mature enough to not be considered experimental anymore?  after all,
red hat is shipping fedora 7 with kprobes support on by default.  that
kind of takes it out of the realm of experimental, doesn't it?
  in addition, while most of the KPROBES config options depend on
  KALLSYMS && EXPERIMENTAL && MODULES
the s390 architecture depends only on
  EXPERIMENTAL && MODULES
and its instrumentation support is *not* listed as experimental.
  also, the avr32 entry is in the file Kconfig.debug, and depends only
on DEBUG_KERNEL.  just an observation.
