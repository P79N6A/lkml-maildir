Hello Pekka, 
recompiled kernel with a patch below. The same story, f/w loading errors
not found (somehow I was able to trigger that yesterday), saw several
f/w restarts and then everything is freezing. Just before freezing the
usual messages :
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40 
ipw2200: Unknown notification: subtype=40,flags=0xa0,size=40
ipw2200: Firmware error detected.  Restarting.
ipw2200: Sysfs 'error' log already exists.
and freeeze ... :\ Sys-rq -T is at:
http://www.gemtek.lt/~zilvinas/dumps/trace.3
ipw2200 is stuck in ipw_request_direct_scan() in wpa_supplicant context.
ps.
Yesterday I've tried to reproduce the same problem at home (where I live
there are no access points at all). No crashes or freezes whatsoever.
Tortures had been like rmmod/insmod, run shell scripts forcing card to
scan constantly, running wpa_supplicant & kill -9 ... No luck too. No
slab or any other memory corruption related problems, rock stable. Then,
at work - it is here rather hostile environment , 18 APs are visible
through scanning:
$ /sbin/iwlist ath0 scan | grep ESSID | wc -l
18
Half of them are open (no encryption), other half WPA-PSK/WPA-RADIUS
enabled (WPA/WPA2 ... quite a mess really ...). Perhaps I should have
mentioned this earlier too. Well still quite a testing environment ...
:)
