Subject: [PATCH 2.6] 0/7 make kstrdup a library function
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/31/346

This series of patches create a "char *kstrdup(const char *s, int gfp)" library
function, and remove all the "private" strdup implementations in the kernel
tree.
1 - create a kstrdup library function
2 - remove private strdup from drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c
3 - remove private strdup from drivers/parport/probe.c
4 - remove uml_strdup (UML architecture)
5 - remove private strdup from net/sunrpc/svcauth_unix.c
6 - remove net_sysctl_strdup (networking)
7 - remove snd_kmalloc_strdup (sound)
This is just a cleanup to allow reusing the strdup code, and to prevent bugs in
future duplications of strdup.
These patches were built against 2.6.11-rc2-bk9. Patch 1/7 is similar to a patch
sent by Rusty Russell (although not quite the same), and 2/7 is also similar to
another patch sent today by Matt Domsch. So these should go over a vanilla
kernel without any of those patches.
All the patches depend on the first patch, but are otherwise independent.
