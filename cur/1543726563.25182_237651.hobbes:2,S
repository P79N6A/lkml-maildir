Hello!

And, even with your list of reasons, it is still very unlikely that anybody
will ever need the cached copy :-)  I still do not see a device which
would have shared decoders AND needed such initialization in userspace.
(Also, while we are speaking about video hardware -- they either have no
kernel driver, so nobody can ask for the copy, or they have one, but in
that case the BIOS mode switching calls and similar things can be accomplished
by the kernel driver with no need of messing with the ROM in the userspace.)
				Have a nice fortnight
