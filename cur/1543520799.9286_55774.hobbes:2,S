I have a new machine with the same config (2 NICs, same hub) and it was
experiencing intermittent problems communicating with other systems, and
after 2 days of trying to debug the problem, I finally discovered it was
caused by both cards replying to ARP requests.
After installing your patch, everything works perfectly! Thanks a lot! 
I totally agree with you that the current ARP behavior is incorrect. Or,
at very least, without the patch the system is simply unusable.
