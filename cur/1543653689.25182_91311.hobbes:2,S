There is no specification on what is supposed to be there.  For
compatiblity with programs written for old linux interfaces it is a good
idea to either place a copy of older kernel headers (2.2/2.4) or some
specific package to just provide those interfaces (like the redhat
glib-kernheaders rpm) there.
Note: glibc is one of the most-widely known packages that still
uses these obsolete interfaces
Note2: linux 2.5 headers slowly change to be no more compatible to those
interfaces, don't ever put copies of linux 2.5 headers there.

It doesn't matter.

The system integrator.

I've Cc'ed libc-alpha now because that's a glibc, not a kernel problem.
It's really a pity that glibc hasn't cought up _yet_.
