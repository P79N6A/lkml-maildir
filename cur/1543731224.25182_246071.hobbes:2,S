It seems that the netfilter developers are far to conservative in this
case.
- Linux 2.6 is itself is still not deemed completely stable.
- IPv6 support is still marked experimental.
So I doubt someone would blame them for pushing a not so well tested
patch in this case but the current netfilter implementation for IPv6 is
far from useful completeness.
