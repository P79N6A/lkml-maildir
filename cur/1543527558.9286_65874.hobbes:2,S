My initial thought would be that having both the ifdef
and the variable allows you to either not include SYSRQ
support (ifdef is false), or to have SYSRQ support (ifdef
is true) which defaults to being turned on (variable is
true) but can be turned off using some method (/proc/<something>
or a kernel debugger or something else). If you didn't
want the ability to turn it on and off, I agree that
having the variable on top of the ifdef is definitely
redundant.
