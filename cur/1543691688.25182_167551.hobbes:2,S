To avoid any ambiguity, the 'due to the mis-information...' part of
that sentence refers solely to my reason for sending out my own 'fact
sheet'.  It never was, and is not intended to convey in any sense that
the MEP I wrote to seemed more interested than most due to
mis-information in McCarthy's 'fact sheet'.

I contacted the same MEP again this morning stating my
dis-satisfaction at getting a duplicated response, and received a
satifactory reply explaining the reasons for this very promptly.
