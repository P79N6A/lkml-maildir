That is known and expected behaviour. It is not a bug.
The reason is that your 'ls' is also trying to stat() the file, and so
the client has to flush out all those writes in order to ensure that the
mtime/ctime are posixly correct.
By this, I mean that POSIX requires the filesystem to update the
mtime/ctime every time you issue a write() call. In the case of NFS,
this update is actually done when the client sends the WRITE rpc call to
to the server. IOW: in order to ensure that your mtime/ctime doesn't
change after you've issued the stat() call, we actually need to flush
out those backgrounded writes and wait for them to complete.
