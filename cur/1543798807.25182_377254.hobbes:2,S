Actually that gcc problem was unrelated to -Os vs -O2.  I was able to 
produce a test case that triggered the bug even with -Os at the time.  
It is true that, for the kernel, using -Os made the gcc bug more 
unlikely, but it could have happened regardless.  This particular gcc 
bug was fixed quite a while ago so using either -O2 and -Os on ARM 
should be fine (especially since we fail the compilation if a bad 
compiler triggers the bug).
