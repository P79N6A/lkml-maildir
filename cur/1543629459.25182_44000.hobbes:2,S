Greetings-
 I don't know if this is just for my compile, or if this has been seen as a
problem yet. I recently set up 2.5.13, however the same issue persisted with
2.5.7 as well. I can successfully mount smbfs, however, it seems that the
directory contents are not translated correctly.
bash-2.04$ ls -la
ls: b: No such file or directory
ls: d: No such file or directory
ls: m: No such file or directory
ls: M: No such file or directory
ls: r: No such file or directory
ls: R: No such file or directory
ls: r: No such file or directory
ls: R: No such file or directory
ls: s: No such file or directory
ls: w: No such file or directory
Every 1st letter of the directory contents.
I could not find anything about this in the archive, and was curious as to
anyone else having this problem, and any input I could get-
Thanks
