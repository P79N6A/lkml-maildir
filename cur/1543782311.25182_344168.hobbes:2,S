This should be fine. The effect of the first bit of code
plus all side-effects (if any) should be complete at the
first effective sequence-point (;) but you need to
change the procedure, dev_out, to:
static inline void dev_out(volatile u32 *regs, u32 value)
                            ^^^^^^^^
... or ... just use writel() directly. wmb() just tells
the compiler that memory has been changed. It already knows
that but you must use the keyword, "volatile" so the compiler
doesn't use something stale that's cached in registers.
