That's necessary, unless the cowid object has a linked list of all the
inodes which point to it, a bit like inodes having a linke list of all
parent directories which point to them.  That's not impossible, but
leaving the unnecessary cowid object is much simpler and will result
in less I/O (no doubly-linked list to update).  It can be garbage
collected when the last reference is followed to it.

Yes. </blush>
