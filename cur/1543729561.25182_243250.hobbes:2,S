Hello,
Recently the Debian kernel team has been discussing 2.4's configuration
system. We have a patched tg3.c which removes the firmware and adds a
dependency on CONFIG_FW_LOADER for cases where operation is impossible
without the firmware.
Initially, we changed this:
dep_tristate 'Broadcom Tigon3 support' CONFIG_TIGON3 $CONFIG_PCI
to this:
dep_tristate 'Broadcom Tigon3 support' CONFIG_TIGON3 $CONFIG_PCI $CONFIG_FW_LOADER
But this would still be selectable if CONFIG_FW_LOADER were not set at
all. Selecting it would not enable CONFIG_FW_LOADER either.
So, we tried this:
if [ "$CONFIG_FW_LOADER" != "n" -a "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" ]; then
   dep_tristate 'Broadcom Tigon3 support' CONFIG_TIGON3 $CONFIG_PCI $CONFIG_FW_LOADER
fi
and this STILL doesn't seem to work in the case that CONFIG_FW_LOADER
isn't set but CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is y.
Eventually we continued droning through the corner cases until reaching
if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" -a \
     "$CONFIG_HOTPLUG" = "y" -a \
     "$CONFIG_FW_LOADER" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_FW_LOADER" = "m" -a \
     "$CONFIG_CRC32" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_CRC32" = "m" ]; then
       dep_tristate 'Broadcom Tigon3 support' CONFIG_TIGON3 $CONFIG_PCI $CONFIG_FW_LOADER $CONFIG_CRC32
fi
which finally has the desired effect.
But is there really no way to say
config TIGON3
       select FW_LOADER
in 2.4?
CONFIG_PCMCIA_ATMEL also suffers from this problem.
Any ideas? Is it just that the old Configure scripts suck?
