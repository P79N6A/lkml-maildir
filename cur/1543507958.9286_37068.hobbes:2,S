	Negative.  The 3c515 from my understanding never did 10base2.
	I could be wrong, but what would the point be of having a
10base2 connector on a 10/100-BaseT card?  I'd find it more likely to
be a 3c509 than a 3c515, if it's a 3com of any kind, which seems
somewhat unlikely to me actually.
	USR was bought by 3com, but well after the probable date of
that machine's creation.  Also, IIRC, the 3c515 is something of a hack,
w/ a 3c905 chip and a PCI-to-ISA bridge on the card or something screwy
like that.  Unlikely it was even around when that machine was built.
	USR may have put out some net cards of their own, I'm not
sure, but you may just be better off trying it as a NE2k, and if that
doesn't work, picking up a el-cheapo network card for it. :)
