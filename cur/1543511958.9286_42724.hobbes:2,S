That would be a lot like having a CD-ROM filesystem that acted like an
inherited filesystem.  Thus, you could do a backup on track 1 and then
incrementally write only the files that had changed to subsequent tracks.
When you mounted the CD-ROM you'd see only the latest versions of the
files that were backed up.  I remember their being an IFS in the kernel
sometime ago, but it disappeared (I think (?)).
