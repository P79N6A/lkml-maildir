  Hi, Alexey.

There is a manual: Documentation/filesystems/devfs/README and it
should say this.

Drivers which create device entries specify a default permission. You
can override that with devfsd (the daemon). You can also use devfsd to
capture inode change events (chmod/chown), so you can build your own
persistence mechanism. In the future, devfs will tunnel through to
the mounted-over FS and save permissions there.
Note that if you want to set permissions on a group of devices
(i.e. /dev/vc/*) then using the existing devfsd-based mechanism is
more efficient in space usage.
