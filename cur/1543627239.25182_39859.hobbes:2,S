I've been testing 2.4.17 and 2.4.19-pre6 and see some similar issues.  I
have an Asus A7V w/ 1gig Athlon processor.  Using the onboard Promise
UDMA100 controller, I can read and write all day long to /dev/hde all by
itself...  However, after few minutes of any type of access to /dev/hdh,
/dev/hde suddenly starts having DMA errors and switches to PIO.  I'm on my
third DMA66 cable (yet it fights tightly), and am still seeing the exact
same issues.  I don't believe my IDE subsystem to be flaky.  hde is a WD
drive, and hdh is a Maxtor.
In one of my tests the contents /dev/hdh was additionally corrupted (a
write test to /dev/hdh1) so badly that the partion information changed
from type 83 to type 3 (Xenix), and the contents of a reiser partition so
badly damaged that a --rebuild-tree and later a --rebuild-sb to reiserfsck
didn't restore it to usable. (I put those options in at the request of
reiserfsck, and I haven't wiped the drive yet if someone would like
further tests against the reiserfs partition).
