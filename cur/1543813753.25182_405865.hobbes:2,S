Why did this line get split?

Indentation is off by one.

"some" appears twice in a row in this last sentence.  Anyway, it is
confusing.  I would re-word it to something like:
"If the write will update partial storage blocks, those blocks should be
read at this point (if they haven't been already) so that the updated
blocks can be properly written out."
