I still have the following argumet: the network and the network driver are
capable of transffering data at a high rate and the networking stack is
unable to keep the pace. If I used TCP probably TCP's flow control would
eventually slow the whole thing to a rate such all parts can handle. But
is there a way to overcome this situation and to avoid packets drop? If
this would happen then TCP would work at higher rates as well?? Perhaps
increase buffers sizes? Maybe the kernel is not designed to handle packets
rate like IPOIB can generate?
