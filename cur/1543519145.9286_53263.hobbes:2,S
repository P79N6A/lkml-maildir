I must object to this. In the 2.1.x days (x approx 126 - 132) I have put in many
hours to make the kernel compile under any circumstance, and although not
everything I patched was applied back then, most "stupid" things were. 
And 2.2.14pre12 should compile for you under ANY(1) circumstance. 
I will start working on pre13 tonight.

This is intentional. The interfaces have changed, and making the kernel not
compile the as-yet unfixed drivers is the best way to get them fixed.

(1) Except when you enable the hfmodem driver, that one has no maintainer
and is known to be broken non-modular.
