Sure, the RHS is a byte.  But devinfo->speed is an int and an lvalue. so
&devinfo->speed is an (int*) (so the cast in this case is a no-op),
and *(int*)&devinfo->speed is the same as *&devinfo->speed which is
the same as devinfo->speed.
But, *(int*)&devinfo->speed is an int no matter what type
devinfo->speed has.  So if for some reason, you decide to change the
type of devinfo->speed to a byte, say, the cast will still force
int format data to be stored, overwriting adjacent bits of memory (or
causing an unaligned store trap).
The cast is *wrong*, and potentially dangerous.
I'll submit a patch....

You are lost in a maze of BitKeeper repositories, all almost the same.
