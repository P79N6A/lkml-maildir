In fact, this videodev2.h header is meant to describe the public API for
V4L2. The current version have several kernel-specific stuff (under
__KERNEL define), but we are already working on cleaning those stuff. 
Currently, on V4L, all kernel-specific stuff are under include/media,
while the public stuff are under include/linux.
