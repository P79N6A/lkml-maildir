I've never seen this behaviour in a drive. All the drives I've seen mark bad sectors as "pending 
reallocation", they they return read errors on that sector unless they manage to jag a good read, in 
which case they then reallocate the sector. Or else they wait for you to write to the sector 
triggering a reallocation.
There may be drives less well behaved out there, but I've not come across them.
