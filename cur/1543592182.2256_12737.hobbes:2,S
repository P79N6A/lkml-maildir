Hi,
I came across this while developing a networked file system:
If I do the socket ops using standard kernel functions they block forever. The
solution I found in some old module was to load the FS segment with the value
of DS and then restore it.
Can someone please explain why this is needed? And isn't it architecture
dependent?
Thanx for your patience with a newbie...
Ruf
