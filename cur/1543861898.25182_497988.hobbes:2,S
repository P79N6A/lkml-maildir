It disabled it but I enabled it just for fun.

I now run 7.3.20-NAPI.
BTW. the Makefile is buggy: it does not get CC from kernel's Makefile.
Using wrong compiler can cause for example a reboot when loading the module.
(At least that's what happened with gcc-2.95.3 vs 3.x.x some years ago...)

I enabled TSO again.  I write again if TSO causes problems.
Why shouldn't it work with 100 Mbps?  Not that it would help a lot,
but I ask this on principle.
  /* disable TSO for pcie and 10/100 speeds, to avoid
   * some hardware issues */
Issues on the motherboard or the NIC?
