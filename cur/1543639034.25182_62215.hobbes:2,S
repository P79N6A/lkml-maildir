	You might not see them on linux-kenrel, but there are
lots of Linux users that are not comfortable compiling a custom
kernel (or even competent to do so), but are a bit more willing
to edit files and rerun a boot configuration utility like lilo.
	Linux users in the "I'm not a sysadmin" crowd (?) probably
don't care about the scan order of the pdc20265 IDE controller,
but people in the "I'm a sysadmin, not a programmer" crowd
may have legitimiate reasons to.
