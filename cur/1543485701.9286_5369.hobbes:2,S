So this is only a problem if additional nodes have to be added to the double
indirect blocks?

Would it be possible to pre-allocate a file until it fills up some double
indirect blocks (i.e. the amount of usual log activity until rotated) and
then write into it (possible with a flag telling the fs that there was no
sarse blocks before?).
