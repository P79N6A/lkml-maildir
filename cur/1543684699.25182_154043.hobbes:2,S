I have failed to get it working.
I tried both of the options under CPU features to enable the APIC, with
both settings of the kernel flag.
I also tried a SMP kernel, with no flag.
None of these showed any NMI interrupts in /proc/interrupts or any different
behaviour on unplugging with the network active.
Is a serial kernel likely to do anything in this case?
