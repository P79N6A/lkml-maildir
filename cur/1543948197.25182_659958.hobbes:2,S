Well, you need ordered metadata writes, barriers _and_ flushes with
some filesystems.
Merely writing all the data pages than issuing a drive cache flush
won't Do The Right Thing with those filesystems - someone already
mentioned Btrfs, where it won't.
But I agree that your suggestion would make a superb default, for
filesystems which don't provide their own function.
It's not optimal even then.
  Devices: On a software RAID, you ideally don't want to issue flushes
  to all drives if your database did a 1 block commit entry.  (But they
  probably use O_DIRECT anyway, changing the rules again).  But all that
  can be optimised in generic VFS code eventually.  It doesn't need
  filesystem assistance in most cases.
  Apps: don't always want a full flush; sometimes a barrier would do.
