I'd much rather we keep our current scheme because it makes 100% sense
for ARM since there is no "generic" configuration which covers a subset
of configurations.
To illustrate this fact, here's some statistics on the symbolic usage
between all the default configurations on ARM:
- 414 configuration symbols are only defined on one default configuration
  file.
- 281 configuration symbols occur in between 2 and 9 inclusive files.
- 122 configuration symbols occur between 10 and 46 files.
- 3 configuration symbols occur in all 47 default configuration files.
I'm far from happy doing any conversions to make this work.  The current
system was fine and fit our needs exactly.
