	Propably the stricter interpretation of rules regarding ##
	attribute concatenation directive, and resulting material.
	I found bugs in my own source regarding that issue when I
	begun to use 2.96 (RH rawhide back then) at one of my machines.
	Once I understood the warning/error, it was quick to fix
	things properly at my source.  Similar is needed for some
	Kernel macroes, IMO.
	Aside of that pre-processor noice I don't know if 2.96 is really
	buggy -- well, some strange combination of 2.96 20000702  and
	glibc-devel-2.1.92-5 causes one of my codes to fail, but I haven't
	determined what really is going on (very deep macro wonders there...)
	When compiled with RH kgcc (egcs-1.1.2, that is), it works.
