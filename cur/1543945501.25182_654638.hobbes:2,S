It was deemed best not to allow the guest to write to a page that has 
been swapped out and assigned to an unrelated host process.
One way to view the kvm shadow page tables is as hardware dma 
descriptors. kvm pins pages for the same reason that drivers pin pages 
that are being dma'ed. It's also the reason why mmu notifiers are useful 
for such a wide range of dma capable hardware.

If kvm releases a page, it must also zap any shadow ptes pointing at the 
page and flush the tlb. If you do that for all of memory you can't 
reference any of it.
Releasing a page has costs, both at the time of the release and when the 
guest eventually refers to the page again.

Yes, I'm obviously writing from a kvm-centric point of view. This is an 
important feature, as the virtualization future seems to be NUMA hosts 
(2- or 4- way, 4 cores per socket) running moderately sized guests. The 
ability to load-balance guests among the NUMA nodes is important for 
performance.
(btw, I'm also looking forward to memory defragmentation. large pages 
are important for virtualization workloads and mmu notifiers are again 
critical to getting it to work while running kvm).

Any sufficiently difficult bug is indistinguishable from a feature.
