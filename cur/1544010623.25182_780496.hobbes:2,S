If there's a single unit of sharable resource [such as an event counter, 
or a physical CPU], then there's just three main possibilities: either 
user 1 gets it all, or user 2 gets it all, or they share it.
We've implemented the essence of these variants, with sharing the resource 
being the sane default, and with the sysadmin also having a configuration 
vector to reserve the resource to himself permanently. (There could be 
more variations of this.)
What is your point?
