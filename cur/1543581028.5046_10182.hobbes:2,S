Last week we put 2.4.1 in our web server. (2.2 really couldn't
do the job - continue stalls, load average up to 800, etc.).
2.4 performs really nicely. Now the load avg rarely goes
over 4 and the machine is always responsive.
I noticed that zombies tend to exist for much more time than
with 2.2.x. e.g. in this moment, with medium load (700 httpd's),
there are around 70 zombie cgi's. There aren't processes stuck
in Z, they simply take more time to die. Strange.
Bye.
