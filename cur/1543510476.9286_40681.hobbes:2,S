I saw the same thing.  You can work around it by changing the
SSLCacheServerPort config parameter from a path (which causes it to
use a Unix-domain socket) to a number (which causes it to use a TCP
[UDP?]) port.
I don't know what the underlying problem is; I have other apps that
use Unix-domain sockets, and they work fine under 2.3.18.
