I also disagree.  Although it would be nice, it's not practical.  What
people want is strictly fixes and security related patches, and that
is ALL I propose to want to include.  Perhaps if the vendors
want a "common vendor" patch they could maintain it? ;)
So, to that end, I have made available:
(URL is 
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/current-updates/
)
linux-2.4.20-updates.patch: Contains all three patches below.  For the 
        primary fixes needed in the current release kernel.
Individual patches:
linux-2.4.20-ext3.patch: Fixes for ext3 data=journal umount patch, sync-fix
        patch, and use-after-free patch from Andrew Morton <akpm@digeo.com>.
linux-2.4.20-ptrace.patch: Alan Cox relased a patch against 2.4.20 which
        did not apply cleanly (perhaps it was his -ac tree).  This will
        apply cleanly and compile under i386 to the clean 2.4.20 source
        tree.
linux-2.4.20-tg3.patch: Jeff Garzik and David S. Millers tg3 1.4c
        driver for 2.4.20.
Enjoy!
Regards
James Bourne
