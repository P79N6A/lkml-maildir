You have a talent for turning people's argument into something else.
You dropped my example about the wire limitation. It was describing my point
about constraints and PMU as 2nd class citizen. I'd rather have a new
constrained
PMU feature that no new feature at all. You also seem to limit your
world to x86,
you have to look beyond like Itanium and Power, for instance.
I know quite well that the PMU is used for debugging internally and early on,
so don't lecture me on this! I have participated in the architectural design of
some.

You think I am not aware of that?I know that quite well because I talk to the
PMU architects on a regular basis trying to get them to add new features and
make the PMU easier to manage. And I make sure I broaden my horizon
beyond x86.
And yes, the PMU is becoming more and more critical and a true-value add.
That's good for end-users as long as the new features can be exposed.

That's not a valid argument! Perfmon, unlike any other existing API, has
exposed all advanced features of all existing PMU models and across
multiple architectures.

You current API does not offer access to any of the advanced features of
X86, like PEBS, IBS, LBR and others,  let alone on the other architectures.
So again your arguments are unfounded.

I think the number of syscalls is irrelevant, that's not how I measure
the usefulness of an API.
What matters is the functionalities. Any performance monitoring API should have:
   - create a session
   - program the registers
   - start and stop on demand and has many times as you want
   - attach to a thread or CPU
   - read the register values
   - advanced support for event-based sampling

You have no validation to prove you chose the right level.
As if the perfmon project did not put the PMU on the forefront.
Who is going to buy that?
