When suspending, pci_save_state() would have saved off those values (all
1s) which is what it is restoring.  That function gets called if there
is no driver specific suspend function to call.  On suspend, is there
any driver loaded for the device?
And what type of PCI device is this?

Ick.
Any chance you can test -mm and see if that helps with suspend/resume?
Linus's new suspend framework is in there, and that's the way forward
for these kinds of issues.
