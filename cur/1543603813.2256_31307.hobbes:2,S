The problem is people argue that a preemptible kernel lowers throughput
since I/O is now interrupted.  Of course, if they fear that, maybe we
should switch to cooperative multitasking!
Anyhow, tests show the preemptible kernel has a negligible effect on
throughput -- in fact in some cases we improve it since overtime we
better distribute system load.  This is one reason why I ask for dbench
or bonnie benchmarks from the preemption users.  Results are good.
The other concern is that added complexity is a Bad Thing, and I agree,
but the complexity of preemption is insanely low.  In fact, since we use
so many preexisting constructs (such as SMP locks), its practically
nothing.

Agreed.

That is my thought process, too.
