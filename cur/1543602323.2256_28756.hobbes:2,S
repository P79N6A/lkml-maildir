| A write cache can and will speed up linear writes on typical ide setups.
Pedantically I guess that's true, but I wouldn't expect any significant
change unless the drive were badly fragmented, since the write cache on
the drive should hold enough data to allow all data to a track to be
written in a single revolution.
Write cache makes a big difference in normal use, where seeks and such
can be optimized, but for a single process writing a single file (ie.
dd) I don't see where it would or could help much.
Since the single process is not a typical case on most systems, I don't
see that it's a burning question.
