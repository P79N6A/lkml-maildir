Matthew,
I like the "none" which is no doubt a place holder at
the moment.
For the user space to do discovery, it either needs an out
of band mechanism (e.g. IP) or the ability to talk to a
host in the absence of any "devices" (targets or logical units).
That requires a device node (e.g. /dev/mptctl) or something
equivalent in sysfs (yuk).
Your "none" explanation could be slightly extended to say
that the LLD (and/or its firmware) might do the discovery. As an
example the SAS-2 draft now has self-configuring expanders
(the terms "edge" and "fanout" have been dropped) which
effectively discover the topology and track changes, configuring
themselves and dumber expanders as required. Then host discovery
becomes importing the topology from an external device. However
not all devices may be visible to self-configuring expanders
(e.g. a SATA disk could be directly attached to a SAS HBA). So
some extra work may be required.
So at one extreme the discovery process may be distributed
and at the other extreme there is no discovery at all.
With modern transports (e.g. FC, SAS, iSCSI?) having world
wide unique names who needs discovery?
