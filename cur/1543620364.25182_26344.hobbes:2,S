I think this API is really ugly.  If both pathes actually do the same,
just with different defaults, one lock function with a flag would be
much nicer.  Also why do we need two unlock functions?
What about the following instead:
	combi_lock(struct combilock *x, int spin);
	combi_unlock(struct combilock *x);

This looks really ugly.  I'd really prefer an automatic fallback from
spinning to sleeping after some timeout like e.g. solaris adaptive
mutices.

You are no supposed to sleep in irq context, so irq-save combi-locks
don't make that much sense, IMHO.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
