I do not like this argument at all. I have yet to see a formal
example of a case where the default permissions on a device are
inadequate for good security, and for great security permissions
alone are insufficient.

Only if the USB driver is unaware of USB topology.  
A user space daemon's only information on the current 
bus structure has to come from the driver.  Since this
means that the driver has to be providing the daemon with
the information necessary to determine the proper device 
naming, as well as registering an appropriate Major/Minor
pair for the device in question, it is conceptually simpler
to simply register the device by name directly from the
driver.  Fewer steps, less possibility of having to
walk around wearing a brown paper bag.

Register a device whose name is /dev/fs/label.
No daemon needed.

Only if we do an insufficient job of designing devfs.
I am quite certain that it can be improved, it is the work
of few.

My point is that a user space daemon is superfluous if we
can register devices by name rather than by Maj/Min pairs.

Huh? 
Where did this come from?
You do not need to edit files to run ppp, nor do you for minicom.
You do need to edit /etc/inittab for getty's, but you need to do
that if you want to enable logins on any device.

I fail to see where devfs fails to go far enough.
It is an enabler for doing wonderful things with drivers.
No longer limited by Major/minor pairs, I can now register
/dev/mydevices/foo* and have them show up when the driver
is loaded.  
Just as an example:
  In working with the epca.c driver and devfs, I decided
that it would be nice if the ttyD* devices did not show
up until after the card had been initialized. So I moved
the tty registration to post-initialization.  This way
when the driver was loaded and cards not initialized you
could only see the initilization device, but after running
the initialization program you had precisely the number of tty devices
registered as were initialized.  
This way it was easy to see what state the cards were in, whether
the init program had been run, and whether there were any initialization
failures, all with "ls".
Of course none of this works without devfs, so I suppose
I was just wasting time...

I've got a good imagination, devfs gives me a tool
that I can use to impliment things that I can imagine
more easily and elegantly than a pure userspace solution. 
Daemon: select() /dev/USB/status wait...wait...
Driver: Hey! I just registered /dev/USB/modem1!
Daemon: Cool! let me tell my user about it!

Merely populating dev in a consistant and logical manner is a good
design goal.  To do so in an efficient and flexible manner as well
is admirable. To throw such an artifice out because it doesn't provide
for features that are out of the realm of maintaining a sane /dev
directory is not good system architecture.
