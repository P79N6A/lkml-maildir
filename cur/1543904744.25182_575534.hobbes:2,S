True.
I personally only troll lkml for unloved patches, so I suspect that a
random patch which is sent to mailing-list-A and not to lkml has a higher
probability of getting lost than one which is sent to both lists.  Plus
it'd be nice to get lkml's patch-to-noise ratio above one percent.
So I'd suggest that you rework the text here to make it clearer that
patches should go to lkml _and_ to the subsystem-specific mailing list.
