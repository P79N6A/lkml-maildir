One thing we should be careful: if syscalls aren't needed in the app and
all the MMIO space can be mmapped by the device driver and the app can
run fully in userland and be invoked from irqs, then going with the
"diamond hard" is not more complicated than going with the weak
solutions. The "diamond hard" will work in userland too, and it won't be
substantially different from a soft-RT "metal hard" approach like
preempt-RT. So it'd be very bad if people would choose preempt-RT if
they could equally easily go with RTAI or other "diamond hard" solutions
that are order of magnitude simpler and safer.

Those are certainly areas where linux kernel has to be involved, and in
turn the "diamond hard" isn't feasible anyway without huge efforts. So
for them I definitely agree preempt-RT scheduling irqs in userland is
ok.

As you said what I've always meant with hard-RT is the "diamond hard"
thing. After all in linux everything that called hard-RT (RTAI, RTLinux,
nanokernel) was "diamond hard" so far, preempt-RT is the first time in
linux where I see the word "hard-RT" combined with something not
"diamond hard".
thanks.
