Yes. In itself nothing is wrong with that, I suppose.
In some cases not-reusing these buffers would waste a lot of time.
But if the running Linux system is not the only one that fiddles
with the disk contents then you'll have to explicitly invalidate
the buffers, e.g., using "blockdev --flushbufs device".
