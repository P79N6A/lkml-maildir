 	  This driver is for wanXL PCI cards made by SBE Inc.  If you have
 	  such a card, say Y here and see <
http://hq.pm.waw.pl/pub/hdlc/>.
 
-	  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
-	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
-	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
-	  will be called wanxl.
+	  To compile this as a module, choose M here: the module will be
+	  called wanxl.
 
 	  If unsure, say N here.
