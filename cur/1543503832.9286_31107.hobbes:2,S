update is strange on my work machine.  (kernel 2.3.11, compiled
with gcc 2.7.2.3, using debain 2.1 distribution)
update seems to be busy all the time according to "top", causing
a load of at least 1 all the time.  Compiles and other heavy
stuff doesn't seem slower though, so I tought this was a 
reporting problem only until I tried 2.3.11 on my home machine.
There is no heavy cpu usage here.  Both machines are uniprocessors.
