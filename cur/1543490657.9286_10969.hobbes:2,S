So don't do that then :)
More seriously, presumably you'd run a util to prepare the system for
being gutted, which untied said processes, printed / killed processes with
locked-in pages, and waited until the said chunks of memory were free. Or
suspend the relevant processes to swap (Gabor's patches work really well
here). You'd need to make sure nothing else locked pages into the area you
wanted to remove while you were trying to empty it, of course.
