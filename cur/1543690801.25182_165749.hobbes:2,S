Here is an update to my patchset:
http://kernel.kolivas.org
Includes:
O(1) Scheduler
Batch scheduling
Preemptible
Low Latency
O1int interactivity
AA VM addons
Read Latency2
Variable HZ
Supermount-NG
Bootsplash
XFS
GRSec
Desktop tuning
Split out patches available on the website; incrementals available on request 
(my bandwidth / storage is limited sorry).
Changes:
The O1int interactivity backport is more substantial now bringing it in line 
with O20.1int with only the nanosecond resolution missing from the 2.6 work.
CK vm hacks and swap prefetch were dropped and AA Vm addons were merged as 
part of the default - lack of time prevented me maintaining ck vm properly.
XFS Merged - thanks Rik
GRSec Merged - thanks Rik
The slow termination of applications is fixed by the completion of the 
interactivity backport to this version.
Feel free to send me comments, queries, suggestions, patches and bug reports.
