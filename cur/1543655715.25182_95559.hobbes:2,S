Don't. You are right about this one, a client originated connection will
have an ARP entry and route back by the original route. Connections
originated on the dual-homed system might put a packet out on either NIC,
from any IP, that's a different issue, and the whole hidden interface
patch really doesn't address it.
I was mixing things from two problems I've seen, sorry for any confusion.
