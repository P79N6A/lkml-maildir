I can confirm the the problem on my Promise SATAII-150 TX4
with the 2.6.12. However after a immediate downgrade to
2.6.11 the problem persist.
updating the controller bios to 1.00.0.34 didn't helped either.
The kernel freezes the interrupt from the satalib after a short
time. strangly it occurs only after even numbers (like
200000 or 300000). Bevor the freez, all devices are working fine
except for some
[kernel] irq 18: nobody cared!
