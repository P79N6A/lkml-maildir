This is still rejecting:
patching file drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_mm.c
Hunk #2 FAILED at 43.
Hunk #4 FAILED at 68.
Hunk #5 FAILED at 1217.
Hunk #6 FAILED at 1225.
Hunk #7 FAILED at 1245.
5 out of 7 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file

Could you rebase this patch to the bk snapshots so we can look at
applying it?
Thanks,
James
