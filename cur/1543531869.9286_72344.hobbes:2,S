    I disagree strongly......
Look at the cfdisk source. HDIO_GETGEO occurs only in one place.
This single place reads:
-------------------------------------------
void get_kernel_geometry(void)
{
#ifdef HDIO_GETGEO
    struct hd_geometry geometry;
    if (!ioctl(fd, HDIO_GETGEO, &geometry)) {
        kern_heads = geometry.heads;
        kern_sectors = geometry.sectors;
    }
#endif
}
-------------------------------------------
You see? The field geometry.cylinders is never used.
So, to cfdisk a HDIO_GETBIGGEO would not make a difference.
(And if HDIO_GETGEO is removed altogether, cfdisk
will still work fine. You see, I want to eliminate
all that reminds of disk geometry.)

    No, but you do write to the NV ram on the drive interface
    that does not get changed even if the power is cycled.
Ha! I just did these things this afternoon.
A reboot doesnt reset things, but a power cycle does,
at least as long as one does not set VV to 1.
