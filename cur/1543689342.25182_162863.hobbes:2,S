I don't think the initial development baby-steps are *too* bad, and don't
even have to be done on a NUMA box - a pair of PCs connected by 100baseT
would work. Personally, I think the first step is to do task migration - 
migrate a process without it realising from one linux instance to another. 
Start without the more complex bits like shared filehandles, etc. Something 
that just writes 1,2,3,4 to a file. It could even just use shared root NFS, 
I think that works already.
Basically swap it out on one node, and in on another, though obviously
there's more state to take across than just RAM. I was talking to Tridge
the other day, and he said someone had hacked up something in userspace
which kinda worked ... I'll get some details.
I view UP -> SMP -> NUMA -> SSI on NUMA -> SSI on many PCs -> beowulf cluster
as a continuum ... the SSI problems are easier on NUMA, because you can
wimp out on things like shmem much easier, but it's all similar.
