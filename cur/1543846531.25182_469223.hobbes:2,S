No, bay eject should go through userspace so that it gets a chance to
do cleanup (e.g., unmount filesystems) or to tell the user to abort
the eject (e.g., filesystems in use, or system running on bay battery
power).
And the driver of whatever is in the bay should be informed before
power is removed so it can do its own cleanup (e.g., spin down disk).
This can also be done by userspace.
So your current code is fine, and the comment should probably be
removed lest someone tries to follow it.
