-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Don't clobber register %l0 while checking TI_SYS_NOERROR value in
syscall return path.  This bug was introduced by:
db7d9a4eb700be766cc9f29241483dbb1e748832
Problem narrowed down by Luis F. Ortiz and Richard Mortimer.
I tried using %l2 as suggested by Luis and that works for me.
Looking at the code I wonder if it makes sense to simplify the code
a little bit. The following works for me but I'm not sure how to
exercise the "NOERROR" codepath.
