I also get this one with apt-get dist-upgrade:
(dpkg/11902): 444us [0 jiffy] non-preemptible critical section violated
300 us preempt threshold starting at copy_mm+0x31b/0x3f0 and ending at
copy_page_range+0x144/0x290

 [<c0113dc2>] touch_preempt_timing+0x32/0x40
 [<c013b7b4>] copy_page_range+0x144/0x290
 [<c0114922>] copy_mm+0x362/0x3f0
 [<c0115243>] copy_process+0x3d3/0xb60

 [<c01049b9>] sys_clone+0x29/0x30
 [<c0105e57>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
Shouldn't fork()'ing a dpkg process be a lot faster than that, with
copy-on-write etc?
