Subject: 2.2.19 breaks iBCS2: Patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/4/2/53

in 2.2.19, linux/include/asm-i386/uaccess.h is missing the line
#define strlen_user(str) strnlen_user(str, ~0UL >> 1)
putting it back makes iBCS2 work again.
Btw will iBCS2 ever be ported to the 2.4 kernel? I'm stuck with 2.2
until this is ported.
