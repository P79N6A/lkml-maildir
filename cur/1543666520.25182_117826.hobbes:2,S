Because it makes no difference at all on x86, since gcc will ignore
"const" for inline functions. At least that used to be true.

Can't help you on that one, but it looks like it uses various helper
functions for doing the x86-64 per-processor data structures, and I bet
those helper functions are shared by _other_ users who definitely want
to have their data properly re-read. Ie "current()" may be constant in
process context, but that sure isn't true about a lot of other things in
the per-processor data structures.
