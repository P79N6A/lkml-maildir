no CONFIG_APM and yes, this is my problem.
A very hard way to figure this out,
and too much noise. Sorry for this.
It is not the first time, I had to change my .config to maintain a
feature of the kernel after an upgrade. I think, you are aware of this
an I have no suggestion for improvement. Now this old laptop is
running perfectly again with the latest kernel.
Thankyou for this,
Wolfgang
