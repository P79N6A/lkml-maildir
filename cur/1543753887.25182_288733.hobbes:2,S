Indeed, the more hands the lighter the load.
Another issue (than indirection) that I think needs to be addressed at 
some stage is freeing up the memory occupied by the code of the 
schedulers that were unlucky not to be picked.  Something like what 
__init offers only more selective.
And the option of allowing more than one CPU per run queue is another 
direction that needs addressing.  This could allow a better balance 
between the good scheduling fairness that is obtained by using a single 
run queue with the better scalability obtained by using separate run queues.
