Hi,
I have tried to compile a kernel (2.4.8) with bootp support.
i make 
dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0
and i boot on the floppy.
(I have found some doc who say that work)
but for me ip configuration don't work, i haven't any bootp request.
I look at the file net/ipv4/ipconfig.c
I see that
int ic_enable __initdata = 0;			/* IP config enabled? */
ic_enable is set in function  ip_auto_config_setup
with 
ic_enable = (*addrs && 
		(strcmp(addrs, "off") != 0) && 
		(strcmp(addrs, "none") != 0));
so i must pass an argument ?
how could I do that on my floppy ? there are nothing about that in doc ?
also if I change 
int ic_enable __initdata = 0;			/* IP config enabled? */
whit 
int ic_enable __initdata = 1;			/* IP config enabled? */
all seem work well, i have bootp request so why should i need this
argument ?
thank for any help
