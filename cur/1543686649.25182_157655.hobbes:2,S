Perhaps it's too clever, because some users configure the repeat delay
in their BIOS to longer than 250ms.
It is fine if you are able to reliably program the keyboard to use the
250ms delay, though.
Aren't there some keys which report DOWN and UP but which don't repeat?
The PS/2 keyboard protocol is utterly absurd.
