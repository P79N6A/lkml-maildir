Do you have a sound driver loaded?  I can use my CardBus Ethernet card
only without a sound driver, then the CardBus bridge and Ethernet card
show up on IRQ10.  Mysteriously however loading the i810_audio driver
(for a 440MX chip) moves the bridge to IRQ11 (the same as the 440MX).
No lockup, but the bridge and Ethernet card don't work then.  I'd be
interested what happens in your case.
More specifically, as the PCI code enables the 440MX sound device it
logs that it uses the same IRQ as the cb bridge, meaning the IRQ changed
already.  This is 2.4.0-test12.
