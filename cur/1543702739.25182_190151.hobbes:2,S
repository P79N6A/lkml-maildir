I don't know if reverting to 2.4.22 is the correct fix, the change was made after this
mail from Alexey http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-net&m=105915597804604&w=2 ,
he states that giving out ifindex is a bug. I don't understand the problem yet but I'm
looking into it.
BTW: Why do we need a route lookup at all ? Couldn't we just use the first address on 
dev->in_dev->ifa_list ?
Best regards,
Patrick
