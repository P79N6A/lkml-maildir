It's probably the MIME type. text/plain vs application/octet-stram vs
others. The type comes from the web server for http transfers. For FTP,
things are stange when downloaded with a browser. If you use a
http-style proxy/cache then the proxy adds the mime type (to the best of
its knowledge). For direct connections, it's fully up to the browser to
decide.
Also, the encondig header may have influence for http transfers.
