I believe so, or in other words a minor penalty to average latency impact
to get a reduction in maximum latency [though I am not sure I actually
measured such a reduction].

I think we agree on this assessment. I don't think the threading overhead
is 100 usec but more likely 50 usec [at least on my hardware - see below].
That the extra 50 usec puts us over the 100 usec measure is unfortunate.

Please note that to get the ping times I stated, I set the priority of
ksoftirqd/0 and /1 to 99 (along with the IRQ threads). Others won't be
so generous and get different results.
I believe the longer duration with -20RT is due to the threading overhead.
Look at the numbers for -20PK and -20RT, the minimums are
  -20PK 0.089 msec (or 089 usec)
  -20RT 0.134 msec (or 134 usec)
or a difference of about 50 usec. If the sequence of steps is something
like
  Network Interrupt -T-> Network IRQ -T-> ksoftirqd/0 -> ping reply
on -RT and
  Network Interrupt -> Network IRQ -> soft IRQ -> ping reply
on -PK, the difference measured is likely reasonable.
[where -T-> represents a new thread activation, and -> represents something
like a function call]
Again, the benefit of PREEMPT_RT (over PREEMPT_DESKTOP) should be reduced
maximum latencies with a modest (or very little) impact to overall
performance / throughput. We are certainly getting a lot closer on
reaching that goal.
