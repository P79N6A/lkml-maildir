If you're a Republican he's "wishy-washy", if you're a Democrat he's 
"flexible and adaptable to changing conditions." If you're not a US 
resident you're confused by the previous sentence, please ignore it's an 
in-joke (or tragedy).

That sounds like the eventual solution. A vendor to common format 
conversion library, and with luck someone will be clever and let the 
driver select it in a nice acceptable way. Thought: after open an ioctl 
to tell you which conversion to use? The optimal mechanics are 
inobvious, but I think the library is the right idea.
