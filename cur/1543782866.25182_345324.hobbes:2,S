Jesper,
Thanks for the patches. I'll take a look at the entry.S one and will 
pass it along to Andres, and will incorporate the signal.c patch.
I am currently working on the system call interface and am removing the 
non-rt signal calls, so the signal.c patch probably doesn't apply 
cleanly anymore.
Thanks,
~Chris
