Filippo,
would you please resend your patch including the lines you have omitted ?
Jeff is right, those lines are explicitly labelled as a fixup, so either
we merge the complete patch, or nothing at all.
I expect to release 2.4.35 around the end of this month, so if you can
provide me with an acceptable patch in time so that I can run at least
one -rc with it, I'm OK to merge it (provided that Jeff has no objection
of course). I will merge your other patch (VIA) at the same time.
Thanks in advance,
Willy
