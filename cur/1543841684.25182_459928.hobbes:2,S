Subject: [PATCH] ext3: wrong error behavior
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

SWsoft Virtuozzo/OpenVZ Linux kernel team has discovered that ext3 error
behavior was broken in linux kernels since 2.5.x versions by the following patch:
2002/10/31 02:15:26-05:00 tytso@snap.thunk.org
Default mount options from superblock for ext2/3 filesystems
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/gnupatch@3dc0d88eKbV9ivV4ptRNM8fBuA3JBQ
In case ext3 file system is mounted with errors=continue (EXT3_ERRORS_CONTINUE)
errors should be ignored when possible. However at present in case of any error
kernel aborts journal and remounts filesystem to read-only. Such behavior was
hit number of times and noted to differ from that of 2.4.x kernels.
This patch fixes this:
- do nothing in case of EXT3_ERRORS_CONTINUE,
- set EXT3_MOUNT_ABORT and call journal_abort() in all other cases
- panic() should be called after ext3_commit_super() to save
 sb marked as EXT3_ERROR_FS
