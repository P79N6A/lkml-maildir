This definitely sounds sane, but...
Do you need a full struct device in struct gendisk? The device 
information, like the driver, power state, etc are redundant with the 
struct device in the (IDE, SCSI) drive structure. The generic disk 
structure doesn't follow the same semantics as a device structure. 
But, there are common fields and interfaces that struct gendisk (and 
several other objects) can benefit from. This is what I was getting at 
yesterday with replacing the struct device in hd_struct with just a struct 
driver_dir_entry. That's of course not enough, but something like: 
struct sys_object {
	struct list_head entry;	/* entry in global list of this type */
	atomic_t refcount;
	u32 present;
	struct driver_dir_entry dir;
	void (*release) (struct sys_object *);
};
We'd wind up with something similar to what you described before, though a 
little more generic:
alloc_disk() - initialize object. 
release_disk() - free object via ->release()
get_disk()/put_disk() - get()/put() on generic object. 
Then, the one thing that really integrates into the driver model: Wrap
add_disk() and del_gendisk() into ->add_device() and ->remove_device()  
of disk_devclass.
disk_devclass is initialized and added to the tree in 
drivers/block/genhd.c::device_init(). Once a driver is bound a device, it 
is added to the class the driver belongs to, which calls struct 
device_class::add_device(), with a pointer to the struct device of the 
drive. 
The other huge benefits of having a generic object like this are:
- all the current driver model objects can share them, along with the code 
  to operate on them. 
- driverfs can easily be taught about them, making reference counting 
  easier.
- The glue layers for adding driverfs support for different object types 
  becomes quite a bit less.
