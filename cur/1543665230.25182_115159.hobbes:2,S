But that's not exactly what you're doing - you're replacing one 
(very small) problem with another (very real) problem, the breakage 
of people's patches. Fixing up patches because of spelling
errors is a total waste of developer's time.

Breaking the build is indeed a low probability (assuming you compile
test your tree). Breaking other people's patches is a high probablility.
