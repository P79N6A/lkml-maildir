Well, I don't really need to read jiffies anymore.  My SYSRQ
patch fixes SYSRQ by adding code which is activated by echoing 2
into the proc sysrq file instead.  The code works regardless of
what keyboard you have, but SYSRQ works slightly differently on
keyboards when using my "2" method because it doesn't matter if
you let go of the SYSRQ key, so long as you hold ALT down.
Again, it only does this if you echo 2 into /proc..sysrq

I had it only track SYSRQ presses, however once in a while the
jiffy count would be one higher for the break event than the make
event, indicating that the counter is counting ok, just the
events are happening faster than a single jiffy.  It isn't hard
to believe that the keyboard sends scancodes at a rate faster
than the jiffy clock.  I mean its only 100Hz which isn't really
that fast IMHO.

I have not explicitly tested it.  It would be rather impossible
to generate info for other keys because other keys generate a
make code, and don't generate a break code until you let
go.  Unless you're Bruce Jenner, or my friend Dave who has an
amazingly fast Nintendo trigger finger, you're likely going to
take several ms between make and break on any key.
If you are truely interested in knowing the time delays, I would
gladly make a quick hack to the keyboard code to do just
that.  I'll bet that reading the jiffy timer is fine, and that
pressing and releasing a key manually will generate a difference
of several jiffies.  If the keyboard sends multiple events in
between the time the jiffy counter rolls from one value to the
next however, all that shows is that the jiffy counter is not a
good candidate for an event counter for the given hardware (in
this case the keyboard).
I ditched it.

Yep.  I did that to see if it just always displayed the same

Ahh, I see where you're heading.  If the make/break are received
and the jiffy count does not increment, then I can assume that it
is a broken keyboard SYSRQ key.  But it does increment by one
once in a while, so I'd have to allow for a difference of one
jiffy.  That *MIGHT* work, and wouldn't affect other keys
whatsoever if the code is only inside the if block which tests
for SYSRQ (which it is), however different keyboards may respond
differently, and it would make the timing code dependant on the
jiffy clock's frequency.  If sometime later HZ changes to 1024,
then the code will fail.
[SNIP]

That is an interesting analasis, however, the code which is
timing anything at all, is ONLY timing the make and break of
SYSRQ.  Timing any other keys is meaningless - at least for what
I was trying to fix.  The ONLY keycode in which the make/break
time matters is SYSRQ, so typing 400 wpm doesn't matter because
you certainly aren't typing 400wpm using the SYSRQ key
alone.  ;o)
So what it really boils down to is:  Is someone likely to press
SYSRQ and release it in less than 2 jiffies on a normal
non-broken keyboard?  Even if they did, it would cause no
harm.  If someone pressed SYSRQ that fast, then there is no way
that they'd press an actual SYSRQ key to do something in that
time too, and so everything would work no matter what.

But you're complicating the fact of what it is I'm trying to
do.  You're timing every key - I don't know why.  I was only
interested in timing the SYSRQ key to determine a threshold value
for a keyboard generated make/break pair on SYSRQ only.

Right, but I don't consider that a good reason to change the
default jiffies just to fix a SYSRQ problem on broken keyboards.  
Especially not, because it may expose problems in the kernel or
userland apps that expect HZ=100.  Sure the apps should likely be
fixed to be HZ independant, but I'm not going to overly
complicate things in such a wild way just to have SYSRQ working
(which it now does work with my existing patch I might add).

Well said!  I found an alternate fix though.  ;o)  I'll just keep
having fun replying to the rest of the message though.  It is
interesting reading the ideas anyways!  It is making me think of
some other cool things to do too.  ;o)

Then someone else can implement a fix for the other broken keys
if they have them.  It doesn't make much sense to me to try and
fix a problem that in fact may not exist at all.  I finally fixed
SYSRQ for me, and it does not in any way affect any other
keypresses except itself and the ALT break code which is
automaticly there if SYSRQ was received, so it just works.  ;o)

Perhaps I've missed your point, but perhaps you've missed the
problem I'm trying to solve.  It may well be possible to solve it
in another manner, however here is the problem and solution:
Problem:  I set out to fix SYSRQ to work on my keyboard.
Goals:
	1) Fix SYSRQ to work with my keyboard.
	2) It *MUST* *NOT* alter the current expected behavior
	   for anybody, or interfere with keyboard handling at
	   all.
	3) It *MUST* be a minimal patch, preferably contained
	   within the existing CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ defines.
Options:
	1) Have the code autodetect the broken keyboard and
	   adjust to suit.
My attempt to time things was an attempt to implement option
number 1, however I learned that it is not possible without
making drastic changes to kernel defines, or adding other code
that isn't needed for anything else, and cannot be justified just
for the purpose of fixing a DEVELOPERS "hack" feature used by 1
in 100000 people using the kernel, and of which maybe 1 in 10000
have the bug.  So option 1 was ditched.
Goal 1, 2, and 3 were met however, and unless I get a bug report
on it sometime in the next week or so, I'll assume that it works
just as good for everyone else, as it does for me.  Then I'll
take out the debugging printk's and port it to 2.3.x, and send it
to Alan, etc..

Ahh!  This is EXACTLY the type of discussion I wanted to see!  It
helps to cover all possible scenarios.  I have indeed written
down some "whatif" charts, and tried to cover the situations so
that SYSRQ only happens when it is supposed to, and any other
mistakes, etc just get ignored gracefully.  So far it works fine,
but there may be times when it doesn't, so lets see.

Evidently you haven't looked at my patch.  ;o)  My patch does NOT
in ANY WAY effect the sequence of keys the keyboard handler
sees.  ALL of my changes are inside the code block which starts
with:
if (keycode == SYSRQ_KEY)
So if you never press SYSRQ, my code never EVER gets touched at
all.  If you do press SYSRQ, it works the same way that it always
did - both on fixed and broken keyboards (when
sysrq_enabled=1).  The only person who would turn on
sysrq_enabled=2, would be someone like me, who has a broken
keyboard.
With sysrq_enabled=1, what happens is:  The existing 2.2.14 code
toggles the variable sysrq_pressed whenever the make OR break
code is received for SYSRQ.
With the sysrq_enabled=2, what happens is, my code ONLY toggles
(sysrq_pressed = !up_flag), when the SYSRQ *MAKE* code is
received.  When the BREAK code is received, it ignores it by just
doing a "return" instead.  This keeps sysrq_pressed in an
activated state, as if the key were pressed and held down.  Then
of course we need a way to get OUT of SYSRQ mode, and that
happens when the ALT key's break code is received.  The code
special cases everything so that any ALT key's break code works
to clear sysrq_pressed.
Any key pressed while sysrq_pressed is active, will be sent to
the sysrq handler for processing.  If the key is not valid, then
the same thing will occur as if you pressed a bad key on a
working keyboard without my patch.
Please look at the patch to see exactly what it is doing
first.  If after looking at it, you see some scenario that could
cause REAL TROUBLE to occur, then I certainly want to fix
it.  The current patch more or less makes the SYSRQ key work like
a sticky key as long as ALT is held down.  It ONLY does that
however if you enable it via proc first with:
echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
> > The solution works and works well.
>
>Does that include the above scenario?
The above scenario is not possible.  My patch doesn't change
the order of keyboard make/break events hitting the code.  Here 
is what happens with sysrq_enabled set to 1.

The above is how things happen on the existing kernel with ANY
keyboard.  With my patch, with sysrq_enabled set to 1, the above
scenario is 100% identical.
Here is what happens when sysrq_enabled is set to 2 with my patch
applied:
ALT MAKE
SYSRQ MAKE      - enable's sysrq_pressed, now listening
                  for special keypress
SYSRQ BREAK     - we ignore this code and return, thus keeping
		  the value of sysrq_pressed the same, as if
		  SYSRQ's BREAK code were never received.
SCRLK MAKE      - processed the same as if you pressed it without
		  my patch applied.
SCRLK BREAK     - same as make code
ALT BREAK       - toggles sysrq_pressed *ONLY* if sysrq_pressed
		  is active, then processed normally afterwards.
I haven't been able to trigger any bad behavior and I've tried to
do so a LOT on both a working keyboard and a broken one.

No, you don't understand.  It DOES NOT change the way SYSRQ works
AT ALL IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER on broken OR fixed keyboards if you
enable SYSRQ with:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
which is the recommended way to do so.
You need to use "echo 2" to enable my behavior, and if you do,
ALL keyboards will work with SYSRQ, however SYSRQ will act like a
sticky key until ALT is released.  It works, and doesn't seem to
have any flaws so far.
No amount of bashing I've given it in the last day, with either
keyboard (good or bad) has caused any undesireable behaviour or
problems.  If someone else has problems actually USING the patch,
I want to know what/how/why, and any comments they have.
If someone wants to analyze possible problem scenarios, that is
good too, but only if they've looked at my actual code and
understand it first.  Prefereably, having also tried it for real.

The problem occurs ONLY because of the way the current SYSRQ code
works.  Since the SYSRQ code does not handle other keys such as
shift, then the problem can never EVER occur with them.  Please
look at the keyboard.c file and see how SYSRQ works, and WHY it
does not work on keyboards that send both make and break
simultaneously.  It is isolated issue direct with the SYSRQ key.

Which is why I would only accept a solution that was no more than
a few small lines of code MAX.  My patch, aside from comments -
which can be reduced if necessary, or removed if necessary, only
adds 8 lines of code, of which 4 lines are printk's for debugging
the patch.  Once the printk's are removed, the patch adds only 4
lines of code to the actual code.  Definitely not bloat - by far.

Well, as I say, it is 4 lines of code, which probably results in
a kernel that is 20 bytes larger if you choose SYSRQ.  Hardly
bloat.  I'd certainly be willing to make it a config feature,
however I think that would bloat the size of the config code
unnecessarily to save 20 bytes of binary in the kernel image when
using SYSRQ.
Right now, I'm ONLY interested in if the thing WORKS for
everyone.  Once that is done, THEN I'll consider sending it in
for general inclusion.  If it is rejected, I'll try to change it
in whatever way recommended if it will be accepted.  If it is
flat out rejected, then that is ok too for whatever reason.  I'm
going to at least try nonetheless.

Since the problem is solved, discussing the timing of keys is no
longer really relevant, so I'm going to chop it off here.  Your
comments are definitely correct however, and if I'd not found
another way of doing the fix, I'd possibly have tried out some
more stuff WRT timing issues.

Perhaps he will, but I hope not.  I'm NOT adding anything at all
to proc.  Just allowing something that is there allready to take
on another value not previously used (2).

Yes, I found that out as well.  My initial solutions all added a
bunch of code.  I wasn't happy with this, and would NEVER have
sent it in.  My existing solution adds 4 lines of code to the
keyboard.c file in a non-bloat and non-intrusive manner.
Only one thing though:  The patch that I sent out the other day,
was not the one I intended to... it was the first patch.  ;o(
My second patch, is the one I intended to send out.  Both patches
work, but the first patch makes the keyboard beep and you need to
switch VC's back and forth.  The second patch works seemingly
without a glitch.
If it is not accepted, I can live with it.  Sure is annoying not
being able to do SYSRQ without a patched kernel though, and I
really don't see any other way of fixing it other than right
inside the handle_scancode() function where SYSRQ is checked for.
Perhaps someone else can come up with a more elegant
solution..  I dunno..
Anyways, take care!
