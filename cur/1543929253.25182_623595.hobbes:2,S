Well, I've rebuilt the kernel with HID_DEBUG, DEBUG_FS, and USBMON.
And I've written a nifty script to make usbmon tracing effortless for this.
And now I'm waiting.. things are currently behaving perfectly.
Go figure.  It did seem to arrive in bursts before.

I'll track it down here and post again next time it starts happening.
Mmmm...
