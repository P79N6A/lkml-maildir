You make an interesting point. Have you checked if an inb_p() on this hardware
could unlock the latch when reading the first byte ? It may also be one cause
of time jumps if the counter is just about to wrap when it's being read, and
gets unlocked by an out to port 0x80 (the "_p").

Or perhaps it will be time to change port 0x80 to something else, that no
chipset will use. I've seen 0xED in a bios somewhere, but I don't remember
where.
