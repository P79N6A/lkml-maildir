Not much help debugging it, but I can say I've seen the same
thing numerous times on kernels 2.4.[4678] and various -ac
patches (as well as stock kernels). I've tried disabling certain
"newer" features (kernel pppoe for example) and upgrading some
of the other software on the box that was suspect due to it being
relatively active at the time of crash (samba, X, etc.) but have
had no luck yet. I wish I had a serial console to plug in to
see if that turned anything up, because SysRQ doesn't even respond.
On a lighter note, I'm currently running 2.4.8-ac2, and while
the problem isn't gone, it does seem to be less frequent, so I'm
thinking I might try moving to a later 2.4.8-ac or even 2.4.9 if
I get the time this weekend.
I didn't see this at all on 2.4.2, which I ran for a couple
months, so my guess is it's related to something that changed
in 2.4.3 (which I skipped) and 2.4.4, but I haven't had the time
to even consider an exhaustive search through all those possibilities.
Good luck, and let me know if you find anything...
