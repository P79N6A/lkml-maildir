Isn't that possible like this?
  (a) Up to #CPUs page directories (only the pgds) per mm_struct. 
      The only difference is this special kernel page, which lives in
      a single pgd entry.
  (b) When switching between different threads on the same processor
      (and only then), invlpg the page.
  (c) To get really cocky I think you can use #CPUs/2 pgds and some
      dubious segment tricks.
A fixed mapping that can provide even one thread-specific pointer would
be very cool.
