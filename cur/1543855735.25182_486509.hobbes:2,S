Loading (then unloading) e100.ko fails the first few times (i.e. the 
driver claims one of the EEPROMs is corrupted). Thereafter, sometimes it 
fails, other times it works. Sounds like a race, no?
$ cat load_unload
: > /var/log/kern.log
insmod e100.ko debug=16
sleep 1
cp /var/log/kern.log insmod_$I.txt
ip link > ip_link_$I.txt
sleep 2
rmmod e100
let "I=I+1"
(cf. attached compressed archive)

On an unrelated note, insmod_100.txt is truncated at the beginning, and 
insmod_110.txt is truncated in the middle (!!) cf. line 14. What would 
cause klogd to behave like that?
