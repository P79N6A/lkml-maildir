Subject: [PATCH] sched.h: increment TASK_COMM_LEN to 20 bytes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/23/275

Lets use 19+1 chars.  This helps display properly
kernel threads (e.g. SATA translation threads) which bear
the address of the STP/SATA bridge where the SATA disk is
connected. Those are 16+1 chars long.  Currently (15+1) the last
character is not displayed as it is used by the '\0'.
The array is 4 byte aligned so we add another 4 bytes to it.
