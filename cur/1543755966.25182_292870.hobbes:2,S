Right.  That's a fancy way of saying "cheating" ;)
But from the oprofile output it appears to me that there is plenty of CPU
capacity left over.  Maybe I'm misreading it due to oprofile adding in the
SMP factor (25% CPU on a 4-way means we've exhausted CPU capacity).

Probably so.
There are various tools in
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/ext3-tools.tar.gz
 which are
more useful than dd, btw.  `odread' and `odwrite' are usful for this sort
of thing.
