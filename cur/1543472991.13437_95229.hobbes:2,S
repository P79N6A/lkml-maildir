But I still have to edit it to change the compiler to use egcc. 
Would it be possible to define a single variable to choose the
compiler, so that I can pass a value on the command line? In the
Makefile there are 2 different variables for CC at the present time:
HOSTCC  	=egcc
HOSTCFLAGS	=-Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
CROSS_COMPILE 	=
AS	=$(CROSS_COMPILE)as
LD	=$(CROSS_COMPILE)ld
CC	=$(CROSS_COMPILE)egcc -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
CPP	=$(CC) -E
Would it be possible to change the CC line so as to read:
CC      =$(CROSS_COMPILE)$(HOSTCC) -D__KERNEL__ -I$(HPATH)
so that I could invoke the compilation as
HOSTCC=egcc make xconfig dep clean etc etc etc....
Thanks for your attention.
