I was using gcc-3.3.  I tried both -std=c99 and -std=gnu99, and gcc-3.3
didn't like the code either way, nor did it like it with no -std
option.  Gcc-3.2 compiles it perfectly happily though, so that is what
I am doing for now.
(I did have to hack some of the pre-definitions in check.c to make it
useful on PPC, e.g., I changed it to pre-define __ppc__ instead of
__i386__.)
Paul.
