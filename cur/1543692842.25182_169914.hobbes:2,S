I wish I could just write off programs like that, but if a program is
running, and doing legitimate system calls, and it stops running
(totally or usefully), I'd like to be sure that the kernel doesn't have
some unintended behaviour before I just pass on the program.
Particularly when OO is what allows lots of people to avoid running that
other operating system.

The vmstat sure didn't show a big increase in contenxt switches, but if
there's nothing elese wanting the CPU I would expect the render to be
what's running, and at the same speed as test5.
Suggestion: could you run 'top' in the text output mode to see if for
some reason the CPU is going to some odd process. The revised nice
handling can't make a user process lower priority than the idle loop or
something odd like that, can it?
