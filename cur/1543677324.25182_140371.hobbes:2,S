No need:
A single machine can support four displays, keyboards, and mice easily.  We
can use such machines as X servers for four people.  Each one can be connected
via Ethernet to the Linux supercomputer.  That way you get the cost advantages
of the multi-headed setup, with the scalability of the X server setup.  I think
you could scale to 64 or 128 users like that.
