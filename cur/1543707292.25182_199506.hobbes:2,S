It does that more by accident. I actually consider it an error that the
dependency of boolean symbol modifies how it does the selection (note that
the dependencies can be more than is immediately visible, e.g. from an
'if' or a 'menu' block), so I prefer if one want to limit the selection of
a boolean symbol to make this explicit (via an 'if' condition after the
selection).
bye, Roman
