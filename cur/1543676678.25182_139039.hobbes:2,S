Did you read the earlier posts? They are similar, and simplified because 
they don't need the level, since all suspend/resume is expected to happen 
with interrupts disabled. The semantics are obvious, the deviation 
trivial, and this thread a dead horse. 
Please present a case in which that will not work and I will change the
semantics.

Huh? Since when is everything that's not PCI a system device? Please read 
the documentation, esp. WRT system and platform devices.
