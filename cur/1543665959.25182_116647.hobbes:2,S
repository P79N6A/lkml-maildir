I've read most of it, and as far as I can see the problem is that one
drive is known to accept 256 sector commands and occasionally fail on
them.  Since that is obviously broken behavior, I don't see how it can
possibly even be suggested that we reduce the performance of possibly
every other hard disk in use[1] just to compensate for it.
[1] Note that the known broken disk is 700 MB one, so there probably
aren't many in use anyway.
John.
