Heh, the poor-man's udev worked for someone :)

The problem is in your udev rules.  You are running something in them
that is opening up your ide-cs device, which causes another hotplug
event to happen, which causes udev to run again, and so on.
I suggest you take this up with your distro, they are the ones
responsible for this problem.
Hint, gentoo, debian, and suse don't have this problem, so you might
want to look at their rules files for how to work around this.  Look for
this line:
# skip accessing removable ide devices, cause the ide drivers are horrible broken
and add the rules after it.

I think the presence of the node causes udev to not generate another
one, which keeps the rule from being run and another hotplug event from
being generated.
Hope this helps,
