So far you have mainly used this as an opportunity to whine over Red
Hat.

What real problem? The issue of C++ was well explain, gcc 2.95 is
broken beyond repair and until we get the new 3.0 API/ABI set in stone
there isn't any real reason to even try to be compatible. WRT the
glibc-2.2 shipping then this is not going to be an issue unless there
is going to be an ABI change between now and the final 2.2 release and
then thats going to be up to RH to solve that problem - Ulrich clearly
stated that he wasn't going to take RHAT's distribution people into
consideration if there was a need for an ABI change it would
happen. Thus in this case all there is for people to scream about is
*if* an ABI change happens and RHAT doesn't deal with it properly.

You rudely insult quite a few free software developers claiming
they've put their souls up for sale and they'll budge for coorporate
pressure. So far you have proven none of those claims - which makes it
nothing but insulting.

Everybody agrees that glibc-2.2 is the target to switch to as soon as
possible, whats your problem with that? It is the future standard.

Yes gcc-2.7.2.3, 2.8.1 (eeek) or egcs-1.1.2 - gcc-2.95 is too broken
to even consider.

Oh rubbish, you have the choice between egcs-1.1.2 or gcc-2.96-cvs,
you pick the latter if you want to consider reasonable C++ support and
want the future API.
