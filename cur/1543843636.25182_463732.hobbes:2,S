This thread has already discuss the merits of static instrumentation 
when it comes to the performance impacts.  The key is now to find a 
balance between static vs dynamic probes.  While it is true that static 
probes will provide less overhead compared to dynamic probes, some probe 
point will see less of an impact in measurable performance impact of 
dynamic probes due to the nature of the probe.  We need to find what 
that balance is.
To some people performance is the #1 priority and to other it is 
flexibility.  I would like to come up with a list of those probe point 
that absolutely need to be inserted into the code statically.  Those 
that are not absolutely critical to have statically should be 
implemented dynamically.
