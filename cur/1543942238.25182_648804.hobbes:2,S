I have no strong preference - I do not like the naming of
__FINIT but maybe thats just me and I have no better name right now.

I have not investigated this. My attention were due to section mismatch
warnings pointing to section names I could not find in the code.
When I did an objdump of vmlinux the funny section names were gone
so I expected ld had recognized them and merged them somehow - but I 
did not look closer as my focus was to get rid of them anyway.
I also did a quick skimming of info ld - but no luck.
