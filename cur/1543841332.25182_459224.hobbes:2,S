From looking at my current boot logs it appears that initramfs is setup right
after the CPUs are brought up, so it should be available before any drivers
are initialized and they should be able to get to their firmware in the
initramfs as long as it's in the right path in the image.  I don't have any
drivers that require external firmware to test that theory out with though.
