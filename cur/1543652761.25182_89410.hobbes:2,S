Patch looks pretty good to me... seems like the obvious (and useful) 
cleanup.
You should increase DEVICE_NAME_SIZE in include/linux/device.h from 80 
to 90, though.  I assume you don't want to take the other option, which 
is to audit every use and all the id strings to make sure they're short 
enough.  In fact, IIRC, device name increased in size due to some really 
long PCI names, so I think '90' will wind up the preferred value in any 
case.
