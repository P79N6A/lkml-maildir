	It really would be nice if you knew what you were talking about.
The shadow password file also stores one-way hashes.  The smbpassword file
(assuming that's what you are talking about) can be just as secure as the
shadow file (readable only to root), so how is it "more sensitive"?

	And your choice is?  All you have are hashes.  You can not reverse
the hashing.  If you don't have the NTLM hashes, you can not generate them
from the one-way hashes in the shadow file or anywhere else.  And without
them you are not going to be able to authenticate against the NTLM challenge
response system.  They don't give you a password to validate.  You have to
have the NTLM hashes that the client is going to regenerate as part of the
challenge response protocol.  That protocol could still use some hardening
even in NTLM SSP v2, but the hashes themselves are pretty tough nuts to
crack.  Just as tough as the MD5 hashes in the shadow file (if you bothered
to enable MD5 hashes - if you didn't, well, what can I say).
