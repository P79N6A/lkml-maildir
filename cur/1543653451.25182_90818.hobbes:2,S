I will not enable epoll fds to be stored inside another epoll fd. With
limited numbers of fds poll scales good, and if you need to create a
priority hierarchy, you can use a small poll set of epoll fds. This is a
very corner case and I'm not willing to screw up the to to handle
something that made 0.1% of users are going to do. It _can_ be done in
other ways.
