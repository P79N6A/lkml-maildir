Hi,
I realized after a crash, if in /etc/fstab the fsck is 
on, it takes about 45-50 minutes to check 2x18Go scsi in raidsoft.
So I put 0 in /etc/fstab, and it mounts /dev/md0 direclty (which
is no good, I agree). But after I go to init 1 and make all
folks handly (unmount, fsck, reboot) and it takes 6 minutes.
any idea why it is so long ?
