Yes, I agree that it is ugly.  And on top of that, we are holding the timer lock 
which is an irq version.  As to the need to hold it through the bump, we want 
the timers expire time to match what it should given the clock setting we are 
using, otherwise, the clock_was_set() code could come through and change that 
under us.  (Not a pretty sight.)
Now, the bounding on the while, :( it depends on a) the interval and b) how far 
the clock was moved.  The shorter the interval or the longer the time interval, 
the more we loop.  I suppose the best thing to do here is an div, but will, most 
of the time, take longer.

Oh, shit.  And I thought I had the cat locked away in the back room. ;)

Ok.

Eh?  Seems funny that we have a definition for mutex (DECLARE_MUTEX) and don't 
have the defines to use them.  But, ok.
