Yes.  You should use a persistent name for your network devices to

That being said, I think we need to reverse the order of this patch,
keeping the current scheme as default, and allowing it to be overridden
on the command line for those few machines where it matters to be
compatible with the old, 2.4 ordering scheme.
Matt, care to rework the patch in this manner?
