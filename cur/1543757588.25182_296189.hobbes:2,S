Hi Vise People,
<GH1N2J3JKL - this helps, me to find answers - please keep line>
ASUS P2B-DS board seems NOT work very well with default kernel in FED
Core 3.  smp-kernel hangs booting at various stages. I am goig to try
2.6.10 today. non-smp-kernel boots fine. This is my first time I try to
test with smp-kernels so I don't know what I could try. Could someone
give me some directions what to test?
If someone already know this is doomed motherboard might say so I
wouldn't waste time with it. Thanks.
Best Regards
Kari Laine
