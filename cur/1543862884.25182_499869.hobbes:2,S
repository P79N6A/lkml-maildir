Thereby preventing the action of <break> (which may be to cause a SAK
event, which would be rather important on a console to ensure that
you're really logging in rather than typing your password into another
users program which just looks like a login program.)
Note that the sequence for sysrq is:
(non-break characters or nothing) <break> <sysrq-char>
