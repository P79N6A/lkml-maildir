Perhaps this has been asked for a million times, but I'm new to 
perfctrs...
Is there any tool available to profile a program based on this ?
I have seen perfex, but that gives total counts. I would like something
like gprof... We are now optimizing some software and I would like to
make my colleagues leave Windows (they use Intel's VTune) and go to
Linux.
Or at least compare the same kind of things between VTune on win and
'something' in Linux that also uses the counters. They don't seem to
trust gprof. And, looking at the results, I'm beginning to untrust
VTune...
TIA
