Right. Could we get more helpful message here? 'Filesystem check on
next boot on AC power'? Or maybe keep counting, and when we reach 2x
mount-count-limit, force a fsck, battery power or not?

I guess openembedded people should make this default on zauruses...

I'll just remember to do it manually, I guess. 
But here's what I've got:
oot@spitz:/home/pavel# fsck.ext2 -f /dev/hda3
e2fsck 1.38 (30-Jun-2005)
Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
Inode 371989 has illegal block(s).  Clear<y>? yes
Illegal block #2 (134217728) in inode 371989.  CLEARED.
Pass 2: Checking directory structure
i_file_acl for inode 371988 (/home/root/misc/zaurus/smail) is 131072,
should be zero.
Clear<y>? yes
Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
Pass 4: Checking reference counts
Pass 5: Checking group summary information
Block bitmap differences:  -339972 +471044
Fix<y>? yes
Free blocks count wrong for group #10 (13882, counted=13883).
Fix<y>? yes
...kernel 2.6.16-preempt (on zaurus). Filesystem should have been clean -- I was
using it till crash for half a year, but that's what journal is for,
right? ...But I guess this is almost impossible to debug?
