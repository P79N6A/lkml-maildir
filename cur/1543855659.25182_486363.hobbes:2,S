Hmmm. Could you send me your dmesg? Also what frequency is your cpu?
Also does booting w/ "noapic" change the behavior?

I think you mean "current_clocksource" there...

Yea, its likely the generic timekeeping changes for i386. Previously
(pre-2.6.18) it probably defaulted to the acpi pm timer and was fine.
The new code is a bit more aggressive in trying to use the TSC.
As a short term workaround, you can put "clocksource=acpi_pm" on your
grub line and that will force the clocksource at boot.
