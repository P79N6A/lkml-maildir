The formal spec is something like 230 V ± 10%.  The value 230 V was
chosed exactly because both the 220 V and 240 V mains systems could
comply without change as long as they regulated their voltages more
tightly than the spec required.  Since the main reason for the fairly
wide error bar isn't variation in generation, but remote locations
with long transmission lines (how much voltage drop between the
nearest and the farthest tap?), this is mostly a non-issue.  It might
have required adjusting transformers in a few places that serve just
such remote locations, or the installation of buck/boost transformers
in a few places.  In urban areas it should have made absolutely no
difference.  Maybe they'll start using 230 V for new installations,
but somehow I doubt it.
