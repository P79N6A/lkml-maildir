That's what is currently done.  There are two filesystem formats, big  
endian (donated by Squashfs magic of 'sqsh') and little endian  
(denoted by Squashfs magic of 'hsqs').  The kernel code detects the  
filesystem endianness and swaps if necessary.

That's what is currently done.  The data is swapped if necessary at  
unpack time.  Afterwards no further swapping is performed.
