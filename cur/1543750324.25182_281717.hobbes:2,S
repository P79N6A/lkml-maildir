Hello,
We know, VQs are used in Gred to offer different schedulers, in order to make
clear what the 
VQs are, I have read the sch_gred.c in net/sched/. In the function gred_enqueue(),
at first it will 
find the VQ(q) according to the lower four bits of the skb->tc_index, then some
parameters of the
q is modified, such as q->packetsin and q->bytesin. At last the packet was put
into the  physical
Queue using __skb_queue_tail(). When dequeue the packet, only the function
__skb_dequeue()
is called, and the VQ parameters are modified. Then the packets from all VQS will
enter and 
store in the physical queue (sch->q), and be dequeued from there. HOW does the
Gred schedule
packets of differnet priorities?
Thanks,
-
