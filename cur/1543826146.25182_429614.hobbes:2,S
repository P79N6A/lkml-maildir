I was thinking of it from the resource management POV.

No.  PAGG just provides the infrastructure for grouping tasks together 
and adding any extra per task data that you may require.  Of course, you 
can provide your own per group data as well.  It's then up to the author 
of the module utilizing PAGG to implement whatever group specific 
functionality that they want.

I think that it can especially now that load balancing takes "nice" into 
account.  Without the smpnice patches it would have been difficult due 
to the effects of "soft" affinity tending to undermine "nice"'s 
functionality.

It's simple but there's a non trivial amount of work required.
I know from previous discussion with CKRM folks that you find the idea 
of providing a number of small independent capabilities that enable more 
complex capabilities to be built on top of them difficult to come to 
terms with.  But that doesn't mean it won't work.  It has the advantage 
of being less intrusive and causing less angst to those users who don't 
want sophisticated resource control.
