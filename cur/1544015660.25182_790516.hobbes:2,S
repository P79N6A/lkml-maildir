Correct, albeit under emulation, such as QEMU. Obviously the target
architecture, such as an embedded MIPSEL device with only 8MB of flash
and 64MB of RAM, is not going to (particularly well) re-compile its
entire environment, QEMU allows it nicely with distcc at a reasonable
speed. (Albeit there is no distconfigure, but that's entirely an
unrelated tanget of muck and despair and rants against configure, but
we're not going there...)
