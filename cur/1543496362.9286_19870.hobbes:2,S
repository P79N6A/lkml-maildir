The "system clock" is a collection of variables in the kernel, 
maintained by the kernel. I hope you agree. As The BIOS starts before 
Linux is in RAM, the BIOS can't set the time for Linux. I hope you 
also agree.

<soapbox>
Well, Microsoft does not know about timezones, so why should a BIOS 
care to allow setting one? WE can do little about that, but i wonder 
why you can read the serial number of your CPU via DMI, and you can 
read the temperature of your mainboard, but you can't read the 
timezone.
Maybe the BIOS developers are captured in a darf cellar and they 
don't ever meet reality.

In cae you want to look at it: LINUX reads the time from the hardware 
(=RTC) during boot. That's why the time is set.

Agreed.

DST makes things harder: How can you know (after powering the system 
up) whether the RTC is already time-corrected or not?

BTW: Why is the utility named "hwclock" and the option "--hctosys"? I 
always wished for "--hwtosys", or maybe call the program "hclock".

I think you convinced me to do nothing about the issue. So let just 
the sun shine on my nose.
