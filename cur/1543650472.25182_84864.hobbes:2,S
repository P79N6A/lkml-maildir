Erm, really ? 
> o Post-freeze  Add hardware sensors drivers  (lm_sensors team)
Something else I took a look at in the last few days was the ECC
drivers. These are also zero impact, and could go in after the freeze
(assuming the authors want them merged). They could do with a small
amount of cleanup, but otherwise look ok.

I've jiggled a bunch of this (Randy didnt have time to play here)
around as much as its probably going to be for 2.6. It's in -dj,
has been sent for -ac, and will likely go to Linus post-freeze
as its all cleanups, and one-liners.
