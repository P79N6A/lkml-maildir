Since 2.6.0-test6 Linux just hangs from time to time. Hardware in
question is a omnibook (laptop (hp omnibook 6100, P3m, i830m chipset).
Frequency is about twice a day.
The system hangs regardless of the current workload, sysrg is still
working, but the computer is not ping-able. This problem could be
verified with 2.6.0-test7-bk[3-5], disabling power managment in 
2.6.0-test7-bk5 didn't kills it of.
There are no log messages concerning the bug.
I'm now trying 2.6.0-test7-bk6 without power-management.
Any suggestions?
