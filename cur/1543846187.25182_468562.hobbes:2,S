My thoughts on this was to make the new license backwards compatible 
with GPL2 so that there wouldn't be a change. The main feature of a new 
name is to lose RMS control. From what I can see the FSF is an cult that 
worships RMS who has become a little full of himself and has abandoned 
logic and scientific process. He has no concept of IP at all and wants 
to put GNU in front of everything as if he had personally invented all 
software. He's more like a cat spraying everything to mark it with his 
scent than someone who is contributing in a meaningful way.
It's late - and I'm on a rant. I suppose it's a metaphor for a divorce 
from RMS. Just getting tired of his bullshit.
