The technical accreditation would have to be based on the existing  
expertise of the kernel maintainers.
Administration handled by a new Independent not-for-profit body with  
initial funding from the bodies mentioned above.
On going funding provided by revenue from anyone who wants to use the  
logo without having provided an open-source driver in 'payment'.

The accreditation, by kernel maintainers, would be based on the fact  
that the driver provides full support for the features of the hardware.

The purpose of the logo is to build customer demand for hardware  
which is accredited and therefore has the benefits of open source  
drivers which will be maintained.
Once the logo gains mind share there will be a competitive advantage  
for the OEMs who use it.
Therefore they will be willing to bear some costs.

As above.

The primary requiremnet to gain the logo is that there is an open  
source driver (merged in the kernel tree).
The logo allows people to tell the difference between OEMs who claim  
compatibility because they use ndiswrapper and those who actually  
have a proper kernel driver.

The solution depends on build the logo 'brand' so that different  
players in the linux world want to use it .
This will happen in the following manner:

With a logo a PC vendor such as Dell can stick the logo on their PCs  
if and only if every component in the machine is certified.  
(Including motherboard, on-board graphics, on-boad-sound, on-board  
raid etc. etc.)
This means you or I don't have to try to find out the exact machine  
specification from Dell and then individually check each part against  
the hardware database.
