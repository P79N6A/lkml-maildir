No.  Perl is the quintessential example of a program whose manpages are mostly
unusable simply because the documentation is too big for the `man' way of
accessing it.  If `man perl chop' worked, it would be OK, but it doesn't. An
indexed and hyperlinked manual is much more valuable for those kinds of
applications.

PS: the reason why TeXinfo is better than HTML in my world is that it allows
    better quality printout, and is much quicker to access (maybe it's because
    my browser is hopelessly more bloated than my info reader, but since my
    info reader is Emacs, that seems unlikely).  Also standard navigation
    shortcuts like "up" "next" "index" etc... are sorely lacking from HTML.
