In TFT displays, nontransmissive pixels consume more power than transmissive
pixels.  So a black background consumes more power than a white one. And
if you are using these ioctl's to blank the screen, it will default to
"normal blank" (if you don't set the vesa blanking mode first), which,
in vgacon or most of the fbdev's, will just turn the color palette to all
black.  So yes, you might be consuming more power with this method.
You're probably better off turning the brightness down, if you cannot turn
the backlight off.

PS: I don't know the resulting power consumption if you use the vesa
blanking modes (TIOCL_SETVESABLANK) to blank while leaving the backlight on.
