Hi,
Here is how I manage to hit this under 2.4.0-test11-pre6
1. mkfs an ext2 filesystem on a 36G disk
2. do a complex combination of data and metadata io on it by means
  of SPECsfs with LOADs high enough to run out of space
3. observe that both high and low memory are almost zero, i.e. about 2M
each (total is 6G)
now try to umount the filesystem and you'll get the above. I will try
test11-pre7 tomorrow...
Regards,
Tigran
