Subject: [PATCH] ioc4: automatically load sgiioc4 subordinate module
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/5/308

The main ioc4 driver which manages ownership of the SGI IOC4 PCI device
does not automatically load any of the ioc4 submodules (the sgiioc4 IDE
and ioc4_serial serial drivers) during PCI device probing.  This causes
problems when the root device is a DVD-ROM attached to the IOC4 IDE
interface (e.g. during system installation) as the sgiioc4 module
will not be loaded and thus the DVD-ROM device will not be available.
Modify ioc4 to always load the sgiioc4 IDE module if the board carrying
the IOC4 hardware actually implements the IDE interface (not all boards
bring this functionality off the IOC4 chip).
The use of a work procedure is necessary as request_module() cannot be
called from the device probe path as it eventually calls out to userspace.
