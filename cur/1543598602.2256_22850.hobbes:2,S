Yes, something was not right with my change.
I am trying to coax people into testing this (on top of -ac8):

Arjan said so too - I'll add them later just in case.
About (!timeout && !awd.done) - it's not going to be enough,
I think. I suspect that callback is not delivered at all
in some circumstances, or something really screwy like that.

I tried that first and it worked, but someone disagreed. Dunno...
