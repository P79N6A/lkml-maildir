I got someone to go into the BIOS setup (I am debugging this remotely) and
check the IDE/ATA related options.  The two relevant options were set
as follows:
  ATA/IDE Mode: <Native>    [ Choices: Legacy, Native ]
  Configure SATA as: <IDE>  [ Choices: IDE, RAID, AHCI ]
I had them change the "Configure SATA as" setting from "IDE" to "AHCI"
and then reboot into 2.6.22-rc2.  At this point things appear to be much
happier:

Therefore it seems that for whatever reason, the marvell_pata driver will
only find the Marvell PATA IDE controller if the *SATA* mode in the BIOS is
set to "AHCI".  It's somewhat counter-intuitive, but since AHCI is the
"correct" setting for SATA performance reasons it's probably not such a bad
thing.
So, thanks for all the suggestions; the problem appears solved.
