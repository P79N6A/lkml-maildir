Since then, have you changed:
a. the minimum required compiler version?
b. the clobbers on your switch_to asm?
If not, maybe you should.

That's only if gcc can find some place to
hide state which will contaminate another task.
Where could that be? Remember, arm works.
Also, glibc works, with per-thread errno:
/* Function to get address of global `errno' variable.  */
extern int *__errno_location (void) __THROW __attribute__ ((__const__));
/* Function to get address of global `h_errno' variable.  */
extern int *__h_errno_location (void) __THROW __attribute__ ((__const__));
