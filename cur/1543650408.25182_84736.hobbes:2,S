I was referring to these guys:
+#define list_first(head)	(((head)->next != (head)) ? (head)->next: (struct list_head *) 0)
+#define list_last(head)	(((head)->prev != (head)) ? (head)->prev: (struct list_head *) 0)
+#define list_next(pos, head)	(((pos)->next != (head)) ? (pos)->next: (struct list_head *) 0)
+#define list_prev(pos, head)	(((pos)->prev != (head)) ? (pos)->prev: (struct list_head *) 0)
if we are to add such things to list.h then lots of people need
to hum and hah over them first and ask questions like "why doesn't
it use list_empty?"  ;)
It would be better to recode epoll's list walks to use the existing
list accessors.
