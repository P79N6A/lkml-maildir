    Ok, then :)))) I'm testing /tmp over tmpfs right now. I don't
notice a great improvement in speed. I have plenty of RAM for my box,
and I think that, just as you said, when I'm compiling the contents
of the /tmp are always cached, no matter if using tmpfs or not.
    I'll try with higher loads and more processes trying to fill up
/tmp ;))
>See Documentation/filesystems/tmpfs.txt for more information.
    I'm afraid my 2.4.16 doesn't come with that file :((( My fault,
probably, although I don't remember touching the docs :???
    Thanks a lot for your help :)
