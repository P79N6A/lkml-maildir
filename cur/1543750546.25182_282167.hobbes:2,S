 I got bit by this error several times using slrn (news reader in s-lang).
If I press ^Z, slrn suspneds but spews error on 'fg'. Something about
IO error. It happened only om -mm kernels.
 I've saved strace output on -linus (where it worked), but beeing unable
to strace it on -mm [1] I deleted all logs and learned not to press ^Z.
[1] strace hung my system on -mm few times.
