Has anyone considered actually bumping up the priority of the task being 
killed so that it gets to run and free up its resources in a timely manner?
We've done some experimenting with actually putting it in SCHED_RR and 
it seems to help (in the case of other busy SCHED_RR tasks on the 
system).  Admittedly we have an older kernel, so behaviour may be 
different now.
