 struct file* - that'd explain why you have to go through
 some hoops, using fcheck_files().

 added match_inode() after match_comm().  cut/paste job (my favourite
 way of programming).

 well... okay, i must be missing something.
 what's the disconnect between the task_list and the sockets (sk_buff)
 that makes that [not knowing which one will be woken up] relevant?
 so it's a socket: let's take an example - and i'm assuming for now
 that things like passing file descriptors over unix-domain-sockets
 between processes just ... doesn't happen, okay? :)
 apache.
 an executable named apache creates a TCP socket and binds to port 80,
 and let's assume it's the prefork model, so it binds to port 80 and
 then starts sharing that [as you say, with refs] between all the
 apache processes.
 in this instance, all the processes are going to be named "apache",
 yes?
 they'll all have the same inode number.
 under these circumstances, i don't honestly think it makes
 any difference as to whether one process named apache is
 waiting on the socket and another process also named apache
 (fired up from the same inode) gets woken up.
 i mean, _yes_ it would be a problem if there really were two
 apaches run from different configuration files [that bound to
 different port numbers - i do this all the time and then run
 *another* apache web server in a DMZ to do proxy redirects]
 under these circumstances the best you could hope to do to get
 some sort of separation would be to copy the apache binary
 e.g. have an apache2-8000 and an apache2-80, and apply a
 different set of rules to match each separate binary.
 
 _or_, is there something "odd" going on, that i've missed?

 well with a default rule of "deny"...
 what have i missed?  i no unnerstand!
 in match_inode, it's an "and" rule, i.e. _only_ tasks with
 the right dev+inode, and then _only_ those tasks with sockets
 matching the right one get through...
 and you'd only use this in combination with other "match" rules which
 get "and"ed in - e.g. match dev+inode _and_ match port 80 _and_ match
 TCP before jumping to "ACCEPT"...
 so if anything, you could end up being _too_ specific and end up
 falling through to the default "DENY" rule.
 which is the whole idea.
 
 or in the case of fireflier, falling through to the default "QUEUE"
 rule to trigger user intervention.

 *whew* that makes it a lot easier.
