So they relay heavily on the VFS, and are not self-contained B-).
A clean separation, by means of a complex API, does not mean they're
self-contained. If the API is small and simple, that's another matter.
Anyway, whenever an API changes, you're in trouble...

Really, 2.3.0 was devel only by name. No real changes went in it.
If you were at 90%, you needed realworld testing. You could not at the
same time change your code to follow early 2.3 changes (by assumption,
they broke your code). You had to choose. (You could do both things,
if you had infinite developer time, of course).

Agreed. That's the worst case (for both).
But let's think of how this could happen, in my schema
(ok, if it takes 3 years to you to finish your project, simply you can't
make it anyway, and you can only release it on "old" kernel. So i'm
assuming your project is somewhat near 6-9 months):
major changes happen at 2.2y+1.quite-early. This means at
2.2y-1.right-after-feature-freeze time. If you're at 50%, you can't make
it for 2.2y. 2.2y+1.quite-early breaks your code. You're completely
out of sync. The difference here is only in that:
1) you knew it before - you started your project late in 2.2y-1 life.
You should have delayed it in order to get in sync with 2.2y+1. This means
taking part in the initial discussion of what will change in 2.2y+1.
In my proposal, that's 1-2 months. Right now it can be 6+ months. (Think
you want to start it *now*, 4-6 months or more before the first 2.5).
2) since the time between two releases is half of what it is now, 
there are less 'major changes' in every initial devel release. So
it's easier for you to eventually modify your code to fit the changes.
Or, you have half the chance your code will be affected by the 2.2y-1 ->
2.2y+1 move, which, in the long run, is the same.

If your goal is to release on 2.2 when Linus releases 2.4, you're right.

So? At the time 2.3.7 was out, you had to choose. Change your code
to work on it, or go on testing on 2.2. At 60+%, you could only
go on on 2.2. At 10% it really doesn't matter if you have to redisign it.
What was the state of ReiserFS, RAID 0.90 at 2.3.7 time? (I really don't
know. I'm just wondering if they were too advanced to follow the 2.3 
changes...)
