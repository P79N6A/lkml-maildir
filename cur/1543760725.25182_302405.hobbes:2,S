You wanna give me a quick run-down on x86 of CPL and Ring levels?  It's
been bugging me.  I know they're there and have a basic idea that they
control what a context can do, don't know what CPL stands for, and
there's a visible gap in my knowledge.  I like to understand everything,
it makes things easier.

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
    wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
    new problems waiting out there.
