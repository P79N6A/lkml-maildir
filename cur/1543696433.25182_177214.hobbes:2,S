usually when I boot up it mount's the remote filesystems, now it just
failed, and I tryed to ping lan/internet IP's they failed. And I noticed
that none of my cards were working. this is the output of lspci for the
card that works without forcedeth support in kernel and does not work if
forcedeth is enabled: 
01:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.
RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)
That's the main card that I use for lan/internet. ifconfig in the other
hand told me that I had two working cards. first on had ip 192.168.0.2
(that's right) and the new card had 192.168.1.1.
