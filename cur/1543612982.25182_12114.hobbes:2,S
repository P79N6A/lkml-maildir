Got a problem usb subsystem......
it's not seeing anything past the root hub....
when a device is connected the following error pops up....
USB device not accepting new address=2 (error=-110)
see for yourself here -->

what i find interesting is that no interrupts are being sent
see for yourself here --> 
http://quail.no-ip.com/interrupts.txt
i've removed just about all devices from the system.... and there is no 
change....
here's a list of the PCI bus......
http://quail.no-ip.com/lspci.txt
this problem appears on everything from 2.4.7 (RH7.2 kern)  to the 
latest and greatest (2.4.17-pre8) and probably earlier kernels as well....
the southbridge/usb controler is the VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C686b chip as you can see in 
http://quail.no-ip.com/lspci.txt
Let me know what else you need to make sence of this.......
