The irq_vector array name is a bit misleading.  It contains the vectors for 
each potential I/O APIC RTE.  The array needs to be at least the sum of all 
the RTEs in the system.  Summit PCI bridge chips have large I/O APICs (50 
RTEs), and a large system has up to 16 of them.  16*50 = 800.  Allocating 1k 
entries provides a pad for the future, and u8 doesn't cost much.
