There might be a better way of introducing modules, but I'm not sure it's
worth it. I think there's a problem with the way you suggested - it leaves
holes in the accessible memory range that are valid as far as the ELF
core-dump is concerned, but will cause a GPF in the kernel if you try and
access them. A better way would be to define each module's address space as a
separate section in the ELF core dump, but this makes the task more complex.
I'm not sure that the problem actually exists. It depends on whether the
module space begins immediately after "high_memory", and also what happens to
holes that remain after modules are unloaded.
