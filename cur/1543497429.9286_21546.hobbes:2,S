Subject: [PATCH][CFT] procfs cleanup - phase 1.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

	Folks, I'm putting the first version of procfs cleanup on
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/proc-patch-5.gz. Patch is against 2.3.4.
	Contents: 
*	/proc/net/* stuff mostly made dynamic. No more explicit struct
	proc_dir_entry in networking code.
*	Closed an oopsable bug in drivers/net/bmac.c - it forgot to
	release the /proc/net/bmac entry.
*	system-wide stuff in fs/proc/array.c made dynamic too and moved
	into fs/proc/proc_misc.c
*	fs/proc/net.c is gone. RIP.
*	proc_net_inode_operations is gone. It was an 100% equivalent of
	proc_file_inode_operations, which is default.
*	generic cleanup in fs/proc/* - things that should be static made
	static, etc.
	TODO:
*	pseudo-revoke() for /proc/<pid>/* stuff. That will kill most of
	permission checks. It will take an addition of new field (cyclic
	list head) to task_struct and switching to dynamic inumbers for
	procfs. Then we will be able to invalidate those inodes on exit(),
	so that even if a new process would get the same PID old inodes
	would stay dissociated from all processes.
*	Extermination of scanning the whole struct file list upon removal
	of procfs entry. Mostly the same technics as above.
*	Cleanup of situation with symlinks.
Patched kernel compiles, but the patch is almost untested. You are warned.
It is early alpha. With all usual implications. Help with testing is
welcome, indeed, just don't forget to mount a scratch monkey ;-)
							Cheers,
