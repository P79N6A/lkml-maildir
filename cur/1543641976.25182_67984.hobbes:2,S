invalidate_list, prune_icache, generic_delete_inode, and
generic_forget_inode all move the inode off of the inode hash before
setting the I_FREEING flag. So inodes in I_FREEING state can not be
found by find_inode.
Clear inode bugs when the inode is not I_FREEING, it then clears out the
inode and sets I_CLEAR. As a result, inodes in I_CLEAR state can not be
found by find_inode either.
So you can safely remove that test in ilookup.

I have no problem with the name. And coda_fid_to_inode could use
ilookup5 as well, as currently uses iget with the 'set_fail' trick.
