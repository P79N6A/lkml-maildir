well, some time ago i had an ne2k card in an SMP system as well, and found
this very problem. Disabling/enabling focus-cpu appeared to make a
difference, but later on i made experiments that show that in both cases
the hang happens. I spent a good deal of time trying to fix this problem,
but failed - so any fresh ideas are more than welcome.
