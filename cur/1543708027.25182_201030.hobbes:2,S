That would be so sweet (I hate that 2 hour long slocate run every
morning). It'd also help those of us who like our hd's to spin down,
but get confused by the zillions of lines output by laptop-mode (with
most of the changed "files" really coming from kjournald, etc) :)

You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull
his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles.  Do you
understand this?  And radio operates exactly the same way:  you send
signals here,  they receive them there.  The only difference is that
there is no cat.   -- Albie E. on radios.
