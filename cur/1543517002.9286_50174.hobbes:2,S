yes, we may have. But no such spec or requirement that I am aware of.
Returning EFAULT is being nice to the stupid user, but SIGSEGV'ing the
offender (e.g. if she overflows the stack) is not breaking any standards.

It is still done in several places. For example, have a look at
generic_file_read() in mm/filemap.c. It uses verify_area() at the top and
uses __copy_to_user() in the actual actor (file_read_actor).
