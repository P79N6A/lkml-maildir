Agreed. AFAICS, nfs_writepages should be quite OK, however writepage()
on its own _is_ problematic.
Look at the usage in write_one_page(), which calls directly down to
->writepage(), and then immediately does a wait_on_page_writeback().
How is the filesystem supposed to distinguish between the cases
"VM->writepage()", and "VM->writepages->mpage_writepages->writepage()"?
