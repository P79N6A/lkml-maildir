Can you please test the things that Francois asks you to test in the last 
comment?
That said, it does appear that the patch breaks things for some people, 
and the upsides seem very limited - only relevant when somebody tries to 
change the MAC address, which is not a very normal thing to do anyway.
So maybe reverting it is the right thing to do. Guennadi, can you confirm 
that it is commit a2b98a69 ("r8169: mac address change support") that 
breaks it, and that reverting just that one commit fixes things for you?
But please check the things that are suggested in the bugzilla entry 
first.
Francois? Jeff?
