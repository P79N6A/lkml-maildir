I was referring not to the current implementation but to an ideal
solution. Which is:
- use dm-crypt for swap and suspend
- overwrite mlocked regions on resume
- use per-boot session keys for the swap partition
- password protect the session key on suspend
This doesn't have great FIPS-secure deletion properties if the
attacker can steal the box after resume but while it's still running
(though it's not too bad). As we currently have no solution for
protecting the in-memory ssh-agent, as opposed to the one in the
suspend image, this attack vector is not all that important.
A much more likely vector is stealing the laptop while it's suspended.
And the encrypted swsusp patch has -zero- security here: it writes the
key in the header in the clear. It's rather odd that everyone's hung
up on the "box rooted after resume" attack and completely ignoring the
much more common "stole my laptop" attack.
