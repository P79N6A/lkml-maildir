I wouldn't think so. In fact, the Dxr3 is a re-badged RealMagic Hollywood
Plus. People on Windows platforms are actually using the Hollywood Plus
drivers with their Dxr3 cards because they are more reliable than Creative's
own Dxr3 drivers. There are also applications that let you get around region
coding and Macrovision with the H+ drivers.
