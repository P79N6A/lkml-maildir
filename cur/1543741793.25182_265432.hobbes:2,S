At one time Sun had the convention that things in /usr could be mounted 
ro on multiple machines. That worked, it predates Linux so Linux was the 
o/s which chose to go another way, and it covered the base things in a 
system.
That actually seems like a good way to split a networked environment, 
with /bin and /sbin having just enough to get the system up and mount 
/usr. I can't speak to why that is being done differently now.
I guess someone was nervous about mounting a local /usr/local on a 
(possibly) network mounted /usr and theu /opt, but that's a guess on my 
part as well.
