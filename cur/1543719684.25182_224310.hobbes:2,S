conf.c is already heavy overloaded and I'd rather add a separate querytool 
(which could also answer such burning questions as "what keeps that damn 
config symbol selected?"). IIRC the RH build first checks, whether the 
.config is valid, which can basically be done with "make silentoldconfig 
>& /dev/null" and printing the config symbols can be done with a separate 
tool. The Kconfig back end is a library to make this as simple as 
possible.
bye, Roman
