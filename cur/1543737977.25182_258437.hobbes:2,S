One can nest them, overlap them, and duplicate them ;)
For example, we could do the following:
 * Carve off CPUs 128-255 of a 256 CPU system in which
   to run various HPC jobs, requiring numbers of CPUs.
   This is named /dev/cpuset/hpcarena, and it is the really
   really exclusive and isolated sort of cpuset which can and
   does have its own scheduler domain, for a scheduler configuration
   that is tuned for running a mix of HPC jobs.  In this hpcarena
   also runs the per-cpu kernel threads that are pinned on CPUs
   128-255 (for _all_ tasks running on an exclusive cpuset
   must be in that cpuset or below).
 * The testing group gets half of this cpuset each weekend, in
   order to run a battery of tests: /dev/cpuset/hpcarena/testing.
   In this testing cpuset runs the following batch manager.
 * They run a home brew batch manager, which takes an input
   stream of test cases, carves off a small cpuset of the
   requested size, and runs that test case in that cpuset.
   This results in cpusets with names like:
   /dev/cpuset/hpcarena/testing/test123.  Our test123 is
   running in this cpuset.
 * Test123 here happens to be a test of the integrity of cpusets,
   so sets up a couple of cpusets to run two independent jobs,
   each a 2 CPU MPI job.  This results in the cpusets:
   /dev/cpuset/hpcarena/testing/test123/a and
   /dev/cpuset/hpcarena/testing/test123/b.  Our little
   MPI jobs 'a' and 'b' are running in these two cpusets.
We now have several nested cpusets, each overlapping its ancestors,
with tasks in each cpuset.
But only the top hpcarena cpuset has the exclusive ownership
with no form of overlap of everything in its subtree that
something like a distinct scheduler domain wants.
Hopefully the above is not what you meant by "little more than a
convenient way to group tasks."

The allocator is less stressed here by varied mems_allowed settings
than is the scheduler.  For in 99+% of the cases, the allocator is
dealing with a zonelist that has the local (currently executing)
first on the zonelist, and is dealing with a mems_allowed that allows
allocation on the local node.  So the allocator almost always succeeds
the first time it goes to see if the candidate page it has in hand
comes from a node allowed in current->mems_allowed.
