That has nothing to do with opening up ISDN development. The code already
has checksums and a signed block so you can check for the approved ELSA
driver for Germany. 
Active TA's need no L2 approval, just hardware approval as the D channel
is approved firmware not Linux
Finally most countries don't require such approvals. They recognized that
if feeding bad D channel data to an exchange caused failures they had a serious
security problem, especially as telco exchanges are right at the top of the
list of targets to hit just before a war, or before terrorist attacks
