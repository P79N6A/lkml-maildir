Any processor's cheap once it's got enough volume.  That's an effect not a 
cause.

You honestly think you can fit 142 PowerPC processors in a single 1U, air 
cooled?
Liquid air cooled, maybe...

LESS info?
Anybody wanna explain to me how it's possible to do branch prediction and 
speculative execution at compile time?  (Ala iTanium?)  I've heard a few 
attempts at an explanation, but nothing by anybody who was sober at the 
time...
You have less time to work, but you actually have MORE info about how it's 
actually running...

Okay, I'll bite.  Why couldn't a recompiler (like MetroWerks stuff) do the 
same static analysis on large code runs that GCC or some such could do if you 
give it -Oinsane and let it think for five minutes about each file?
Obviously the run-time version isn't going to spend the TIME to do that.  But 
claiming the information to perform these actions isn't available just 
because your variables no longer have english names...
