Thanks for pointing this out.

Yeah, at least I know what's the problem about :).

Hrm, too ugly (sadly as same as it was).
- not 32/64 bit compatible due to the ulong there.
- not exported to the world via include/linux (the reason why I removed it, they 
use something, which they know nothing about).
- I would rather see true firmware loading.
Would you be willing to test such a patch for point no. 3?
