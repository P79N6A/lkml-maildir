In 2.5.52 I broke sys_sync in subtle ways.  It seems that fsstress hits
sync() hard enough to trigger the failure.
sys_sync() will set mapping->dirtied_when non-zero against a clean inode. 
Later, in (say) __iget(), that inode gets moved over to inode_unused or
inode_in_use.  But because it has non-zero ->dirtied_when,
__mark_inode_dirty() thinks that the inode must still be on sb->s_dirty.
But it isn't.  It's on inode_in_use.  It (and its pages) never get written
out and the data gets thrown away on unmount.  Christoph has hit the same
thing.  I bet he was running fsstress too.  Sorry about that.
The below patch should fix it up - please test that.
So that's the umount problem.  I don't know why you're getting the fsx-linux
failure - I was unable to hit it in an hour's run of the above workload on
4-way.  Against both scsi and IDE.  So please look further into that, thanks.
