Right. But then "volatile" won't really matter either, unless you have 
some _ordering_ constraint, in which case "volatile" is not enough unless 
you're guaranteed to be single-threaded.
In other words, again, "volatile" is almost always the wrong thing to 
have, and just makes you _think_ your code is correct.
