I got my fieldbus-driver (bitbus) to work. I can hardly 
tell how good it felt when it moved its first packages!
Since it is heavyly based on skeleton.c it is gpl: You can get 
it at
ftp://ftp.andrive.de/pub/bitio.c.bz2
Of cause I would love to hear from people and get feedback on 
my coding style... :o)
But there are questions left:
I would like to direct packages to a given (raw) socket, depending on 
a 16-bit (short) number in the package which indicates the 
source of the package.
Right now I open a socket in userspace and bind it to the devive and 
give it the same protocol as I specified in the kernel-module. 
This way I can communicate with the devices on the bitbus.
But I want to do so from several processes. Right now all sockets 
could receive all packages. Of cause I can open several raw sockets 
with different file descriptors. Can I direct a package  to the userspace 
socket by specifing something like 
skb->sock=filedescriptor;
after I received the package
        skb->dev = dev;
        skb->len = pkt_len.cpu_order;
        skb->mac.raw=skb->data;
        skb->protocol=htons(MCAT_PROTO);
        skb->pkt_type=PACKET_HOST;
        /* 'skb->data' points to the start of sk_buff data area. */
        /* *skb->data=pkt_len+8; */
        insb(ioaddr, skb->data, pkt_len.cpu_order +1 );
        signal_read_from_fifo(ioaddr); /* tell TLCS that we are done */
and decided which socket it should go to before i let go of the skb?
        netif_rx(skb);
