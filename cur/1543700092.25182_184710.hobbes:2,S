I forgot to mention that I had been testing 2.4.20 from kernel.org 
also.... And it failed now!
As you see below, /mnt/foo/ad/mozilla was gone. ad/mozilla had been used 
to compare
with dir*/mozilla and it is basically read-only and will never be 
removed by the script.
/mnt/foo/ae is ok and ae/mozilla is of cource there.
It had been almost 2days scince the test started, and the test was 58-th 
turn.
It had run on ext2 filesystem, and the kernel was downloaded from 
kernel.org.
I had seen the same problem--I mean read-only mozilla directory going 
away--
on ext3 on redhat kernel 2.4.20-19.9.
