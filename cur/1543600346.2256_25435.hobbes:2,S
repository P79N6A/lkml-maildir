Fork is easy enough to handle, at least on GNU/Linux.  If you set the
environment variable GMON_OUT_PREFIX, glibc will automatically append
the process ID when writing the gmon.out file.  If you then also do
this in the child after calling fork:
		extern void _start (void), etext (void);
		monstartup ((u_long) &_start, (u_long) &etext);
you will a set of ${GMON_OUT_PREFIX}.pid files, one for the parent and
one for each child.
As far as I know, none of this is documented, though that might just
mean that I missed it.  I think glibc ought to document
GMON_OUT_PREFIX and the right way to call monstartup.
In principle threading could be handled the same way, but glibc would
need to cooperate when generating the profiling output file so that
each thread doesn't overwrite the same file.
