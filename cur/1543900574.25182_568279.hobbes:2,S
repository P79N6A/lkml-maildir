Hi all,
a problem report to something giving me a real headache:
[1.] Kernel hangs when initializing ohci-controller
[2.] The version 2.6.22 of the linux kernel hangs when initializing the
integrated ohci controller of the nvidia MCP51 chipset (pci device ids
vendor:product == 10de:26d). I have traced through various printks that
pci_init calls pci_fixup_device, later on in quirk_usb_ohci_handoff
(file linux/drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c) kernel freezes in this
section:
...
if (control & OHCI_CTRL_IR) {
        int wait_time = 500;
        writel(OHCI_INTR_OC, base + OHCI_INTRENABLE);
        writel(OHCI_ORC, base + OHCI_CMDSTATUS); // this never returns
...
after this, kernel apparently goes into busy waiting (fans gradually
turn louder) and hangs indefinitely. I have also made sure that writel
(in linux/include/asm/io.h) really is entered, but never returns.
[3.] keywords: pci ohci kernel
[4.] /proc/version can not be read, as kernel freezes in startup
[5.] No Oops, no panic
[6.] Reproducible by booting any version 2.6.21+ on that machine
(nvidia MCP51-Chipset, see the lspci output)
[7.1] the ver_linux output under 2.6.20.6, in the directory of 2.6.22,
says:

[7.3] no modules have been configured (all in-kernel)
[7.4] n/a
[7.5] (I cannot run this with 2.6.22. In 2.6.20.6, the output can be
retrieved from 
http://cip.uni-trier.de/~lindem/lspci.txt
 as this is
really large)
[7.6] (I have SATA, but again, I don't reach /proc from within that
kernel)
[7.7] What is striking about that problem is that kernel 2.6.20.6 does
not even enter the section mentioned in [2.]. If booted, serial console
and netconsole do not work either, nor does magic sysrq key. Also, this
is a 64bit cpu, running a 32bit linux distro, and it happens regardless
whether 64bit resources are activated or not.
[X.] I tried hard to understand what's going on, but ultimately, I could
not yet write a fix, workaround, or anything like that, so I am asking
for help/enlightenment, or even an already-done fix. Really very
sorry. Also, different options like noapic, nolapic, acpi=off,
pci=routeirq|biosirq|usepirqmask were already tried; I also tried
disabling quirks for that particular vendor:device-combination, which
leads to another freeze further along. Also, commenting the writel()
will hang indefinitely in the following wait_time loop.
I can only guess that it might
have to do with the patch
"commit 4302a595cd9c6363b495460497ecbda49fa16858
Author: Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>
Date:   Fri Dec 15 06:53:55 2006 +1100
USB: Rework the OHCI quirk mecanism as suggested by David
"
but I don't really have a clue, so this might be groundless suspicion.
If so, I apologize about that.
Greetings and thanks for all the work with the kernel!
