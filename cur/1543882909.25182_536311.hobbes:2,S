It makes it harder to debug (wouldn't it be *nice* to just ssh in, and do
	gdb -p <snapshotter>
when something goes wrong?) but we also *depend* on user space for various 
things (the same way we depend on kernel threads, and why it has been such 
a total disaster to try to freeze the kernel threads too!). For example, 
if you want to do graphical stuff, just using X would be quite nice, 
wouldn't it?
But I do agree that doing everythign in the kernel is likely to just be a 
hell of a lot simpler for everybody.
