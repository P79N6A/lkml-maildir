Right, heap. The thing is, Linux has a greedy memory usage, and tries to
keep as much as possible in memory, this means that we're basically in a
constant state of low memory.
Regular allocations (GFP_KERNEL) can sleep, and can therefore reclaim
memory (write out stuff dirty to disk, swap a little, etc..).
Your allocation (GFP_ATOMIC) isn't allowed to sleep, and can therefore
not reclaim memory -- if it really hits rock bottom, not uncommon, it
just fails to provide memory.
Any code using GFP_ATOMIC (or for that matter, any kernel allocation,
GFP_KERNEL can fail too, just not as easy) must be able to deal with
allocation failures.
How to do that is very domain specific.

Depends on the arch and build details, 4k is a reasonable assumption.
