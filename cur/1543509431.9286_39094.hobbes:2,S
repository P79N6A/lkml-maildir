Yes I know about this. Moving it is on the tag list as is moving pci-scan

Boot time ISAPnP init isnt too big. Fixing the drivers is also fairly
easy because we can do this
static struct blah...{ };
	isapnp_scan(&blah)
and if isapnp_scan ifdefs to nothing when ISAPNP is disabled then 
the struct shouldnt be compiled into the code. If it is then someone
needs to take a large stick to gcc..

And you can now nfsroot off an isapnp card 8)
