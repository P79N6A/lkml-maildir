It's quite obvious with the seteuid() shuffling behind the scenes of the
app, for the mlockall() runs with euid==0, and the later mmap() with euid!=0.
Clearly the application should do both with the same privilege or raise
the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK while running with privileges.
The question that's open is one for the libc guys: malloc(), valloc()
and others seem to use mmap() on some occasions (for some allocation
sizes) - at least malloc/malloc.c comments as of 2.3.4 suggest so -, and
if this isn't orthogonal to mlockall() and set[e]uid() calls, the glibc
is pretty deeply in trouble if the code calls mlockall(MLC_FUTURE) and
then drops privileges.
The function in question appears to be valloc() with glibc 2.3.5.
In this light, mlockall(MCL_FUTURE) is pretty useless, since there is no
way to undo MCL_FUTURE without unlocking all pages at the same time.
Particularly so for setuid apps...
I'm asking the Bcc'd gentleman to reconsider mlockall() and perhaps use
explicit mlock() instead.
