The current "invalidate_inode_pages()" is _not_ equivalent to a specific
user saying "these pages are bad and have to be updated".
The main difference is that invalidate_inode_pages() really cannot assume
that the pages are bad: the pages may be mapped into another process that 
is actively writing to them, so the regular "invalidate_inode_pages()" 
literally must not force a re-read - that would throw out real 
information.
So "invalidate_inode_pages()" really is a hint, not a forced eviction.
A forced eviction can be done only by a user that says "I have write
permission to this file, and I will now say that these pages _have_ to be
thrown away, whether dirty or not".
And that's totally different, and will require a totally different 
approach.
(As to the read-ahead issue: there's nothing saying that you can't wait
for the pages if they aren't up-to-date, and really synchronize with
read-ahead. But that will require filesystem help, if only to be able to
recognize that there is active IO going on. So NFS would have to keep 
track of a "read list" the same way it does for writeback pages).
