That's clear.
What I don't get is what's the point in adding complexity to the
kernel and userspace programs, when it can be done without _any_
changes, just by doing a bind mount.
It's not just calling ->get_sb.  It's finding the right filesystem
daemon, that has been started with the exact same command line
arguments, environment etc.
It's just not practical.
