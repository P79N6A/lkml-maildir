I think I might break out my oscilloscope this weekend and have a look at how 
clean the supply rails are around the cpu and northbridge and southbridge. 
Who knows I might get lucky and see some unexpected ripple or spikes.

Not as bizarre as you may think. I have heard coils and even capacitors "sing"
in years past whilst servicing electronics.

I had not really thought about it from that perspective. Whilst my patch cannot 
alter the handshake times it does prevent consecutive C1 cycles from occurring
too close together. Too close together I think being less than about 800ns. I 
guess I could look at that with a cro too - use an appropriate pin as the trigger
source and see if supply rails have load dump voltage rises when going into
disconnect. Maybe rail voltage rings for about 700ns and might be out of 
tolerence inside Athlon during that time. Would be very interesting if a 
few hundred picofarad of low esr decoupling cap placed on a supply rail near a
chip makes a difference? A pinout of the nforce2 chipset would help a great deal
here but I do not have one. Can anyone oblige me?

No tech info but this link shows user had Lockups with Nvidia's ide driver but
OK with MS one.
