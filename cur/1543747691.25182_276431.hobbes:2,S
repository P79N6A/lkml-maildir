BTW, in case it is misread: Above (except the io performance as such) is
no regression: The other schedulers behave the same on my system.

[slice bumping] Uhm, is it doable via proc? I haven't seen text docs to
your patch and I am not good at kernel code ;-)
My test case was apkm's one: write 1gb continuesly and try to cat a
several gb big file to /dev/null. At the same time I checked starting
other apps/using my emial client...
For me the problem in mainline has been since quite some time...checked 
till kernel 2.6.7.
