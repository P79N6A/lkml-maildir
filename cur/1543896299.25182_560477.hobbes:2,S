probably, I guess the the acpi_device.pnp structs contain enough
informations to detect which one is being handled. I'll get to that
later.

Oh no, we just merged them :)
Anyway, please feel free to add

AFAIK as far as vaios are concerned the spic device (ioport) is mostly
disappearing from newer models and most of the platform specific
operations are gathered through the methods of the acpi only SNC.
I'm also trying to get as many reports as possible[1] from vaio users to
build dmi {black,white}list for functionalities.
So I guess we are going the right direction.
