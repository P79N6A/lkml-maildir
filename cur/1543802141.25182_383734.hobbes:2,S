I have my name on one driver ;)  Once the driver is in the kernel 
I no longer need worry about the source nor backups of my driver, 
okay?  The primary code is in mainstream, this is how it works for 
'leaf node' driver maintainers, at least from my limited perspective.
During development I had to rediff against -mm_latest, as that is 
how drivers (usually?) start the path to mainstream.  But the only 
part need merging for a new driver is the Kconfig entry, a trivial 
issue?
Cheers,
Grant.
