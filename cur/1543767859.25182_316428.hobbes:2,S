There is a misunderstanding in terminology here.
"DOS-type partition table" is for most Linux users the only type
they have ever seen. The msdos in this context does not refer
to a particular filesystem, like the fat or msdos filesystem.
In case you have a problem because you want to access this partition,
give it some nonzero type.
