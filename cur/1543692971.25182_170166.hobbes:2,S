Two notes:
- You should give a patch or at least give a notice that linux/include/hfs* have
  to be killed (or move hfs_fs.h there).
- I had to include linux/sched.h in hfs/sysdep.c to get the definition for
  'current', that was neded in some subinclude of linux/smp_lock. This can be
  caused by any other of my patches, but it doesn't hurt.
TIA
