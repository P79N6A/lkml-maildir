Hi Jeff,
I check the latest kernel source code with git, and find out that the SMBus patch has not been applied yet, 
and the patch for IDE  has not been  applied completely.one more device id should be added to pata_atiixp.c,
l list the patch as following, or you can fetch it from the attached file, could you please apply this for me? 
Thank you very much!
Henry

Splitting up the patches helped us all.  The AHCI, drivers/ide, and now
pata_atiixp patches were applied by the respective maintainers.  Let me
know if you need a quick introduction to git, which is the main tool to
watch the latest Linux kernel source code (it's like CVS, but better :))
I don't know about the SMBus patch, though.  That may or may not have
been applied.
