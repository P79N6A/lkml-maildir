Well, it is probably unnecessary to include config.h for about eight months, but 
as it is not present in feature-removal-schedule.txt I've missed it.  Thanks for 
pointing it out...
FYI, fortunately (for you, unfortunately for VMware) 2.6.18's already broke our 
build script due to UTS_RELEASE being moved to separate file, so from VMware's 
viewpoint killconfig.h.git will not do any additional damage...
