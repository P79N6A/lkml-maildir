Yow, big patch... that is why it did not make it through.  Vger
(silently) rejects email over ~20KB.

Looks good.  I am running it now in my 2.5 tree with no apparent issues
and I looked over the patch and it looked snazzy.
Question: what semantics would be broken if CLONE_CRED was implied by
CLONE_THREAD?  Regardless of code that needs this, it would be nice to
just save the memory when using threads.  Hell,  as far as I am
concerned as long as the tasks still share a VM they could share
credentials - but I am sure that breaks something.
Next, now that all this data no longer belongs solely to current... you
need to be explicit about locking rules.  There is a capability_lock
spinlock but the long semantics are not 100% respected.  I tried to firm
them up in my capability.c cleanup one or two kernels ago... it should
be good enough and not be highly contended.
I guess the only downside would be the extra overhead in our
preciously-fast do_fork... another slab allocation etc. but that is
countered if enough stuff starts using CLONE_CRED.
Oh, and what is with the #if 0 over the set and getaffinity syscalls???
That needs to go!
