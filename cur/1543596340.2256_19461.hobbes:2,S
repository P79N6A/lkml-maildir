[DJW:]  
I argued this at the very beginning, but there was a very strong
view that you needed to run most of the code before you had a user
space to run it in.  I've not followed things closely enough to 
know whether or not this is really true and whether or not it is
inevitable, or just a flaw in the ACPI design.
My feeling has been that ACPI has violated the minimum privilege
concept from the beginning, although I think putting stuff in drivers
that could be at user level is not htat uncommon in Linux.
