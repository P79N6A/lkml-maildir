512 kB is a problem. I've just built a regular 2.3.49 kernel with
IDE, ext2, /proc, and basic networking, and the bzImage is already
472 kB. Granted, there are some 100+ kB of useless strings in there,
but they probably compress well. Don't really need /proc, though.

Hmm, is this some kind of recovery part ? Then it would make sense to
keep this confidential lest some friendly people start spreading
trojans that kill not only your flash but also your only chance to get
it back ...

Let's see ;-) Right now it actually looks as if some additional effort
is needed to bring the kernel as such down to a suitable size. Then we
can see if the additional ~10 kB or so of a user-space based approach
matter. I guess I'll have to hack some extra-slim bootimg that doesn't
use libc at all ... :)
