I have reinstalled kde-base and still cannot launch kfm, or rather,
it launches, but does not display anything nor will kfmclient induce
it to display anything.  There are no errors reported, nothing strange
in the logs.
Since I had seen some messages about socket problems in the Kernel
list, and since kfm opens two named socket files, I'm alerting both groups
in hopes someone has experienced the same trouble.  Another curious
problem is that these files are not deleted with KFM exits.  BTW, I am
assuming these are named sockets, all I really know is they have the 
following ls report:
srw-------   1 garym    staff           0 Jan 23 13:42 /tmp/kfm_500_19378_0.0
srw-------   1 garym    staff           0 Jan 23 13:42 /tmp/kio_500_19378_0.0
kfm from 1.1-apha1 worked fine with Linux 2.2-pre5, and so far, kfm is
the only program I have encountered which does not work since upgrading
to 2.2pre7.

kdelibs-1.1-0.1alpha1rh5x		- I had to recompile this from sources
kdebase-1.1-0.1alpha1rh5x
kdeutils-1.1-0.1alpha1rh5x
the kdelibs is suspicious:  I recompiled this with gcc 2.8 to solve some
incompatibilities with kooBase, and this also required fetching the qt
sources from the primary QT site and recompiling these libraries as
well.
Any recommendations on ways to gather more information on this are
greatly appreciated.
