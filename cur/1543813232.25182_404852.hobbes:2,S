Subject: drivers/scsi/sata_vsc.c: inconsistent NULL checking
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The Coverity checker found this inconsistent NULL checking recently 
introduced by the following commit:
  2ae5b30ff08cee422c7f6388a759f7
  Author: Dan Williams <dan.j.williams@intel.com>
  [PATCH] Necessary evil to get sata_vsc to initialize with Intel iq3124h hba
In function vsc_sata_interrupt():
	err_status = ap ? vsc_sata_scr_read(ap, SCR_ERROR) : 0;
	vsc_sata_scr_write(ap, SCR_ERROR, err_status);
vsc_sata_scr_write() always dereferences ap
(since SCR_ERROR < SCR_CONTROL).
Checking for NULL in one line and unconditionally dereferencing the 
variable in the next line can't be right.
