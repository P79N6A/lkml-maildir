Ugh ... it has been a while since I've looked at or owned this code ;) 
-- but I do seem to recall that on SGI boxes the slot's name was 
different from the physical path of the device (ie, what was stamped on 
the back of the PCI hotplug chassis was different from Linux' PCI name) 
-- OTOH, I haven't recently looked at what slot->physical_path has been 
initialized to, so they might now be one-and-the-same ....
