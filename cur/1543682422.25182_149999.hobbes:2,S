Dear Sirs,
    I was trying to use "make menuconfig" to configure my GNU/Linux kernel 
while the menu crashed at it appears this on the screen:
"  Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
   configuration files and is unable to continue. Her is the error
   report:
    Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu71: command not found
   Please report this to the mantainer <mec@shout.net>. You may also
   send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger@kernel.org>.
   Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
   which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
   make: [***] menuconfig Error 1   "
This is the error. I am trying to configure GNU/Linux Mandrake 9.1 kernel 
version 2.4.21-0.13mdk and this error appear when I try to enter the submenu 
"Advanced Linux Sound Architecture" inside the "Sound" menu.
Bye,
Marco Bresciani
