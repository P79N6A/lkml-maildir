Daniel,
This is very valuable - thanks for makeing the effort.
You could enhance you document greatly if you provided a few diagrams to
illustrate the structure, especially  the example file system.  I'd suggest
converting the document to  HTML or XML.
Also, I'd like to understand how the Phase Tree differs from other tree
schemes used by files systems, for example the Modified Patricia Tree used
by HPFS and NTFS. It wasn't quite clear to me how the advantages of
consistency are obtained, but diagrams might help.

Subject:  Phase tree algorithm defined
I have finally produced something resembling a formal definition of the
phase tree algorithm.  As you will see, this algorithm is somewhat
subtle, and not easy to express in clear simple terms.  But I think that
I have in fact expressed it clearly in simply.  If I have not, I wish
very much to be told so, and why.
You can get a copy here:

Please, if you are especially anal and nasty and have little regard for
anyone's feelings, read this and complain about every little thing that
is wrong with it, and I will greatly appreciate that.  I will also
appreciate comments of the form 'you left out this or that', or 'this
part sounds like so much bafflegab' and so on.
Enjoy.
