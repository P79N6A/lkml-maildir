That freestone piece of crap didn't work for me,
and looking at the code I'm not surprised.
I did a patch against the existing advantechwdt
since the newer advantechs use the w83627hf.
http://www.pixelbeat.org/patches/advantechwdt.diff
I think the advantechwdt.c should be renamed to w83627hf_wdt.c
to avoid confusion (or replaced with the w83627hf_wdt.c
you referenced above, that I didn't notice when
I did this).
Pádraig.
p.s. I needed to merge the info from a couple
of different winbond manuals to do the driver.
Note also the advantech manual describes the
wrong watchdog!
