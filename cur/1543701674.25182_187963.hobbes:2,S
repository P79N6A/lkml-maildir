Hi Greg,
I think I acidentally screwed up by running a script which ran MAKEDEV
while udev was running.
Now /dev/.udev.tdb is very large and devices have strange permissions
they didn't have before.
All I want to do is delete all the extraneous devices in .udev.tdb
and start over.  How do I do that?
Thanks!
