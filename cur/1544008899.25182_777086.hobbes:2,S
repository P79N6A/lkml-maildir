"git cleanup" should be used to catch that classes of problems.  I did
notice that the include file trace used include/asm not
arch/x86/include/asm, which to me implies something like this.
I just tried, and when I make a .i file on a clean tree I get:
# 10 "<full path>/arch/x86/include/asm/posix_types_64.h"
not
# 10 "include/asm/posix_types_64.h"
as the posted .i file has.
