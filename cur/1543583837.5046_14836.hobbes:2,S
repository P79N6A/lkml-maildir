Hello,
	I'm experiencing a problem with an old NE2000 card. I use the ne.c 
driver provided with 2.4.x kernels. (I'm using 2.4.2-ac11)
	The problem is that I can ping the card (with any packet size)
but if I try ssh it doesn't work, the same for other programs which use
TCP. So ICMP works, TCP doesn't and also UDP doesn't work. 
	The interesting thing is that I can view all the packets I send
from another PC using tcpdump. So the card should work as I can see any
packet it sends.
The data of the NE2000 card follow:
	chipset:	UML8001
	IRQ:		5
	I/O ports:	0x320-0x32f
	HW MAC:		55:AA:44:32:39:41
(the MAC is strange, the other cards I have begin all with 00)
Thank you for your attention,
	Gianluca
