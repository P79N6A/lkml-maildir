Yes.  *Especially* outside of religious wars - while fuckup capabilities
of Joe Random Driver Monkey are unlimited, there is a difference between
the impact of fuckups in the code that runs on CPU and in the code that
runs on peripherial.  If nothing else, the latter is less likely to try
anything cute and tricky with locking.
In other words, with code running on the host CPU  lusers have much, much
more ways to luse, luse again when trying to "fix" things and make it
harder to figure out what had caused the bloody mess.
