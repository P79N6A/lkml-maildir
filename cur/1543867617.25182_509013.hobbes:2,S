So, to summarize:
1) You don't contribute to the kernel
2) You recognize the rights of contributors to do with their work what they
please
3) you aren't willing to open source your kernel code.
Why don't you just go with vxWorks or some other embedded OS?  You've recognized
that you are officially getting something (alot of something) for free here, and
are unwilling to play by the rules those who have donated to you set out.  Its
not like you're doing anyone who contributes any favors by using Linux.
Granted, its always good to have more linux devices out there, but if you can't
play by the rules, don't play.
And just so you know, making it easier for open source drivers to operate with
the kernel than closed source drivers isn't "closing" the kernel, its reminding
you that keeping your source closed in linux comes at a price.
