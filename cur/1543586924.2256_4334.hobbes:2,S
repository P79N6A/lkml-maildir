The patches went to Jens Maurer (pci_ids.h), Theodore Y. Ts'o (serial.c
and pci_ids.h) and Tim Waugh (parport_pc.c and pci_ids.h).
Well, and 'extension' may be the wrong word. I just added entries to
pci_ids.h and to the detection tables in parport_pc.c and serial.c

This means create a new module, which does the detection and uses
serial.c and parport_pc.c? I could do this (at least try to :-), but I'd
need some help here. I'm not a kernel hacker, and don't know much about
the pci code, module dependencies, driver tables, hotplugging and all
that stuff. If someone could provide a small sample (or skeleton) code
for this, I'd try my best....
On the other hand, how should the serial and parallel driver detect the
netmos card, if it's a independant module? How could this interfere with
devfs? How should devfsd know if it should load serial.o or netmos.o?
Adding PCI entries to both serial.c and parport_pc.c was that easy....
bye, Michael
