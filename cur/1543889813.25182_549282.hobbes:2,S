Yes.

There was a problem, Andrews machine would not the kernel with the ELF
header.  It was not root caused.  So we are not certain why.

I think we should start there and be prepared to munge the ELF
magic number if there are problems.  Placing ELF notes is going
to require a little work but mostly it should be a matter of
copying the from vmlinux.
Most of that though is just packaging.  The meat of the issue
is how do we upgrade the bootloader data.  Do the changes
below sound like everything we need?
 Field name:	loadflags
 Type:		modify (obligatory)
 Offset/size:	0x211/1
 Protocol:	2.00+
   This field is a bitmask.
   Bit 0 (read):	LOADED_HIGH
 	- If 0, the protected-mode code is loaded at 0x10000.
 	- If 1, the protected-mode code is loaded at 0x100000.
+  Bit 6 (write): KEEP_SEGMENTS
+	Protocol: 2.07+
+	- if 0, reload the segment registers in the 32bit entry point.
+	- if 1, do not reload the segment registers in the 32bit entry point.
+		Assume that %cs %ds %ss %es are all set to flat segments with
+		a base of 0 (or the equivalent for their environment).
 
   Bit 7 (write): CAN_USE_HEAP
 	Set this bit to 1 to indicate that the value entered in the
 	heap_end_ptr is valid.  If this field is clear, some setup code
 	functionality will be disabled.
.....
+Field name:	hardware_subarch
+Type:		write
+Offset/size:	0x23c/4
+Protocol:	2.07+
+
+  In a paravirtualized environment the hardware low level architectural 
+  pieces such as interrupt handling, page table handling, and
+  accessing process control registers needs to be done differently.
+
+  This field allows the bootloader to inform the kernel we are in one
+  one of those environments.
+
+  0x00000000	The default x86/PC environment
+  0x00000001	lguest
+  0x00000002	Xen
+
+Field name:	hardware_subarch_data
+Type:		write
+Offset/size:	0x23c/8
+Protocol:	2.07+
+
+  A pointer to data that is specific to hardware subarch
