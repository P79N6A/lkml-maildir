Yes. My question was: what is a deadlock (in this context) ?
I.e. under what conditions must it _not_ return EDEADLK ?
POSIX makes an attempt at describing it, but in rather vague
terms (see my original posting). Basically, the description
does not exclude EDEADLK already if a process holds any lock,
tries to get any other, and needs to sleep for it.
