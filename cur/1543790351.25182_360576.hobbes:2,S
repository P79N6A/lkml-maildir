It looks like you have ACPI PM and HPET enabled in the kernel, so it
appears your system does not support alternative clocksources. 
You can check to see if a updated BIOS that makes ACPI PM or HPET
available to the OS has been released, or request one from your hardware
vendor.
You might want to try idle=poll as well.
thanks
