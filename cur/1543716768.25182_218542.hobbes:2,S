I disagree.  -mm is the testing ground for -linus.  If this patch
would only break the nvidia module, I couldn't care less.  But
breaking it in such a way that random kernel memory gets corrupted,
which can soon backfire to the filesystem as well?  That's not what
most people understand when calling something "stable".
If this goes in, we should at least detect the nvidia module and
refuse to load it.  Maybe do the same for other modules as well or
refuse to load any module that doesn't somehow state to be ok with 4k
stacks.  Details don't matter, as long as the filesystems survive.
