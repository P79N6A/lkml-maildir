Hey, has something in the networking code gotten screwed up in
the 2.4.0-test7-pre* series? I am using the 3c95x driver & ipv4, and it
seems like half the websites I try to access don't ever respond via lynx
or Netscape.. On the same system, but running kernel 2.2.16, the sites
work fine.. E.g. www.omnisky.com, www.onvia.com, store.palm.com
(www.palm.com works fine.. weird.), the list goes on and on, and I have no
clue what could be causing this..
