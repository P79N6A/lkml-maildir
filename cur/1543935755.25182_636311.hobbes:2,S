I think it must be something like this:
static void limit_fifo(struct uart_port *port)
{
        struct uart_8250_port *up = (struct uart_8250_port *)port;
        unsigned char cval, fcr = 0;
        unsigned long flags;
	/* hopefully not setting the UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO flag will
	 * set it to off. otherwhise the trigger_1 should make the
	 * uart trigger the interrupt immediately after the first
	 * byte comes in
	 */
        fcr = UART_FCR_TRIGGER_1;
        spin_lock_irqsave(&up->port.lock, flags);
        if (up->port.type == PORT_16750)
                serial_outp(up, UART_FCR, fcr);
        serial_outp(up, UART_LCR, cval);                /* reset DLAB */
        up->lcr = cval;                                 /* Save LCR */
        if (up->port.type != PORT_16750) {
                if (fcr & UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO) {
                        /* emulated UARTs (Lucent Venus 167x) need two steps */
                        serial_outp(up, UART_FCR, UART_FCR_ENABLE_FIFO);
                }
                serial_outp(up, UART_FCR, fcr);         /* set fcr */
        }
        serial8250_set_mctrl(&up->port, up->port.mctrl);
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&up->port.lock, flags);
}
But I don't know how to interface this to an ioctl or so.
All help is appreciated!
