read(2) is a cancellation point too. So if the fine userspace code issues 
a random pthread_cancel() to a thread handling that, data is lost together 
with the session that thread was handling. Hmm, I wonder how the world 
could have functioned so far.
Bottom line is, if you really want to throw random cancels to your worker 
threads, you better wrap them into pthread_cleanup_push(). Because 
otherwise, no matter where your cancel hits, you end up with a broken 
system.
