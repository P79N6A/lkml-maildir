Do you think there are some benefits by inserting the re-schedule in the
drivers/sound/mpu401.c file ? ( less CPU usage)
for (timeout = 30000; timeout > 0 && !output_ready(devc); timeout--);
But since the FIFO is only 2 bytes long = 600usecs, 
the schedule() could cause a MIDI bandwidth decrease,
but would keep CPU load down , right ?
Why was the MPU401 code not tuned that way ?
regards,
Benno.
