Wrong.  Every 19 seconds is a new BK connection.  The HTTP connections are
at least an order of magnitude more frequent.  And increasing, more and 
more people are becoming aware that the source is there and you can 
point to it.

Ha.  Don't I wish.  Peak connection rates are a lot higher than that.

It's not my working day or the other people who work locally, all our
phones are on a 100Mbit switched net to the 3com before it goes out on
POTS.  It's the remote people.  And half our company is currently remote.
I could write a book on how well remote does and doesn't work.
