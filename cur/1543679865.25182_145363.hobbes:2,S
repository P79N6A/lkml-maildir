I'm no hardware expert, however, that approach contains potential race 
condition - not a system critical one, but something we should be concerned 
about. If one cpu tries to read a u_int64_t variable while another tries to 
update it, the worst case scenario is that the reader will get the high 
32-bits before the write, and low 32-bit after the write, now if the counter 
overflow, the number would be off by 4GB! (This only applies to 32-bit 
architectures.) True, there are cache coherency algorithms, etc...

I believe that on any kind of router some at some point in time would like to 
know the data transfered.
Jeff.
