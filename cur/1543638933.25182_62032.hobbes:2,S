Sorry, but it is the new driver API right now :)
PCI is pretty much already done in the latest 2.5 kernel, and I'm trying
to finish up the USB conversion within the next few days.
Also, to address all of the other comments that I snipped out of your
email, please go read the documentation and paper at:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mochel/doc/
to get an idea of what is happening, and what it looks like.
You can also mount driverfs right now to see what it looks like for your
system.
If you have any further questions or comments after reading the above
documentation, and playing around with the existing driverfs filesystem,
please let us know.
thanks,
greg k-h
