there was a bug in the first iteration of the flexible-mmap patch,
introduced during a cleanup of the patch. The bug resulted in the VM
throwing -ENOMEM's after the first ~3GB worth of mmap()s are done. So if
an app did lots of repeat mmap()/munmap()s [like vuescan most likely],
it would 'run out of memory' while there's still plenty of free VM left. 
This bug is fixed in the current flexible-mmap patch included in -mm4.
