your patch looks good to me. I believe the killer argument is what you
mentioned previously, that a single GFP is cheaper than a single I/O op,
so even the worst-case (an I/O app doing precisely one I/O op during its
scheduling atom - very unlikely) shouldnt degrade all that much. The
patch is a speedup in every other case.
