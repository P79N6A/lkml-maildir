note that there is something relevant to improve in the implementation,
that is the per-cpu irq stack size should be bigger than 4k, we use 16k
on x86-64, on x86 it should be 8k. Currently you're decreasing _both_
the normal kernel context and even the irq stack in some condition.
There's no good reason to decrease the irq stack too, that's cheap, it's
per-cpu.
