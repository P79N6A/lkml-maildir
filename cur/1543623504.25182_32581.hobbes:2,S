Random thoughts on this:
- ifconfig sets txlength, and could channels get into contention?
- if you reduce buffers too far performance sucks.
- did you look at just reducing the packet size (MTU)?
You should really use the above methods to diddle parameters and
benchmark. If nothing else you can point to numbers as a reason to make
any change.
