Digital had a reasonable solution for this problem. They marked
all the Digital-specific parts of their pages. If you ignore those
parts, you have documentation for POSIX, XPG4, or whatever.
Here is a quote from the mkdir.2 man page:
-------- begin quote --------
[ENOTDIR] A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
[EROFS]   The named file resides on a read-only file system.
[Digital] For NFS file access, if the mkdir() function fails, errno
may also be set to one of the following values:
[ENFILE]  Indicates either that the system file table is full, or that
          there are too many files currently open in the system.
[ESTALE]  Indicates a stale NFS file handle.  A client cannot make a
          directory because the server has unmounted or unexported
          the remote directory.
-------- end quote --------
Command options are done in a similar way:
-------- begin quotes --------
  -f  Generates a full listing.
  -l  Generates a long listing.
  -m  [Digital]  Prints all threads in a task, if the task has more than one.
  -r  [Digital]  Enables warning messages.
-------- end quotes --------
So we would need something like this:
[Linux] When the immutable bit (see chattr(1)) is set...
