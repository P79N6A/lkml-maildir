The part with the case is ok, except that you don't have to write
struct compat_timeval __user *ctv;
ctv = (struct compat_timeval __user*) userstamp;
Instead,
struct compat_timeval __user *ctv = userstamp;
is the more common way to write it. The result is the same, since
userstamp is a 'void __user *'.

You need to to exactly that, yes. I'm not sure what exactly you have
tested, but the expected result of your code would be that you see
the sk_stamp.tv_sec value in the output, but not the tv_usec value.
On little-endian system like x86_64, that is not much of a difference
(less than a second) that you might miss in a test case, but on
big-endian, it would be fatal.
The layout of the structures on most systems is 
		64 bit LE	64 bit BE	32 bit
bytes 0-3	tv_sec low	tv_sec high	tv_sec low
bytes 4-7	tv_sec high	tv_sec low	tv_usec low
bytes 8-11	tv_usec low	tv_usec high
bytes 12-15	tv_usec high	tv_usec low
You code copies the first eight bytes of the 64 bit data structure
into the 32 bit data structure.
