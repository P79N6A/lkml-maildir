Well, it fails to compile also 2.4. A 2.4 kernel that worked fine hangs when
launching init if built with this gcc. It boots again if is built at -O instead
of -O2.
I think it is a Mandrake specific problem, as changelog reads:
* Tue Dec 16 2003 Gwenole Beauchesne <gbeauchesne@mandrakesoft.com> 3.3.2-2mdk
- Add gcj(1), aka make gc happy
- Add [ep]mmintrin.h for even for SSE/PNI intrinsics
- Move cc1 to gcc-cpp, thusly nuking gcc dep for XFree86
- Remove -funit-at-a-time from -O2 since it is memory hungry
* Mon Dec 15 2003 Gwenole Beauchesne <gbeauchesne@mandrakesoft.com> 3.3.2-1mdk
- 3.3.2 + 3.3-hammer branch (2003/12/08)
I think I don't like that hammer branch...
Thanks.
