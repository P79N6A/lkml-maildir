Thanks for the error identification.  The other drive is of a
*different* model.  This drive showed this behavior from the day I
bought it.  The drive could be going bad, but I doubt it.  Is it
possible that this manufacturer (Conner) has some peculiar
implementation of the spec?  I recall reading on this list sometime
back of similar workarounds to unusual drives.

Can I turn on debug mode in runtime, or do I need to recompile
ide-scsi? 
Take care,
