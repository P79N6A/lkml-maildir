Subject: PATCH: EDAC - change default, also handle pulled hardware

If a card reports 0xFFFF check if the devid is also all 0xFFFFFFFF and
if so assume the card was pulled rather than showing parity errors. This
avoids us spewing errors when a card is yanked and hotplug hasn't caught
up with it.
Also default PCI scan to off as it has a performance impact and is
relevant to a minority of users only. Users can enable it when they need
it.
