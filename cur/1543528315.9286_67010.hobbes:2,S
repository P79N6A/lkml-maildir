I'm sorry if I wasn't very clear. The IBM JFS I meant is the JFS for OS/2. They
have released the source of the OS/2 version and have started a port for Linux.
On Monday or Tuesday they released version 0.02 which has now the capabilities
of :
mkdir, rmdir, create file
It compiles under Linux but you need to do some cleanup work. I believe they
use a RH kernel which has it's own patches (I think).
