I think Linus once said that he does not consider the kernel to 
become part of a combined work when an application uses the kernel.
I tend to agree, it's gray (unless Linus explicitly colorizes it) -- 
IIRC the GPL allows a GPL and closed program to interact if they do so 
using 'standard' interfaces, i.e. passing a file as argument, or 
shell redirection, communicating over a pipe or a socket, etc.
But OTOH, linking code makes it a combined work.
And the question now is: Since the kernel is the one providing these 
standard services, what would apply? Do userland and kernel communicate 
by means of linking or by means of standardized interfaces (in this case -
fixed syscall numbers or thelike). I'd say the latter. An application 
does not link with the kernel IMHO, no symbol resolution is done.

Oh well I was rather interpreting the question as "What about Hurd?" and 
my answer was the same from the Hurd page last time I read it.
"It's not so complete to make up a production system." or similar.

Don't tell me you like the Solaris way of naming devices. :)
