Hi Dave,
> There are several stupid bugs in binfmt_elf's core dumping code.
Back in 1.3.XX I noticed a bunch of bugs in binfmt_elf.c like the ones
you report.  Somebody cleaned up most of them a long time, but basically,
Eric Youngdale wrote bad code.  I don't say this lightly.  He wrote the
original xconfig parser too, which has caused me a lot of grief.
I recommend someone with a clue take a baseball bat or a chainsaw to
fs/binfmt_elf.c.
