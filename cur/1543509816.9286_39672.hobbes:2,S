It occurred to me last night that the netfilter model could easily be
applied to resource limits, quotas, process accounting, etc., which would
allow much greater flexibility and potentially unify several disparate
pieces of code. I've spent a little time looking at the code and I thought
I'd solicit some opinions before I dive in.
What I'm thinking of is changing the net/core/netfilter code to be
generic. Only some of the code in it is network specific - there's the
NF_DROP code which calls kfree_skb and some debugging code. So I think it
should be relatively easy to make a generic replacement for nf_hook_slow
and nf_iterate, etc., that take longs rather than pointers, then change
NF_HOOK to do a bit of casting. Then, it becomes easy to add QUOTA_HOOK
and RLIM_HOOK taking different types of arguments. Finally add an ops
table to call subsystem-specific functions like kfree_skb and possibly
debugging funcs.
