A lot lot more than that. There are some cases where what you are saying is
true and we have duplication. The worst culprit was the cd layer and that
has been cleaned up for a while now.
In most of the other cases it varies what is done in drive firmware or in
userspace by the app. Reimplementing half of the drive firmware in kernel
space not user space does not appeal
Where it just normalising ioctl numbers I'd agree 100%
