Let us encourage him to give us some warning, like 60 days of warning. 
 Let us also encourage him to code freeze VM and VFS first not last (I 
think he agrees with this fortunately).  I am not going to say anything 
about when I would like that freeze to hit, except that we won't be 
ready before September/October because I am finally able to take the 
time to do things right in the design and so I will.  If he freezes in 
~September, we'll have an experimental Reiser4 for him.  Or so I fondly 
hope and vaporize.;-)  
What about the zero-copy stuff I keep hearing rumors about?  How ready 
to go is it?  We want ReiserFS to be well-integrated with it if possible.
