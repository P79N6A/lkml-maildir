at least, the file "modules.pcimap" tells you which modules support these
devices, by vendor/model codes. I once developped a little installation script
which loaded all the NICs it could by listing /proc/bus/pci/devices and
modules.pcimap. I too agree that names in /proc/pci are *really* useful, but I
often omit them when I need a very little image. Perhaps having a list of names
only for devices supported by the kernel and modules at compile time would be
an acceptable compromise ?
