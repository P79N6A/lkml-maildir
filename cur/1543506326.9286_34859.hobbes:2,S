[OK, I finally figured out the new mailing list address]
Will the NFS client changes from the -ac* patches be merged into the
2.2 and 2.3 kernels? I'm asking because the NFS code in the stock 2.2
and 2.3 kernels has a problem with file permission checking that is
solved in the ac patches. The problem has to do with setuid programs,
and is easily demonstrated by issuing the following commands in an
NFS-mounted directory:
$ mount | cat > x
$ ls -l x
-rw-r--r--   1 dicks    sec          1172 Aug 18 17:48 x
$ mount > x
$ ls -l x
-rw-r--r--   1 dicks    sec             0 Aug 18 17:48 x
