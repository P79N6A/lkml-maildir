and if you want to pass arguments, to guarantee that no optimization will
be done, even on loop constants ?
eg:
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    j++;
    __nop();
  }
-> might be optimized this way :
  j = N;
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    __nop();
  }
Perhaps using a volatile for j ?
Cheers,
Willy
