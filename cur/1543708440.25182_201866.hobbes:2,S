I may be wrong, but this description seems to me more like an example for
bad design and implementation rather than for a bad general idea.

By principle, the "least common denominator" type container layers are
bad, because of not being extendable; you are completely right here. A
class-like driver object model seems better to me. And the class-like
model is not the only one that is nicely extendable. You seem to be
knowledgeable on the topic - what driver object model would you suggest
for a driver layer model?
