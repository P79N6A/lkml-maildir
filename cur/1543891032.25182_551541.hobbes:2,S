Cool.
My patch does not change the functionality of the code just complains
very loudly that it is broken.
Further the code is broken at a design level.  The code isn't
problematic the code is impossible.  The cpu hotplug code can not be
fixed on x86 without a redesign of the generic cpu hotplug code.
Suspend does not need to use cpu hotplug because it already gets in
deep with the drivers, and can stop interrupts at the source.  I know
there was some talk about this doing this earlier, but I don't know if
anything came of that discussion.
Regardless if you care about this being a problem feel free to fix the
relevant code so it attempts to do something that the hardware
actually supports.
But if the suspend needs this code for smp support it is also broken.
