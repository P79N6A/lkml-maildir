Should be easily fixable - in general, set 64-bit dma mask. Then when
you detect an atapi device, lower the dma mask settings to 32-bit dma
for that device only. So the pci device in question gets a full 64-bit
dma mask, the attached scsi devices can have lower masks if necessary.
I'd suggest doing this off slave config.
