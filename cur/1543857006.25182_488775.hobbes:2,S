It's a tiered system ;-)
* if at all possible, provide patches against the latest linux-2.6.git
* if there are dependencies in #upstream-fixes or #upstream (i.e. I 
already applied some of your patches), provide patches against 
#upstream-fixes or #upstream
#ALL is a branch that is blown away at will, and is really more of a 
testing and akpm sync point.  Don't worry about conflicts with 
promise-sata-pata, I take care of those when I merge the #ALL branch 
together.
