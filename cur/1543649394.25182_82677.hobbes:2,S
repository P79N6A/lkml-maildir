Subject: ADMIN: STOP pleading on Listmasters...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We can create an "offtopic@vger.kernel.org" list for
everyone who want to discuss on topics which are way
off from whatever current Subject: line is.
For that matter, if you folks want, we can even
create a  "catfight@vger.kernel.org"  list for
name-calling and other anti-social kind of
behaviours.
This topic is NOT available for public discussion.
If you want to plead on listowners, send your plea
to  postmaster@vger.kernel.org
Doing to group-reply including the list shows only
that you can not follow instructions.
