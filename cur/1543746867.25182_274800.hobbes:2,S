There is --- if there wasn't, I wouldn't be able to reproduce the oops
on demand. :-)
The trouble is that ext3_free_branches() calls ext3_forget() and
ext3_free_blocks() in that order.  The ordering is fairly important: we
don't ever want to get the revoke bits in the bh out-of-sync with what's
in the bitmaps.  (Ordering wrt the journal is far less important because
those are committed atomically.)
And while ext3_free_blocks() has the check for freeing blocks in the
system zone, ext3_forget() does not.  So we assert-fail on the initial
attempt to forget a b_committed_data bh before we get to the system-zone
check.
Cheers,
 Stephen
