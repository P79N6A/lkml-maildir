In the near future i'm going to be playing around with 
software raid as a personal research project. The 
hardware will probably look like this:
K6-2 processor ~300Mhz, 64 MB ram
4-6 atapi disks ~6GB or so running off of the motherboard
and an add-in card (probably  ata-66 pci cards)
Questions:
Is this system likely to be cpu limited (for raid levels 3, 5)
or does it have enough power to expect that the disks will be fully
utilized?
is the raidable component large enough to reasonably expect that
i will encounter the effects of raid (increased read capacity,
increased latency, potential for degraded write speed, cpu 
loading from parity calculations and so on)?
rephrase: will this hit scalability issues inherent to raid
and not be dwarfed by other factors (atapi weirdness for example)?
Are there any changes you would make (aside from a scsi implementation,
due to money) to reduce outside factors? 
thanks,
-chris
