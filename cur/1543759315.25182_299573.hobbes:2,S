Several non-BK developers use the first -rc1 as a merge point.
Others simply trust that _Linus_ has a lot more smarts than an automated 
script, about deciding when a good testing point should occur.  Holy 
Penguin Pee has value, they feel.

If you want people to start testing, a good first step would be 
understanding why this is so.
Users have been trained that -rc means "serious bugfixes only".  You are 
trying to re-train them.  That just won't work.
When you do an -rc1 or -rc2, it is not serious bugfixes only. 
_Especially_ rc1.  rc1 is in no way "bugfixes only."  Non-BK developers 
just treat the first couple -rc's as a merge point, while the rest of us 
BK developers have already gone into "send bugfixes only" mode.
You are fighting an uphill battle against user perceptions and training.
