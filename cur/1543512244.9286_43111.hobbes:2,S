Because devfs only forwards the name the driver gives it.
If the driver registers: /dev/USB/foo, 256 devices, then devfs
shows /dev/USB/foo[000-256]. (mangled widlcard, I know)

What does devfsd know about naming USB devices that the USB
driver doesn't?  A daemon specificly USB aware would be needed
if the problem is really as intractable as Ted T'so asserts.
In which case the _actual_device_name_ isn't so relevant as what 
is done with it. If you plug in a USB floppy you might get a device
named /dev/USB/b0h5n14, but if the daemon knows what kind of device
it is it can inform the user appropriately. Such information would
have to be passed to the daemon by syscall(), /dev/USB/status, or
ioctl(USB_STAT) on the device. I personally would favor the 
/dev/USB/status solution because you can do a string search
on it for a desired device type instead of having to open(), ioctl(),
and close() each device until you found the right one. Ted is right
that as a method for identifying devices it is nasty.
If the daemon gets stumped, it can _ask_ the user "what did you
just plug into me Pietr?", then treat it appropriately.
Neither devfs nor the USB driver can or should have _that_
capability.
None of this means that devfs is irrelevant to the task
at hand, it just sounds like more is being asked of it
than it is explicitly designed to do.

Quite possibly.
