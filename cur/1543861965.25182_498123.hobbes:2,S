Hmm, I guess a good question is: Why should I have to edit the inf file?
Is it an issue of them making it only install if your hardware is
already set to ahci mode?  But how am I supposed to boot and install the
driver until I have the driver installed then.  Well I might try that
next time I go there.  How stupid of intel.
