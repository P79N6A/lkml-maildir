No, I'm sure you are covered. The situation I thought of would be
something like the following:
CPUs 0-63, all within distance 4 --- gap distance 5 --- CPUs 64-127.
Where you wouldn't have any overlap between the two sets of CPUs.
This is probably not applicable to you though.

Yeah I would agree. No doubt you could spend a long time on improving
it. Start simple so you have a baseline of course.
If you're going to be looking at this, take a look at the way we're
building domains in the "[PATCH] consolidate sched domains" patch I
posted the other day. It may simplify your job as well, for example if
you can make use of the init_sched_build_groups function.
