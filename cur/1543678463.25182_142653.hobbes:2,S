Hi Felipe.
For those who aren't familiar, you've utilised the secret desktop weapon:
+		if (!(p->time_slice % MIN_TIMESLICE) &&
This is not how Ingo intended it. This is my desktop bastardising of the 
patch. It was originally about 50ms (timeslice granularity). This changes it 
to 10ms which means all running tasks round robin every 10ms - this is what I 
use in -ck and is great for a desktop but most probably of detriment 
elsewhere. Having said that, it does nice things to desktops :-)
