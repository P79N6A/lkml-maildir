	1. After upgrading my memory up to 1BG (2x512MB SDRAM) previosly 512MB
(2x256MB SDRAM) I try to boot 2.6.0-test5 compiled without highmem
support with boot-time option mem=512M and I got an Oops right before
the checks for memory (15th-16th row of dmesg).
It can't boot without mem=512M option even.
	2. 2.4.20 (without highmem support) boots fine with same option, but
can't boot without it (?same? Oops).
	3. 2.6.0-test7 _WITH_ highmem enabled boots but I get 2 kernel Oops for
24 hours.
	4. 2.6.0-test5 _with_ highmem reboots itself before getting to login
prompt,  I was told  about this by my hosting support.
	5. 2.4.22 with high mem works fine... for now
	1, 2, 3 had happaned in my presence.
	I can't provide traces. It is productional server.
