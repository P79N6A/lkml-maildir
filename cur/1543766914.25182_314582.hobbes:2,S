Uuids's at this level are inherently bogus, unless of course you have more 
than 2**32 cluster nodes.  I don't know about you, but I do not have even 
half that many nodes over here.
Translation tables are just the thing for people who can't get by without 
uuids.  (Heck, who needs uuids, just use root's email address.)

I believe cman gives you an address in AF_CLUSTER at the same time it hands 
you your event socket.  Last time I did this, the actual mechanism was buried 
under a wrapper (magma) so I could have that got that slightly wrong.  
Anybody want to clarify?

Since cman has now moved to user space, userspace does not tell the kernel 
about membership, it just gets a socket+address from cman, which tells cman 
that the node just joined.  Kernel code can also join the cluster if it wants 
to, likewise by poking cman.  I'm not sure exactly how that works now that 
cman has been moved into userspace.  (Hopefully, docs will appear here soon.  
One could also read the posted patches...)

Can we have a list of all the reasons that you cannot wrap your heartbeat 
interface around cman, please?  You will need translation for the UUIDs, you 
will keep your security model as-is (possibly showing everybody how it should 
be done) and you are perfectly free to use whatever transport you wish when 
you are not talking directly to cman.
Factoid: I do not use PF_CLUSTER for synchronization in my block devices, 
simply because regular tcp streams are faster in this context.  As far as I 
know (g)dlm is the only user of PF_CLUSTER for any purpose other than talking 
to cman.

Passing things around via sockets is a powerful model.  PF_UNIX can even pass 
a socket to kernel, which is how I go about setting up communication for my 
block devices.  I think (g)dlm calls open() from within kernel, something 
like that.  The exact method used to get hold of the appropriate socket is a 
just matter of taste.  Of course, I like to suppose that _my_ method shows 
the most taste of all.

Of course, we could always read the patches...
