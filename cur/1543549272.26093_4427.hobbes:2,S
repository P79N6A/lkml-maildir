No, that's not it - the way most distributions do SCSI auto-detection is
to load modules until they succeed.
At least I _think_ that's what they do. That's what I'd do if I were a
distribution maker.
Anyway, I fixed this one up (untested), and fixed another thing that would
cause modules to not get the version information correctly, and made a
pre4. Whatever the cause for it not having been noticed before, it was a
bug. And it should be gone. Good.
