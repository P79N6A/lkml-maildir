That's a Kconfig policy that's not always followed.  In this
case, I was getting fed up with "select".  It so rarely does
what it needs to do, and I've started to think it'd be better
to just always avoid that fragility than battle it.

For one thing, I didn't see it until after I posted this one...
other than that, the basic approach could well be fine; I didn't
go through it in detail.
But on the other hand, it seems that only the ASIX code will work
right; the DM9601 and MCS7830 Kconfig is different/wrong.
