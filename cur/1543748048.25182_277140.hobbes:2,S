regs->esp is < 0 almost always - user stack starts at 0xBFFFFFFF, which
is negative number when you treat it as 'long'.  Change is wrong, now
when esp is in top 2GB 'address' is never evaluated as invalid, and it
was definitely not intention.
Correct is (if any fix is needed at all) typecast regs->esp to unsigned
long, eventually with check that address is less than (unsigned long)-32,
as area at VA 0 is not going to grow "down" to 0xFFFFFxxx, even if you
nicely ask.
                                                     Best regards,
                                                            Petr Vandrovec
