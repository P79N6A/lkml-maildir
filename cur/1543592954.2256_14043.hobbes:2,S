Have you tried the patch? Because the gameport.h define has:
#if defined(CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT) || (defined(CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT_MODULE) && defined(MODULE))
void gameport_register_port(struct gameport *gameport);
void gameport_unregister_port(struct gameport *gameport);
#else
void __inline__ gameport_register_port(struct gameport *gameport) { return; }
void __inline__ gameport_unregister_port(struct gameport *gameport) { return; }
#endif
I think it should work.
