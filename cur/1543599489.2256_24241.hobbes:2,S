That is still pretty awful ... but it doesn't stop working?

Ok, that means the "D-Link magic" does improve reset.
It may be interesting to find out which parts that help. I simply added
things that looked good ... Lacking information on what the bit-flipping
is supposed to do, one way to try and do that is to remove code and see
how much can be removed without breaking anything.
(Sounds like a childrens game, except for programmers ...)
I'll still try generating collisions and see what happens. If I can't
reproduce this perhaps you would test a different patch to see which
change that made a difference?
