It's normal an IMO a bad thing -- but not trivial to fix.
My guess is the system run out of ran so the kernel killed something
at random, which in your case was inetd.
FreeBSD kills the largest process running which may not be a
brilliant way to go, but is better than killing something at random
IMO (flames in private, we don't need this thread again!)
