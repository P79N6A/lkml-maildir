I've been trying, but haven't managed to reproduce that message
yet. At the time I was doing "rm -rf" on several kernel source trees.
But while trying to reproduce that, I got this:
__elevator_merge: req latency 4039 req latency 4037
__elevator_merge: req latency 4057 req latency 4044
__elevator_merge: req latency 4020 req latency 4017
