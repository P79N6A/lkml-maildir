Subject: [PATCH] set*uid() must not fail-and-return on OOM/rlimits
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Willy and all,
Attached is a trivial patch (extracted from 2.4.33-ow1) that makes
set*uid() kill the current process rather than proceed with -EAGAIN when
the kernel is running out of memory.  Apparently, alloc_uid() can't fail
and return anyway due to properties of the allocator, in which case the
patch does not change a thing.  But better safe than sorry.
As you're probably aware, 2.6 kernels are affected to a greater extent,
where set*uid() may also fail on trying to exceed RLIMIT_NPROC.  That
needs to be fixed, too.
Opinions are welcome.
Thanks,
Alexander
