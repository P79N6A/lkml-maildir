Why not avoid poking around in dangerous device spaces. We don't have a
bitmap to protect /dev/mem either. The problem is similar too, we have many
devices with config space beyond the guaranteed bytes that do fatal
things that are not driven directly by Linux - eg some bridges have acpi
stuff overlapping there.
A non root user can only touch the safe bytes
