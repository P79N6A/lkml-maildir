I use to get those hard locks, but I wasn't sure if was my hardware or
the kernel using preempt. After using 2.5.30 for a while, those lock ups
went away, but the progression to this bug happen first with a scheduler
crash in the TCP/IP stack being triggered and then after that application of
Mingo's patch (from a previous email) that fixed the crashes, it started
to trigger ext3 assertions.
It's a very strange bug. Not sure what to say about it.
