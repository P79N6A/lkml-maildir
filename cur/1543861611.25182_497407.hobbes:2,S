I think I noticed other problems of avoiding workqueue_mutex() in
flush_work() ..don't recall the exact problem.

sure, cwq->thread != NULL at CPU_DEAD event. However
cleanup_workqueue_thread() will set it to NULL and block in
kthread_stop(), waiting for the kthread to finish run_workqueue and
exit. If one of the work functions being run by run_workqueue() calls
flush_workqueue()->flush_cpu_workqueue() now, flush_cpu_workqueue() can fail to 
recognize that "keventd is trying to flush its own queue" which can
cause deadlocks.

The test fails in the window described above.

Can you elaborate this a bit?

I agree it minimizes the interactions. Maybe worth attempting. However I
suspect it may not be as simple as it appears :)
