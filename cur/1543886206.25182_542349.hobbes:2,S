I have doubts.  IMO the previous code is 100% correct as long as 1 SBP-2
target LU maps to 1 Scsi_Host.
The lifetime of the Scsi_Host would only be longer than that of the LU
if all LUs (or all LUs at the same initiator port) would be added beneath
the same instance of Scsi_Host.  Then the lifetime of the Scsi_Host would
be that of the fw-sbp2 driver, or that of fw-sbp2's representation of a
FireWire bus.
However, I'll see how it turns out in your update patch.
