Yes, sorry, your are right. To much configuring in my brain.
Check the new config. I suppose I only need the Intel PII/ICH SATA
support (as my lspci tells me).
But I get the same result; a Kernel Panic VFS not found (8,3)... but
my HDD is on /dev/sda3.
Is there any why I can get more detailed info out of my kernel-boot
(except from my screen)?
Any other hints?
Thanks for your help.
Zeno
