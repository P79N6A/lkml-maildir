I have examined my system and HZ is 100, but there is no DEF_COUNTER, but
#define DEF_PRIORITY    (20*HZ/100) /* 210 ms time slices */
Is this mean the time-slice of Linux is about 210ms, it's so big. Is there
some way to reduce it and of course don't make the system unstable? If so,
it's great for my develop.
Regards.
