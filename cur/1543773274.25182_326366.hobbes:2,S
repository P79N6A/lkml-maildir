The last step can be just "git commit", and it will do the right thing
these days (and with a nice big warnign that it looks like you're
committing a merge).
In fact, it's much preferable that you use "git commit", because it will
also then remove the old MERGE_HEAD if the commit was successful, leaving
the state proper (so that subsequent "git commit" things don't think it's
a merge). It also makes it less likely that you forget your parents.
Maybe.

Yeah, something as simple as
	rm -f .merge_file_*
in git-resolve-script should fix it..
