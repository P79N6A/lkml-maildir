Yah, I'm pretty sure that's what it is.  I just tried it again, and I
couldn't get it to happen again, but, like I'd expect, none of the
graphics (anywhere on the screen) updated with the wireframe up.  I'd
guess xmms has some incorrect synchronization between its audio and
display threads, and I just happened to be hitting that consistently
last night, but not now.
