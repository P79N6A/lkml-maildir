I wholeheartedly second your views, it would be way way better if all I2C
chips had an ID register. However, having a separate driver for every
chip doesn't actually solve the undifferenciability issue. You can't
prevent the user from loading the wrong driver. Also, the problem isn't
specific to the m41txx family of chips, many other families of chips
suffer the same.
The main problem here is that i2c-core currently lacks a mechanism which
would let us explicitely attach a given driver (and chip type within
that driver) to an arbitrary adapter, address pair. I will be working on
implementing this with the help of others in the next few weeks. RTC
drivers and media/video drivers should enjoy this new interface.
Thanks,
