See the mempool implementation. Even before bio used mempool, it used
the exact same logic to make sure it never fails. Basically the
heuristic in both cases is:
repeat:
	bio = normal_alloc
	if (bio)
		return bio
	bio = get_from_pool
	if (bio)
		return bio
	if (gfp_mask & __GFP_WAIT)
		start disk i/o
		goto repeat;

This whole dead lock debate has been done to death before, I suggest you
find the mempool discussions in the lkml archives from the earlier 2.5
series. Basically we maintain deadlock free allocation although we never
fail allocs by saying that a single bio allocation is short lived (or
at least not held indefinetely). That plus a reserve of XX bios makes
sure that someone will always return a bio to the pool sooner or later
and at least the get_from_pool alloc above will succeed sooner or later
even if vm pressure is ridicilous.
