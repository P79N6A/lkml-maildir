There are sites (
http://uml.nagafix.co.uk/
 being the best one I know
of) where, with two downloads, two uncompressions, and one command
line later, you have a booted UML.
The only way I know of to improve on this, aside from inprovements in
the booted distro, is to package the filesystem as a rootfs within the
UML kernel binary.  I've considered this, but haven't done anything
with it.
