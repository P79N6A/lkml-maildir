Subject: [PATCH] NFS/RPC/GSS - oops in gss_pipe_release()
Date: Fri, 16 Sep 2005 13:40:15 -0400
From: Steve Dickson <SteveD@RedHat.com>

During some recent debugging I found that an oops can
occur in gss_pipe_release() because the client handle
that is being passed in has already been freed.
The scenario is as follows:
1) root# mount -o sec=krb5 server:/export /mnt/export
2) user$ ls /mnt/export (which hangs because user does not
                        have the correct credentials)
3) root# reboot
The oops occurs when the /mnt/export filesystem
is unmounted. The reason being is gss_pipe_release()
was already called when the ls process was killed.
The stack dump of the ls process was:
   [<e09dda84>] gss_pipe_release+0x74/0xd8 [auth_rpcgss]
   [<e0a045c0>] rpc_pipe_release+0xa5/0xb9 [sunrpc]
   [<c015a9d6>] __fput+0x55/0x100
   [<c0159626>] filp_close+0x59/0x5f
   [<c012363f>] put_files_struct+0x57/0xc0

   [<c01244fa>] sys_exit_group+0x0/0xd
   [<c02d120b>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
So when the rpc_shutdown_client code is called
via the umount:
   [<e09dda84>] gss_pipe_release+0x74/0xd8 [auth_rpcgss]
   [<e0a0447c>] rpc_close_pipes+0x80/0x9a [sunrpc]

   [<e0a05005>] rpc_rmdir+0x5a/0x89 [sunrpc]
   [<e09fcede>] rpcauth_free_credcache+0x87/0xd0 [sunrpc]
   [<e09f8431>] rpc_destroy_client+0x70/0xa4 [sunrpc]
   [<e09f8421>] rpc_destroy_client+0x60/0xa4 [sunrpc]
   [<e09f83ba>] rpc_shutdown_client+0xd1/0xd8 [sunrpc]
   [<c011e586>] default_wake_function+0x0/0xc
   [<e0aefe75>] nfs_kill_super+0x38/0x63 [nfs]
the client handle (which is in the rpc_inode) passed
to gss_pipe_release() has already been freeded.
It appears from other places in the code (namely
rpc_close_pipes()) that the only way to invalidate
an rpc_inode is to set the ops pointer to NULL which
is what the attached patch does.
Is there a better way to invalid an rpc_inode?
steved.
This patch stops the release_pipe() funtion from being called
twice by invalidating the ops pointer in the rpc_inode
when rpc_pipe_release() is called.
