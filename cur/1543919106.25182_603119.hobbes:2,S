Morning,
Lately I've been having issues with one of my machines' CIFS mounts. Failure
seems rather random to me, but most often occurs after adding new torrents to
Azureus.
I see no irregular messages on my Samba server machine, and other machines can
access the server fine.
Dmesg:
 CIFS VFS: server not responding

 ...the above message repeats for dozens of times for various open files...
Closing all applications (otherwise unmounting fails due to open files) and then
remounting seems to "solve" this.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions and ideas!
