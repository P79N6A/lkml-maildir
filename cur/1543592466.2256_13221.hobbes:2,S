Not really, and especially for a slow interface like ps2esdi :-)
There's a small optimization possible for ps2esdi I see, but the chance
of it happening in real life is probably pretty slim. Even if you can't
do sg and you can't have more than one command pending, you could still
be lucky and do I/O to more than ->buffer provided that bh1 and bh2 etc
are contigous in memory. For a 4kB fs the chances are close to 0 that
this will happen once the system has been up for a little while (and
memory starts to fragment). For a 1kB fs the chances are probably
bigger.
If I were you, I'd leave it the way it is now. As long as you work on
current_nr_sectors, the only thing that Paul's patch will accomplish is
make the queue smaller. It will buy you nothing.
