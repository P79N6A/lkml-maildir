Unfortunately you're wrong.  Some manufacturers have gotten rapped for 
marketing equipment that can be modded by stuff like desoldering diodes.
The FCC has some incredibly heavy-weight regulations, like:
- Problem: unlicensed high-power CB operation
- Solution: ban amplifiers that work anywhere near the CB band, 
including several amateur radio bands (even for sale to users with valid 
amateur licenses)
- Problem: unencrypted cell phones
- Solutions: ban scanners that work on the cell phone bands
... etc ...
