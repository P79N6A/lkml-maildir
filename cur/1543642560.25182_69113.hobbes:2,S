They are full of CRAP!
IBM ran TASKFILE IO throught there bus analyzers and it came up clean.
IBM also introduced FLAGGED versions of the diagnostic TASKFILE transport
for eventual use of their DFT (Drive Fitness Test).
You tell the service tech he is smoking crack.
The kernel passed with flying colors in their disk labs. If you read
in ide-taskfile.c version 0.33 and above, you will see they did some work
on the driver and verified issues.
Now earlier I published a method of how to stablize the drive once you
back up all the data you can off of it.  Since I do not yet have a source
verison of DFT-Linux, or binary yet, I can not offer much more native.
