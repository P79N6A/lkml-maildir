   Both with CONFIG_SMP, CONFIG_NR_CPUS=2, so almos whooping 2 pages! Almost
   one third of what CONFIG_SECURITY would add! ia32! Imagine on Sparc64! 8-P
BTW, you'll top that by just converting ip_statistics,
icmp_statistics, tcp_statistics, and net_statistics to
be per_cpu data :-)
Note that this would prevent ipv4 from being hacked into being
modular, but there are no plans at all to make modular ipv4 for 2.6.x
at all so this is a valid transformation/cleanup.
kernel/timer.c's main data structures desperately want to be per-cpu
or allocated at boot time also.  It, as has been noted often on this
list, is actually more bloat than the ipv4 statistics stuff. :-)
