Hi Mark,
In the kernel 2.4.17, ide.c makes an assumption that
CompactFlash cards and their brethern don't have a
slave unit.  Unfortunately, I have two that can do
master/slave and get caught since they are side by
side: (1) CompactFlash on an IDE/ATA adapter (as
master)and (2) Simple Tech Flash disk (as slave).
I patched the following to get it to work:

                        return 1;       /* yes, it is a flash memory card */
                }
Could the assumption be re-evaluated?  Am I going to
get into trouble doing this?
Regards.
