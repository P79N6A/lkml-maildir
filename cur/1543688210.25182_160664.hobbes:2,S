Hi,
since in the 2.6 tree the keyboard layout changed there are several
(well known and discussed) issues with the japanese keyboard layout and
the Yen/bar(pipe) key. I can ship around that problem in the shell with
'setkeycodes 0x6a 124', but in Xfree the xmodmap doesn't take this over
of course. The whole box was compiled against a 2.4.20-ck6.
So my question is: do I have to recompiled XFree against the 2.6
sources, or is there any XFree keymap changes I can do to get the
Yen/bar key back?
