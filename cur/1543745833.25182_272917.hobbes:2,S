Subject: [PATCH] add list_del_head function

Hi all,
I was working with some queues the other day and I noticed that there
was a list_add_tail() function in list.h, but no list_del_head()
function. This struck me as a little odd, so I went ahead and
implemented one in order to complete full queue functionality. The
patch below was generated against pristine 2.6.9 kernel.org kernel
sources and is attached to this email.
Please CC me on any replies, as I'm not subscribed to LKML. Thanks :)
Name: Add list_del_head for full queue functionality
Status: Tested
