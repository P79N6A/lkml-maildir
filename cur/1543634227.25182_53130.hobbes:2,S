I take issue with the statement that select scales fine to thousands of 
file descriptors.  It doesn't.  For fairly trivial workloads it degrades 
to 0 operations per second with more than a few dozen filedescriptors in 
the array, but only one descriptor being active.  To sustain decent 
throughput, select needs something like 50% of the filedescriptors in an 
array to be active at every select() call, which makes in unsuitable for 
things like LDAP servers, or HTTP/FTP where the clients are behind slow 
connections or interactive (like in the real world).  I've benchmarked 
it -- we should really include something like /dev/epoll in the kernel 
to improve this case.
Still, I think the bitmap approach in this case is useful, as having 
affinity to multiple CPUs can be needed, and it is not a frequently 
occuring operation (unlike select()).
