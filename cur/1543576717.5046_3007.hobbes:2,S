I can get this to happen reliably:
kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for xntpd...
kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for klogd...
last message repeated 15 times
kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for tail...
last message repeated 15 times
kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for init...
last message repeated 15 times
kernel: VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for vmstat...
...
etc.
It happens when swap gets full (I have 32 MB swap); I have a particular
program that thrashes the system (balanced binary tree searching) so
there's heavy swapping going on.  Once, running 2.2.18pre23, this happened
when I wasn't looking, and when I came back the system was dead -- I'm not
sure what the message means or how long it could survive after that, but I
run apmd/noflushd, and the disk & screen were powered down.  I got the
disk to spin back up, but nothing else happened.  I just made
do_try_to_free_pages fail again under 2.2.18, but I quit & rebooted before
anything else happened.
Can enough do_try_to_free_pages failures do that?  Are they supposed to
happen at all?  Do I need to configure some out-of-memory thing?
