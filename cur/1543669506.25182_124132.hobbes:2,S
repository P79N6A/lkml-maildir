Well maybe you should fix the other ports, because they aren't required
to flush that data and you may get burned nastily from it.
Also understand _why_ the policy is the way it is. Flushing mapped files
is bad for performance of the app. Its also useless for most apps
because there are no ordering guarantees implied by it.
If you have a case that needs it all you have to do is fork/clone a 
thread which does the needed msync's. If we enforce broken behaviour on
applications they cant fork a thread to stop the msyncs...
