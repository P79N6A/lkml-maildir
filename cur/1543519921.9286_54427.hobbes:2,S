That statement may be wrong. My config produced the APIC errors with a
2.3.x kernel
so I quickly went back to a 2.2.x kernel. When people say their config
is stable,
I would like to know which kernel they are running.
From what I've been reading in this list, I suspect the BP6 design is
flaky. I
reckon abit were a bit too agressive with the design but put it onto the
market anyway.
There is a disclaimer in the manual about the board not being intended
to run
multiple CPUs - maybe it's not just to appease Intel, but to let abit
off the hook if customers go back to them claiming it doesn't run two
CPUs
reliably.
