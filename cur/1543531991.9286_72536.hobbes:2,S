	No, this is a bandwidth control device that is munging packets
with certain data in the options field.  If I understood the original
discussion in the postfix mailing list, packets passing through the BW
manager with certain options set, get munged such that the outgoing
packet from the BW controller has said options included in the DATA
area of the packet.  This of course causes breakage, when the BW
manager leaks control data into the payload.
