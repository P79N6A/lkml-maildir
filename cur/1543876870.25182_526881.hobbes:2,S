Disagree. There are lots of good reasons you need to know which
port/which card/which slot/which multiplexor.
There is a world of a difference between a serious serial port
application and "wtf has my console gone"

Define "first". First by I/O order, by PCI scan order (and which type),
does ACPI come before or after ISA etc...
At the moment we sort of magic this for the PC by having hardcoded probe
order hacks by address, on the sparc by having other driver magic, on the
PPC by hardcoding some rules etc then hack the result to be ttyS0.
I've no fundamental problem with S0->console port 1, S1 -> console port 2
etc, but the general notion that type and positional information doesn't
matter is complete and utter bollocks when you try and apply it to any
serious serial setup.
