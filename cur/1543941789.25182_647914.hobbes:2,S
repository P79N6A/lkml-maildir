Subject: [PATCH] Remove Barcelona Thermal Throttling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

All,
You can imagine my dismay when I recently learned that, after all our
collective effort, hardware thermal throttling does not work reliably
on Barcelona, according to AMD.  Due to NDA restrictions, I am unable
to provide further details.
But the effort has not been a waste; whenever AMD manages to make a
reliable hardware thermal sensor, this code should "just work" along
with all the other northbridge initialization associated with the
device IDs in k8_northbridges[].
This patch Blacklists Barcelona as non-hardware-thermal-throttlable
(in addition to RevF, which was already blacklisted).  On the
recommendation of my colleagues, it also contains these politeness
enhancements: (1) warns the user if the CPU is _not_ blacklisted, but
the BIOS neglected to enable thermal throttling (as a safety measure)
and (2) uses the PCI_SLOT macro instead of the more obnoxious
shift-right-by-3 to compute PCI device numbers.
This patch assumes that it is being applied _after_ my previous patch
has already been integrated.  I mailed out that patch on 1/17/2008
with subject "Re: [PATCH] AMD Thermal Interrupt Support".
