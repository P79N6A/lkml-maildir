Thank you very much. This somewhat contradicts what i saw (and outlined
in usnet article), namely the mplayer+/dev/rtc case. Unless ofcourse
/dev/rtc interrupt is considered to be the same as the interrupt from
PIT (on X86 that is)
P.S. Perhaps it worth documenting this in the documentation? I caused
      me, and perhaps quite a few other people, a great deal of pain and
      frustration.
