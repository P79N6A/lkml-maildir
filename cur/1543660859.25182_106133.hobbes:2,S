You'll never send an engineer out to replace a set-top-box. You'll just wait 
for the customer to return the box and send out a new one. Software doesn't 
fail on those - it's some 99.9% hardware failure. If you get a hang or panic 
or something, the boxes usually have watchdogs to take care of that (and then 
reboot automatically). The average computer-frightened user getting an STB 
from the VoD/IPTV company (or her ISP) don't want to see any kernel 
gibberish. They just want a nice splash screen telling them "everything's 
gonna be alright in 45 seconds" or something. Trouble shooting is done in the 
lab after the box is returned
