proc_create() needs to check that the name of an entry to be created
does not contain a '/' character.
To test, I hacked the ibmveth driver to try to call request_irq with a
bogus "foo/bar" devname.  The creation of the /proc/irq/1234/xxx entry
silently fails, as intended.  Perhaps the irq code should be made to
check for the failure.
