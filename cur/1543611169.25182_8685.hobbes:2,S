That's the correct behavior. Quoting "man mount":
       grpid or bsdgroups / nogrpid or sysvgroups
              These options define what group id a newly  created  file
gets.   When
              grpid  is  set,  it  takes the group id of the directory in
which it is
              created; otherwise (the default) it takes the fsgid of the
current pro-
              cess,  unless  the  directory  has the setgid bit set, in
which case it
              takes the gid from the parent directory, and also gets the
setgid  bit
              set if it is a directory itself.
