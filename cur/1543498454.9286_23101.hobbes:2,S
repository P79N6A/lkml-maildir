Let's see: assume that we have a set of k 4-letter words W1,..,Wk, such
that prefixes are different from suffixes. Probability that random file of
length N doesn't contain any those words satisfies the following equation:
P(N) = P(n-1) - P(n-4) * k/2^32, P(0)=P(1)=P(2)=P(3). Obviously P(2^32/k)
is less than 1/2. Producing the set with k>20 is left as an exercise for
bored^Wcurious reader. Conclusion: probability that 200Mb of archives will
*not* contain, erm, profanities is less than 1/2 (actually I'ld expect 
it to be about 0.2--0.3 - generating larger set of 4-letter swearwords is
not too hard).
BTW, ever did strings /usr/lib/libm.a? Great for scaring the shit of
conspiracy theorists, especially ones of 'hidden subliminal messages'
persuasion.
