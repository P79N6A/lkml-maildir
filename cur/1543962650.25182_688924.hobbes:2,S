No, definitely not.
That said, I think that in order to not break other architectures, and to 
make it even easier to do this transformation, how about we just mark the 
generic version with __weak?
That way, odd architectures can just continue to call their own versions 
"sys_pipe()", and we don't break them unnecessarily.
