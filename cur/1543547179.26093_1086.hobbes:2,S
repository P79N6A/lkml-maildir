*bzzzt* Wrong.
Things marked as modular _do_ affect the current kernel. A lot. Granted, most
drivers don't, but things such as IPv6 or the netfilter code affect the in
kernel datastructures in a significant way.
Therefore, if this is going to be used to compile external modules against, 
and it will, you need the "M" options as well.
(I agree that the "N" things are obvious and easy to reconstruct though)
