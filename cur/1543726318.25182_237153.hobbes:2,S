That could well be <grin>.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
I figured that replacing the #define's with local variables
was worth a couple of style points, and that explicitly
checking that the user provided values were within limits,
all the time, no ifdefs, was more straight forward.
But it is difficult to establish such preferences with certainty.
Again, thanks for considering my reply.
Do as you think best.  I am afraid I have no more wisdom (if
ever I had any ...).
