Hey All,
I am working with Dawson Engler's meta-compillation group @ stanford.
Sorry if this is reposted, previous one seemed to get tied up.
Here is a patch to the drivers/net/wan/lmc/lmc_main.c file.
On line 503, the authors use the GFP_KERNEL argument to kmalloc, how
ever
they are holding a spin lock during this period.  They should use
GFP_ATOMIC here.
On line 510, the authors rely on a macro, LMC_COPY_FROM_USER which is
designed to work with stack memory, not heap memory.  In all other cases
it is fine, here however, the memory must be deallocated before -EFAULT
can be returned.  Note that this is a potential security hole as it is
leaking memory and can be exploited by passing bogus pointers to
copy_to_user - thus creating a DOS situation.
