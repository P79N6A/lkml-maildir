Subject: Temporary menuconfig file not removed by make mrproper

linux/scripts/lxdialog/lxtemp.c was left behind after hitting <ctrl-c>
during a make menuconfig. clean, distclean and mrproper all failed to
remove it.
Not sure how this could be handled for the general case; is there a
standard "this is a temporary file" tag that could be used so that
clean/mrproper would catch arbitrary temporary files? ie lxtemp~~.c or
similar.
