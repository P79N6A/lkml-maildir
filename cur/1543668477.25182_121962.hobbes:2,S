I am running 2.5.66-bk5 on an thinkpad t21. This model has BIOS
suspend to disk function that is independent from the OS. (I think
that this is implemented as S3BIOS in ACPI)
I am using the laptop with apm, and whenever i hibernate to disk and
resume, i get the following in dmesg:
uhci-hcd 00:07.2: suspend to state 3
