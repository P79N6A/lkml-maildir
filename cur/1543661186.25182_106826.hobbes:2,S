Well, you appear to be taking the superset of opinions, which is 
guaranteed to generate a paradox, I should think ;-)
Specifically regarding kconf, it does not require Qt; Qt is merely an 
optional piece.
For Perl, yes I personally think it is needed anyway.  And re-creating 
Perl's features in C, just to avoid Perl, is not the best technical 
solution when developers already have Perl installed.
