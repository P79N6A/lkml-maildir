Well, I'd certainly love to see some usable linux cell phones. 
(Well, one such beast in my pocket would probably be enough :-)
(Is there a way to make linux cell phone without second
cpu just for GSM stack?)
Comments about pramfs: RAM is not really random access,
you'll find that doing byte-sized random reads is way slower
than linear read,
but you are right that it is very different from disk.
How do you handle powerfail in the middle of write?
Do you run fsck or do you have some kind of logging?
