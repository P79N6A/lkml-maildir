OK, in this trace, both controllers are on the same bus. The broken
one has 'Capabilities: [100] Advanced Error Reporting' the other
does not have, and the bridge to this bus has two more capabilities :
'Capabilities: [100] Virtual Channel' and 'Capabilities: [180] Unknown (5)'.
I don't know whether it can jutify a different behaviour. Also, maybe this
is caused by a minuscule difference in the BIOS setup ?
