- David Howells' patch has a lot of special cases, a keyring isn't just
another registered keytype, whereas I use a flexible enough keytype
system that "keyrings" are normal keys with a key->type pointer to
struct key_type keyring_type = { ... };
- David Howells' patch isn't built to really allow processes to safely
share keys with each other, whereas I have a separate type called
"struct key_handle" that can be copied and still properly revoked.
(All the copies of the handle are revoked when the handle itself  is
revoked, but not the one that created said handle)

Right now it's still kind of like the scheduler stuff, it's easy to 
write
your own version, so there are a couple people maintaining their
own code to try out new ideas.  Personally I am not quite happy
with the architecture of some parts of David Howells' code, and I
wanted more architectural freedom so I started my own patch. In
a couple weeks or so I'll be done fooling around in my own little
world trying out ideas and maybe have some reasonably decent
patches.
I'll be gone next week, but I hope to continue this discussion
when I get back.
Cheers,
