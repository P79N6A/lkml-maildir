*************************
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address

current->tss.cr3=001010000, %cr3=00101000
......
Aiee, killing interupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempting to kill iddle task!
In interupt handler - not syncing.
*************************
Same was with "swapper task"
This happened with SMP (2 proc) kernel quite soon - 
with 2.2.9 on boot time
with 2.2.6 at uptime~10 minutes.
Nothing similar with uniproc kernel. 
My box has SCSI aic7880 that can be the source of troubles. Nothing
special more..
