Here's another posting to the list which mentions problems with NE2K and BP6:
http://web.gnu.walfield.org/mail-archive/linux-kernel/2000-August/0132.html
"...In another machine, a dual celeron abit-bp6, recent 2.3.x kernels seem to 
dislike my realtek 8029 NIC. (I know, it's garbage plugged in to 
garbage...) The network card will die randomly, usually when I'm sending 
large amounts of data. When it dies, there are no kernel messages, and 
the interrupt count in /proc/interrupts for the card stop changing. Minor 
(painful) experimentation has shown that if the card is sharing the 
interrupt with anything else (say, ide2), it takes that with it. This 
only happens in "newer" kernels, it's fine in 2.2.16, and in some earlier 
2.3.x kernels. It goes away if I boot with the noapic=1 kernel parameter, 
and seems to be replaced with harmless "spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7." 
messages. (I haven't configured any hardware at all to be on IRQ7 - 
though I'm lead to believe IRQ7 has some sort of special purpose) ..."
So I'm not the only one...
Cheers//Frank
