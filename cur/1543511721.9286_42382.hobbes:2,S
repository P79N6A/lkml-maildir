May be Microsoft wants to force targets on the linux development and play
in their own ground. Better get on with what we are doing.

OK, so Microsoft has thrown down the gauntlet. Some of the things they say
are completely untrue ("Security on linux is all-or-none", apparently they
never heard of "sudo" before), but some of the issues they bring up are
valid.
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable in the matter should prepare a detailed
response?
