I am working on an embedded PowerPC project.  Since I rolled my own 
bootloader, I don't have the Open Firmware prom on my board.  I need to 
know what the kernel is expecting when it makes calls into the prom.  I 
assume it is looking into the device tree (which I have to figure out 
too) and maybe returning info.
Is there any documentation out there for what these calls are doing?  i 
am getting the IEEE doc for Open Firmware, but from what I have seen it 
is at a higher level, and I need the guts of the procedures.
