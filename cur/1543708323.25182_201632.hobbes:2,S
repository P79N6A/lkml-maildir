At first glance, why are you using text strings as part of your bus ids?
Bus ids must be unique, so it looks like you can do this by just using
the number after the '@' character, right?
Then, within each device on the bus, you can give it a "name" or "type"
if you want.  You can put the "l-lan", "rtc", "vty*" stuff there, and
not encode it in the bus id (which is not where it belongs.)

Do you mean /drivers/char?  Not really anyone directly.  Do you have
some char drivers that need to get added there?  What type of drivers
are they?
thanks,
