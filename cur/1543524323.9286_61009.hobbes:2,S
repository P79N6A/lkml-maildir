Some of the kernel exported symbols allows to acces files (open.c : filp_open, filp_close). However,  the 'generic_file_read' function (filemap.c) seems to be restricted to buffers located in user space (access_ok macro)
 (which prevents it from being called by a kernel module). 
I would like to know the reason of this restriction which seems to be arbitrary as 
bypassing the check don't affect the function behavior.
thanks for your answers
