The prefetch however might still need some work - we can indeed do
prefetch() against a not-possible CPU's memory here.  And I do recall that
4-5 years ago we did have a CPU (one of mine, iirc) which would oops when
prefetching from a bad address.  I forget what the conclusion was on that
matter.
If we do want to fix the prefetch-from-outer-space then we should be using
cpu_isset(cpu, *cpumask) here rather than cpu_possible().
