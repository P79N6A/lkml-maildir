Christoph, could you explain why this is being added now and how it
compares to CML1 and/or CML2?
kbuild 2.[45] is completely agnostic about how .config and autoconf.h
are built, the only requirement is that .config be internally
consistent before it goes into the main build phase.  I don't care how
.config is built, but I do want to understand why another version of
CML is being developed.
