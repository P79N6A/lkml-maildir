could you speak to the specific case of function signatures ?
I saw nothing in CodingStyle specifically about this.
(I skimmed, and grepped for signature)
forex:
static ssize_t
store_fan_div (struct device *dev, struct device_attribute *devattr,
                    const char *buf, size_t count)
{...}
IIRC, many like the entire sig on one line, because its grep friendly.
I personally like the above, but grep-ability is hard to argue against.
The above has 2 violations (of strict-grep-ability rule)
1 - return sig is separate
2 - arg-list is split
