Subject: PROBLEM:  Network interface fails after RX packet count cycles back to zero

I have a problem which I think may originate in the kernel.
Below is the problem in the format recommended in the
REPORTING-BUGS file.
Thanks for your time.

----------------------------------------------------------------
[1.] One line summary of the problem:
Cannot read network interface after RX packet count cycles back
to zero.
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
My eth1 interface listens continuously to a busy link
in promiscuous mode.  At first ifconfig reports the
number of RX packets as steadily increasing.  Once this number
reaches 2147483647 (2^31-1) after about 6 days it stops
increasing and remains constant.  After another 6 days, presumably 
when 2^32 packets have passed by, the interface stops reading packets.  
The only solution I've found it to reboot the system.
This problem has happened regularly every 12 days or so and has repeated
at least half a dozen times.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
Network, promiscuous mode, ip, kernel
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.13 (root@bluet.ucc.uconn.edu) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 199903
14/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #2 SMP Mon Oct 25 13:40:24 EDT 1999         
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
         resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
No oops message.
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
         problem (if possible)
Try putting your interface into promiscuous mode on a busy link.
