It seems that someone has attempted to do O_NONBLOCK in fs/pipe.c.
ie:
        if (filp->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK) {
                if (PIPE_LOCK(*inode))
                        return -EAGAIN;
the code for O_ASYNC just hasn't appeared yet.
Since u never know when the reader will bother ( even if at all ) to read the
pipe, it would be expedient to the writer to not wait & not check at various
intervals. This is what SIGIO is ment to prevent.
