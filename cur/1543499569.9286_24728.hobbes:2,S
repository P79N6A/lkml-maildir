Subject: bug in filesystem busy detection in 2.2.x?

I have noticed several times with the 2.2.x series that filesystems are
reported busy even when no process has files open on that filesystem. Mostly
I notice this when shutting down the system, when the final umount fails
saying device is busy. This hasn't yet resulted in filesystem corruption.
System is celeron 333A, adaptec 2930U2, IBM DGVS09Y (9.1G ultra-wide scsi).
Currently kernel 2.2.10, but I've noticed this before as well.
