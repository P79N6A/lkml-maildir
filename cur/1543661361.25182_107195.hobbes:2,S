I can't get pppd to work on 2.5.59, it dies with :
"couldn't set tty to ppp discipline" 
I have everything compiled in the kernel (ppp_generic, ppp_async and the 
compression stuff) 
This only happens with the 2.5.59 kernel, not the 2.4.20 kernel...what am I 
doing wrong? 
Thanks for reading/replying.
