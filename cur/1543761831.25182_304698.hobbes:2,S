Works great here.  The i8k-cumulative patch claimed to be malformed, but
I merged it in just fine by hand.  In arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c, I had
to EXPORT dmi_get_system_info in order to get the i8k module to load.
That may have been a mistake on my end (lots of odd patches in my tree
right now).  I'm a little curious to see how many people are going to
find they need the ignore_dmi flag versus working without it.
Everything works great, and it is a big step up from the existing code.
 I say lets go with it.
