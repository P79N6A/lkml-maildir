I would really like a linux-patches@vger.kernel.org list that was
nothing but all the patches people planned to submit, with minimal

Things like the hugetlb crap might then not have gotten in

To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in
the body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.org
