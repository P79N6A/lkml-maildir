Subject: [patch] ramdisk blocksize Kconfig entry
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch makes the ramdisk blocksize configurable at kernel
compilation time rather than only at boot or module load time,
like a couple of the other ramdisk options.  I found this handy
awhile back but thought little of it, until recently asked by a
few of the testing folks here to be able to do the same thing
for their automated test setups.
The Kconfig comment is largely lifted from comments in rd.c,
and hopefully this will increase the chances of making folks
aware that the default value often isn't a great choice here
(for increasing values of PAGE_SIZE, even moreso).
