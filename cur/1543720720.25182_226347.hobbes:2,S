It does sometimes matter, because even these days we sometimes see a 
case where a brand name switch (like Cisco) and a brand name card 
(Intel, 3COM) negotiate but just don't "work right" later. In those 
cases forcing on both ends or just the NIC end results in a fully 
functional connection.
We usually do this with module parameters, but do use ethtool (or 
mii-tool) on occasion.

Yah.
Seeing this happen while autonegotiation is in progress is a small and 
unlikely window of course!
