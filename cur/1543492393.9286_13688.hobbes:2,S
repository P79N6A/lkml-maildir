Seems to be a bug in ping in potato -
netbase (3.14-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added iputils package. (provides ping6, traceroute6, and
    tracepath{,6})
  * ipdwadm-wrapper: Fixed thinko in helptext, and added check for
    /proc/net/ip_acct as well as /proc/net/ip_input to better check
    some ipfwadm (pre-2.1.x) systems. Thanks to Francesco Portorti.
    (Bug#34879,#34880,#34912,#35016)
  * /bin/ping: Recompiled with new fakeroot to fix weird group errors.
    (Bug#34994,#34998)
