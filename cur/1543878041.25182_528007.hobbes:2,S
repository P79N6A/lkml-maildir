sorry, i forgot to mention that you should turn off 
CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING.
i've attached an updated version of trace-it.c, which will turn this off 
itself, using a sysctl. I also made WAKEUP_TIMING default-off.

yeah, it's stack footprint measurement/instrumentation. It's 
particularly effective at tracking the worst-case stack footprint if you 
have FUNCTION_TRACING enabled - because in that case the kernel measures 
the stack's size at every function entry point. It does a maximum search 
so after bootup (in search of the 'largest' stack frame) so it's a bit 
verbose, but gets alot rarer later on. If it bothers you then disable:
  CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y
it could interfere with getting a quality scheduling trace anyway.

 * user-triggered tracing.
 *
 * The -rt kernel has a built-in kernel tracer, which will trace
 * all kernel function calls (and a couple of special events as well),
 * by using a build-time gcc feature that instruments all kernel
 * functions.
 *
 * The tracer is highly automated for a number of latency tracing purposes,
 * but it can also be switched into 'user-triggered' mode, which is a
 * half-automatic tracing mode where userspace apps start and stop the
 * tracer. This file shows a dumb example how to turn user-triggered
 * tracing on, and how to start/stop tracing. Note that if you do
 * multiple start/stop sequences, the kernel will do a maximum search
 * over their latencies, and will keep the trace of the largest latency
 * in /proc/latency_trace. The maximums are also reported to the kernel
 * log. (but can also be read from /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency)
 *
 * For the tracer to be activated, turn on CONFIG_EVENT_TRACING
 * in the .config, rebuild the kernel and boot into it. The trace will
 * get _alot_ more verbose if you also turn on CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACING,
 * every kernel function call will be put into the trace. Note that
 * CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACING has significant runtime overhead, so you dont
 * want to use it for performance testing :)
