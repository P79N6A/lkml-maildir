A further thought on this.  I think kgdb should take control on oops, panic and 
other bad news things.  This without being anthing but configured in.  Thus the 
command line options to set up the interface, etc, should not automatically 
connect to gdb.

I question the utility of ever using this message.  Either the user has asked 
for the connection, either via a ^C or the command line or a breakpoint was hit. 
  If he asked, why tell him?  If it is a breakpoint, it is foolish and dangerous 
to call any outside function, such as printk.
