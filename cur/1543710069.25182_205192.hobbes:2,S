I gave it a rethink today, and yes, we should preserve the starting
partial page as well. Doing so helps reducing unnecessary disk I/O for
any access pattern, and the kernel will behave more consistent and robust.
The only negative effect is, some useless pages are left to be freed at some
later time by the page replacement routines, and the cost of which is acceptable.
