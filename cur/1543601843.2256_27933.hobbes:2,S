Please don't send preempt bugs to Alan.  Only if the bug is reproducible
outside of the preempt patch should Alan see it.  Certainly send it to
the list, but make sure its marked as such.
You are the third person to report this problem.  The first person had
the problem go away when he mounted root on a non-ReiserFS partition, so
I blamed ReiserFS.  The second person had the problem go away when he
recompiled his kernel without Athlon optimizations.  So I am baffled.
You aren't using gcc-3, are you?
