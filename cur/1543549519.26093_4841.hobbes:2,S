Well, as they say around here ... "the source code is the documentation".
Basically, ioremap allocates some virtual memory, and then maps that memory to
the physical address you request.  It's intended for PCI memory, but you can
use it on normal memory is mark the pages reserved in the mem_map_t structures.
