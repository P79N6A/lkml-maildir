Look at your nearby gcc info entry.
Note that optimization levels beyond -O2 are _not_ recomended for the
kernel, on stock gcc/egcs -O3 and up enable automatic inlining, and part of
the kernel relies (mostly for performance, but sometimes also for
correctness) on certain functions _not_ to be inlined. Besides, this just
bloats the kernel for no good reason. pgcc is another matter, as the
meaning on the optimization levels was reworked there AFAIK.

No, it's a separate optimization that precludes debugging. That's why it is
a separate flag. OTOH, -fno-strength-reduce is a workaround for a bug in
gcc-2.7.2.x.
Please RTFMs!
