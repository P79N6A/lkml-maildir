Hi,
Your 2.6 network patchkits contained patches disassociating struct
net_device from struct hdlc_device in drivers/net/wan/hdlc_*
and in various hw WAN drivers. What is the status of this patch?
Is it still needed and while it was dropped as untested, should I
review/test it? It looks quite complete and reasonable I think.
