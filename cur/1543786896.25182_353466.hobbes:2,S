Can you please post something against new kernels you are patching
against _today_? I recall these same graphs from a few years back but
even iptables has improved since. 
Any issues you may find can only help you improve.
BTW, your tests were unfair to iptables; you should have had optimized
the rules with the assumption that someone needing that many rules would
probably have needed to do some optimization even with iptables.
Yes, it would only have taken one year to load 256K rules, but it would
have loaded eventually.

Very good. Please do more up to date testing and try to include tc
filter as well.
