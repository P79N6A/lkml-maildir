It's OK! These're 2 different warnings. As a matter of fact, my patch
wasn't supposed to fix any of them, but something similar to the first
one, which was possible, but for some reason wasn't reported by
lockdep.
The first warning was fixed by Andrew Morton's patch to free_irq(),
so it shouldn't happen in -rc3-mm. The second warning could have been
fixed too, I don't know, but since it's quite long, I would prefer to
think about it only if it still happens in current -mm's.
Thanks,
