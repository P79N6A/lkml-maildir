Could be so.  But we need to understand how significant the impact of this
will be in practice.
We could find, once this is deployed is real production environments on
large machines that the data loss is sufficiently common and sufficiently
serious that the feature needs a lot of rework.
Now there's always a risk of that sort of thing happening with all
features, but it's usually not this evident so early in the development
process.  We need to get a better understanding of the risk before
proceeding too far.
And there's always a 100% reliable fix for this: throttling.  Make the
sender of the messages block until the consumer can catch up.  In some
situations, that is what people will want to be able to do.  I suspect a
good implementation would be to run a collection daemon on each CPU and
make the delivery be cpu-local.  That's sounding more like relayfs than
netlink.
