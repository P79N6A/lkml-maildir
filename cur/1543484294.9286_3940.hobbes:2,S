Subject: 2.2.1ac3 cannot identify ESS1869

I applied 2.2.1ac3 patch, built new kernel and it cannot detect my ESS1869:
from /proc/sound:
OSS/Free:3.8s2++-971130

With 2.2.1 the idendtification was OK:

I've hardcoded ``esstype = 1869''  ;)
and rebuild modules - > the identification OK.
But I still have problem. ESS-1869 locks up my box.
If  I run mpg123 immediately after the boot then it will lock up after
2..11 secs.
I don't know why, but if I try to do some intensive work:
bzip2 a cdrom image, find the whole system with checking gzip -tv for all
.gz files
etc then i'm able to run mpg123. I noticed from `top' that in this case
swap memory is used.
If the load is high then mpg123 can continue to play files. When the load
is go down ESS will  lock up the box.
Some additional info:

Can someone help me to resolve the problem of locking up?
Is something wrong with my setup (isapnp.conf or config or the order of
loading modules or anything else?)
Or may be this is a problem with the sound driver or with dma?
Or may be this is a problem with my VIA PCI - ISA bridge?
If it is impossible to solve this problem by software then should I
consider the replacement of the soundcard.
If so then what sound card would you recommend: PCI? which one.
Or may be this case required more radical treatment like replacement
AMD-K6 with PC-100 (VIA) motherboard
  by
pentium II with BX motherboard?
Any advise would be highly  appretiated.

Alex
