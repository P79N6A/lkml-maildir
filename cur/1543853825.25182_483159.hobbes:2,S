If the X server is started manually on 2.6.14 and above with "startx &" 
and if you hit the enter key in the detached session,
the desktop will stop responding to keyboard and mouse events.
It's easy to reproduce.  Set to run level 3 on an ES4, then start the X 
server manually
and hit enter in the session from which you started the gnome desktop, 
and the X server
will stop responding to events, application startup, etc.
It's easisest to reproduce on ES4.
