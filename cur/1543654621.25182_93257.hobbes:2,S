Hi,
My Dec Alpha (Alcor) runs fine with 2.2.20.
With 2.4.20, it fails during boot at the init. of the scsi-devices.
Error is:
CACHE TEST FAILED: dma error (dstat=0xa0).sym0: CACHE INCORRECTLY CONFIGURED
I tried a kenel with: NCR53C8XX and SYM53C8XX compiled in, and I tried
a kernel with SYM53C8XX support neither of them work. Both give same error.
What can be the cause of this?
