I'm just thinking about something. While you can't cut bytes out of unix
iles a lot of filesystems can do this (holes). Most of them only on a
block boundary, reiser4 on a byte boundary. If the filesystems could
export this functionality using an enhanced API we could implement a
compression plugin and other things on the VFS level that works with
every filesystem supporting the required mechanisms, not only reiser4.
And those features would take advantage of reiser4's storage mechanisms.
I think Hans made the plugins reiser4-only because only reiser4 has a
similar API at that time (and obviously because he didn't even think
about doing it otherwise).

At the moment a file is exactly one object. But someone could write
another file plugin that spans a file across multiple objects, then yes,
multiple files could share parts.
