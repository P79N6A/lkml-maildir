Since you don't seem to have gotten an answer, and while this is 
probably the wrong list for your question, I can give you a pointer 
which may help.
The communications program "kermit" can do this, google for the source, 
or try kermit.columbia.edu first, and read the source to see how they do 
it. I'm reasonably sure ioctl() is the answer, but that's choice three 
for your research.
