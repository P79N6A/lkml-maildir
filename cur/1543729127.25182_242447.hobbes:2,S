For the record, this also seems to have affected growisofs.  Running it
setuid root doesn't help, since it drops privileges before burning
(and thus I imagine it now ends up dropping too many privileges...).
Would the correct plan of attack here be to send fixes to the authors
of the various media-burning tools to make sure that they keep
CAP_SYS_RAWIO when dropping privileges?  (Are any other capabilities
required?)
