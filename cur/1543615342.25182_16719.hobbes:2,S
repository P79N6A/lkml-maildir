Usually yes. But for a code that simply parses /dev/kmem content without 
taking args...
Just took a quick look at dmidecode.c and auditing this code doesn't 
seem out of reach.
What's the difference security-wise between running this code in kernel 
space and in a suid prog? Avoiding loading libraries?
Frankly I don't see the point.
