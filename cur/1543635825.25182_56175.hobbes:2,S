why not just call it 'linux'?  file(1) exists for a reason, and the 'vm'
prefix is a bit redundant these days
also i've never really understood why the binary format of the kernel is
selected via make.  why not just make it a regular kernel option with a
sane default?  surely your average kernel compiling person picks
something that works (zImage? bzImage? Image?) and sticks to it...
