Slow downs up to livelocks with large memory configurations.

Oh just run a 32GB SMP system with sparsely freeable pages and lots of 
allocs and frees and you will see it too. F.e try Linus tree and mlock 
a large portion of the memory and then see the fun starting. See also 
Rik's list of pathological cases on this.

Good to know that direct io works.

Rik is trying to solve the same issue in a different way. He is trying to 
manage gazillion entries better instead of reducing the entries to be 
managed. That can only work in a limited way. Drastic reductions in the 
entries to be manages have good effects in multiple ways. Reduce 
management overhead, improve I/O throughput, etc etc.
