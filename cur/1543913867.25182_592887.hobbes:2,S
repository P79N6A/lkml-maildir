Looks good in principle. My only suggestion would be to name it something
differently than vdir. I know that's what GNU make calls it, but it's still
pretty cryptic. How about just fallback-dir ? 
Also what would be nice (I don't know if it's doable in make) would
be a separate variable (e.g. other-obj-... := ) that contains the fallback
names and that is double checked against the fallback directory. That
would document it clearly what's going on. Failing that stuffing 
them into a comment would be good at least.
