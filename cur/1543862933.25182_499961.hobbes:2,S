Hi there,
Trying to mmap /dev/kmem with an offset I take from /boot/System.map, I 
get an EIO error on a 2.6.20-rc4.
This is something that used to work on older kernels.
Had a look at mmap_kmem() in drivers/char/mem.c, and I'm wondering 
whether pfn is correctly computed there: shouldn't we have something like
pfn = PFN_DOWN(virt_to_phys((void *)PAGE_OFFSET)) +
       __pa(vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT);
instead of
pfn = PFN_DOWN(virt_to_phys((void *)PAGE_OFFSET)) + vma->vm_pgoff;
Or may be should I substract PAGE_OFFSET from the value I get from 
System.map before mmapping /dev/kmem?
Thanks for your help
Regards,
Nadia
