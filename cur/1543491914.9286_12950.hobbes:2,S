Well, I did some testing and it seems to be related to the serial port I use.
My guess is that both the extra serial ports I installed are somehow using
the same IRQ although I've jumpered them to different IRQ's on the board.
I have two on-board serial ports (ttyS0/ttyS1), I now use the second for the
mouse instead of one of the extra ports (ttyS2) and the problem is gone. On
the fourth port I have a monitor/status display connected which is updated
every minute. I noticed the mouse 'lockups' to be in-sync with the updates of
this display. I used setserial to set the IRQ for the extra ports but I've
read that setserial doesn't work anymore with kernels > 2.2.x ? How does one
set the IRQ for these extra ports ? Or should the kernel autodetect them ?
The mouse now runs 'as smooth as silk' :)
