The basic logic you need is to add:
.PRECIOUS: header.h
Whenever you have a line like:
header.h : xxxx yyy zzz
	@touch header.h
This will keep prevent the headers from being killed.
Anything that .PRECIOUS depends on does not die if it it's rule fails.
Patching  mkdep.c is left as an exercise for the reader.
