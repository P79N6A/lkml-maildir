I had exactly the same symptoms (Unknown key pressed, scrolling) with a
Cherry PS/2 keyboard an a PS/2 mouse, starting with 2.6.0-test6 (i think).
The mouse also stopped working.
Unfortunatly it was a heisenbug - every time i tried to find out what caused
the problem (there where drivers/input/mouse* - changes at that time) the
problem disapeared. I then exchanged the mouse for a USB-type and the
problem disappeared completly.
