On what sample do you base this claim?
Generally hardware raid sooner or later makes problems (especially if you
run raid5 in degenerate mode or try to rebuild by disk replacing with
differen/old signature). Also bus hangs are commonly not very well received
by hw raid firmware or drivers.
Issues with software raid are usually quicker to spot.
