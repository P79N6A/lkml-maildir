I think page->flags use should be limited to things that are relatively
performance-sensitive and arch-independent, mostly because we're running
out of them on 32-bit platforms, fast.
Each incremental use of page flags doesn't have any immediate storage
cost, but it's a serious pain when we run out, and having to bloat it to
a 64-bit value on 32-bit platforms wouldn't be very memory efficient,
either. :)

Either that, or something like "Dynamically allocated pageflags" would
be nice.
