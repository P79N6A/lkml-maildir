> Free Linux Driver Development!
Just curious, it is a coincidence or a thoughtful action that this offer 
(which is undoubtedly very attractive and will definitely help the Linux 
user base grow) is published on the very same day when a well-known 
software giant releases a new Major Version of their closed-source 
operating system?
Thanks,
Dmitri
