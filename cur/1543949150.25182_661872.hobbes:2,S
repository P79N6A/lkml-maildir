Subject: sysctl in 2.6.24.2 excludes unapproved files from /proc/sys?

A change in 2.6.24.x kernel/sysctl.c seems to exclude exo-kernel drivers
from using the /proc/sys/ interface:

and IT TURNS OUT THAT (sorry, did I scream?) sysctl_check_table can't
succeed on anything that's now not been hardwired into the core kernel
because of the new sysctl_check.c file  which contains gazzilions of
explict tables aying what is supposed to be in there in excruciating
detail and which are consulted through sysctl_check_table and
sysctl_binary_lookup.  E.g:
static struct trans_ctl_table trans_random_table[] = {
        { RANDOM_POOLSIZE,      "poolsize" },
        { RANDOM_ENTROPY_COUNT, "entropy_avail" },
        { RANDOM_READ_THRESH,   "read_wakeup_threshold" },
        { RANDOM_WRITE_THRESH,  "write_wakeup_threshold" },
        { RANDOM_BOOT_ID,       "boot_id" },
        { RANDOM_UUID,          "uuid" },
        {}
};
It appears to me, not that I am totally sure because of the lack of
comments, that every attempt to add a new direcotry in the tree with
a number that is not listed in the above mess fails through
sysctl_binary_lookup.sysctl_binary_lookup, and every attempt to add
a directory with CTL_UNNUMBERED instead fails if it has children because
the children cry about having an unnumbered parent. Every attempt to
add a directory usurping an existing number fails through some string
mismatch against the trans_.._tables on the dirnames in one of the
numerous lookup functions (forget which).
(somebody has really spent their holidays on this).
What's a person to do?
