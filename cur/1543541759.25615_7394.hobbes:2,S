Actually, I consider this a feature.  It means that we can use samba to
export a filsystem to a NT machine and have samba not have to care if
it's ext2, NTFS or whatever providing the storage.  (Not really true
of course, on a HFS partition, the .AppleDouble/file automatically
get renamed if the main stream gets renamed).

IMHO, it's not tar as much as being compatible with most other Unix 
systems and working with NFS that's the problem.
It's mostely that I'd like to see something that would work on other
Unices too.
