1. The corrupted files have the same length but differ (I cannot say on what
bit-position)
2. I reproduced the problem while burning CD from SCSI-Disk to
SCSI-CD-Burner!!!
-> It´s definetly not a (single?) IDE-Problem
Burning CD (on slow 4x speed) seems to initialize many small transfers
(instead of a smooth stream)(same as copying many small files) on PCI/DMA wich
generate the same problems!!!
