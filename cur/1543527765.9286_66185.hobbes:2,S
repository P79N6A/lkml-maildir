Subject: PROBLEM: Cannot Compile Kernel 2.3.46 for PPC

1. Cannot Compile Kernel 2.3.46 (or many of the earlier ones) on the PPC
2. "make dep" works correctly, though when I try to "make vmlinux", make
returns many errors:
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/modules/ppc_ksyms.ver:168  
	warns '_machine' redefined
	(previous definition in /usr/src/linux/include/asm/processor.h:702) 
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/fs.h:755:
	warns implicit declaration of function 'abs'
/usr/src/linux/drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:256
	In function `blk_init_queue': structure has no member named
`back_merges_fn'
It is the last of these errors that causes compilation failure. I hope
that this is sufficient information to give you an idea as to the
problem(s). [I used the default configuration for this test -- straight
out of xconfig].
3. Keywords: Compilation Error
4. Kernel version: (Running 2.2.12 patched for Macintosh Powerbook G3)
Many thanks for your great services.
