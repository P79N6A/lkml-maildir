Why add a new fakephp if you want to remove it right after that?

It's a long fight between me and Greg about fakephp. I wrote dummyphp, fakephp 
is a for of an early version of dummyphp that I never liked. So if anyone 
comes up with "fakephp can not do $foobar" my first answer is "try dummyphp". 
So if you want to remove fakephp I'm the first do support you *eg* Yes, this 
probably is mostly personal taste and not so much technical, but I'm just 
human ;)
