Which is why a UP kernel can schedule on both sides of an HT core.
Yeah, I got it now. ;)
An HT core still *has* "the other instruction stream" it can schedule
differetly.  You can't say "We'll schedule this one this way and that other
one that way" when there *is* no "that other one".
(And if you look at the current code, you'll realize that HT is conceptually
different from both UP *and* MP - go look at the places where the *current*
scheduler is HT-aware, and how that was a big win over when it thought each
HT was a fully capable MP......)
