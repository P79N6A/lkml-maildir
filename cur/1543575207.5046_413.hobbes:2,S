	This ALSA-based Yamaha PCI driver does not have the changes
from ALSA that were necessary to make it run on the Transmeta-based
Sony PictureBooks, right?  I tried the driver in 2.4.0-test12pre7,
and that driver with Pavel's patch, and that driver with Pavel's
patch with "#include <linux/config.h>, #undef CONFIG_SMP", and
got the same behavior in all three cases:
	Loading the module would cause a very loud monotone
squeal, like some kind of theft detection device.  The computer
would still work while it was sqealing, but sync'ing the discs
would never return.  rmmod'ing the module would cause a second
noise to be superimposed on the first, one that sounded like a
worn down fan or the purr that some BIOS'es make when they are
testing RAM.
	If this version does not have whatever changes were
need for the Transmeta-baed Picturebook, then never mind.
If it is not some obvious oversight, I guess I will try installing
ALSA and comparing the drivers.
