Problem is that almost all all ISA cards fall into 'unprepared' category,
unable to share interrupts with another card. ISA IRQ sharing allways was the
risky bussiness, depending on electrical characteristics of both IRQ sharing 
devices.

It's exactly my point beyond the ugly quirk which disables ISA IRQ sharing.

Reverse enginerring of the PCB layout is not acceptable for allmost all users 
of ISA PnP boards :)
