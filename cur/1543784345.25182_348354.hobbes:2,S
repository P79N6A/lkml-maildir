Avoiding it isn't necessary, a config option to read a variable 
THREAD_SIZE would solve this part of it. I looked at the implications of 
this, and other than a slight overhead it looks as if the problem is 
where to put the size :-( I think it could be done given that all 
threads of a process would have the same size, but I am *not* suggesting 
that it should be done.

Have to agree, it would take way more effort than it's worth, given that 
the need can be avoided by allowing user config of the stack size. It 
does look relatively easy to allow larger stack sizes, though. Wasn't 
there one driver so ill-behaved it wouldn't even run in an 8k stack?
Andi made the point that allocating server size memory in 4k blocks 
results in a lot of them, resulting in increased overhead in some 
places. Thinking about configuring the stack size, maybe it would be 
useful to make memory allocation block size independent of the hardware 
and let both be set over a wide range in config.
