It's my understanding that one of the reasons that one would use a
tmpfs for the /tmp directory is because by definition it would start
out "clean" upon reboot.  By definition this would be the same reason
you wouldn't want to use it for the rest of the system -- you'd have to
reinstall your whole OS every time you rebooted.
Others have mentioned that a "good" use of such a system would be for
diskless stations, so that they would not have to transfer "temporary"
files over the 'net because they didn't have local disk storage...
