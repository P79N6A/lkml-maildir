Some RTCs implement only 64 bytes of NVRAM, with bytes 64-127 mapping back
to 0-63.  That way, you could not only write the NVRAM, but make the RTC
generate interrupts (which we use as timer interrupts on some Alphas), set
the system time or cause alarms as soon as you'd have write access to the
NVRAM.  AFAIK there is no way to autodetect the size of the NVRAM.
