Obviously I was a bit optimisitic in accepting the notion that distros
had already upgraded their userland bits to handle WE-21.  I apologize.
As Dan points-out, it will be a while before distros (other than
Fedora rawhide and equivalents) have 2.6.19 kernels for general
users.  For now, those experiencing this issue should be comfortable
experiencing some breakage...?
So, is the window between now and the release of 2.6.19 big enough
to give the distros time to get wireless-tools and wpa_supplicant
into their update streams?  Or do we need to go through the pain of
reverting/delaying WE-21?
