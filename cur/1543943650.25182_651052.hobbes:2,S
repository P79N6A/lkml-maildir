that's sort of a rabbit-and-the-frog problem. The 32 bit emulator tries to
look EXACTLY like the 32 bit kernel, and it really should.
If someone wants a method to detect even that... we would really want
to know the exact usecase.. because very likely it's the wrong answer
to some other problem ;-)
