Subject: [patch] NCR5380.c fix

Several SCSI drivers confuse CHECK_CONDITION and CHECK_CONDITION << 1.
One of them is NCR5380.c. Below a patch adding status_byte() twice.
(On the other hand, sun3_NCR5380.c does this right, and generally
looks better. Maybe they can be merged eventually.)

(This was for 2.5.68. I think 2.5.69 will differ by 1 line.)
