It's not the indirection count that I worry about.
It's the scalability of the locking.  We must avoid as
much as possible adding any global locks on key code paths.
This means:
 1) be reluctant to add them to fork/exit
 2) just RCU locks on per-job (or finer grain) data when on
	the normal page allocation path
 3) nothing outside the current task context for the normal
	task scheduling code path.
A global lock on the wrong code path is fatal for scaling
big NUMA boxes.
... now whether or not that is an issue here, I don't claim
to know.   I'm just worried that it could be.
Atomic data, such as global counters, is just as bad.
