What? You can't really influence it.

Using a filesystem with aggressive caching.

See one above. Set /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio high to have the flush taking 
place late, or low to have it "early+often".

It all boils down to the same: read the file and write it back. So all 
your methods cost equally much. With splice() instead of read/write 
however, you may save some cycles.
>something else?  That's with recent kernels, of course.
