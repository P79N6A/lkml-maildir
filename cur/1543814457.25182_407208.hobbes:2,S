I tend to say "high-order" when I ought to say ">0-order":
anything over 0-order exhibits the same problem, needing __GFP_COMP.

Just pass __GFP_COMP whatever the order of the request is.  In the case
of 0-order requests, it'll simply be ignored (so you don't _need_ to pass
it in that case, but it's just a waste of effort to avoid it): that page
won't be marked PageCompound, nor will it need to be - most of the time
(;)) we have no difficulty holding a single page together with itself.
The whole thing of having to pass __GFP_COMP is a nuisance, and caught
me by surprise.  Looking back at the history, it seems that when compound
pages were first introduced (by akpm), it wasn't necessary at all: asking
for a >0-order page gave you a compound page.  But then a few places
surfaced which went badly wrong that way, I think somewhere in ARM and
a couple of drivers, places which split the >0-page up again.  Perhaps
one day we should go in search of those exceptions, fix them up (maybe
Nick already did so with his split_page in -mm?), and eliminate the
need for a __GFP_COMP flag.

Okay, fine: I didn't mean to discourage you from using VM_DONTCOPY if
it suits, I just didn't understand why Andrew was promoting its use.

Yes, all kernels from 2.4.0 through 2.6.15: a bit was defined for it,
and a motley collection of drivers set that bit, but it wasn't used
for anything at all - not even any files in /proc.  A leftover from 2.2.

You're safe to drop the VM_SHM everywhere.  But your backport driver will
have to be using PageReserved still, not relying on __GFP_COMP: although
__GFP_COMP was defined in 2.6.9 and a few earlier, it used to take effect
only when #ifdef CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE - only in 2.6.15 did we make it
available to all configurations.  You'll have irritating accounting
differences between the two drivers: it used to be the case that put_page
on a PageReserved page did nothing, so you had to avoid get_page on it to
get the page accounting right; we straightened that out in 2.6.15.

I believe uverbs_mem.c sets a good example if you want to follow it
in detail; but I think it's the only driver which does all that.
Most drivers hold a certain number of pages pinned, and even if they
make them available to userspace, we still consider them driver pages
and exempt them from locked_vm accounting.  But (as I understand it)
uverbs_mem.c makes it possible for userspace to pin down an otherwise
unlimited number of user pages for an indefinite length of time: so
they've chosen to enforce locked_vm accounting, and I applaud that.
So, if your driver allows userspace to pin an otherwise unlimited
number of user pages for an indefinite length of time, you ought
to follow uverbs_mem.c's locked_vm accounting.  But if it's only
a little, briefly, don't bother.
And I'll have confused you by mentioning that under VM_LOCKED:
I was thinking uverbs_mem.c set VM_LOCKED, but it does not, nor
should it.  Nor should you, neither at your get_user_pages, nor
when setting up your vmas (if you search the kernel source, I
think you'll find a few drivers which do set VM_LOCKED, but
they're just wrong, and it's one of the things I have to fix
when I do that trawl through them all).
