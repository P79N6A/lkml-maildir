Any reason not to push Zhang's fixes for 2.6.25?
I also have a patch I want to push for 2.6.25 to deal with the powerpc  
device tree.  I was going to handle this via the powerpc tree's since  
that seems to be the model we have used for netdev and other drivers  
that play with arch/powerpc.  I hope that's not an issue (I'll CC you  
on the patch).
