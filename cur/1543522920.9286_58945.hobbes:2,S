Im not sure 2.2.13->14 is the change, its certainly involved. The drivers/stack
havent all changed, its not a driver issue. 2.2.13 also certainly shows parts
of the behaviour.
If you think the swapping diffs from 2.2.14aa1 will help then let me know
where to grab just the needed bits and we'll try it for 2.2.15pre4.
