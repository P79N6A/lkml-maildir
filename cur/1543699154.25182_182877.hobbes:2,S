You are of course totally wrong - just because a device is present in the 
system doesn't mean that it's kernel modules are loaded - for example my 
floppy is always present in the system, but I access it like once a month 
or so - currently devfs (which I'm using on 3 computers with no problems 
for over a year now) will load the floppy module on access to /dev/fd0 and 
the module will unload automatically a few dozen minutes later after I'm 
done with the disk drive. On an 8 MB mem system keeping 60KB floppy 
driver non-stop in unswappable kernel memory is wastefull.  Especially 
since this also applies to microcode, sound drivers, scanners, rtc, etc...  
The system is properly configured - the modules for devices are loaded 
when needed - just because a device is present doesn't mean we need to 
have the driver loaded for it.
