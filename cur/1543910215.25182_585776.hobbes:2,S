You shouldn't need to do that manually, simply go into "make
menuconfig", enter the "Kernel hacking" menu and select the "Kernel
debugging" and "Compile the kernel with debug info" options.
You may also want to enable "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
and various other options in that menu to get more debug info.
