No, I don't.  I've never said we can _eliminate_ bugs and please don't make
things look as though I did.

That's not a level of discussion I'm used to, sorry.

Not necessarily trying to find bugs in them, but trying to understand how the
patched code is supposed to work and if that's really what we want.
I really think we should review each other's code more, but I do realize that
people don't do it.  Of course, I'm digressing.

I'm not sure if you find it productive, but whatever.
A general rule that the trees people want you to pull during a merge window
should be tested in linux-next before, with no additional last minute changes,
may help.
For this to work, though, the people will have to know in advance when the
merge window will start.  Which may be helpful anyway.
Thanks,
