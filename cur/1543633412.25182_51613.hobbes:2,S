If it *were* all contained in ifconfig, you'd be right, but that isn't  
even remotely true.
There are a *huge* number of programs that know about network interfaces.  
Apart from ifconfig, we have route, routed, iptables, ip, bootloads of  
admin scripts for device configuration, for firewalling, pppd anmd  
scripts, arp, dhcpd, portsentry, and I haven't even really scratched the  
surface here.
Sure, in the old times, when you could get Unix(tm) with or without the  
"networking option" for extra money, there wasn't much. But that has  
dramatically changed in these Internet times.
