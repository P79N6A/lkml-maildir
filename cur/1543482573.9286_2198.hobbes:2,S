"stuff"?  Like corrupting the coredump?  Doesn't seem to be the height of
problems.  I think at worst you could corrupt the content of the file, but
you can't make it start writing to the wrong place.

Yeah, I agree.  I wrote it quite a while ago, and it hasn't gotten any prettier
since.
I think you've misread the macro stuff, ugly though it is.  There's two
definitions of DUMP_SEEK and DUMP_WRITE.  The first returns, but its used in a
context where that's OK.  The second does a goto close_coredump on error, which
does the write thing with regard to segments and other cleanup.
Its clearly not the coredump code which is causing problems though - it looks
like exec of a core file is the problem, or whatever ldd does.  The core files
are being generated fine.
