Ok.  Then maybe someone at redhat can help you convince me.
Why is the appropriate redhat person not sending this patch
upstream?

Agreed the code can be used.  I'm asking if this makes sense,
and if it is reliable, and if it typically meets the deadline.

I'm not arguing against your requirements.  I'm arguing that I don't
see how this allows you to meet your requirements when you can't
with the current kernel code.
If you are an existing user of a panic notifier I can see how
this removes the need to convert code, because the technique
does not change.  Unfortunately this is the only advantage I see
to this patch.

The kernel has called panic no new SCSI operations were execute.
I'm not saying don't notify your standby-node

In the example please answer:
- What causes the kernel to call panic?
- From the real failure to the kernel calling panic how long
  does it take?
- What actions does the notifier take to tell the other kernel
  it is dead.
- Why do we think the kernel taking that action will be reliable?
- From the point where we call panic() how long does it take until
  the kdump kernel is active?

Hmm.  So if I read this correctly all you need to execute is a single
outb instruction?
This is part one of my biggest confusions what do you need to
do to notify the other node that you have died?
