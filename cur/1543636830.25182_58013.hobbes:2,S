What's the source of the "never happen" comment in 
arch/i386/kernel/apic.c (repeated in the printk)? It plainly *does* 
happen (as Google and my own experience attest--look for 
call_spurious_interrupt, though), and there's nothing in Intel's 
documentation to suggest that it shouldn't, or that it's anything but 
a routine (though presumably rare) occurrence.
(Note also that the documentation reference is no longer correct. In 
the 2001 edition it was 7.6.13.5; in the latest edition the APIC gets 
its own chapter.)
>8.9. SPURIOUS INTERRUPT
>A special situation may occur when a processor raises its task 
>priority to be greater than or equal to the level of the interrupt 
>for which the processor INTR signal is currently being asserted. If 
>at the time the INTA cycle is issued, the interrupt that was to be 
>dispensed has become masked (programmed by software), the local APIC 
>will deliver a spurious-interrupt vector. Dispensing the 
>spurious-interrupt vector does not affect the ISR, so the handler 
>for this vector should return without an EOI.
