Right. Would be great to avoid it but if we have to use it then I think we 
should just store as much metainformation in the page as possible.

That would only work for slabs that use order 0 pages.

Note that the caches of the page allocator only work for zero order pages. 
And the reason for the existence of those caches is questionable. 
We have repeatedly found in pratical tests that switching off these 
caches has no influence on performance whatsoever.
