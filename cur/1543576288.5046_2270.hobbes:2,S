I'm glad to report that 2.4.0-test13-pre3 fixes the lockup (and
odd Oops messages) problems I had from test12 til test13-pre2. I've been
running it on both of my computers for a day and a half and everything is
OK.
At first, we thought it had something to do with the modules I was
using, but I was unable to confirm that, so I suspected it was something
to do with the kernel itself, I'm glad it was fixed.
