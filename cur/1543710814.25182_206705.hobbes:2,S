Start with the thing Robert already mentioned.  Ad ontop of that:
 - the horrible Winodes/Linux compat code.  We all know this kind
   of compat code is messy.  But the way it's don in this code is just
   incredibly idiotic.
 - totally braindead use of macro abstraction
 - those split into far too many files
 - wrong use of dma mapping abstraction
 - braindead malloc code
 - wrong modversions handling duplicated in every file
I'm really surprised you're admitting to having touched that code.
I'd have guessed everyone who did would hide in his house ashamed.

Replying to people personally is good taste.  You might know I'm on
lkml but on many other lists I'm not.  As are other people on lkml.
A filter can easily filter out duplicates but it can't magically
create copies of mails not addressed to you. 
In addition I tend to read my inbox fairly quick all the time and
the lkml mailbox only when I'm at least a little idle.
