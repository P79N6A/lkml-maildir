The original question was related to port existing C++ code to be used
as a kernel module.
Magically this always ends up in long discussions about how applicable
C++ is the the kernel as such which was not the original intent.
So following the original intent it does not matter what subset is
sanely used, only what adaptions is needed to kernel proper to support
modules written in C++.
But I have seen no patches this time either, so required modifications
are yet to be identified.
