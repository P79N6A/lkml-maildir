	Ok, a quick peruse of sys_readahead() seems to say that it
doesn't check for existing uptodate()ness.  That would be interesting.
I could have missed it, though.

	The problem we have with msync() and friends is not 'quick
population', it's "page is in the page cache already; another node
writes to the storage; must mark page as !uptodate so as to force a
re-read from disk".  I can't find where sys_readahead() checks for
uptodate, so perhaps calling sys_readahead() on a range always causes
I/O.  Correct me if I missed it.

	Lots of interesting stuff snipped.  This discussion has me
thinking, knowing now that there's possibility to move to a more optimal
interface.
