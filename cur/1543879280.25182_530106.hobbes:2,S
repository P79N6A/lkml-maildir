It's nice-dependent. At least, that's something one would expect from
this design..

Yep. Each nice level has a set of dynamic priorities which can be be
used by a task. After exhausting a time quota on a current level, the
task is moved to another (if there are no more -> "expired" array). So
the "PRI" field shows the current dynamic level.
The exceptions are SCHED_BATCH and Real-Time (FIFO and RR) tasks which
have different priority scheme.

As you can see there is only a single possible level for nice 19
tasks, that's why your first results looked strange _but_ it might
have been due to the old version which lacks the prio_matrix (or it
was broken.. PRI == 0 for NICE 19 is very strabge indeed). So it's
good you have upgraded to the recent one.
I have made a small debugging extension that allows to monitor all the
priority levels (and how many times) being used by a given task
(configured via proc).. will test it later (don't have sd-enabled
kernel here). Just want to be sure that the "rules" are never broken.
Most likely Con did it already but as he is off-line we can't know.

Yep, this one looks good.
