good question, i will have to understand more to answer it though.
our product has used this method for almost 2 years now.
> At a guess, you've enabled "low latency" setting on this port ?
yes.  here's a snippet from the script:
	echo -n "Starting ${racsvc}: "
	# set serial characteristics for RAC device
	setserial /dev/${ttyid} \
		port 0x${maddr} irq ${irqno} ^skip_test autoconfig
	setserial /dev/${ttyid} \
		uart 16550A low_latency baud_base 1382400	\
		close_delay 0 closing_wait infinite
	# now start pppd
	/sbin/modprobe -q ppp >/dev/null 2>&1
	/sbin/modprobe -q ppp_async >/dev/null 2>&1
	daemon pppd call ${service}
	RETVAL=$?
Thanks
