Hi,
I don't have a box with a PnP BIOS (well, I don't think I do...), so
could you send the relevant portions of the driverfs tree, showing the
new devices that you add for this bus?
Also a few minor comments on the patch:
	- pnpbios_bus_type should probably be made static, along with
	  alloc_pnpbios_root().
	- You don't check for out of memory in alloc_pnpbios_root() when
	  you call kmalloc().
	- why are you modifying the set_limit() parameters at the top of
	  your patch?  That doesn't seem relevant to the driverfs
	  changes.
	- in pnpbios_bus_match(), don't you have to check the value of
	  the call to match_device() to make sure you have a match?
	  That would keep pnpbios_device_probe() from being called for
	  every device like it looks your patch causes.
	- the pnpbios_device_probe() call should return a negative error
	  number if the device does not match, or some error happens.
	  Returning 1 does not mean success.  You also need to save off
	  the device specific info somehow in your structure, so that
	  the pnpbios_device_remove() can remove it.  Or am I just
	  missing something here?
And is there some way you can inline the patch?  It wasn't that big...
thanks,
greg k-h
