Yes, I think this is better. On a side node, why did we add psw_set_key
to ptrace.h? processor.h would have made more sense, no? It sets the key
in the psw, it is not usable in userspace and ptrace doesn't provide an
interface for reading/writing to the psw key. So a patch that moves the
inline to processor.h alongside __load_psw and __load_psw_mask would be
my solution.
