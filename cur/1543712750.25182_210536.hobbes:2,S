In ATA case detection of protocol violation is not possible w/o checking every
possible command opcode.  Even if implemented (notice that checking commands
coming from kernel is out of question - for performance reasons) this breaks
for future and vendor specific commands.

Unless code that crashes is the one doing validation. ;-)
