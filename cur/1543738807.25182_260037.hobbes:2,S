I'll respectfully disagree with James...  I think the most prudent
course of action is to follow the example of SCSI common code.
If the SCSI core is doing something wrong, we should fix that _first_,
not set a precedent of confusing dissociation.
Everyone knows that Linux programmers engineer with their cut-n-paste
