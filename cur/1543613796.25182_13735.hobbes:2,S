If I understand what you're saying, sleep(1) in child1, and
sleep(2) in the parent should fix the problem, which it doesn't.
And it still doesn't explain why it only happens with 2 childs.
Maybe I should have mentioned this before: the wait will clean up
the first child at the time the second child dies, or atleast
that's what wait() returns.

I know that too, as I said, only when child 1 dies before the
parent calls wait().
