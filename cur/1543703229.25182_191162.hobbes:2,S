Keep in mind that an interface may be ready to communicate and still not able to 
handle the ^C break.  The reason is that the ^C requires interrupt support which 
is not available until rather late in the bring up.  In particular, trying to 
register an interrupt routine prior to the memory subsystem being able to do an 
alloc causes failure to register the interrupt function, which does cause and 
error return from request_irq().  The version in the common.patch seems to keep 
this information but does nothing with it.  I think it would be better to try 
again later and to keep trying until the request is successful.  See for 
example, the kgdb patch in Andrew's mm breakout.
