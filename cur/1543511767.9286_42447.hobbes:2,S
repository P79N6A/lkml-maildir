Subject: Network iface is down but pingable

With Linux 2.2.12 and "ip utility, iproute2-ss990630" I see the following
buggy(?) behaviour:
After I "ifconfig down" or "ip link set iface down" a network interface, the
ip number of that interface is still pingable. If first encountered this with
an ethernet interface but can reproduce it now only with a ISDN PPP interface.
After "ifconfig <iface> down" or "ip link set <iface> down" an "ifconfig"
doesn't see the interface any more and "ip link show" correctly doesn't give
the "UP" flag. But with "ip route list table local" I can still see the route
for the IP number of the downed interface going to said interface. And ping
or other network access works.
I think this is a bug, if the interface is gone, the route should go too. If
this is not a bug maybe somebody can enlighten me on the proper procedure
for taking an interface down.
