looks good to me! I think this API is pretty straightforward. I've put 
this into my tree and have updated the sched-devel git tree:
 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched-devel.git
but there seems to be a bug in it, i get this:
 kobject_add failed for 500 with -EEXIST, don't try to register things with the same name in the same directory.
