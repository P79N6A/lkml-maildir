They should be independent in general, but they aren't when the particular
case of TCP/IPv4 is concerned.

Wrong...

You get zerocopy, yes. :-) No HW cksum, no zerocopy.
Don't let this stop you, however. It's always possible that other networking
stacks will eventually make use of SG while not requiring HW TCP/UDP cksums.
None of them do right now, but...

Not really, that way lies driver madness. The less complexity in the driver,
the better.
