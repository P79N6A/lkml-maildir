Offending patch is
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.21-rc4/2.6.21-rc4-mm1/broken-out/nommu-hide-vm_mm-in-nommu-mode.patch,
which seems rather dumb.  Or at least, its changelog does a good job of
making it look dumb.
David, what on earth does "this isn't used there" mean?  Surely it is
logical to have the mm backpointer in the vma in nommu mode?  What's going
on here?
