Yes, I am.  I'm not talking about avoiding only major changes.  I'm
talking about consistency in the way exposed, published kernel
interfaces are treated-- big and small.  As you state above, you did
the right thing, and I'm glad.  But the joy is derived from "not being
shot in the foot" more than it is "a desire to congratulate the group
for doing the only reasonable thing".

"Do or do not.  There is no try."
Sorry, couldn't resist ;-)
More details about my example...
Cdparanoia uses the HDIO_GET_IDENTITY ioctl.  It is not the only
package that uses it.  Cdrecord, cdda2wav and pcmcia services (!) all
got nailed by this change.  From 2.0.33 to 2.0.34 (sorry, I
misreported this earlier as 2.0.34->35.  2.0.33->34 is correct), the
size of the argument struct passed to the ioctl grew...  And the extra
bytes were padding!  They held nothing.  They added no functionality.
How were these pagakes 'incorrectly coded' such that they could have
expected this change?

I'm not talking about security holes.  I'm talking about 5.3.n's
strcpy() copying <n> bytes too far in the pentium optimized assembly and
segfaulting.  I'm talking about memcmp making alignment errors, etc.
These are not minor security holes; these are 'all programs relying on
ANSI string handling go *boom* randomly'.
And, once the bugs were found, they were fixed.  That also isn't my
problem.  My problem is that in the meantime, in a subminor release,
libc was made incompatable with all previous version in a fundamental
way.  *No* program dynamically linked against a previous version would
function any longer because the lookup tables in the compile-time
headers changed.  This is not a minor bug!  Nor has this kind of bug
been a rarity.
*That* is my problem.
