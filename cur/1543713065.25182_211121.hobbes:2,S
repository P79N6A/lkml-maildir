See dummy_capable for the root logic, i.e.:
       if (cap_is_fs_cap (cap) ? task->fsuid == 0 : task->euid == 0)
               return 0;
Note that you shouldn't assume that task == current.  The intent is to
support capability checks against other processes as well, e.g. the old
OOM killer code performed such checks as part of deciding which process
to kill.
Why fall through as opposed to just returning -EPERM?
What prevents any uid 0 process from changing these sysctl settings
(aside from SELinux, if you happen to use it and configure the policy
accordingly)?
