The GA-7VRXP is a known bad motherboard.  It has a bad electrical
interface to the AGP slot, so if you're using an AGP graphics card
without falling back to PCI access, you are pretty much guaranteed
system hangs or crashes after some time, depending on load.
This is an issue I confirmed with AMD several (six?) months ago.  I
don't know of any workarounds that maintain decent graphics performance,
and last I checked, Gigabyte had not acknowledged the problem.
Either drop your video card back to not using AGP, or buy a replacement
motherboard.
