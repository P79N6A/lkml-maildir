 terse answer: probably the same reason as for most stuff in
/proc/cpuinfo :-)
 Seriously, is there any kind of documentation on for the stuff you
mention? I am willing to learn. Isn't the cpuid just a kind of
serialnumber? The one that caused the big flame wars when Intel
introduced the concept? In any case, on my system(s) there seems to be
no device behind those files. On some systems, there is even no
"/dev/cpu" directory.
 I agree in a way that the changes to processor.h are not neccessary -
unless other parts of the kernel are interested in those values. I
probably should change that to make the thing easier to digest.
