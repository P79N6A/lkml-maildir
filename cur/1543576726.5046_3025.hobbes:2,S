I just tried dosemu again after upgrading to 2.4.0pre11, and it ran my program
about halfway and then started spinning with strace reporting:
vm86(0x1, 0x811f540, 0xa6, 0xfff8fff1, 0x81d30a4) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
vm86(0x1, 0x811f540, 0xa6, 0xfff8fff1, 0x81d30a4) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
vm86(0x1, 0x811f540, 0xa6, 0xfff8fff1, 0x81d30a4) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
I don't see any reason in the source why vm86 would report ENOSYS except if
the system call simply wasn't present. I'm not really familiar with this
source though so I could be missing something. Is there something wrong with
the vm86 code and it's just always returning ENOSYS now?
I haven't tried this program in 2.2 yet, I'll have to do that next time I get
a chance to reboot.
