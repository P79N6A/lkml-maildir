Well, global entries are for things common to all processes, like
vmalloced area. But you are just booting different kernel, which has
different vmalloced areas.

I'm not sure this is safe.

Okay, I wanted to make sure noone uses old swapon method.

Yep. That's what I'm going to do.

Do you stop all user processes before doing resume, for example?

But that might be problem at resume. Imagine uhci has buffers at
0x12345678, but in image being resumed, /bin/bash is at
0x12345678. Then you have a problem.

You don't easily know which one is it.
