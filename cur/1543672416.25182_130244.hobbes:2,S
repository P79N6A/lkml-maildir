Hello.  I realize that there won't be enough memory for double/triple
buffering using my patch. I even thought of doing the *2 thing, but
decided against it. The idea I had is that more and more video cards are
coming out with 128+ MB Ram, and that machines with >=1GB Ram are also
becoming common, especially for gamers etc...  Those users, I believe,
are less likely to use vesafb for anything other than graphics boot
splash and this just removes one little out-of-the-box problem many have
been having. I thought it to be a safer default than attempting to
ioremap the entire framebuffer. Just my thoughts,
