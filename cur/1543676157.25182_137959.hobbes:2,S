Raid-1 seems to work in 2.5.70-mm4, but raid-0 still fail.
Trying to boot with raid-0 autodetect yields a long string of:
Slab error in cache_free_debugcheck
cache 'size-32' double free or
memory after object overwritten.
(Is this something "Page alloc debugging"may be used for?)
kfree+0xfc/0x330
raid0_run
raid0_run
printk
blk_queue_make_request
do_md_run
md_ioctl
dput
blkdev_ioctl
sys_ioctl
syscall_call
I get a ton of these, in between normal
initialization messages.  Then the thing
dies with a panic due to exception in interrupt.
This is a monolithic smp preempt kernel on a dual celeron.
The disks are scsi, the filesystems ext2.  There is one
raid-0 array and two raid-1 arrays, as well as some
ordinary partitions.  Root is on raid-1.
