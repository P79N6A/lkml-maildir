I suggest asking on the kernelnewbies mailing list (see kernelnewbies.org).
Also, some people started on this web page, but it's only a beginning:

What kernel version?  That would have some effects on the answer.
Serial console is the usual option/route.  If it boots completely,
you could also try netconsole (or, dare I say it, usb console).
Or LKCD (lkcd.sf.net), or kmsgdump (2.5.75/2.6.0 at
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/kmsgdump/2.5.75/
).
