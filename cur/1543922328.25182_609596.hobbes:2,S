What I'm giving you is "Linus has decreed there can be LSMs other than 
SELinux."
Getting LSMs included should no longer be harder than for other 
parts of the kernel.
And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying my point should decide this 
discussion. It's simply the point that making it harder for external 
code also has advantages.
