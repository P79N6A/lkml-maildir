Ah, it's not a bug. :)

Seems whenever we create a background job, we'll have a pin to the directory where
the job is created. So though rmdir() removed the directory, the dentry's refcnt
is still >0, so cgroup_diput() in which number_of_cgroups is decreased is not called.
This explains why 'num_cgroups' showed in /proc/cgroups is not 1, and why umount failed.
You can try:
# mount -t ext3 /dev/sda6 /mnt
# cd /mnt
# sleep 10000 &
# cd ..
# umount /mnt
umount: /mnt: device is busy
And umount is OK for the below example:
# mount -t ext3 /dev/sda6 /mnt
# sleep 10000 &
# umount /mnt
