That's the 2.2 limit, it's gone.
The new limit is total memory and pid space. The pid's are intentionally
limited to 15 bits, the remaining bits are reserved.
In the worst case one running process can block 3 pid values (one for
the session, one for the process group, one for process id), thus
~11.000 running processes can exhaust the pid space.
