2 sockets x quad core will fail (fam 10h)
2 sockets x dual core works....( rev E, and rev F opteron)
there are some changs between opteron and fam10h.  fam10h may have
more local vectors for MCE...
or more banks and blocks...
will look at AMD64 Bios and kernel porting guide for Fam 10h again..
wonder if your code uncover some bugs ...
