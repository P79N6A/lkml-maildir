Over my dead body.
It's been done before. Many times. It's horrible, and means that you need 
to flush the TLB on context switches between threads and cannot share the 
same hw page tables across CPU's (since now different CPU's run different 
threads).
It generally makes threads pointless. You might as well implement them as 
processes with shared mmap.
