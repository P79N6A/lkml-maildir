thanks for clarifying this.
I tested the effect of this patch on 2.6.22-rc2 + CFS-v13
with the current CVS version of PostgreSQL 8.3devel.
pgbench with 25 clients and some large number of
transactions to make the result stable showed substantial
increase in throughput. Without NCQ, I got around 446 tps,
with NCQ I got around 680 via local TCP connection.
Previously, I got this level of performance only over
local unix socket and smaller number of simultaneous clients.
The disk is Seagate 320GB (ST3320620AS).
Again, thanks for this patch.
Best regards,
Zoltán Böszörményi
