   Some people on #lartc were wondering about the use of a route cache if there
   is only one route. It was reported that a single default route on a system
   that talks to many destinations would lead to a huge route cache, which is
   probably not more efficient than looking up the simple route.
   Would this 'small efficient flow cache' also solve this problem?
I contend there is no "problem".  Routing cache entries are
garbage collected, and even this can be tuned via sysctl.
