Indeed.  I fixed that and one other small issue Greg pointed out
a while ago.  I'll resend updated efivars driver patches in a separate
mail shortly.

This part isn't clear to me.  It looks like you are including a 
duplicate efi_get_variable function in efi.c in order to have 
access to EFI variable services (and perform the checks) very early 
before console initialization and/or efivars is available ... is 
that correct?
