Hi,
Some things I noticed:
1- Seems like you missed out framebuffer patch ( there was a little s/</<= 
patch ) so we don't see any penguin at startup anymore.
2- Con's patch makes KDE's sound daemon skip ( aRts ) when using Juk ( KDE 
JukeBox ) [ to skip just minimize/maximize any window fast ] . Seems like 
problem is at aRts decoding as mplayer -ao arts works fine without skips.
Regards,
