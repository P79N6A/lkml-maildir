why not do the union thing so that struct page grows automatically as 
new fields are added? It is quite bad design to introduce a hard limit 
like that. The only sizing concern is to make sure that the common 
.configs dont increase the size of struct page, but otherwise why not 
allow a larger struct page - it's for debugging only.
