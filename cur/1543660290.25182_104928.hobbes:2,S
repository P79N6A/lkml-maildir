	I thought about that a bit.  Since there is no /dev/watchdog and
no userspace communication channel, it seemed bad to put it there.
Heck, with no device, it doesn't necessarily fit in drivers/char in the
first place.
	If a few folks think drivers/char/watchdog is better, I've no
problem with it.  If anyone has a better idea...
