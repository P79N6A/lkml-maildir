ok, found a bug that could explain the situation: mutex sleeps+wakeups 
were incorrectly credited as 'interactive sleep' periods, causing the dd 
processes to be boosted incorrectly. The dd processes created a workload 
in which they blocked each other in such a pattern that they got boosted 
periodically, starving pretty much every other task.
the fix is significant and affects alot of workloads, and should further 
improve interactivity in noticeable ways. I'm not 100% sure it solves 
all the starvation problems (e.g. how could normal-prio dd tasks starve 
the SCHED_FIFO irq threads that drove SysRq?), but the results so far 
look promising.
i've uploaded the -50-45 patch, can you under this kernel trigger a 
'meltdown' on your SMT box?
