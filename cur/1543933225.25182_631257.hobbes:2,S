There is a point, but it's a weak one: you want it to unfold in the same menu 
as you select the option.  So, if you unfold the sub-options in a separate 
sub-menu, you better use [ ] (or just blank), as this will allow you to 
enter the sub-menu, and see the unfold take place inside the same menu.
IMHO, I prefer < >, but newbies probably prefer [ ], as it is less abstract.
Provided there is agreement, and we go with < >, it would mean a slight 
change to Host side USB, like this (note new USB Core Config sub-menu):
      --- Support for Host-side USB                                      
      [ ]   USB Core Config  --->                                       
      [ ]   USB Host Controller Drivers  --->                        
      ---   NOTE: USB_STORAGE needs SCSI, and 'SCSI disk support' may
      ---   also be needed; see USB_STORAGE Help for more information
      < >   USB Mass Storage support  --->                          
      [ ]   The shared table of common (or usual) storage devices    
      [ ]   USB Monitor

      < >   USB DSL modem support  --->

      [ ]   USB Miscellaneous drivers  --->                                         
Thanks!
