Subject: [PATCH] prevent oops in xprt_lock_write, against 2.5.32

hi linus-
when several RPC requests want to reconnect a TCP transport socket at
once, xprt_lock_write serializes the tasks to prevent multiple socket
connects.  however, TCP connects are always done by a RPC child task that
has no request slot.  xprt_lock_write can oops if there is no request slot
allocated to the invoking RPC task.  reviewed and accepted by Trond.
the xprt_lock_write changes are not yet in 2.4, so this patch does not 
apply to 2.4.
