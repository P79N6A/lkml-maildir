Thank you Evgeniy for this work.  A very minor change request - please
follow the kernel CodingStyle:
	if (!request_region(0xa0, 0x20, "pic2"))
		{
		release_region(0x20, 0x20);
		return;
		}
should be:
	if (!request_region(0xa0, 0x20, "pic2")) {
		release_region(0x20, 0x20);
		return;
	}
Cheers, Andreas
