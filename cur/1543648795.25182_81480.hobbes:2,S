Linus,
Apart from the multiple vs. single system call issue, are you okay with
the creation of an fd,file * etc. without having a device ?
The former issue could certainly be avoided by having multiple syscalls.
In fact, Davide had originally suggested an interface looking somewhat like
this:
	int sys_epoll_create(int maxfds);
	int sys_epoll_addfd(int epd, int fd);
	void sys_epoll_close(int epd);
	int sys_epoll_wait(int epd, struct pollfd **pevts, int timeout);
which is roughly what Hanna tried to multiplex onto the single sys_epoll.
