Tested-by would be good too.  Because over time, we will generate a list of
people who own the relevant hardware and who are prepared to test changes. 
So if you make changes to random-driver.c you can do `git-log
random-driver.c|grep Tested-by" to find people who can test your changes
for you.
Not that many people are likely to bother.  The consequences of being
slack are negligible, hence there is little incentive to do the extra
work.
