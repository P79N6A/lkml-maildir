I'd say the ext2 code still needs some cleanup. You are using reserved
fields. If you need the space, PLEASE CHANGE THE NAME. (I think you are
the second person to do this) If I look at the code and see "reserved",
I'm going to think it means exactly that. This is not safe.
I see that you are using the .osd2.linux2.l_i_reserved2 member of the
ext2 inode. Consider the layout already in use by the HURD. It matches
up perfectly with the existing Linux inode, but does not match up with
your new inode. It also already supports 32-bit UIDs.
Here it is:
                struct {
                        __u8    h_i_frag;       /* Fragment number */
                        __u8    h_i_fsize;      /* Fragment size */
                        __u16   h_i_mode_high;
                        __u16   h_i_uid_high;
                        __u16   h_i_gid_high;
                        __u32   h_i_author;
                } hurd2;
It would be very good to match up with h_i_uid_high and h_i_gid_high.
Inode space is not to be wasted.
You could clean up the inode quite a bit:
struct ext2_inode {
        __u16   i_mode;         /* File mode */
        __u16   i_uid;          /* Low 16 bits of UID */
        __u32   i_size;         /* Size in bytes */
        __u32   i_atime;        /* Access time */
        __u32   i_ctime;        /* Creation time */
        __u32   i_mtime;        /* Modification time */
        __u32   i_dtime;        /* Deletion Time */
        __u16   i_gid;          /* Low 16 bits of GID */
        __u16   i_links_count;  /* Links count */
        __u32   i_blocks;       /* Blocks count */
        __u32   i_flags;        /* File flags */
        __u32   i_translator;   /* HURD only */
        __u32   i_block[EXT2_N_BLOCKS];/* Pointers to blocks */
        __u32   i_version;      /* File version (for NFS) */
        __u32   i_file_acl;     /* File ACL */
        union {
        __u32   i_size_high;    /* High 32 bits of file size */
        __u32   i_dir_acl;      /* Directory ACL */
        }u;
        __u32   i_reserved1;
        __u16   i_reserved2;
        __u16   i_mode_high;    /* HURD only */
        __u16   i_uid_high;     /* High 16 bits of UID */
        __u16   i_gid_high;     /* High 16 bits of GID */
        __u32   i_author;       /* HURD only */
};
