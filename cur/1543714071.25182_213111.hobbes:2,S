Good catch!
No, I don't think you're missing the point. There are lots of drivers,
and unlike core kernel code, drivers have corner cases which are never
tested. Work on drivers is always welcome.
Feel free to make patch and submit it to Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com>.
For 2.2 and 2.4, I think you can CC kernel maintainers too.
