Sigh. The patch was way too incomplete - I somehow missed
PCI_PREF_LIMIT_UPPER32... Corrected patch appended - I think it's
worth applying in either case since a bridge window at address 0 is
an obvious bug and this patch fixes it.

I don't think that transparency is the case here - I read specs for some
recent Intel chipsets and it looks like they are pretty accurate now with
a "subtractive decode" flag - over the last couple of years, at least.
There are, of course, some strange "priority decode rules", but they
can be safely ignored as far as the kernel resource management is
concerned.

I've just checked the setup-bus code and have to say that its ability to
correctly handle the 64-bit BARs is close to zero...
On the positive side, getting it right doesn't seem to be as complicated
as I thought initially - mainly because only the prefetchable memory
window of p2p bridge is 64-bit. This effectively limits >4G allocations
to prefetchable resources only.
Anyway, using PCI bus space above 4G on x86 seems to be a must these
days, and I have some spare hardware to play with. Maybe I'll be able
to get something working by mid January or so...
Ivan.

PCI: do respect full 64-bit address for bridge prefetch window
Prevent the prefetch window from being programmed with a bogus address
when its respective resource gets allocated above the 4G mark.
Note that we cannot yet guarantee correct resource allocations
above 4G, though it might work in some simple cases.
