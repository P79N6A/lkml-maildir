True.

Well, Dan already said that he doesn't see it with O_APPEND (aka ">>"), 
but yes, other filesystems may not be that lucky.
I'd actually not be surprised if the O_APPEND thing is tested by some of 
the FS stress tools, so I suspect all the regular filesystems get it 
right. Of course, since most of them - at least the local ones - use the 
same generic framework, that's an even safer bet.
NFS etc is very special, of course, especially in the presense of clients 
on different machines. At that point, I wouldn't guarantee a whole lot.
