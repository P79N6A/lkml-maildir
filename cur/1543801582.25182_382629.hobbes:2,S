So you don't need a two minute delay for those because as you said it

And in those cases the 2 minute freeze is meaningless

Any change will capture different oopses. A boot option isnt a bad idea,
or for that matter also truncating the call trace to the *top* few (or
as Bryce suggested on irc reversing the printing order)

If the input layer is running that would be sensible.

Well you could try and do that but I was more thinking that if the
console has been told we are in graphics mode then the 2 minute delay
shouldn't occur.
