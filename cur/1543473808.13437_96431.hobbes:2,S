It took me a while to spot this message, and ignore the "clear_choices"
error reported by wish.  At the end is a small patch so that xconfig
exits with a non-zero exit status, so that make aborts correctly.
I haven't been able to work out why the "Ooops" is generated in the
first place, but I have been able to track down that it is due to the
following in arch/i386/config.in (processor derived options).
    if [ "$CONFIG_M386" != "n" ]; then
After that point, my lack of knowledge of xconfig's internals kicks in!
