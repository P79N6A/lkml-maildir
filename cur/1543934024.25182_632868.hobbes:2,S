when i had that module modular and added to the initrd, udev didn`t work, though.
same error message:
udevd[1226]: init_udev_socket: error getting socket: Address family not supported by protocol 
not sure if i did a mistake here....
anyway, this message is not obvious to the end user.
i like the kernel being modular, but i also like it if things "just work" - and with "allmodconfig", modular UNIX domain sockets seem to create hassle.
(see 
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-476363-highlight-.html
 or 
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-463793-highlight-.html
 )
so, if this patch is being rejected, maybe it would be useful if udev would give a proper hint, if it`s missing this kernel feature. 
btw, udev documentation telling this:
  - The kernel must have sysfs, unix domain sockets and networking enabled.
    (unix domain sockets (CONFIG_UNIX) as a loadable kernel module may work,
    but it is completely silly - don't complain if anything goes wrong.)
furthermore, if this needs to be modular, then i`d please have tcp/ip networking modular, too. :)

ps:
not being a skilled programmer, so this is mostly an admins/users perspective.
