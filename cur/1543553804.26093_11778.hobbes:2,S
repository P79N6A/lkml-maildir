It looks very like to me like a poster child for the non timestamp
RTT update problem I just described on netdev. Linux always retransmits
too early and there is never a better RTT estimate which could fix it.
2.4's advertised windows also do not seem to cope with weird window
advertising strategy of windows (start with a small window and then
suddenly increase it). Linux's stays small.
