Hi,
Please Cc: me when replying, since I'm not subscribed.
I dare to ask this here because I have a problem that seems to be
either kernel or hardware related.  Unfortunately I can't see any
error message to direct me for further investigation.
I'm using 2.6.18-4-686 (Debian's kernel), but I've tried with 2.6.16.49
and 2.6.20.7 without success.
The problem is a big lag (more that 10 or 20 seconds) for some system
calls, for numerous unrelated applications (top, vim, apt-cache).
What is even more puzzling is that once the application has successfully
started, I can run it again without any lag.
I've used strace to catch a few lags.  "strace -fttT" has been used.
