| Which is why that particular patch is wrong:  "ubuf" is a dma address,

But the existing code most certainly does use it with memcpy. I'm
looking at test11-mm1 source, but the last memcpy line he noted is most
definitely in the existing source.
Or did I misunderstand what you meant by "not expected to work for
memcpy()?" It may be that the code around the memcpy is wrong and should
be using ubuf, and that no diddling with fix it, but someone clearly DID
expect it to work ;-)
