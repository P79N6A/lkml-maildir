Hello!
   I've found strange things with 2.3.7 compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3
   It's IP system/UP kernel
Linux angband 2.3.7 #16 Mon Jun 21 19:53:45 MSD 1999 i586 unknown
Just after boot:
angband:~$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         30664      29596       1068      22896      80020      20316
-/+ buffers/cache:    4123564     101404
Swap:       102780        124     102656
Strangely enough I have 32M RAM there and 80M of them in buffers???
And I can Lockup this box completely with this little program:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        int i,t=0;
        char *tt;
        while(1) {
                tt=malloc(1024*1024);
                for (i=0;i<1024*1024;i++) {
                        tt[i]=1;
                }
                t++;
                printf("Allocated %d M\n",t);
        }
}
It's output:
angband:~/danger$ ./a.out
Allocated 1 M
Allocated 2 M
Allocated 3 M
Allocated 4 M
Allocated 5 M
Allocated 6 M
Allocated 7 M
Allocated 8 M
Allocated 9 M
Allocated 10 M
Allocated 11 M
Allocated 12 M
Allocated 13 M
Allocated 14 M
Allocated 15 M
Allocated 16 M
Allocated 17 M
And now box answers only to Alt-SysRq etc.
First time I tried this after few console switces I got complete lockup:
No switches, no cursor, no Alt-sysRq, blank screen.
No oopses were found.
But FS is corrupted, e.g. If I write some file, and then
run this proggie, I have the file in place, but contend is random data.
(Well not very random, once I got old dependency file from kernel)
Actual data sometimes found by fsck and attached to /lost+found,
and sometimes - not found.
