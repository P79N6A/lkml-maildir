Don't put it in /etc, because then
	"find /etc -type f -follow | xargs grep foo"
will grep a bunch of binary files.  One of the real joys of using Linux
compared to most other Unix or Unix-like systems is how most Linux systems
keep binaries out of /etc, so when I find myself trying to find some
random configuration thing, I can grep without fear.
