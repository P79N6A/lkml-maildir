Good ;)
I should of added this is from 2.5; so it has been around for awhile.  I
also took a look at your patch -- looks good, you should submit it to
Marcelo... it cannot hurt for 2.4.
One thing:
    -	int processor;
    +#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
    +	int processor; /* keep old name to avoid upsetting all archs */
    +#endif
It is normally bad form to have conditionally entries in the
task_struct... otherwise, looks good.
