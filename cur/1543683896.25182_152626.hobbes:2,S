could you pse keep that 'discussion' to where it belongs?!
it is definitely 'off topic' in the "linux-assembly" mailing list.
and, it is ridiculous, since it already generated much (M U C H) more traffic 
than the messages you're just complaining about. - so you should eliminate 
yourself, consequently, from that 'clean' list of yours -???- 
you complaint it is un-just - or did you, for instance, eliminate the owner of 
<rms@gnu.org> from your lk-devel list, too? who already emanated so many 
messages which have nothing to do with linux kernel devel that Rick would 
never be able to make up for that much of nonsense.
best,
