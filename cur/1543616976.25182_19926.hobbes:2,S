(let's hope this time the mail client understands I want to send this in 
plain text!)
I thought that, by changing the socket architecture, the result would be 
independent to the actual implementation of the socket. For example, a 
"PPP over generic socket" could be adapted to "PPP over AF_IRDA socket" 
without having to tear one's hair out implementing the pretty complex 
/dev/irnet virtual TTY. That is a good solution anyway, but it is very 
difficult to port it to different kinds of socket.
What do you exactly mean with "kernel space wrapper"? I guess "user space 
wrapper" is something like VTun (which I tried, and it works like a dream. 
Only, isn't it a bit inefficient to go through user space?)

                 And at the total opposite of the spectrum you have IrNET, 
as
it is implemented in kernekl 2.4.X, that pass PPP packets on an IrDA
socket in the kernel without going through the socket API. But that's
the solution only if you don't mind debugging kernel code...
                 BTW, I don't understand why the socket architecture would 
need
to be modified. You just need a user space or a kernel space wrapper.
