Ah, I see. Thanks for that introduction :-)

Ok,.. that sounds reasonable,.. so the whole thing might (!) actually be
a hardware design error,... but we just don't use that hardware any
longer when accessing devices via sata_nv.
So this doesn't solve our problem with PATA drives or other devices
(although we had until now no reports of errors with other devices) and
we have to stick with iommu=soft.
If one use iommu=soft the sata_nv will continue to use the new code for
the ADMA, right?
Best wishes,
Chris.
