Hello,
When I enable the ps/2 mouse, I get some kind of conflict between it and
the keyboard (usually only after using them both for a while) resulting
in both going ... "dead". The serial mouse still works though. Disabling
the ps/2 mouse and unloading the module does sort it out again. (This I
do over the network ;)
Any ideas how I can debug this problem?
Thanks,
Hugo van der Merwe
