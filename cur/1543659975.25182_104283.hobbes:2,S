So, in a program which uses pthread_create(), a SIGCHLD handler must
either (a) be reentrant, or (b) be unblocked (or installed) in one
thread only.

Indeed, as Ingo pointed out, some signals are like poor man's threads,
and that programming model makes that explicit.  I like that, because
it means the signal handler can validly do everything normal code can
do, including use mutexes and other locking primitives which may sleep.
(Some other signals are intrinsically thread-local though, such as
SIGSEGV and SIGFPE - they are synchronous exception handlers rather
than asynchronous event handlers).
Thanks for your quick answer,
