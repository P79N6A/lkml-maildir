The original firmware are stored in files named:
aic7xxx_reg.h_shipped  aic7xxx_seq.h_shipped
They are copied to aic7xxx_seq.h aic7xxx_reg.h during the build.
So no problem here.
Snip from original Makefile:
CLEAN_FILES :=
...
        drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_seq.h \
        drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_reg.h \
        drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm/aicasm_gram.c \
        drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm/aicasm_scan.c \
        drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm/y.tab.h \
        drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm/aicasm \
As you can see the files in question has always been deleted during
a make clean.
The only functional change done is the fact that firmware are now deleted
by make mrproper, as is true for rest of the kernel.
