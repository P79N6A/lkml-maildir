This has actually been on my TODO list for awhile, though not quite in
the way that you outlined in your initial post. A good reason for why
cpusets are fat at the moment is largely because there's no isolation or
configurability of individual features supported and exposed, leaving one
with an all-or-nothing scenario.
Both the SMP and NUMA bits are fairly orthogonal, and I think isolating
those and making each configurable would already help trim things down
quite a bit (ie, nodemask handling, scheduler domains, etc.). The
filesystem bits are not really that heavy comparatively, so rather than
working on a tiny cpuset implementation, simply splitting up the existing
implementation seems like a much saner approach, and one that can be done
incrementally.
While we're on the topic of cpuset reform, co-processors are another
thing that cpusets is in pretty good shape to handle (particularly in
terms of carving up large grid and dataflow processors and things of that
nature, which we do have customer use cases for in embedded space today).
I'll try to follow up to this thread with an initial patch series in the
not-too-distant future.
