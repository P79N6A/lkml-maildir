Is the set_pages_* API that replaces change_page_attr described somewhere? I have been unable to 
find it with Google.
I'm trying to modify the VirtualBox kernel module to work with 2.6.24-git (and 2.6.25) on x86_64 
architecture. The current code has a value of the third argument of the call (prot) with 3 variants. 
All variations have the following bits set: _PAGE_PRESENT, _PAGE_RW, _PAGE_DIRTY, and 
_PAGE_ACCESSED. Number 2 adds _PAGE_NX to the above, and number 3 adds _PAGE_GLOBAL to the bits in 
variation 1.
 From the code in arch/x86/mm/pageattr.c, I figured I need to call set_pages_wb() unconditionally, 
and set_pages_nx() if _PAGE_NX is set. Will these calls be sufficient? I thought about calling 
set_pages_rw(), but that entry is not exported.
Thanks,
Larry
