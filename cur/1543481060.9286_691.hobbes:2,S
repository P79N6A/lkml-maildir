	The difference being that not all gotos are equal. If you have
something like
if (improbable_condition)
	foo();
else
	bar();
baz();
yo can translate it different ways. The best one being:
<test the condition>
jump to l1 if true;
code for foo();
l2:
code for baz();
return;
l1:
code for bar();
jump to l2;
That way the expectation value of execution time becomes minimal. If the
code for foo() and baz() is cheap and codition is really improbable we get
a serious speedup. Compiler can't tell the relative probability of code
paths. The standard way to achieve this effect being:
	if (improbable_condition)
		goto off_the_main_path_we_go;
	foo();
cleanup:
	baz();
	return;
off_the_main_path_we_go:
	bar();
	goto cleanup;

	Which reminds me of average temperature of patients per floor in

	It's not a question of structured vs. spaghettish. It's a question
of implementing two constructs missing in C: asymmetric if and (gaack!)
very limited sort of exceptions. Compilers might get advanced and all
such, but in C we have no way to inform compiler on relative probability
of branches (and it can't figure it out for itself - AI-complete problem).
Notice that ten levels of nested ifs are not more readable than a jungle
of gotos. There is a logic behind the rejection of gotos. In many
situations it leads to winnitude. But if you'll look at this one you'll
get the opposite result.
