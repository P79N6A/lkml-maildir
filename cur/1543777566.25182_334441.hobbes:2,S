No, FTP PUT _cannot_ use it, exactly because sendfile() can't do anything 
but file sources (and not even all file sources - it can only do regular 
filesystems that use the page cache).
This is why I want to get rid of sendfile(). It's a fundamentally broken
interface. Really. In contrast, the pipe buffers _can_ be used for direct
socket->file interfaces.
Now, even pipe buffers obviously won't actually be really "zero-copy":
you'll end up needing one copy to align the result, since the incoming
network packets will obviously not be nice page-sized and page-aligned
things. But they won't need the "copy to user space" and "copy back from
user space into kernel space", so it will be a question of _minimal_ copy
(and avoiding unnecessary user space VM work).
