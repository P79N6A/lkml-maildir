Lately, using the nForce IDE driver I have noticed a few glitches with 
it that affect stability.
I use the BK tree for my kernel source. Lately, if I 1) clone a fresh 
tree (i pull from a few places so sometimes there are some boggling 
conflicts that a fresh tree fixes) or 2) run a bk pull, X will SEGV out 
of nowhere. At first I thought it was the amount of disk activity.
But after reading the saga of the flukey tty code in the kernel, I am 
thinking this could also be because of that? Lots of stuff scrolls by 
when doing a bk clone, and when resolve runs after a bk pull there is 
often lots of output.
There is no oops at all, nor anything that might be of help in dmesg.
Any ideas? I started noticing it around halfway through 2.5.56...
Regards
Josh
