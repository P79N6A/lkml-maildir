Good paper ..thanks for the pointer.
I briefly went thr' the paper and my impression is it expect each task
to specify the length of each new request it initiates. Is that correct?
If we have to apply EEVDF to SCHED_NORMAL task scheduling under CFS, how
would we calculate that "length of each new request" (which is reqd
before we calculate its virtual deadline)?

There is also p->wait_runtime which is taken into account when
calculating p->fair_key. So if p3 had waiting in runqueue for long
before, it can get to run quicker than 10ms later.
