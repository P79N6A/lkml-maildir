Hi Andrew,
I'm seeing a consistent hang on shutdown on x86_64.  It is a new
behavior since 2.6.1-rc1-mm2.
It hung in wait_for_completion() called from sched_migrate_task() called
from sched_balance_exec().  The migration threads are not in the kgdb
"info thread" list. It looks like they've already been killed.
I can do some more debugging, but I'm hoping someone will own up.
