The isdn_audio_tlookup function (in both the CVS version and the
old version included in the kernel) doesn't compile with recent egcs/pgcc
versions because of an illegal register spill:
        __asm__("cld\n"
                "1:\tlodsb\n\t"
                "xlatb\n\t"
                "stosb\n\t"
                "loop 1b\n\t"
      : :  "b"((long) table), "c"(n), "D"((long) buff), "S"((long) buff)
                               ^
      :        "bx", "cx", "di", "si", "ax");
                      ^^
Since there's a C version of the statement, as well (used on non-x86), I'd
recommend to change
#if ((CPU == 386) || (CPU == 486) || (CPU == 586))
in isdn_audio.c to
#if 0
until someone fixes the asm.
