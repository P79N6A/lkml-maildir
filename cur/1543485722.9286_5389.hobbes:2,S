Its a broken modem sharing package (all security off by default), though
I've seen it used as a firewall for some Japanese bank (they took it down
REAL fast).  
It's telnet redirector has the same problem  ... you simply connect and
type in the address of the host you want, no password required.  With
hundreds of these damn things in use, it's become a popular means of
causing trouble without being traced.  To top it off logging is only
available in the registered version. Since the user never sees a
problem until somone terminates their account for something they
didn't do to they just happily go on using it. Wingate software has
ignored any complaints that their software is a hazard to the internet and
have refused to fix it.
This gets worse; Compaq is now reported as bundling this software
package with some of some of their machines.
See 
http://www.wingate.com
 for more info.
And for the good of the net: boycott Compaq until they get a clue!!
