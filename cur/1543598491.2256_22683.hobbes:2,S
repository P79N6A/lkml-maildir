Subject: Could NFS daemons be started via inetd?

Hi,
I am setting up NFS on my Linux box.
When I start server daemons from init scripts or by hand,
everything is working fine.
I tried to arrange these daemons to be run by inetd
but after I issue an NFS mount command inetd starts spawning
tons on rpc.mountd daemons. Log is filled with:
rpc.mountd[179]: connect from 127.0.0.1
rpc.mountd[180]: connect from 127.0.0.1
...
and load average goes up (went up to 40)
I repeatedly killall'ed rpc.mountd and eventually inetd
noticed failing service and disabled it.
Does anybody tried this? If you do, I am very interested in your
inetd.conf and/or NFS part of startup script. Mine is:
inetd.conf
