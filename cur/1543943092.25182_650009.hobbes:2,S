Subject: [PATCH] m68k: correct setting of struct user.u_ar0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Commit 6e16d89bcd668a95eb22add24c02d80890232b66
    Sanitize the type of struct user.u_ar0
    struct user.u_ar0 is defined to contain a pointer offset on all
    architectures in which it is defined (all architectures which define an
    a.out format except SPARC.) However, it has a pointer type in the headers,
    which is pointless -- <asm/user.h> is not exported to userspace, and it
    just makes the code messy.
    Redefine the field as "unsigned long" (which is the same size as a pointer
    on all Linux architectures) and change the setting code to user offsetof()
    instead of hand-coded arithmetic.
forgot to change the m68k setting code, causing the following compiler warning:
    arch/m68k/kernel/process.c:338: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast
