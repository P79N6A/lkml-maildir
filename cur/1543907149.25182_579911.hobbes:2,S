No idea, just thought it would be worth a try. My console is garbled
too, doing that unicode stuff fixed it for me. (Though it appears to
work better nowaday: new text is fine and other than the first consoles
are fine too, which wasn't the case a while ago I think.)
I thought he was using a VGA console, wouldn't that be in text mode?
