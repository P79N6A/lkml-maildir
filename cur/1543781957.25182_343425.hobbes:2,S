I encountered a similar issue with some software that I wrote, and used 
a similar workaround, however this was basically because there wasn't 
enough time available at the time to redesign things to work properly. 
The problem here is essentially caused by the fact that the mutex is 
being locked for an excessively large proportion of the time and not 
letting other threads in. In the case I am thinking of, posting the 
messages to the thread that was hogging the mutex via a signaling queue 
would have been a better solution than using yield and having correct 
operation depend on undefined parts of thread scheduling behavior..
