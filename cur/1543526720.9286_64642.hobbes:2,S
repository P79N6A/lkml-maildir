No I don't. It makes perfect sense to have a program SUID/SGID so it can
manipulate certain files. That is a minor use of SUID today, it is used
mostly (via SUID root) to give a program capabilities; it will be the only
use in a capability system.

Yes. And there are not that many of them around. Here I have 2098
executables in /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin, of which 69
are SUID or SGID, a 3.2% of the total. Perhaps a server-style machine would
have a few more than that, and less general executables.

Again, the changes are in system-wide, security-critical services
_only_. But a lot of new tools will have to appear: Capable-aware find(1),
tar(1) (Or its equivalent), dump/restore(8), ls(1), chmod(1) (or
chcap(8))... And as long as the filesystem format (including ACLs too)
isn't defined, nobody will write/port them. And if they don't exist,
changes in the filesystem are useless...
