I'd argue against it.
CVS is a piece of crap, and anyody who maintaines stuff in CVS just makes 
it harder to ever merge back. That's not just a theory - we've had that 
situation happen in real life over the years, which is why I definitely 
don't want to see any external CVS trees given any kind of recognition at 
all.
