I have tried to change to kernel 2.4.16 from 2.4.13 and my system crashes 
every time it starts using swap. This is the case down to 2.4.14 even when 
it is built using default options. My system is a AMD duron with 128MB of 
RAM and two swap partitions both 128MB on my non boot hard drive.
could someone please fix this
thanks
