i've recently invent cute idea - put a configure file in linux/ tree, so 
users
can do things like that:
#cd /usr/src/linux
#./configure
#make -j5
#make install
#reboot
&have completely new well-cfgured kernel.
maybe this needs some nifty .pl or .c converter of /proc/config.gz
to new .config in linux/scripts/. I htink its highly need to be included, 
bcause it helps poor users migrate to 2.6 from earlier 2.5 or 2.4 or even 
2.2/2.0 ;).
Compare this with abs stupid /proc/updike ;)!
By the way, what happens with developers? why they hang at 2.6.0? we want 
-bk<N> patches !
Please cc/bc me, I am not in list.
