So, would you Ack something like the following then?
======================
Enabling NETIF_F_SG without NETIF_F_ALL_CSUM actually seems to work fine by
doing an old-fashioned data copy in tcp_sendpage.
And for devices that do not calculate IP checksum in hardware (e.g. InfiniBand)
calculating the checksum for all packets in network driver is worse than have
the CPU piggyback the checksum compitation with the copy process.
Finally, note that NETIF_F_SG is necessary to be able to allocate skbs >
PAGE_SIZE on busy systems.
So, let's allow that combination, again, for drivers that want it.
