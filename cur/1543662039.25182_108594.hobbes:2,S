Too radical? After the modules rewrite how could anything short of a
rewrite in another language be too radical. At least a unified set of
security hooks would be a feature which would be immediately useful and
easy to understand. The benefits of the module changes are not as obvious.
With MS pushing their own security initiative, which seems to be building
computers which only run their os, this would have been a really good
feature from a mindshare perspective.
