I always "knew" that the stability of the Internet is secured by the
exponential backoff in TCP. A small packet loss on uncongested links
is a part of this technique, and it existed long before ATM studies
produced RED (which infiltrated backwards). It also requires sending
stacks to "give up for a little bit" (actually to give up a lot, and
together with the slow start it produced the well known "saw" of the
window size).
So far I fail to see how a repainted NAK, kludged into a NAKless protocol,
would improve stability of the Internet. If anything, it is going to
exaggerate traffic oscillations. I would appreciate couple of links
to reputable studies or discussions on the subject.
