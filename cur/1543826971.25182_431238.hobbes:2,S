... this is a 64-bit BAR preset with a 16-bit mask, preset
to the valid 32-bit address 0x0000_0000_f7ef_0000.

... here the algorithm thinks the addrss is above 4 GB and disables it. 
  It should re-enable it when the device is turned back on, though; if 
it doesn't that's very strange.
Anyway, the error seems to be that the line:
+			} else if (l) {
... should be ...
+			} else if (lhi) {
... since l contains the lower half of the pre-set address at that 
point, and lhi is the upper half.
