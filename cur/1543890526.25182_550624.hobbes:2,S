One significant issue was screwed up sequencing causing
tools like 'xconfig' to display things wrong.  Appended
is a patch fixing just that goof.

They seemed fine to me, other than the write_reg() macro
having an embedded 'goto' ... explicitly against the
Documentation/CodingStyle guidelines.  ("Chapter 12",
point 1 = "macros that affect code flow".)
I like seeing more of the SPI drivers go upstream.  ;)

======	CUT HERE
Switch the order of LCD_CLASS_DEVICE and BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE,
so that it's possible to insert LCD devices without borking the
dependency displays of xconfig and other config tools.
