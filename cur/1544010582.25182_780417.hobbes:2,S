Subject: [RFC] remove linux/hardirq.h from asm-generic/local.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While looking at reducing the amount of architecture namespace pollution
in the generic kernel, I found that asm/irq.h is included in the vast
majority of compilations on ARM (around 650 files.)
Since asm/irq.h includes a sub-architecture include file on ARM, this
causes a negative impact on the ccache's ability to re-use the build
results from other sub-architectures, so we have a desire to reduce
the dependencies on asm/irq.h.
It turns out that a major cause of this is the needless include of
linux/hardirq.h into asm-generic/local.h.  The patch below removes this
include, resulting in some 250 to 300 files (around half) of the kernel
then omitting asm/irq.h.
My test builds still succeed, provided two ARM files are fixed
(arch/arm/kernel/traps.c and arch/arm/mm/fault.c) - so there may be
negative impacts for this on other architectures.
Note that x86 does not include asm/irq.h nor linux/hardirq.h in its
asm/local.h, so this patch can be viewed as bringing the generic version
into line with the x86 version.
