Thanks for working on this. Some cleanup in this area was long overdue.

I am not sure why you have different hooks for timeofday and monotic.
It may be better to read the timeonly once and then convert to monotonic
or TOD.

Hmm, I am missing something here, but how do you handle
the case where the timer interrupt uses HPET, but the offset
from last timer interrupt is determined using TSC.  But
some machines don't have a reliable TSC, so it may need
to use a different "offset" source.
I guess you would need two different drivers here?

That won't work because the kernel needs to write to 
these variables (e.g. to update the wall time from the interrupt
handler). So in general you need two different mappings, one
read only for user space and another writable one for the kernel.
Regarding your patch, putting the delta in a virtual call
seems a bit of overkill. Is that really needed? That was
just from a quick grep, i haven't read it in detail.
