You mean like the way the Alpha has a PTE bit that says 'this page is
valid at the same address in every process', and the address space
number (ASN) that can be used to 'uniquefy' cache entries for the
same virtual addresses in different processes?
Well, we ain't got these luxuries/complications in VAXland...  Hell, 
we don't even have two-level page tables :-(
