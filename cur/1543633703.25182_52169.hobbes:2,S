Maybe a bit off topic, but we (at my work) are using plenty of eepro100
cards with both drivers ( e100 and eepro100 )(shipped with dell
machines, and others).
We have lot of problem with these card: from link autonegociation to the
really frequent cmd_timeout.
We expreienced some freezes, slowdowns, problems with copying from NFS
to a Firwire disk ( systematic cmd_timeout at about 250 MB).
Do you have any advice ? should I test eepro100 NAPI driver ? 
I've try to play with ethtool(chang some eepro100 bits , like the
"sleeping" one ...
I have quitely the same card at home wich doesn't make any problem ( I
noticed some cmd_timeout when I changed my hub).
Is this hub related ? Is there a standart way autonegociation is working
( we use mostly cisco switches, are they compliant?).
We are actually trying to force 10FD or 100FD any new installed card
because we think this is the best way to avoid performances problem ...
Thanks for any advice.
