I would suggest the opposite approach instead: make the PPC just support
isa_readx/isa_writex instead.
Much simpler, and doesn't need changes to (correct) driver sources.
I bet that the patch will be smaller too. It's a simple case of
 - do the ioremap() _once_ at bootup, save the result in a static
   variable somewhere.
 - implement the (one-liner) isa_readx/isa_writex functions.
On many architectures you don't even need to do the ioremap, as it's
always available (same as on x86).
