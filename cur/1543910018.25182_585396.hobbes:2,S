From a user`s point of view, i like PlugSched.
It gives the average or inexperienced user the ability to switch between 
different schedulers and it empowers him to compare between them easily.
I like choice.
Ok, it`s not good to have too much of that, but it`s always good 
to have at least one or two alternatives.
No patch and no compile orgy for the end-user anymore - he can try if 
a different scheduler makes his stuttering audio go away or if his 
desktop-environment is more responsive with "itchysched" than 
with "scratchysched".
Take this as a user`s vote for PlugSched.
There are pluggable I/O schedulers in Linux for years now, there was 
that switch from AS to CFQ as the default - so please give us pluggable 
CPU schedulers, too ! :)

ps:
i trust you kernel developers know what you are doing, but if scares me
a little bit, that some integral and living part like O(1) being ripped off 
and being replaced by something new.

Having a framework for giving people the choice between different 
solutions usually sounds good in theory, but in practice there's the 
often underestimated high price of people using a different solution 
instead of reporting a problem with one solution or people adding 
features to only one of the solutions resulting in different solutions 
having different features and bugs instead of one solution with all 
features and bug fixes.
So you should give a good technical explanation why it's not technically 
possible or not desirable for one solution to work well for everyone.
