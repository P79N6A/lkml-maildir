  Oh, yeah. Of course PAM is broken. We need to embed telepathy in PAM
  IMMEDEATELY !

 Or you can fix PAM so it will use full name after THAT
  -- cut --
      if ((tty = rindex(ttyn, '/')))
        ++tty;
      else
        tty = ttyn;
  -- cut --
  snippet from login.c ? PAM module was NEVER supplied with full device name
  to begin with. Add tiny patch to your login.c (from unix-utils) and stop
  blaming the innocent PAM.
sorry, i just presumed the brokenness was in PAM. thanks for pointing
the correct source of the problem. You should that submit that patch
to the utils-linux maintainer.
