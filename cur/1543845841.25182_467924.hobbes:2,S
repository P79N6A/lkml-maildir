you should be getting an interrupt every two seconds from the eth0
(e1000) driver.  You are having interrupt delivery problems probably
due to something screwing up interrupt routing in the kernel.
Normally these issues are associated with MSI interrupts but your
adapter doesn't support those and is using generic IRQ
I'm guessing that if you somehow enable interrupts on your vga card on
the same bus as e1000 (bus 3) it will have interrupt delivery problems
as well.  Maybe try xorg?
