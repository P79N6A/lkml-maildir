Correct.

You however missed an important case here.  If attack B is outside 
UNTION(task->skill,  task->luck) protection A is *NOT* smoke-and-mirrors.
And for the *vast* majority of attackers, if they have a canned exploit for
A and it doesn't work, they'll be stuck because B is outside their ability.
