We used to see freezes more frequently (on both 2.6.16.18 and
2.6.14.2) before setting these tweaks:
- increase PCI latency of bttv device
- disable overlay on bttv driver
- enable HPET support for Character Devices
- disable "load DRI" in xorg.conf
After the tweaks, all 10 PCs have been under stress test for 48 hours,
and the first crash was on the 2.6.14.2. We will upgrade 3 more PCs to
2.6.16.18 today, to increase the probability of crashing on that
kernel.
Will keep you posted.
Regards
Keith
