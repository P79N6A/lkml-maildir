I saw the same.
In the end, it was broken RAM. Even if it had worked good on a previous
Asus MB + K6III, even if it *now* works ok on the same system, on the
Athlon one it was causing many *different* problems (random crashes).

this seems to be a 0, with a "wrong" bit set to 1. I had the same
(it was 000000c0). If it's a constan (one bit changed) in your oops,
you should really check your RAM.
