Subject: [patch 0/4] /proc/kmsg permissions, take three

Here's a re-revised version of my patch set to allow klogd to drop
privileges and continue reading from /proc/kmsg (currently, even if klogd
has a legitimately opened fd on /proc/kmsg, it cannot read from it unless
it has CAP_SYS_ADMIN asserted).  SELinux's pickier and finer-grained
privilege rules for /proc/kmsg are unchanged.
The major change from the previous patchset
[q.v. 
http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/466034
 ] is that,
as Arjan van de Ven requested, the new header linux/klog.h contains only
userspace-visible definitions (the constants for sys_syslog()).  Thanks to
Alexey Dobriyan for telling me the proper place to put the KLOGSEC_*
constants (now renamed LSM_KLOG_* in keeping with other such constants).
They have also been rediffed versus yesterday's git.  They should be
applied in sequence; each step compiles, and the complete set has been
booted and tested to work as intended.
Any comments, as usual, appreciated.  I would very much like to see this
in 2.6.20.
