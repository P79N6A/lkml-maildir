There is at least one case that ramfs works but tmpfs doesn't.
If you have a loopback file A, and the following will fail in 2.4:
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt/tmp
extract file A to /mnt/tmp/A
mount -t ext2 -o loop /mnt/tmp /mnt/loopback
You'll get "ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: Invalid argument".
But ramfs works great.
Is this a bug or feature?
