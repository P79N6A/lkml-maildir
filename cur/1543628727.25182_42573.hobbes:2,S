Subject: [BK-Patch-2.5.10] NTFS 2.0.3 submission for kernel inclusion

Linus,
Following my submission of NTFS 2.0.2 Andrew Morton emailed me with a
list of minor issues he found when reviewing the code. So I have updated
NTFS to 2.0.3, fixing all reported bugs as well as applying an
optimisation I had planned for a while and throwing out some dead code
out. The result has been stress tested for over an hour and was fine.
It would be great if you would do a bk pull from the ntfs tng bkbits
repository:
        bk://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-tng-2.5
If you would prefer a bitkeeper patch inline with an email, please let
me know and I will generate one and email it to you ASAP...
ps. For all non-bitkeeper users, normal diff -urNp patches for 2.5.10
vanilla as well as an incremental patch from 2.5.10+ntfs-2.0.2 to
ntfs-2.0.3 are available from Sourceforge:

Best regards,
        Anton
