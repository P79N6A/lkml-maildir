A GPL library can only be linked with other GPL-compatible code.  A LGPL
library can be linked with any GPL-compatible or GPL-incompatible code.
The LGPL has specific clauses in it that allows you to link GPL-incompatible
code (see LGPL paragraph 5).  It seems that you're missing that distinction.
This is why glibc and other libraries are LGPL, not GPL.  If glibc was GPL,
all the binary-only applications in user space would have to supply their
own C library.
