Too many people think they want it because they don't really

Message passing must be more efficient than DSM. We are talking about
clusters, not a single SMP machine. The reason is that DSM *must* sit
on top of a transport layer (aka message passing).

If you mean within a single, (hardware) shared memory computer, then
yes. Otherwise, no. And DSM is all about pretending you have shared
memory across a network of computers.
