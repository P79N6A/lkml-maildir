Because KDE people  hate Gnome people and vice  versa, and because the
rest of the world just neglects the two races for political reasons.
Maybe   the  Freedesktop  project   should  provide   some  convenient
specification/code to  do it.  Like they  do for HAL  and DBUS (Please
note that this is something  interesting because it does clever things
on hardware without requiring to patch the kernel.)

If the distributors  really want to be able to gain  money, and if the
Free Unix community wants to  gain a significant market share, this is
supposed to  happen. It's  the question of  whether we can  ignore our
childish concept  wars, or if we're  always going to stay  at that low
level we're at now.
Actually, this can't be fixed by putting everything into the kernel.
