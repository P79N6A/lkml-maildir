I just looked at the source; I forgot `make checkstack' existed.
On this system:
0xc0263e0f pkt_open [vmlinux]:                          556
which is nearly as bad.
(As an aside, I'm surprised I didn't oops when packet-writing as well:
0xc021270d udf_process_sequence [vmlinux]:              692
0xc020f43d udf_add_entry [vmlinux]:                     628
owch. I guess that's called via a shorter call chain...)
I'll try the patch after this series of backups is done :)
