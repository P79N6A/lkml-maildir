Could you please try this patch.  I think the lenght should be 8, not 7. Yep
that should do the trick.  Thanks for finding this bug.

Hmm, I don't think the driver should be unregistered on a probe failure, it
should be registered on a module unload.  It's the driver's job to clean
things up so it can accept another match if one comes up.

A lot of things have changed, I'll take a look.
