I grabbed your latest patch and started to merge it with my latest work on 
the matrox driver. As soon as I'm done merging my matrox changes I will 
send you a patch right away.

Try the latest patch I released.

pseudo_palette was originally designed to be a pointer to some kind of 
data for color register programming. For example many PPC graphics cards 
have a color register region. Now you could have that point to 
pseudo_palette.  Note pseudo_palette is only visiable in fbmem.c for the 
logo drawing code. Personally I liek to see that hidden.

??? Does your accel engine require these kinds of values?
