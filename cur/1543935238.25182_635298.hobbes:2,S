1. Why does VMware need max_cstate=1 to load quickly?
   It should not, and the fact that it does means
   that something somewhere is seriously broken.
2. Why does the "max_csate=1" workaround help only
   on the dual-core boxes, while the single-core
   boxes still fail to load quickly?
I'm glad that we deleted run-time access to max_cstate --
it seems to have exposed a real bug that needs fixing
and has gone unreported until now.
Indeed, when the real bug is fixed, I propose that
we again move to delete max_cstate as a run-time API.
