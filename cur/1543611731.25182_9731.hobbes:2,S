I found the reason for these messages. It has a boot-script source.
Mandrake stores the attributes of device nodes in /lib/dev-state.
This directory is copied into /dev directly before devfsd is started.
If there is a device file in /lib/dev-state it is created in /dev even before 
the driver is loaded.
When the driver is loaded it tries again to create the node and the message 
appears. 
Thanks for your suggestions and remarks.
greetings 
Christian
