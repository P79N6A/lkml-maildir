The build year is nowhere as helpful as 'lspci -vv' output. Then, given that your vaio is equipped
with tifm controller, you'll have to build the driver with debugging enabled and send me the
relevant excerpt of your system log.
You should have the following modules loaded, by the way:
memstick
mspro_block
tifm_core
tifm_7xx1
tifm_ms
The autoloading is handled via udev (so the relevant rules are not there yet).
