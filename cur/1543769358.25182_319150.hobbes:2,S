Mixing is IMHO action that should be in kernel because
1) needs realtime scheduling to keep latency down
2) needs tight cooperation with the hardware to prevent dropouts
on underruns
3) Is a trivial linear algorithm involving memory blocks and linear
   arithmetic, no complicated computations that are difficult to
   check for BugFree(TM) so shouldn't present a great risk on kernel
   stability
4) Fits into the kernel philosophy. Kernel is a program meant to provide
   time-sharing access to limited hardware resource. Sound card is a
   limited hardware resource.
5) From the knowledge of the exact hardware, the mixing routine in
   kernel can know maximum allowable levels etc. to prevent clipping.
