Yep.  Though I tend to look at the whole problem as "autoconfiguration"
lately.  Solving device naming (even the major/minor subproblem) is only
one part of having a complete autoconfiguration infrastructure.

Well, "completely" goes too far IMO.  Unless by "identifier" you imply
something of which there's only one?  In my book, devices can have many
kinds of identifiers.
The reason is that such "physical" identifiers (or "device topology" IDs)
may be all that's available to distinguish some devices.  For example,
network adapters (no major/minor numbers :) and parallel/printer/serial
ports may have no better "stable" (over reboots) identifier available.
Without "stable" names, it's too easy to have bad things happen, like
your "confidential materials" printer output get redirected into the
lobby printer, or trust your network DMZ as if it were the internal
network.  Given hotplugging, I think the best solution to such issues
does involve exposing topological IDs such as PCI slot names.
(What IDs the different applications use is a different issue.)
