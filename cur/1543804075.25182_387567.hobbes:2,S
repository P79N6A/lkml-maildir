Nasty.  I hope someone else can suggest something constructive.

Well, it might: I've not been able to explain that at all, so cannot
rule out a relation to your reboots.  The st problem (Bad page state,
mapcount 2 while count 0, from sgl_unmap_user_pages) ought to be a lot
easier to debug than a random reboot: but I've still no suggestion.
