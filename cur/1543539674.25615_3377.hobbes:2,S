binfmt_elf.c:load_aout_interp() uses file->f_op->read to read the interpreter
from disk, so actually need to use something else to flush the cache.
Similar for two of three cases in binfmt_aout.c.  For these the page
fault won't sufficiently flush cashes.

There is another MIPS specific problem with this routine.  Originally
introduced for kernel modules the various incarnations of flush_icache_range
are not protected against access from userspace.  Unable to handle kernel
paging request ahead ...
The other question is why we still have support for a.out ELF interpreters
in current kernels.  I think it's more apropriate to create a patch which
disables support for a.out ELF interpreters for architectures which like
MIPS don't have an a.out history than fixing above problem thereby also
saving a bit of memory.
