I posted an apm patch and asked Marcelo to apply it. What you do see is
kapm-idled and the idle task both racing for idle time. There's even more
problems (search lkml for subject kapm-idled and have a look at the reply from
Alan Cox on Dec 5 which does contain my original mail and the patch). With the
patch e.g. the fan control of my laptop works properly which it never did
before. If you really do have a broken bios there's no other way than to
contact your system's vendor.
