so ... this should be #ifndef ia64?
to all the purists: this cannot be done via VM_DATA_DEFAULT_FLAGS, because
some architectures enforce the X bit, some dont. In fact only ia64 seems
to enforce it reliably for all binaries.
the #ifdef could be made an arch inline or define. But it's really
academic as only ia64 seems to have this problem. So i'd suggest the patch
below.
