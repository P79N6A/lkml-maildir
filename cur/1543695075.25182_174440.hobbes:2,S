It *may* happen that some things work a bit differently. This needn't be
an exact compiler error. It may be a Linux kernel source error. However,
these things are quite subtle so it might break things and you only see
it after a month or two, when you on-HDD data is already gone...
Changes like that need good tests and can't be done in a 2.4.x kernel
becase it may harm people's data or stability. These changes need to be
done in development kernels, hopefully when they start off, not when
they settle down to become the next stable release, though...
