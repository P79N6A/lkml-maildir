getting those return mail messages. He can read LKML or you can re-CC

Now I can slap my forehead!  Duh, I wasn't seeing that ! in front of the
rcu_pending condition in the rcu_try_flip_idle.  We only flip if we do
indeed have something pending. I need some sleep. I also need to
re-evaluate some of my analysis of that code. But it doesn't change my
opinion of the stages.

But until others besides yourself understand that state machine (doesn't
really need to be me) I would be worried about applying it without
barriers.  The barriers may add a bit of overhead, but it adds some
confidence in the code.  I'm arguing that we have barriers in there until
there's a fine understanding of why we fail with 3 stages and not 4.
Perhaps you don't have a box with enough cpus to fail at 4.
I don't know how the higher ups in the kernel command line feel, but I
think that memory barriers on critical sections are justified. But if you
can show a proof that adding extra stages is sufficient to deal with
CPUS moving memory writes around, then so be it. But I'm still not
convinced that these extra stages are really solving the bug instead of
just making it much less likely to happen.
Ingo praised this code since it had several years of testing in the RT
tree. But that version has barriers, so this new verison without the
barriers has not had that "run it through the grinder" feeling to it.

hehe, I do need sleep I meant the boosting portion.

True.
