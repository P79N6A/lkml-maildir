Subject: [patch 0/3] Implement CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC for RTC_DRV_CMOS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The new rtc-cmos driver misses HPET support. If the hardware has HPET enabled,
then interrupts don't work for the rtc-cmos driver which results in RTC_AIE*,
RTC_PIE* and RTC_ALM being unusable. This affects hwclock from util-linux-ng
at least on i386 since that uses RTC_PIE_ON. (For x86-64, a polling method is
used for unknown reasons.)
This patch series now
  1. export the functions from arch/x86/kernel/hpet.c that the old char/rtc
     driver uses to work around that problem,
  2. makes it possible to compile the old rtc driver as module, while still
     having CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC enabled and
  3. makes use of the exported functions in (1) in the new rtc-cmos driver.
The design is not changed. Please review and give me feedback!
This patch series is against 2.6.24-rc5-mm1. It passes the test in
Documentation/rtc.txt after 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/20/249
 is applied.
