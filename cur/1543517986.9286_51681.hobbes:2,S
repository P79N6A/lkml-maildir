Hi guys,
I was about to remove lock/unlock_kernel in ipc/util.c:ipc_alloc/free
around vmalloc/vfree but having a closer look at vmalloc/vfree it looks
like they (or rather get_vm_area() and vfree()) are not
SMP-safe - they manipulate vmlist without any locking.  Shouldn't we have
something like a spinlock_t vmlist_lock?
It doesn't look like we ever sleep while walking vmlist so perhaps a
generic spinlock will do?
(After my fiasco with attempting to implement something similar for
modlist_lock I think I better ask your opinion first)
Regards,
Tigran.
