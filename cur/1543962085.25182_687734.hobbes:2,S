That encourages developers to continue ignoring that stabilizing work.
The stall does have a side effect of refocussing them. A branch for -rc
and a monthly cycle would be interesting as it would mean that the
pushback for not fixing stability problems would be not getting you work
pulled for the main tree if you didn't fix the bugs first - and could be
both sufficient an incentive and not too vicious as it would be with a 2
month cycle.
