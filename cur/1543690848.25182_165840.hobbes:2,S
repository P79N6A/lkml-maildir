My Presario 12XL325 laptop is having a number of problems (see bugzilla 
973).  During late test4 or early test5 it started refusing to properly 
initialize my wireless ethernet card, an SMC2632W.  I am getting the 
following output when the card is inserted:
Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
PCI: Assigned IRQ 9 for device 0000:00:0a.0

0xe0000-0xfffff

orinoco_cs.c 0.13e (David Gibson <hermes@gibson.dropbear.id.au> and 
others)
orinoco_cs: RequestIRQ: Unsupported mode
I recall having the problem with RequestIRQ earlier in the 2.5 series, but 
it went away.  It now looks like it is back.  I have attached files with 
the following debugging info:
config file used to build the kernel
/proc/cpuinfo
dmesg output
/proc/interrupts
/proc/ioports
lspci output
ver_linux output
I hope this helps
