CONFIG_INET_ECN does exactly what you want.
If you turn it on, ECN is on by default.
If you turn it off, ECN is off by default.
The ECN support itself, is always compiled into the
kernel.  CONFIG_INET_ECN only determines the initial
setting of the ecn sysctl.
Your patch adds zero functionality and only serves to make
the cofiguration more complicated.
