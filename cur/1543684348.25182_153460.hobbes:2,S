OK, thanks for the update.  It was puzzling to see this stuff
in such a state ... I've got a few patches for USB PM that are
worth putting back in advance of that, but it seems like real
testing will need to wait until "next month".  (Tomorrow!)

Yes, that's no problem.  It looks like:
   static int my_suspend(struct device *_intf, u32 state, u32 level)
   {
       struct usb_interface   *intf;
       int                    retval = 0;
       intf = to_usb_interface(_intf);
       switch (level) {
       ... cases are yet to stabilize ...
       }
       return retval;
   }
   ... similar for resume()
   static struct usb_driver my_driver {
        .owner =      THIS_MODULE,
        .name =       "MyFirstDriver",
        .probe =      my_probe,
        .disconnect = my_disconnect,
        .id_table =   my_id_table,
        .driver = {
              .suspend =    my_suspend,
              .resume =     my_resume,
         },
    };
But until the suspend()/resume() callback API stabilizes, it's
mostly useful to know that it'll be exactly that simple, and
that usbcore doesn't get in the way.
I suspect that USB should do some non-global PM stuff too.
Hub ports can be suspended when the devices connected to them
are idle for long enough ... that's not something I'd expect
system-wide PM policies to address.
