I am not sure what you are trying to do with walk_memory_resource(). The
behavior is different on ppc64. Hotplug memory usage assumes that all
the memory resources (all system memory, not just IOMEM) are represented
in /proc/iomem. Its the case with i386 and ia64. But on ppc64 is
contains ONLY iomem related. Paulus didn't want to export all the system
memory into /proc/iomem on ppc64. So I had to workaround by providing
arch-specific walk_memory_resource() function for ppc64.
