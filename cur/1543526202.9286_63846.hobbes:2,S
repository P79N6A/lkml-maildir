Actually, some floppy controllers (back in the days when the 8088 and
8086 processors ruled the PC world) included 8k of RAM on board, and
would stream an entire track into it as soon as any sector on that
track was requested. As a result, his suggestion isn't unrealistic.

The actual procedure is for the driver to request the whole kernel,
take whatever it gets back, and then repeatedly request the rest,
displaying a dot after each successful read.

I have four systems at home that behave completely differently in this
respect when used with EXACTLY THE SAME boot disk:
 1. My print server clearly provides one track per read, and
    displays 56 dots as a result.
 2. My gateway clearly provides one CYLINDER per read, and
    displays 28 dots as a result.
 3. My Windows test station clearly provides 32k per read,
    and displays 16 dots as a result.
 4. My Linux workstation clearly provides 64k per read, and
    displays 8 dots as a result.
It would therefore NOT surprise me to discover that systems exist that
can provide the entire floppy at a single read, and would thus display
only a single dot.

We obviously have our kernels compiled differently as the one I use
occupies roundup(497k/9k) = 56 tracks = 28 cylinders.
Best wishes from Riley.
