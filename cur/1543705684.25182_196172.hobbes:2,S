The OF device-tree isn't in sysfs, it's in /proc/device-tree, we never
"ported" that code to sysfs for various reasons. I could start doing
so but I'm afraid I won't have time to do that before 2.6.3 and I
really want something in asap so I can finally fix the bootloader setup
and XFree once for all...
Now, if you consider a symlink to /proc/device-tree acceptable... :)
Ben.
