   Rather than fix the old udiv128 function, which was trying to do
   128/128 bit division, I've pulled in a subroutine from libgcc that
   does 128/64 bit division, which is all we need here.
   So it should be a bit faster than the old routine, for what ever
   that's worth to someone who is already trapping into the kernel...
Is this a serious patch submission or just a call for testing?  If the
former, I need to cook up the sparc bits once it gets in :-)
Later,
