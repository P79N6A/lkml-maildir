Unfortunately Belkin have sold both RT73 and RT2500 devices with
that USB ID. You don't say what distro you are runing or what version
of RT2x00 it ships with but last time I checked with the git version of
rt2x00 it tried to load both drivers but the rt2500 driver noticed it was the 
wrong hardware and shut down.
My Belkin stick is busy right now but I'll test that still works later.

There are a few such devices but they are all cases where there are reliable 
reports of manufacturers shipping both device types with one USB ID. There 
are some cases where the alternate chipset with the same USB ID isn't even a 
ralink device but there isn't much we can do about those.
