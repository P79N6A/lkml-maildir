That is most likely unrelated, but I had similar experiences
at times.  It turned out that something done recently in APIC
management code did break things, but lattest version is again
working.   For a while to have network card working I had to boot
with  "noapic"  option in my home SMP box.
In an UP box it is about same to boot as "noapic", but in SMP it
does result in "one CPU does all interrupts" thingie.  (In some
rare cases it could be desirable, even.)
