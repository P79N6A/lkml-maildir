It's not a unique identifier since it can be used for multiple items 
(like it is for virtqueues configs).

But PCI device configuration is not stateful.  If you care about letting 
the host know what features a guest understands, I think something more 
explicit and stateful should be used.  For instance, a feature register 
that stores a bitmap.
Otherwise, the host has to infer based on what fields that guest has 
read what features the guest actually supports.  That seems error prone 
to me.

What do you think of what I proposed?  It seems simpler to me.
