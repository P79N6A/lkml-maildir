Andi, there may be two reasons of this behavior:
1. skb that triggered ARP request had a.b.c.1 source, either because
   a) the socket had been bound to that address, or
   b) preferred source in the routing table is wrong;
2. the request source address was selected basing on interface address list,
   and produced a wrong result.
I would say that 1b case is the least likely for me.
If the reason of this behavior is 1a or 2, it's a kernel bug in my opinion.
David, could you try to replace the first `if' statement in arp_solicit() by
simple
	saddr = inet_select_addr(dev, target, RT_SCOPE_LINK);
It doesn't harm in any case, and will allow to distinguish cases #1 and #2.
Best regards
