NAK
The entire point of inb_pic/outb_pic is to isolate the various methods
and keep the logic for delays in one place. Undoing this just creates a
nasty mess.
Quite probably inb_pic/outb_pic will end up as static inlines that do inb
or outb with a udelay of 1 or 2 but that is where the knowledge belongs.
