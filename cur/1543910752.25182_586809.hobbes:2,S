Yes.

Usually current == sender, but if the signal was sent from interrupt
context, current is some random process.

get_signal_to_deliver() might resend a signal, but only when current is
ptraced. In that case the signal will be delivered even if we are init,
no problem. (except that ptracing of sub-namespace init is problem by
itself).
