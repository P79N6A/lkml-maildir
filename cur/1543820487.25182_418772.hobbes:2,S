You have defeated me. My unabridged Webster does
not define "conflating" or even conflat, and I
guess that I'm too unhip to be up on it's modern
usage. Before I disagree with you, I'd like to
know what I've been charged with!

Except that every single time I'm meet with
SELinux developers they have emphasised how
important it is to use the Official Policies.

Truth.

Yes. And a complete system policy is enormous.
500,000 rules and growing, last I heard.

In Orange Book terms this was known as policy
not applying to all objects.

Except that MAC is NOT enabled by default, it is
available by default. Only those programs and objects
identified by the policy are constrained.

I'm old, so I won't say they're "very well"
documented,
but they are documented. The limitations of the
targeted
policy rarely show up in the glossy, however.

Yup. The policy description would still be large.

Yes it is. It works, I admit. There are even
applications
I'd suggest it be used for.

Can't do that. The mechanism require large, complex
policies.

The underlying mechanisms are more complex than
Bell & LePadula MAC + Biba Integrity + POSIX Caps.
I am not trying to knock SELinux (too hard) in
this discussion. I do want to point out that many
of the arguements being used against alternatives
apply to SELinux as well. I do not understand why
SELinux developers feel so threatened by alternatives.
