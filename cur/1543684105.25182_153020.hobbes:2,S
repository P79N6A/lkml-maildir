g++ >=3.2 use 486-specific instructions in order to do atomic operations
in C++ code. 3.3 includes a 386 version of the same code, but it's not
possible to use a mixture of the two (ie, code compiled with a "486" g++
will not work on the "386" version), and so to keep ABI compatibility
with the other distributions it's necessary to break 386. The "obvious"
solution (dragging this back on topic) is a kernel patch to emulate 486
instructions on a 386.
