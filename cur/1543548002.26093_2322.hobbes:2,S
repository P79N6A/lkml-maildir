This is true as long as the debugger hooks have no (or very minimal) impact
on the instrumented system. Impossible (or very nearly so) in the case of a
massively parallel program like the kernel. Where it is possible it has
been done, in general. General hooks into the distributed subsystems inside
the kernel are only a bit easier to maintain than the instrumented code,
and they impact its performance, stability and readability.
You did not build a logic analyzer and circuit simulator into each and
every transmitter you built, did you?
I've used debuggers too, and do so sometimes to check on stuff I write when
I'm truly stumped, but in general I stay away from them. I (try to) write
stuff in modular, cleanly separate parts with (I hope) well understood
interactions. That makes isolating bugs easy enough without a detailed
step-by-step following of the program, at least most of the time. Debuggers
_can_ be useful, no question about that. But you can also waste a huge
amount of time with them. They just give you _one_ very narrow picture of
what is going on, and that picture is from a quite useless perspective most
of the time.
