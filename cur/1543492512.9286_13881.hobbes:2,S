Actually, I don't think it should work _either_ way;  this is why I say a
capability-enhanced binary should be immutable.  Before you can write to
the file, you must first un-set the capability flag.  Then you modify it,
then you _attempt_ to re-set it.  Before the flag gets set the kernel
checks the capelf headers for being legally settable; this includes the
caps, and the actual file owner and setuid bit, since for a
capability-enhanced binary we use the fs representation of owner and
setuid as a flag.  The user process must have 'CAP_SETFCAP' raised to be
able to set/unset the cap flag.  Works nicely for all uid's, as proper for
a capability-based system.

Well, if we agree to store the actual uid and setuid bit in the capelf
headers, then we _can_ have a capability enhanced binary that's also
setuid to another user.

Eh, but in a capabilities-based system, _any_ user might have the
capability to make a capability-enhanced binary (might have CAP_SETFCAP
raised).
For a good time: read the linux-privs spec and try to make sense of the
formula for the way a new process gets it's capabilities.  heh... ugly.
Here's another thought, though.  I'm not real crazy about having to store
real uid + suid flag in the headers.  Can we just use, say, the 'sticky'
bit on files to flag a binary as capability-enhanced?  It would _still_
need to make the file immutable, and setting the bit would _still_ require
CAP_SETFCAP set, plus the other checks; but it'd sure play a hell of a lot
nicer with the VFS wrt actual uid & suid bit...
