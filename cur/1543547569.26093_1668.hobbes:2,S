I can link my kernel statically with binary-only modules as long as I
want.  I don't redistribute it and I just use it inhouse. This is my
personal decision and it has nothing to do with GPL. _IF_ I would ship
such a kernel, then I would be in violation of GPL.
If I give you a binary-only module which can either be loaded as a
driver or, maybe with some glue code, linked into the kernel and some
instructions how to do this, I am _not_at_all_ in violation of any
GPL. Because I distribute only my code under my license. If you follow
my instructions and link a kernel and use it, you're not in violation
of GPL because you don't distribute anything.
If you follow the instructions _and_ distribute the result, then you're in 
violation. So your point is moot.

Yes. But not before. And _I_ am violating the GPL, not M-Systems. 
Their licensing scheme just makes it for me impossible to distribute a
product with their driver. But that's _my_ problem not the problem of
M-Systems.

In Germany we have a saying: "Wo kein Klaeger, da kein Richter" (If
there is noone who sues, there is noone to judge"). This applies here,
too. Sue them and you will see.
But then again, to my knowledge noone, has yet tested if the GPL holds
in a lawsuit. Imagine what would happen if it does not.
