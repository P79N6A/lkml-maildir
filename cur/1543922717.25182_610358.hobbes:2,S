The configuration register used to to reclaim DRAM lost to an MMIO
hole was introduced with revision E of the gen1 Opterons.  (This
feature is supposed to work both in interleaved and non-interleaved
mode.)  What does /proc/cpuinfo say?  (On both?)
(Still, even without this your BIOS should be able to map your memory
so that you are able to use all 4G.  Provided you disable
interleaving, I can't see that there's anything stopping the BIOS from
mapping the memory from node 1 to 0-2G and the memory from node 2 to
4-6G, leaving a 2G hole for MMIO and other junk.  Whether your BIOS
actually supports this is another matter.)
