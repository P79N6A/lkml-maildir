Hi,
The kernel/exit.c:put_files_struct() and close_files() are very nice as
they show how to walk open fds (and close them) and how to free the fd
array/sets in one go. But is there a _very fast_ way of getting the number
of fds currently open (without having to walk the sets and test the bits)?
Regards,
Tigran
