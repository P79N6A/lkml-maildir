Wouldn't this remove some of the usefulness of the timerfd?
For example, if a timerfd is one of the fd's that is returned by a
epoll_wait syscall, you manually need to do the mapping between the
timerfd and the timerid in order to be able to modify the timer.
The advantage of solution b) above is that the fd is everything that is
needed to work with the timer. With solution c) you have to keep two
references to the same timer around and use one of them depending on what
you want to do with the timer.
Also, if the timerfd is close():d, does that remove the underlying timer
(invalidate the timerid) as well?
