The task migration is one of the easier bits, there is a hive of other 
problems which crop up in the various subsystems, the current patchset 
does very well however, Tim perhaps you'd like to help out? 
For interrupts we simple set interrupt affinity mask on the interrupt 
controller whilst the processor is still online, quiesce, 
local_irq_disable. The wait period is to make sure that interrupts which 
are already queued get handled before we completely disable interrupt 
processing, although it could do with some verification to make sure 
there aren't any lingering vectors.
