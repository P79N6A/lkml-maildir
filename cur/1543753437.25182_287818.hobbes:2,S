Great!

Yes, see next_timer_interrupt() for that. The interrupt loop should
be pretty much the same on all archs. Then calling the timer
interrupt from other interrupts removes any latency issues with the
timer. But that's pretty much all the patch does.

Yes, the idle module should probably be in drivers/acpi or something
to allow loading other custom PM modules.

Oops, ltt, is probably left-over from low-tick-timer that I used
first as a name... I'll fix that :)

Hmmm, maybe it's not needed any longer? Have to try it out. I had
some issues with SMP when I started doing the patch.

Yeah, there's not much shared code yet, when I started I expected to
share more code between ARM and x86. But the timer framework is
quite arch specific. So far only registering and /sys control to 
enable seems common. Maybe some inline functions too, but a common 
header might be enough.
