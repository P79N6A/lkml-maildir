Hi folks,
in the process of analyzing the frequent crashes during the snd-nm256
module insertion I stumbled across the following register values
(reading 32bit words at a time in a loop with pcitweak):
--- nm256-crashes-sometimes	2006-03-26 15:27:32.873773008 +0200
+++ nm256-never-crashed-so-far	2006-03-26 15:27:42.669283864 +0200

 0xf9f0f800
 0x00000000
This would be in word #7 (starting from 0), 0010 0010 vs. 1010 0010. I
tried to write back the "safer" values to the chip, but reading them
back sometimes showed that the write had failed, probably due to the
registers being locked.
I'd very much like to do the "correction" in the driver itself, and
maybe have it tested on other laptops as well - I have only a Dell
Latitude CPiA (NM2200) for that purpose, and no other incarnation of the
neomagic chip at hand. Also, for starters it would be very interesting
to see similar dumps on other machines, to see if the difference between
working and hardlocking is the same.

(was taken while actually playing sound - guess I should take a dump
every time I am about to insert the module and look for differences...)
I am currently stuck here, so any hint would be appreciated : )
Kind regards,
Chris
