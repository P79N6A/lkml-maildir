Hi!
I'm trying to get "IPWireless 3G PCMCIA" to work under linux. There
are two problems:
* first, only available version is for 2.6.12, and fixes to make it
compile under 2.6.16 don't seem to be trivial
What is worse,
/*
 * IPWireless 3G PCMCIA Network Driver
 *
 *   by Stephen Blackheath <stephen@blacksapphire.com>,
 *      Ben Martel <benm@symmetric.co.nz>
 *
 * Copyrighted as follows:
 *   Copyright (C) 2004 by Symmetric Systems Ltd (NZ)
 */
...so I'm not even allowed to fix it. I believe that driver should be
GPLed -- it is unusable without pcmcia packages after all.
Can you clarify copyright situation? Does anyone have 2.6.16 version
by chance?
