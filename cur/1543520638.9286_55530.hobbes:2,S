Hi,
I have a really peculiar situation, so please excuse me if it is a silly or 
unfeasible requirement. But I really need it for one of my modules and any 
help in this regard will be appreciated.
The problem statement goes as follows:
I am working in the TCP/IP layer of the Linux kernel. Whenever any client 
contacts this server all the client packets i.e. the sk_buff are queued in 
my own queue(a linked list). Hence for each TCP connection I have in my 
queue packets from SYN to the end of connection(FIN or ACK). Once the 
connection is completed, I am trying to simulate the same connection again 
with the queued pakcets and this will be within the machine (i.e. packets 
dont go out to the n/w). Of course this involves changing the  sequence 
numbers of the queued packets so that the server will accept them, since 
the server's ISN during simulation will be different.
I am working in the ip_output.c file where I send my SYN packet to the 
upper layers. This packet is recd and a SYN-ACK is also sent by the TCP. 
Now in the same file, when the server's response comes down, I trap this, 
check if it is my response and then send the ACK packet from my queue after 
modifications. But the problem which is now arising is that when I send my 
ACK packet to complete the 3-way handshake, the sk->state will be still be 
in LISTEN and TCP will reject any ACK packets in this state. So could 
anyone please tell me how do I wait in a loop for the state to become 
SYN_RECV before sending the next packet. Or are there any other approaches 
for this problem?
I am really sorry for the long question but any help will be great. BTW I 
am using kernel 2.2.5
TIA.
bye
Vinu
