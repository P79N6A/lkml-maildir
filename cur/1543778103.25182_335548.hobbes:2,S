	Seems like an excellent suggestion to me! Yeah, it may be possible to
maintain the context the kernel keeps on a per-class basis instead of
globally or per-process. The real question is what constitutes a useful
"extension" :).
	I was thinking that per-class nice values might be a good place to
start as well. One advantage of per-class as opposed to per-process nice
is the class is less transient than the process since its lifetime is
determined solely by the system administrator.
	CKRM calls this kind of module a "resource controller". There's a small
HOWTO on writing resource controllers here:
http://ckrm.sourceforge.net/ckrm-controller-howto.txt
If anyone wants to investigate writing such a controller please feel
free to ask questions or send HOWTO feedback on the CKRM-Tech mailing
list at <ckrm-tech@lists.sourceforge.net>.
