Adrian, will you please differentiate between symbols which are
logically part of an API and symbols that were for some purpose and are
not now being used.
This sort of symbol removal/marking is just causing noise and confusion
without actually doing anything useful, unlike the many symbols that
genuinely were exported for some weird reason and were no longer needed.
