Another fix would be to have a global variable "dontunmap" and have
the map kernel function not change the pte. But this is also not the

The problem with atomic operations is the difficulty of keeping state. The
state must essentially all be bound to the atomic value replaced otherwise
more extensive locking schemes are needed.
