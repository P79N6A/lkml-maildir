Please read again. I've already touched all the pages, as you suggested.
Maybe i'm not been clear:
1) process A malloc()s 1MB. It DOES touch them, right after malloc().
2) process B malloc()s 128MB. It does NOT touch all of them. Only some.
3) process C malloc()s 128MB. It does NOT touch all of them.
4) process C starts accessing its pages sequentially. RAM gets allocated.
5) RAM is short (suppose 64MB). the system starts paging-out A, B, C pages. 
   Here are you sure that A swap space is already allocated? I'm not. Anyway,
   let's assume it is.  As long as the systems pages out B and C pages,
   it allocates swap space. Sooner or later we're short of swap, because
   both B and C have address spaces larger than available swap (128MB - 1MB 
   taken by A).
   
6) A (who's been sleeping all the time) wakes up, accesses one of its pages.
   No page-frame is available, so the system tries to free one used by C
   or B. But no swap space is available. Page fault for process A fails
   to provide a free page-frame to A. Boom.

That's what *I*'ve been saying in previous messages. I'm not misunderstanding
malloc(). You are misunderstanding that your 'safe' process may still
page-fault. Even if its own pages are on swap, you may need to free
other processes pages, and you can't be sure *they* can be swapped out.

No. Only if ALL processes touch ALL pages after malloc() you are
(partially) safe. They also need NOT to grow their stacks, for example.
