This may work, but it is evidently the wrong change.
The helpers list desired by net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_*.c is
in net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper.c and it is not static there.
My analysis on your config being illegal, as pointed out by others, is
wrong technically.  But, something else is awry since
net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_core.o should not be built without
net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_nat_helper.o being built as well.
I'll hopefully solve this by the end of the day.
Later,
