Having all of the config options in a /proc/config file would be a
great help for people using my new bug database, because it would
allow them to upload the .config for their current kernel even if it
is not one they have compiled themselves.
At the moment, the facility to search for bugs via the config options
that cause them is only useful for people who are compiling their own
kernel.
