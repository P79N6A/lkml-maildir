Subject: Re: [PATCH] export iov_shorten for ext4's use
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

(And, take 2... follow the coding style on export declarations...)
ext4 needs to deal with 2 different max file offsets for block- and 
extent-allocated file formats, whereas the s_maxbytes scheme can only deal 
with one.  So, for block-allocated files, we must catch and fix up
too-large offsets from within the filesystem.
Having iov_shorten exported allows such things as:
		if (pos + length > sbi->s_bitmap_maxbytes) {
			nr_segs = iov_shorten((struct iovec *)iov, nr_segs,
					      sbi->s_bitmap_maxbytes - pos);
		}
to fix up too-large writes to these files in ext4_file_write().
This patch is currently living in the ext4 patch queue.
