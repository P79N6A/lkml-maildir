Subject: [PATCH] reserve end-of-conventional-memory to 1MB on 32-bit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The 32-bit code still uses reserve_bootmem, so this is not really
a unification with the 64-bit version of the ebda reservation code,
but at least it provides the same detection logic and reserves the
same areas.
This does not crash immediately on qemu. No further testing was
done! Otherwise:

Hello Ian, Ingo,
This patch should do the same reservations as the reserve_early
patch for 64 bit. Maybe you could try if this solves the problems
you are seeing with Xen?
On the other hand, Xen should be able to use those legacy ranges
as normal memory. Why doesn't it work? Does Xen use a special
bootloader? In that case it could just add the reservation to
the e820 memory map that is provided.
Another possible approach to the whole problem is just to ammend
the e820 memory map in the boot-code. Thanks to hpa, it is now easy
to change this code. Then the kernel can just trust the e820 memory
map, and only 'sophisticated' bootloaders need to do something
similar by themselves.
Greetings,
    Alexander
