Sam, Thanks!
No hurry, I was doing some clean ups when I came across that code, and 
said to myself "what an ugly hack!", and I wanted it fixed. The current 
hack works just fine, but it is an eye sore in the kernel.
I just wanted others to know that it needed to be cleaned up, and figured 
a post would help get it done.
Thanks,
