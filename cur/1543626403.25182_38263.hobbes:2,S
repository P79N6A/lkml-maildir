Hi,
 When i try compiling the Kernel for mips i get errors. The kernel is 2.4.17
downloaded from www.kernel.org. I have the mips developments environment
set. I have (hopefully) the right headers and have modified the makefile to
get the headers from those include directories.
 My main problem is changing the architecture from arch686 ( mine ) to mips.
How to i do this? What do i need to do inorder for the make to get the right
architecture? Or is there some other problem too?
 Here is the error listing
mipsel-linux-gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/tools/mipsel-linux/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe  -march=i686   -c -o init/main.o
init/main.c
cc1: bad value (i686) for -march= switch
Assembler messages:
Fatal error: invalid architecture -march=i686
make: *** [init/main.o] Error 2
Thanks and Regards,
Abdij
