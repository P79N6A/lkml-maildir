I have trouble with this patch. By your own admission this patch does 4 
different things which one patch shouldn't.

This is a bad idea. Subjecting a priority ceiling to kernel threads because 
they spend a long time idle is not the same as a user task that may be an 
idle bomb. Most kernel threads do sleep for extended periods and will always 
end up hitting this ceiling. That could lead to some difficult to understand 
latencies in scheduling of kernel threads, even if they are nice -5 because 
they'll expire very easily.

Bad again. This caused the biggest detriment on interbench numbers and is by 
far the most palpable interactivity killer in linux. I/O hurts us lots and 
this change will be very noticeable.

Why? Makes no sense. You end up getting hiccups in the rise of priority of 
tasks instead of it happening smoothly with sleep.

Seems fine.
