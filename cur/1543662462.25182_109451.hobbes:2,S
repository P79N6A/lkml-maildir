We'll see how time-consuming it is, I'll try my best to keep up!
Could you send me what you have collected for 2.5.60?  I've set up a
placeholder on the ltp website, you can either go to ltp.sf.net and
click on "Kernel Errata" or the direct URL is
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/errata
 but there's nothing there yet.  I'll
try to put some data out there tonight.
Thanks,
