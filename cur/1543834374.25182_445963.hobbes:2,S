OK, thanks.  Marking the TSC as bad in this case is simple to do - let us
let John work out the best way.
We must have lost a TSC sanity check somewhere along the way.  I wonder
what it was?

I wouldn't expect it to matter, unless the TSCs are running at different
speeds or something.
Also the sched-domain migration costs are grossly different between the two
kernels.  Maybe we changed the migration-cost-estimation code; I forget.
I'll see if we can get an expert opinion on the write_tsc() failure.
