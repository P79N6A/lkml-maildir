Wasn't this whole thread about making it possible?

Sure you have to punt out outside this spinlock and then find
a "safe place" as you put it to wait. The low level IOMMU code
would supply the wakeup.

It already has one (pci_map_sg returning 0 or pci_mapping_error()
for pci_map_single()) 
The problem is just that when you get it you can only error out
because there is no way to wait for a free space event. With
your help I've been trying to figure out how to add it. Of course
after that's done you still have to do the work to handle 
it in the block layer somewhere.

Probably, but one would need to be careful to not miss events this way.
