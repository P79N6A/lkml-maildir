Hi All,
When we say Linux is open source and we have the sites
where we can download the source from, why is not
linux design (High Level and Low Level) not that well
publicised? (Or is it that I am not aware of - in
which case I would like to know where it is.)
I am looking for a traceability matrix- where I start
with requirements of Linux, dig into the
design(HLD/LLD) and then the source.
Thanks for the help in advance..
