NO.
This is a BUG IN THE SCHEDULER!
We should notice automatically that X is "interactive", thanks to the 
fact that interactive tasks wait for it. That's the whole point of my very 
simple patch..
So don't argue about things that are obviously broken. Renicing X is not 
the answer, and in fact there have been multiple reports that it makes 
XMMS skip sound because it just _hides_ the problem and moves it 
elsewhere.
Please test my simple patch that should at least attack the real issue 
instead of waffling and hiding it.
