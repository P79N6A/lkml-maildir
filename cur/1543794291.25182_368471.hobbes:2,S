Simple answer? No. At least not meaningfully.
If you do:
cpu = fictitious_get_my_cpu();
if (cpu == last_cpu()) {
	rdtsc(oldtime);
	...
}
There's no guarantee that jack doesn't switch cpu's from when it found out
what CPU it was on to doing the calculation.  So it would be easier to pin
it.
(apt-get schedutils)
man 1 taskset
or if you modify the code:
mn 2 sched_setaffinity
