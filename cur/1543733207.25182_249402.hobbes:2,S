kernel oops in sch_ingress
when the network comes up, the whole achine locks up hard, making it
impossible to use the network and the machine.
networking, modules
version 2.6.8.1
the most i was abe to get from it was:
sig11 ing_hook+0x48/0x50 sch_ingress
and something about nf_iterate and nf_hook_slow
cat /proc/cpuinfo

the other stuff (/proc/modules, ver_linux script, etc.) is only relevant to the
FUBAR kernel, therefore i won't post it - only upon request, as it isn't always
convenient for me to reboot the machine to the FUBAR kernel (it serves as the
LAN's router as well).
i rebuilt the kernel something like 6 times or more thinking some config
changed and i was building it all wrong. guess not :)
thanks
