Please include a URL for the standard at the top of the LRW code and
next to the test vectors. I had to search around a fair bit for decent
background material, would be helpful to a couple other references as
well.

Your gfmulseq code has lots of StudlyCaps and strange whitespace, eg
this '{' should be on the next line.

The usage of your u128 type is really confusing, so 'u128' is an
especially bad name. I expect u128 to work like u64 and u32. I propose
gf128_t.

Have a very nice one of those already.

Better to use printk and put #define printk printf in your userspace
test harness.

Did I mention confusing?

Wrap this in a struct, please. That's disgusting.

LRW and the GF(2**128) code is not configurable?
