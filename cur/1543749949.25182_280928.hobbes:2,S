Clear_page is used both in the cache hot and no cache wanted case now.

Which two changes?
If an arch can do zeroing without touching the cpu caches then that can
be done with a zero driver.

Gang faulting is not part of this patch. Please keep the issues separate.

Again this is not related to this patchset. Look at the V13 of the page
fault scalability patch and you will find a /proc/sys/vm setting to
manipulate things. This is V2 of the prezeroing patch.

Umm. Yeah. I only have smallish i386 machines here. Maybe next year ;-)
