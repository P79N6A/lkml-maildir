  I really think this should be at  linux-net@vger.rutgers.edu, or
possibly even at the netdev@nuclecu.unam.mx (did I remember it right?).

	And pray tell, what does this "6% CPU" really mean ?
	BSD and Linux do account interrupt-side work differently.
	Unless the "Zero-copy" system really begins by supplying
	set of buffer descriptors that 1) are in userspace, and
	2) already are locked into memory, and 3) can be mapped
	into physical addresses for the network card DMA, I don't
	believe into this claimed zero-copy thing...
	I don't think the BPF does quite work that way.
	A true zero-copy would mean that the network card DMA engine
	is receiving data straight into user address space.  Easiest
	would there be dropping data into buffers within a SysV-SHM
	segment(s).
	Modern network cards can work with memory based descriptor lists
	quite fine.
	Now how to tell the user-space in most efficient manner, that new
	packet(s) have arrived ?  Busy poll is -- not so nice a thing...
	A SysV semaphore where the user-space process can wait for announ-
	cement(s) about interrupts ?  (And meanwhile the card can pull in
	more packets while the first has been announced to the userspace.)
	So, the network card driver and parts of the userspace must both
	be in tight co-operation to really get the full feed in, and no
	copying around in kernel space is to be allowed.  Trick-BFP, or
	not (preferrably not..)
	At work I might end up building something like this to monitor
	full-blast giga-ether flows, and possibly STM-1 or STM-4 ATM
	flow contained IP frames.
	Propably in form where the ethernets 6+6+2 prefix is stored into
	separate buffer (possibly same one for all packets), then IP's
	20 bytes plus some application bytes (TCP/UDP/whatnot), say 64
	in total into packet specific frames, and all the rest into common
	"junking" buffer of 8000+ bytes.
	(Ethernet MACs aren't interesting in between core routers.)
	Such will require some trick playing with the chained buffer
	descriptors, so be it :)   (We get aligned IPv4 frames with
	that trick even with e.g. Tulip cards.)
	NFR's requirements are likely different, like wanting full MAC
	frames.
