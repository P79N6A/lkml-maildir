The driver for my pci device, I have the SA_SHIRQ set.
Actually what I am thinking it may be APIC support problem. I rebuild my
kernel to use single cpu without APIC support, my device and 3c905 both
work fine. they don't work for SMP kernel (APIC is by default enabled)
Then I configured my uni-processor kernel to enable the APIC support, my
device won't work with the 3c905, just exactly same as it behaves in the
SMP kernel.
regards,
Alex
