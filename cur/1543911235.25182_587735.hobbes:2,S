I was having problem invoking the readahead logic on my compact flash
rootfs (ext3) with tweaking the RA with 'hdparm -a' from 8 to 1024
blocks and some benchmarks (I forget which).
Fengguang, what is your favourite benchmark for finding differences in
readahead values (running on eg ext3 on a flashdisk), with the current
RA semantics in mainline kernels (eg 2.6.23-rc3)?
Thanks,
  Daniel
