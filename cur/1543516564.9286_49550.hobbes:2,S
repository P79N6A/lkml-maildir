I don't think the SMP makes any difference.  I built a few systems over
the summer (K6-2 400s, 64MB RAM) that had some D-Link cards in them.  I
could reproduce this error pretty easily by ftp-ing the kernel source from
one machine to another.  This happened mainly (if not only) when both
machines were using a D-Link.  (Also only in Linux, not in Windows.)  One
of the machines was fine afterwards, but the other's interface went down.
This was consistently either the receiving or sending end, but I've
forgotten which.  I have the vague impression that this also was not a
problem with a 100Mbps connection, but this may be incorrect.  Sorry about
the vagueness, but this was several months ago and we've since replaced
the NICs.  I hope this gives a better idea of where to look though.
