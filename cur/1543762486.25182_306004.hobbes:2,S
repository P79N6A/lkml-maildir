in the SATA kconfig menu, the help message from  
Intel PIIX/ICH SATA support says:
 CONFIG_SCSI_ATA_PIIX:
This option enables support for ICH5 Serial ATA.
 If PATA support was enabled previously, this enables
 support for select Intel PIIX/ICH PATA host controllers.
anyone care to clarify if this mean that having enabled:
CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
i can use the PATA ports on a ICH5 controller through libata ?
if not, which is exactly the meaning of "If PATA support was enabled
previously" on this message ?
thanks.
