I was mainly speaking of e2fsck. You normally don't do mke2fs
automatically. But even then, yes, volume labels could sitll be used,
although their use would be far less common.

Why this should be a reason not to use them escapes me. At the moment its
practically impossible to use labels in your fstab just because e2fsck
doesn't support them.
Do _you_ want to tell me that 99% of the time, e2fsck does something else
than saying "filesystem clean"?
