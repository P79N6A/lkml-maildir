We want to be able to run the same kernel as pseries, e.g. on
distributions that ship only one kernel. Cell should be able to
live without CONFIG_NODES_SPAN_OTHER_NODES, but that does not solve
the problem for us.

Right, that was at least my intention, though I wasn't sure
if pseries can live without the check.
