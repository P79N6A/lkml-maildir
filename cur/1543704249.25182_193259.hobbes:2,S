 It seems to be P4-based -- I'm pretty sure the integrated APIC behaves
the same way regardless of where its plugged in, so why wouldn't this
problem appear earlier?  I've browsed my mailbox and found a patch that
was stated to fix problems on the system involved.  But the patch disables
the timer around certain actions -- that may indeed matter for some broken
firmware (especially some SMM crap), but I can't see how these bits could.
 That doesn't of course mean your patch shouldn't be applied -- it won't 
hurt to be overly careful.
