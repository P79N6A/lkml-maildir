You noticed too, hey :)
I've been collecting these reports for five or six weeks,
also getting things like .config, machine usage patterns,
machine history, etc.
It's like grabbing shadows, really.  A significant number
of the reporters are using netfilter, and that's basically
the only thing I have to go on at this time.  And a lot of
people use netfilter, so it's probably coincidental.
A number of the reports were confirmed to be against flakey
hardware.  A few more were on cranky old P150's and such,
which I'm tending to dismiss.  In fact the great majority
of reports are likely to be hardware failures.
But I don't recall seeing this volume of reports against
2.2.x.
And we have things like zeus.kernel.org's death yesterday.
Peter is quite certain that it was a software failure.
It certainly looks like random memory corruption.  Quite
frequently the faulting address is just "data".   Examples
from my growing vm-oopses folder include:
364d0a11
16a1842f
5f33f59b
410a0d26
d70f589b
6964656e
3562726b
0017e980
65726198
008209dc
Many more are null-pointer derefs.

Sure.  I can't think of any way of chasing this down (if it
exists) apart from putting special-purpose debug code into
the mainstream kernel.
Al suggests a `honey pot' kernel thread which ticks over,
allocating, validating and releasing memory, waiting for
it to get stomped on.   If it gets corrupted we can dump
lots of memory and a task list, I guess.
We could also re-enable slab debugging.
Also we can add some magic numbers to inodes and dentries,
validate addresses and memory locations as we walk the lists,
mainly on the shrink_cache path.  If corruption is detected
then we dump out lots of memory and look through it for
suspicious kernel addresses.
Any other ideas?
