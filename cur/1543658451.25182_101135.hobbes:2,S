Hi Alan,
I figured i wouldn't bother you until after New Year's. I'm having a brnad
new problem when playing mp3 with XMMS and changing songs work's until
i start to load other program's like LimeWire and Yahoo! Messenger. All
deal with  sound so i shut those off but i let XMMS keep playing
and then my audio from XMMS just shut's down and doesn't wanna play after that.
I don't know if i'm sending to many packets of audio to my sound card at
one time or if i'm just the lucky one with all the problems.
Nathaniel
