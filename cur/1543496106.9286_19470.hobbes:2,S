Subject: [SECURITY PATCH]: inconsistant checks in sys_ptrace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
In the arch/ section, sys_ptrace is inconsistant in its security checks.
Several archs miss the new cap_issubset check. Some other archs miss
various uid/gid checks.
This patch (untested, written by hand) fixes the security problems on
non-i386 archs.
Could you apply it please? Perhaps put it in 2.3.4 and if no compile
failures/objections result, 2.2.10 could probably do with it too.
Cheers
Chris
