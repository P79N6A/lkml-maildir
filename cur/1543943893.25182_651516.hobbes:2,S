btw., v2.6.25-rc1 is not affected by this. Gbpages support is a "still 
cooking" feature only available in x86.git#mm, destined for .26, and 
even there it's default disabled and only available on Barcelona class 
hardware. (Some of these bits are upstream already to make maintenance 
easier, but they are inactive code.)
