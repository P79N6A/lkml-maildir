Subject: [PATCH 06/11] uml ubd driver: ubd_io_lock usage fixup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Add some comments about requirements for ubd_io_lock and expand its use.
When an irq signals that the "controller" (i.e. another thread on the host,
which does the actual requests and is the only one blocked on I/O on the host)
has done some work, we call again the request function ourselves
(do_ubd_request).
We now do that with ubd_io_lock held - that's useful to protect against
concurrent calls to elv_next_request and so on.
XXX: Maybe we shouldn't call at all the request function. Input needed on this.
Are we supposed to plug and unplug the queue? That code "indirectly" does that
by setting a flag, called do_ubd, which makes the request function return (it's
a residual of 2.4 block layer interface).
Meanwhile, however, merge this patch, which improves things.
