Thats exactly my point, right now people tend to look at their
preferred architecture and say "thats what it does". Hence my request
for a decision and a small notice about it in the
documentation. Remember how many different oppinions we had on how
writel() behaves.

The case that Manfred brought up was perfectly valid - we could do
__raw_atomic_foo() functions to do it if there is a need. We could
also just decide that atomic_foo() does not guarantee ordering.
