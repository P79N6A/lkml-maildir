Looking through kernel/power/snapshot.c, I'd say this implementation has 
advantages in having support for memory hotplugging, sparseness and random 
access to the flags in the bitmap. Like the snapshot.c implementation, it 
uses per-zone bitmaps and has a method that can be used to iterate over the 
contents of a bitmap. Having per-node support might also be useful. I haven't 
looked at the speed of the snapshot.c implementation. Do you see advantages 
to snapshot.c that I might have missed?
Regards,
Nigel
