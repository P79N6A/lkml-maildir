I'm not sure what you are saying here. I've never hit the limit, even during
flood testing stuff, so I don't know what actually happens. Are you implying
that other Unixen reallocate an already used port, without the use of
SO_REUSEADDR, or that you think they should? I had always assumed, but never
explicitly read, that without SO_REUSEADDR there would never be reuse of the
local port.
One PITA with port allocation is that you can't reserve the darned things.
You are running a server. It dies. You try to restart it, and find some
client type program has just been allocated your port. Ugh!
