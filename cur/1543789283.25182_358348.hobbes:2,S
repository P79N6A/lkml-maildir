Looking at the sourcecode in rtl8169_down()
of drivers/net/r8169.c and the comparable code in
sis190_down() of drivers/net/sis190_down()
supports removing that comment as you suggest here.
I'd used this comparison to resolve an RCU question,
so I'm not the person to address this.
Thank you for the clarification.
