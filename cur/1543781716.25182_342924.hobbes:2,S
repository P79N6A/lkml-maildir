Hi, I have a debugging module that I want to register a die notifier.
But I just noticed that I can't unregister it.  So for now I either just
keep the module loaded and never unloaded it, compile it into the
kernel, or ifdef out the register_die_notifier when loaded as a module.
Is there some reason that there isn't such a call, or maybe there is,
and I don't see it (called something else). Or is this something that
should be added?
Thanks,
-- Steve
