No luck here, Jeff ... if the hardware is really based on AMD8111 as it 
appears to be (i2c and ide are similar), they surelly changed more registers. 
It'll take some time to RE it.
And I don't know how important is this information, but it doesn't get the 
iobase addr either and it can't be manually set in ifconfig.
