No, the "kicking" should _not_ be automatic.
Th ewhol epoint of a lot of the task queues is that they are manual. The
main use for them (apart from the tty layer, which could easily use
something else) is the disk starter - where we want to delay the
submission of requests to the disk until we've aggregated as many as
possible. Which means that the "tq_disk" queue must absolutely not be
kicked automatically.
