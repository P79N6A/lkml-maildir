Got this warning on 32-bit ppc, seems real? And it seems I2O 
subsystem has no maintainer (only DPT_I2O has one)?
  CC [M]  drivers/message/i2o/i2o_block.o
drivers/message/i2o/i2o_block.c: In function 'i2o_block_transfer':
drivers/message/i2o/i2o_block.c:837: warning: integer overflow in expression
The line in question is
msg->u.head[1] = cpu_to_le32(I2O_CMD_PRIVATE << 24 | HOST_TID << 12 | tid);
and I2O_CMD_PRIVATE is defined as 0xFF. This gets "0xFF0100 | tid" and 
fits into 32-bit unsigned but not into 32-bit signed integer properly.
Target value head[*] is defined as u32 so the claculation does not fit 
during computation? Should we mark the shiftable inputas as unsigned?
