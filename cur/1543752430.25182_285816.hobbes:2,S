The current Gadugi implementation has compiled the Linux kernel as a 
standalone elf64 module that loads as
an application on the Gadugi kernel, with the /arch portions stripped 
and mapped into Gadugi.  Gadugi has it's
own elf64 loader (non-GPL). The GPL language states that the "collective 
work" definition refers to code sections
which constitute part of a "whole" unpo which the "separate" work in based.
This is a collective work which is "not based upon Linux", Linux runs as 
a kernel app.  Provided the two
code bases remain separate, there are no GPL issues with the current 
language.  Gadugi is a separate
elf64 module with it's own loader, services, etc.  The fact that Linux 
is now "based on" another operating
system reverses the license language (thanks Richard S. for inserting 
this) and the GPL also states
that independent works are "separate" and not affected by this license. 
I realize there may be many people who take issue with this, but this is 
the laguage, and yes, GPL code can be taken and
used this way.  The two code bases are maintained seprately and not 
compiled together.  But Linux can be loaded
as as Elf application, and in this sense it is a "seperate" work and 
whole in itself.
