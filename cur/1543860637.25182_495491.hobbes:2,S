This is definitly wrong.  This is a header file for a specific driver.
I suspect you want the old-EH definitions for SCSI_RESET_*/SCSI_ABORT_*?
You're returning them from the EH routines which are plugged into the
new EH method slots, so this is not only wrong by including an other
drivers private headers but also functionally deadly.
