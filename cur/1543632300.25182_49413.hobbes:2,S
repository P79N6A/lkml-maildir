Yes it could result in false sharing. You could probably avoid
that by imposing classes of allocation - say STRICLY_LOCAL and
ALMOST_LOCAL, so that strictly local objects are not penalized
by occasionally non-local objects. If your code frequently accesses 
other CPU's copy of the object than you should not be using this 
per-cpu allocator in the first place, it would be meaningless.

You can use SGI kernprof to measure PMCs. See the SGI oss
website for details. You can count L2_LINES_IN event to
get a measure of cache line bouncing.
