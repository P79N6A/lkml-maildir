Lets see - that zone will have no free nor inactive pages 
In page_alloc.c:254  function __alloc_pages_limit
where water_mark will be zero too...
              if (z->free_pages + z->inactive_clean_pages >= water_mark) {    
we will attempt a lot of interesting/unnecessary stuff.
But it should be caught by the test a few lines up...
                if (!z->size)
                        BUG();
In page_alloc.c:331 (function __alloc_pages)
                if (z->free_pages >= z->pages_low) {
                        page = rmqueue(z, order);
                        if (page)
                                return page;
Hmm... a lot more than first meets the eye.
Note: >= matches < in another place, removing the = will leave the mm stuck...
