Hi,
Here's a tiny patch making a few esthetic changes to 
Documentation/laptop-mode.txt
To me this patch makes sense, but feel free to disagree, I don't feel 
strongly about it at all.
It changes a single URL to its strictly correct form (directories should 
end in /), and it makes the arguments to main in an included example 
program follow convention and be named argc and argv.
