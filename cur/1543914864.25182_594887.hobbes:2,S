I have been toying with the idea of having seperate caches for pinned
and movable dentries.  Downside of such a patch would be the number of
memcpy() operations when moving dentries from one cache to the other.
Upside is that a fair amount of slab cache can be made movable.
memcpy() is still faster than reading an object from disk.
Most likely the current reaction to such a patch would be to shoot it
down due to overhead, so I didn't pursue it.  All I have is an old patch
to seperate never-cached from possibly-cached dentries.  It will
increase the odds of freeing a slab, but provide no guarantee.
But the point here is: dentries/inodes can be made movable if there are
clear advantages to it.  Maybe they should?
