I have no idea what you're doing.

See Documentation/sysfs-rules.txt.

That was a _suggestion_.

If you use bash scripts as examples, people will write bash scripts.

"change" - something about the device has changed
"move" - the device is in a different position in the tree now
You may want to grep for the usage...

The problem is that your information is wrong. Imagine someone reading
this document, thinking "cool, I'll create a char node if
SUBSYSTEM!=block" and subsequently getting completely confused about
all those SUBSYSTEM==pci events.

The code disagrees with you. If a driver matches and probing succeeds,
it will be specified, otherwise not. Maybe you were checking the wrong
devices?

It _does_ specify what you may rely on. Don't rely on anything else.

And that is exactly what sysfs-rules.txt is doing. I don't understand
your problem.
If you think that getting this information from sysfs-rules.txt could
be made easier, do a patch against it.
