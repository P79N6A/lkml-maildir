I forgot to mention the kind of UART in my mail but it is a 16650A (and
configured as such and detected as such) and I have overruns nevertheless.
bash-2.05a# cat /proc/tty/driver/serial
serinfo:1.0 driver revision:
0: uart:16550A port:000003F8 irq:4 tx:31 rx:7 RTS|CTS|DTR|DSR
1: uart:16550A port:000002F8 irq:3 tx:24 rx:7 RTS|CTS|DTR|DSR
(here there's no overrun but I almost didn't use the serial port since
last reboot)
Cheers,
