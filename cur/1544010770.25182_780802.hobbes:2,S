Better than nothing, I guess.
We may end up back-porting it (since Chen confirms that it's not just a 
warning, it actually affects functionality), but let's get it some testing 
in -next first and then eventually in the merge window. So you might mark 
it for attention for 'stable@kernel.org' as you commit it.
