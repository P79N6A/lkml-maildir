What's the current status of linux-aio?
Is there any working example using linux-aio?
Is linux-aio going to support sockets?
Are there more linux sleeping (or blocking) API calls going to be ported to linux-aio?
Is there an official home page of linux-aio apart from the outdated:
http://www.kvack.org/~blah/aio/
 ?
