Actually this is 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10117
 ... and what you
describe is exactly what I was seeing. 
However I thought that we are talking about the hang with 
ladder governor as the last message on the screen. Anyway I am not sure
if both bugs are related or not but I couldn't reproduce the throttling
states bug with current mainstream...
