Only module_param_array() sets a number: the number of elements in the
array.  By making that arg a pointer, we can put "NULL" there, since it
turned out many people didn't care how many elements there were (and
were overloading the same variable for all their arrays, which breaks
printing in sysfs).
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
