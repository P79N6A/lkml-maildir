they are, and those workloads aren't anonymous memory intensive that's
why the difference is not significant (see the benchmark I posted a few
days ago comparing anon_vma with mainline, the boost is huge on a 1G
box, on a 64bit multi-gigabox the boost will be even bigger, close to
100% speedup infact).

pgd_alloc is the fork path, so yes it's a very good tradeoff (really I
didn't check if any memory is being wasted by the bigger allocations,
but that is solvable even without the slab and without page->list by
just chaining the pages like poll does).
However Wli suggested that we shouldn't stop using the slab for those
minuscle allocations, and that the slab should not use the lists
instead. You may want to ask Wli for details. For now I enjoy the
36bytes page_t ;)

I giveup counting, I used the compiler this time, and yes it's 32bytes
for every page_t of 2.6-aa compared to 48bytes of 2.4.
