Is it really a problem ? Simply raise the bios temperature limit and it's
OK. My dual XP is between 65 and 75 degrees idle, and goes up to 93 during
intensive compilations, and it's doing very well. Admittedly, you have to
wait a *very* long time after power down to touch the heatsinks, but I don't
need to do that anyway, and I prefer the sound of silence ;-)
Cheers,
