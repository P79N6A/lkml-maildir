I've done some work on xclip in Debian so I thought to test it. It 
doesn't happen to me on my Debian testing with xclip 0.08-4
After 4k of transfers the clipboard protocol means sending multiple 
messages, I've did some fixes in that area a while ago and didn't hear 
of any problems in that area.
I'd be happy to hear of such problems, directly or in the Debian BTS.
