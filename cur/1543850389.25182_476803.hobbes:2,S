this ugly quoting would be prevented if you used a line length of 72.

No so simple: I mildly overclocked my FSB, from 2400 to 2520 MHz and I

analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: powernow-k8
  CPUs which need to switch frequency at the same time: 0 1
  hardware limits: 1000 MHz - 2.40 GHz
  available frequency steps: 2.40 GHz, 2.20 GHz, 2.00 GHz, 1.80 GHz, 1000 MHz
  available cpufreq governors: ondemand, powersave, performance
  current policy: frequency should be within 1000 MHz and 2.40 GHz.
                  The governor "ondemand" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 1000 MHz.
analyzing CPU 1:
[the same]
from demsg:
time.c: Detected 2520.575 MHz processor.
Which means that my X2 4600+ works just fine, but after overclocking
cpufreq restores it to the FSB that it should run on.
If you care about that changed, try to find out what patch caused this,
but in general, there's no support for overclocking in the kernel, and
bugreports from overclocked systems are frowned upon.
Kind regards,
