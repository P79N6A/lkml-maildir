Sorry, I misread the post.  He tried this.
I was under the impression this was due to inconsistent implementation
of autonegotiation in hardware.  When I was an ISP sysadmin we had this
problem with various devices (Cisco switches, Linux and BSD/OS
machines).  A device would get power cycled and one side would come up
100/full, the other 100/half.   We ended up hard setting everything.
