the compilation such that it doesn't take up any resources on systems that
don't need it.
This set of patches is against the block git tree.
Changes in [try #6]:
 (*) Remove all traces of block_sync_page() from AFS.
Changes in [try #5]:

 (*) Remove dependencies on BLOCK where there are also dependencies on SCSI.
