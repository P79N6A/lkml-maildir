There are a set of patents involved for the hardware but when you buy
the chipsets you normally buy the chipsets and all the attached rights
to use, just like when you buy a pentium IV you don't then go and get a
set of patent licenses from amd, intel. ibm and so on.
To sell the product you then also need to meet FCC and/or CE mark
testing as appropriate for your target market. Typically thats upwards
of $10K
