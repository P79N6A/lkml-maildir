	   This whole stupid 'kgcc' thing is yet another in a long
   line of really dumb things that RedHat has done and it's just
   another reason i'm glad i switched from RedHat to Debian.
Please get your facts straight.
The rest of this thread will show you that this is not a "Red Hat
thing".  Connectiva, Mandrake, and others do the same thing.  In fact
we choose the name "kgcc" to match the convention set by these other
distributions.
