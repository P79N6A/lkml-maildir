Competition will come up with the same situation like reiserfs and ext3
and XFS, namely that they'll all be maintained going forward because of,
uhm, political constraints ;-)
But then, as long as they _are_ maintained and play along nicely with
eachother (which, btw, is needed already so that at least data can be
migrated...), I don't really see a problem of having two or three.
