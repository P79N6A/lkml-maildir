There's not much point dual licensing with BSD and GPL.  It's equivalent
to the BSD license alone, so why be confusing about it?
Dual licensing makes sense when the two licenses are otherwise
incompatible.  E.g. GPL and MPL.  Technically, neither of those licenses
permits most people to redistribute the resulting work under a dual
license.  So ongoing work on that kind of dual licensed work is arguably
not permitted at all, unless you go through the original authors.
ObKernel: the pcmcia subsystem is dual licensed under GPL and MPL.
