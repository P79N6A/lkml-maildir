That is actually what the kernel does internally, too. It does not keep 
the size of the symbol, but tries to guess it from the address of the 
next non-aliased symbol.
Since the addresses are sorted, this works fine most of the time. This 
is done to reduce the size used by the symbol table in the running kernel.
Just take a look at "get_symbol_pos" in kernel/kallsyms.c and 
"get_ksymbol" in kernel/module.c to see exactly how this is done
