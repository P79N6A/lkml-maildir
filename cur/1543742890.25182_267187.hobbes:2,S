/proc/sys/kernel/panic has been around for YEARS:
  [cramer:ttyp0]dominion:~/[10:52am]:uname -a
  Linux dominion 2.3.42-SMP #11 SMP Sun Feb 6 20:06:02 EST 2000 i686
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ****
  [cramer:ttyp0]dominion:~/[10:52am]:ls -l /proc/sys/kernel/panic
  -rw-r--r--   1 root     root            0 Nov  1 10:52 /proc/sys/kernel/panic
And that's the oldest kernel I happen to have running at the moment.
