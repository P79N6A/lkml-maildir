Hi ...
Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here goes, is there
anywhere in the Vast knowledge of this kernel list
anyone that knows of (LAT= local area transfer)Vax  or DECServer compatible
services that will allow VTerminals (vt320 type) usable in Linux ?.
i think that the terminals just login and get services from the _Main_ VMS
server like Wordperfect(terminal mode)
i would like to replace the existing  _old_  Vax to use a more robust DEC
Alpha64 with Linux but i still need to provide
terminal services for the 50 + terminals ...   any clues or ???    Rob F.
