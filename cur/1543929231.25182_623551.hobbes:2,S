For all I care binary modules can break, but frankly I don't see
how encapsulating a couple of structures and pointers in a new
structure and adding a new argument to existing functions shifts
the decision about how a function should be usable to the namespace
guys. IMO all functions should continue to be usable as before,
as decided by whoever actually wrote them. The only exception
might be stuff where an existing EXPORT_SYMBOL is clearly wrong,
but that would be a seperate discussion.
