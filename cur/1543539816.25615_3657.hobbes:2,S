ok, thanks to all who have replied. Now my raid array works well again.
I just had to do "mkraid -f /dev/md1" on it to force to reconstruct the
superblocks. All disks are currently being rescanned for eventual defects,
but everything seems clean. The reconstruction ended with no errors. I won't
have to restore ;-)
thanks again,
Willy
