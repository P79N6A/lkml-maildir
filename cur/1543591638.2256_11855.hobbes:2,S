Somebody, run to database vendors and tell them that they were selling
snake oil all that time - Richard had just shown that support of remote
transactions is impossible. Can't do that with read() and write(),
dontcha know?
Richard, I hate to break it on you, but
	fd = open(foo, 2);
		/* kernel creates a new struct file, as usual */
	write(fd, data, len);
		/* kernel starts the operation */
	read(fd, reply, size);
		/* we block */
		/* operation is completed */
		/* kernel passes reply to user and wakes it up */
_is_ a support of transactions. And yes, we can trivially distinguish
between requests from different sources - struct file * passed to
->write() is more than enough for that. Moreover, we can easily block
other writers until the action is completed.
Please, get a bloody clue. There are reasons for and against ioctls, but
need to send data and wait for responce is _NOT_ one of them.
