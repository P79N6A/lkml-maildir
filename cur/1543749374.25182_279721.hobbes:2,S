IMHO reducing the number of files to modify should be done
first before attempting a mainline merge. That is how a lot
of other more intrusive changes have been merged in the past.
There was a intensive review process and eventually the interfaces
were cleaned up a lot of and the thing was merged piece by piece
after considerable changes.

Even without boot time switch but only CONFIG switch 
a more shared code base would be probably the only saner
way long time. I'm not sure a run time switch is really
that good an idea, it would essentially require to run
most of pgtable.h etc. through function pointers and 
I don't like this idea very much. But at least doing the
reorganization on the source code level would probably
clean up the interface considerably.

Perhaps for now, but eventually this will not work anymore due
to inevitable code drift (I went exactly through the same phase for a year
or so on x86-64. These days I have to redo most patches unless
i'm lucky enough that the contributor does both) 
And with also supporting x86-64 it will not really work this
way well because you would need to merge from two sources. 
I can't see any mechanical scheme handling that.
The only sane way to maintain the merging scheme you proposed
would be then arch/xen64, multiplying work again.
