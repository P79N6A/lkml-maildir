IOW, there is *no chance* to get a white-hat patent on anything I've
described on these lists recently.  That doesn't bother me a lot since
there is still a lot I haven't described.  What should I do, put it all
in the totally-public domain and let evildoers have it too, or should I
do interim patent applications from now on?
