The kernel isnt there to fix up the fact authors can't read. Its also very
hard to get emulations right. I grant that this wasn't helped by the fact
the gcc x86 folks also couldnt read the pentium pro manual correctly.
If you have a static linked program install the right version. RPMv4
even knows about cmov and i686 rpms.
