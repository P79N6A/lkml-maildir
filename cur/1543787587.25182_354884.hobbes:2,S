Problem, I have a number of dual processor Opterons that do not work 
with pci expansion chassis'. The reason that they do not work is because 
none of the cards discovered in the chassis get the pci bus master bit 
set in their command register. If I manually set this bit in our cards 
everything is fine. When we connect the same chassis to an Intel P4 box 
everything is fine. It looks like it is the kernel that sets this bit 
because we have never set it in any of our drivers, yet on the intel 
boxes it gets set. Why would this bit not be set when the chassis is 
connected to an Opteron. We are running 32-bit mode BTW. I am using a 
2.6.11.9 kernel. Is this a motherboard problem or could this be a kernel 
problem?
Thanks
Mark
