  Junk ?   That is PPP protocol being spoken on the line, although
most of the "control" characters sent over there you won't see (and
thus have incorrectly pasted them).
If you want to have a normal text-login, there needs to be e.g. a 'getty'
program at that serial line.  Now you have something else.
(There are several different programs that behave like the original
 'getty', usually their name contains 'getty' string.)
Reading more of PPP FAQs and HOWTOs will tell you what you will need to
setup at the serial ports of both machines.   In essence you setup
network connection between the machines, then you use some network
protocol to communicate in between the machines.  NOT serial terminal!
