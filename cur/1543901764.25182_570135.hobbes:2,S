MSI was off for the test:
  # CONFIG_PCI_MSI is not set
full config is at:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/config
the hang-log is at:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/hang.log
netconsole output went silent during the last tx-timeout message. (the 
above hang.log is from dmesg)

there's a real and deterministic path towards fixing the patch. The 
regression is obvious and triggers all the time.
