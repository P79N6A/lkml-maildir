I haven't been able to get pppd to work with any of the 2.6.0 kernels even
though it works with the same setup under my 2.5.75 kernel.  I'm getting
the error
  pppd[1336]: pppd 2.4.1 started by mharrell, uid 1000
  chat[1350]: Can't get terminal parameters: No such device
  pppd[1336]: Connect script failed
  pppd[1336]: tcsetattr: No such device
The device does exist, though, and I can access it fine through minicom.  I've
tried it with both devfs turned on and off and it doesn't seem to make a 
difference.  I'm not getting any unusual messages in the kernel log
  CSLIP: code copyright 1989 Regents of the University of California
  PPP generic driver version 2.4.2
Any idea what's going on?  Since the config is rather long I just put it
online here
