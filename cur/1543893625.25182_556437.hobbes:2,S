Yeah.. seems to be so. But let's consider whether these 'inactive ticks' are
really inactive [1] :
The fact that user's tasks are not active at the moment of a timer
interrupt doesn't mean
they were not active _during_ the last tick. That's why another
approach in update_load_fair() which doesn't depend on a snapshot of
rq->raw_weighted_load
at timer tick's time. I guess, we'd lose this with 'inactive ticks',
right? ok, maybe
it's not that important for per-user cpu_load, duno at the moment.

At least, we are getting some inaccuracy (not in a generic case
though) due to the
        if (exec_delta64 > (u64)TICK_NSEC)
                exec_delta64 = (u64)TICK_NSEC;   [*]
in update_load_fair().. and that's smth I want to try changing...

With the current code, yes - it may be. In case, [*] condition (see
above) comes into play (and these 'inactive' ticks were not really
inactive as described above).

I think, you are right.

I'll take a look (e.g. I guess, we have got a notion of "user's
weght"... so does/how a user's weight contribute to his tasks weight..
otherwise, I think, the approach of determining
the busiest CPU based only on pure tasks' weight would be wrong.. will
look at it first).

yeahh.. have to think about it.
btw, I recall the patch #4 adds some light but noticeable overhead,
right? did you look at where exactly the overhead comes from?

I guess, it's not only about CFS but about the users' behavior, which
is something
we can't control and so can't rely on it.
Say, a user was active till the moment T1 and then just gone.. - all
his tasks are really inactive.
So at the moment T2 user's Irq :: cpu_load will still express the
situation at the moment T1?
As long as user's lrq is not involved in 'load balancing', this
inaccuracy can be revealed only if the info is exported via /proc.
But say, user's task becomes finally active after _a lot_ of inactive
ticks (the user came back).. now it's in the rq and waiting for its
turn (which can be easily > 1 tick).. in the mean time 'load
balancing' is triggered.. and it considers the old lrq :: cpu_load[]
...
P.S.
just a personal impression.. I'm quite confused by this 'lrq' name...
it looks pretty similar to 'Irq' (with a big 'i') and I can't stop
reading it as 'IRQ'  [ chores: so stop it! ]
would be smth like 'cfs_rq' or even 'sched_rq' better? :-)
