YES! When you have resource management such a situation is quite common.
As I wrote in antoher email example:
VPS has reached it's process limit and you can't enter it.
If you suggest to make enter without resource limitations, then it will 
be a security hole.

uff... we can start calling ptrace etc. via proc then :)
UGLY! I think Linus will ban us for such ideas. And he will be right.
