That's a different style of profiling.  There is a fellow
working on that (see 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fnccheck
 )
but there's value in the gprof-style of profiling as well.
(For instance, I suspect it's lower overhead.)
I think it's reasonable for us to get gprof working; it's
a useful part of classic Unix, and the fix looks easy.
Ulrich, do you at least agree that it would be desirable for
gprof to work properly on multithreaded programs?
