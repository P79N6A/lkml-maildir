OK, updated patchset in the same place:
	ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/people/viro/patchset/
	ftp.linux.org.uk:/pub/people/viro/patch-2.6.13-git5-bird1.bz2
Old splitup had been moved to patchset-RC13-git3.
Changes:
	* F6-zatm and B40-mxser-sparc32 merged upstream
	* jd1--jd9 are partially merged, partially dropped - when Jeff posts
new set, it will get it.
	* UM1-segv-stubs reduced to one chunk - that got missed in the
upstream merge
	* UM2-signal merged upstream
	* T4-m68k-flags updated due to m68k ptrace.c indent patch upstream.
Added:
	* B43-serial	gratitious includes of asm/serial.h in drivers/char
	* B44-genrtc	genrtc is not for sparc64
	* C38-ppc44x-pm	missed s/u32/pm_message_t/ in arch/ppc/syslib/ocp.c
	* C39-s390	temporary fix for s390 mismerge
