I think I already mentioned what the stack trace is for this oops:
for me, it is sd_detach -> driverfs_remove_partitions ->
put_device -> driverfs_remove_dir -> driverfs_rmdir -> d_unhash.
I have seen lots of other oopses related to driverfs.
Submitted a stopgap patch to prevent some of them, but withdrew it
when it became clear that even the ugly stopgap did not prevent all.
This driverfs partition stuff is messy. The code paths where partitions
are created are very different from those where partitions are removed,
and it can easily happen that a partition is removed that was never
created, leading to an oops.
