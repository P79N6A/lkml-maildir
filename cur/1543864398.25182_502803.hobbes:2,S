I think no, please see below. Actually, this is more related to timers for
this particular case.

The slab has a notification: CPU_XXX events. It should cancel a pending per
cpu "reap_work timer".

But this is practically impossible to avoid. We can't delay CPU_DOWN until all
workqueues flush their cwq->worklist. This is livelockable, the work can re-queue
itself, and new works can be added since the dying CPU is still on cpu_online_map.
This means that some pending works will be processed on another CPU.
delayed_work is even worse, the timer can migrate as well.
The first problem (smp_processor_id() is not stable) could be solved if we
use freezer or with the help of not-yet-implemented scalable lock_cpu_hotplug.

Yes.
