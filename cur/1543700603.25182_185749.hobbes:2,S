Pristine - hell no. None of my install are pristine :).
Bind - hell no. I may be^W^Wam stupid, but does *anyone* put boxes in
production without disabling services first?

Uh, it may be rooted allright, but I seriously doubt that is cause of this
symptom.

I know that, but I'm not exactly lacking interesting admin things to do so
that I would run around upgrading all the boxes there are lying around on
the corners each time a distro upgrade comes up. The box works for what it
is supposed to do (a miracle, that, considering it's a 200MHz/64MB
screamer), it's behind a fw, most services are disabled. And it's actually
being phased out of production anyway.
Sure, if I had endlessly time on my hands, I'd upgrade the distro, but right
now, I'll have to settle with just keeping the crucial services up-to-date.

No problem with getting good uptimes with this kernel (2.4.21-jam1). I only
had to boot it to install the do_brk patch.

Longest uptimes I've got are with 2.0 and 2.2 so far. And I have a number of
RH 6.2 distros running still. I see no fundamental problem with an old
distro (as long as you know the down sides (keep the services up-to-date, no
>2GB file support with all applications etc etc).
