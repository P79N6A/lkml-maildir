Personally, I don't feel a strong requirement that it be open source, 
because I don't believe it violates the intent of the GPL license by 
crippling free distribution of the kernel, requiring some fee for use, 
or doing anything unethical.  There have been charges that the VMI layer 
is deliberately designed as a GPL circumvention device, which I want to 
stamp out now before we try to get any code for integrating to it 
upstreamed.

I think saying require at this point is a bit preliminary for us -- I'm 
trying to prove we're not being evil and subverting the GPL, but I'm 
also not guaranteeing yet that we can open-source the code under a 
specific license.  Sorry about having to doublespeak here - but we have 
not yet got a green light to open source the VMI layer under the GPL.  
Perhaps there are some other issues I haven't conceived of.  We still 
have some source separation issues with creating a build environment due 
to entangled header files - that is being sorted out, but we're 
certainly not ready to distribute an open source buildable VMI layer for 
ESX today.  I sincerely hope we will be very soon.

Unfortunately, inlining and patching code will break CFI debug 
information!  I haven't thought of a way to fix this yet other than 
using frame pointers.  At least the possibility of debugging exists.
