That's actually fairly normal.  A break condition is by definition
a framing error, and possibly a parity error as well.  Also, a break
condition is not an error per-se.
Also, if you do add in the associated framing or parity errors, you're
likely to get different results from different hardware - some hardware
mask off the framing and parity errors when detecting a break condition.
Others don't.

Does look racy if "scc" is shared between several ports.  The locking
here is only per-port, so this is racy.
