The problem of you have an incorrect device tree what do you do yes.
The difference that I see is in how the tree gets wrong, and what
parts of it you want to keep.

The solution I keep am thinking of is to simply push an IORESOURCE_TENTATIVE
thing out of the way.
What I am thinking is that /proc/iomem would start out looking link:
fec00000-fec08fff : reserved
ffe80000-ffffffff : reserved
And end up looking like:
fec00000-fec00fff : reserved
fec01000-fec013ff : 0000:00:0f.0
fec01400-fec08fff : reserved
ffe80000-ffffffff : reserved
And either put the code to do that in request_resource, or have
a demand_resource thing that does it.  The only thing worth preserving
in the mixed up BIOS case is that find_resource does not allocate that
range for something else.
