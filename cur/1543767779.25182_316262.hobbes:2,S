Actually, it's completely unnecessary.  iscsi_uevent contains a uint64_t
element, and the GCC docs (in the 'Type attribute' section, documenting
aligned) say:
     Note that the alignment of any given `struct' or `union' type is
     required by the ISO C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of
     the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members
     of the `struct' or `union' in question.  This means that you _can_
So best to just delete it.  It has no effect.

This one's probably useless too, but it's hard to tell since the patches
weren't sent inline thus making them difficult to cross-reference.

he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
