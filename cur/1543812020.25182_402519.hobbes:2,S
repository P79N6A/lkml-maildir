I think Konrad was on top of it, mostly just confusion over variants
of the same diff leading to things previously fixed being dropped again.
In light of Matthew's comments in this thread though, I'm also wondering
if we can now get by without this diff, and just enable it by default now
that the kernel respects that the BIOS and leaves it alone if it's been
disabled.
