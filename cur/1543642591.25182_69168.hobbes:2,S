Are you sure that it is not just the drive mis-reporting the start/stop counts?  S.M.A.R.T. implementions are often flakey.

I have *never* lost data to a Maxtor disk.  I have had IBM, Fujitsu, Western Digital, and DEC drives all fail on me before.
It's dissapointing that Maxtor are reducing their warranty from 3 years to 1 year, but on the other hand, I've never needed it at all.
