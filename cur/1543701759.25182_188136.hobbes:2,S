A Happy New Year !
We are glad to announce the USAGI STABLE RELEASE 5, dated on January 4th, 2004.
This is the last major STABLE release based on linux-2.4 kernel from USAGI
Project. Our primary target of development is moved to linux-2.6 kernel.
Changes from the STABLE RELEASE 4.1 are:
 * based on linux-2.4.21,
 * IPsec transport/tunnel mode support,
 * Mobile IPv6 support,
 * fixed interaction between IPsec and Mobile IPv6,
 * Default Router Preference Support, and
 * Route Information Option Support.
However, the IPsec and Mobile IPv6 implementations included in this STABLE
release may not developed further. Because the IPsec stack was written for
linux-2.4 kernel by USAGI Project and currently we have rewritten NEW IPsec
stack for linux-2.6 kernel and the stack is included linux-2.6 mainline kernel.
The IPsec stack included linux-2.6 kernel is implemented based on "xfrm"
architecture and we will continue developing based on the NEW IPsec stack.
The Mobile IPv6 stack is the same situation as the IPsec. The Mobile IPv6 stack
included in this release is developed by HUT GO Project and the stack is mainly
written for linux-2.4 kernel. Currently USAGI Project and GO Project have
started joint project for developing new Mobile IPv6 stack based on linux-2.6
kernel.
You can get our complete kit which includes kernel tree, library and
applications from <

 .
We also provide separate patches against the main-line kernel and the tools
<
ftp://ftp.linux-ipv6.org/pub/usagi/stable/split/>
 .
Many of our efforts are already in mainline kernel tree. We will continue
making reasonable size patches and trying to merge it into mainline kernel
tree.
We announce the latest information on our web pages. Please check our web site
