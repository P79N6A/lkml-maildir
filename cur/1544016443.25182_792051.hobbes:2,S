Hi Jaswinder.
I appreciate your work but I will like to question the approach.
We should rather take the warnings as an indication that this
file needs to be looked over and fix not only the warnings
reported but rater to fix all the questionable issues on a file-by-file basis.
If the patch gets involved then it should be split in two.
Could I ask you to at least consider this approach.
Thanks,
	Sam
