Yes, I agree, almost anything is more sane than code I posted :-(. My
only requirement is that it works with radeonfb and similar low-level
drivers (so that I can get suspend-to-ram to work) and that it gets
past our branding people...

How many distros do use some variant of bootsplash? SuSE does, from
above url I guess gentoo does, too... Does RedHat do something
similar? [Or do they just set log-level to very high giving them clean
look?] What about Debian?
If most distros do some kind of splash screen, anyway, it would make
sense to merge one "good" version...
