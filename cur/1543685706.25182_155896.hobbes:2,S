I can boot a Athlon based PC with a Matrox-G450. It runs well.
The frame buffer is broken, and so is X and overlay buffer,
but it doesn't crash at all.
I also booted another kernel on the VGA console.
The console is OK, X and overlay buffer are still broken,
but the machine euns well.
I have two 2.6.0-test2, one with the matroxfb,
the other one just with the VGA console.

I will check this, I'd like to have more than a VGA console :-)
