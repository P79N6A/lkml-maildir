You don't need a migration tool.
All you need is:
1) a kernel level driver that can map devices, ie. a device mapper
2) user space tools that can parse the volume metadata and tell the
   kernel how to map each chunk at initialisation or mount time
You don't need a flying circus in kernel space.

Rik
