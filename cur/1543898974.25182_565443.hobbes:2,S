No.  int __user *v is pointer to noderef,address_space(1) int.  Same
as int const *v is pointer to const int.  Noderef is a property of
object being pointed to, _not_ the pointer itself.
And yes, I know that we store it ->modifiers of SYM_PTR - that saves us
a SYM_NODE we'd have to insert otherwise.  Same as with the rest of
qualifiers.
The same goes for address_space.  The same goes for const and volatile.
If you have struct foo {int x;}; struct foo __user *p; then &p->x will
be &((*p).x), i.e. &(<__user struct foo>.x), i.e. &(<__user int>), i.e.
int __user *.  __user is not a property of pointer; it couldn't work if
it would be.
