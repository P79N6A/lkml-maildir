One caviate just found ... HPT372 is not ultra 133 friendly.
At least the 1103:0004 rev5 which is the 366 device id.
Currently the HPT37/HPT374 do not like Ultra133.
So patch number 6 will come soon.
Export the error handling to the local personality drivers as proper.
Will now begin adding in the MMIO trasition HOST interface for the future
MMIO/ADMA/VirtualDMA (future is now) support of these devices.
It will generate its own nasty bug reports that will begin to expose the
lack of error recovery paths back to the top layer FS.  
Fix the error recovery to be handled local in the driver and then permit
the goal of partial completions w/ fast/safe path IO's.
Final add in TCQ that has been on hold since 2.3.99-pre6, but requires a
working clean taskfile data-phase handler set to work proper.  The
soft-driver junk will be added after adding the golden jewels of hardware
driven TCQ so using any drive with the new ATA-Bridge support to be
announced later will do it clean.  This is hardware PCI-ATA card is a TOE
for TCQ.
