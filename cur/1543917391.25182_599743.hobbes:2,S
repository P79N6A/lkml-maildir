You must not have been watching me SPAM netdev for the past two

It is queued for 2.6.24.  I'm not even sure it was originally posted
in time for the 2.6.23 merge window, but even if it was there was
a lot of opposition to merging it until fairly recently.  In fact,
I'm sure there are still some wireless developers that are less than
happy about merging it now.
Anyway, coming soon to a kernel near you...
