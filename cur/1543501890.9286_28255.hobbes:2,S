In /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Configure.help some of the options have
information on just how larger in size the kernel will be if the option is
compiled into the kernel, this leads me to belive it could be possable to
allow such a script to check the kernel size before compiling, or allowing
the script to actualy choose which option is needed. One problem here would
be that a list of sizes for every option would firstly need to be obtained.
Just my $0.02 worth.
