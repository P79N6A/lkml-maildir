hi Matthew and everyone
I use a 3COM Etherlink III ISA and a 3C905C PCI in my firewall
box (i440BX mobo). (distro is slackware 7.1, kernels are either
2.2.19 or 2.4.3, modutils 2.3.1 (slackware 7.1 default) ).
The 3C905C was never a problem (and i guess your R8029 isn't either), 
however to make the 3C509 ISA work, I had to disable PnP in the 
card's firmware, with 3COM tools : see
http://www.3com.com/products/html/prodlist.html?family=570&cat=20&pathtype=download&tab=cat&selcat=Network
%20Interface%20Cards%20%26%20Adapters
to download the DOS tools to configure your card without PnP, i.e.
manually
assigning an IRQ and address to it.
You'll have to declare to your BIOS that this particular IRQ is taken
by a non-PNP ISA card too.
Now it works well, whether i use a separate module or build the
module into the kernel.
I hope that helps.
