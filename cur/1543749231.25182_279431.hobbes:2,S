I'm strongly against adding this. The reason for that is that once an
ioctl is added, it realistically will and can never go away.
LSI is free to have their own fork and give that to dell; but they
should and could have known that it wasn't going to fly. (same I guess
for adaptec ioctls). The companies who then commit to some schedule
realize they take a huge risk, but that is no reason to foul up the
kernel more.
