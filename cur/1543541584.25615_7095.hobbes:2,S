And in the default case, icons are application properties that the Finder  
extracts from the application into the Finder database. (The same way it  
extracts the custom icon, incidentally, except it doesn't copy that one  
into its database.)
Note that custom icons are a very late MacOS feature. The Finder database,  
OTOH, is older than hierarchical filesystems. And it still works  
essentially the same way as in the beginning.
And to get back to Unix permission problems with this concept:
1. Yes, MacOS *does* have the concepts of owner, group, and permissions.  
It just restricts those to network filesystems (and other networking  
stuff).
2. When you don't have permissions to change a MacOS file (be it network  
permissions or simply a read-only flag), guess what?
    *You cannot manipulate the custom icon for that file*.
Why would Linux need something different?
