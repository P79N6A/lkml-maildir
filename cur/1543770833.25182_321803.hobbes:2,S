From my memory DRM drivers have direct path to the vertical retrace
through the current ioctl() interface. It's not an issue for that driver
and probably many others that use simple syscalls like that.
The RT patch isn't hard to maintain and only one jerk-off objected to
it without providing any useful information why the single kernel
approach is faulty other than it jars his easily offended sensibilities
