Just question.
As far as I know, customer has two different requeremtn of the page fault.
  (1) collect number of all page fault
      -> if it is too large, too many interrupt decrease performance.
  (2) collect number of major page fault
      -> major page fault indicate to increase random access I/O,
         then, some customer want to collect major page fault
         (don't include minor page fault)
Is this patch fill (2) requirement?
