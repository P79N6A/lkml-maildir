Well, I can't seem to find the right collection of patches applying
cleanly on 2.6.12-rc6 and the Adaptec BIOS says "ASYNC". It cannot
go below 10MB/s and the tape unit can't go above 3.3 according to
/proc/scsi/aic7xxx/0 I think:
Target 4 Negotiation Settings
        User: 6.600MB/s transfers (16bit)
        Goal: 3.300MB/s transfers
        Curr: 3.300MB/s transfers
        Channel A Target 4 Lun 0 Settings
                Commands Queued 61
                Commands Active 0
                Command Openings 1
                Max Tagged Openings 0
                Device Queue Frozen Count 0
So, I'm kind of stuck with a very slow driver initialization. I think it
takes much longer than the 30 seconds visible in the logfile, at least
that's the impression I have (I'll use a stopwatch next time).
