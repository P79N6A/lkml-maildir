This reminds me of an idea I had years ago, but never really looked in
to very much, (it may well have been implemented somewhere
independently of my idea anyway).  Basically, it was for a multi-cpu
machine which, instead of running cpus in parallel, with all the
common scaling problems, ran each CPU in series for a very short
timeslice, effectively being a uni-processor machine, but moving the
state of the processor's registers between physical CPUs.  The theory
was that it would be possible to clock each CPU much higher for a
short period of time than it could be successfully clocked
continuously.  Physical CPUs with poor cooling could even be given a
shorter timeslice.
