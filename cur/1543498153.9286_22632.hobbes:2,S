Yes.  At boot I have:
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: SONY      Model: CD-RW  CRX100E    Rev: 1.0j
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
scsi : detected 1 SCSI cdrom total.
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 24x/24x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
                      ^^^
Btw, for some reason the first number above seems to be different
between boots.  I've seen 4x, 8x and 24x.  The drive was sold as (and
works with) 2x write cd/rw, 4x write cd/r, 24x read.  I'm not sure if
that's at all related, but it is a strange thing.
Thanks,
