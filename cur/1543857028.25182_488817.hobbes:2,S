Nonsense, one obvious user would be the scheduler, the current scheduler 
tick emulation is rather ugly and sort of explains why you need the 
special wakeup logic I saw in previous versions.
The scheduler should be completely separate from hrtimer, in the long term 
they might optionally not even use the same clock source (e.g. the 
scheduler would use a low resolution, but fast clock, while posix timer 
whould use the high resolution timer).
bye, Roman
