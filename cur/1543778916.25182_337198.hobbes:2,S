just tried unpatched 2.6.12.3.
The Box stalls booting with 
"Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
_"
interesting though that led hdd light is off at first, blinks few
times, and 1-2 secs after it stalls with above message - it gets its
steady green light on.
Could I screw up some NEW kernel configuration parameters when pulling
config from 2.6.8 from Debian? I don't know :-/
I will try 2.6.13-rc4 now... heh heh
