Yep ie. a page that's freed or being freed.

It is also done by remove_exclusive_swap_page, although that hunk
leaked into a later patch (#5), sorry.
Other methods (eg truncate) don't seem to have an atomicity guarantee
anyway - ie. it is valid to pick up a reference on a page that is
just about to get truncated. PageFreeing is only used when some code
is making an assumption about the number of users of the page.

There isn't because higher order pages aren't used for pagecache.

There are appropriate memory barriers: the radix tree is
modified uner the rwlock/spinlock, and this function has
a memory barrier before testing page != *pagep.

What's wrong with the lockless radix tree lookups?

You don't seem to have looked enough to conclude anything about it.
