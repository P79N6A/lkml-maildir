Hi Andrew,
Here is the second version of the ext3, mostly bug fixes and made the
changes you have suggested last time.  
It's a stable version now.  We have done overnight fsx tests on a 2 CPU
PIII 700MHz box, did not see any issues. We also run tiobench and untar
tests.
> - Please use u32 for block numbers everywhere.
I tried to make the changes as you suggested: use u32 for block numbers
everywhere.  Then hit a problem: sometimes, especially when doing block
allocation or find a free block on bitmap, on success, it returns the
block number, on fail, it returns -1 to indicate the failure.  I found
we can't use the u32 for those cases. ext3_new_block() and
ext3_free_block() did the same thing.  So I just did wherever I could to
make a block number from int to u32, and keep it int if it also means
failure in the fail case. Hmm...Is there any good way to do this?

Done.

Re-organized.  Merged conditions together and put them into a single loop.  Now it does not contains any goto :-) See if the code looks clean and now...

Planning to do right after this version. Besides enable/disable the
reservation feature, I am thinking to enable the feature that could set
the the default reservation window size(in blocks) when the fs is
mounted.   just one single mount option:"prealloc_window=n". When n=0,
it means turns off, when n>0, it means on, and the ext3 default
reservation window size for each file is n blocks(or 8 blocks, if 0< n <
8).
> - Make sure that you have a many-small-file test.  Say, untar a kernel

Yes, have done this: untar linux-2.6.4 kernel tree to a clean ext3
filesystem. Verified the reservation is being discarded and the small
files are contiguous on-disk.
> Apart from that, looking good.  Where are the benchmarks? ;)
One simple dd test, it's 4 times faster with the patch on a 2 way PIII
700Mhz box:
# cat /tmp/dd-large.sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=x1 bs=4k count=5000 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=x2 bs=4k count=5000 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=x3 bs=4k count=5000 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=x4 bs=4k count=5000 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=x5 bs=4k count=5000 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=x6 bs=4k count=5000 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=x7 bs=4k count=5000 &
dd if=/dev/zero of=x8 bs=4k count=5000 &
elm3b92:/mnt # time /tmp/dd-large.sh
# time /tmp/dd-large.sh
real    0m0.431s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.009s
linux-2.6.4 kernel + ext3 reservation patch, window size 128 blocks:
# time /tmp/dd-large.sh
real    0m0.098s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.009s
We also did tiobench sequential write tests on ext2, jfs and ext3 on
different number of threads(1,4,8,16,32 and 64), block size is 4k, file
size is 4000k.  For ext3, we tried different reservation size from 8 to
128 blocks, as well as without any reservation.  The test was done on a
8CPU PIII 700 i386 machine with 4G memory, on linux-2.6.4 kernel+patch
and linux2.6.4-mm1 kernel.  
Attached is a graphic file show the tiobench results. It shows that
before the patch, the sequential write throughput on ext3 is pretty bad
compare with ext2 and jfs; with the patch, it's much better. And the
block allocation on disk for the files created is much less fragmented.
Planning to do dbench and other regression test later. Just what to
share with you the current status. 
Patch attached below.
Thanks!
