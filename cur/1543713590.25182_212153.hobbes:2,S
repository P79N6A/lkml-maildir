Hi There,
I have a special card that is able to run my ancient Sync on Green, 60
Hz (vertical) monitor. It's a 21", genuine trinitron tube monitor with
excellent colour definition and I like it - it's my precioussss and
we're not going to stop using it.
Now, this monitor and my video card display the following
characteristics:
 * if it runs in graphical mode the scan modelines MUST be 60 Hz
   (vertical) _and_ it must be within about 1% of 60Hz
 ModeLine "Left 1280x1024"   108.00 1280 1284 1452 1680 1024 1030 1033
 1066 -hsync -vsync
 - if the values change or go "wrong" the video card and adapter get
   totally confused and essentially I lose sync and can't get it back
   again
 * if it runs in text mode it runs fine
It does NOT run in Framebuffer mode nicely.
Now, I've downloaded:
  2.6.4 (from the Debian source tree)
  
  and
  2.6.4 (from a kernel.org mirror)
  ...now I've turned off framebuffer support but 2.6.4 sends my
  monitor/card combo into no-sync. I've set the "video=vga16:off" in
  lilo.
Funnily enough, I've basically imported the settings from my older
2.6.0-test9 [a Debian version] which DOES work and it still upsets my
monitor. It works under 2.4.18-bf2.4.
I am wondering what might have changed if anything...
