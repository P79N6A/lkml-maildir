There was some talk about making a userspace and kernelspace versions
of libgcrypt, to come out of the gpg people in .de (Werner Koch and
friends).  This would also have support for hardware crypto, available
both from userspace and kernelspace.  Last I had heard, they had made
a libgcrypt that called gpg, rather than a gpg that called
libgcrypt... duh.
