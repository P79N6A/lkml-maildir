Doesnt mean a lot. An 8Mb memory chip has 64 million memory cells, each of
which may only show problems in combination patterns. The fact that the
ram makes it show up is suspicious. If you can find another 8Mb simm from
somewhere that would help eliminate that one.
Is your machine old enough to require extra cache tag ram above 16Mb - it
seems unlikely
