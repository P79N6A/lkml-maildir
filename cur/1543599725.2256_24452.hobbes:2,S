I've suddenly started getting host not responding messages
on NFS mounts. The mounts are from Solaris8 and HPUX-10.20.
Other Solaris8 machines don't have this problem,
and the machines serving the mounts are unloaded, and responsive.
2.4.7-ac10 worked fine.2.4.8-ac8 through 2.4.9-ac3
have trouble. I have not tested 2.4.8-ac[1..7] yet.
Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.15-pre6 (July 2, 2001)
