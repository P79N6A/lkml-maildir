Michael,
in:
+static int find_busiest_node(int this_node)
+{
+ int i, node = this_node, load, this_load, maxload;
+ 
+ this_load = maxload = atomic_read(&node_nr_running[this_node]);
+ for (i = 0; i < numnodes; i++) {
+  if (i == this_node)
+   continue;
+  load = atomic_read(&node_nr_running[i]);
+  if (load > maxload && (4*load > ((5*4*this_load)/4))) {
+   maxload = load;
+   node = i;
+  }
+ }
+ return node;
+}
You changed ((5*4*this_load)/4) to:
  (5*4*(this_load+4)/4)
or
  (4+(5*4*(this_load)/4))  ?
We def need some constant to avoid low load ping pong, right?
Finally I added in the 04 patch, and that helped

perhaps increase INTERNODE_LB?
