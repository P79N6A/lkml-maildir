Hi,
when using the 2.6.23-rc5-git1 kernel and trying to change a network 
device name, I have the following error:
device_rename: sysfs_create_symlink failed (-17)
That comes from drivers/base/core.c : 1261
I know anything about sysfs, so no much help to give... :(
I don't know if this is a bug, but my code use device_rename, check the 
return value and fails. I will ignore it, but it seems not to be a 
correct behavior to have such error.
Easy to reproduce:
	load a dummy network driver => dummy0
	change its name with : ip link set name foo0 dev dummy0
Thanks.
