Undskyld - vi plejer at tilføje en beskrivelse... her kommer den:
Umbrella is a security mechanism which implements a combination of 
process-based Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and authentication of files 
through Digital Signed Binaries (DSB) for Linux based consumer electronics 
devices ranging from mobile phones to settop boxes.
Umbrella is implemented on top of the Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework. 
The MAC scheme is enforced by a set of restrictions on each process. This 
policy is distributed with a binary in form of execute restrictions (in the 
file signature) and within the program, where the developer has the 
opportunity of making a "restricted fork" for setting restrictions for new 
children.
