The patches I got were maximal, too much junk.
So I went for a minimal version instead.
It is usable (when the kernel part is stable, which it isn't today)
but mount/losetup may well acquire a few options before it is
conveniently usable.
(I do not read crypto lists, and see only a very small fraction of
what passes by on lk, so if you want to influence util-linux
an explicit cc is a good idea.)

cryptoloop as it went in is essentially hvr's.
