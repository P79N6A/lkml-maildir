Warning - this hidden area could have been used to circumvent some
security, hold viruses,
steal data, whatever.  I have unfortunately seen this trick more times
than I care to 
get into.
If this disk drive is installed on a computer where such things are
a possibility, then I suggest bringing system down to single user mode,
having a witness
by your side, then resizing the disk and using dd to grab contents of
the "new" blocks,
so you can inspect it.  
With the right software, and access to the sg driver, then one can
easily use this area as
their own private repository to keep stuff until the opportunity
presents itself to take
the data offsite.  
FYI, there is no way to prevent somebody from resizing disk in this way
if they can write
to the sg driver, some of our customers use our software to resize in
this way and to monitor
changes, but you can really just set up a shell script to do this
yourself.
