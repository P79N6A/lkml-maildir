	I pointed out this problem years ago, during 2.4.  Some may
think this was going overboard, but, to avoid legal liability, I
closed the FTP area of the ftp.yggdrasil.com kernel mirror that
included the kernels with the infringing firmware (not that many
people used it then).
	At that time, I also posted patches to remove the code
and a GPL'ed utility to automatically load the right firmware
from userland on a hotplug event when the device is plugged in.  At
least one person posted that he tried the code and it worked fine.
	I believe that Greg Kroah-Hartmann said that the changes
should go into 2.5.  I'm still waiting, although I don't know if
I even have a copy of the user level helper code anymore.
	I am not a lawyer, so please do not take the following as
legal advice.
	I believe that distribution of Linux kernel binaries that
compile in this firmware is direct copyright infringment, and
that distribution of Linux kernel modules that compile in
this firmware is contributory copyright infringement (to the direct
infringmenet that occurs when the image is created in RAM, and
there are US court cases that say that copying into RAM is copying
for the purposes of copyright).
	The United States Copyright Office has issued a copyright
registration to Yggdrasil Computing for some software in the Linux
USB serial drivers.  Yggdrasil Computing has never given permission
for distribution of GPL-incompatible firmware with that software.
