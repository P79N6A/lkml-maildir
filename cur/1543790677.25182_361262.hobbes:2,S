Do not know about is it better or not, but you can use
a bit in connector header flags to specify if kernelspace has
64 or 32 bit ABI, so your userspace application could use it's own 
__gid_t/__uid_t which match the kernel.
Since connector header has always the same size, you will not have
problems except usage of own, probably non-standard, types.
