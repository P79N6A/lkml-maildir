Based on a comparison of E 08 with the three omap-clks1 commits you 
mentioned above, here are some differences that would merit further 
attention.  Some of these you've mentioned in subsequent E-mails.
If you use your patches, I would suggest making the following changes:
1. "remove unnecessary calls to propagate_rate()" should keep the 
propagate_rate(&ck_dpll1) call in omap1_select_table_rate(), since this 
function is only used by struct clk virtual_clk_mpu.  virtual_clk_mpu is 
farther away from the root of the clock tree than struct clk ck_dpll1.
2. In plat-omap2/clock.c, clk_set_rate() and clk_set_parent() should call 
propagate_rate() after recalc.
3. Several internal calls to *_recalc() functions can be dropped - 
specifically, in omap2_reprogram_dpllcore(), omap2_select_table_rate(), 
omap3_noncore_dpll_set_rate(), and omap3_core_dpll_m2_set_rate().
If you merge E 08, I'd suggest the following changes:
1. In clock24xx.c:omap2_clk_init(), your patches call propagate_rate() on 
osc_ck and sys_ck immediately after recalcs, which looks like a good 
idea to me.
2. The mach-omap1/clock.c:omap1_clk_init() change to consolidate the two 
propagate_rate(&ck_dpll1) calls also is good.
Please let me know if you'd like any followup patches here.
