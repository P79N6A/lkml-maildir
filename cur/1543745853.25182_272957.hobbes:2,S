Hello,
While compiling the lastest 2.4 kernel I stumbled on this error:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.28/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer
-pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i586  -DMODULE  -nostdinc
-iwithprefix include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=dn_dev  -c -o dn_dev.o dn_dev.c
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.28/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer
-pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i586  -DMODULE  -nostdinc
-iwithprefix include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=dn_neigh  -c -o dn_neigh.o
dn_neigh.c
dn_neigh.c:584: `THIS_MODULE' undeclared here (not in a function)
dn_neigh.c:584: initializer element is not constant
dn_neigh.c:584: (near initialization for `dn_neigh_seq_fops.owner')
make[2]: *** [dn_neigh.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.28/net/decnet'
make[1]: *** [_modsubdir_decnet] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.28/net'
make: *** [_mod_net] Error 2
I followed the same steps as always to do the compilation:
- I copied linux-2.4.27/.config to linux-2.4.28/.config
- I made an "make oldconfig" in the 2.4.28 directory
- Then I tried to compile the kernel and the modules, as usual, with "make
dep; make clean; make bzImage; make modules"
I Googled the archives of the list to see if someone had reported this
error, but I didn't seem to find anything about it. I found a patch for a
similar error (from quite a while ago) and tried it, and the compilation
went fine.
The patch is very simple, I just added the line:
#include <linux/module.h>
To dn_neigh.c and ¡voilá! the compilation went without a single warning at
that point.
I got this error in three different Linux machines.
Greetings.
