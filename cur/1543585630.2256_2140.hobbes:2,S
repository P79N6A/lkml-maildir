That sounds vaguely sensible.  However, make it a "much less likely" rather
than an "impossible", otherwise we end up with an unkillable runaway root
process killing everything else in userland.
I'm still in favour of a failing malloc(), and I'm currently reading a bit
of source and docs to figure out where this should be done and why it isn't
done now.  So far I've found the overcommit_memory flag, which looks kinda
promising.

As I said above, "immune" can be dangerous.  "Extremely hard" would be
better terminology and behaviour.  It also helps that the current weighting
in badness() appears to leave getty processes alone, since they don't
consume much and normally have long uptimes - also I believe init would try
to restart them anyway.
