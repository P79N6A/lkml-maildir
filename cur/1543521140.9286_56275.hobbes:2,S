Consider Windows NT 64b:
type        bits
char           8
short int     16
int           32
long int      32
(void *)      64
Basically, they went the P64 way, that is: pointers are 64 bit,
everything else is as in 32 bit Windows. If you want 64 bit integer,
you have to use __int64, or something like that. The reason was that
they wanted the API to stay the same, and in Windows API nearly every
parameter is long. They did not want them to be 64 bit (hysterical
reasons, afaik).
Unices are in general LP64 - longs and pointers are 64 bit, integers
are 32 bit, shorts 16 bit and chars 8 bit.
