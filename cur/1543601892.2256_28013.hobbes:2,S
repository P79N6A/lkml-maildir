Absolutely agreed.
Ben and I have already been thinking a bit about memory
objects, so we have both reverse mappings AND we can skip
copying the page tables at fork() time (needing to clear
less at the subsequent exec(), too) ...
Of course this means I'll throw away my pte-based reverse
mapping code and will look at an object-based reverse mapping
scheme like Ben made for 2.1 and DaveM made for 2.3 ;)

Rik
