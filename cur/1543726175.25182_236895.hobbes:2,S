  I'm having similar problems running vanilla 2.6.7 with Debian-amd64 on an 
Athlon 64 using a Philips DVDR824P. It refuses to read some of my dvd+r discs 
to the end, while some may even refuse to mount. In both cases the errors are 
of the "attempting to access beyond end of device" type. 
Interestingly the same discs on my laptop with 2.6.7 and an LG GCA-4040N 
dvd+rw writer read fine. After some time (and some cd burns later) one of the 
discs which used to give errors on the Philips writer started to read fine 
again, which left me a bit confused.
  Sorry for not being too detailed about system configuration at this time. If 
you have interest in this, I can give more detailed system info and try to 
report as soon as this happens again with the exact error messages. 
Unfortunately I have not yet managed to create a test iso image or similar 
which would reproduce the problem reliably, but I can add that something 
similar also happenned with cdroms.
Best regards
Claudio
