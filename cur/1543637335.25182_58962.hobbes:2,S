The man page for hdparm is a bit dated on the -u flag allowing ints during
i/o, warning about the dangers of using kernels older than 2.0.13. No
problem there, but what are the more current implications?
I would think that this would be safe when using DMA, and likely to be
safe for PIO and more recent chipsets, but I wouldn't want to actually
tell anyone that.
Therefore:
 1 - the man page would benefit from an update regarding recent kernels
     from this millenium, if only to reassure readers.
 2 - any better way to tell if allowing ints will cause problems than just
     to try it? Not desirable on large machines, but it was off and I am
     seeing serial problems on the OOB access modem.
