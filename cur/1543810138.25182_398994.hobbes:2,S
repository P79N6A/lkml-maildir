Hmmm, I think it makes totally sense there. While it is useful in the
suspend case, it would also be useful to the current implementation that
use the crypto API. Think about creating a compressed volume with
cryptoloop of dm-crypt.

OK, could you point me to the ugly thinks. I see message passing between
the userspace application and the kernel, for which I think that netlink
is a good choice.
What has to be done to make the code not ugly? Is there a way to fix it
to become acceptable?
