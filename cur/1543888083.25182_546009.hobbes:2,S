I'll try and get hold of AIM7, I have some AIM9 results (please
see the attachment, since the results overflow 80 columns, I've
attached them).

This would make a good test case for the RSS and the unmapped page
cache controller. Thanks for bringing it to my attention.

oops! I wonder if AIM7 creates too many processes and exhausts all
memory. I've seen a case where during an upgrade of my tetex on my
laptop, the setup process failed and continued to fork processes
filling up 4GB of swap.

VM debugging is always fun!
