I try. Unfortunately I don't have nearly as much time as I would like,
to work on the kernel, but when I do have time I try to fix bugs. If
you look through the mailing list archives you will see that I try to
fix bugs/buglets most of the time and I find these by combing through
the coverity database, bugzilla, the mailing list, logs of test builds
of new kernels etc etc...
I don't maintain lists of unfixed bugs. I would love to do so, but I
lack the time to do it properly.
