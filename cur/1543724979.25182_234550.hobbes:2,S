I guess it looks good enough for me. I'd say send it to Andrew when
you're ready.
George, do you have any additional comments?
Although you still have the issue w/ NTP adjustments being ignored, but
last time I looked at the time_interpolator code, it seemed it was being
ignored there too, so at least your not doing worse then the ia64
do_gettimeofday(). [If I'm doing the time_interpolator code a great
injustice with the above, someone please correct me]

I'll try to remember to cc you on the 2.7 code when I get the first pass
ready (re-implementing the NTP mechanism is the last blocker). I'm sure
to appreciate additional feedback from non i386 arch specific views.
thanks
