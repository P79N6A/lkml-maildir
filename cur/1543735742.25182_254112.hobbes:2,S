While I definitly approve this patch is there a specific reason for this
array instead of individual members like
	lock_cnt, open_cnt, close_cnt, etc..?
also the optional counters seem to be largely overlapping, why not always
all four thta exist and if some drivers don't want to update them they'd
just not update them
