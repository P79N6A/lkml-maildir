Subject: [PATCH] LED: add support to leds with readable status
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/16/53

Some led hardware allows drivers to query the led state, and this patch
adds a hook to let the led class take advantage of that information when
available.
Without this functionality, when access to the led hardware is not
exclusive (i.e. firmware or hardware might change its state behind the
kernel's back), reality goes out of sync with the led class' idea of what
the led is doing, which is annoying at best.
Behaviour for drivers that do not or cannot read the led status is
unchanged.
