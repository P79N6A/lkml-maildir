Perhaps that will be a lesson to the self-styled "Hacker of social systems"
that there is a reason he has two ears and only one mouth.  
As a low-evel hacker he needed to elicit support from others to get his work
recognised and included.  He was unwilling to listen to advice and criticism
from those who know a lot better than him, and his work was not of such obvious
brilliance that people were prepared to accept it without change.
He was not prepared to make the changes folks wanted, so he took his ball and
went away in a strop.

I certainly don't miss his signatures.  I considered a lot of them to be
offensively off-topic and needlessly provocative.
