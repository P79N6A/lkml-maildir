I am also experiencing this. My dual P-120 with Neptune
chipset is sometimes slower on tasks (x11amp in particular)
than my single P-100 with Triton chipset.
I suspect that at least part of the reason is due to the RT
process switching CPUs too much though. The rest is probably
due to the fact that this Neptune board has crappy L2 cache
management and worse behaviour for memory > 64MB (I have 72).
Maybe cache colouring would be worth it after all :))
