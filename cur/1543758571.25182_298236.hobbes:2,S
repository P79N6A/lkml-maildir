It would be much easier for us to point you in the right direction if you
stopped thinking "we must call shell scripts from the keyboard driver", and
explain what problem you're trying to solve (i.e., *WHY* are you trying to
do this - is it "we need a keystroke logger", "we need keypress timing and
latencies", or some other higher-level explanation of your problem)....
