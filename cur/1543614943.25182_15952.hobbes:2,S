it still requires some dumb^Wpoor sap to go in pruning them,
plus once it gets to a certain point, there will be dupes.
Oh boy will there be dupes. People will check for them first you say?
Some people are _still_ getting "Loop doesn't compile in 2.4.14"
messages.
Why search archives when you can be the 900th person to ask the
same question.  Even Richard Gooch's page for showing whats wrong
with the current kernel and how to fix it to get it to compile
seems to be completly overlooked. Maybe if it were moved to
www.kernel.org people would see it ? *shrug*
