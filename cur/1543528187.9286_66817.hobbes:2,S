Ok.
By the way, scsi_ioctl_send_command() declares the variables 'inlen',
'outlen', 'needed' and 'buf_needed' as '_signed_ int' but all its code is
dealing with them as if they were 'unsigned'. This looks like a more
serious bug to me given that inputs come from user-space.
How much currect am I there ? :-)

I noticed the problem when testing my latest driver changes (couldn't
mount my CD/ROM), but haven't have time to investigate. :-)
