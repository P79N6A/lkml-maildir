Just because someone uses something for a stated purpose does not mean that it is good for that purpose or the best for that purpose.  I have seen people use spreadsheets for databases and page layout programs, for example.  People will use whatever they have available or are told to by upper management.  This is why Microsoft's advertising is pitched to management types and not technical types.  (Technical types do not make major purchacing decisions any more, sad to say.)
But then again, I have never figured out why a server box needs a gui tightly coupled with the kernel...
