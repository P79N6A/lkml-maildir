I think it means very wrong system clock in ACPI state. Plus think
something wanting timeout of five minutes, then suspend one minute
after, machine sleeps for a hour.
With this approach, timeout should happen just after resume, with your
approach, it would wait 4 more minutes.
[Perhaps it needs to call lost_ticks or something like that.]
