Hi, Nick.
Glad to see you're back on this.  It's been on my list, but delayed by
other patch streams...
As I mentioned to you in prior mail, I want to try to integrate this
atop my "auto/lazy migration" patches, such that when a task moves to a
new node, we remove just that task's pte ref's to page cache pages
[along with all refs to anon pages, as I do now] so that the task will
take a fault on next touch and either use an existing local copy or
replicate the page at that time.  Unfortunately, that's in the queue
behind the memoryless node patches and my stalled shared policy patches,
among other things :-(.
Also, what kernel is this patch against?  Diffs just say "linux-2.6".
Somewhat ambiguous...
