which would be a false positive. Sam, what would be your preference to 
annotate the code in such cases?

the problem here is that the type you export to user-space is the _wrong_ 
(narrow) type. Including types.h is one thing - exporting something to 
user-space is another thing. It might not matter in practice.
Furthermore, the 3 blocks are there as well - while there should only be 
two.
