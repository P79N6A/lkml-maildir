ok. so. theoretically - as long as the system finds all 16 drives, I should be 
able to shuffle them around and attach them to whichever controller there is? 
right?
ok.
now, I've replaced the faulty controller, and booting up. the new controller 
is also (like the old one) a CMD649...
hæ?
it works. but it surely didn't work last time...
thanks
