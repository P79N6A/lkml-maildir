Why not design the DCO so that it assumes an author accepts the most 
recent published version unless specified. You could then shorten the 
line to:
DCO-Sign-Off: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>
And if they wanted to specify a version, use something like:
DCO-Sign-Off: Random J Developer <random@developer.org> [DCO 1.0]
You could also define the signoff line to use different delimiters for 
various types of information, to allow for all of these "custom" ideas 
that contributing companies may feel they "need".
For example, say any text not enclosed by any delimiters is considered a 
name, anything in <> is an email, in [] is a DCO version, and {} allows 
for optional information. This would allow for stuff like Yarroll 
submitted while I was typing this email, for example:
DCO-Sign-Off: La Monte H.P. Yarroll <piggy@timesys.com> [DCO 1.0] {TS00062}
Nothing other than name and email would be required, but they would be 
available for those that wish to use them. This would make it easy for 
scripts to sort out the info on this line.
