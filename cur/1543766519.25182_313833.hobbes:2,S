Ah, but you misunderstand, there was no mind reading (nor is there any
ill will or serious admonition of the people or the process). I saw the
patch on the list by Adrian in November and applied it to my branch of
the aacraid driver in anticipation of its acceptance. This is a case of
the patch dropping on the floor and I am wondering where it got lost 'in
the system'.
Adrian did the right thing by resending it. However, resending it also
shows that the community was denied a patch for 5 months.
Maybe we should institute a procedure where the 'Signed-off-by' person
is privately mailed an ACK or NAK at each stage of acceptance of a patch
they authored? But that does not deal with patches that are dropped on
the floor though.
Sincerely -- Mark Salyzyn

I'm sorry, owing to interference from the American Institute of
Parapsychology, the telepathic patch transmission service into the SCSI
tree has been discontinued.  The upshot is that if you apply a patch to
your tree, it doesn't actually appear in mine unless you actually send
it to the SCSI list and shepherd its progress.
