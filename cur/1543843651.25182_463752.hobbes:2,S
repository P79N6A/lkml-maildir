Hmm ... this might explain why we're having a hard time here ... me
thinks: Ingo don't see that dynamic tracing is orthogonal to static
markup and Ingo don't see that my explanation is orthogonal to
Roman's (i.e. I did factually explain stuff and did resort to
sarcasm as part of said explanation) ... maybe Ingo does not like
orthogonal stuff ...
That _too_ was sarcastic.
