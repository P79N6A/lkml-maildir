2.4 has the 'return ESTALE if current dir fails d_revalidate()'
test. Looks like the vfat stuff has the same problem that 
Sigh... Can we perhaps add FS_ALWAYS_REVAL in order to flag what kind
of behaviour filesystems expect in link_path_walk()? NFS needs
revalidation on all open() calls (including opendir(".")), so removing
the ESTALE code is not an option.
