Subject: Failure to Compile AIC7xxx Driver

If nobody has brought this up yet, I want to report this issue.
Here is what happened when I tried to build the aic7xxx driver for 2.4.9:
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l: In function `yylex':
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l:115: `T_VERSION' undeclared (first use in this function)
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l:115: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l:115: for each function it appears in.)
aicasm/aicasm_scan.l:132: `T_STRING' undeclared (first use in this function)
This is for the new driver, BTW.
If this has already been brought up, sorry for being redudant.  Send flames 
and letter bombs to my address.
