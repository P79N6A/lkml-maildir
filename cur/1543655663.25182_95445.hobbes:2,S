Yes.  I'm also 99% certain it won't solve the problem.  Really, the
only way to get this right is to make sure all the state is out where
GDB will see it and protect it.  But it sounds like doing this on S/390
and ia64 is prohibitively complicated.
I'll think about it.  If we can't come up with anything better we may
want to just make this behave correctly on those architectures that can
do it.
