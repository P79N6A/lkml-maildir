It needs to be tight. Helper may not do anything below after it frozen
rest of userland.

We don't "enforce" rules in kernel, too, still it seems to
work. Helper needs similar level of auditing to kernel code. It is not
your average GUI application.

Take a look at code. State is still atomically snapshoted with
interrupts disabled, in kernel.
