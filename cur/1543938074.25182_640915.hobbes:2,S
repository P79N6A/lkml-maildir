If they migrate they buy a new run-time licence.  These costs about a
thousand dollars for small sites.

That's not a very useful metric.  It says nothing about what the benefit
will be.  Will any job complete sooner?  Not measurably.  Will less
hardware be required?  No.

I think I do.  You appear to be arguing that small businesses, such as
paint shops or garages, could re-install iBCS2 support.  That is, of
course, a nonsense in any other sense other than the purely theoretical,
devoid as it is of realities such as--and this is just the most
obvious--a sound business case.  It's just not going to happen that
way.  Perhaps it's best we all ignore the outburst.
I've stated the disadvantage, such as it is, in removing iBCS.  What's
the benefit?  Is it, as I say, a tiny performance improvement per exec
versus removing an itch that leads towards market domination? :)
