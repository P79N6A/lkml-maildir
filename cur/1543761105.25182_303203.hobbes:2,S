Loading the usb drivers on my machine dumps 155 lines into dmesg. Surely
that's a bit excessive?
But really for me it's the network drivers that actually annoy me. They dump
stuff into dmesg during the regular course of operation. As a result it
doesn't take long until the boot messages leave the buffer. Of course they're
in the log files, but running dmesg and getting screenfulls of the same
messages about boring network events over and over just annoys me.
