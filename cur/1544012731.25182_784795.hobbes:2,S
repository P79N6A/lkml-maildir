No problem ;)  like anything, it's only ever perfectly clear to the guy

Fundamentally init would now know that the apache service terminated,
and with what exit code or by what signal.
Right now, all we know is that a process terminated (and why) - we can't
link that back to a service in any kind of foolproof manner.
With the ability to do that, when the apache service dies, we can log
that in a more useful manner (including marking the service as down) -
but most importantly, we can respawn it!
This is something we can't do with processes that daemonise right now.
