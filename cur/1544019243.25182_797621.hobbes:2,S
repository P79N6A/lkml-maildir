We can remove them in dmar.h. X86 exported iommu_detected and no_iommu
in several IOMMU code and we merged them into dmar.h. Seems that we
forgot to clean up dmar.h.

I think we could. The root problem is that X86 sets up IOMMU in a very
hacky way. When we added VT-d support to IA64, we needed to add the
hacky code to IA64 even though IA64 doesn't need it.
We need to clean up the code to set up IOMMUs. I'll try later.

Subject: [PATCH -tip] intel-iommu: no need to export iommu_detected and no_iommu in dmar.h
The users of intel-iommu (x86 and IA64) export iommu_detected and
no_iommu in their own iommu.h.
