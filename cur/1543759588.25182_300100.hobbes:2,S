Mmm, conflicts in NFS ?
nfsd/nfsctl.c reads:
static int __init init_nfsd(void)
{
...
    if (proc_mkdir("fs/nfs", NULL)) {
        struct proc_dir_entry *entry;
        entry = create_proc_entry("fs/nfs/exports", 0, NULL);
        if (entry)
            entry->proc_fops =  &exports_operations;
    }
...
But nfs-utils 1.0.7 say that you can mount nfsd at /proc/fs/nfsd.
What 'exports' would kernel use ? Just duplicate info or a bug ?
TIA
