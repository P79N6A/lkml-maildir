Are you able to mount a HFS formatted CDROM? Kernel 2.4.0-test6prex
(linuxppc) gives me:
root[7]#mount -t hfs /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom/
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/cdrom,
       or too many mounted file systems
This worked with 2.2.x kernels. Could, of course, be a bug in the cdrom
driver or in the mount program...
