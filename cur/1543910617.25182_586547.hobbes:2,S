No, although it sounded like you didn't see any use in these patches.
Which be true if you're just looking at solving the theoretical deadlocks,
but I just think they might be worth looking at to practically solve some
of them and just give better reclaim behaviour in general (but in saying
that I'm not excluding your patches).

I do of course. There is one thing to have a real lock deadlock
in some core path, and another to have this memory deadlock in a
known-to-be-dodgy configuration (Linus said last year that he didn't
want to go out of our way to support this, right?)... But if you can
solve it without impacting fastpaths etc. then I don't see any
objection to it.

I don't mean for correctness, but for throughput. If you're doing a
lot of network operations right near the memory limit, then it could
be possible that these deadlock paths get triggered relatively often.
With Christoph's patches, I think it would tend to be less.

The thing I don't much like about your patches is the addition of more
of these global reserve type things in the allocators. They kind of
suck (not your code, just the concept of them in general -- ie. including
the PF_MEMALLOC reserve). I'd like to eventually reach a model where
reclaimable memory from a given subsystem is always backed by enough
resources to be able to reclaim it. What stopped you from going that
route with the network subsystem? (too much churn, or something
fundamental?)

As a general statement, I agree of course ;)
