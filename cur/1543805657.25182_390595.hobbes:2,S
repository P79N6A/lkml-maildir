Actually, in the US, it is in fact illegal to bypass a protection scheme
*even if the content is something you have legal rights to*.

17 USC 1201(a)(1)(A) says:
(A) No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively
controls access to a work protected under this title. The prohibition contained
in the preceding sentence shall take effect at the end of the 2-year period
beginning on the date of the enactment of this chapter. 
The rest of 1201(a)(1) talks about getting an exemption, good for 3 years only,
to allow you to bypass a control for a non-infringing use.
Got that?  You have to apply for special permission to bypass to get data that
you have rights to use....
