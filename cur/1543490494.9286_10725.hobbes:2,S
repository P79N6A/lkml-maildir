Just understood that SCSI_DISK#_MAJOR stuff in 2.2 is nothing but a MAJOR 
illusion with regards to IO-request queuing.
Which is sad is that queuing hasn't been fixed in time. The current status
of the code is so unreadable that probably the only way to have a chance
to find a volunteer for that code is to export the Linux project to other
galaxies. 
Thanks for your explanations and sorry to have a so slow understanding.
Regards,
   Gérard.
