Thanks for all the help Willy,
Nothing from the grep:
[root@emu-5 net]# grep 8390.o /lib/modules/2.4.32/modules.dep
[root@emu-5 net]#
Exact list:
enable_irq
eth_type_trans
__kfree_skb
alloc_skb
ether_setup
crc32_le
kmalloc
cpu_raise_softirq
alloc_netdev
__out_of_line_bug
disable_irq_nosync
netif_rx
skb_over_panic
bitreverse
jiffies
softnet_data
prink
__const_udelay
Grepping 2 or 3:
[root@emu-5 net]# grep enable_irq /proc/ksyms
c010a5e0 enable_irq_R__ver_enable_irq
c0343610 matroxfb_enable_irq_R__ver_matroxfb_enable_irq
[root@emu-5 net]# grep printk /proc/ksyms
c011aee0 printk_R__ver_printk
[root@emu-5 net]# grep kmalloc /proc/ksyms
c0132c60 kmalloc_R__ver_kmalloc
c03c07e0 sock_kmalloc_R__ver_sock_kmalloc
binutils version: 2.15.92.0.2 20040927
gcc: 3.4.2 20041017
My .config can be found here:
http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gnychis/.config
And I will try taking out CONFIG_MODVERSIONS support and let you know
how it goes!
By the way, i'm not keen on inserting 8390.o into the kernel, it was
simply the first thing i saw in my /lib/modules/2.4.32 directory, my
goal is to get any module at all to insert, because it seems none will
insert.
Thanks again!
George
