It is preferable since it massively reduces code duplication, and fixes
various minor issues found in the original serial driver.
As a result, it improves code maintainability since a fix to the semantics
of the serial layer will fix all drivers, instead of having to apply the
same fix to multiple serial drivers (which just doesn't happen.)
