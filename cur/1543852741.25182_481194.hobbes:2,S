Well, this is a different story.
My point is that if we call sys_sync() _anyway_ before calling
freeze_filesystems(), then freeze_filesystems() is _safe_ (either the
sys_sync() blocks, or it doesn't in which case freeze_filesystems() won't
block either).
This means, however, that we can leave the patch as is (well, with the minor
fix I have already posted), for now, because it doesn't make things worse a
bit, but:
(a) it prevents xfs from being corrupted and
(b) it prevents journaling filesystems in general from replaying journals
after a failing resume.
Still, there is a problem with the possibility of potential lock-up - either
with the bdevs-freezing patch or without it - due to a suspended dm device
down the stack and solving that is a _separate_ issue.
Now if we use the userland suspend, there's no problem at all, I think,
because s2disk calls sync() before it goes to suspend_system(), so the
admin will have a chance to unclock the system and everything is fine and
dandy (although it should be documented somewhere, IMHO).
However, if the built-in swsusp is used, then well ... <looks> ... we can put
a call to sys_sync() before prepare_processes() in pm_suspend_disk().
Greetings,
Rafael
