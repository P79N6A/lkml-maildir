Subject: about the performance of netfilter

we use a linux router. i just tested the performance of the router. when the kernel  is build without netfilter support,the throughput of 64bytes frame is about 45%. when i build the kernel with netfilter (only the ip_filter module),the throughput dropped to 24%, without any rules.
so is there some way to improve the performance? i just want some simple packet filter. is netfilter no so good on the performance compare to ipchains due to the improved functionality?
please cc.  thanks.
