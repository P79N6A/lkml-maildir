What part of "trace" "route" do you not understand?  If you are  
talking to your own subnet, there are no routers in between, so  
clearly there is nothing to trace.  A packet with TTL 0 is invalid,  
and a packet with TTL 1 will get to the host.

had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."
