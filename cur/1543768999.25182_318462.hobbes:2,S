To be more precise a vfsmount can only be in _at_ _most_ one
namespace.  When it is detached from a mount tree, it's no longer in
_any_ namespace.
There even seems to be some confusion about that in namespace.c.  I
think mnt_namespace should be set to NULL in detach_mnt() instead of
__put_namespace().
