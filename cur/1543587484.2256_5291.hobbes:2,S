these are covered in IEEE P100.13, D9 September 1997 AD212.  it is available
from IEEE for a "nominal" fee.
they are 4 defined subsets of POSIX that are deemed appropriate for real-time
systems.
unfortunately, the sub in subset is a small delta from the full set.
the subsets are:
	PSE51: Minimal Realtime System Profile
	PSE52: Realtime Controller System Profile
	PSE53: Dedicated Realtime System Profile
	PSE54: Multi-purpose Realtime System Profile.
now, PSE51 is already about 90% of POSIX, so I don't really see what is so
minimal about it.  the others require even more.
