Until 2.6, a stable series did not remove existing features, so someone
building an rpm or deb package could release it for "2.4.12 or later"
and expect it to work.
As a for instance there are people who went to 2.6 and kept their old
firwall rules written in ipchains, because they still worked. Now if
ipchains are deleted a full rewrite of firewall rules is needed, and
that just shouldn't be don't in haste. My personal opinion is that
ipfwadm and ipchains should have followed some other features into the
night before 2.6.0 ever came out. No one would have gotten a nasty
surprise later. I also think that reiser4 is 2.7 material, if there were
a 2.7.
I didn't see all that much wrong with the old odd/even model to tell the
truth, it wasn't perfect but you knew what you got.
