Thats a seperate issue in the pile. You might want to do things like
			lvm2 volumes
                             |
                           RAID-5
                       /  |  \   \
                    4 encrypted volumes with different keys
                       |      |         |        |
                             4 NBD disk volumes over TCP
			    (or 4 iSCSI volumes)
                     4 physical disks in different jurisdictions
(and the physical disks or iscsi volumes might in fact be over lvm2 on
the othe end - its all a lot more modular than just volume management at
least at the kernel level - tools is different)
