This refuses to boot here.  It dies when assigning the EHCI driver.  The mb is an MSI-7030 K8N Neo Platinium
based on a nForce 3 250Gb Chipset (x86_64).  I`ve been on vacation - the last kernel tried was 11-mm3 which
booted fine but refuses to use all the usb ports supplied by the system (two work, three do not all using low 
speed).
Any ideas what might be happening?
