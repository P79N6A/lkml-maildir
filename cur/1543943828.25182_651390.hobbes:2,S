and i'd like to apologize for the misleading Subject line which said 
"Subject: x86: ...". That i think made us miss the generic impact later 
on (we remind ourselves about non-arch/x86 patches via Subject line 
annotations and via looking at the diffstat before pull requests), and 
the accidentally missing diffstat just removed the last-line defense 
against such annotation mistakes.
btw., i was -->.<--- this close to removing this patch from x86.git 
altogether - because it had a bug (which already shows its 
non-obviousness) and i didnt think this complication was worth it. When 
that happened i took a really hard look at its correctness and 
worthiness and narrowly decided to keep it - but enforced an unusually 
long testing interval for this patch.
