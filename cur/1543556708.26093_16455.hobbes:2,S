Some new information:
I copied the cs46xx.c driver from 2.4.0-test11 to 2.4.0-test11-ac1,
rebuilt, and I got a test11-ac1 kernel which works with KDE 2.0 and sound.
I then repeated the same with 2.4.0-test12-pre6 (which failed earlier), and
it now works too, that is I can run 2.4.0-test12-pre6 with sound and
KDE 2.0, with the old test11(final) cs46xx sound driver compiled as a module.
I didn't try compiling the old driver into the kernel, but that should work 
too. I saved the test12-pre6 cs46xx.c in case further testing is needed.
Now I'll revert to 2.4.0-test11(final) as the ReiserFS folks are warning that 
test12-pre5 is unsafe with reiserfs; a fix is in progress.
