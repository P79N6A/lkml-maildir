         WinModems (just like all software-based modems) require software 
to run.  This software is the "brains" of the modem, unlike a 
hardware-based modem.  The problem is that since this piece of software 
contains most of the code to run the modem, the chipset makers do not give 
out the information needed to support these modems, as they would be giving 
away most of their design information.
         During testing it has been shown that some software-based modems 
require almost 33% of a P5/133 CPU to run reliably, so I usually recommend 
staying-away from these devices.
