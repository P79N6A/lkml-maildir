Subject: syscall macro fails upon compilation

I have been adding a syscall to the kernel (v 2.6.21); I am able to
compile and boot into the kernel. However, the userspace macro fails
to compile with the following message: "error: expected declaration
specifiers or â...â before âmycallâ". I could not find any solution
using google. I use the _syscall0 macro. Any suggestion would help.
Thanks!
