I have a spec that's labelled "IA-PC Multimedia Timers", preliminary
draft of June 2000, revision 0.97, which looks like the one mentioned
in your patch.
I also have something labelled "IA-PC HPET (High Precision Event
Timers) Specification", draft of February 2002, revision 0.98,
which is what drivers/char/hpet.c supports.
I admit I haven't compared them in great detail, but they certainly
*look* like they're close enough that the same driver could support
both, and the 0.98 revision history only mentions fairly cosmetic
changes (like the name :)).
Is there something specific that drivers/char/hpet.c expects that
your hardware doesn't implement?
