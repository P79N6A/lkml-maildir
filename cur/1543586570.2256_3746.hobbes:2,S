I am using reiserfs since kernel 2.2.14 or so.
It runs on my IBM Thinkpad without complications with kernel 2.4.3.
Same with a Compaq Proliant Server, kernel 2.4.2-ac28, two PIII and a 
hardware raid controller. I heard about complications with nfs.
I cannot see any speed improvements (maybe there are some beacause of 
the tree structure) but the file system check after a crash is much 
faster than with ext2.
It would be nice, if there are any hackers from the xfs, ext3 or jfs 
development team with some comparisons.
