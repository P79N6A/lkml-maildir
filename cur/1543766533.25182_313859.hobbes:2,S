I'm using stock 2.6.11.7 now.
Here is an strace of some piece of code of mine:
socket(PF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3
setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [12884901889], 4) = 0
bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(8002), inet_pton(AF_INET6, "::", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=0, sin6_scope_id=0}, 28) = 0
setsockopt(3, SOL_IPV6, IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP, "\1", 1) = 0
[...]
sendto(3, "ncp-lowfat-1.2.2", 16, 0, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(8002), inet_pton(AF_INET6, "ff02::6e63:7030", &sin6_addr), sin6_flowinfo=0, sin6_scope_id=0}, 28) = -1 EADDRNOTAVAIL (Cannot assign requested address)
ff02 is a link-local multicast address.  I've bound to ::.  How can this
fail?  link-local should always work, even if no routes are set and no
router has been found.
