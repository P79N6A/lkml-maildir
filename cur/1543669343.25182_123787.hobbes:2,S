The help entry for CONFIG_USB_MOUSE says:
  Say Y here only if you are absolutely sure that you don't want
  to use the generic HID driver for your USB keyboard and prefer
  to use the keyboard in its limited Boot Protocol mode instead.
  This is almost certainly not what you want.
  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called usbmouse.o. If you want to compile it as
  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
  If even remotely unsure, say N.
Based on that, I would hope it would have enough info to scare you from
trying to use it :)

Please use the HID driver, it will work out much better in the long run.

Yes, "autoclean" does not like usb drivers (among others.)  I don't
think any distro uses that anymore.
Glad it's working for you.
