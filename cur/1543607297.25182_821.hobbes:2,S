The two trees are certainly closely related - USB devices before USB hub,
USB hub before PCI etc. The scanner example works fine there, providing that
we are careful about memory issues - remember the USB layer allocates memory
to do any transaction, so the scanner has to complete its state save before 
we do any interrupt disabling/memory alloc freezing.

For scsi you have to complete the pending commands, you don't know what the
transaction granularity is in some cases and half completing the sequence
won't help you. In addition the upper layers have to queue additional scsi
commands to do stuff like cd drawer locking and to ask the drive firmware
to enter powerdown modes

That will scramble large numbers of devices. Randomly erroring pending block
writes is -not- civilised.
