Makes you wonder why drive manufacturers don't use some kind of NVRAM to 
simply remember the sectornumber that is being written as power fails - 
a capacitor, or even a small rechargeable battery (for the truely
paranoid), could supply the writing voltage. No (further) writing to the 
sector would be needed during spindown. And when the drive initializes 
again at boottime, it could check to see if the contents of the NVRAM is
not an "all OK" pattern, and simply rewrite the CRC of the sector in
question, unless that sector is already present in the bad-sector list
of the drive. 
Yes, this would be a bit more complex, and presents one more possible
point of failure, but the current situation seems rather abysmal...
And the data in that sector is as good as lost, anyway.
Regs,
Sven
