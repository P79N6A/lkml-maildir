Oh I think not.  My primary motivation in pushing on this point
of the design was to allow CPUSET 2a and 2b to have a smaller
cpumask than CPUSET 1a.  This is used for example to allow a job
that is running in 1a to setup two child cpusets, 2a and 2b,
to run two subtasks that are constrained to smaller portions of
the CPUs allowed to the job in 1a.
How would hacking cpuset_cpus_allowed() help here?
