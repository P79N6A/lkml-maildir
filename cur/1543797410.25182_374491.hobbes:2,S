I'm a little surprised that it makes it faster or smaller: I'd've thought that
the gcc optimiser would be up to caching the pointer; in fact, if it made any
difference, I'd've thought it'd make it larger, slower and consume more stack
space as the compiler would then have to carry the extra variable around.
OTOH, compiler's are black magic, possibly even blacker than kernels, so who
knows...
