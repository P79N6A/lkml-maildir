Another possibility would be to check the IP-ID of the echoed packet header.
Save the current IPID counter when the socket is created. Ignore the ICMP 
when the ID is older than the socket or wrapped. This gives an "ICMP window" 
of 2^31 packets, which should be more than enough. 
With the per destination IDs in 2.3 it is a bit more tricky, but not 
impossible. One way would be to go back to the global counter again
and just use the inetpeer secret as unique offset (so that you can
get back to the global counter with just a subtraction) 
 
The strange optimization of not using an IPID for DF packets would have
to go though. The global counter would not be slower than the current
inet_peer_idlock (same bus traffic)
Does this make sense?
