Not really. First, if the mmap() is hidden somewhere in glibc (i.e. as
part of malloc() or whatever) it's not really possible to do
MAP_POPULATE. Also, I need this for some memory that is allocated
during the whole runtime but only seldomly used. Thus I am happy if it
is swapped out, but everytime I want to use it I want to make sure it
is paged in before I pass it on to the RT thread. So, there's a
mmap() during startup only, and then, during the whole runtime of my
program I want to page in the memory again and again, with long
intervals in between, but with no call to mmap()/munmap().
