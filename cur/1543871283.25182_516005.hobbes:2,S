Hi Con/Willy, 
Just to chime on this thread, I've been testing Con's scheduler patches since 
he mentioned them to me. I have to say for desktop performance all processes 
running remain responsive (although with more resource hungry processes 
things get slower but remain responsive, but expected).  I have also been 
testing his scheduler on my work power workstation running 4 VMs with 4GB of 
ram on a dual-core EM64T box, again RSDL performs rather well balancing VM 
resources even while I have xmms running, xchat, beryl and a bunch of other 
stuff.  There is total response to each process.
Thanks, 
Shawn.
