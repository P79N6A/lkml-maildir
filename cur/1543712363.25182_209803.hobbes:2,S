Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't the max number of sectors in a
transfer limited to 255 instead of 256 because there were buggy
drives out there before ? I seem to recall something like that but
I could be wrong.
Of course I hope nobody in his right mind would take those old things,
slap a Marvel chip on it and sell it as new :) But someone else could
buy one of those SATA<->PATA converter cables with a Marvel on it and
run it with the old disk <shudder>. Wouldn't those cases bug out?

Naturally, see my comment above regarding SATA<->PATA converter cables.

Or.. should :)
