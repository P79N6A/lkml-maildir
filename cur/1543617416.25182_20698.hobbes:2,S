John,
The ppa_detect() must _not_ take the host_lock semaphore
as it is already taken by the mid level before it calls
ppa_detect(). [This will cause a lock up on an SMP
machine.]
The ppa_interrupt() should take the host_lock semaphore
before it calls scsi_done() (which calls up the scsi
driver stack).
The imm driver has been built by the same firm (Tim Waugh?)
and it looks correctly patched.
