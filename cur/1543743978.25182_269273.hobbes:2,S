based

old code
| and the new code, then this is acceptable. However, if there are
changes to
| GPL'd source code files, then those changes need to be given to anyone who
| receives binaries from those source code files. In that case, no line
can be

if that's the case, isn't it necessary to distribute the proprietary
parts separately (or vice-versa)? else those proprietary parts would
also be under the GPL.
