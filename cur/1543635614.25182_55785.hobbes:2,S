Alan Cox suggested that I forward this message here and attach the
testcase.  For clarification, `hercules' is an ibm mainframe emulator
-- yes, I know how that sounds, but ac himself has been rumoured to
use it.  Warning, if you are able to recreate the error using the
testcase then you may have to reboot.  I have only recreated the
problem on ia32.
Symptom is *very* slow response time for ftruncate() after fsync()
and ftruncate() have already been issued previously for the file,
if the file is large (hundreds or thousands of megabytes).
Many thanks,
Greg Smith
