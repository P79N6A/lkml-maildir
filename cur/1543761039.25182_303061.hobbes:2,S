That's being fixed, the new semantics will allow a wrapper.

mv ps ps.bin     # -+ or just ln -s /usr/bin/us1 ~admin/bin/ps instead
ln -s su1 ps     # /
echo $'\nask never\nalias ps /bin/ps\nallow admin prefix ps' >> /etc/su1.priv
# ore use * instead of admin, if all users are supposed to see everyone.
Or use the sysctl I described. It won't hurt more than the originally 
suggested flag, and it's much more powerfull.

Is sudo _that_ bad? Seems it was a good decision to avoid sudo.

UNIX and linux are supposed to be a multi-user-systems unlike Win98.
Information leakage is usurally considered {\HUGE BAD}, and some security 
models demand closing all information leakages from privileged users to 
less privileged users. Restricted proc is one more step towards secure 
systems, unless you're depending on "peer review".

Using another PC will hide the processes. Therefore using another PC is 
like using a rootkit. NOT.
Maybe you'll want to print a note about inaccessible proc entries, but 
that's a different issue.

Information leakage is a security aspect.

May. That's why I suggested the min/max sysctl.

With anti-social behavior comes the admin and his LART.
BTW: If the users want to be anti-social, they'll just rename setiathome 
to something like -bash or soffice.

If you like wasting space and energy. If the user's demands don't exceed 
one percent of a historic PC, there is no point in buying more hardware.

Like that:?
$ netstat
Active Internet connections (w/o servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
/proc/net/tcp: Permission denied

They are as broken as finger or ls are if the home directory is chmodded.
