I'm wondering about that too; but it's hard to communicate about threads
between people who know only about the Linux clone() model (i.e. me:),
and who wants something other unspecified thing; it makes me think
wanting that "other" thing is simply just a byproduct of not knowing
"our" model well enough.  But of course, I'm not into threads anyway,
and want to purge away my ignorancy :)
To recap:

multiple processes sharing the same VM are exactly the most light-weight
possible (_LW_P), because there isn't (or shouldn't) be MM-specific cost
between switching them (flushing TLB's, MMU contexts, etc), since they
share the same VM.  So, what's the problem apart from not sharing the
PID (which I don't really care about)?  That the kernel switches the
other CPU context too (i.e.  registers)?  Or why is it different from
that other something which is so important? :)
