sysfs_work_struct is too generic; other parts of sysfs might also want to
use workqueues for different purposes.
I don't like calling it "delayed"-anything, because the operations aren't
necessarily delayed!  On an SMP system they might even execute before the
sysfs_access_in_other_task() call returns.  (Although the two examples we
have so far can't do that because of lock contention.)
The major feature added here is that the work takes place in a different 
task's context, not that it is delayed.  Hence the choice of names.
