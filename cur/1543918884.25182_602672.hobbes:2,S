The few times I've tried to NAK something outright, I've always tried to attach
plenty of technical explanation (usually of the form "Gaak, this oopses my
laptop") :), and cc: the relevant important_name, and hope they listen.
Fortunately, most of the time I can get away with a politely phrased variation of
"important_name would probably appreciate if you fixed XYZ and resubmitted"
comment.. ;)
