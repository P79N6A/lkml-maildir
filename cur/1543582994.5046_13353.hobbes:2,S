Free/Alloc gives the mm the chance to throttle it by failing, and also to 
recover from fragmentation by packing the slabs. If you don't do it you need
to add a hook somewhere that gets triggered on low memory situations and 
frees the buffers.

It doesn't need any hardware support. In fact it is especially helpful for 
the tulip. The idea is that instead of copying the whole packet to get an
aligned header (e.g. on the alpha or other boxes where unaligned accesses
are very expensive) you just copy the first 128 byte that probably contain 
the header. For the data it doesn't matter much if it's unaligned; copy_to_user
and csum_copy_to_user can deal with that fine.
