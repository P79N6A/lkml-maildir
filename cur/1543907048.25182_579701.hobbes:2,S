I would expect the block size to be set once per card, and never be
changed and thus it's not logically a per-transfer operation.  We
certainly wouldn't want to change the block size willy-nilly as it's an
expensive operation.
The patch I've presented does put the selection of the block size in the
core (bar one thing which I agree should be removed).

I consider it unlikely that any card would want to do anything other
than always use the largest possible block size.
