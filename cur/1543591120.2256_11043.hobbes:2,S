I absolutely agree with you. This is the way I always think of devices.

   I agree. It gets worse when we consider multiple bus and NUMA machines.
On a NUMA system you have to ask yourself how should a piece of hardware
look from the node it is on and from another node. Should they look the
same. Then their is the visiblity issue. Which node can see this piece of
hardware? Some devices span several nodes, some only one node. Then on
some NUMA systems you can setup "raid" like systems. If one peice of
hardware fails on a node then another piece of hardware on some other node 
that was caching the hardware state of the hardware that just falied takes
over. Then we have the famous ISA devices in multiple PCI bus systems.
NUMA systems with nodes that multiple buses would just compound the
problem.
