Subject: signal handlers not linked properly in do_fork()?

I've been looking at the code for do_fork() / copy_sighand() and am
mystified by the following.  It seems that copy_sighand() only sets the
new task's sig member if it is not CLONEd from the parent.  
If the signal_struct is CLONEd from the parent, it increments the parent's
signal_struct's reference count, but does not set the new task's sig
member.  I see nowhere else in do_fork() where sig is set, either.  
What gives?
