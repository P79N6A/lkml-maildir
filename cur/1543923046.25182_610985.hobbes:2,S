I think there's a mixup in the flag name there, but I actually would 
recommend against any flag to effect Choice A.  It's simply going to be 
too complex to describe and is going to be a headache to code and support.  
The MPOL_PREFERRED behavior when constrained by cpusets was previously, to 
my knowledge, undocumented; you're in the position to make the behavior do 
what you want it to do and then release documentation so we'll finally 
have a complete and unambiguous API for it.  Right now it should be 
considered undefined and thus you are free to implement it as you choose.  
Then all callers of set_mempolicy(MPOL_PREFERRED) will standardize on that 
and not have to worry about the machine's 
mpol_preferred_relative_to_cpuset setting.
Then, any task that is attached to a cpuset and expecting the fourth node 
in their set_mempolicy(MPOL_PREFERRED) call to mean system node 3 if 
it's in the cpuset's mems_allowed will be broken.  If you want that, 
you'll need your task to be attached to a cpuset with at least mems 0-3; 
programmers will pick that up quickly enough if it's clearly documented.
I think Choice B is correct and makes more sense in terms of the semantics 
and at least allows mempolicies and cpusets to play nicely together 
without a bidirectional dependency on one another.
