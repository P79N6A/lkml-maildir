   BTW I just looked through the patch and I only found a single cast, so
   there was not much need for such dumb casts. Your patch now forced the
   cast into all of them...
The cast in the new version is not dumb, it's smart.
It's the programmer saying (to both the reader of the
code and the compiler) "I want this comparison to use
type X".  Period.
There is no ambiguity, there are no multiple-evaluation
issues, and no dumb warnings from the compiler.
