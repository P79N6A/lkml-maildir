I think the point he's tryin' to make is somewhere else than that. There 
are lots of companies running embedded devices (oh yes, I can tell ;-), 
and as long as it is a) not clear and/or b) impossible by license to use 
real time linux w/their licenses, they won't.
Embedded and real time devices are "The Future" for lots of companies. And 
of course they're going to want to sell it. Currently, they have three 
ways:
1. They try RTAI and don't have any licensing problems, but they are very 
   unsure about it, since certain people keep telling that RTAI is crap
2. They get used to RTLinux, where they are altogether forced to use 
   either GPL or their license. This isn't exactly a way of choice.
3. They go buy another real time os implementation.
Most will decide for 3., since it's the easy and virtually obvious way. 
Thus, Linux isn't going to get very far in respect to embedded devices. I 
suppose _THAT'S_ the point he was trying to make.
Regards,
Thunder
