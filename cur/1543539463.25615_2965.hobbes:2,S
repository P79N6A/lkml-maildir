I'd guess smartd and hdparm. They can be changed to use specific HDIO
ioctls for their stuff. And, yes, I agree with that it should
either stay or go, and that checking the commands is the only wrong way.
Unfortunately /dev/port access doesn't allow the needed locking so for
more features more kernel IOCTLs will be needed. Guess that isn't that
big a problem.
