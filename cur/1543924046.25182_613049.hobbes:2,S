Good....

Obviously. Any ideas how?
I can probably calculate the size based on the number of online nodes when 
the per cpu areas are setup. But the setup is done before we even parse 
command line arguments. That would still mean a fixed size after bootup.
In order to make it truly dynamic we would have to virtually map the area. 
vmap? But that reduces performance.
