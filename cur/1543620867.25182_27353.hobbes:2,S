For What It's Worth, on a laptop environment (where I work quite a
bit) and for something the size of the Linux kernel, and where things
change at the speed of the Linux kernel, in fact space efficiency
matters a lot.
In fact, the one thing for which I was quite unhappy with BK until
Larry implemented bk lclone (aka bk clone -l) was the amount of space
having multiple copies of the same repository took up, since BK really
requires multiple sandboxes for parallel development.  It's not a big
deal with something the size of e2fsprogs, but for something the size
of the BK linux tree, Size Really Matters.
