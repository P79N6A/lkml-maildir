Omni is a small ieee1394 device. This is much bigger phantom premium pci
version:

I used the userspace libs that worked on 2.4 linux and rewrote them a little
bit. However this is the old way, obsoleted I think, but it's still used in
our human-computer interaction lab.
The other one is through supported OpenHaptics suite, which was added in
this version -- that is the original Sensable (the device manufacturer)
product, but they provide 2.4 linux drivers only with it.

Huh, wonders how this got there, thanks!

Yes, starving at sys_close, I think so.
<fast searching in drivers/*>
Wouldn't this be a problem here too:
drivers/media/dvb/cinergyT2/cinergyT2.c
drivers/usb/misc/auerswald.c
at least that the device won't be stopped or something like that?

I'm afraid I didn't get this. It goes through all phantom_devices and
returns first free index. If a hole is present it will return "i" which
corresponds to the hole, because phantom_devices[i] is 0. Note that it is
unsigned char array.
thanks for the clues,
