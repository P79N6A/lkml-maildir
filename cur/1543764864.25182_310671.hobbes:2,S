Aiyeeh - good ole Mozilla tends to reformat things when inlining...

I'm already using cipher block chaining, look for CRYPTO_TFM_MODE_CBC in
swsusp.c. You may want to have a look at cbc_process in crypto/cipher.c.
Thus using the same key is ok. The only known drawback is a watermarking
"attack" but this can only used to look for the existence of specially
crafted files which are not stored on disk during software suspend.
I should, however, use crypto_cipher_en/decrypt instead of
crypto_cipher_en/decrypt_iv as I actually wanted to use the iv in the
tfm I did set up with crypto_cipher_set_iv instead of the local copy.
Going to fix that.
