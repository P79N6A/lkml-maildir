also we can remove some NODE_DATA(0) assumpation on free_bootmem path.

please check following...

with numa enabled, some caller could have range on one node but try to
free that on other node.
that could cause some pages is freed wrongly.
For example: when we try to allocate 128g boot ram early for
gart/swiotlb, and free that range later so gart/swiotlb could get some
range afterwards. then with this patch, we don't need to care which
node is the range, just loop to call free_bootmem_node for all online
nodes.
this patch make free_bootmem_core more robust by trim the sidx and
eidx according the ram range that
node have.
