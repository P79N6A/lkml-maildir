That's exactly the point I'm trying to get across; the 2.6 dev model tries to 
be two cycles in one, dev and stable, which yields an awkward catch22 
situation.
The only sane way forward in such a situation is to realize the mistake and 
return to the focused dev-only / stable-only model.
This would probably involve pushing the current 2.6 kernel into 2.8 and 
starting 2.9 as a dev-cycle only, once 2.8 has structurally stabilized.
Thanks!
