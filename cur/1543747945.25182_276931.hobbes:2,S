Please try 2.6.10-rc3, which includes this set of patches.
Yes, this set of patches includes most of what was in -mm, but not
everything.  Note also, that it includes some more recent patches,
including a poweroff fix, that was not in the -mm patches above.
If your system still fails I'll be very interested to figure out exactly
what we did to make it stop working.
