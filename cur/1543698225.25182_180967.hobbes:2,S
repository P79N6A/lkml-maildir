I have a HP LaserJet 1300 that I'm using over USB.
(drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: USB Bidirectional printer dev 8 if 0 alt 1 proto 2 vid 0x03F0 pid 0x1017)
What's getting to be very annoying is that usually within a day after
printing something, I get the message usb 1-2: control timeout on
ep0in, and the printer needs to be power cycled. I get other weird
errors sometimes, like "drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: error -110
reading printer status". I don't have any evidence that this is
Linux's fault, but it seems like a fairly likely possibility, at least
if you consider it an incompatibility with the printer rather than a bug.
My mouse uses USB and it works fine. I'm using an expensive Belkin
USB cable. The kernel version is 2.6.0-test9-bk17. Here is some
information on my USB controller:
00:11.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB (rev 23) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
        Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc. (Wrong ID) USB Controller
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 10
        I/O ports at c800 [size=32]
        Capabilities: <available only to root>
I think this may have started a few -test revisions ago, but I'm not
sure. I only purchased the printer fairly recently so it's not like I
can say that it's worked for years.
