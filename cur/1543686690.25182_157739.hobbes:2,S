Intel shows no inclination to release Centrino wireless drivers for
Linux.  There have been vague insinuations that this is due to excessive
software controllability, but no public explanations have been given,
beyond "we're not doing it at this moment".
If you want built-in wireless in the nearish term, you'll have to get a
supported MiniPCI card and replace your Centrino card.
As far as CPU is concerned, if you're using recent 2.5 or 2.6 kernels,
there's Pentium M support in cpufreq.  Jeremy Fitzhardinge has written a
userspace daemon that varies the Pentium M CPU frequency in response to
load.
