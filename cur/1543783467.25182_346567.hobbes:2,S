ndiswrapper and driverloader will not work reliably with 4k stacks.
This is because of the Windoze drivers they use, to which, obviously,
they do not have the source. Since quite a few laptops have built-in
wireless cards by companies who will not release an open-source driver,
or won't release specs, ndiswrapper and driverloader are the only way
to get these cards to work. 
  Please don't tell me to "get a linux-supported wireless card". I don't
want the clutter of an external wireless adapter sticking out of my laptop,
nor do I want to spend money on a card when I have a free and working solution.
Thank you.
