Can you suggest a test to do this ? I can't think of anything other
than manually flushing the route cache.

Yes. With RCU, the write-side doesn't affect the performance
of the read-side. However, there is the additional overhead
of calling call_rcu() and queueing up of the RCU callback
for every dst entry that is freed. The other aspect is of
latency, how quickly the deferred rcu callbacks are invoked.
We have done some studies in this regard under various
degrees of workloads. I will put up the graphs in lse. They
will also be presented at OLS2002.

A heavily loaded webserver with NATed ip addresses. Would this not
result in many server processes looking up the same ip address ?
Thanks
