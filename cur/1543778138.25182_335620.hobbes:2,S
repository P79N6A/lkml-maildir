I will give it a try.

You got it! As a laptop user, I think it just takes too much more. I 
think it is maybe hotplugs fault with the kernel? I don't know how much 
is done by the kernel or userspace but it definitely takes longer.
I could do some sort of benchmarks, but believe me, I hate to say this, 
but I use 2.6 because of much more power managements features in it. 
Else I like 2.4 a lot more. Is like, the feels is sharper. Sometimes 
when I got into a tty1, it takes some time after I put my username in to 
prompt me for a password. This does not occur when I boot with 2.4.27. 
Strange huh?
I don't want to be an ass and say that 2.4 is better, instead I want to 
help and let determine why is it that I feel 2.6 slower.
