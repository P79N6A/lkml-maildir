What if you instead forward-ported same cleanups to swsusp? If done in
reasonably-sized chunks, it would be very welcome.
Of course, having maintained pmdisk in kernel is *way* better than
having umaintained pmdisk in kernel. So feel free to add yourself an
entry in MAINTAINERS file...
Alternatively if you bring pmdisk up-to-date (and maintain it), I
might as well kill swsusp. But I like the name (SWap SUSPend) slightly
better than pmdisk... :-).
