Well, kORBit itself is bigger than kNFS, but like Chris said, it can
do much more. :)
For testing kORBit we wrote a new filesystem CorbaFS.  The CorbaFS
client is a kernel module that basically forwards the Linux VFS calls
to the userspace CorbaFS server.
According to lsmod, the CorbaFS module takes up only 11KB of RAM.
Keep in mind that CorbaFS is currently only a proof-of-concept of the
kernel calling into userspace through kORBit (it is a read-only
filesystem at the moment, for example).  But it should give you some
idea.
The cool thing is that the CorbaFS userspace server can implement any
kind of filesystem you want, as long as it follows the CorbaFS
interface!  The current implementation exports the filesystem on the
host machine that it is running on, similar to NFS.  But we also have
ideas for FTP or web filesystems, for example.  Imagine being able to
mount the web CorbaFS onto /mnt/www and do a
  cat /mnt/www/www.kernel.org/index.html
and the CorbaFS userspace server takes care of loading the webpage and
returning it to the kernel client.  And these new filesystems don't
take up any extra space in the kernel, since they all talk to the same
CorbaFS kernel module!  Not to mention being able to implement the
filesystem in any language you like, debug the implementation in
userspace, etc.
