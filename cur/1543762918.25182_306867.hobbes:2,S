That's not uncommon.  I don't ask people "are you reading the mailing list
which you should be reading" unless I think it's someone who doesn't read
the mailing lists which they should be reading.

In this case I didn't think about it very hard, sorry - figured it was s390
stuff and it hence falls under the "if it breaks, it's the s390 team's
problem" exemption.

True.  But it's not as if we can't fix stuff up after it's merged up.  The
reasons for holding off on a merge would be:
a) We're not sure that the feature should be merged at all
b) Holding off on a merge is a tool we use to motivate the submitter to
   fix the code up
c) The merge breaks existing stuff.
I don't think any of those things apply here.  The only downside is the
increased bk patch volume.
That being said, if there had been review comments I would have delayed the
merge.
