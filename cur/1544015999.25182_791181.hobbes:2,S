I added to the To/Cc list.
Thank you for your time to giving me valuable comments on this topic.

OK.

OK, this is not an exact documentation, rather a question. My goal is to find
out from the people what they *think* this function shall work and not how the
actual code works.
In case of testing it is essential what is the base of my test case. If I based
my test case on the source code I would test whether the compiler produces
good code or not. But my goal is different: to find out whether the function
works as the developers expect to work. If I try to find out this I can gain
that I can found possible differences between the code and the developer's
expectation.
My next version looks as follows. I still would like to find out what do
you *think* shall happen if the caller specifies a name which was already occupied
before:
