Well, two. Or three. 
- Hey, IP x changed from mac X to mac Y. 
- Hey, IP x changed back again to X. 
- Hmm. IP X seems to be using both Mac X and and Mac Y. 
	No further warnings will be issued about this. 
If someone is taking over an IP address (which is especially what
arpwatch should be looking for), this is exactly what you'll see. Having
the issue be ignored after one warning is bad. 
Oh, and I know people who swear that this would be an invalid
configuration, so that it is good for arpwatch to should loud and
clear about it...
