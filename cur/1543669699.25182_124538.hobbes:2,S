I attempted posting this to the alsa mailing lists, but I'm not subscribed,
and I think it's waiting for moderator approval. In any case, ALSA being part 
of the kernel, here's my bug report:
This is using the driver from alsa-project on a 2.4 kernel (details below):
============================================================
I'd like to confirm a bug report (follows) on my system:
The System:
        Gigabyte GVAXP-Ultra with onboard RealTek ALC650 soundcard.
        Altec Lansing 251 5.1 surround speaker system (analog)
        Kernel: 2.4.21-pre5-ac3
        Alsa: 0.9.2

The Problem:
        My speakers have a switch between 2/4 channels and 6 channels.
        When in 6-channel mode, nothing will play on the center and rear 
speakers, unless I enable Duplicate Front. When in 4 channel mode, all 
speakers play. Apparently, multichannel output isn't working.
Note: I have unmuted almost everything, including
CENTER, SURROUND, LFE....
Additional info:
        I think I compiled with debug on, but I'm not sure anymore.
        I get these messages:
ALSA ../alsa-kernel/pci/via82xx.c:675: invalid via82xx_cur_ptr, using last
valid pointer
ALSA ../alsa-kernel/pci/via82xx.c:675: invalid via82xx_cur_ptr, using last
valid pointer
