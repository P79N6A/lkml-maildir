Guys, in recent kernels, when building kernel with initramfs with V=1, 
i  see interesting one:
cat /usr/kernel/BE/2_6/initramfs/init.sh >/usr/kernel/BE/2_6/initramfs/init
But i can't find, who really do that. Can anyone point me?
I need to fix that, because it's impossible for me to have two copy of init.
Thanks.
