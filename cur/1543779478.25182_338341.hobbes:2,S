Most laptops (including mine, a Thinkpad T40) use a PS/2 mouse.  So in
the places where power consumption savins matters most, it's usually
quite possible to function without needing any USB devices.  The 90%
figure isn't at all right; in fact, it may be that over 90% of the
laptops still use PS/2 mice and keyboards.
