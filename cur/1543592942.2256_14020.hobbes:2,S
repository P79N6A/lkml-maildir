That's correct, I only submitted it for inclusion into the kernel, so
it's not yet there. Just patch your kernel source with my patch, run
"make psdocs" and you'll have it in your kernel tree as well.
However, because we got a similar procfs question on the kernelnewbies
list, I already put the html and pdf versions online on the
kernelnewbies documentation pages:

PS: Was it really necessary to quote my complete message *including*
    the patch? Next time quote properly before you post.
