Also, a task could be preempted and then rescheduled on the same cpu
making
the depth counter 0 (right ?), but it could still be holding references
to data
structures to be updated using synchronize_kernel(). There seems to be
two
approaches to tackle preemption -
1. Disable pre-emption during the time when references to data
structures 
updated using such Two-phase updates are held.
Pros: easy to implement using a flag (ctx_sw_off() ?)
Cons: not so easy to use since critical sections need to be clearly
identified and interfaces defined. also affects preemptive behavior.
2. In synchronize_kernel(), distinguish between "natural" and preemptive
schedules() and ignore preemptive ones.
Pros: easy to use
Cons: Not so easy to implement. Also a low priority task that keeps
getting
preempted often can affect update side performance significantly.
I intend to experiment with both to understand the impact.
Thanks
