This is funny. I do remember this bug was discussed a couple of years ago,
and the conclusion was "we can fix it later" :)

I think we can make a simpler patch,
--- posix-timers.c~	2007-06-29 14:45:04.000000000 +0400
+++ posix-timers.c	2007-07-17 16:59:45.000000000 +0400
@@ -449,6 +449,9 @@ static void release_posix_timer(struct k

+
 	sigqueue_free(tmr->sigq);
 	if (unlikely(tmr->it_process) &&
 	    tmr->it_sigev_notify == (SIGEV_SIGNAL|SIGEV_THREAD_ID))
What do you think? Instead of complicating the lock_timer(), release_posix_timer()
just makes sure that nobody can "use" tmr.
(Actually, I am not sure this is my idea, perhaps something like above was suggested
 by somebody else, I forgot the discussion completely).
