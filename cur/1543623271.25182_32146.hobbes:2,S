	Heyla folks.  I hit a snag while using 2.4.18 for the first
time the other day.... When I played DVDs under it, there would be a
large amount of 'skips' in comparison to 2.4.17.  I know, not much of a
bug report, as I think the bug may have already been addressed.
	The reason I say this is that my DVD-ROM drive is on the
secondary IDE channel of a PIIX4 chipset.  Under 2.4.17 playback
preformance is nearly perfect.  Could these "PIIX4 slave timing" fixes
that I've been reading about in a few of the newer changelogs be what
I'm looking for?  I'm going to track down one of the newer patches
(probably -pre2-ac1) and try it out and see if that gives better
preformance for me.
