Thank you.  This is exactly why in the last CONFIG_TINY thread I made
it clear that a one-size-fits-all option is not all that helpful for
serious embedded systems designers.
Collecting these parameters in a single tweaks.h file and perhaps using
things like CONFIG_TINY, CONFIG_DESKTOP, CONFIG_FOO as profile selectors
into tweaks.h would be a lot more effective.  His collection of
(hopefully) size-optimizing tweaks can all be selected via CONFIG_TINY,
but have them collected at a single point like tweaks.h such that they
can be individually modified by an end system integrator.
