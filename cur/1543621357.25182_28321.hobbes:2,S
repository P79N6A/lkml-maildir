Well, I've mentioned this at least three times, Pete Zaitcev has a patch
which fixes i810_audio properly -- and he even posted it to lkml less
than 24 hours ago.  Subject "Re: 2.5.5-pre1 and i810_audio.c",
message-id <200202141842.g1EIgcR12566@devserv.devel.redhat.com>
Further, Alan Cox pointed out that the i810_audio workalike chipsets
exist on Alpha, so your solution is still non-portable specifically for
case where portability is needed.
