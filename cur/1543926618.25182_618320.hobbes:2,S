When the ARCH=x86 build is documented, some words about
cross-compilation should be added:
  (1) To compile a 32-bit kernel on a 64-bit system you have to
  Disable 64bit support in menuconfig (config, oldconfig etc.).  A
  subsequent kernel compile will build a 32-bit kernel.  No cross
  compiler is needed.
  (2) To compile a 64-bit kernel on a 32-bit system you have to switch
  on 64-bit support in menuconfig (or config, oldconfig, etc.).  For
  the subsequent kernel compile a cross compiler (supporting 64-bit)
  is needed. You have to use a command line like
        # make CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-
  to cross compile your kernel.

Andreas
