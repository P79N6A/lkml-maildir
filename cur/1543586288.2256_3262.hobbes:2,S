Hi all,
we're trying to get a Cool Road Runner board by Lippert (see 
http://www.emjembedded.com/products/single/coolroadr.html
)
to run under Linux (SuSE 6.4, kernel 2.2.14).
The CompactFlash disk (a 32 MB SanDisk) is recognized as /dev/hda,
but the system fails to see the /dev/hdb disk (an IBM DARA-206000
jumpered as slave). When the IDE driver loads, it displays 
hda:pio, hdb:DMA - and yes, the BIOS assigns UDMA33 to the slave drive
while the master is detected as Mode1.
The IDE controller is a CS5530.
Is there a chance that a newer kernel will detect the second disk?
If I disconnect the slave drive, I can see "hdb:pio" :-((( but not
the drive, of course B-)
Any ideas?
Steffen
