if the machine is on, and you can get close to it, it's probably easier
just to use tempest radiation.  it will also work at a distance, so it's
more likely to be a threat than grabbing RAM chips.  a few points:
1.  not everyone is going to bring their James Bond RAM Reader (tm) into
your building to extract data.  a hardcore data thief, maybe, but it's not
common equipment.  everyone will have access to an IDE or SCSI disk
reader.
2.  RAM has a short window of oppurtunity.  whatever it turns out to be,
RAM degrades faster than disk.  it's not going to last while you drive it
home, unless you have a RAM refresher plugged in the cigarette lighter.
3.  encrypted swap is meant for a different threat model.  you assume that
the attacker might have access to the box at night or over a weekend,
while you're away.  RAM will be off.  if you think someone might be trying
to steal your RAM, you need better physical security.
