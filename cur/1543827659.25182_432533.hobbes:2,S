  Indeed, that would be preferable but might get tricky.

  I effectively meant using a PI futex for the cv __data.__futex but now
I realize it's a Really Bad Idea.
  To summarize (correct me if I'm wrong), we need a way in the broadcast
case to promote the cv __data.__futex type to the type of the external
mutex (PI, PP, normal) in the requeue path. Therefore we need the
ability to requeue waiters on a regular futex onto a PI futex.
  Ingo, Thomas, is this feasible?
  Sébastien.
