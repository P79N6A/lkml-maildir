I have not used initramfs at all (I am not sure I know what it is 
actually) so I don't know. I know there is quite a long period of time on 
most machines from when the kernel starts booting and when the real file 
system based init process takes over.

I am pretty sure most embedded systems use some kind of boot firmware to 
bring up the box. Something like Open BIOS from IBM or U-Boot. U-Boot can 
be set up to POST the card using the BIOS emulator but Open BIOS cannot. 
If you don't POST the card in the boot loader, usually they display 
diagnostics on the serial port until the console comes up (ie: I see the 
'uncompress linux...' message on the serial port and then the framebuffer 
console comes up and the messages switch over to it.

True. On the Mac they use the speakers so the user knows that the machine 
is booting. Almost immediately after hitting the power you will hear a 
calming sound coming from the speaker, and it might be another 5 seconds 
or so before the actual video comes up. 
If they didn't do that they would no doubt have lots of users turning the 
machine off again before it had a chance to bring up the video!
