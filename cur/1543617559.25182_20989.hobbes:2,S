And yet, I see the greatest potential for initramfs coming from devices  that 
*don't* boot from a hard drive.  I know tons of embedded devices that have 
very evil looking init scripts just to boot something other than a hard 
drive.  Man, if the initramfs could handle all those cases uniformly, it 
would be a huge advantage for the embedded world.
