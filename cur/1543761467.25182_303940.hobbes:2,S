there's one detail on PREEMPT_RT though (which i think you noticed too). 
Priority inheritance handling can be done in a pretty straightforward
way as long as no true read-side nesting is allowed for rwsems and
rwlocks - i.e. there's only one owner of a lock at a time. So PREEMPT_RT
restricts rwsem and rwlock concurrency: readers are writers, with the
only exception that they are allowed to 'self-nest'. I.e. things like:
	read_lock(&rwlock);
	...
		read_lock(&rwlock);
are still legal. (it's also done quite often.)
(it is virtually impossible to implement priority inheritance for true
multi-reader locks in any sane way: i've done it initially and it sucks
very much. It also fundamentally increases the 'lock-dependent'
worst-case latencies - imagine 4 readers having to finish first if a
higher-prio writer comes along. It's insane.)
