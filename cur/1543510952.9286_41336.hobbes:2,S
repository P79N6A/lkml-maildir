I read that thread and I was very surprised that scan.c apeared in kernel...

Yes. Alan recommended to use mem_start in private post; unfortunately,
at least tulip uses mem_start for something other :-( If it was not exported
to userspace...

I found it. Current code registers region as 'eth0'. You know that
this is 'eth0' after init_etherdev... We can register_region AFTER
initialization returns (with desired name), but it is not raceless solution.

So another helper. Ok.

I added flags PCI_PROBE_PHYSICAL and PCI_REGISTER_RESOURCE into pci_id_info
struct and converted tulip.c to all four formats. Shortest code came,
as expected, if probe gets virtual address and device is registered by
scanning code. Unfortunately, if you want support ifconfig, driver
must determine physical address through strange code quoted above.
And you cannot register device under name "eth0".
  To be 100% correct, we should probably use base_addr field when doing
I/O and mem_start/end when doing MMIO. Otherwise ifconfig prints only
low four digits of address; and it is a bit useless on most configurations.
  I'll publish some code later today.
