Yep. That's what I tried to do. Just returns 0 and continues to
contain all the cached data.

Goes to the end plus offset. A subsequent read returns EOF
or 0 depending upon your read mechanism. This is what I wanted
to do but with no offset.
Currently, I do this crap:
     for(;;)
     {
         pfd.fd      = ifd;
         pfd.events  = POLLIN;
         pfd.revents = 0;
         if(poll(&pfd, 1, 0) <= 0)
             break;
         (void)read(ifd, ibuf, BUF_LEN);
     }
I should be able to just lseek(ifd, 0 SEEK_END);
