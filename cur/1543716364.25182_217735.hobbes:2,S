Hi,
I just returned from my vacation and checked my emails. That's why the 
response is so late.

1) FIXME: Does "no array defined" correspond to HPT_T_SINGLEDISK?
I have to check this but I believe it is so.
2) FIXME: Is HPT_T_RAID_01_RAID_1 a value that can ever be found?
I think this is the new style raid-10 format that is supported by hpt374 
and upwards. I do not have such a controller so I cannot verify this.
3) FIXME: what does HPT_MAGIC_BAD mean?
You get this if you pull one disk out of a raid-0 array for example. The 
HPT-BIOS detects that the raid is not operational and marks the array as 
bad (writes the HPT_MAGIC_BAD to the remaining disks).

I have not found any crc or so. But since HPT marks any disks that is 
not in an array as HPT_T_SINGLEDISK or HPT_MAGIC_BAD we should be fine 
unless someone writes some garbage to the superblock.

The HPT copyrights look fine.
I am looking forward to see the part that writes the dm configuration so 
that I can integrate it into the evms plugin.

PS: add_disk_to_raidlists() does never return retval!
