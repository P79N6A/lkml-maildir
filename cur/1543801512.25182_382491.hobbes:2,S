IA64 defines two qualifiers for cmpxchg, specifically for
distinguishing between acquiring and releasing the lock.
  cmpxchg<sz>.<sem>
<sz> is the data size, 1, 2, 4 or 8.  <sem> is one of 'acq' or 'rel'.
  sem       Ordering    Semaphore Operation
Completer   Semantics
  acq        Acquire    The memory read/write is made visible prior to
                        all subsequent data memory accesses.
  rel        Release    The memory read/write is made visible after all
                        previous data memory accesses.
cmpxchg4.acq prevents following data accesses from migrating before
taking the lock (critical R/W cannot precede critical-START).
cmpxchg4.rel prevents preceding data accesses from migrating after
releasing the lock (critical R/W cannot follow critical-END).  I
suggest adding acq and rel hints to atomic_xchg, and let architectures
that implement suitable operations use those hints.
