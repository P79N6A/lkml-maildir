And different .config files results in different kernels.
Please note that .config files are also located in OBJTREE.
Cosider something like the following:
~/bk/linux-2.5
~/compile/arm	  <= Used to check that the kernel compiles for ARM
~/compile/allmod  <= My config with a lot of modules
~/compile/machine <= The config I use on my machine
~/compile/work    <= That's my sandbox
All configurations share the same src.
During the last copule of days we have seen some header file
clean-ups. It would have been nice if they tried compiling in
all four configurations listed above.
But if I switch .config then it is often a recompile of everything,
whereas the above setup can minimize it.
The header file cleanup is maybe not the best example because touching
a few key header files requires recompilation of everything anyway.
But my point is that there is a good use of different configurations
based on the same src.
Others that have asked for separate obj dir may step in here,
explaining why they thougt it was good.
