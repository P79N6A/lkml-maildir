I apologize ahead of time if I just need to RTFM, all I ask is that
someone point me in the right direction:
I'm running into general protection faults and I would appreciate some
help in diagnosing the problem.  I'm running 2.0.36 on two machines: a
Dell Poweredge and a VA Research, both SMP.  The trigger is a
multithreaded application that does tons of network IO (hundreds of
simultaneous connections by different threads).  I'm getting the
following syslog messages (five or six in a couple seconds):

At one point the VA Reseach machine appeared to be leaking process
descriptors, to the point where I maxed out with only seventy processes
running.  Similar for file descriptors.  To get the machine back into a
sane state I had to reboot.
My questions are:
1. Where can I go for information on deciphering this data to either
solve the problem myself (or at least understand the cause), or
provide smarter people with enough information to be able to quickly
and painlessly understand what is going on?
This may sound naive, but I read oops-tracing.txt but the document
didn't seem to be distributed with 2.0.36 so I wanted to insure that I
had the right information for diagnosing 2.0.
Thanks in advance for any advice.
