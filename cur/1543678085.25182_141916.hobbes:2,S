The license to which you referred says, in part:
Copyright(C) Caldera International Inc. 2001-2002. All rights
reserved.

modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are
met:

copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following
disclaimer. [. . .]
The file in question in the Kernel does not include any Caldera
copyright notice, and in fact claims that the copyright belongs to
SGI.  Isn't that a violation of Caldera's copyright?  
Of course, if SGI has an unlimited right to relicense Unix code as its
own, it's not an issue.
