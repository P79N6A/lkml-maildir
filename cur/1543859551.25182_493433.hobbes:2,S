Note that this is referring to different pages.

afaict the code copes with those things.

These are different pages.
We could view the copy_highpage() in migrate_page_copy() as an "io"
operation, only the backing store is a new pagecache page.
It'd be more logical if that copy_highpage() was occurring after the
clear_page_dirty_for_io().
I'm not sure why migrate_page_copy() is playing with
PageWriteback(newpage).  Surely newpage is locked, in which case nobody
will be starting writeback on it.

That is how it's presently implemented.  You're looking at helper functions
which fileystems may point their address_space_operations.migratepage at.

The dirty state is being transferred to the new page.  The tricky part is
handling the cases where these pages are mapped into pagetables.  That's
what the special migration ptes are there for.  I'll let Christoph explain
that lot ;)
