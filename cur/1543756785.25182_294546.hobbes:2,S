Yes. Dammit, especially for something like this, the long-line version is 
just _so_ much more readable. Compare my and your version wrt being able 
to tell what the differences between the four different cases are.
In the single-long-line version, the differences are trivially visible. In 
the "prettified" version (aka "I'm still living in the 60's, and proud of 
it" version), it's impossible to pick out the differences.
If you don't like long lines, use a helper #define for the common part or 
something.
