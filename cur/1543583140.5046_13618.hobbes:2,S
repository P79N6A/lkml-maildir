After building a patched source tree, and running "make xmenu" on a
RH6.2 system with most relevant RPMs installed, I see:
drivers/net/Config.in: 359: bad if condition
The following line:
if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = y -a "$CONFIG_WAN_ROUTER" != "n" ]; then
should be:
if [ "$CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL" = "y" -a "$CONFIG_WAN_ROUTER" != "n" ]; then
