Since NFS was not working (the nfsd processes were already in D state), to 
mount a CIFS share from the very same server (and the same client). I'm 
exporting the same /data share (JFS), but, since it's smbd I don't have to 
export every single submount (as it is with NFS):
* with NFS:
server:/data      (jfs)
server:/data/sub  (xfs)
* with CIFS:
server:/data      (containing both the jfs and the xfs partition as one
                    single share to mount)
Upon accessing the /data/sub part of the CIFS share, the client hung, 
waiting for the server to respond (the [cifs] kernel thread on the client 
was spinning, waiting for i/o). On the server, similar things as with the 
nfsd processes happened (although I know that the smbd (Samba) processes 
are running completely in userspace):

Sysrq-t again on the server:

=======================
So, it's really not NFS but ?FS related?
