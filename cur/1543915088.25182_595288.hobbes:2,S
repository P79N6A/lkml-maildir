Thanks for the update. I have some more comments. And sorry if it looks
like nitpicking, but this is a standard interface we're defining so we
better make sure that we get it right.
First of all, please think of a better subject line for this patch.
"Update Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface" is too vague when your
patch is rather specific.

How useful are historical extremes of an average?

I don't much like this name. It sounds like a name crafted for the
specific feature of a given chip, while we try to use generic names for
the standard interface. I would rather go for power[1-*]_reset_history
if we have a single file for resetting all the extremes of a given
channel, or power[1-*]_input_lowest_reset and
power[1-*]_input_highest_reset if we go for a per-value reset.
Alternatively, we could simply make the power[1-*]_input_lowest and
power[1-*]_input_highest files writable, and "cat power1_input >
power1_input_lowest" (or any write?) would reset the history.
