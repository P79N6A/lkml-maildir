It is only a problem when doing mmap writes. In the case of ordinary
writes, NFS has to do its own tracking of dirty pages, and so it can
ensure that no race exists.
However if the user is doing mmap writes while the file is in the
process of being modified on the server, then they are doing something
wrong anyway. The small race between nfs_sync_mapping() and
invalidate_inode_pages2() is the least of their problems.
