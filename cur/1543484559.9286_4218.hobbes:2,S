Not as such. But as VIDIOCVBISIZE  so its generic to all future VBI setups
maybe. The problem is there are other things that matter
There ought to be a 
	struct vbi_config
	{
		int size;
		int format;
		etc ...
	};
and that wants defining with the whole API carefully and cleanly as a generic
VBI API
