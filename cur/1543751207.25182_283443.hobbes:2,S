That's true, as we discussed a couple of months back.  But the current code
is nice and simple and has been there for a couple of years with no
observed problems.

The caller would need to wait on all the zones which can satisfy the
caller's allocation request.  A bit messy, although not rocket science. 
One would have to be careful to avoid additional CPU consumption due to
delivery of multiple wakeups at each I/O completion.
We should be able to demonstrate that such a change really fixes some
problem though.  Otherwise, why bother?
