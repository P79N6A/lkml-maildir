It's a small change to make the fw_transaction struct opaque and ref-counted, 
and it's definitely still doable.  But the nice thing about embedding the 
struct is that you have one memory allocation failure path less to worry 
about.  And I haven't yet, and don't expect to see a use case that will need 
ref-counted struct fw_transaction, the ownership is always clearly defined. 
But I can go either way on this and if there is a good reason to ref count 
them it's a pretty small change.
cheers,
Kristian
