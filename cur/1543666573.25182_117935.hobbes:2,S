So what happens now?
Is this critical enough for 2.4.21 to go out?  Or can it wait like
some other fairly serious stuff such as the ext3 fixes?  What about
the current state of IDE?
Would it make sense to repackage 2.4.20 into something like 2.4.20-p1
or 2.4.20.1 with only the critical stuff applied?
