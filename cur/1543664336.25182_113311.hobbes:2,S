Well..  This has nothing to do with the current patch..  It should
still be applied..
At any rate..  I don't believe anybody has done this before..  If you
perform the same excercise without the current patch, you should see the
same result..  I don't see many folks doing this, but it should probably
be fixed...  I'll investigate...
