In the 2.2.x patches I didn't changed the ordering algorithm, see:
			const int after_current = IN_ORDER(tmp,req);
			const int before_next = IN_ORDER(req,tmp->next);
			if (!IN_ORDER(tmp,tmp->next)) {
				if (after_current || before_next)
					break;
			} else {
				if (after_current && before_next)
					break;
			}
so it doesn't suffer form that problem. Also the elevator before
test2 didn't sufferred from that problem, see:
-	while ((entry = entry->prev) != head) {
-		if (!point && latency >= 0) {
-			point = entry;
-			point_latency = latency;
-		}
-		tmp = blkdev_entry_to_request(entry);
-		if (elevator_sequence_before(tmp->elevator_sequence, sequence) || !tmp->q)
-			break;
-		if (latency >= 0) {
-			if (IN_ORDER(tmp, req) ||
-			    (pass && !IN_ORDER(tmp, blkdev_next_request(tmp))))
-				goto link;
-		}
-		latency += tmp->nr_segments;
-		pass = 1;
-	}
-
-	if (point) {
-		entry = point;
-		latency = point_latency;
-	}
-
- link:
-	list_add(&req->queue, entry);
-	req->elevator_sequence = elevator_sequence(elevator, latency);
And with the default latency values ("infinite") with the test2 elevator if
you're using scsi as your device, the patch can't make runtime differences
either.
