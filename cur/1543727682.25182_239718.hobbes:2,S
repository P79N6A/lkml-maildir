Probably it is.  Lots of hardware FIFO chips are 4 or 8 bytes wide and
can't do partial transfers (because of the way the cycle the data off
the bus).  Usually they have logic that sends only partial fragments on
to the device for commands, but its not unknown for them to forget this
on actual data transfers

Well...more likely a driver bug.  Residuals have to be reported by the
driver.  I thought all of the drivers that could were now doing this,
but I might have missed some...which driver is it?

I can try:
A selection timeout is reported as DID_NO_CONNECT.
DID_TIME_OUT is for cards that can watchdog their commands in hw and is
what they return when the watchdog fires.
If you actually want visibility into the SCSI mid layer timeout, that's
harder since it feeds directly into the error handler that tries to
ready the transport and device for action.  In general, a command that
times out this way is retried.  If you set the FASTFAIL flag, it will
come out with DRIVER_TIMEOUT set in its result area.

Yes, more details please.  I do a lot of limited testing on 2.6 but the
hardware manufacturers are doing much more.  The general consensus seems
to be that 2.6 is pretty solid at least for FC and SPI.

).
2.6 has just gone out to a wider audience via SLES9.  As is inevitable,
the test cases people have in the field are wider than those we
necessarily have the hw to produce, so it's expected that the arrival
rate for bugs will increase.
The only comparitive metric I have shows me that 2.4 was orders of
magnitude worse at this point (which was earlier: 2.4.2 from redhat).
