Assuming your BIOS isn't totally out-of-date, what happens if you try 
turning off the usb-handoff code and preventing the *hci-hcd.ko drivers 
from loading, as described ealier in this thread?
If your keyboard works in that state, what happens when you disable 
the handoff code and driver for each one of the drivers, alone?
