In reference to the random-stack patch....
Executing the following program on linux-2.6.13.4:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
     int foo;
     printf("%p\n", &foo);
     return 0;
}
... a few thousand times and sorting its output shows
the stack varies from:
 	0xbf7fe144 -> 0xbffff674
Isn't this too much?  I thought the random-stack patch was
only supposed to vary it a page or 64k at most. This looks
like some broken logic because it varies almost 8 megabytes!
No wonder some of my user's database programs sometimes seg-fault
and other times work perfectly fine. I think this is incorrect
and shows a serious bug (misbehavior).
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
