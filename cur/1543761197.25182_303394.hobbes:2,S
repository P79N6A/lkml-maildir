Those two are in the journal, actually.  You refer to jbd_lock_bh_state()
and jbd_lock_bh_journal_head().  I think they both need to be in the
buffer_head.  jbd_lock_bh_journal_head() can probably go away (just use
caller's jbd_lock_bh_state()).
Or make them global, or put them in the journal.

It wouldn't be the end of the world.  I'm not clear on what bits of the
rt-super-low-latency stuff is intended for mainline though?
