I can now start pppd with the demand option, and if I start up a ppp
connection fairly soon afterwards it works fine. In fact I can do 
"ping somewhere" and ppp comes up as expected, then I can hangup redo
"ping somewhere" ppp comes back up -- all good. BUT if I wait a long time
?? ( I don't know how long 4 hours or so ), then try "ping somewhere" I
get nothing. I have pppd dump lots of info to my log files, but it simply
does nothing. It still responds to signals, but not to attempted
connections.
