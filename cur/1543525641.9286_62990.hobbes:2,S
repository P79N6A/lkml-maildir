It does not migrate, it never _was_ on another interfaces.
eth1 and eth2 are simply not used in your configuration.

Seems, the theory is wrong. 8)
Especially for httpd, where received load is next to zero comparing
to output one.

They are by default.

do not attach them to single broadcast wire and use router instead.
If you do not believe, write 1 to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/hidden
