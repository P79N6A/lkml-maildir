Simply skipping the page table setup of MAP_SHARED regions
should be enough to fix this issue.

Filling in all the page table entries at the first fault to
a VMA doesn't make much sense, IMHO.
The reason I think this is that people have experimented
with prefaulting already resident pages at page fault time,
and those experiments have never shown a conclusive benefit.
Now, if doing such prefaulting for normal processes does not
show a benefit - why would it be beneficial to recently forked
processes with a huge SHM area ?
I suspect we would be better off without that extra complexity,
unless there is a demonstrated benefit to it.
