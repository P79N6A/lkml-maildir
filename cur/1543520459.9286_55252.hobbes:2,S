Not at all... It's time to me to move to new kernels in order to be ready to
release next KSI Linux distribution when 2.4 is out so I must get the
kernel running. I'm ready to make any required debugging to get it done.
I'd be very grateful if somebody fix the bug. And I'd be very glad if the
thing could run without hanging more then several hours...
