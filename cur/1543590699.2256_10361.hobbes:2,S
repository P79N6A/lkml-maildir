I coded up a mixture of Andi's 2.2.x apis and Neil's 2.4.x stuff and sent
it out for review a little while ago. It isn't as good as Neil's stuff, but
it doesn't require changing the other filesystems.  If it looked good to
the NFS guys and the other FS guys don't hate it, I'll push it around for
testing/inclusion.
This would be my preferred solution right now, since it could also work for
AFS.
