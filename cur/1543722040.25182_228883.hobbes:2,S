Now I recall why I did not like the object directory.
I will break all modules using the kbuild infrastructure!
Why, because there is no way the to find the output directory except
specifying both directories.
One could do:
make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/source O=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd`
So the currect choice is:
1) Break modules that actually dive into the src, grepping, including or whatever
2) Break all modules using kbuild infrastructure, including the above ones
I go for 1), introducing minimal breakage.
And please keep in mind. The breakage wil _only_ be visible when kernels are
shipped with separate output directory.
If kernels are shipped with no output files at all then one can just
compile the kernel. Seems to be the Fedora way. No breakage happens.
If kernels are shipped with mixed source and output then no breakage happens.
If kernels are shipped with separate source and output then we better break
as few modules as possible. And the introduced change actually minimize breakage.
So the patch will not change.
