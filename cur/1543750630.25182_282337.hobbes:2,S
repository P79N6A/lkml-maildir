Hi,
I want to disable the creation of the core dump even
after set "ulimit -c XXXX"
I modify 
include/asm-i386/resource.h
the data structure INIT_RLIMITS
the 4th elements(RLIMIT_CORE)
from 
rlim_cur = 0, rlim_max = RLIMINFINITY
to 
rlim_cur = 0, rlim_max = 0
But core dump still be created.
Thanks in advance.
gan
