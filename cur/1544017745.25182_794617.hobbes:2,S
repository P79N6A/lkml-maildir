output depends on iter_flags, most of what is needed is there, but I
guess there are too many ways to achieve the same result and some
keywords that are already used for other purposes, such as
TRACE_ITER_BIN -> print_bin_fmt that forces all traces to first have
pid, cpu and timestamp (all using trace_seq_putmem), then whatever the
tracer wants to put after that (if it registered a tracer_event _and_ it
has a ->binary() emitter), when I wanted it to just call ->binary(),
where I would emulate exactly the old blktrace format, then we would be
able to just ask for binary traces, collect them thru
/d/tracing/trace_pipe and pipe them into blkparse for
validation/debugging the ring_buffer + ftrace + blkFtrace code.
I'll try to get a brain dump in the form of working code later
today/early tomorrow, now I'm being preempted by my wife to do those
social things like having dinner and going to the movie theater 8)
