Yes, I've tried ioremap (and placed the address in the ->virtual field), but
had problems with pre-written code that used kmap.  So, basically, what
you're saying is that I must change my code that uses kmap, or
alternatively, allocated page* below the highmem_start_page address.  Is
this correct?

You probably want ioremap(), not kmap().
