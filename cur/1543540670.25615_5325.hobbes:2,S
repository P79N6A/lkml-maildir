Hi all....
I am getting the following error when I try to startx... (KDE on Mandrake
7.0  2.3.42)
----------------------
_FontTransSocketUNIXConnect: Can't connect: errno = 2
failed to set default font path 'unix/:-1'
Fatal server error:
could not open default font 'fixed'
When reporting a problem related to a server crash, please send 
the full server output, not just the last messages
XIO:  fatal IO error 104 (Connection reset by peer) on X server ":0.0"
        after 0 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
------------------------
I found that I had maxed out "/" before I rebooted and got this error, so I
deleted some useless
stuff...... and still, (on hda5, mounted on /) there are 1510032 1k-blocks,
1449412 of which are used,
yet df says that 0 blocks are available... I even did a forced power down,
just so it would check the 
partitions, but it still thinks there is no space available... Any help?
Thanks!
Dan
