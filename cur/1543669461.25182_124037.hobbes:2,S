This has come up before.
The answer is: go ahead and do it, but don't do it in the kernel. Do it
in klogd or similar.
I refuse to clutter the kernel with inane and fragile (and totally
unmaintainable) internationalization code. The string lookup can equally
well be done in user space where it isn't a stability and complexity
issue.
