Yes.

Could it be that you may want to prevent suspend from happening? Or
delay it until system completes some important operation? Do something
else, like cleanly disconnect your network connections? With actual
handling done in userspace it's all possible. With suspend done
directly in kernel it is much harder and couples input subsystem with
power management too tightly.
However if you are dead-set on doin it in kernel you coudl register an
input_handler in your platform PM code and it will attach to your
keyboard. Look for power.c module in older kernels for example.
