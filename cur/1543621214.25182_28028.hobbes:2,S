Looks good...

Are you sure? I mean, that device is southbridge-integrated? Are you
sure it is really on PCI? Does it use PCI interrupt?
Anyway, it is probably less confusing to put the device onto PCI,
because people expect it there, and it was simple enough change. I'll
merge in into my local tree.
Thanx,
