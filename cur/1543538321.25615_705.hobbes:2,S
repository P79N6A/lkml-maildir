Premela,
I don't know if anyone has helped you with your question yet but I will give
you the tips that I know.  I have installed RH on many netfinity's, to run
with an SMP kernel you need to install the kernel sources into /usr/src/ and
they will be in the linux directory in that tree, from there you need to
follow the kernel how-to in the Linux doc project, it is too long for me to
try and explain here.  For the disk partitions I would suggest the man pages
for fsck,however changing partition sizes is a brave venture on a running
machine.  As far as how to do the partition structure, that is entirely up
to you, however it depends what the machine is being used for, if it is
going to be a database you will probably want to separate the data and the
OS and the database applications, the purpose of this is to try and keep the
data from fragmenting.  If anyone has other suggestions or if I have missed
something please include it.

Subject: RedHat Linux 6.0 on Netfinity 5000
I have just installed RedHat Linux 6.0 on IBM netfinity 5000 Server. I did a
server class
installation.
I want some help to do the following :-
1. How to configure the SMP as I am using two Intel Pentium III Processors?
2. Is there a way to resize the partitions while running/using the Linux OS?
3. Any tips on how best to do partitioning on this machine that has 18.2 GB
hard Drive, 384MB RAM
when doing Custom                    class installation
Really appreciate any kind of tips and leads to this matter.
Thanks in advance.
