With hpet=disable (clocksource is acpi_pm ) the usleeps are somewhat
more closer to correct - under idle as well as under kernel
compilation load.
But there are still fluctuations under 100% idle -

Yep, I was about to say that there are indeed real soft-lockups going
on as opposed to the psuedo ones that we thought may be due to timer
inconsistencies.
BTW this is no-preempt config and 2.6.22  and latest Centos-5.1
kernels ran fine with HPET.
