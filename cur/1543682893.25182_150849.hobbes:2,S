From the perspective of an ignorant user, I kinda like the idea of devfs.

Yes, this worked.  I guess now my question is, why does /dev/hdb1 work for 
2.6.0-test1, but not 2.6.0-test1-mm2?
Also, I just started getting oopses during startup and shutdown with 
test1-mm2, EIP at ext3_journaling_dirty_data or something similar, followed 
by a bunch of file not found errors.  I'm getting scared, I have valuable 
data on ext3.  I'll be looking into some way to capture this.
