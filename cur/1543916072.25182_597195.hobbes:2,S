I did not mean to imply that this was a necessary state of affairs.
The marker metadata must be stored in at least one place in the kernel
image - this just happens to be a convenient one that David Smith's
recent systemtap code used.  Without it, we'd probably have to do a
more complicated search, following the pointers within the __markers
structs.  That could work, but it hasn't been built/tested.
So, this proposed change (removal of this section) would break
systemtap, and we have to jump through more hoops to make it work
again.  Is the change worth it?
