	Pathname resolution is a hell of a fundamental thing and kludges
like that are too ugly to be acceptable.  If you can't make that clean
and have to resort to stuffing "special cases" (read: barfbag of ioctl
magnitude) into the areas that might be unspecified by POSIX, don't do it
at all.
	I don't like the amount of handwaving from Hans, but *that* is far
worse.  Vetoed.
