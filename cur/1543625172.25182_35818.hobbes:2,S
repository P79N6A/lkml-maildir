Agreed in general.  That's the way to go.

I have technical concern here.  Is the server violating specs?
Please correct me, if I am wrong.  I've read through rfc1094, rfc1813,
XNFS specification of Opengroup and NFS v3 specification by Sun, I
cannot find the description of... :
	reuse of file handle in server side is wrong.
File handle must be unique.  But I think that it may be reused (for
different type).  Client side cache should handle this case, IMO.
There is an explanation for the file handle in NFS v3 specification by Sun
(
http://www.connectathon.org/nfsv3.pdf
):
----------------------
Servers should try to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between
file handles and files, but this is not required.  Clients should use
file handle comparisons only to improve performance, not for correct
behavior.
----------------------
Current client implementation of Linux uses a file handle for
correctness, in the scenario I've described.
