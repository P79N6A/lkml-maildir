Nonsense.
If `a/b' is updated many times, `a' is updated just once between tree
searching operations.  That's once a day if your operation is updatedb.
It applies recursively, therefore the filesystem very quickly settles
into a state where all the paths that need flagging are already flagged.
The path inodes don't have to remain in memory.
There is no need to cross mountpoints, though it wouldn't make much difference.
