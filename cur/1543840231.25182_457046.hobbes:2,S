Hmm, if there's no reproducible case, next best thing is a git bisect
to try to identify potential commits which are causing the problem...
not easy on your production server, I know.  I had believed this to be
a long-standing issue though, I'm sure I've seen it reported before -
we've never had any information to go on to try to diagnose it however.
Jesper's rename hint is the most helpful information we've had so far.

It basically means a directory inode's btree has got into an invalid
state, somehow.
cheers.
