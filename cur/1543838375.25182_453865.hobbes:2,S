yes, the eHEA currently supports only 4K pages for queues

We already use the h_galpa struct for simulation purposes where we use
this encapsulation to add further required fields to be able to access
the registers (h_galpa has been renamed to h_epa). The name of the
fw_handle element will be changed. Instead of fw_handle, we'll call it
ebus_addr which will make it more readable.
