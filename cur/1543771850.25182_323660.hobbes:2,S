Hello,
it is now a common feature for modern storage controlers to allow online volume resizing.
The Linux kernel SCSI subsystem seems to handle this pretty well through /sys/block/*/device/rescan :
# cat /sys/block/sda/size
41943040
<reconfigure the volume>
# echo 1>/sys/block/sda/device/rescan
# cat /sys/block/sda/size
52428800
# dmseg|tail -2
SCSI device sda: 52428800 512-byte hdwr sectors (26844 MB)
SCSI device sda: drive cache: write through
Still there's something going wrong : in the previous sample, sda had a mounted filesystem on it and BLKGETSIZE still reports the previous size.
If I umount the fs, this ioctl gives the new size, but mount -o remount does not work the same.
Hence, fully online resize is not possible.
Does someone is aware of this, and is it being worked on ?
Best regards,
cvaroqui
