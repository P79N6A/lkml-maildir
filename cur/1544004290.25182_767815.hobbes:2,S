Subject: [patch 11/49] cciss: fix sysfs broken symlink regression
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Mike Miller <mike.miller@hp.com>
commit 404443081ce5e6f68b5f7eda16c959835ff200c0 upstream
Regression introduced by commit 6ae5ce8e8d4de666f31286808d2285aa6a50fa40
("cciss: remove redundant code").
This patch fixes a broken symlink in sysfs that was introduced by the
above commit.  We broke it in 2.6.27-rc on or about 20080804.  Some
installers are broken if this symlink does not exist and they may not
detect the logical drives configured on the controller.  It does not
require being backported into 2.6.26.x or earlier kernels.
