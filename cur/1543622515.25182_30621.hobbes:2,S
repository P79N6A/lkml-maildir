Sigh.  Not to single you out, George - I see abject misunderstanding
and misinformation about this sort of thing all over the place.
So let's make some statements:
- preemption is more expensive that explicit scheduling points.   Always
  was, always shall be.
- Anyone who has performed measurements knows that preemption is
  ineffective.  Worst-case latencies are still up to 100 milliseconds.
- preemptability is a *basis* for getting a maintainable low-latency
  kernel.   And that's the reason why I support its merge into 2.5.  Same
  with Ingo, I expect.
  But there's a lot of icky stuff to be done yet to make it effective.

lock-break is missing the cross-SMP reschedule hack, so on SMP it'll
still have very high worst-case latencies.  If all the other parts
of the low-latency patch were included then preempt+lock-break should
give better results than low-latency.
