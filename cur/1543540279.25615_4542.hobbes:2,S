Hi,
I noticed that the TCP code (linux 2.2.14) locks the
socket (using lock_sock()) before doing a send
(tcp_do_sendmsg), and during a receive (tcp_recvmsg).
Besides that, I have seen lock_sock() being called at
a number of other places in the TCP code.
Could someone please explain to me the working of
lock_sock(), and in what cases it should be called?
The reason I am looking at lock_sock is because I have
a project in which I create 2 INET sockets (say s1 and
s2), and each socket can receive data, that it sends
down through the other. For ex: s1 receives some data,
processes it, and sends it through s2, and vice versa.
I think I have to lock the socket that I am sending
data down on, but am not too sure if I have to lock
the receiving socket as well.
Thanks,
Mahesh.
