please try to reproduce w/o devfs and/or w/o a kernel module that is
loadable called ipt_psd (netfilter stuff likely, but not part of
mainline pre6/pre7). probably it'll go away either ways and it seems
triggered by the process called couriertcpd. Not sure exactly what's
going on though, since looking into devfs/devfsd doesn't sound
interesting anymore and I don't see the netfilter code out of mainline.
(probably this email will get some delay, so apologies if it is obsolete
by the time it reaches the network)
