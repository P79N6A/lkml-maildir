Can I just point out that the reiserfs3.6 delays that I originally reported 
with the preempt threshhold test did not come up once the patch was fixed. I 
have my preempt threshold set at 1ms and did not see one single reiserfs 
dump in my syslog. ie I don't think I am personally seeing any significant 
reiserfs3.6 latencies.
Cheers,
