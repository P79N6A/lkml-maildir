The above omits some details but is basically correct. Note that the
time_interpolator gradually brings time back into sync with xtime because
it looses a few nanoseconds (depending on the clock) each tick. At
some point the correction asked for by the timer tick will be greater than the
offset and at that time the offset is set to zero. Then a resync has
occurred.

Having time stand still is an awkward solution: Time may stand
still even longer if the tick is delayed and then time suddenly jumps
ahead when the tick finally occurs.
The existing implementation slowly compensates and is the best solution
IMHO.

What I described was coded by others. I just hope that I have explained it
accurately.
