Just a side note: you don't need to use the logging design to have data
journaling too. You can have data journaling also without logging design.
IMVHO logging filesystem are _way_ superior for webservers with some dozen
of giga of ram where all the working set fits in cache and _only_ writes
goes to disk but that's another issue.
