Subject: setting up EFI on x86

I just got an older x86 desktop system and I wanted to learn about EFI
by booting the kernel using this instead of the older MBR-style boot
process. Does anyone know how I can set up such a system on x86?
Specifically, what tools can I use to create a GPT disk? Do I need a
special BIOS to do this?
Thanks for any help with this.
