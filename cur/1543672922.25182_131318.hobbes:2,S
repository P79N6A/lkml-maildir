It would be nice, though, not to have to worry about differentiating between
pioctls that take a path and those that don't inside of the core kernel.

Thinking about it, this shouldn't take an argument at all, and should just put
its caller into a completely new PAG with a unique ID.

Yes. After all, you might need the key to be available before you can mount.
This may be useful for samba too... The mount command for samba typically
requires authentication data to be passed as options (workgroup, username,
password).

"I" being the calling process? That can be done. I could just define that it
is permissible for the PAG pointer to be NULL. This makes support for the init
process easier, as I don't have to compile in a PAG for it.

So you'd have a list of tokens associated with the user too?
I suppose I could give both the PAG and the user lists, and search the PAG
first, then the user, but what detemines the user? The PAG, the opener of a
file or the current process?

The latter pair of pioctls you've mentioned both require the directory holding
the mount point to be locally available as a kernel inode, and both of them
require the path to that directory to be supplied as the path argument to
pioctl rather than the path of the mountpoint, so I don't see that there'd be
a problem there.
I don't have documentation on VIOCPREFETCH, but if it's anything like the
other two, then it shouldn't be a problem either.

It may be possible to do this through the sysfs filesystem in 2.5 instead.
