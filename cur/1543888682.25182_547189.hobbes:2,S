Can you bisect it? Just do
	git bisect start
	git bisect good v2.6.21
	git bisect bad v2.6.22-rc1
and start testing the end result. The bisection thing is pretty efficient, 
so while there's almost 5000 commits in there, you realy shouldn't need to 
test more than ten kernels to get it narrowed down to just five commits or 
so, and since it seems to be very repeatable and noticeable for you, 
bisecting should be the trivial thing to figure out what broke.
David: all the blather about network drivers and/or /proc/net/tcp being 
slow anyway misses the *big* point: it didn't use to do this. So there's a 
new bug there. Maybe something keeps sockets around in a dead state on the 
hash lists or whatever. Mayube something else breaks his bittorrent 
client. Whatever. We don't know. But it's a regression.
