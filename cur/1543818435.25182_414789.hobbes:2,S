Hi there,
	I have a module which registers with the reboot notifier (register_reboot_notifier(...)); but I have a problem : My handler is called with SYS_POWER_OFF when the system is rebooted and is not called with SYS_POWER_OFF when the system is actually powering off.
	My goal is to track power off in order to turn the power off, on a special hardware without APM or ACPI.
	Did I make something wrong ?
Thanks
	Yannick
