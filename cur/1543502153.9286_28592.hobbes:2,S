I've had zImage fail and bzImage not fail due to a problem with the
setup dependancy that wasn't there with the bsetup dependancy. The
root cause was that the kernel was too big, but it hit in a different
place, and didn't produce the "Kernel is too big" message as a result.

An even easier way would be to simply do the "make bzImage" if the
"make zImage" failed, and that would have the advantage over your
method of never failing to run "make bzImage" when it needs to be
run...

It could be...

Try doing the "make modules" with modules disabled, and you soon
discover that it reports an error...

To answer that, let's look at what "make dep" and "make clean" do...
 1. "make dep" goes through the source files and determines the
    dependancies that exist when compiled for a given configuration.
    Therefore, this step ONLY needs doing if the configuration has
    been changed since it was last done.
 2. "make clean" goes through the kernel source tree and removes all
    of the files produced as a by-product of compilation, as they may
    have been produced based on incorrect dependancy information. It
    therefore only needs doing if "make dep" has been done since it
    was last done.
In fact, if you analyse that carefully, you will note that the
following logic is correct by definition:
 Q> #!/bin/bash
 Q> cd /usr/src/linux
 Q> if [ .config -nt .depend ]; then
 Q>     make dep clean
 Q> fi
In other words, that part of the procedure only needs doing if .config
is not older than .depend (both being in the /usr/src/linux directory).
Your script may wish to take advantage of that fact...

I have recently set up several different 386dx/{16,20,25} based
systems as print servers and inter-network-segment gateways for a
school, and I would hate to compile a modern Linux kernel on one of
those systems.
Perhaps the script could be split into two parts, one to run on the
target system to determine the required configuration, and one to run
on the compilation system to control the compilation process - and
which, if used in mode 2, produces a tarball ready to be extracted on
the target system that drops the modules in the relevant directory and
puts the kernel image in its relevant directory...

The big problem with that idea is keeping the database up to date,
unless you plan on buying one of every different card that comes
out...
One other thought - is your script going to be i386 only?
Best wishes from Riley.
