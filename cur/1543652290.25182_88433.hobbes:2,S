If a read was not merged with another read on the tail->head walk
the read will be inserted near the head.  The head->tail walk bypasses
all reads, six (default) writes and then inserts the new read.
It has the shortcoming that earlier reads may be walked past in the
tail->head phase.  It's a three-liner to prevent that but I was never
able to demonstrate any difference.

It has been discussed: boost a request to head-of-queue when a thread
starts to wait on a buffer/page which is inside that request.
But we don't care about synchronous writes.  As long as we don't
starve them out completely, optimise the (vastly more) common case.

Think about two threads.  One is generating a stream of writes and
the other is trying to read a file.  The reader needs to read the 
directory, the inode, the first data blocks, the first indirect and
then some more data blocks.  That's at least three synchronous reads.
Even if those reads are placed just three requests from head-of-queue,
the reader will make one tenth of the progress of the writer.
And the current code places those reads 64 requests from head-of-queue.
When the various things which were congesting write queueing were fixed
in the 2.5 VM a streaming write was slowing such read operations down by
a factor of 4000.
