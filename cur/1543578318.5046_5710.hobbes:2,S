I should make it clear that there are two hard drives.  One
1 Gb hard drive, and 1x14 Gb hard drive.

Subject: 2.2.18 reboots on high load.
Hello,
I have a 2.2.18 (with reiserfs patch), running on a Pentium 100
any time I get high disk writes or reads my system just reboots.
I have had it up and running with moderate disk activity (telnet
and small FTP's) for a week; however, when I write alot to the 
disk (100 Mb plus), the system just reboots.  I am also getting
kernel panics around every 3-4 times.  I tried writing to the disk
with Samba, and fith FTP.  I am running proFTP.  Please tell me
what I need to send you.  I will not that /proc/cpuinfo tells me that
my processor has a f00f bug?
The system is as follows.
Intel Pentium 100
32 Mb Ram
1Gb root partition - 32 Mb swap
14 Gb reiserfs partition
I am running Samba 2.0.7 and Apache 1.3.14 (with mod-ssl).
