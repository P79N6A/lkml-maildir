Hmmm... I have a computer here that freezes at this point in the boot
process with 2.2.21-pre4:
...
CPU: L2 cache: 128K
Intel machine check architecture supported.
Reversing the following change to bluesmoke.c lets this computer boot
again like it does with 2.2.21-pre3. The computer in question has a 533MHz
Intel Celeron (the Pentium II-based kind).
