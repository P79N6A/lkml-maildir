Subject: patch 10/38: CLIENT: new fields in 'struct nfs_mount_data'
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch changes 'struct nfs_mount_data' to include some new fields
which will be passed down by the mount program:
  @mnt_path - In NFSv4, the client kernel obtains the mount path
              and is responsible for doing LOOKUP's component by
              component, starting with the root of the pseudo
              filesystem, until the filehandle of the mount point
              is obtained.  This is in contrast with previous
              versions, in which the mount program obtains the
              filehandle of the mount point from mountd.
  @ip_addr  - The mount program fills this in with the client's
              own IP address.  This is used to set the client's
              clientid (an identifier, unique to the client,
              which the client sends to the server), and also
              to send callback information to the server.
It also defines new mount flags NFS_MOUNT_VER4, NFS_MOUNT_STRICTLOCK.
The STRICTLOCK flag will be used in a subsequent patch which implements
byte-range file locking.
Finally, this patch increases the filehandle size to 128 bytes, but also
changes the definition of the 'root' field in 'struct nfs_mount_data'
so that it remains a 64-byte filehandle (to ensure binary compatibility
with pre-NFSv4 versions of the mount program).
