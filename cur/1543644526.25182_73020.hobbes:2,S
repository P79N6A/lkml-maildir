No, please don't move this off to another mailing list.  This is where
the majority of all kernel programmers are, don't try to make us move to
yet-another-mailing-list just to discuss your project.  If you want our
contributions, and want our input, use this list.
If you stay on smaller mailing lists, like cg-discuss and
hardened-drivers, you do not reach the widest group of people, which is
what you will have to do if you want to have a chance for your
contributions to become part of the main kernel.

Where would these locations be?

Sorry, but major kernel driver discussions should occur on lkml.
