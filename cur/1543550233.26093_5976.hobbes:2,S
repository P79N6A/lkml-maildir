Agree. I never said that C++ was bad. I just use the language that I think
is best suited for the job. I usually end up with C, sometimes C++.

You don't. Someone else might think he does need it and screws things
up. The kernel is already full of compiler-specific stuff.

C is more asm alike (read : lowlevel) then C++. That's a fact. That fact
can be used to verify what asm the compiler generates, and if it is
correct.
Since I'm not interested in what code it actually generated I don't
care. Some people do.

I'm only saying that C++ in the kernel is bad. Not that C++ is bad,
because it isn't.
