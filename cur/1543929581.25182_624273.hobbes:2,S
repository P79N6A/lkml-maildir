No. Unacceptable. This is a memory leak in case nobody retries it. It's 
basically not how you can do this thing.
The *only* thing you can pass for a system call restart is the argument 
block register state. If that is not enough, then you cannot restart it. 
It's that simple.
Andrew, please do *not* put this in any queues. It's fundamentally broken, 
and cannot be fixed as is.
