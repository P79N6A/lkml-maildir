But unless you trigger undefined behaviour, strcpy(x, "foobar" + n) is
equal to memcpy(x, "foobar" + n, sizeof("foobar") - n); and the latter is
more efficient (you don't have to check for end-of-string during copying).

It just happens to do a different thing than it used to when seeing code
with particular case of undefined behaviour.
