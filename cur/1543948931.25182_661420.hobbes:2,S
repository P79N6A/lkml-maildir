Thanks to Raphael for pointing me at the above bugzilla URL!
Yannick,
Would you be willing to try your test again after applying the
patch in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/2/11
 and rebuilding your
kernel?
This patch does not appear to be in 2.6.25-rc3.  :-(
I am reposting this patch separately.
							Thanx, Paul
