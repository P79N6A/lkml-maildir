cf. my eariler comment about kcodad. Local file access _does_ go through the 
kernel, so if we have kcodad, we can keep the consistency guarantees quite 
happily.
As an added bonus, we shouldn't even need to screw with the VFS (much) to add
the necessary hooks... 
When a filesystem is exported by kcodad, it can change the fops for the 
underlying filesystem to point to its own wrappers.
So when an ext2 filesystem is exported by coda, all files on that filesystem 
now have codad_wrapper_fops instead of ext2_file_operations (can this be done 
on the fly? What about files that are already open?)
So all ext2 file access is then enforced to be through the codad routines, and
we don't have to worry about direct access by local processes any more. We can 
keep track of everything.
If we can't retrospectively change the fops for existing files, we may need 
a mount option (-ocodad) which causes the fops for the filesystem at mount 
time to be set to something like...
static ssize_t codad_wrapper_write(struct file * filp, const char * buf,
                          size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
	if (CODAD_ACTIVE(filp->f_dentry->sb))
		return codad_write(filp, buf, count, ppos);
	else
		return filp->old_fops->write(filp, buf, count, ppos);
	/* Of course, there's not actually a 'filp->old_fops' and that's
	 * not where we'd really put it, but you get the idea.
	 */
}
