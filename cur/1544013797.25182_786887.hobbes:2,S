Arguably it should. I don't know what the concurrent C standard looks like,
but prohibiting reloads of potentially concurrently modified memory when
there is no explicit pointer dereference is the natural complement to
prohibiting stores to potentially concurrently read memory when there is
no explicit store (which I think is begrudgingly agreed to be a problem).

I think I would like to see multiple reloads to local variables prohibited,
to avoid potential really subtle problems... But if ACCESS_ONCE is here to
stay, then I do think that atomic_read etc should use it.
