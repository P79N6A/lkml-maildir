No..but I hear people say "CD-ROM disc" regularly, though (Yes, I know
it's "Compact Disc Read Only Memory disc", which is silly, but people use
it). 
Mind you, the point I was trying to make was that it was 'disc' and not
'disk' in this case, I just didn't put it across very well.
Apologies to those brought up in the Acorn world who use 'disc'
exclusively. I should've known that, considering the amount of time I
spent with the BBC B.. *grin*.
Would it not be possible for devfs to cater for both spellings?
