It means that the design is flawed and if done right, file flags
which are changeable by fcntl (O_NONBLOCK, O_APPEND, O_ASYNC, O_DIRECT, 
O_NOATIME) shouldn't be shared, they are useless as shared.
IOW, they should be file _descriptor_ flags.
It's unlikely that kernel tribe leaders will agree to violate POSIX
and make fcntl(F_SETFL) be per-fd thing. There can be users of this
(mis)feature.
Making fcntl(F_SETFD) accept those same flags and making it override
F_SETFL flags may fare slightly better, but may require propagation
of these flags into *a lot* of kernel codepaths.

I am submitting a patch witch allows this. Let's see what people will say.
Yet another way to fix this problem is to add a new fcntl operation
"duplicate an open file":
fd = fcntl(fd, F_DUPFL, min_fd);
which is analogous to F_DUPFD, but produces _unshared_ file descriptor.
You can F_SETFL it as you want, no one else will be affected.

Yep, maybe. But this is a different problem.
IOW: there are cases where one doesn't want this kind of locking,
but simply needs to do unblocked read/write. That's what I'm trying
to solve.
