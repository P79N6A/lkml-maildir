Greetings,

[drm] Initialized i830 1.3.2 20021108 on minor 1: Intel Corp. 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (#2)
when starting X i'm getting the following in dmesg:
mtrr: base(0xb0020000) is not aligned on a size(0x180000) boundary
mtrr: 0xb0000000,0x8000000 overlaps existing 0xb0000000,0x400000
is there any way to get both working together? (fb + mtrr)
Thanks, sebastian
