    I made a small patch to allow the input of a c-cedilla (for french) with 'c.
    This is the way it is handled on the X terminals.
    I left the old ,c there, though I don't know how sb. would produce a dead
    comma (maybe on french keyboards, it's possible ...).
    Please apply. Or tell me of a better solution.
The keyboard handling is very flexible.
All you want (including creating a dead comma) is possible already.
Study the use of the Compose keyword for keymaps -
see loadkeys(1) and keymaps(5).
