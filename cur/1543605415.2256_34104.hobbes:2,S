Hmm, yeah, on this box with 640 MB I see:
TCP: Hash tables configured (established 262144 bind 65536)
(I'm guessing this means that the hash table has 32k buckets.)
Yes, that's fairly large, but not that huge for machines which will have
tons of sockets open.
Normally we use nothing like that:
sockets: used 133
TCP: inuse 118 orphan 3 tw 171 alloc 119 mem 132
RAW: inuse 0
FRAG: inuse 0 memory 0
...but shrinking the size slightly won't really fix the problem, it will
just make it less obvious.
Direct lookups for identd, service probes, etc., are definitely the
better way to go, but it would be nice if netstat didn't suck as well.
