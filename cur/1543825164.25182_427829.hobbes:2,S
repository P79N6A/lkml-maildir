Yes, I understand your remark.
I have looked at the twisty maze of alternatives code, but Gerd
(added to To:) is really who needs to reply IMO.
Based on my source code reading, it is just scary but harmless.
alternatives_smp_unlock() and alternatives_smp_lock() are passed
beginning and end addresses of text sections and they ignore
(init/exit) code addresses that are outside of the text code
range.
One comment says:
	/* .text segment, needed to avoid patching init code ;) */
and the code does appear to implement that.
I would make one small change to the code, however.
In alternatives_smp_lock() and alternatives_smp_unlock(), change
		if (*ptr > text_end)
			continue;
to
		if (*ptr >= text_end)
			continue;
because text_end is text_start + text_size, so text_end could be
the beginning of the next section.  However, in practice this
may not matter.
