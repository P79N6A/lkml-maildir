Hrm, I didn't mention any alsalib version, because this is what apt told
me:
root@arkanoid:/home/nacc# aptitude search alsa | grep ^i
i   alsa-base                       - ALSA driver configuration files
i   alsa-utils                      - ALSA utilities
root@arkanoid:/home/nacc# aptitude search alsa | grep lib
v   alsalib                         -
v   alsalib0.1.3                    -
v   alsalib0.3.0                    -
v   alsalib0.3.0-dev                -
v   alsalib0.3.2                    -
v   alsalib0.3.2-dev                -
Am I missing something?
Thanks,
Nish
