We might not be using atomic_t (and ops) if we already have a higher-level
locking scheme, actually. So as Herbert mentioned, such cases might just
not care. [ Too much of this thread, too little sleep, sorry! ]
Anyway, the problem, of course, is that this conversion to a stronger /
safer-by-default behaviour doesn't happen with zero cost to performance.
Converting atomic ops to "volatile" behaviour did add ~2K to kernel text
for archs such as i386 (possibly to important codepaths) that didn't have
those semantics already so it would be constructive to actually look at
those differences and see if there were really any heisenbugs that got
rectified. Or if there were legitimate optimizations that got wrongly
disabled. Onus lies on those proposing the modifications, I'd say ;-)
