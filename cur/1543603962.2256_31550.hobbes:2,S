   DNS maybe? What is your DNS servers topology? Are you using 
any caching DNS server? I've seen that happen in a company that 
was using an external DNS server from their isp, and in times of 
extreme internet link usage the problem would appear. Heck, even 
their sql queries would block for around 60 seconds in the 
Windows machines they used. It must have left lots of SAP 
consultants scratching their heads. :)
