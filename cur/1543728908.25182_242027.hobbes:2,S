Hi Andrew.
Any good way we can bring this patch forward?
Currently it causes 9 rejects in -mm, and I understand why you are not
inclined to fix that up.
I can see clashes with at least LOCKMETER, SCHEDSTATS and KGDB in -mm.
Would it be better to divide it in smaller parts?
o lib/Kconfig.debug
o i386 specific changes
o ia64 specific changes
o architectures that do not cause rejects in -mm + -vanilla
o etc.
The rejects may still be present, but make it easier to pick what
applies, and drop the rest for now.
Along the lines of Kconfig.drivers - but hopefully introduced a bit faster.
