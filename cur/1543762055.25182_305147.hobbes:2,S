From looking at the code gcc generates it looks to me like the bennefits
of the smaller code should outweigh the overhead of a few more function
calls - especially if the branch is usually taken (which I must admit I 
can't really tell if it will be). If the branch is rarely taken you are 
probably right.

Huh? I just checked 2.6.12-rc1-mm1, and the user_destroy function still 
looks as above...  But no problem, I'll just send Andrew the bits in 
security/selinux/ for now and wait a bit with the rest. 
Thank you for your comments.
