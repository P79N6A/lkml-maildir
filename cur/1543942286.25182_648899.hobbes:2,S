No Linux does not work like this at all.
Like Alan said, you really need to brush up on your basic IP law, as
well as some basic technical issues regarding how the Linux kernel
works before trying to make statements like this.
Also see the various issues surrounding "loadable modules" and Samba,
and how they have successfully enforced the "linking" and other type
issues that are being discussed here (shims, "GPL condoms", etc.) with
regards to the GPLv2 and derivative works.
good luck,
