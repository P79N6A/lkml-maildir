We're only talking about going fast if we detect that things have gone well.

	Thanks for the reference.  Pointing to the actual standards
makes these discussions a lot more efficient.
	What I said to Andre about software reset also apparently
applies to hardware reset.
	The state diagram that you refer to for hardware reset is on
page 312 of ATA/ATAPI-6 revision 3b, 28 February 2002 and
page 85 of ATA/ATAPI-7 revision 0d, 8 July 2002.  As with
software reset, BSY is asserted within 400ns of reset being asserted
and remains set until the transition at the end of the diagram
(D0HR3:Set_Status --> Device_idle_S).
	So, I think that Eric Biederman's suggestion about waiting for
BSY to clear, so as to accomodate Power On Self Test that can complete
in under 31 seconds should be OK.
