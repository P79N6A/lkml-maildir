Hi
I had problems in my implementation of Profibus-protocol, because my 
FDL-State machine is implemented in tasklets and
sometimes there were situations, where Soft-Irqs were disabled for 
20-40mS (Coldfire 5485 / 96MHz).
After inserting some testpoints in kernels source, doing dump_stack(), 
when the jiffie-time get longer then 20mS,
i detected the place of the long Soft-Irq disable in function
static void br_forward_delay_timer_expired(..)
inside file "net/bridge/br_stp_timer.c"
It does a
spin_lock_bh(..);
... some functionality;
spin_unlock_bh(..);
Does anybody know, why the functionality inbetween lock/unlock takes so long
(2-4 jiffies @ HZ=100)
Thank You
