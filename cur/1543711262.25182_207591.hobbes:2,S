I think it's good for cd-burning too. Currently most of the distros set
the suid bit for cdrecord (wich implies some security bugs). You can
workaround that by changing the devide node's permissions and kill the suid bit:
brw-rw----    1 root     burning     22,   0 2003-05-23 16:41 /dev/cd-rw
but still cdrecord will cry:
cdrecord: Operation not permitted. WARNING: Cannot do mlockall(2).
cdrecord: WARNING: This causes a high risk for buffer underruns.
With that patch desktop users will be able to burn cds without falling into
buffer underruns and without using the suid hack, I guess? Nice work :)
