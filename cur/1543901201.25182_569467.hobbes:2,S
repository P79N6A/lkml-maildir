It is really missing :-(

I can see the bug. Thanks for updating me. I really missed the point
that these whole set of drivers are a part of hisax.ko...
most of the initialization is done in hisax/config.c
Now are you suggesting that we should have a pci_dev_put in config.c
where you have the module_exit.
I am not sure where I can call the dev_put.
consider hisax/avm_pci.c  
in which if we have a code like the below
dev_avm = pci_get_device(PCI_VENDOR_ID_AVM,
		PCI_DEVICE_ID_AVM_A1,  dev_avm))) {
dev_avm is getting initialized in this file 
static struct pci_dev *dev_avm __devinitdata = NULL;
so can I do an
extern static struct pci_dev *dev_avm; 
in the config.c 
and call pci_dev_put(dev_avm) in config.c file's module_exit or
whereever there is an error return?
