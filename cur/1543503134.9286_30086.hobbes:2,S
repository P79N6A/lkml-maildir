Sending SIGSTP or a unrelated signal have near the same cost.
Similar waitpid for a STOP and sigwaitinfo.
It depends on what you find more important:
latency from creation to child run [sigqueueinfo/sigwaitinfo have a slight advantage
here because it can simply run through without caring about the parent]
or
latency from calling pthread_create to its return [SIGSTP/waitpid may be better here,
because the final thread restart is decoupled from the caller]
On UP it probably makes not much difference because one CPU has to do all the work 
anyways, on SMP it may look different.

What I didn't like with your idea is that it is 100% equivalent (even from the
work the kernel has to do) to  kill(getpid(), SIGSTP);  at the beginning
of the child.
