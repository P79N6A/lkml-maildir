Are there any plans to add zero copy transmit support to the eepro100
driver?
In looking at the archives from a year or so ago, I noticed that at
that time there was
no support in the driver because of difficulties in identifying which
cards have the
necessary hardware csum and scatter/gather support.   Is this still the
problem?
If there are no plans to add this to eepro100.c, does anyone know if
the Intel
provided driver in addon/e100 will be supporting this soon?
Thanks,
Dave Rorke
