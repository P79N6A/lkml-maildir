Actually how about this one instead?  The PEGASUS bit is the same.
The difference is that MII (and CRC32) are only attributed to the
driver code that needs those ... AX8817X needs both, ZAURUS just
needs CRC32.  The core (which should eventually become a separate
module) shouldn't depend on those modules at all.
Also both CDCETHER and AX8817X are marked as non-experimental;
I recall Dave Hollis submitted a patch to do that for AX8817X,
and CDCETHER now seems to have gotten enough success reports too.
