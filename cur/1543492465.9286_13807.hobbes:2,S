It's at least occasionally reproducible.  I've seen it a couple more
times since posting that.
As there has been no response, I'm going to clutter the list a bit by
listing my somewhat random guesses as to the cause, in hopes that it
will ring a bell with someone.
* `zap_page_range' in mm/memory.c contains this somewhat suspicious
snippet:
        if (mm->rss > 0) {
                mm->rss -= freed;
                if (mm->rss < 0)
                        mm->rss = 0;
        }
rss is an unsigned long, and presumably the author forgot that (or it
changed later).  Thus, the tests are meaningless and probably a bug in
themselves.  But a question: Does their presence mean that rss could
legitimately become "negative", and these would correct it when it
happens?  Or is it a paranoia test to minimize damage in case of the
impossible happening?
* `do_wp_page' contains:
        if (PageReserved(mem_map + MAP_NR(old_page)))
                ++vma->vm_mm->rss;
I don't completely understand the Linux mm model, but this seems odd. 
At this point in the code (handling copy-on-write), a new page has been
allocated and is about to be put into the process's memory map. 
Oughtn't this to increase rss regardless of the attributes of the old
page?
* The fact that I saw this problem only with dosemu makes me wonder if
the bug is in something only it does.  `mark_screen_rdonly' in
arch/i386/kernel/vm86.c does some fiddling with the process's page
tables, and doesn't change rss.  As far as I can tell, all it does is
take pages that are already present and write-protect them, in which
case rss probably shouldn't change.  But as I said, I don't completely
understand mm, so this could easily be wrong.
Lastly, I realize rss is essentially just tourist information, so its
correctness isn't (AFAIK) critical.  However, negative values are
obviously bogus, so IMHO this is a bug.  I'd like to see it fixed
correctly (i.e. not just a fix-the-symptom `if ((long)rss < 0) rss=0'
kind of thing).
As I said, I can reproduce this somewhat regularly, and I'm willing to
test patches or any other such thing.
Thanks for reading; any response is appreciated.
