After rereading the thread (after my first cup of coffee this time), I
see that the problem was slightly different than what I had. The thread
showed some delay before the console was initialized (the EDD code). But
I'm experiencing the delay with the wait_not_busy.
My problem is that the secondary status register is returning busy when
there isn't anything there.  So I have to wait 35 seconds for the
timeout to expire.  This could just be a fluke with the way the board is
designed (it wouldn't surprise me).
