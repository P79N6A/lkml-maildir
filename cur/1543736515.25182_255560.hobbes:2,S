  How unresponsive exactly it is? Can you switch consoles and write? I
suppose ps(1) hangs... Is the disk working?
You can compile kernel with the magic Sysrq key (it is the option in the
kernel debugging section), run it and then press alt-sysrq-t and the
state of all processes will be printed. That might help...
