Agreed, it seems like a good idea to have a filesystem timestamp.
The future field should probably be saved for use as the offset of a
"secondary superblock" (or something like that) rather than squandered
for one field.  At least, I think that was the original intent for the
field and it has always been my plan.
Maybe it would be easiest to overload the super.fsid.edition field?
Then you could have an option (probably a backward-compatible flag in
the superblock, but could be compile-time or mount-time) that indicates
that the edition number is a timestamp.
