Hi!
A while ago I wrote that console output on a sparc can interrput mpg123
for long enough to start skipping.
Here is a little program to show this. It does not work too "good" on
intel/vgacon, but on sparc, alpha, and intel/vesafb is does
demonstrate the problem.
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#define size 1024*1024*16
main()
{
   char *mem=malloc(size);
   memset(mem,'\014',size);
   for(;;)
      write(1,mem,size);
}
   Alexander.
