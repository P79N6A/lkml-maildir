This is but one reason why I will _refuse_ to make case insensitivity
magically start happening on regular "open()" etc calls.
You'd literally have to use a _different_ system call to do a 
case-insensitive file open. Exactly because anything else would be very 
confusing to existing apps (and thus be potential security holes).
