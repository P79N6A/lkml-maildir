Perhaps I worded that poorly.  When I used 'better', there was an
implicit 'to merge' stemming from the context of the question. I
was saying that I consider the one to be a fine tool and therefore
a candidate for possible inclusion in the ikd tool-box, but cannot
comment on the other because I haven't seen it (yet).
