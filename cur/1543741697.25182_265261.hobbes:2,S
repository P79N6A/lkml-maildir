IMHO there's something not quite right with the Silicon Image libata
driver; I've encountered this "IRQ xx: Nobody cared!" with such a
controller in a number of (slower) systems. In that case, it never works
for me.  In other systems, it doesn't give the "nobody cared" message
during module loading, and then it works fine.
Perhaps the driver is enabling the hardware to generate interrupts
before setting up the interrupt routine for it? Please excuse my
ignorance if I'm talking nonsense here :-)
I can perform tests if necessary...
