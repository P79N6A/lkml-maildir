I have a patch at 
http://home.attbi.com/~minyard/highres-2.4.17.patch
 that
adds a config item that times CPU usage at microsecond resolution.  It's 
only
for the 2.4.17 kernel, I don't know what the porting effort would be for 
other
kernels.
It's not a great patch, it would need some work to be really clean from 
a code
quality point of view, but it does seem to work.  With it you can use 
getrusage()
to get the actual time your process has used between two points.  It 
works on
x86 and PPC.
Plus, obviously, this adds significant time to system calls and interrupts.
