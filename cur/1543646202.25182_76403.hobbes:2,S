I've got 25TB uncompressed of HSM here, and it's cost us (ex VAT)
roughly:
£10k for the first 1.6TB (on NT, DLT library)
£18k for the next  6.0TB (on NT, LTO library)
£45k for the next 18.0TB (on Solaris, LTO Library)
...for the software licencing alone. Plus about 10% pa. in support
costs.
You're looking at about 50-60% of the library cost for the HSM software
to manage it (tapes are another thing). Is HSM really that difficult?
It really is a racket, but it's not so much compared with the
cost of re-producing the data (mainly digitized collections).
I'd be happier about it if they were more reliable (libs and s/w).
Disk arrays, on the other hand, would cost us a fortune in
upgrading the cooling - we've had to do this once just because of
the 3-4 TB of online storage we've got, and adding huge exchangers
(and associated pipes) isn't something I want to do much of.
Oh, and having spent much of last night and this morning dealing
with multiple SCSI disk failures, and having seen about 5% of
ours fail in a year, I'm rapidly seeing the light on IDE.
