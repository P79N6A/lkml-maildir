ah, i now understand what you mean. The stuff in -mm that touches 
arch/x86 is for actively maintained areas which are generally quite 
clean.
So this is not a problem in practice - massively unclean areas of code, 
which are the primary target for cleanups, are not actively developed. [ 
perhaps because there's some level of correlation between unclean code 
and lack of developer interest :-/ ]
