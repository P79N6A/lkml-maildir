On 20 May, Tim Waugh spewed forth:
:: 
:: Here's what I'd like you to do:
:: 
:: 1. Have all the parport/ppa/lp stuff as modules.
Ok, did that and booted with the new kernel.
:: 2. Fresh boot, load the parport, parport_pc, and lp modules, and check
:: that printing works when the Zip drive isn't there.
Printer is hooked to the parallel port.  Printed a couple of test pages
(including your message!).
:: 3. Then plug the Zip drive in, and the printer into it, and see if
:: printing works.  If not, it pretty much has to be a hardware problem.
Ok, only the lp, parport, parport_pc modules loaded.  Zip is plugged in
again and powered on. Printed another couple of test pages.
:: 4. With the Zip drive still in, load the ppa module.  Find out if printing
:: works.  If it did before, and doesn't now, it's a parport/ppa interaction.
Loaded the ppa module.  Now have ppa, lp, parport, and parport_pc
loaded.  Tried to print a couple of test pages.  Nothing doing. Stopped
cold.
:: Try powering off and on the Zip drive and see if printing works again.
:: 
Ok, did that.  Printing started again. I loaded/mounted a disk, and
printing stopped. Powered the Zip off again, and the printer started
printing again.  Of course, this generates read errors when reading
files from the zip, until I umount/mount it again, which effectively
disables printing until I turn off and back on the Zip, thereby
creating a vicious cycle.
:: Let me know what happens.
That's about it.
