Hello
I have experienced similar behaviour with kswapd/kupdated with 2.4.12 and
2.4.13 .  After much struggle, I discovered that the system had become
slugish and non-responsive because i was using the wrong IDE busmastering
and DMA drivers (VIA chipset) instead of the correct ones for my
motherboard (PROMISE chipset). If you are using IDE, then perhaps you have
something similar and are using the incorrect drivers?
If you are indeed using IDE then suggest that you turn of busmastering all
together and give it another try.
Ahmed.
