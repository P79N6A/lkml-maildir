Couple of thoughts:
1. red/black b-trees have superior worst case performance as it
relates to rebalancing, and the implementation doesn't add a
lot of complexity:

2. Paul Vixie's b-tree implementation has been around since the mid-80's
or so, and simply from an historical perspective is worth a look
(comp.sources.unix anyone?):
http://www.isc.org/index.pl?/sources/devel/func/avl-subs-2.php
3. GCC uses 'splay trees' to good advantage:

which have the property that most-recently referenced nodes
tend to be higher up in the tree.
