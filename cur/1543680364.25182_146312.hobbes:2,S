Hi,
	I'm trying to port the ipc stuff to work as a subsystem in order to
have sysfs outputs (/sysfs/ipc/sem {,shm,msg} ) .
	Output I have is an early oops (which is not reported in /var/log
...)
	It seems the ipc stuff init begins before kobject stuff or something
?
"EIP is at sysfs_create_dir
<0>kernel panic : attempted to kill the idle task!
"
Here is my patch attached + complete files
Someone could help ?
Regards,
Fabian
