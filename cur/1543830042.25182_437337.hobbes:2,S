But doesn't the whole imacfb commit only make sense while booting  
native from efi? and booting native from efi is in the moment only  
possible through this patch.
with kind regards
thomas
PS: and i can't boot via csm at the moment, because i use gpt only!  
and i don't want to mix up old style partition table and gpt like  
boot camp do.
