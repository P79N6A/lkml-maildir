The system is not OOM, it is in reclaim, a transient condition that will be
resolved in normal course by IO progress.  However you raise an excellent
point: if there is any remote management that we absolutely require to be
available while remote IO is interrupted - manual failover for example -
then we must supply a means of carrying out such remote administration, that
is guaranteed not to deadlock on a normal mode memory request.  This ends up
as a new network stack feature I think, and probably a theoretical one for
the time being since we don't actually know of any such mandatory login
that must be carried out while remote disk IO is suspended.

And the admin will be able to, but in the cluster stack itself we don't
bless such stupidity as emailing an admin to ask for a login in order to
break a tie over which node should take charge of DLM recovery.
