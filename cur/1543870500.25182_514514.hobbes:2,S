Yes, combining the two should do at least as well as either in
isolation. Are there videos of each of the two in isolation? Maybe that
would give someone insight into what's happening.

Oh dear. How do the other benchmarks look?

Exhibiting a workload where the list patch breaks down and the zone
patch rescues it might help if it's felt that the combination isn't as
good as lists in isolation. I'm sure one can be dredged up somewhere.
Either that or someone will eventually spot why the combination doesn't
get as many available maximally contiguous regions as the list patch.
By and large I'm happy to see anything go in that inches hugetlbfs
closer to a backward compatibility wrapper over ramfs.
