My understanding based on experience is that with a 2.4 kernel you will 
get a high load average burning audio, and the quickest fix is to use 
speed= to slow the burn.
With 2.6 you should get DMA using the ATAPI:/dev/hdX interface, and in 
fact I do see only a few percent CPU burning at 40x (max) and a lowly 
2.0GHz Celeron.
If none of this helps, do run "vmstat 1" to a file while running, and 
post your command line used to start the burn. You might try "ATA:" as 
well for comparison. I don't know if "-dummy" will allow you to test 
without actually burning or not.
