   I was trying to setup /dev/ttyS1 to 115200 baud.
   I was using "setserial", kernel 2.2.12 and FIC VA503+ motherboard with
   2x16550A integrated in 83877TF controller chip.
   After the approppriate "setserial" command I did
   cat /proc/tty/driver/serial
   And I saw there is 115200 baud set on /dev/ttyS1
Umm... I think you're confusing the setserial base_baud command with the
stty command, which is how you actually set the kernel speed.
You haven't given enough information about exactly what commands you
typed, but it surely sounds like pilot error on your part.  Probably
either (a) you changed the base_baud parameter to an incorrect value
(this is what's used to calculate the divisor; it should usually be set
toe 115200.   And, you have to use stty to actually set the baud rate.
My guess is that it's this step which you failed to do, since you also
didn't mention it in your e-mail message.  (i.e., "stty 115200 <
/dev/ttyS1").
