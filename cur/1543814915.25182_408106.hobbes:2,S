The codebase already seems identical to ondemand - Are your patches in 
2.6.16-rc6 or -mm? If they are - let me know which. If you posted them but 
they haven't yet made it into either -mm or mainline can you please post 
links to all your patches please? I can test them.
Why do we even have conservative and ondemand as two separate modules given 
they share huge amount of code - perhaps make conservative an optional 
behaviour of ondemand or alteast make a common lib which both use?
Thanks
