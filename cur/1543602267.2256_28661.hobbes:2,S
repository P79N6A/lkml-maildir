Subject: read() called twice for /proc files

Is there a general solution to the case of read() being called minimum
twice for a file in /proc?  I have a small file in /proc, whose data takes
a fair time to generate.  My read() handler gets called once for the data,
and once so I can return 0 to terminate read().
This results in the actual read taking twice as long.  Perhaps I am missing
something...
