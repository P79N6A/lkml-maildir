Today I friend and me got a bit curious about the default permissions 
of inodes in the procfs. By default they allow everybody to read the 
procfs of foreign processes. Some people might see this as a lack of 
privacy, since everybody logged in into the system can see the 
command line of their processes, indicating the tasks they're doing 
or worse, disclose actual data.
The question was if there were a way to prevent other people see the 
processes (or at least their command line arguments) with "ps aux" et 
al. The other question is of course if such a prevention would make 
sense at all. I argued, that at least those foreign processes should 
be visible that are parents of the process attempting to gather that 
information.
A quick "chmod -R og-rx /proc/*" showed, that this does the job for 
the currently running processes, but I doubt, that this is a sane 
solution.
Since there is no umask mount option for procfs there must be a 
sensefull reason for the "everybody may read others proc data" 
policy.
####
Another question, also on procfs is, where exactly does the race 
condition of the recently reported privilege escalation exploit does 
take place. In the few days I was experimenting a bit with the code, 
trying to inject non a.out formats, and eventually the Mono framework 
or the WINE wrapper could allow to inject code through a BINFMT_MISC 
handler, but I'm not through on this. Gladly the thing is fixed, but 
given the fact that there seem to be still a lot of servers on which 
even the sys_prctl exploit isn't fixed yet I'm a bit precarious about 
the whole situation.
####
Next question: I'm currently working on a binary format that is 
explicitly designed for the use in modularized, object oriented 
programs, kinda bit like CLI/.Net/Mono. The big difference is, that 
is focuses on normal "unmanaged" code. To use this format I had to 
write a wrapper - of course - that loads the modules, dereferences 
symbols and so on, you know the drill. However the module systems 
allows for extension of the loader mechanism, through a second level 
loader that is used for the major work in the whole system. However 
this second level loader must be bootstrapped by the wrapper upon 
program start - just like the Linux kernel gets bootstrapped. This 
results in 2 disjunct versions of the loader code being present in 
the running binary, of which the initial loader only takes away 
resources. My idea was, that the initial loader could somehow 
construct a fully functional binary in memory and then somehow 
replace its process code with the in memory binary. I wonder if there 
is such a possibility with the Linux kernel. Best thing I found so 
far was fexecve.
####
And last but not least: I wrote a little, no tiny is the better word,  
device driver for some gamma scintillation counter ADC hardware (GKH 
may remember me, writing him an email on the stable driver ABI issue, 
in which I mentioned this driver). That driver is simpler than SKULL 
in "Linux Device Drivers" and it has proven stable so far (20 
computers running 24/7 and putting data through the guts of the 
driver with a rate of up to 100k counts per second (each count 
triggers the IRQ and the IMHO a bit crude locking scheme). So far the 
systems are running stable and required no reboot since March 
(they're not connected to the internet and no foreign users have 
access to them, so no need to patch security issues).
Yet I'm concern that it might break something or I made something 
deliberately wrong, heck the last time I wrote kernel code was back 
in 2.4.1 times, I micht be a bit out of practice.
Is there the chance, that somebody might check the code for proper 
Linux coding style, not (just) in the way of source formatting but 
the splitting up of the source files, the use of include files (e.g. 
I put all IOCTL constants in a separate file with no source 
dependencies and can be included from both Linux kernel code and user 
space code without requiring includes "from the other world") and of 
course the way I'm doing things. I know that the locking scheme is 
very crude, but I'm quite sure, that the worst that can happen (if 
the spinlock mechanism is bugfree) is, that one sample might be read 
to small if a read from userspace is preempted by IRQ, and this read 
will increment exactly this sample; the probability for this is very 
small though: (2^12)^-2. However the samples are a histogram, and on 
the next readout (about 1/50sek later) the correct value will be 
there again. Accepting this little glitch saved me from implementing 
a lot of infrastructure (workqueues, dynamic ringbuffers - there 
might come in up to 100k IRQs per second, each only delivering one 
single data word to be fetched with inw). I'm just a bit uneasy on 
the whole thing.
####
Phew, I think that's it, I hope, that I'm not disturbing the kernel 
guys too much from their great work and that they might find a few 
moments to awnser me. Though I'm subscribed to the daily LKML digest 
I'd be gladfull if awnsers could also be CCed to my PM.
Thanks, and happy coding
