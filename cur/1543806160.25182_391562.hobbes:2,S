Hello!
>Why is the userland vblade server slower than the userland nbd-server?
maybe it yet is`t optimized for speed !?
nbd probably is more mature, too.
as of writing this, maybe the userspace vblade is meant for demonstration/testing/learning purpose. you wouldn`t buy a etherblade from coraid just for testing AoE - would you?
but, anyway - there is a second vblade implementation (independent from coraid) at  
http://lpk.com.price.ru/~lelik/AoE/
this one is done as a LKM and should be faster.
give it a try !
regards
roland
ps:
i did successfully boot a linux system with AoE-root (just like NFS-root) today !

Why is the userland vblade server slower than the userland nbd-server?
