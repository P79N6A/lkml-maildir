Oh, I'm sorry.  I have overlooked it.  There is no problem.

Okay, the probability that the process is blocked in the proc handler seems
to be small.  But I'm not sure if problems never occur in enterprise use.
So I'd like to use down_write_trylock() as Robin said before. And if it
fails to acquire the lock, it returns EBUSY immediately.
Do you have any comments?
Thanks,
