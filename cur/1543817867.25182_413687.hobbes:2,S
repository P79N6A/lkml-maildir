You're not.
There's nothing unstable about it.  The problem is that you didn't
schedule when you could have.  With Linux, this really isn't an issue,
but with the -rt kernel we concentrate on low latency, and by not
calling schedule when preempt count goes to zero and the need_resched
flag may be set, you may be delaying a high priority process
unnecessarily, for longer than needed.  This in the -rt kernel _is_ a
bug.
So for a stability point of view, that missed schedule wont crash the
kernel, but it might cause an xrun in JACK.
Now, sometimes a call to preempt_enable_no_resched is called just before
schedule is called, this is done so you don't have a double schedule.
For this, it is ok to call *_no_resched, but you need to flag that this
is ok by calling __preempt_enable_no_resched directly.
