I was thinking of local filesystems.  If some filesystem have ACLs very 
different from what we find useful in a generic VFS interface, then it 
cannot be integrated.  The VFS would then have to pass ACL operations to
the
fs driver unhandled, or the fs might need its own set of ACL tools
using ioctl.
