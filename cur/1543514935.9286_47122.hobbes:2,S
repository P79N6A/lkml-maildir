	Be careful there!  You do NOT want to raise the issue with the PTO!
Under their administrative rules, they can review the patent and only the
patent hold is allowed to present "evidence" and challengers are not
permitted any standing or any position to counter that evidence.  If they
"win" the review, which they often do, that fact is then admissible in court.
At least one individual was known to try and get people to challenge him
at the PTO knowing full well that he would lose in open court.  After winning
an administrative ruling, he then held the advantage in subsequent court
challenges and had an improve chance of winning at court.
	You are generally better off challenging a patent in court FIRST
before any PTO review.
