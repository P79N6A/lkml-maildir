I tried again with 2.4.30-rc3, but this time I changed my .config
file to disable 2 other modules that I didn't need, and wasn't loading.
< CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT=m
< CONFIG_USB_STV680=m
and build rc3.  It seems to work, so either my earlier
rc2 test with make clean wasn't clean-enough, or CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT
interferes - testing with CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT as a module (not loaded)
also works, so since interdiff didn't seem to highlite any difference 
between rc2 and rc3, I'll suspect that my test make clean didn't
clean things up good enough, and the entire problem was as
Adrian Bunk suggest (upgrade modutils, thanks Adrian)
