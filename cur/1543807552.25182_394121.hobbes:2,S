Well, you want the vmware.ko to contain machine code for at least 17
different architecture the kernel runs on? ;-)

written for a 2.4.x kernel, while I am running on 2.6.x.

While now, I don't need to install or rebuild anything, just use the
stock kernel which already contains the drivers :)

The same like what I do if I buy new hardware and no Linux driver exist
-- call myself an uninformed ignoramus, because that's who I am.

Doesn't this sentence apply to you as well? ;-)
				Have a nice fortnight
