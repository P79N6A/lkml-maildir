Greg,
Please pull these from "master" branch at:
        kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mchehab/v4l-dvb.git
It contains miscelaneous fixes, mostly related to kernel building and 
compatibility stuff. Also, one radio device were at the wrong place.
   - Videodev.h should be included also when V4L1_COMPAT is selected.
   - Fix V4L1 dependencies on compat_ioctl32
   - Fix V4L1 dependencies at drivers under sound/oss and sound/pci
   - Restore compat_ioctl in pwc driver
   - Fix a typo that caused some compat stuff to not work
   - Driver dsbr100 is a radio device, not a video one!
   - Fix minor errors in build files
   - Cx25840_read4 has wrong endianness.
   - Fix broken msp3400 module option 'standard'
   - Turn on the Low Noise Amplifier of the Samsung tuners.
   - Fix V4L1 Compat for VIDIOCGPICT ioctl
   - Quickcam_messenger compilation fix
   - Add several error checks to dst
   - Fix a warning on PPC64
Cheers,
Mauro.
