The xfs source files do:
#include <version.h>
To gain access to actual kernel release.
So each time you do a change to the tree that causes version.h to be
updated the xfs source files will be recompiled.
Note that version.h includes "UTS_NAME" - unfortunately.
So you will see version.h being updated rather often if you have enabled
the "Automatically append version information to the version string" in
the "General Setup" menu.
