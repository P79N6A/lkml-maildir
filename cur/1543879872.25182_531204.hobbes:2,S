I'm just a lowly proto-hacker trying to get into kernel development, but 
even I know a few things, and I'm getting very tired of hearing FUSE 
slammed as stupid and the Linux licencing policy as foolish. I can sum 
things up in two short passages.
FUSE is intended for end-users, not critical server applications. 
End-users have plenty of processor to spare at lower-than-ever prices. So 
you have a simple and flexible end-user API that lets you do anything with 
anything in any way you want, all the time, without needing to (or even 
needing to be able to) alter your kernel. Win.
Linux licencing basically says, "If you want in on this good thing, you 
have to play by the rules. That means no cheating, no scamming, no 
profiting at the expense of others, and no getting on a high horse and 
proclaiming to the rest of the world that you are in control of their 
destinies. Play nice, kiddies." If you want to do something, you do it 
open and you do it Free, and if you don't want to, well...write your own 
kernel!
There is a wonderful quotation on the GNU site comparing agencies like 
Microsoft to crack dealers: They appear more open in theory in order to 
get people hooked, then trigger the beartrap around your foot. Linux has 
rules--hard, fast, and immutable--and they protect everybody from their 
own stupidities. Open-community development takes a whole lot longer, but 
you don't have to sell your soul to do it.
