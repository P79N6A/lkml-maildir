Aiiii, that's good news.
I found a "Memhole" area. But I never used to change these items. 
Unfortunately, my TYAN board reference guide isn't telling me what to change 
there for good - so - can you tell me where to find more information about 
there?
If I remember correctly, it provided me the options ("Automatic"/"Manual") and 
a value list with the following items:
  64MB 128MB, 256MB, 512MB, 1024MB 2048MB, 3G, 3.5G.
and another list I can't remember by now.
but *playing* around with these values didn't help much (I just reduced my 
memory in linux down to 2GB once but didn't find the right values for getting 
4GB).
So, what should I do then?
Best reagrds,
Christian Parpart.
