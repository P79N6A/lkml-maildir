I could not parse this. Negation seems to be missing somewhere.

Ok, "memory failed before disk" is ... bad hardware.
...but... you seem to be saying that modern filesystems can damage
data even on "sane" hardware.
Lets define sane as:
1) if disk says sector was successfully written, it is so, until you
start writing to that sector again.
	(but disk may say "error writing". Filesystem should propagate
	that back to the userland, reliably. "Error writing" is
	extremely rare on modern disks, but can happen if you run out
	of spare blocks.)
	(and if you ask for sector write, sector is in undefined 
	state until drive returns success. Flashes behave like this
	-- reads return errors. Do disks?)
2) connection to the disk either works or fails totally. Bit errors
are reliably detected at connection level.
3) power may fail any time.
You seem to be saying that ext2/ext3 only work if these are met:
1) power may fail any time.
2) writes are always successful.
3) connection to the disk always works.
AFAICT it is unsafe to run ext2/ext3 on any media that can be removed
without unmounting (missing fsync error propagation), and it is unsafe
to run ext2/ext3 on any flash-based storage with block interface (SD
cards, flash sticks).

And thanks for that! Actually I'd be willing to pay some more
performance to get reliability up.

I was almost stupid enough to move primary copy of ~ and linux trees
to SD... I do have UPSes, unfortunately they are li-ion and i'm
running off them most of the time. I do have backups, but restoring
them all the time is boring & time consuming. I'll try to stick two
MMC cards into SD slot to make it RAID 1 :-).
