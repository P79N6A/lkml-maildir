Subject: x86: cr2 contents used as faulting address for alignment fault

Could anyone point me to whatever documentation/observations served for
using (starting with 2.4.x) the contents of cr2 as the address that
caused an alignment fault? A later, appearantly never applied patch
points out that this is at least not always correct (i.e. on Athlons),
and no official documentation suggests this would be valid at all.
Thanks, Jan
