Well, it can't get easier than that. My machine (CPQ Presario 3045US)
issues router requests for 0x60...0x63 for the 3 OHCI and 1 EHCI, and
without the patch USB does not come up not even if you start crying like a
baby. The patch also add the "stdroute" thingy that will enable future
cases like mine, to boot the kernel without requiring any other patches
(at least for pass thru router requests like the one I'm seeing here).
