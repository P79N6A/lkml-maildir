I found one maybe-drawback to this change :
When runing n+1 process (n = number of cpu), one takes one cpu, the other 2 
share another cpu. And, because of this patch, all processes stay in their 
own cpu, so one always has 100% of cpu power, the 2 others get 50% each.
In current implementation, one of the 2 processes from the same cpu would 
migrate to the other cpu, and so on, somehow sharing cpu time among them.
Is it a feature or a side effect of current implementation ?
I'll do some tests soon to see which version gives better performance at a 
higher level than just process migration cost - if different at all.
