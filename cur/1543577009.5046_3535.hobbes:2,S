Subject: [e2compr PATCH]: announcing beta port to kernel 2.2.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/1/1/42

Dear mailing list members,
     I am unable to join the maintainers/developers of the extended 2 
compressed filesystem patch at e2compr-announce@opensource.captech.com,
so I think you are the best available audience for this announce, and
I hope some of the developers/maintainers of e2compr will be listening
too.
I have uploaded at
http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~dicosmo/Linux/e2compr/e2compr-0.4.39-patch-2.2.18.bz2
a minor modification of the e2compr-0.4.38 kernel patch, adapted to compile
versus the latest 2.2.18 stable kernel. This was needed to allow us to upgrade
to a more recent kernel version in the next DemoLinux (see www.demolinux.org).
It seems to properly operate under reasonable charge for me,
even if once in a while I get a sequence of errors
       Whoops: end_buffer_io_async: async io complete on unlocked page
not necessarily when using ext2 compressed filesystems.
Please feel free to use it (at your own risk), test it and report bugs
to dicosmo@pps.jussieu.fr
Notice, though, that I am not applying to become an official maintainer
of the package: I just needed to spend some time to get it almost working
and I wanted to give back the contribution to the community.
Also, I am not currently subscribed to the kernel mailing list, so
please contact me directly by e-mail, for any comments.
Sincerely yours
--Roberto Di Cosmo
