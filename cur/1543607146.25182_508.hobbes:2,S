   mjes, the kernel module loader is nice, it's just
   that I know what hardware I have and like to build
   a kernel with what I need.
"arch/sparc64/defconfig" handles every onboard necessary device any
machine in my sparc64 collection has, and that kernel is under 3.5MB
It probably encompasses all the hardware you really need too :-)
Franks a lot,
