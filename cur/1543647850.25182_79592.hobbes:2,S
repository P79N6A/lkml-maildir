Hi Rob,
I have downloaded your latest patch and will use it to update the watchdog 
drivers. I'll be doing some additional cleanup and additions myself probably.
Now I'm still left with my original question: wouldn't it be easier if we
put all watchdog drivers in drivers/char/watchdog/ ?
Greetings,
Wim.
