I don't recall a time when quotas on ext3 were not deadlocky :(

read_dqblk() took dqio_sem, then ext3_dirty_inode() did journal_start().

ext3_sync_dquot() did journal_start(), then someone (commit_dqblk?) tried
to take dqio_sem.
Probably it is not too hard to flip the ordering in the latter case, but all
other code paths need to be checked, and perhaps even documented.
Jan, didn't we fix this very problem in 2.6 recently?
