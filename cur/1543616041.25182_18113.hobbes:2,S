Is it possible to decide, now what should go into 2.4.18 (maybe -pre3) -aa or 
-rmap?
Andrew Morten`s read-latency.patch is a clear winner for me, too.
What about 00_nanosleep-5 and bootmem?
The O(1) scheduler?
Maybe preemption? It is disengageable so nobody should be harmed but we get 
the chance for wider testing.
Any comments?
Thanks,
	Dieter
