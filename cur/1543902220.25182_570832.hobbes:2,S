You won't mess things up as long as the resuming kernel knows that it
should resume as if the system were shutdown, rather than sent to S4
state.  Maybe it is even possible to detect what type of resuming is
needed automatically.  Similarly, booting another OS shouldn't be a
problem, except that if you do it without powering off the system first,
some devices might not work under the other OS if the other OS doesn't
initialize them properly.
