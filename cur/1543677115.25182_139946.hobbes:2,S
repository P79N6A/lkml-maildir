If i have a hardware raid1 array of two 120 gig Maxtor DiamondMax 9 drives
on a 3ware 7000-2.  Failure of one disk should not go all the way up to
the OS and cause the OS to report hard errors, and remount the drive as
read-only, right?
My understanding of raid1 was that if there was a disk failure it would
note it, mark the drive as bad, and switch to running off the other drive.
Software raid on Linux does that.
This certainly isn't that!

I'll be out at the facility tomorrow to replace the dead drive(appears to
be unit #0), but am extremely curious why the 3ware unit did what it did!
I'm running a badblocks on the partition that was mounted readonly to see
if the filesystem is corrupted.(luckily it's all .tar files, so any
corruption will hopefully be easy to see.)
Running kernel 2.4.20 on Debian Stable.
