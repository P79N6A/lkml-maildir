It's not tricked, cdrecord should not care about device type. All it
needs to care about is SG_IO working or not.

Not sure I see any merrit in supporting that at all, but if so it would
be pretty easy to fake these.

It does, the 2.6 warning printed is just for CDROM devices.

What makes you say that Linux has a block-centric IO architecture? 2.6
block io layer is quite happy to do byte-granularity SCSI commands for
you.
