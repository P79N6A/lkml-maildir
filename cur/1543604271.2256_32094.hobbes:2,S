How does locking inside the kernel help you here ? You could face 
the same situation even if you protect the data by locking. 
Perhaps, I am missing something here. So, a specific example would help.

Only relevant issue I can see here is preemption - if you hold
a reference and get preempted out it is still a context switch
and the logic of "when the data can be really deleted" must take
into account such context switches. Alternatively, you could
disable preemption while traversing such lists.
