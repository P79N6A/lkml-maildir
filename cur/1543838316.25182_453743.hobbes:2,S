Subject: drivers/media/video/bt866.c: array overflows
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The Coverity checker spotted the following two array overflows:
<--  snip  -->
...
struct bt866 {
...
        unsigned char reg[128];
...
}
...
static int bt866_do_command(struct bt866 *encoder,
                        unsigned int cmd, void *arg)
{
...
                val = encoder->reg[0xdc];
...
                bt866_write(encoder, 0xdc, val);
...
}
...
static int bt866_write(struct bt866 *encoder,
                        unsigned char subaddr, unsigned char data)
{
...
        encoder->reg[subaddr] = data;
...
}
...
<--  snip  -->
The two bugs are obvious:
  0xdc = 220 >= 128

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
