Hi,
I updated the compile patch at 
http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/compile.diff
It is now about 62Kb, and tries to solve all bugs that can 
possibly prevent kernel 2.4.0-test5 to compile. There are currently only 5
known bugs left (see below). 
Greetings,
   Arjan van de Ven
Note 1:
	The "input.c" patch is still included as it solves the problem in
	a minimal way, and Linus didn't included the "major cleanup" patch
 	in test6pre yet.
Note 2: 
	The 5 remaining issues are:
	1) Miro radiocard pre-depends on ACI-mixer
	   strategy: will copy the 2.2.x "workaround"
	2) There is a bug wrt "modversions" and the sis fb
	   strategy: none; test6pre contains fixed for modversion bugs
	3) com20020-isa refers to non-existing member "clock" in a structure
	   strategy: unknown
	4) the Nintendo Parport joystickdriver has some sort of wrong 
	   dependancy on CONFIG_PARPORT
	   strategy: needs a careful check of the Config.in
	5) same as 4) but for the tgfx joystick
