Subject: [PATCH] mm: fix exit_mmap BUG() on a.out binary exit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/20/39

The problem was introduced by commit "mm: variable length argument
support" (b6a2fea39318e43fee84fa7b0b90d68bed92d2ba)
as it didn't update fs/binfmt_aout.c like other binfmt's.
I noticed that on alpha when accidentally launched old OSF/1
Acrobat Reader binary. Obviously, other architectures are affected
as well.
