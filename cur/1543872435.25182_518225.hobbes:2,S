Yes, that's what all my patches have been doing.

I think you should re-read my patches.
Previously, each task had N pointers, one for its container in each
potential hierarchy. The container_group concept means that each task
has 1 pointer, to a set of container pointers (one per hierarchy)
shared by all tasks that have exactly the same set of containers (in
the various different hierarchies).
It doesn't give task-level granularity of resource management (unless
you create a separate container for each task), it just gives a space
saving.

I think you need to give a more concrete example and use case of what
you're trying to propose here. I don't really see what advantage
you're getting.
