It's definitely in slab, in one of the loops walking the full, partial
and free chains.

I don't think that's the problem.  It really looks like a corrupted list.
How does this keep showing up in slab all the time?  Broken locking?
And also, looking at the prefetching in the list macros, it can have the
same effect as list_for_each_safe -- _if_ the compiler decides to save
the pointer it passed to prefetch().  In this case it didn't...
