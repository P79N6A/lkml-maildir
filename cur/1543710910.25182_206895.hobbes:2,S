Uh ? el3_eisa_probe looks like it properly returns an error...
Or maybe you call a failure not finding a proper device on the bus ?
When the driver registers, the bus may not have been probed yet
(built-in case). So un-registering the driver when it fails to find a
proper device is simply wrong with the current implementation.
In the meantime, 2.6.5-rc1 is broken WRT 3c579.
