Note that this would be solved very cleanly if the SHM code would use the
"VM_LOCKED" flag, and actually lock the pages in the VM, instead of trying
to lock them down for writepage().
That would mean that such a segment would still get swapped out when it is
not mapped anywhere, but I wonder if that semantic difference really
matters.
If the vma is marked VM_LOCKED, the VM subsystem will do the right thing
(the page will never get removed from the page tables, so it won't ever
make it into that back-and-forth bounce between the active and the
inactive lists).
