If I get time I will.  The patch still needs not only documentation but
also autoconf portability crud before GNU maintainers would want it.

And, in general, any time you want the file *gone* more than you want
it *unlinked*.  If you don't have write access to the directory, for
example, -T will at least truncate the file.
I thought about a companion flag to zero the file contents, for a
similar effect except that the file will no longer be accessible even
reading the raw block device.  Not a very strong security measure:
* Doing this probably won't remove *all* traces of your file; think FS
  journal, location before the last defrag, etc.
* There are a lot of ways to delete files that don't go through rm, and 
  some are easy to overlook.  One obvious example: Emacs unlinks foo~
  (without zeroing) before renaming foo to foo~ and writing a new foo
* The physical disk will still have traces of the old data on it so the
  NSA can probably still read it
With that in mind, does anyone else think this would be worthwhile?
