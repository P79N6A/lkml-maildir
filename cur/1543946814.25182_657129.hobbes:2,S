I did that yesterday and it just reported a kernel panic on the terminal
with the message:
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
There is a complete lock up.  Even the two leds don't send a dump in
morse code (if that is still a feature of the 2.6 kernels).  They just
flash together at 1 second intervals.
However, I do not have debugging enabled on 2.6.25-rc2 (I was just
interested to see how it worked).  If it is thought to be useful I can
recompile the kernel with debugging enabled, but this should be
reproducible by anyone with a rt73 stick.
By way of a further data point, I can scan OK using 2.6.25-rc2 and it
will report all the available access points in my area.  But as soon as
association is attempted, it blows up.
