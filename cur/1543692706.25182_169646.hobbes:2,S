Doesn't refusing to boot seem to heavy handed for this bug?  The buggy
CPUs have been around for many years (it is practically the entire AMD
line for the last 4 years or so), and nobody in userspace has
complained about the 2.4 behaviour so far.  (Linux 2.4 behaviour is,
of course, to ignore the errata).
ps. Why are we all saying errata - isn't erratum good enough? :)
