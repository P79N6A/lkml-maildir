I'll try it if the F-RTO option doesn't work. Might as well.
It might actually work; the problem at the moment is that as far as the kernel 
is concerned my usual uplink works at 10Mbit/s++ for a fraction of a second 
and then downright drops most of the rest of the data it's sent until the 
next burst. If I cap it sufficiently that it can't overflow either the line 
(on average) or my cable modem's buffers, that should work.
It makes sense.
Now, how come I didn't think of that myself?
