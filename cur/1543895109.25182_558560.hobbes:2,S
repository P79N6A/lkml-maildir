Huh?  Would you expect the *Free* *Software* Foundation to use the term
*Free* *Software* present in the license it wrote to mean what?

Heh.  That's hilarious.

You're mixing two separate issues.
One thing is the intent behind the writing of the license.  This is
what the spirit of the license is.
Another thing is how the copyright holder of a work perceived that
license, and the motivations for his choice of that license.  I don't
think this has a name.  Let's call this spirit of the licensing, for
the sake of the argument.
What I've been talking about is not the spirit of the licensing.  I
respect that, even when I don't agree with it.
But when people claim the GPL is changing its spirit, they're accusing
the FSF of changing the spirit of the license.  And this hasn't
happened.  This is the point I'm standing for.
Does this clarify the issue?

You mean I've done all of the above multiple times?  Show me?
Odds of success for the last one are pretty high, because the
discussion somehow sidetracked into that and I've probably been sloppy
about it, but as for the other points, I very much doubt it you'll
find me doing any of them.  100% sure you won't find anything about
forcing anyone to change to GPLv3.
I've just realized that "determine" above is ambiguous.  I meant it as
"decide", rather than "understand".  I was definitely trying to
understand their motivations, once the debate moved onto that front as
well.

Why, sure.  And given how close I am to the FSFs and how closely I
understand the reasoning behind the GPL, do you really think my view
does not match the intent of the FSF for the GPL?

How is this enough to adapt the software to my needs and run it for
any purpose?
How can you possibly claim they're not imposing restrictions on my
abilities to adapt the software to my needs (freedom #1) and run the
software for any purpose (freedom #0), if that's the whole point
behind their technical measures?

But it runs my home network, and you've connected to it.  Now what?
I'm sure I'm still missing something in your characterization of the
situation about networks, but I'm not sure I care enough to pursue
this point.  Feel free to drop it, I don't think it's relevant for the
discussion on whether GPLv3 changes the spirit of the GPL.

Not quite.  Copyright licenses are to be interpreted restrictively.
Unless it states you can do something, you can't.

Oh, but that's an option they have nevertheless.  GPLv3 or not.

I see you've moved away from the spirit and back to the legal terms.
My answer to this is: maybe.  There's no consensus about it.  And
then, I've never claimed it was.  I am not a lawyer to make such
claims.
What I've been trying to say is that disrespecting this freedom was
not in line with the spirit of the GPL, the spirit of respecting and
defending the 4 freedoms.  So, when GPLv3 adds provisions to make this
practice clearly not permitted, it's not changing the spirit.  And it
might not even be changing the legal effects in this regard.

You can.  I can appreciate that this isn't the point, but I don't see
what the point is that you were trying to make.
