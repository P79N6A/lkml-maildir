   Too bad it is 32bit nlink field in on disk format ;)
   
We're only talking about what the user is told is the
nlink value, not what you happen to compute and put/get
from disk.
Your nlink can be legitimately 128-bits if you want, it
still can be made to work :-)

   Ok, I think I will rework it to something sensible, because current code is
   somewhat a mess and corrupt correct nlink value on overflows. Hm.
   
Ok.
Franks a lot,
