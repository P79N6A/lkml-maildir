Yes, true.  Calm down ladies and gentlemen, and move away from the exits,
there is no fire.  While we're in here, do you have any idea what this is
about:
/*
 * We must not allow an anon page

 * the LRU, so we unlock the page after
 * taking the lru lock
 */
That is, what's scary about an anon page without buffers?
