Yes, you should use get_user_pages() instead if you access real memory.
If you try to find hardware mappings using that there is no ready
function for you right now, although I guess it could be added.
The function is also not quite correct, it should already least take
the page_table_lock (depending on where you call it from) and check
p*_none() on each level.
