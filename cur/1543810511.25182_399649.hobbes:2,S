I know positively that I've seen this with previous 2.6.16-<something>
kernels, but not sure which ones exactely. I just dismissed it as
something that would probably be fixed soon and then today when I
build a few test kernels I noticed it again and thought "ohh, so it
didn't get fixed, better report it".
I don't recall seeing it with 2.6.15 and earlier kernels, but I'm not
at all sure - especially since I only got this Athlon X2 box recently
and the first kernels I ever ran on it were 2.6.15-<something>.
