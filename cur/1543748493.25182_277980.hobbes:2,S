This could amount to a lot of data being passed from the kernel to user
space. To do a complete audit from user space you would need to provide
as much context from the kernel as possible.

hardlinks share the same inode.

Using inotify you can handle this. You watch /tmp for SUBFILE/SUBDIR
creations, and then when you see ultra_secret again, start watching it.
This is very racy though.

Inotify can provide a racy solution to this problem [see above]. I don't
know if it could be possible to provide an atomic solution to this
problem. Al Viro has lots of nasty things to say about providing any
kind of accurate view of the filesystem to user space.

Inotify could easily produce events for any part of the system. 
This being said, I don't think that inotify should be the solution.
Inotify was not designed with any of this in mind. A more generic
solution is needed and inotify could sit on top of it.

This is probably your best course of action. Later on we could merge
generic bits from this and inotify.
