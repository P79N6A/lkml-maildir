Same here during a halt of a RH 6.2 based K6-2 500 MHz
UP machine running lk240t13p3. The machine had been on
for a while and had built a kernel amongst other things.
Lead up was:
$ halt
.....
Sending all processes the KILL signal    [OK]
Turning off swap VM: __lru_cache_del, found unknown page ?!
kernel BUG at swap_state.c:78
....
