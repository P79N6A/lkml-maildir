Thanks for testing, but you forgot some numbers. ;)
(bonnie++? hdparm -i && hdparm -t...)
Because, I don't think that Maxtor HD's mechanics is faster than 100MB/s.. 
The only thing that can keep up with > 100MB/s are the few MB of Cache on every HDD... 
(so, does anyone have a good idea to check the HDD's cache performance?
hdparm -t reads too much data) 
I came up with something like:
"dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/null bs=4M count=1 iflag=direct"
and run it 10 times in a row.
here's a test run with a SATA I WD2500YD-01N ( hdparm -t performance: ~57MB/s)
