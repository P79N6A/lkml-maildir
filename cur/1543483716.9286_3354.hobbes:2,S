----
Note, when I ifconfig eth1, it is the same as eth0.  Automatically adding a
network route for both eth? devices is bad.
This is a setup actively in use at a site I maintain.  The upstream router
thinks it is talking to machines local to it, while the linux router is just
proxyarp'ing for them.  Ie, this is very similiar to a bridge.
