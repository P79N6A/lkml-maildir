Hi,
Generally I can't trigger it on one drive, but that could just be a
timing issue. All of these controllers are hosted on an Asus A7V
motherboard with the VIA chipset, and we've managed to make it fall over
much more rapidly by simply mixing firmware revisions between drives on
a single controller. 
The problem seems to track the WD2000JD-00F drives, and when one of
those drives is on the same controller as a WD2000JD-00G the whole thing
falls over in a couple of minutes.
As to the sectors that are failing, they don't seem to repeat and the
disk itself again reports fine. It also works fine on it's own after a
reboot. The chap who actually owns the hardware is going to run a test
under W2K to try and eliminate plain hardware issues.
Does anybody know whether there is a firmware update available for these
drives, as that seems to be the only difference here.
Cheers,
Eamonn
