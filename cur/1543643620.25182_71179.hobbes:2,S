Hi,
I'm not sure if kernel debugger issues are inappropriate on this 
list, but I'd think most of you would have used kgdb at one time 
or another.
I have a kgdb setup (kernel 2.4.18-5 patched with the 2.4.18 kgdb) 
and I'm debugging a module.   I notice that I can add break points,
and stop execution, however I'm not able to step into the code.
The module has been compiled with gdb symbols (-g).  I've used the 
loadmodule.sh script to load the module.  I'm using the gdb (5.2.1).
One thing to note though, is I'm debugging a DRM kernel module which 
resides it's own Xfree tree.  But it's a kernel module and I don't believe 
that should be the problem.
Any thoughts?  What am I missing?  I'd appreciate any suggestions!
Please CC your replies as I'm not subscribed to the list. 
Thanks,
Bhavana
