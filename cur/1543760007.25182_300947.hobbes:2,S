Without that pointer there is no information in the timer_list struct as
to where the timer is/was running since base is set to NULL when the timer
function is executed.

There is no easy way to distinguish the case that a timer was deleted
from the case that the timer function is running (which may reschedule
the periodic timer). A scan over all the bases is required to insure that
the timer function is not being executed right now.
If we only would sync when we deleted the timer (meaning timer->base was
!= NULL) then we would not synchronize when the timer function
is executing (and therefore timer->base == NULL). However, we need to sync
exactly in that case because a periodic timer may set timer->base again
when scheduling the next event. That is the main stated purpose of
del_timer_sync.
