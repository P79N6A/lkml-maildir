That's where the stuff I want put in is.

PaX sits currently at 2.6.7 (and grsec is tied to PaX quite deeply, so
it sits there as well), so there's no using that for now past 2.6.7.
I've heard rumors of it getting some up-porting after a new component is
properly done (recall my assertions about having to chose between
chasing mainline and doing real work), but it's up to the PaX Team if
they want to do that or if they're just going to wait for a fork 2.6/2.7.
