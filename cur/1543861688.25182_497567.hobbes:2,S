Good point. I'll add it for next time.

Bind mounts are a purely VFS level construct. Unionfs is, as the name
implies, a filesystem. Last year at OLS, it seemed that a lot of people
agreed that unioning is neither purely a fs construct, nor purely a vfs
construct.
I'm using Unionfs (and ecryptfs) as guinea pigs to make linux fs stacking
friendly - a topic to be discussed at LSF in about a month.
