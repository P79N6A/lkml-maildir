You did not live through the horror that was FORTRAN IV, I learned
programming in it (no structure except DO, a primitive for). Sure, Pascal
strictures are overkill, but in a sense they were needed to implant a bit
of structure into the mess that usually came before.

And you do break structure only when necessary, so the dosis of Pascal did
