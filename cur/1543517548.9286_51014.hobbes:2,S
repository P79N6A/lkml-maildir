I can do this, although it will mean renaming all the uses of the semid_ds
and shmid_ds structures to something like kernel_semid_ds,
kernel_shmid_ds, etc. (my proposed change would make semid_ds and shmid_ds
private to the kernel, as msg_queue and shmid_kernel are now)
What about something like this (in include/linux/sem.h):
/* this defines user_semid_ds and old_user_semid_ds */
#include <asm/sem.h>
#ifdef __KERNEL__
struct semid_ds {
	struct ipc_perm	sem_perm;
	time_t		sem_otime;
	time_t		sem_ctime;
	struct sem	*sem_base;
	struct sem_queue *sem_pending;
	struct sem_queue **sem_pending_last;
	struct sem_undo	*undo;
	unsigned long	sem_nsems;
};
#else
/* Make libc5 happy for compiles */
#define semid_ds	old_user_semid_ds
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */

Already done.
