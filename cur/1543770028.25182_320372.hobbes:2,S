No. The pci_bus resource pointers are just pointers to _some_ resources
and generally aren't tied to particular pci device. For example, the
root pci buses often don't even have corresponding bus->self structure,
and bus resources are pointers to global io[mem,port]_resource.
And definitely we must not touch resource layout in struct pci_dev -
it's defined by pci specs.

Increasing the size of pci_bus by 8 or 16 bytes shouldn't be a problem -
I don't think embedded machines have a lot of pci buses. :-)
Anyway, the default PCI_BUS_NUM_RESOURCES value can be overridden in 
arch specific headers.
