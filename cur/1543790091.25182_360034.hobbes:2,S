Ok, I'll update Rob's patch to the latest tree and send it on (I hadn't 
seen it yet when I wrote my version).

I agree, I thought it was necessary since I hadn't looked at 
dmi_check_system and didn't know if it had a return value I could check.  
Rob's patch looks much simpler and nicer.

Having it all in the driver probably makes the most sense if we have to 
have code there anyway.  Otherwise future users may have to check both 
places if things break again in another configuration.

Checks against the compiler defined arch are usually wrong since users 
could be cross compiling, and I'd like to avoid an ifdef altogether.  I 
think we can make the code collapse entirely by fixing linux/dmi.h.  If 
we remove the !defined(CONFIG_X86_64) check around the extern of 
dmi_check_system, all other arches will have it defined to simply return 
0, causing gcc to remove the dead conditional in ohci1394.c.
Anyway, I'll refresh that patch, test it, and send it on to Andrew, 
hopefully tonight.
Thanks,
Jesse
