It'll work without adjusting the min_free_kbytes at all. The 16MB free had
better results after fragmentation stress tests but this was a few percent
of memory when allocating as huge pages as opposed to it falling apart. The
success rates were still way way higher than the vanilla kernel.

I don't have a sample workload that has reasonable amount of higher order
allocations over longer period of time. When the next -mm comes out, SLUB will
be able to use high-order pages so I'll boot my machine with less memory to
pressure it more. Assuming the kernel boots on my desktop machine, I should
get some idea of what its long-term behaviour looks like.
