Yes that is basically what we do on ia64 but we use different
terminology.
time = ns_at_last_tick + (hw_value - last_tick_hw_value) * scale >> shift

I sure hope that we will be doing that. But so far this has been
a new implementation instead otherwise ntp_scale would not be in the
gettimeofday function.
