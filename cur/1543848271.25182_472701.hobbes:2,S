Subject: [patch] rearrange kioctx and aio_ring_info
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patch is result of our kernel data latency analysis on a
large database setup (128 logical CPU, 1 TB memory, a couple thousand
disks). The analysis is done at an individual cache line level through
hardware performance monitor unit.  What we did essentially is to collect
data access latency on every kernel memory address and look for top 50
longest average access latency.  The hardware performance unit also keeps
track of instruction address for each collected data access.  This allows
us to further associate each of the top 50 cache lines to instruction
sequences that caused long latency.
One structure stood out in the woods is the AIO kioctx structure.  In
particular, kioctx->users and kioctx->ctx_lock are the two hottest variables
within one cache line (there are multiple of these cache lines since db
app uses multiple kioctx). What also appears to be a more serious cacheline
conflict between io_submit_one and aio_complete path: aio_complete()
finishes process an iocb, unlocks ctx->ctx_lock (which implies it just lost
ownership of that cache line), turns around and access wait->task_list and
also does an atomic update to ctx->users.  I think that is causing cache
lines to be bounced around when another process took the ctx_lock in between.
So here we go, I'd like to take this opportunity to rearrange kioctx, put
variables that used together in close proximity.  The rearrangement doesn't
change number of cache line touched in io_submit_one or io_getevents, however,
it reduces one line in aio_complete path.  Also I think we ought to watch
out on updating variable that is in the same cache line of ctx_lock.
Thoughts?  Comments?  Flames?
