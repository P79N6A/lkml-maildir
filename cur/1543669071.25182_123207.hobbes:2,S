With the current setup though, the memory is wasted.  It makes sense that we 
should fill the memory up with *something* that is likely to be useful.
If I have mozilla open, start a kernel compile, and then come back half an hour 
later, I would like to see the mozilla pages speculatively loaded back into memory.
Since the system is otherwise idle, it doesn't cost anything to do this.  I 
think its obvious that it is beneficial to swap in something, the only trick is 
getting a decent heuristic as to what it should be.
