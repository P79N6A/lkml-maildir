almost one year ago I've did similar work. Even split it in small pieces.
Even encouraged some subsystem maintainers to do some movements in this
direction (greg kh, actually).
Even running my own patched kernel with this patches in on my production
servers for a months without single hang or reboot.
Even have 2.4 bk tree (way outdated, but patches are in). Even can publish it.

After a couple of attempts to attend people who make decisions to that issue
I've stopped doing that, just almost like Keith Owens with his kbuild 2.5

I don't think even sed with simple s/// can misplace set_current_state into
something unrelated (if it is not buggy sed ;)
And with bitkeeper (or other tool that can do colored diff representation)
it will be even simplier.
