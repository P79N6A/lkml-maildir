strace-3.1-3.  The -f option does not work for a normal user under
2.2.4.  It gets
PTRACE_ATTACH: Operation not permitted
Too late?
It works for root under 2.2.4, it works without -f for a normal user
under 2.2.4, it works for everybody with or without -f on 2.2.3.  For a
normal user doing -f on 2.2.4 it hangs shortly after fork and there is
no sign of the child in the trace.
