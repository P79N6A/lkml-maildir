I am at a loss of how thinkpad-acpi could in any way cause, or change, the
firmware wake-up notification behaviour.
That said, my T43 with 2.6.21 and latest-of-the-latest thinkpad-acpi wakes
up from S3 just fine by pressing the "Fn" key and holding it down for ~2s.
I didn't know it did that :-)  I always use the power button.
