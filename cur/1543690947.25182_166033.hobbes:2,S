Huh?
[ralf@dea linux-ci]$ grep -r __flush_cache_all drivers/scsi
[ralf@dea linux-ci]$ head Makefile
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
SUBLEVEL = 0
EXTRAVERSION = -test5
You probably get this reference to __flush_cache_all() via the Sparc64
<asm/cacheflush.h>.  Still the cacheflushing in the driver is broken;
the routines in <asm/cacheflush.h> are meant only to maintain cache
coherency wrt. memory managment.
