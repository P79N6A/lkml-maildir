Perhaps you misunderstood the problem. The problem is that the timer 
module can be unloaded with a timer running. The solution is not to 
silently stop the timer and allow the module to be unloaded, having a 
timer running is, in a sense, a ref, and the ref count can and should 
reflect that.
If the admin wants to stop the timer there are tools to do that now, 
then the module can be removed.
I'm generally against the Windows approach of "do you really want to do 
that?" paranoia about letting the user do certain things, but locking in 
the module if I have started a timer sounds like a good safety precaution.
