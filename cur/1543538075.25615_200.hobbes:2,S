I don't run stock binaries either, but most people do. Compilation flags
and most version skew won't ordinarily affect the placement of buffers in
stack frames anyway, so this at most buys you a tiny bit of extra security.
And adding a patch to the mainstream kernel so people like us are safe
(even if it was so in this case, which I very much doubt) while hurting
everybody else for nothing should not be an option. Ever.
