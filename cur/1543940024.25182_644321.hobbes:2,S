thanks, applied.

hm, include/asm-x86/linkage.h?
btw., i guess this in include/linux/linkage.h:
#ifndef __ALIGN
#define __ALIGN         .align 4,0x90
#define __ALIGN_STR     ".align 4,0x90"
#endif
is an x86-ism (0x90 is the x86 NOP instruction) that should move into 
include/asm-x86/linkge.h and the default filler should be 0x00 instead?
