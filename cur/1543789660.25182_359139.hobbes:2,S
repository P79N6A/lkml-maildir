In principle, if you open a file, write to it, close it, have
somebody else open it, read it, close it, then delete it, it
probably will never touch a physical disk. This is the basic
way a VFS (virtual file system) works. The system maintains a
RAM Disk that overflows to the physical media.
Given that, there are various ways to provoke the system into
writing data to the disk(s), such as executing `sync`. However,
normally file-data are written when the kernel needs to free
up some memory or when the disk(s) are un-mounted.
