True, but at block time you have more information. If a process blocks on
pipe read, presumably it's in the pipe read code that the process is
blocked, and that code is not common to disk read, keyboard read, socket
read, etc. Atleast not all of it is...
If you try to do something at unblock, you have to determine why the
process blocked. But if you do it at block time you have that information.
Therefore you should have a lot less overhead to add, which is why I think
it's a win over finding "what happened?" at unblock.
