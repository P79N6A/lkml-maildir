There are several options:
1) write a kernel-level driver for this device; with the new hid bus 
   inftrastructure in place, this is quite easy. This has the advantage 
   that once the driver gets merged, all the users with new kernel will 
   have the driver automatically available
2) unbind the driver from the device via sysfs. libusb should have API for 
   this as well, usb_detach_kernel_driver_np() if I remember correctly
