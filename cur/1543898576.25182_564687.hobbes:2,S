No the old driver doesn't even do that. It starts up. It spuriously
adjusts some non writable PCI BAR registers, prints a message about
resources being in use already then exits.
I had a poke around the setup. As far as I can observe we break even if
the ROM timing values are used as is. I suspect documentation or a good
deal of luck is needed.
