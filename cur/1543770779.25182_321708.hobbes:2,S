Hello,
We have acquired some IBM xServers which have an integrated raid controller
based on the Adaptec AIC-79xx U320 SCSI controller (called HostRaid).
Is there already support for HostRaid? Are there drivers for it?
From which kernel version and where do I find it in the config?
I would really appreciate any help.
Thanks in advance,
Clemente
