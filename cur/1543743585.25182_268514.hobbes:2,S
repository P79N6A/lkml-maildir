Bart, Chris's two patches are OK with me.  If you agree, then please 
merge them up into your ide-2.6 queue.
Chris, a useful follow-up patch (if Bart agrees) is a global 
search-n-replace of WIN_xxx constants with ATA_CMD_xxx constants. 
Depending on the size of the patch, it might even need to be split up 
across several patches.
