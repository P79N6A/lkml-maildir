 What about to list "safe" filesystems anywhere in /proc/fs/ ? I think
 it's very important information for admins.
 Note, your patch for mount(8) is always trying to use unprivileged
 mount(2) for non-root users. It's overkill when unprivileged mounts are
 supported for bind mounts and fuse only. It would be nice to check
 if FS is "safe" before switch to unprivileged mode.
 The "safe" definition is also very subjective and it depends on your
 level of paranoia. There should be a way (e.g. /proc) how control and
 modify the list of "safe" filesystems. For example I have no problem
 to mark cifs as "safe" for my home server.
