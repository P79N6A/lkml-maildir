Yes, because Linux programmers are only one who care about quality. 
Microsoft happilly offers (W2k DDK,inc/ddk/ntddk.h)
/* PLIST_ENTRY RemoveHeadList(PLIST_ENTRY ListHead) */
#define RemoveHeadList(ListHead) \
	(ListHead)->Flink;\
	{RemoveEntryList((ListHead)->Flink)}
and they do not care that you cannot use it in an expression, or
after if () statement, or anywhere else, except directly in an
assignment which is not in if/while body. So you must know that
RemoveHeadList() is macro, even that it is macro built from two
statements, and that you cannot use it as a function at all, as
it has a value only from left side - from right side it is
void :-( And of course it evaluates ListHead two times.
Please do not add such traps into Linux kernel code.
