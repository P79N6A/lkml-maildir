If __UID16 works, then renaming it to CONFIG_UID16_ONLY _must_ also work. 
I don't understand your argument about other architectures. I'm claiming 
that __UID16 is a config option, and that it must be renamed to _show_ 
that it is a config option.
If the renaming results in code that doesn't work, then the code didn't 
work in the first place or your cpp is incredibly broken.
WE MUST NOT HAVE CONFIG OPTIONS THAT ARE HIDDEN AND CALLED __UID16! That's 
my whole point.
