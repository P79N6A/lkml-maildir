Aha!  I believe this is the reason it was failing.  If I allocate the
maximum
possible amount of memory I'll need in the beginning when nothing else
is going on, it works.  But if I allocate it as I need it, it runs for a
while until
there is a lot of I/O and then kmalloc returns NULL.  I'll try adding a
spinlock
around the kmalloc so it can't call it while other stuff is going on.

I actually only need it in 136 byte chunks, the only place I got 8k from was
that's
about how much had been allocated total when kmalloc started failing.  But I
think it's probably due to reading/writing from it during allocation.
Regarding Andrea Arcangelli's suggestion of using __get_free_pages(), 
should I still use kmalloc if I can get it to work, or is there another
reason
to use __get_free_pages?  Given the choice, I'd rather stick with kmalloc
since it allows smaller chunks to be allocated at a time.  Thanks both for
your help,
