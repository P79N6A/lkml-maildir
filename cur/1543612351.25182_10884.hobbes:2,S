There are 2 ways to add a computer into the stream (besides sniffing), you
can set up a bridge, it is forwarding packets without having to have a own
ip address and without the need of reconfiguration. Of course you can use a
router to do the same, it just needs routing table modifications.
If you want to look at the data stream on an application on a (TCP) socket
level, you can use the transproxy function of linux kernel. It will redirect
a connection which is done through a router to any local process. Those
local process then can contact the original destination, having effectively
beeing a man in the middle. There are a lot of tools out there to do this.
You may want to tell us, what you are trying to do.
