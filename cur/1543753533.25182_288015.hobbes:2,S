Okay, more verbose then. On your machine which is running kernel version
x you build kernel version y. You grab the version y kernel source tree,
let's say a vendor tree, which has meaningful default configurations in
arch/$ARCH/defconfig. The runnig kernel's configuration may also work
for that kernel source tree, or it may not.
The user does a ``make menuconfig'', and expects to see sane defaults.
What kconfig really does is take the running kernel's configuration
instead. This is a ad choice; it makes much more sense to take
arch/$ARCH/defconfig.

You assume that the user is already running the kind of kernel he is
trying to produce. Al least to me this assumption seems weird. Instead
my proposal is to use a different make target if you actually do want to
clone the running kernel's configuration, but this shouldn't be the
default.

I'm not trying to add more magic, I'm trying to get magic taken out,
because nothing guarantees that taking the running kernel's
configuration makes sense. The kernel packages we ship have meaningful
default configurations on all architectures that allow this. You won't
end up with a highly optimized configuration for your particular
machine, but nothing guarantees that you will end up in a better state
with the running kernel's config.
