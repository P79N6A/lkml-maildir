As I mentioned earlier, cse decided the two rdtsc asms computed the same
value and eliminated the redundant computation.  This behavior from CSE is
incorrect since the two rdtsc asms were separated by one or more volatile
asms.
It turns out that reload_cse has the same bug.
I just checked in a fix for this bug into the egcs development sources to
fix both instances of this bug.
Thanks,
jeff
