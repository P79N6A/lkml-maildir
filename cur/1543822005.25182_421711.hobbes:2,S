OK, glad you agree.

Yes. And preferably have checks in the generic page allocator setup
code, so we can do something sane if the arch code gets it wrong.

Yes. Depends whether we fold it under the HOLES_IN_ZONE config. I guess
HOLES_IN_ZONE is potentially quite a bit more expensive than the plain
zone check, so having 2 config options may not be unreasonable.
Also, if the architecture doesn't align the ends of zones, *and* they are
not adjacent to another zone, they need either CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE or
they need to provide dummy 'struct page's that never have PageBuddy set.

Great!
