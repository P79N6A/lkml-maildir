Neither should be in the name.
Again, people, look how we already do this in the kernel today with the
hwmon drivers.  They all just document the units and that's it.  No
problems.

Ok, that's fine with me.

Well, what do the tiny battery-driven devices of today provide (like the
Nokia 770, other cell phones, smart hand-helds, etc.)  Those should give
you a good idea if that would be needed or not.
