Is this SMP? If so, how many processors? I wonder if you might be
running into some lock contention in the pool entropy transfer -
there's a lock held while mixing new samples into a given pool that
could potentially be a hit.
Beyond that, there are a couple small multiples that can be squeezed
out of the extraction path for a total of 5-10x.

Indeed you are.
