with one partition you MAY have to seek across the disk to get from one
file to another (depends on the optimization of the filesystem)
with multiple partitions you WILL have to seek across the disk becouse
files on one partition are forrced by your partitioning to be on a
seperate part of the drive.
if all your access it to the same file it won't matter how you are
partitioned, but if you read a file from one filesystem, put intermediate
results in /tmp, then put the final result back on the first filesystem
you will end up doing a LOT of seeking between the partitions.
I am not saying that a single partition is nessasarily faster, but I am
saying that multiple partitions are not a definante win, and under some
conditions can be a significant loss.
it's like filesystem type, you need to look at what you are doing and plan
accordingly.
