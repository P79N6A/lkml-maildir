Yes, it works. There is only problem with VMware - I wrote patch
which disables LVTPC NMI delivery when running VMware (like 
LVT0/1 NMI delivery is disabled on normal SMP/IOAPIC kernel (as VMware
uses its own address space when running emulation, it does not want 
NMI delivery during switching address spaces)) and I found that after 
I reenable delivery, nothing happens :-( Performance counters aparently
just delivery interrupt only for one cycle when counter value is 
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF. And apparently setting delivery mode to edge triggered 
does not work for LVTPC (or maybe that disabling LVTPC delivery just causes
all events to be dropped, even in edgemode). So first time when VMware 
runs when NMI should be triggered, you lost it. And as next come after 
2^48 CPU clocks, it disables NMI watchdog almost forever (it is not 
problem on ia32, as 2^32 cycles passes in few seconds after you exit 
from VMware).
As workaround, I tried to program LVTPC as fixed delivery to 2, but this
caused 'invalid vector received' error :-( So for now UP K7 NMI watchdog 
and vmware are incompatible. Maybe I should try to revector it for
SMI delivery, because of SMI handler runs in its own address space. But it
is incompatible with APM and ACPI, so...
