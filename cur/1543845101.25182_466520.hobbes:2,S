Yes. I mean kernel crash handler. Yes all the contents are present
in the vmcore file. It is just a matter of somebody reading vmcore
and walk through either the page tables or may be vmlist and export
these mappings through ELF headers so that gdb can read it.

Agreed. AFAIK, crash does not display the function params and local
variables. gdb has got this advantage, though last time I looked
at local variables dispalyed by gdb, they seemed to be junk. Not very
sure why it was so?

I beg to differ here. Not sure why it is easier to optimize gdb. If we
try to optimize gdb by writing scripts, then IMHO, writing C program
is easier and faster. If the idea is to optimize gdb by modifying gdb
code then its no different than crash. In fact, why to reinvent the 
wheel if crash already does so many things for us. Yes, but probably we
need to modify crash to be able to obtain function parameters and local
variables.

Displaying even the currently non executing threads using "info threads"
and their backtraces is interesting. Crash can already do that. I am 
apprehensive about traversing through the task list and dumping every
thread's register state after a crash. There is no gurantee that list
is in a sane state. And in general, we are trying to make crash handler
as small as possible to improve the reliability of dumping operation.
Register state of every non-executing thread is already present in the
vmcore and IMHO, we should write scripts to get info about other
threads then doing it in kernel.
