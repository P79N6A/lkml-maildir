The code migrates on the first correctable error on a page, so "excessive"
is one.  Yes, keeping a per page count gets problematic, especially as
memories get larger.  The issue of the right metric for when to migrate
will always be debatable and the "right" answer likely will depend on
the physical memory technology.

The actual migration code is generic, in mm/migrate.c.
The ia64 kernel module piece is very arch specific.  It ties into the 
ia64 CPE handler.  It gets the page address from the CPE record, based
on the ia64 error handling spec.  Each arch will have a different way of
determining the physical address of the correctable error (for example).

CONFIG_IA64_CPE_MIGRATE=m builds it as module.
CONFIG_IA64_CPE_MIGRATE=y builds it as part of the kernel.
