Why would you want to unconditionally enable this interrupt?
And how do you set the alarm time?
I implmemented Wake-on-alarm for the ACPI suspend case. The way I did it
was to implement a procfs handler that set the alarm time and enabled the
interrupt. I fantasized about porting it to the RTC procfs handler, but I
never got around to it. The ACPI list archives should have more info/clues
about it..
But, I don't think this should be enabled by default.
