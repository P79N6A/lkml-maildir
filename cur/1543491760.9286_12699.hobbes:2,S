The docs are a bit obsolete. The point is that lp knows nothing about the
I/O port number, but instead it uses parport to do the call to the
hardware layer. So lp is attacched to parport and if parport0 is 0x378
(likely to happen if it's the only parallel port in the system) lp0 will
gets attached to parport0 and so to 0x378. You can change the lp behavior
using some kernel param (see the top of drivers/char/lp.c).
