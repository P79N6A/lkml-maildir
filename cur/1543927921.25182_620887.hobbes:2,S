It is disabled since when I abandoned the lm_sensors approach; I 
remember that I did some more testing with lm_sensors and got almost all 
chips identified, although didn't know how to use lm_sensors to generate 
some useful logs.
I agree with you that we have to simplify the system down.
Note: when I built kernel 2.6.24-rc3 to see if it is still affected by 
bug #9147, CONFIG_HWMON was enabled instead (and the problem was 
verified anyway). I don't recall how that setting got enabled, however I 
did not enable it manually and I was not enabling lm_sensors support.
