Most hypervisors let guest account in virtual time because this requires no 
code change. We had that in the past as well. But now we have lots of 
customers that rely on a different accounting model. Before 
CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING we got this model of top showing 99% of cpu used, 
even if the hypervisor gives us 20% of the physical one.  We actually want to 
show that this process gets only 19.8% of a real cpu for several reasons:
- people do workload management based on used cycles
- people/departments pay money based on used cycles
- If your physical cpu has to much load, you want to identify processes by 
physical cpu usage
There are even some vendors that claimed that Linux accouting was completely 
broken and useless on s390 and people should use their vendor tool to get the 
right numbers. While these tools still have important features 
CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING fixed at least the "broken" parts.
