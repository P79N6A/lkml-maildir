We're getting someplace now.  If you question the ability of the platform
to make reliable tools such as perl, why do you think you'll have good
binutils and gcc on the platform?  If your platform doesn't have dlopen()
working then yes, python2 will probably be pissed off.  I conceeded this
last time too I think.  If you're trying to bring up a platform
compiling a kernel is a good test of having lots of things working.  With
2.6 it'll mean one more thing is at least somewhat working, dlopen().  Or
you can go and make a CML2 interp in C.  Or sh.  I'm quite happy cross
compiling stuff until things get a bit farther along on a brand spanking new
platform.
