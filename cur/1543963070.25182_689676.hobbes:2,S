Right. I should have added "path" parameter rather than adding a new hook.
But to avoid touching vfs_*(), I moved security_path_create() to
the callers of vfs_create().

Sorry. I didn't know security_dentry_open() is available.
Now, security_path_open() and security_path_uselib() have gone away.
But it also turned out that security_dentry_open() is too late for
checking open(O_CREAT) and open(O_TRUNC) cases. Thus, somehow,
I want to check O_CREAT before entering vfs_create() and
check O_TRUNC before entering do_truncate() from may_open().
Regards.
