Hi all,
    I've started migrating my new firewlls over to the 2.4.x kernels.
    In 2.2.x my general firewalling scripts had the following line:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_always_defrag
    This proc option appears to be missing in 2.4.x.  Had it been replaced
by something else or is it not needed anymore?
