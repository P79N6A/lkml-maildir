ah, here we go
BUG(); line 907 of mm/slab.c
name == "size-32"
in_interrupt() is an undefined symbol in this context, so I don't know 
whether we are in interrupt context or not, if indeed that is what this 
is
no symbol BYTES_PER_WORD, but size == 32
MAX_OBJ_ORDER and PAGE_SIZE are unknown symbols in this context
dtor appears to be 0, and it looks like it should be set to something
offset == 0 and it looks like it should be < 0 or > size
in kmem_cache_create from kmem_cache_sizes_init at mm/slab.c:616
