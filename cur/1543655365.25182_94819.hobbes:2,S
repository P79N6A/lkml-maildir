But someone could. When you implement POSIX message queues you have to
follow the standard and not write something similar to it.
Even if you mention in docs that your mqueues aren't strictly POSIX,
someone can miss it and end up with hard to explain "bug" in his program.
BTW as your implementation will act randomly I can't see how you will
handle multiple readers (maybe except some trivial cases).
