If I understood correctly, it is posible to call platform's probe
callback without previously calling platform_device_add_data() to setup
platform_data.
But actually I failed to find any user of this platform driver in
vanilla kernel, so it is hard to say if driver is used properly or not
by external modules, and thus this change is very likely valid.
