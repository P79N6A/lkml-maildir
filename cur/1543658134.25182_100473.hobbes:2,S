Very true. And if they don't want to support the beta kernel, that's 
there choice. I'd rather them throw a driver in for people that use the 
beta kernel for possibly testing new chipsets, know whether or not they 
need to do revisions before their own driver can be released, and so 
when the beta kernel is finally released that they'll have a driver 
right then to provide.
The impression I am getting from the GPL argument is that people want 
100% opensource drivers. Well, to be frank, I'd rather have a driver 
that isn't 100% opensource to no driver at all. I think most everyone on 
this mailing list agrees. If not, I'd like to know why.
Personally, I think Andre does a lot of good for the kernel. I don't 
know of many desktop systems that don't use IDE. Without someone like 
Andre to keep up support as well as he does, IMO a lot of people would 
get left unsupported and end up not using Linux. Less Linux users means 
less demand for Linux support from mainstream developers and hardware 
companies. People want a name to be able to communicate to when they are 
having issues. Some will find their way to this mailing list, but others 
will look for something that has (or has better) support.
