Hello,
I just tried 2.4.22-pre3 and found out I cannot boot my test box any more. It
halts at:
reiserfs: found format "3.6" with standard journal
on a partition located on aic7xxx based hd. 
Booting the box with pre2 works perfectly well.
Anything I should try? What information is needed?
Regards,
Stephan
