Subject: question on using kiobuf stuff

I'm working on porting our filesystem +
device-masquerading-as-filesystem to use kiobufs. I seem to have run
into a deadlock when trying to use map_user_kiobuf from in my nopage
function: do_page_fault() (arch/i386/mm/fault.c:140) takes a
down(&mm->mmap_sem), and then map_user_kiobuf() (mm/memory.c:~461)
also takes it. If I understand semaphores correctly, they sleep on
the second+ calls to down(), so I have a deadlock situation here.
So, what is the best way to work around this? Should I modify the
kiobuf stuff to determine if the semaphore is already taken (how)? 
Write my own variant? re-architect the code (probably major work)?
thanks for any help!
