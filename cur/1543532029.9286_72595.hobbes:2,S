   No you don't;  just follow the same logic that exists for a stack
   overrunning the stack limit: out of limit ::= program fall down go
   boom.  For an assurance that the program won't go down and fall boom
   for that reason, you can go out of your way to preallocate.

   david parsons \bi/ The only place where overcommit is really really useful
                  \/  is the emacs editing a 100mb file case, and maybe vfork
		      + page ownership would be a better solution there.
