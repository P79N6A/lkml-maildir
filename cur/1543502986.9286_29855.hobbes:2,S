As far as I've got is this:
If I detach from a simple program before it calls exit, nothing goes
wrong.
If I let it exit, everything starts to break.
By 'break', I mean that when processes (unrelated to gdb) execve they get
sent SIGTRAP, even though they aren't PF_PTRACED.  But it isn't coming
from the obvious place in binfmt_elf.c, and in fact when
do_load_elf_binary exits, current->signal is 0.
Starting from a freshly-booted system I can do this:
[tim@cocobean tim]$ gdb

(gdb) file sleep
Reading symbols from sleep...(no debugging symbols found)...done.
(gdb) set args 1
(gdb) run
Starting program: /bin/sleep 1
Program exited normally.
(gdb)
[1]+  Stopped                 gdb
[tim@cocobean tim]$ ls
Trace/breakpoint trap
I.e., at this point, things have started breaking.
[tim@cocobean tim]$ fg
gdb
(gdb) run
Starting program: /bin/sleep 1
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x4000b191 in ?? ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x40001790 in ?? ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x4000b191 in ?? () from /lib/ld-linux.so.2
(gdb) c
Continuing.
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
0x4000b191 in ?? () from /lib/ld-linux.so.2
(gdb) c
Continuing.
(1 second pause)
Program exited normally.
(gdb)
So the 4 SIGTRAPs (and there are always 4) get sent before the execve, but
afterwards there are none.
Any ideas, anyone?
Tim.
