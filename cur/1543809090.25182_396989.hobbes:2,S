 Hi Mark,
 This patch does indeed seem to fix this particular problem. Now creating and 
deleting files/directories gives expected results across nodes.
 The bad news is that it didn't last long. While doing some more tests I found 
another problem, but judging from kernel messages I think this one is related 
to the DLM code.
 The test was simple: 
 On node 1 untar a kernel tree and wait for tar to finish.
 After tar finished I ran tar on nodes 0 and 2, each one *concurrently* 
creating a separate archive from *the same* kernel tree untarred on node 1.
 Again, since the files are big, I've put them online:
Node0:
http://coyote.ist.utl.pt/ocfs2/Feb14/kern-iscsi-teste.log
Node1:
http://coyote.ist.utl.pt/ocfs2/Feb14/kern-orateste1.log
 (this node's clock was 10 minutes off, sorry about that)
Node2:
http://coyote.ist.utl.pt/ocfs2/Feb14/kern-orateste2.log
 On node 0, tar exited with:
tar: 
build-AMD-linux-2.6.16-rc2-git3-jbdfix1/drivers/media/video/cx25840/cx25840-core.c: 
Cannot stat: Invalid argument
On node 2, tar exited with a segmentation fault.
Anyway, after that I am still able to read and write files on all three nodes 
with consistency.
Any ideas?
Thanks
Best regards
Claudio
