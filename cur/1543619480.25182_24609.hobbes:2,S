No you are wrong. This array is supposed to provide a readahead setting 
on the driver level, which is bogous, since
it's something that *should* not be exposed to the upper layers at all. 
Please note as well that
 we have already max_readahead in struut block_device as well. Please 
note that this array only has
a granularity of major block device numbers which is compleatly bogous 
for example for a disk and
cd-rom hanging on a IDE interface. And so on and so on... It's really 
better to let it go.
