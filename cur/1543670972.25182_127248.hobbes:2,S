The requirement that things like ls, find, cp and so on know where to look
for these things trumps any "purity of labels" arguments.
In addition, a case can be made that different modules *should* use the
same name - because that way when you're re-labelling a file system for
a new security module, you can actually *detect* old crufty conflicting
labels added by some previous module.
"Warning: file %s was already labelled with attribute %s"
If you do as Chris suggests, you can't implement this in a clean manner.
