Both my process's are 32-bit process's, its just one runs on 64-bit
machine and other runs on 32-bit machine. The write from address
0xffffe0000 to a file on a 32-bit machine fails, but does'nt fail on
64-bit machine (the process is still 32-bit although it runs on
64-bit).
How can the virtual address of   0xffffffffff600000 exist in a 32-bit
process ? (May be I have not made myself clear in explaining the
problem?? :-?)
Best,
Vamsi.
