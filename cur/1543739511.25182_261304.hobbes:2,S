Subject: [PATCH 0/8] replacing/fixing printk with pr_debug/pr_info in arch/i386 - intro
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello, I'm going to post a series of small janitorial patches focused on
1) replacing DPRINTK-style macros with pr_debug from kernel.h
2) replacing printk(KERN_INFO ...) with pr_info(...)
3) fixing _obvious_ inconsistencies of printk levels as:
printk(KERN_INFO "Start... ");
...
printk("Ok!\n");
The patches fix only obvious inconsistencies: seems that there has been
no policy about how a subsystem should print boot/log messages
(subsistem prefix, etc.) nor about the difference between printk(...)
and printk(KERN_WARNING ...), etc. So I did not touch those issues.
The patches regard (mainly) files in arch/i386/kernel.
The patches are based upon 2.6.9-rc4.
The patches have been compile and boot tested.
One file one patch.
Any comment is very welcome.
CC'ed to Ingo Molnar, hoping that's appropriate.
Bye
Daniele Pizzoni <auouo@tin.it>
