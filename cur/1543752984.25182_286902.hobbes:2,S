I always ASSUMED it was something wrong with my userspace because
I was only seeing this problem on one of the boxen running 2.4 that I have, I
upgraded modutils but the problem didn't vanish. Since none of the modules
which failed depmod -a were important for me I guessed there was some
other part of the ancient Rh6.1 install that was too old...
Unfortunately, I only use that machine every few months and can't test
anything :)
