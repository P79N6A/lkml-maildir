Dear All,
    I use Red Hat 8.0 and kernel 2.4.18-14, which come from redhat
distribution. I want create a NFS-root kernel to build a diskless linux
using NFS root. I select "IP kernel level configuration-> BOOTP, DHCP",
NFS root support. I boot client using my kernel, it does not requrest for
an IP address. It try to mount NFS root immediately. Do I forget
something?
Thanks,
Theewara
