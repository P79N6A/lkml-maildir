Make system is a bit broken in the sense that it recompiles and links right after
a build even if nothing changed.
I have 
# CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO is not set
make output after a fully built tree:
{ // these are expected off course 
GEN /usr0/export/dev/bharrosh/git/pub/linux-2.6-block/.build_i386/Makefile
CHK include/linux/version.h
CHK include/linux/utsrelease.h
Using /usr0/export/dev/bharrosh/git/pub/linux-2.6-block as source for kernel
CALL /usr0/export/dev/bharrosh/git/pub/linux-2.6-block/scripts/checksyscalls.sh
CHK include/linux/compile.h
}
{ // these cause a recompilation and relink
AS arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall-int80_32.o
AS arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall-sysenter_32.o
SYSCALL arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall-syms.o
SYSCALL arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall-int80_32.so
SYSCALL arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall-sysenter_32.so
AS arch/x86/kernel/vsyscall_32.o
}
LD arch/x86/kernel/built-in.o
GEN .version
...
CC init/version.o
LD init/built-in.o
LD .tmp_vmlinux1
KSYM .tmp_kallsyms1.S
AS .tmp_kallsyms1.o
LD .tmp_vmlinux2
KSYM .tmp_kallsyms2.S
AS .tmp_kallsyms2.o
LD .tmp_vmlinux3
KSYM .tmp_kallsyms3.S

LD vmlinux.o
MODPOST vmlinux.o

I'm cross compiling on an x86_64 fedora7 machine. with
make ARCH=i386 KBUILD_OUTPUT=.build_i386 allmodconfig
and
make ARCH=i386 KBUILD_OUTPUT=.build_i386
Other wise after an mrproper all is well and booting
and the dir structure looks much better
Thanks
Boaz
