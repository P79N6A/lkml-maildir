I've been thinking a bit about replacing the mapping and index members
in struct page with a single pointer that point into a cluster data
type. The cluster data type is aligned to a power of two and contains
a header that is shared between all pages within the cluster. The
header contains a base index and mapping. The rest of the cluster is
an array of pfn:s that point back to the actual page.
The cluster can be seen as a leaf node in the inode radix tree.
Contiguous pages in inode space are kept together in the cluster - not
physically contiguous pages. The cluster pointer in struct page is
used together with alignment to determine the address of the cluster
header and the real index (alignment + base index).
Anyway, what has all this to do with memory resource management? It
should be possible to add a per-cluster container pointer in the
header. This way the per-page overhead is fairly small - all depending
on the cluster size of course.
