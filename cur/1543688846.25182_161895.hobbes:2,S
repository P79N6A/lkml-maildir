As you probably know the 68020 had an external MMU (68551, or Sun-3 or Apollo
MMU). Probably Motorola didn't bother to change the behavior when the MMU got
integrated in later generations (68030 and up).
BTW, probably you want us to run your test program on other m68k boxes? Mine
got a 68040, that leaves us with:
  - 68020+68551
  - 68020+Sun-3 MMU
  - 68030
  - 68060
For linux-m68k: You can find the test program source in Jamie's original
posting on lkml. For your convenience, I put a binary for m68k at
http://home.tvd.be/cr26864/Linux/m68k/jamie_test.gz.
 Just tell us the
program's output and give us a copy of your /proc/cpuinfo. Thanks!

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
