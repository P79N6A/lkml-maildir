Why we are giving so big importance to root processes? Yes, they are
important, but they are even more likely to flood our memory, because
limits don't apply to them. I propose to just divide their badness
by 2, not by 4.
I also propose to half badness of processes with pid < 1000 - those
processes are usually also important, because they are called during
boot-time and they usually handle important system affairs. And
because most of them are run by root, the previous behaviour will
be restored, but with giving less badness to some non-root important
processes, and more badness to later-run root processes, which are
often less important.
