Maybe I'm missing something here, but if the problem is resource
allocation when switching from state A to state B, and from B to C,
etc.; wouldn't it be a bad thing if state B happened to be (in the
future) this state-shifting userspace daemon of which you speak? (Or
is that likely to be impossible/unlikely for some other reason which
alludes me at the moment?)
