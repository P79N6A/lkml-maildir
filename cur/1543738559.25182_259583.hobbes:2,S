suspend: Allocating pagedir failed.
swsusp: Restoring Highmem
this happened right now, after running fine over the weekend and doing a
successful suspend/resume cycle this morning.
It was a "battery critical" suspend, so this is not nice :-( I had about
2 minutes left until hard powerdown during which i tried to get it to
suspend but failed. Yes, userspace should handle the "failed
battery-critical suspend" case better and probably call "shutdown -h now".
