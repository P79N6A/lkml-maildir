I've recently started using 3.2 for testing and it seems, thus far, so
worse than 2.95.x and appears to have fewer bugs in some regards
(i.e. don't seem to go bonkers with register pressure form long long).
At some point, 2.95.x might be considered too old and gcc 3.2+ with
have to be the minimum --- is this time near?
What about MIPS and Sparc64 --- are they still using ancient
compilers?
