patch
Hi,
Here is updated dontdiff file that makes life easier for those who use
simplistic approach when working on linux kernel, i.e. have two copies
(rather than links) - one clean and another "work in progress" and do:
diff -urN -X dontdiff linux work > work-bla-bla.patch
A copy of the dontdiff file (uptodate with 2.3.30+kdb) is on:
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/dontdiff
Enjoy,
