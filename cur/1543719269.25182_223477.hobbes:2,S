I've applied it, but I tried to simplify the code, because it seemed
unnecessarily hairy to me.  I hope I didn't break anything.
I'll release 2.1.99-test4 in a hour, so please check it once again.

I would vote for keeping it in pciutils and copying it to <linux/pci.h>
when it will be needed by any kernel drivers.
				Have a nice fortnight
