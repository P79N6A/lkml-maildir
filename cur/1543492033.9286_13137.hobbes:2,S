Maybe... One possible source may be fat_get_entry() usage (much more
active now than it was in the old version). And fat_get_entry() does a lot
of unnecessary buffer cache activity. I'll try to clean it up. Something
is definitely wrong with buffer cache handling. Sometimes unlinked files
linger for a while.
