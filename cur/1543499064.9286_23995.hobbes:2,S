   I have a mail spool drive w/ corrupted super-block
   and don't know how to recovery the data. 
How did it get corrupted?  That's actually important for trying to
figure out how to fix it.
   Tried "e2fsck -b <8192*[1-20]+1> /dev/sdb1" and same "bad
   magic number " error.
Are you sure the partition table didn't get fried, or that something the
beginning of the partition got changed?  If so that would explain the
symptoms that you've described.
