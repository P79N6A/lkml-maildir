So now we'll have _3_ different implementations of exporting
the OFW device tree via procfs.  Your's, the proc_devtree
of powerpc, and sparc's /proc/openprom
That doesn't make any sense to me, having 3 ways of doing the same
exact thing and making no attempt to share code at all.
If you want to do something new that consolidates everything, with the
goal of deprecating the existing stuff, that's great!  But with they
way you're doing this, all the sparc and powerpc implementations
really can't take advantage of it.
Am I the only person who sees something very wrong with this?
