The way I know it you must first of all build the nvagp modules
downloadable from nVidia's web site and use those instead of agpgart.
However, the snafu is that you must have an nVidia video card to go
along with it (or use the on-chipset crap video card.) So you're SOL i
think, at least until nvidia gets a bit less selfish.
