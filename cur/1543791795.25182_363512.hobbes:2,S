Well, I finally get evidence that my mainboard is a "K7N2 Delta-ILSR" 
not a "K7N2 Delta-L" (from the shipping package, the invoice, and online 
review of the two motherboards). So the BIOS version 7.4 is a valid one. 
I updated the BIOS to the version 7.8. Now the drift is low and ntpd 
happy (me too), all that without the "noapic" option.
Strange is that the kernel log is almost the same but this little 
difference:

The following message is still here:
talla kernel: ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
talla kernel: ..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=0 pin2=-1
But all work fine with the latest BIOS.
For me the issue is solved. A lot of thanks to all peoples that helped 
to this thread with special mention for John Stultz. I hope that the 
others that have the same problem can solve it the same way.
Best regards,
