Preventing anyone from using the module is incorrect.
How will you handle the case when you have only one algo registered and
it will be exclusively used by ecryptfs?
Herbert proposes to register _second_ algo (say aes-generic(prio_100)
and aes_for_ecryptfs(prio_1)) with lower prio, so generic access will
never try to catch aes_for_ecryptfs, but your code still can access it
using full name.
