Absolutely correct Paul.  Fixed now.
But I've also another problem, amanda barfed again last night, about 
90% done, leaving:
[amanda@coyote root]$ ps -ea|grep amandad
 3126 ?        00:00:00 amandad
 3128 ?        00:00:00 amandad <defunct>
still present, and it missed several of the larger dle's due to data 
timeouts after amandad went on strike.  I can kill them, but even if 
I do, an 'amcheck Daily' returns this:
[amanda@coyote root]$ amcheck Daily

Now, I had shut down an smb mounted box in the basement about 2:25 am, 
and that got this in the logs:

and this last message continues for another megabyte or so till now.
And the only way I know how to fix this is to reboot to a good kernel, 
2.6.10 apparently has a problem with amanda and samba that earlier 
kernels don't have.  I had 8 days of uptime with Ingo Molnars last 
realtime patch, so guess what I'll be running till this gets fixed...
I've no idea why samba is mucking with amanda, if indeed thats the 
problem, that machine is not part of amanda's backup configuration in 
any way, shape or form.
And, still booted to 2.6.10, I have a script in my init.d dir just 
like the smb one but it starts & stops my local samba shares.
--------
[root@coyote root]# service asmb restart
Stopping share gene:
Stopping share dlds:
stopping share shop:
umount: /mnt/shop: device is busy
umount: /mnt/shop: device is busy
Starting share gene:
Starting share dlds:
Starting share shop:
Could not resolve mount point /mnt/shop
[root@coyote root]# ls /mnt/shop
ls: /mnt/shop: Input/output error
[root@coyote root]#
-------------
So whatever has been done to the kernels smb code in 2.6.10, has 
managed to break that too.  If I reboot to 2.6.10, it will work 
again, for maybe 24 hours, 28 hours is the longest uptime I've 
managed so far, but problems start popping up at about 20-21 hours.
I did try the CIFS code for one build, but its apparently incompatible 
with an older samba on the other two machines of my local network.
