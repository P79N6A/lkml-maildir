A thin layer - no.  To get merged, a driver would have to
be of good quality.  I didn't think like that - I was thinking of
embedded developers that sometimes implement the
entire embedded application inside their device driver.
Which is crazy from a linux design standpoint, but sometimes
reasonable for an embedded developer when the sole purpose of
the embedded computer is to control the single "device" and
perhaps a little display with a couple of buttons.
The "app" part might not be that much
bigger than the device driver itself - it is then tempting to
cut some corners and put all in one place.
Of course this kind of "driver" ends up containing everything,
and nobody wants to GPL that.  Separating driver and app(s)
properly lets them keep a proprietary app, and a driver or two
that might be small and simple enough to be released.

Good point.  Fortunately, most devices are much simpler than
a card with accelerated 3D-graphichs.
