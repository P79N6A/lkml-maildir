I think the preferred way of waiting for the IO system and kswapd to catch up
is blk_congestion_wait().  Because it waits for the "right" amount of time.
I'll make that change.
And yes, the name is silly: "what if it's not block-backed"?  It hasn't
caused any problems yet, but maybe one day we'll need to find a way for
network-backed filesystems to deliver a wakeup to sleepers there.
