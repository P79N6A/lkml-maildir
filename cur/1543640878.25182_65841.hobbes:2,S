The problem is that most cell phones, if they don't have a keyboard 
themselves, only have 16 keys (0 through 9, *, #, cancel, menu, up/down). 
My cellphonish pocket terminal got its own space-cadet derived keyboard, 
works well. But I don't really thing you'll cope w/only 16 keys.
Otherwise proceed the ugly way it is. 0 through 9 have their usual 
meaning, all the multicodes, menu is say return, C is esc, up/down - well, 
ok, and * and # have any meaning. I see no better way.
