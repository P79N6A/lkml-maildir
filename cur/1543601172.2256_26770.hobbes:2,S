They are bad if it's hardware-related. The big one is manufactured in Hungary, 
the other one in Thaiwan.
The error occured again.
I post the new errors. Maybe you can see any structure in it.

Only syslog related files are concerned.
syslog is configured that it will accept logs from other machines. Maybe there's 
a possibility that these strange errors were caused by the network-card or 
-driver ? I own an eepro100. Just a thought...
These errors occured since 2.4.5 that's why I think it's software-related.
I'll try to use 'hdparm -d1 -X33 /dev/hda' and other modes to see if it occurs 
again. But testing could take some time. It appears ~~ every second day.
