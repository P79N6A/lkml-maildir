I cannot comment, I have no inside knowledge of it.

There is a flaw in this argument. If I am told that mount --bind does just
about what I want to have as a feature then these applictions must have the
same problems already (if I mount braindead). So an implementation in fs cannot
do any _additional_ damage to these applications, or not?
My saying is not "I want to have hardlinks for creating a big mess of loops
inside my filesystems". Your view simply drops the fact that there are more
possibilities to create and use hardlinks without any loops...
