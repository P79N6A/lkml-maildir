You may have a chicken and egg problem :) I don't think anybody will
rule on this unless there is at least a demand for it. For there to
be a demand for it I think you'd need to come up with a rigorous
specification, wouldn't you? And then implement it even.
Unfortunately this is just how kernel development goes if you're brave
enough to try out new things.
I'm leaning toward the opinion that the entire problem would be better
handled purely with the existing RT scheduling classes, and a good way
to handle the security side of things.

This sort of thing is pretty well specialised enough that it doesn't
belong in the kernel scheduler, however. Often it can be satisfied by
userspace managers... but you'd have to be talking about a hard RT
system anyway, which Linux isn't.
