Hi,
	you can find at 
http://bulma.lug.net/static/
 a few new benchmarks among
Reiser, XFS and Ext2 (also one with JFS).
This time there is a comprehensive Hans' Mongo benchmarks
(
http://bulma.lug.net/static/mongo/
 )and a couple of kernel compilations and
read/write/fsync operations tests (I was very careful of populating the
cache before the measures for the last two cases).
Regards,
