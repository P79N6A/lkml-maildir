this should be irq_list->irq
other than that seems to work here on a type2 model:
sonypi: Sony Programmable I/O Controller Driver v1.26.
sonypi: trying irq 11
input: Sony Vaio Jogdial as /class/input/input8
input: Sony Vaio Keys as /class/input/input9
sonypi: detected type2 model, verbose = 1, fnkeyinit = off, camera = off, compat = off, mask = 0xffffffff, useinput = on, acpi = on
sonypi: enabled at irq=11, port1=0x1080, port2=0x1084
sonypi: device allocated minor is 63
sonypi: unknown event port1=0x0f,port2=0x05
Oh, there seems to be a spurious interrupt happening at modules
insertion (I suspect sonypi_enable triggering and ignoring it), but this
happens with the old module too and I never noticed it before. Wouldn't
make more sense to print the warning even if verbose=0 to be able to
catch it timely? I mean it's since 2.4 times I don't enable verbose mode
in sonypi...
