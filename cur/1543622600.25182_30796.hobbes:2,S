Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.5-dj1, small fix in drivers/input/gameport/Config.in
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While looking through the Config.in files in 2.5.5-dj1 for missing
help texts in Config.help, I found that in drivers/input/gameport
we have both CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1 and CONFIG_INPUT_EMU10K1,
and perhaps only one of these is needed.
Here is a snippet from the drivers/input/gameport/Makefile:
obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_CS614X)   += cs614x.o
obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1)  += emu10k1-gp.o
obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_FM801)    += fm801-gp.o
There is no help text for CONFIG_INPUT_EMU10K1, but there is
one for CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1 in drivers/input/gameport/Config.help.
However, drivers/input/gameport/Config.in prompts for a setting for
CONFIG_INPUT_EMU10K1.
The following micro-patch is proposed:
