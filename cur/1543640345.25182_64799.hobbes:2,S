2.4.19-preempt
All bets are off because who knows what preempt is doing to the state
machines and in PIO you are dead.
You can not delay transaction of data between interrupts w/o having the
transport help out.  But the preempt don't get it.
If you push your request size down to 8k or to a page you preempt problems
will go away, only because granularity of requests.  And the price is
performance goes in the tank.  But this is preempt so who cares.
Cheers,
