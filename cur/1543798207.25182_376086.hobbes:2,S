I didn't realize there ever was a bugzilla number for it.
This is the actual patch, which Linus put into his tree on 30th August:

Subject: [PATCH] Lazy page table copies in fork()
X-Git-Tag: v2.6.14-rc1
X-Git-Url: 
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=d992895ba2b27cf5adf1ba0ad6d27662adc54c5e
[PATCH] Lazy page table copies in fork()
Defer copying of ptes until fault time when it is possible to reconstruct
the pte from backing store. Idea from Andi Kleen and Nick Piggin.
Thanks to input from Rik van Riel and Linus and to Hugh for correcting
my blundering.
Ray Fucillo <fucillo@intersystems.com> reports:
  "I applied this latest patch to a 2.6.12 kernel and found that it does
   resolve the problem.  Prior to the patch on this machine, I was
   seeing about 23ms spent in fork for ever 100MB of shared memory
   segment.
   After applying the patch, fork is taking about 1ms regardless of the
   shared memory size."
