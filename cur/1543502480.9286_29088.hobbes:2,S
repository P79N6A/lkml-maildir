MIDI is going to have those problems until you've got millisecond
accuracy.  More so if you're triggering sounds close together to get
fake reverb effects.  Really the sending of MIDI events should be timed
and handled by the sound driver, not the app.  (My humble opinion).
However dynamically synthesised sound done in software works very well
even at 20Hz or so.  That gets you about 50ms of lag between decision
and sound but the real world is just like that so it sounds great.  Of
course your advanced mixer/synthesiser engine will time the actual start
of each sample _within_ each audio fragment to the sample point, won't
it?  Well mine did :-)

gettimeofday() works pretty well and portably for the busy waiting part.
Linux used to have problems with it being not monotonic, and jumps and
so on.  Never mind.
Busy waiting is a waste of good CPU time though -- which you could be
using for a background audio mix or even AIs if you're clever.

No you don't -- set all syscalls restarteable by flagging the signals to
do that: see sigaction() and SA_RESTART.
Timers have pretty coarse granularity though for much the same reason as
select().  Signal delivery is traditionally thought of as quite slow --
I have a nagging feeling that select() is known to give more accurate
timeouts than timer signals on many systems.

Don't worry about the delta time.  It's not perfect, but gettimeofday()
followed immediately by select() is a good approximation.  Not good
enough for hard RT, but in practice it's always good enough.

Yes I think at very least you should be able to wait approx. 10ms, and
not have 20ms be the enforced minimum.

The select() man page is a bit optimistic here methinks.  It's always
been the case that (a) there's a timeout then (b) process is woken and
goes on run queue and then (c) eventually gets a timeslice.

Go check out the UTIME patch to see that *no* busy waiting is necessary,
in principle (on systems that can do utime):
  
http://hegel.ittc.ukans.edu/projects/utime/
In practice that would amount to treating a utime-d kernel as one having
a very short tick.  You still want to run well on other kernels and
other systems after all.

Take a look at the Pentium local APIC sometime.  I haven't looked but
I've been told it does have a high-resolution local timer than can issue
interrupts.
Actually my wish list is starting to include: suspend individual
interrupt sources for X ticks.  For batching input from network packet
drivers.
