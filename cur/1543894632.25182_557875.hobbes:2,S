Which would only have effect on future additions, not the current
content of the file - of course.
Now - what if someone would write a patch for such a file (that was
'any version' before and then had a header added saying 'just version 2')
under the license 'version 2 or later'? This patch could be transformed
to 'just 2', and then applied to said source file - but, it could also
be added to the previous version of that file (without the new header)
as 'version 2 or later'.  Hence, the file can still be constructed at
any moment (provided the header is removed) as license 'version 2 or
later', UNLESS someone adds a *crucial* patch (that cannot be removed
as well, along with the header) that is explicitely made version 2
ONLY by its author.
Bottom line - adding a header to those files with "version 2 only"
by Linus is pointless.
