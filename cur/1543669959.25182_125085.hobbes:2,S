Good point. My two (weak) arguments for the new variable are:
- A fixes-only tree is imo different from any other patchset and
should be marked as such. 2.4.20.2 sounds more official than
2.4.20-jb2. Whether this should be underscored for the developers as
well - not sure.
- It makes things like 2.4.20.1-je1 easier. But then again, someone
will come up with 2.4.21-pre7-ac1-je2-something_else5-even_more.
Sound a little too weak for the extra variable. Could have been a sign
that I lost the patch.
