I have had a similar problem with a repeating SCSI error that didn't clear
until reboot.  I'm running stock 2.2.10 (not vger) on a PowerCenter - also the
53c94.  In my case, I tried to mount a blank CD on my panasonic cw-7502 cdr
drive.
I suspect we're seeing a slightly more generic problem in changeable media,
not just MO.
