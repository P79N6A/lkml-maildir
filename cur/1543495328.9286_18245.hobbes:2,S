Subject: [question] minix_unlink() is weird or am I stupid?

Hi brethren,
In fs/minix/namei.c:minix_unlink() there is a section of code that looks
like this (with my comments):
repeat:
        retval = -ENOENT;
        inode = NULL;
        bh = minix_find_entry(dir, dentry->d_name.name,
                              dentry->d_name.len, &de);
        if (!bh)
                goto end_unlink;
        inode = dentry->d_inode;
        retval = -EPERM;
        if (de->inode != inode->i_ino) {  /* call this ifA */
                brelse(bh);
                current->counter = 0;
                schedule();
                goto repeat;
        }
        if (de->inode != inode->i_ino) { /* call this ifB */
                retval = -ENOENT;
                goto end_unlink;
        }
I don't understand this code. More specifically, how can the code inside
ifB ever be executed? If de->inode != inode->i_ino  on the first
round then when we are scheduled again we would continue on "repeat"
label, call minix_find_entry() again (which may cause io so we might fall
asleep there too) and so on. To my (unarmed) eyes if de->inode is ever !=
inode->i_ino the code inside ifB will never be executed but loop until
de->inode == inode->i_ino.
Btw, it is not just an academical interest but I am implementing the
unlink() method for some other filesystem and use minix as a perfect
example of how to write a Linux fs. (ext2 is too complex to serve as a
standard). So your help would be very appreciated.
Regards,
Tigran.
