Just to clarify here, I suggested a linux-commits style list (patches
Linus has applied) and Alan suggested a linux-patches list (patches
submitted to Linus.)
I like the cset diffs because I can see patches Linus has applied that
weren't posted.  If a linux-patches list is created (and people use it)
then a commits list isn't as useful.
