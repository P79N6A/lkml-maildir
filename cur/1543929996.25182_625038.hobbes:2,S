hm, yeah, drat.
What we could do is
- in do_IRQ(): set up a per-cpu pointer to some counter which
  corresponds to this IRQ.
- in the page allocator, if in_irq(), retrieve that per-cpu pointer and
  increment the counter.
- in the network block-io stack we can now look at the number of
  interrupts, number of packets, size of packets and amount of memory
  allocated and work out the max amount of memory which needs to be
  allocated for each frame.
That's all rather handwavy and misses a lot of details and might be
inaccurate too.  Probably sufficient to just work out by hand the amount of
memory which the network stack will need to allocate.  I expect it'll be
two pages..
