from serio_suspend. It is normal device, not a sysdev, AFAICT.

from late_initcall().

I'd not expect TSC instability detection to be ran while system is
suspending, plus "wrong for 500msec" is still wrong.
Plus TSC unstable detection is heuristic that can easily go wrong, right?

Apart from OLPC, which machines have working TSC?
Anything that has cpufreq does not.
Anything that enters C2 does not.
Anything that is SMP does not.
So, how many machines do you have with working TSC?
