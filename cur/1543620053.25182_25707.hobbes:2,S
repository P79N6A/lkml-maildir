Ok, you're right.  We want to tell the drivers to shut down (remember,
the original goal of driverfs was for power management), so all drivers
that attach to a device need to be shown.
I'll play with the code some more and make this kind of change.

Heh, I took the "preliminary" tag off of it a short while ago, as so
many different userspace programs were using it.  Maybe usbfs2? :)
Seriously, I've had some ideas of a different way to implement the
functionality of usbfs, possibly without all of the ioctl calls, but I
have not had the time to experiment with it...
