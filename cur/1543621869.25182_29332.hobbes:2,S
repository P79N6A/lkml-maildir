Ok, if you see problems starting with 2.4.8, can you narrow it down to which
2.4.8pre kernel starts the problem also?

The community isn't too keen on giving free support for non-free (ie, closed
source) drivers.  Maybe after you have found the exact pre kernel that
starts exhibiting the problems, there might be someone willing to help.
Compile some -pre kernels, and let us know which one starts causing this
problem.
