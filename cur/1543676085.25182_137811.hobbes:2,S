Hi,
ever since kernel 2.5.70 I have a problem with the kernel freezing upon initing the cs4236+
 sound card, whereas previously there was no such problem. Now I get the following message:
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.9.4 (Sat May 31 13:37:06 2003 UTC).
can't register device seq
specify port
isapnp detection failed and probing for CS4236+ is not supported
It says that probing for cs4236+ is not supported, previously this worked just fine though.
Monchi.
