    I've seen this problem too many times, but haven't tried to track
it down.  The video is ATI Rage 128 Pro.
    A common bit seems to be ATI cards, judging from this thread.  I'm
also using the aty128fb framebuffer driver.  My motherboard is Aladdin V
based and so uses the ali-agp module.
    I wonder if all of us who are seeing this problem have any of
these other things in common?
