I wouldn't presume to think I know the details here, but as far as I can tell 
the plain mount command treats it like a device, while using the loop device 
treats it like a file.
It should still be possible to read from the CD like normal, but any 
CD-specific fucntions will likely be disabled, although those are probably 
implemented as ioctls anyway.
So.. try it, and see what you get.
