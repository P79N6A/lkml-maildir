I think there are two issues about system accounting framework.
Issue: 1) How to define the appropriate unit for accounting ?
Current BSD-accountiong make a collection per process accounting information.
CSA make additionally a collection per process-aggregation accounting.
It is appropriate to make the fork-exit event handling framework for definition
of the process-aggregation, such as PAGG.
This system-accounting per process-aggregation is quite useful,
thought I tried the SGI's implementation named 'job' in past days.
Issue: 2) What items should be collected for accounting information ?
BSD-accounting collects PID/UID/GID, User/Sys/Elapsed-Time, and # of
minor/major page faults. SGI's CSA collects VM/RSS size on exit time,
Integral-VM/RSS, and amount of block-I/O additionally.
I think it's hard to implement the accounting-engine as a kernel loadable
module using any kinds of framework. Because, we must put callback functions
into all around the kernel for this purpose.
Thus, I make a proposion as follows:
We should separate the process-aggregation functionality and collecting
accounting informations.
Something of framework to implement process-aggregation is necessary.
And, making a collection of accounting information should be merged
into BSD-accounting and implemented as a part of monolithic kernel
as Guillaume said.
Thanks.
