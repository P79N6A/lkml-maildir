Why? Actually I find it quite logical, we have types.h and posix_types.h. 
waitlock_types.h describes rather well what it contains.

The code is still where it was before. :)
It's just a bit unfamiliar that the types are in separate header, but not 
doing this means we can't use any inline functions or next time we want 
restructure anything, you are busy to get everything compiled again.
I'm open to better ideas, but I don't see a way around this.
bye, Roman
