    Only if it's done incorrectly.  If there's glue to put a notifier
    in, then all the kernel has to do when it attempts to write out data
    to a device that's not there anymore is tickle the notifier, then
    defer the writes 'til the next time sync rolls around.  No notifier
    == data is written to the afterlife with the traditional vomiting of
    error messages to syslog, the console, or whereever.

    That would be a badly implemented userland.  I couldn't imagine
    mounting anything async with a notifier, for then the machine that's
    not running update won't notice that the floppy's gone for several
    weeks.
    A sick notifier could be a simple shellscript, called by mount:
	#! /bin/sh
	DEV=$1
	MAJOR=$2
	MINOR=$3
	mknod /dev/$DEV.tickle $MAJOR $MINOR
	trap 0 1 2 3 9 15 "rm -f /dev/$DEV.tickle"
	while read tickle; do
	    dialog --msgbox --wait 5 "Please put $DEV back"
	    sync $DEV
	done < /dev/$DEV.notify
	exit 0
    with fstab being something like
	/dev/ide0/drive0	/zip	removable,notifier,user,noauto 0 0
