You would need to mask against (1ull << event), not against event.  
tset_bit() might work better.
Do you really want to do this?  It will mean changing every single 
notifier_block definition in the kernel, in addition to all the the 
notifier_heads.  That's an awful lot of work for a relatively small gain.  
I believe that notifier_call_chain does not run very often, but I don't 
have any actual figures.
