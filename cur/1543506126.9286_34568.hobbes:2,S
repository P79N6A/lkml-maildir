This is a different issue, what I was referring to is CPU vs. memory
coherency - what you describe is PCI vs memory coherency. You'd
normally like to simply invalidate the pages involved early so they
can be used by the CPU for other areas while it is doing other
things. How to handle the case you describe is kinda nasty since I
asume it will cause some busy waiting (or an extra interrupt phase) if
one has to go in and tell the bus to finish up befrore continuing.
