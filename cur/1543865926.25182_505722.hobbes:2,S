Yes.

At the moment it is not, but it may be a neccessary side effect of full
support for the later SATA capable controllers in native SATA mode. In
which case you might get it one day.
The legacy mode is itself as good as most typical PATA controllers and
better than some.

The legacy mode has full DMA support. What you don't get is the ability
to queue multiple commands so the hardware can fire off a new command as
the first completes and to have the hardware do some of the general
poking around for us.
