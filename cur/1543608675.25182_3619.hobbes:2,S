How about this:
struct ioctl_payload {
    int how_many;
    int* numbers;
};
User space sets things up normally, with a valid pointer in 'numbers'.
Kernel space copy_from_user the structure, then copy_from_user the number's
memory...
Can that work?  If so, numbers could of course be any data structure we want...
