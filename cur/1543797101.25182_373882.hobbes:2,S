But if a lock is used exclusively to protect a int variable, an atomic_t
seems to be more appropriate to me. Isn't it?

The patches don't implement any new lock scheme neither change the
current behaviour. They just replace a spin_lock + integer variable
(the spinlock is used just to protect an integer variable) by an atomic_t.
The patches aren't adding any "own lock scheme", but just replacing
a spinlock that is used exclusively to protect an integer variable
(write_urb_busy) by an atomic_t.
The whole point of the changes is that using a spin_lock to protect only
a int variable doesn't look like a Right Thing.
Please, if you could, review the patches with this in mind: we aren't
changing any behaviour neither creating any weird lock scheme, we are
only doing two things:
1. Putting all the duplicated code that handles write_urb_busy (that
   already exists) in only one place
2. Replacing a spin_lock that is being used to protect only a single
   integer field by an atomic_t
People got scared when they looked at the patch that does (1), thinking
that we were creating new, weird, locking scheme (because we are doing (2)
at the same time). But we are just isolating the existing 'write_urb_busy'
scheme that is duplicated all around the usb-serial drivers.
I guess (1) is a Good Thing, so the only question is: do you really
disagree about doing (2)?
