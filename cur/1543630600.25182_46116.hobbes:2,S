    Hello all :))
    The GCC compiler insists on ANSIfying the two files mentioned in
the subject, and I think that it should be done by the kernel
maintainers, not GCC ones.
    The little patch for 'nls.h' is to add conditional preprocessor
constructs around a typedef:
    typedef __u16 wchar_t;
   >#ifndef __cplusplus
    typedef __u16 wchar_t;
   >#endif
    The patch for 'a.out.h' is smaller, though:
   |#ifdef linux
   |#ifdef __linux__
    Well, I cannot really see why the ANSI standard is violated in
those two files, but if it is, the changes are pretty small to do...
