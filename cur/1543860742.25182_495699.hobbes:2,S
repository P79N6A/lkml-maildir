I see nothing supporting this IMHO bogus claim.
If you can traverse the device tree using OFW calls, you
can do it to build the in-kernel copy of the tree too.
How the tree is populated, etc., is not an issue for the
common code, for sure.  Each platform does that in whatever
way is appropriate.
But the tree traversal, getting property values, etc. is indeed
a task for the common code and that is exactly what Ben is
suggesting.
