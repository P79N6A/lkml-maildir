	That's exactly why I don't want to deal with it myself.
	However, the kernel deal with it all the time, and do it
well. For example RtNetlink event have this property (except that they
are kernel => process instead of beeing process => process).

	Well, maybe I will simply use a UDP broadcast on the loopback,
it seems much simpler to me. I really wish there was broadcast Unix
