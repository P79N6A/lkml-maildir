Well, drivers do need some way of timing things, else they wouldn't read
jiffies in the first place. So, at minimum, an embedded system would
need a way to trigger a timeout at some specified time in the future.
A simple __get_jiffies() implementation could just set up a 1/HZ-second
timer (and busy-wait for it, and increase its internal jiffies counter)
every tenth call or so. That would probably slow down the whole system
somewhat, but I'd assume it'd mostly work.
