Is there a kernel sound API spec, much like the video4linux spec?
There seems to be a lot of fuzziness with regards to the finer points of
kernel sound support.  For example, some drivers have
	if (oss_compliant)
		act one way
	else
		act another way
I am looking for a doc that documents the practical, currently-in-use
way of doing things [as opposed to the theoretically-correct way of
doing things ;)]
Regards,
	Jeff
