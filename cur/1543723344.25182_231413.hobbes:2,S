Hello,
I uploaded an update to the Videotext driver for the
SAA5246A videotext decoder in 
http://www.michaelgeng.de/linux/saa5246a-2.6.7.patch
The update only changes comments showing that the driver 
also works for the SAA5281 videotext decoder chip. 
This is not surprising because according to the data sheet of 
the SAA5281 it is compatible to the SAA5246A. I have tested 
this with a Siemens Multimedia Extension Board (MXB).
I also added MODULE_AUTHOR and MODULE_DESCRIPTION macros which
were missing up to now.
Patch comment:
V4L: saa5246a driver update, supports saa5281
