Alan: Just a quick note to say that it appears my samba problem with 
2.6.10 has been fixed by 2.6.10-ac1, I can now mount and unmount 
samba shares very quickly, as in milliseconds.

Thats at least a second faster than its ever been before here.  Now to 
see if amanda likes it, something thats an amandad killer got in 
someplace in the mm series leading up to V0.33-04, and amandad would 
turn into a zombie, spoiling a backup.  I'll know in about 5 hours 
how that worked.  Repeated runs of amcheck seem to be fine.
