An offtopic note about consequences:
let's suppose proxy_arp is turned on on eth0 with the primary goal to proxy
addresses available via eth1.  There is another interface eth2 were
1.2.3.0/24 routed to.  Forwarding is turned on everywhere.
Someone decided to save on equipment (or simply made a mistake) and short-cut
eth0 and eth2 segments, unconscious forming "shared media".
What do you think will happen when a broadcast ARP request for 1.2.3.4
arrives to both eth0 and eth2?
Right, "is-at" reply with eth0 MAC address of this poor "proxy" on that
shared media.

Well, what I want is to make the host an arp "proxy" on all interfaces for
all addresses reachable through devX.  I do not want to mess with how
customer configures all other interfaces.
Right now all routes to devX are /32, for all of them proxy arp entries are
created by the same script, and all are happy.
How can it be done better?
New mechanism of fine-grained control over proxy arp? :-)
