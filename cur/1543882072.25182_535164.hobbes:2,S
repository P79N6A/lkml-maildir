Hi.
Hmm. Perhaps I should have added to that last reply that recognising
that they store similar information doesn't mean I think they need the
same high-level routine for both state transitions.
I'd really like to see each driver have some sort of state machine
controlling its power management, into which these calls were just
another input (an important one, but just another alongside information
about policy, whether we're on battery (UPS or laptop) or AC, whether
the device is actually being used and so on.
