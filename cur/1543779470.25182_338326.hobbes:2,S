I'll need to think that through, but not right now.  It's a surprise
to me, and it's likely to surprise the current kernel too.  I'd prefer
to say that if the executable was mapped shared from a writable fd,
then the tracer will write back to it; but you're clearly against that.
We may need to split the vma to handle your semantics correctly.

I'll concentrate on this for now.  s390 used to have the same semantics
as everyone else, they made a conscious choice to diverge, and keep dirty
bit in separate array indexed by struct page, and page_test_and_clear_dirty
macro they use instead of clearing pte_dirty.
It works all right, and I don't think it will prevent us communicating
between maybe_mkwrite and get_user_pages by a pte flag that would be
the usual pte_dirty on every other architecture.  Just need to be
careful to handle the right one right.
