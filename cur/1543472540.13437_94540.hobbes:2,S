Well, then. Maybe what the world needs is a new kind of patent. Maybe
there should be something like a GNU Prior Art Registry where a technique
can be registered (for a fee which is used to maintain the registry) and
is freely redistributable in Free code but would require a royalty for
non-GPL use. This protects the inventor from exploitation yet allows
one to share an idea with the community and also prevents something from
being patented by someone else. It would provide a standard method of
registration that should be able to hold up in court if someone tries to
patent the concept later. 
If you use the code in a product in GPL code, it is OK.  If you use the
product in code with a license that does not meet the GPL, you must pay a
royalty to the inventor.
