G'day folks...
I am cross-posting this to kernel and scsi because
I think you guys should know about it.
Had some spare time and lots of equipment available,
so I got to investigate this issue a bit further.
Now, I am in shock...
It looks like Linux 2.6.x (tested 2.6.2->2.6.4) doesn't
allow writing to SCSI based DVD-RAM or CD-R anymore at all.
I probed several scsi hba models (onboard + isa/pci) from
Initio, Dawicontrol, Tekram and Adaptec.
No luck in writing a single bit onto media..! In every
scsi setup/combination of hardware 2.6.x mounts were
always read-only. Using IDE drives worked flawlessly.
Also checking with a scsi jaz drive seemed to work ok.
Cross checking with linux 2.4.21-192 (Suse) I didn't
encounter any trouble. No matter what scsi setup/combination
I used.
Is someone is going to look into that..? 
thx & regs
td
As a side note - who believes the new aic7xxx scsi driver
has production quality? Not me! Under load this driver seems
to have LOTS of problems (tested with various seagate/ibm/hitachi
disks in single disk configuration).
