I could also live with a dmask option. But then it would be great to have 
this option with every file system not only vfat.

This i my preferred solution. I cannot image a situation where it is useful, 
to have a execution flag on all files, if the file system has a noexec flag.
But I see a lot of problems, like the Midnight Commander Logic.
On the other side, it is quite sensible to remove the execution flags from a 
file if you cannot execute them.
