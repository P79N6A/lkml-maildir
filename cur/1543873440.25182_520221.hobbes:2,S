The pointer in struct page approach is a decent one, which I have
liked since this whole container effort came up. IIRC Linus and Alan
also thought that was a reasonable way to go.
I haven't reviewed the rest of the beancounters patch since looking
at it quite a few months ago... I probably don't have time for a
good review at the moment, but I should eventually.

The issue is just that struct pages use low memory, which is a really
scarce commodity on PAE. One more pointer in the struct page means
64MB less lowmem.
But PAE is crap anyway. We've already made enough concessions in the
kernel to support it. I agree: struct page overhead is not really
significant. The benefits of simplicity seems to outweigh the downside.

I think they could be shared. You allocate _new_ pages from your own
node, but you can definitely use existing pages allocated to other
nodes.

Yes there would be some accounting differences. I think it is hard
to say exactly what containers are "using" what page anyway, though.
What do you say about unmapped pages? Kernel allocations? etc.

?
page_to_nid(page) ~= container that owns it.

I haven't looked at any implementation, but I think it is fine for
the zone to stay around.

I don't understand why? You can much more easily target a specific
container for reclaim with this approach than with others (because
you have an lru per container).

I'm not sure about that. If you have a larger number of nodes, then
you could assign more free nodes to a container on demand. But I
think there would definitely be less flexibility with nodes...
I don't know... and seeing as I don't really know where the google
guys are going with it, I won't misrepresent their work any further ;)

Good luck ;)
