I would disagree.  The only difference between the two is WHERE the 
state is maintained - ram vs. disk.  I won't really argue it though, 
because it's just semantics -- call it whatever you want.

This is not true.  The USB bus is shut down either way, and provided 
that you have not unplugged the disk, nothing will be screwed when you 
resume from disk or ram.
