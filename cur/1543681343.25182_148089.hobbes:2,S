1MHz to proces 1Mbit doing what - file I/O to and from disk, web serving
- because ToE or otherwise I still have to process the data I receive
and do something useful with it unless I'm just a router, firewall or
load balancer. If you want to argue about using gate arrays and hardware
to accelerate IP routing, balancing and firewall filter cams then you
might get somewhere - but they dont need to talk TCP.
Also if its 1MHz per 1Mbit worse case and your ToE engine isnt entirely
hardware paths capable of sustaining 10Gbit/sec, what happens when I hit
you with 10Gbit of carefully chosen non optimal frames ?
