It does seem risky.  Perhaps it is a micro-optimisation which utilises
knowledge that this thread_struct cannot be looked up via any path in this
context.
Or perhaps it is a bug.  Andi, can you please comment?

Don't know.

That all looks rather deliberate.

No, I don't immediately see anything in the flush_old_exec() code path
which tells us that nobody else can look up this thread_info (or be holding
a ref to it) in this context.

heh.  Haarvard, you got a bug.
