Do you still make the distinction between Inactive Clean
and Inactive Dirty (& just move to appropriate list)?
Effectively this is just a 'binary' aging function (OK position
on the list matters too). Others on the list have observed
page->age performs in a binary manner anyhow with exponential
aging.
How do you balance between Inactive Clean before Inactive Dirty
and avoid evicting many (infrequently used) code pages at
the expense of many (historic, even less frequently used) dirty
data pages? Or don't we care?
