There are no choices. Configuration goes in /etc and /usr/local SHOULD be empty
after installation of Linux system except of 7 empty subdirectories:
bin, games, include, lib, sbin, share, src ...

3.4.1  /etc/X11 : Configuration for the X Window System
/etc/X11 is the recommended location for all X11 host-specific
configuration.  This directory is necessary to allow local control if
/usr is mounted read only.  Files that should be in this directory
include Xconfig (and/or XF86Config) and Xmodmap.

No. See above.

Since FHS says that it's belond to /etc/X11 ...

No. It's in /etc/X11 as it should be.

There are no such dir.

RedHat put then in /var/lock as it should:
-- cut --
5.5  /var/lock : Lock files
Lock files should be stored within the /var/lock directory structure.
The naming convention which must be used is "LCK.." followed by the base
name of the device.  For example, to lock /dev/cua0 the file "LCK..cua0"
would be created.

This is not religion anymore. You have no choice (and this is good thing).

I'm refer on this part of FHS:
-- cut --
Different people prefer to place user accounts in a variety of places.
Therefore, no program should rely on this location.  If you want to find
out a user's home directory, you should use the getpwent(3) library
function rather than relying on /etc/passwd because user information may
be stored remotely using systems such as NIS.

Debian with it's perl-based startup system is even worse. Since this is
religion this aspect is not touched in FHS :-((

*ALL WORKS* ? This will never happens. glibc works more reliable then libc5

This is not a solution at all: take a look on linuxhq and try just count
distributions (including different versions! RedHat 5.x has chkconfig while
4.x does not). And you want to say that all programs must be aware about all
distributions ??? You are on drugs :-((

Even with all glitches this is simpliest to use linux install I'm seen...
BTW I'm does not use disk druid and all works fine for me here with fdisk, etc.
Hostname could be changed easily via Control Panel (just click on Network
Configuration), LinuxConf (Config->Networking->Client tasks->Basic host
information->Host name) or via edition of /etc/sysconfig/network, etc. If
you can not drive this is does not mean that you are using broken car -- may
be you just can not drive...
