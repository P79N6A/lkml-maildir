Both patches are working for me (Dell D600). before i was unable to
suspend to disk on this laptop (it was stuck in alps code).
By the way, i have an unrelated problem:
if the kernel was booted with the "noresume" option, it cannot be
suspended, it fails with:
swsusp: FATAL: cannot find swap device, try swapon -a!
Thanks,
Benoit
