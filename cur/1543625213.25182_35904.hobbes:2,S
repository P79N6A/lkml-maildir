 The value is correct as after issuing the poll i8259 command the next
read cycle to the PIC returns an IRQ level (0x07 = no IRQ active; it
shouldn't happen here -- 0x80 is expected for active IRQ 0).

 Any chance your system uses the ExtINTA mode for the timer IRQ?  This
would be very weird -- it's the fourth, last attempt to set up the timer
IRQ, meant not to happen really anytime (and it also means the i8259A
implementation is buggy, incomplete or is wired incorrectly).  What does
your bootstrap log contain?
 If that's really the case then the following patch should help -- there
is a subtle bug in the code indeed, sigh.
