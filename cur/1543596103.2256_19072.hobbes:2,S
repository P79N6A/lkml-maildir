No.  We want network drivers to be in the network menu, SCSI drivers in
the SCSI menu etc.  Some of those drivers are restricted to some
architectures but putting them in the arch config splits the logical
flow of selection and duplicates text.  Look at the repeated SCSI code
in some of the arch configs.

dep_arch_tristate '  AM79C961A support' CONFIG_ARM_AM79C961A $CONFIG_ARCH_ACORN $CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET
fails your code.  $CONFIG_ARCH_ACORN is undefined, $CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET
is 'y'.  dep_arch_tristate is invoked with 3 (not 4 parameters), text,
CONFIG_ARM_AM79C961A and 'y'.  The intervening undefined variable
disappears in shell scripts.
