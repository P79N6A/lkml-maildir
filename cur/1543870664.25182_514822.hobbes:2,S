The memory is likely in use but there is enough memory free in unmapped 
clean pagecache pages so that we occasionally are able to free pages. Then 
the app is reading more from disk replenishing that ...
Thus we are forever cycling through the LRU lists moving pages between 
the lists aging etc etc. Can lead to a livelock.

We have fixed the case in which we compile the kernel without swap. Then 
anonymous pages behave like mlocked pages. Did we do more than that?
