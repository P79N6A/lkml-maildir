Please don't top post.
512 wasn't the point, setting it properly is the point. If you need more
than 512, go ahead. This isn't Holger's problem, though, the reading
would be much faster if it was. If the fusion is using a large queue
depth, increasing nr_requests would likely help the writes (but not to
the extent of where it would suddenly be as fast as it should).
