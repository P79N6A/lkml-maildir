I can confirm that there is some sort of problem with
PIO and SMP. Either exercising only DMA commands, or booting
with maxcpus=1 avoids the problem. At present, I suspect
the PIO task and/or state machine, but I'm still investigating.
I doubt this problem will occur unless you have concurrent
PIO access to different controllers on an SMP system.
