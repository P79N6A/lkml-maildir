Well no. All addresses in the kernel are virtual addresses. You got
a number, which seemed like the correct place, but that number does
not represent the virtual address at which it can be accessed. For
starters, take that number and OR in PAGE_OFFSET. This is a way of
cheating, it is not the correct way, but you can then dereference
the resulting pointer (for experimental use only, standard disclaimers
apply).
Cheers,
