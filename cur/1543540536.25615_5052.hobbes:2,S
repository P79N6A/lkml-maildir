Subject: RE: SM56 driver for LINUX
Hi and thanks for emailing. As of this time, we have no drivers for LINUX
for the SM56K products, however, our engineering staff is looking into 
the
feasibility of creating just such a driver.  We have no definite answer 
or
time frame for the release of such drivers at this time, but encourage 
you
to keep an eye on the web site for any changes or updates to this issue. 
If
we can be of further assistance, please let us know.
Thanks,
Hans-Joachim
