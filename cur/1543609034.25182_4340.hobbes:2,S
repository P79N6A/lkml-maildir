Hi,
    Sorry for posting it to the wrong list. But people here can surely help me
out.
Let us suppose a operator is FTPing a file "temp.c" to a folder "/home/work".
And a process "A" is monitoring "/home/work". How would process "A" would know a
file "temp.c" is completely transfered in "/home/work"
Please CC it to me as I am not subscribed to list
Thanks in anticipation
Amol
