Subject: [PATCH] PCMCIA: make Pretec CF Wifi use hostap_cs by default
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I use two Zaurus palmtops - one run 2.4.18 kernel (it's sl-5500) and second 
run 2.6.16. Both are running under control of OpenZaurus distribution 
(I'm Release Manager of it).
When I use pcmcia-cs then my Pretec WiFi card is handled by hostap driver
and everything is working fine. Recently I switched to pcmciautils and after
card insert orinoco modules are loaded. I prefer to use hostap modules
because they work the same under 2.4 and 2.6 kernels (with orinoco I have to
use 0.13e ones because never ones does not work under 2.4/arm).
This patch adds definition of my card to hostap_cs cardlist. It was tested on
Sharp Zaurus C760 palmtop running 2.6.16 + pcmciautils 010 + udev 084
PS - I'm not subscribed to that list - so please Cc: me on reply.
