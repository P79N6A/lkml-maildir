Could you elaborate on these SuperIO and MFD thingies?  Especially with
reference to my point that multiple controllers *are* allowed, and that
this is just a platform-specific issue?  (As shown by the fact that the
API works fine with OMAP1, accessing both GPIO and MPUIO controllers
through those API calls ...)

I really don't see this at all (see previous email).

On the contrary, keeping board-specific pin configuration code out of otherwise
generic/portable device drivers is a Very Good Thing.  And that primarily means
moving that code into platform/board specific setup code.  (Today's Linux doesn't
have other places to put such code, especially if you don't want to demand much
from typically-sluggish boot loader teams.)

I don't see this either.
In the primary "production board" use case, there is absolutely a "preferred"
pin mux config state:  each pin is connected to one peripheral in one way.
And typically its configuration is never changed; if it is, that's something
the pin mux API would need to handle.  (One example:  using a UART's RXD
pin as a wakeup GPIO while the system sleeps.  Presumably there are others.)
The only situation where there might not be a "preferred" mode is very much
a secondary use case:  the "development board", used to hook up many different
kinds of peripheral hardware.  Even in those cases, it makes perfect sense
for Kconfig options to define the _current_ "preferred" mode -- these pins
get muxed for the peripheral that's actually connected today, rather than the
one that we developed two months ago.  Because those drivers being developed
are going to be used with a "production board", where costs incurred for
dynamic configuration are undesirable...

I'd be surprised to see it in 2.6.19, but that's what the patch is against;
though I'd not say it's "too late" in any absolute sense, it's certainly a
small and safe enough change (and bigger changes have gone in later).

You've not shown any technical problems with the proposal though; nothing
about it is a "temporary hack".  The functionality in it is clearly
satisfactory enough to work for at least a dozen different platforms,
which are now using similar code.  I don't see why you're so negative...

Sure, so what's the problem you have with this then?  It doesn't expose
pin numbers, just GPIO numbers.  It allows platforms to support multiple
controllers.  It doesn't even get in the way of whatever wierd pin mux
setup any given platforms needs.  You should be applauding!
