  It  is a good thought. However I think they are trying to figure out
  a  way  to have the metadata and streams to be accesible with legacy
  applications.
  The  file-as-directory  concept is one way, which still seem to have
  issues.
  How  are  things  done on Windows platforms when there are files and
  directories  with the same name? In Unix that is imposible. How does
  it  work  for  environments  like  Cygwin  etc? What happen to tools
  that run in them?
