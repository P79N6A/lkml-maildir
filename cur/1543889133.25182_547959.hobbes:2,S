I think you have major memory corruption. That first oops disassembles to
		mov    0x10(%eax),%esi
		mov    $0xfffffdfd,%eax
		test   %esi,%esi
		je     after_call
		mov    %edx,%ecx
		mov    %edi,%eax
		mov    %ebx,%edx
		call   *%esi
	after_call:
which is (from net/ipv4/af_inet.c, inet_ioctl()):
                default:
                        if (sk->sk_prot->ioctl)
                                err = sk->sk_prot->ioctl(sk, cmd, arg);
                        else
                                err = -ENOIOCTLCMD;
                        break;
and the load off "sk->sk_prot->ioctl" oopses, because "sk->sk_prot" is 
corrupt and contains 0x8e3cad42, which is not a valid kernel pointer.
The other oops is even worse. 
I also think it meshes with
	sky2 eth0: descriptor error q=0x280 get=285 [800042375e2e5e] put=285
and I suspect your memory got corrupted by sky2 reading the wrong 
descriptors, and overwriting kernel memory.
So it's almost certainly some DMA problem. Now, _why_ you have DMA 
problems, I have no idea. But can you try:
 - disable CONFIG_PREEMPT
 - disable CONFIG_HIGHMEM if you have it on
 - just in general see if you can disable any kernel config options that 
   might be unnecessary.
to see if it changes the situation at all..
