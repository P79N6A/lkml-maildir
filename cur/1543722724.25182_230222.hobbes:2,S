What you're suggesting is not something that could be controlled by the 
file system because there are far too many methods for storing email.  
Consider, for instance, if all email messages are stored in a single 
database file.  Unless you include parsing code for all email storage 
methods, there's no possible way for your design to work.  As you should 
be able to see, this "feature" should be implemented in the email server 
code; *not* the file system.
Personally, I would rather not use this feature, at all; but, I'm also 
entitled to leaving the elastic bit turned off on all my messages.
