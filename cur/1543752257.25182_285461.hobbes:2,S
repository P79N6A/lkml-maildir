what kind of non-audio workload was there during this test? 43 xruns
arent nice but arent that bad either.
plus, is it 100% sure that all audio threads inherited the nice --20
priority - including the client threads? Nornally jackd does a
setscheduler for the client threads so that they get boosted to
SCHED_FIFO, but there is no parallel to that in the nice --20 case, did
you do that manually (or did you start the clients up from the nice --20
shell too?))
If the nice --20 priority setup is perfect and there are still xruns
then could you try the following hack, change this line in
kernel/sched.c:
 #define STARVATION_LIMIT        (MAX_SLEEP_AVG)
to:
 #define STARVATION_LIMIT        0
this will turn off starvation checking, for testing purposes. (to see
whether there's anything else but anti-starvation causing xruns.)
