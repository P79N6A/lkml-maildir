On suggestions from a few people, I tried underclocking the system to
1200 mhz (x12 instead of x13) and most of the problems went away.
The jagged lines on xawtv are present only during "fast motion" although
there is some fuzz on all motion, its watchable (akin to slightly bad
reception.)
The usb keyboard problems went away (that could relate to other things
I've been messing with - X seems happier w/ 2 usb keyboards than with
just 1 for some reason.)
Testing sound and such, no skips or other issues from xmms, even when
top reports 70-80% idle.
CPU states:  22.2% user,  10.9% system,  24.7% nice,  42.2% idle
CPU Temp: +35.8 C     (limit = +51 C,  hysteresis = +49 C) 
So I'm about 10C lower than before. Yay :)
Any way to selectively enable/disable this from userspace? (Such that,
eg, when I'm not watching tv I can enable, when I fire up xawtv and/or
high-load apps I can disable..)  
Maybe (eventually) base it off load average..? (So load >.8 its
disabled, below that its selectively enabled - daemon to handle it could
be taught to check process lists, etc..)
