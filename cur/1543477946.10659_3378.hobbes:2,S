I got caught by that one myself; I haven't had any opportunity to use
the 2.1.x kernels during the development cycle like I did with 1.3.x,
and my home system (slackware 3.0 with many updates) was updated from
a 1.2.13 kernel - the /dev directory was still configured for the
1.2 pty assignments, but ran fine on 2.0.  Perhaps a note to tell users
who are running 2.0 systems which were updated from 1.2 along the lines
of "If your system originally had a kernel previous to 2.0, be sure your
/dev directory has been updated" would avoid some grief.
