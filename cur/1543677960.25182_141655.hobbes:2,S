I was able to reproduce this.  Pid #0 (swapper) ends up with a preempt
count of two and everything goes pear-shaped.
This appears to be because you haven't selected any chip drivers in IDE
config.  I selected PIIX and things started working better.
Just to double-check I took my usual .config, enable preemption, disabled
all IDE chip drivers and the same thing happened.  Over to Bart ;)
Your .config seems broken in other ways btw.  Suggest you do 
	cp arch/i386/defconfig .config
and start again.
