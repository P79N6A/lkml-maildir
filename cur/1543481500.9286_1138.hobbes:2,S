The Toshiba Satelite 205CDS needs to be added to that list as well.  (I know
that one is not on there. Don't remember the URL however.  Getting X to run on
it was an adventure.  (A certain amount of chip override is needed.)  I had
three people at ApacheCon ask me for the XConfig for that model.
Not really a kernel issue however.
I have noticed that the laptop drive I have from IBM does not have ANY disk
cache.  This seems to be a problem from time to time when the I/O gets a bit
too heavy.  Is there an easy way to deal with this or am I just stuck with the
occasional reset messages? (I have not tried the new 2.2.0 series yet.  Waiting
for the final.)
