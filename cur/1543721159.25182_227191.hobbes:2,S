The commonly used kernel structure iovec includes a field iov_base which
is:
	void __user *iov_base
Unfortunately some of the places that use this are sockets calls from
kernel code in which it would be awkward to do extra memcpy to a user
buffer (from a kernel buffer, perhaps created in a different process)
just to avoid a sparse warning.   Although it works fine to set
	myiovec.iov_base = (char *)some_buffer; 
this generates a warning message in the sparse tool since iov_base
includes the __user modifier, and the kernel buffer you are sending does
not..
If a buffer is never used in user space, and is potentially recycled
(via mempools) for use by more than one process, then it can't be passed
around as an __user buffer, but is it ok to simply do
	myiovec.iov_base = (__user char *)some_buffer; 
or is there another preferred way to handle kernel to __user
mappings/casts?
For the cifs vfs this would eliminate the last sparse warnings.
