I wasn't talking about locks.  I was talking about kernel functions 
taking long periods of time, cases where preempt has been useful to 
reduce kernel latency.
Holding locks for extended periods is something else entirely.
I presume there are sane cases where a kernel function will need to 
execute for a "long time", like when doing PIO disk access or COW, etc. 
  It would be good to have a way to limit the impact of those functions 
in terms of user-perceived latency, just as preempt has done, but 
without preempt.
At least, I thought that was the idea.
Now, the thing is, if you have explicit cooperative yields, then a slow 
CPU might not yield often enough, and a fast CPU would yield too often. 
    Preempt has the advantage of using real time so that CPUs can 
maximize throughput without affecting latency.
