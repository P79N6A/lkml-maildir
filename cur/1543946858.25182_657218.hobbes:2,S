Ok, if AVC is incidental then I don't need to mention it, and so don't
need to define the acronym.

How about this. I tried to explain what happens to audit messages.
        bool "Auditing support"
        depends on NET
        help
-         Enable auditing infrastructure that can be used with another
-         kernel subsystem, such as SELinux (which requires this for
-         logging of avc messages output).  Does not do system-call
-         auditing without CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL.

I'm puzzled about "end up in the kernel syslog". Looking at include/linux/audit.h
it seems that they go nowhere:
#ifdef CONFIG_AUDIT
  [...]
#else
#define audit_log(c,g,t,f,...) do { ; } while (0)
#define audit_log_start(c,g,t) ({ NULL; })
#define audit_log_vformat(b,f,a) do { ; } while (0)
#define audit_log_format(b,f,...) do { ; } while (0)
#define audit_log_end(b) do { ; } while (0)
#define audit_log_hex(a,b,l) do { ; } while (0)
#define audit_log_untrustedstring(a,s) do { ; } while (0)
#define audit_log_n_untrustedstring(a,n,s) do { ; } while (0)
#define audit_log_d_path(b, p, d) do { ; } while (0)
#define audit_enabled 0
#endif
So it looks like if CONFIG_AUDIT is not defined then audit messages are
ignored. Syslog is used by kernel/audit.c when there is an audit
failure, which seems to be mainly if the userspace audit daemon is not
running.
