Stop using icecream or anything that might to any kind of binary object
caching or header analysis to minimize compiles during the build. Make sure
you're really cleaning the entire kernel directory before each build. Make
sure it'a full build for starters.
Throw a #error in the __put_task_struct_inline(), not the alternative
__put_task_struct(). It should bark at compile time and fail to compile
kernel/fork.c
The function __put_task_struct() should never show up a stack trace
EVER. That function has been rename under all things CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
under my addendum patches. That's why I'm starting to think it's your
build environment or you're miss applying the patches.
