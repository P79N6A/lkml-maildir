   OK. I guess we will use the ioctl interface.  Seems ugly, but it
   works.  We will need to deal with the issue of apps invoking ioctls
   (thinking they are using a device) and potentially hitting these
   file operations.
Unless they try to pass an EXT2/XFS/etc. ioctl cmd they will
get ENOTTY, I don't think there is any issue.
Later,
