Returning back to this, since block based storage, which can act as a
shared storage/transport layer, is ready with 5'th release of the DST.
My couple of notes on proposed data distribution algorithm in FS.

This looks like a good way to work with offline clients (where I recall
Coda), after offline node modified data, it should be merged back to the
cluster with different algorithms.
Data (supposed to be) written to the failed node during its offline time
will be resynced from other nodes when failed one is online, there are
no problems and/or special algorithms to be used here.
Filesystem replication is not a 100% 'git way' - git tree contains
already combined objects - i.e. the last blob for given path does not
contain its history, only ready to be used data, while filesystem,
especially that one which requires simultaneous write from different
threads/nodes, should implement copy-on-write semantics, essentially
putting all new data (git commit) to the new location and then collect
it from different extents to present a ready file.
At least that is how I see the filesystem I'm working on.

Git semantics and copy-on-write has actually quite a lot in common (on
high enough level of abstraction), but SHA1 index is not a possible 
issue in filesystem - even besides amount of data to be hashed before
key is ready. Key should also contain enough information about what
underlying data is - git does not store that information (tree, blob or
whatever) in its keys, since it does not require it. At least that is
how I see it to be implemented.
Overall I see this new project as a true copy-on-write FS.
Thanks.
