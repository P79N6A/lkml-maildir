Aha, yes. You are right.

I think 2.4 is fixable. My original patch for 2.4 was:

This patch just reorder old codes in fault route:
if(fault){
   unlock(futex);
   ret = -ERRVAR;
   unqueue();
   put_page();
   return ret;
}
to new one:
if(fault){
   unqueue_in_lock();
   unlock(futex);
   ret = -ERRVAR;
   put_page();
   return ret;
}
It protects the temporarily queued thread from wakes, doesn't it?
If this work, it could be said that we can fix 2.6 futex with a
spinlock... but it will be slow, slow...
Thanks,
H.Seto
