Because SIGCHLD isn't a POSIX realtime signal, only one copy of it will
be queued at any one time -- even with signalfd(), and even though they
have different (useful) siginfo_t.
So if you have three children die in rapid succession, you only get the
siginfo for the first one.  Thus you still have to call
waitid()/waitpid() in a loop, and wait on everything.
Could the fact that you don't get signalfd notification of the
additional signals be considered a bug?  Or possibly a useful additional
feature?
If we were able to read all the queued SIGCHLD signals with signalfd
(preserving the one pending only behaviour of ordinary delivery), then a
loop like the following would be possible:
  sigemptyset (&mask);
  sigaddset (&mask, SIGCHLD);
  sfd = signalfd (-1, &mask, 0);
  for (;;) {
    read (sfd, &fdsi, sizeof (struct signalfd_siginfo));
    waitpid (fdsi.ssi_pid, 0, 0);
  }
So you only need to wait for each one individually.
