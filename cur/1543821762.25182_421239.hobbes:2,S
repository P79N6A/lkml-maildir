I have noticed a problem which I believe is in sr_mod.  Doesn't matter if
the physical connection is ide, scsi, usb, etc.
If I access a drive that is not ready (ie, no disc, or in the process of
loading in a disc), the drive will no longer function properly.
I'm not sure if I can explain it fully, and I'm not sure if it's already
been reported.
I place a CD on the tray and do a mount.  Mount will fail (lets just assume
that under 2.4.x this worked).  I eject the cd and reinsert and wait for it
to become ready.  Mount will still fail.  Last I recall getblks ioctl
returns 2 or 4 in this case.  The only way to fix is to rmmod sr_mod and
reinsert sr_mod.
another example would be that I insert a disc, say with 159000 sectors and
I'm able to read from it just fine.  I make the above mistake but I insert a
disc with 200,000 sectors.  The disc will be reported with 159000 instead of
the correct 200,000 sectors and some files will not be readable.  Again,
rmmod and modprobe sr_mod fixes the problem.
I've been able to reproduce this on every linux system running 2.6 that I've
used with a CDRom.
