hmm, i'm not so sure -- 1.3.x is our stable release, and it sounds like
this change has added an instability.

i'm guessing from your description that the missed event will be noticed
when the next socket arrives.  i.e. if the server is pretty busy then the
missed events are not important.  but if it's not a busy server, like a
hit every hour, then the missed event may be noticeable to browsers (as a
timeout waiting for server activity).
does that pretty much sum it up?

i.e. if the socket was used both in accept() and in select() at the same
time?  (which apache doesn't do)
