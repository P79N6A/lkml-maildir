Sure, I get this too:
 It now says (copied by hand):  
         freeing memory: .....................|
 (this 'freeing' takes ages, around 30 seconds, while in progress, the disk
  light blinks every once in a while, perhaps each time while a dot is being
 printed)
         syncing disks
         suspending devices
         suspending device c0418bcc
         suspending devices
         suspending device c0418bcc
         suspending: hda ------------------[ cut here
         trace back:
   
           device_susp()
           drivers_susp()
           do_software_susp()
This happens, I think, from here in kernel/suspend.c:
/* Called from process context */
static int drivers_suspend(void)
{
        device_suspend(4, SUSPEND_NOTIFY);
	device_suspend(4, SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE);
        device_suspend(4, SUSPEND_DISABLE);
	...
I think the problem occurs on the second call, SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE:
static int idedisk_suspend(struct device *dev, u32 state, u32 level)
{
        ide_drive_t *drive = dev->driver_data;
        printk("Suspending device %p\n", dev->driver_data);
        /* I hope that every freeze operation from the upper levels have
         * already been done...
         */
        if (level != SUSPEND_SAVE_STATE)
                return 0;
        /* set the drive to standby */
        printk(KERN_INFO "suspending: %s ", drive->name);
        do_idedisk_standby(drive);
        drive->blocked = 1;
        BUG_ON (HWGROUP(drive)->handler);  // <----- this BUGs
        return 0;
}

bert
