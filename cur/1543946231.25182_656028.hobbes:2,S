It's the other way round, gcc assumes that you know better than gcc when 
you give it a __builtin_expect().
The example you gave had only a 1:3 ratio, which is far outside of the 
ratios where __builtin_expect() should be used.
What if you gave this annotation for the 1:3 case and gcc generates code 
that performs better for ratios > 1:1000 but much worse for a 1:3 ratio
since your hint did override a better estimate of gcc?

I'm a firm believer in the following:
- it's the programmer's job to write clean and efficient C code
- it's the compiler's job to convert C code into efficient assembler
  code
The stable interface between the programmer and the compiler is C, and 
when the programmer starts manually messing with internals of the 
compiler that's a layering violation that requires a _good_ 
justification.
With a "good justification" not consisting of some microbenchmark but of 
measurements of the actual annotations in the kernel code.
