OK, it starts here from Catherine's patch:
include/net/scm.h::scm_recv()
+	if (test_bit(SOCK_PASSSEC, &sock->flags)) {
+		err = security_sid_to_context(scm->sid, &scontext, &scontext_len);
+		if (!err)
+ 			put_cmsg(msg, SOL_SOCKET, SCM_SECURITY, scontext_len, scontext);
+ }
Catherine, the security_sid_to_context() is a raw SELinux function which
crept into core code and should not have been there.  The fallout fixes
included conditionally exporting security_sid_to_context, and finally
scm_send/recv unlining.  The end result in -mm looks broken to me.
Specifically, it now does:
	ucred->uid = tsk->uid;
	ucred->gid = tsk->gid;
	ucred->pid = tsk->tgid;
	scm->fp = NULL;
	scm->seq = 0;
	if (msg->msg_controllen <= 0)
		return 0;
	scm->sid = security_sk_sid(sock->sk, NULL, 0);
The point of Catherine's original patch was to make sure there's always
a security identifier associated with AF_UNIX messages.  So receiver
can always check it (same as having credentials even w/out sender
control message passing them).  Now we will have garbage for sid.
thanks,
