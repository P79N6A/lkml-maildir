ALC650(E) is the AC97 codec chip.  There must be an audio core in
addition, most likely Intel ICH chips or VIA 82xx chips.  Both are
supported by ALSA, snd-intel8x0 and snd-via8xx drivers, respectively.
On OSS, they are i810_audio and via82cxxx_audio drivers.
ALC650E is a revision E of ALC650, which has some minor extensions
(like S/PDIF support) but mostly identical with ALC650. 
So both should work.
