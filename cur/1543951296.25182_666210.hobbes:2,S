Ok then you won't be able to repeat the test ever.
I consider this bad practice in test code because it makes it impossible
to stabilize bugs and when I wrote it I tried to avoid by using the 
srandom32(). But I originally fell into the trap of assuming it had the 
same semantics of stdlib srandom() which it didn't. This patch was
my attempt to fix that mistake.

It adds a non random seed which does not add any randomness only to CPU #0.
Strictly it doesn't hurt very much, but it's also not useful for anything.
