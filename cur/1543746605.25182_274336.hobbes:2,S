That's roughly what we're doing now, apart from the offlining/onlining.
I had considered trying to take better advantage of SMP support (perhaps
run a decompression thread on one CPU and the writer on the other, eg),
so we might want to apply this just to the region immediately around the
atomic copy/restore. That makes me wonder, though, what the advantage is
to switching to using the hotplug functionality - is it x86 only, or
more cross platform? (If more cross platform, that might possibly be an
advantage over the current code).

All of the other threads, including the migration threads, are frozen,
so I don't believe that anything gets migrated to CPU0. I'll double
check when I next suspend.
As to the timers, I fully agree. Thawing them needs a mechanism for
keeping the per-cpu timers staggered.

Nigel
