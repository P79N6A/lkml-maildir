With the 2.2.18pre22 kernel and also pre21 last time I checked
if you compile the kernel with DHCP and BOOTP, it's impossible 
to use bootp, you need to recompile the kernel without dhcp.
The problem (bug) is that dhcp code is _always_ executed also in 
the case of bootp, breaking the procedure :(
I love to have dhcp and bootp compiled into kernel, so I can
chose my preferred protocol with the ip=XXXX option.
I don't like this _goto_ patch against 2.2.18pre22, but work :
