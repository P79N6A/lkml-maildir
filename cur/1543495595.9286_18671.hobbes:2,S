Hi,
OK, looks like only reset is necessary:
    outb (0x08, PPORT+CONTROL);
    usleep (1);
    outb (0x0c, PPORT+CONTROL);
BTW, Win98 and probably other OSs send RESET to printer during boot. At
least, when the printer is ON and Win98 is loading, the printer performes the
very same movements as when I send reset command using this code.
