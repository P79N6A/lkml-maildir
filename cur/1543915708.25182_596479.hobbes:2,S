Are you sure this isn't happening? I'll run some tests on my SMP system
running CFS. But I'll bet the context switch rate is quite rapid.
Honestly, I can't imagine what else could be happening here. Does CFS spin
in a loop doing nothing when you call sched_yield even though another task
is ready-to-run? That seems kind of bizarre. Is sched_yield acting as a
no-op?
