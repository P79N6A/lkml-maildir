I'd been meaning to ask this. So the machines you have which don't
describe 0xf0000 as reserved also don't describe it as RAM? (I guess
it's either a hole in the table or one of the other e820 types).
So it sounds like it would be acceptable to simply invert the test in my
original patch as below? (actually reverting to my original-original
patch which I never sent out because checking for reserved sounded more
correct at the time, which was dumb of me because I was well aware of
the other possible types, I must have been having one of those days).
Ian.

Subject: [PATCH] x86: Do not scan for DMI if the DMI region is marked as RAM by e820.
Under Xen the memory at 0xf0000 is regular RAM and so can potentially contain a
page table and hence cannot be mapped. The e820 map given to guest reflects
this.
