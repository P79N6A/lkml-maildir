Well, then would you please email the programmers of
CD Copier Pro 2.0		CD Master PRO 9.0		CDRWin 3.6b
DiskJugg			Easy CD Creator DELUXE v.3.5a	Feurio
NTi CD Maker 3.1.530		Nero 4.0.0.2 E			PTS
Audio-CD-MP3-Studio 1.0		Packet-CD 3.0.157		Prassi CDRep
SmartCD Neighborhood		SmartCD Recording		Win On CD
to adhere to standards, to name the most popular CD burning software.
I'm sure they'd be happy to oblige, as they all support Linux well.
</sarcasm>
Seriously: It's sad, but if we don't want to piss off a BIG number of
people we'll have to adjust to the crap most people produce on their CDs,
even if it IS crap and everybody KNOWS it.
Samba also managed to support Win95 servers although they have an
absolutely <censored> way of producing long file names over the network,
IIRC.
I will be happy to test such software, as soon as I get one of these
'broken' CDs.

Mine too. Is there a way to specify which should be used, if you mount such
a CD under Linux?

Hopefully, you don't take this personally. I think I forgot some emoticons.
