Hi,
I'm trying to use a hawking hwu54g with the zd1211rw driver in the
2.6.20 linux kernel. It works ok when I hotplug the device, but causes
firefox to segfault when I coldplug the device.
As I get the segfault whether or not I bring the device up, I'm
wondering if there's a problem with the usb subsystem initialization.
Any ideas? Please cc me because I don't usually subscribe to the lkml.
