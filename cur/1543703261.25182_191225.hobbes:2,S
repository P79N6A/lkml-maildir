Err.. no...
I didn't have a 2.6.1-mm3 machine ready to go in our GigE testbed (I'm
busy compiling one up right now). However I did run a quick test on
2.6.0-test11. Iozone rather than bonnie, but the results should be
comparable:

That is admittedly with a (very fast) NetApp filer on the receiving end,
so it is only a Linux client test. However as you can see, I'm basically
flat w.r.t. rereads and rewrites. Client is BTW a PowerEdge 2650 w/
built-in Broadcom BCM5703 (no jumbo frames). Note: with TCP, the numbers
degrade a bit to 81MB/sec write, 82MB/sec rewrite, 135MB/sec read and
144MB/sec reread.
Against a Sun server, I get something a lot slower: 32MB/sec write,
22MB/sec rewrite, 38MB/sec read, 28MB/sec reread using UDP, 29/21/29/26
using TCP. There I do indeed see a slight dip in both the rewrite and
the reread figures.
1 question:
  - Is bonnie doing a close() or an fsync() of the file after if
finishes the write, and before it goes on to testing for rewrites? I
suspect not, in which case your numbers will be strongly skewed.
Cheers,
  Trond
