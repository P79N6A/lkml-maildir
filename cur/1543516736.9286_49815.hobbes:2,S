hi,
I am writing a SCSI HBA driver which is compiled as a module. I get a
panic with the foll:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000002c
current->tss.cr3=0035f000, %cr3=0035f000
*pde=00000000
Entering kdb on processor 0 due to panic @ 0xc28188af
The panic occures during the spin_unlock_irqrestore()
file scsi.c (with some debug printk's inserted), line 2613
if (tpnt->use_new_eh_code) {
       spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock, flags);
       tpnt->present = tpnt->detect(tpnt);
       printk("tpnt->present=%d. line %d file %s\n", tpnt->present,__LINE__,__F 
ILE__);
|----> spin_unlock_irqrestore(&io_request_lock, flags);
|
This is the place where system panics.
       printk("tpnt->present=%d. line %d file %s\n", tpnt->present,__LINE__,__F 
ILE__);
}
The driver is compiled with -D__SMP__.
kernel version : 2.2.10
can anybody tell me what is the problem?
Please get back to me if more info is required.
Thanks in advance,
Raju
