| For those of you who haven't waded through the huge "RFD: Kernel release
| numbering" thread on lkml to realize that we are now going to start
| putting out 2.6.x.y releases, here's the summary:
|
| 	A few of us $suckers will be trying to maintain a 2.6.x.y set of
| 	releases that happen after 2.6.x is released.  It will contain
| 	only a set of bugfixes and security fixes that meet a strict set
| 	of guidelines, as defined by Linus at:
| 		
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/283396
|
| Chris Wright and I are going to start working on doing this work, we
| will have a <SOME_ALIAS>@kernel.org to post these types of bug fixes to,
| and a set of people we bounce the patches off of to test for "smells
| good" validation.  We will also have a bk-commits type mailing list for
| those who want to watch the patches flow in, and a bk tree from which
| changsets can be pulled from.
|
| Chris and I will be hashing all of the details out next Tuesday, and
| hopefully all the infrastructure will be in place soon.  When that
| happens, we will post the full details on how all of this is going to
| work.  In the meantime, feel free to CC: me and Chris on patches that
| everyone thinks should go into the 2.6.11.y releases.
|
| But right now, Chris is on a plane, and we don't have the email alias
| set up, or the proper permissions set up on kernel.org to push changes
| into the v2.6 directory, but we have a few bugs that are needing to be
| fixed in the 2.6.11 release.  And since our mantra is, "release early
| and often", here's the first release.
First of all, congratulation.
I really think this will be a great improvement to the development process.
I couldn't agree more with this decision, it's really what I suggested a
few months ago:

Out of curiosity, are you going to include the -as branch ?
