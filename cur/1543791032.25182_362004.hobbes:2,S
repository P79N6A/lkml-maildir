Subject: [git patch review 4/5] [IB] mthca: Avoid SRQ free WQE list corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/31/302

Fix wqe_to_link() to use a structure field that we know is definitely
always unused for receive work requests, so that it really avoids the
free list corruption bug that the comment claims it does.
