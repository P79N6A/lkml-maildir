I hope not. subarch is one of the main disaster areas in the i386 port.

The comment is out of date, 4.3 has a -march=core2 now.

That one should be on for i386 too. It was a workaround for a gcc prelease
that unfortunately was shipped in a suse release.

And that too should be on for i386 too.

Can be dropped completely now.

Should be on for i386 too (see other mail)

Should be on for i386 too (in fact i thought it was already, surprised)

That is only needed for the unwinder; I readd it on i386 too in the out of tree
unwinder patch. Strictly without it it's not needed, although it can be useful
for kgdb or fireproxy or crash for the gdb unwinder. But that applies to i386 too.
So probably it should be either dropped on both or readded to i386. I would
be for readding. iirc it was dropped because it increased code size slightly,
but code size is not everything. debuggability is more important.
