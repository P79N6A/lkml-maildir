You must have a more magic-special glibc than I do,
pandora{jgg}/tmp#echo "int main(){};" > t.c ; gcc -Os t.c --static; strip
a.out; ls -l a.out
-rwxr-xr-x   1 jgg      Debian     199376 Dec 11 21:37 a.out*
I find the built in bootp very usefull because you don't have to futz with
an initrd, just turn on the option and away you go.
