Subject: [PATCH] Fix hugepage crash on failing mmap()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Andrew/Linus, please apply:
This patch fixes a crash in the hugepage code.  unmap_hugepage_area()
was assuming that (due to prefault) PTEs must exist for all the area
in question.  However, this may not be the case, if mmap() encounters
an error before the prefault and calls unmap_region() to clean up any
partial mapping.
Depending on the hugepage configuration, this crash can be triggered
by an unpriveleged user.
