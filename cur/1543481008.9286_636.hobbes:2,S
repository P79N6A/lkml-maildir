I don't  know this is  a good test  or not, that's  why I figured  out a
new  test. I  make heavy  load with  for example  kernel compiling  with
MAKE=make -j, and paralelly starting processes like this:
tick.sh:
#!/bin/sh
echo "#" >>$1.out
sleep $1
exec tich.sh $1
I should start  it ifor example with the  parameter 1, 2, 4,  8, 16, 32,
64
After  the compilation  finishes,  we have  to look  the  size of  these
files.
The greater  the parameter is,  the size  difference must be  smaller in
different situations and swapping models.
But  We should  look at  the difference  in the  parameter 1,  2, 4,  or
maybe 8.
This could be a good test for interactive speed.
That kernel is better, which produces longer files.
How about this idea? I will try it soon!
