Heh.  I decided to make that really, really, really tiny in the expectation
that if it was _too_ small, someone would notice.
For what workload is the 8 too small, and what is the call path
of the waiters?
(If it is `tiobench 100000000' and the wait is in __writeback_single_inode(),
then we should probably just return from there if !sync and the inode is locked)
