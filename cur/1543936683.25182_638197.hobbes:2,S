Suppress one of the bogus checkpatch.pl error, the side-effect of the error highlighted that this constant should be replaced by an existing manifest. checkpatch.pl needs to be corrected to accept the comment style to deal with the other cases should they ever be touched by future patches. This is a tangled set of coat hangers, tug on one and never know how complicated of a mess might follow!
This attached patch is against current scsi-misc-2.6.
ObligatoryDisclaimer: Please accept my condolences regarding Outlook's handling of patch attachments, use the attachment, not the inline patch.
