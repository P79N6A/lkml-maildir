How large buf does it need? I don't see any spec for that in 2.6.6.
Second, let's just say that while some kernel people think that
converting stuff to ASCII is "neat", I'm not one of them. It's
just a waste of time and space, for both kernel and user-space.
I'd rather do a for-each-CPU loop which strictly keeps to cpumask_t
operations than take a detour via ASCII.
