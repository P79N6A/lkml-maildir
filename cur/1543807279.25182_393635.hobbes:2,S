Good point.
I can easily imagine doing something like the following, to move some
of the logic out of line, rather in the same manner as I did the slab
cache hooks, in "[PATCH 4/5] cpuset memory spread slab cache
optimizations"
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
static struct page *page_cache_alloc_mem_spread_cold(struct address_space *x)
{
	int n = cpuset_mem_spread_node();
	return alloc_pages_node(n, mapping_gfp_mask(x)|__GFP_COLD, 0);
}
static inline struct page *page_cache_alloc_cold(struct address_space *x)
{
	if (cpuset_mem_spread_check())
		return page_cache_alloc_mem_spread_cold(x);
	return alloc_pages(mapping_gfp_mask(x)|__GFP_COLD, 0);
}
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
But I am not sure what you mean by "uninline for certain Kconfig
combinations."  Do you mean uninline these two page_cache_alloc*()
routines, for all configs that enable CONFIG_CPUSET?
    The configs w/o CONFIG_CPUSET have "cpuset_mem_spread_check()"
    defined as a constant 0, so for them, this bloat will disappear,
    so they would not gain any bloat reduction by uninlining these
    page_cache_alloc*() routines, in any case.
    The configs with CONFIG_CPUSET might include future major
    desktop PC distros, which might not want these page_cache_alloc*()
    routines uninlined (though I am sure they would like them to be
    non-bloaty.)
Tell me more.
