When a process opens a file with O_STREAMING, it tells the kernel
it will use the data only once, but it tells nothing about other
tasks. If that process reads something which is already cached,
then it must not drop it because someone other used it recently
and IMHO pagecache only should be allowed to drop it.

If "solution" means "code", sorry, I can't help :(
Bye.
