I agree this is the way to go for 2.6.13 before we fix things the
right way for 2.6.14. Thanks for the patch Paul.

Dunno if it is something in my setup (4 CPU Power5 box with NUMA enabled)
but this patch causes some hard hangs when I run the attached script.
The same script runs for much longer with Ingo's changes but panics
