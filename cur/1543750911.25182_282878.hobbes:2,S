It does happen. I can't give a good estimate of how often. Someone at a
distro may be able to help here, though it's unclear what this specific
point is useful for.
What is a useful observation is that the 2.6-style development model is
not in use in these instances, which instead use the older "frozen"
model. This means that using frozen models in mainline is redundant. The
function and service are available elsewhere and numerous simultaneously
frozen trees guarantees no forward progress during such syzygys.
