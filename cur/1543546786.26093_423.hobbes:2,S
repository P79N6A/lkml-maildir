hmm, if i'm writing a heavy duty server that uses enough kernel threads to
start worrying about the number of stacks in use, then i'm probably not
calling poll().  i'm probably blocking in disk/net reads/writes directly.
i'd only be using poll() if i'm doing userland threads/state-machines.
(i was trying to go through this logic myself when the thread started and
i stopped when i realised that if lots of kernel threads are in use then
there's probably not a lot of common blocking points.)
