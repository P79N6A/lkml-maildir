Yes.

That's not what I was thinking of.  I was thinking of something much simpler:
	struct foo {
		struct timer_list timer;
	};
	...
		struct foo *a = kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo), GFP_KERNEL);
		a->timer.fn = do_foo_timer;
	...
		struct foo *b = kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo), GFP_KERNEL);
		b->timer.fn = do_foo_timer;
	...
		struct foo *c = kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo), GFP_KERNEL);
		c->timer.fn = do_foo_timer;
	...
		struct foo *d = kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo), GFP_KERNEL);
		d->timer.fn = do_foo_timer;
	...
You've now got four copies of struct timer_list, but only one handler.
