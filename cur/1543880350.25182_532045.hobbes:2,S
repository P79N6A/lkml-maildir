This is not correct.
SELinux was designed as an access control framework which allows various 
security models to be composed in a controlled and consistent manner, 
covering all security-relevant interactions in the system.
The type enforcement model included with it provides a means to address 
both integrity and confidentiality requirements.  It _can_ protect you 
against root, if that's what you want (in fact, the Russell Coker "play 
box" was online for many years with a published root password), but it 
does not have to.
Indeed, since Fedora Core 3, the default SELinux policy has been 
"targeted", which is aimed at confining exposed applications.
