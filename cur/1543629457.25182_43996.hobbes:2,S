OK, lest's make a deal you do the following and - realize
immediately that there is a need for single argument
time_past() or whatever and I turn spinlock debugging on :-).
[root@kozaczek linux]# find ./ -name "*.[ch]" -exec grep time_after /dev/null {} 
\; | wc
     265    1638   21285
[root@kozaczek linux]# find ./ -name "*.[ch]" -exec grep time_after /dev/null {} 
\; | grep jiffies | wc
     239    1497   19080
