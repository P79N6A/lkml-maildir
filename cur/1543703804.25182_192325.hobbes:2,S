OK I flashed back and got both.  The message you refer to is at:

The other guy has an a7n8x.  Remember that I have a Shuttle AN35N and the BIOS 
as of 12-5-2003 fixes the lockup.  The change log for this BIOS even includes 
the related "Add C1 disconnect option".  I'm still running the pre-Dec-5 BIOS 
so if there is anything else to try I can do it now.
