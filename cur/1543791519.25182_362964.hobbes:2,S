There were also a few technical reasons.
The first was the desire to create cpusets with 'mkdir my_cpuset'.
But this was not a sufficient reason to have a new filesystem, so after my 
first version of the cpuset patch I reworked it to use sysfs.
However then I ran into a wall: sysfs does not support files larger than a 
page. And this was a showstopper as the size of the `tasks' file can be 
large.
So I had to drop sysfs.
