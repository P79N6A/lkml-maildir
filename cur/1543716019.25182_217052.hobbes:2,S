Hrm...  Yes, it is - we could have chroot(2) called from another thread
while traversing the path to current root and have e.g. umount -l trigger
final umount when d_path() is finished.
Note that we have another blocking function called there anyway - dput()
will happily block under similar conditions (s/umount -l/rm/).
Lovely...  So we need yet another semaphore in swapfile.c (we can't turn
swaplock into semaphore *and* can't reuse swaps_bdev_sem, since dput()
et.al. are not just blocking but can cause any IO and memory allocations).
I'll try to put together something not too revolting; will post the patch
in a followup...
