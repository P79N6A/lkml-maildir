Making the pte clean also needs to clear the hardware writable
bit on architectures where we do pte dirtying in software.
If we don't, we would have corruption problems all over the VM,
for example in the code around pte_clean_one :)

Nowhere near as expensive as a full page fault, though...
The lazy freeing is aimed at avoiding page faults on memory
that is freed and later realloced, which is quite a common
thing in many workloads.
