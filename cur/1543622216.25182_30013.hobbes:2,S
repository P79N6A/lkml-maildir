Well, I still do not know the answer; when I started to investigate it
decided to work and I am running it right now.  Bootloader not in a
mood?  Quite possible.  Boot commands used with 2.4.18-rc1 and
2.4.18-rc4 differ by one character (more precisely, a digit :-).  Sorry
for a premature alarm.
BTW - I noticed that although I wrote that Monday I failed to mention
this in the message quoted.  The machine is Alpha (Nautilus).
