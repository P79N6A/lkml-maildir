Obviously impossible.  For one thing, there might very well be no inode,
let alone struct file, associated with bio in question (e.g. for any
filesystem metadata).  Moreover, the same on-disk object may get IO
without any stuct file at all (e.g. a directory) or with many struct
file (e.g. any file independently opened by several processes; no matter
how many of them do reads, we'll get stuff pulled into page cache the
same way (and once, not once per struct file).
