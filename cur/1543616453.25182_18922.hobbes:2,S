We ran memtest86 at one point but it showed nothing. We changed the memory
modules, and it didn't help. (I did seem like the order and placement of the
modules on the mobo made difference, but that turned out to be false
positive. Trying harder made the corruption happen again.)
Also, we only begun to see oopses when we stress tested hpt370 ide AND
network (so far we did only stress hpt370 and run "normal" stuff). The board
never oopsed or behaved strangely other than the hpt370 corruption and the
hpt370+3c905 stress test oopses.

If we get around to replace the bugger, the one thing I'll make sure is that
the replacement is not Via. Even if 1000 people told me KT266A was stable.
