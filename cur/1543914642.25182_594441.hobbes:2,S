It's far more complex as the thing which is implemented there.
The only thing that has been implemented is that one moduleformat
can be loaded by the v4l and by the dvb framework nothing else at the
moment. I told you at the kernel summit about that and I think you
knew about that before.
Just to quote some text:
"Right now, a separate instance of the driver is used for analog /
digital tuning.  In order to use a single instance, we will have to
store a pointer to the dvb_frontend structure on the bridge level, but
there are various other prerequisites that must be dealt with before we
get to that point.
We _will_ get there though, eventually."

Let me quote some text where you've been in CC and which didn't get
far enough to get a solution implemented.

We cannot add new standards for each of these files because only six
bits are unassigned in the lower half of v4l2_std_id. It seems
unecessary too, please correct me if I'm wrong.
(Well the driver could define its own video standards for each of the
firmwares and put them into the upper 32 bits of v4l2_std_id, which were
set aside for this purpose. But adding standards to the API also has its
advantages. Maybe it's time to reserve bits 40-55 for future expansion.)
I suppose you choose firmwares with IF or baseband sound output
depending on the design of the card?"

I pointed out a few requirements which didn't get commented at all, and
I explained why things where done in a particular way.
