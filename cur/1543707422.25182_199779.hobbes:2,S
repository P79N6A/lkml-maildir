There is still a call to do_munmap() that does not check the return 
code, called from move_vma(), which in turn is called in do_mremap().
Can that call ever fail and cause Bad Things to happen?
If we know that its never going to fail, it might be useful to have a 
comment explaining it so we don't open up more exploits in the future.
