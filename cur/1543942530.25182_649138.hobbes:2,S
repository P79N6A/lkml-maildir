Yes. That's what I meant. I don't think overall per process setting is that useful.
Per thread though would be useful.
How to expose that to the user-space ? The best option in my opinion is to extend
struct sched_param. That way both sched_setparam() and pthread_attr_setschedparam() 
can be used to set new attributes and it's backwards compatible.
Something like:
struct sched_param {
	...
	unsigned int sched_rt_limit;
	unsigned int sched_rt_...;
};
