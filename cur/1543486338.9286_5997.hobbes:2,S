As someone trying to actually deploy 80+ GB
RAIDed database servers right now on Linux, I can
certainly second Stephen's opinion. About the
*only* problem with ext2 right now is the
long fsck times. I've attached some measurements
to show you how serious the problem is.

To measure fsck performance, since it took about 2 hours
to actually *fill* the drive to 11% full, I had to resort
to extrapolation. Here are my hard results.
        % Disk full     Data blocks     Time    
        ---------------------------------------------
         5%             3881184         5m35s (335s)
         7%             6015252         7m33s (453s)
        11%             8961576         9m59s (599s)
The data consisted of numerous copies of /usr/doc from
RedHat, therefore it's a fairly representative mix of
small files.
Extrapolating using an *extremely dodgy* linear
approximation gives the following estimates:
        50%                             40m (2400s)
        90%                             66m40s (4000s)
