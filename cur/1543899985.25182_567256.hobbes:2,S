I'm not versed with all this EDID and resolution stuff, but shouldn't 
the resolution be detected correctly under all configurations?
The original problem is that as of 2.6.20.11, the resolution is 
misdetected - it is wrong by 6 pixels. The same configuration with 
2.6.20.10 works fine.
With the 2.6.20.10/2.6.20.11 configuration, the user did have 
CONFIG_FIRMWARE_EDID set. I'm not sure why he changed this for the -mm 
testing, but then again I don't understand why it should matter.
