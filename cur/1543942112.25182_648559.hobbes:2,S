I tested now on the same machine, outside of VMware: It is blazing fast, 
just as it should be - kernel release 2.6.18.8-0.5-ZMI, where -ZMI 
means I compiled the kernel myself. Still, it runs quick within the VM 
with kernel 2.6.13-15.15-smp from SUSE 10.0, but slow with more recent 
kernels (I couldn't test every combination of course). 
I tried but cannot compile 2.6.13 within SUSE 10.3, it gives lots of 
errors because libs changed.
It would be very nice to find the source of the problem. I uploaded the 
kernel config options files onto my server for reference, HTH:
VMware with SUSE 10.0 and fast netatalk/samba:
http://zmi.at/x/config2.6.13-15.15.txt
VMware host, outside of VMware, also fast:
http://zmi.at/x/config2.6.18.8-host.txt
VMware with SUSE 10.2 and kernel 2.6.22-9-ZMI, slow:
http://zmi.at/x/config2.6.22.9-slow.txt
VMware with SUSE 10.3 and kernel 2.6.23.13-ZMI, slow:
http://zmi.at/x/config2.6.23.13-slow.txt
The problem seems to be somewhere between the kernel and VMware, but I 
do not know what to do.
