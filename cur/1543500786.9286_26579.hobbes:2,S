How about hacks to the traffic shaper on the client machines? Choose some
distribution function for bandwidth and latency for clients and randomly
generate pipes that accommodate said parameters. Right now, of course,
shaper only does bandwidth, since no one in RL wants to add latency, but
it should be doable without too much pain. We can also make shaper do a
more realistic simulation of congestion to generate stalls, etc.
