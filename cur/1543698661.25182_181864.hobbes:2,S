Just a quick followup.  I haven't booted into a Non-SMP kernel yet,
but when I compiled it, I got the following error:
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms1.S
  AS      .tmp_kallsyms1.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux2
  KSYM    .tmp_kallsyms2.S
  AS      .tmp_kallsyms2.o
  LD      vmlinux
  AS      arch/i386/boot/setup.o
arch/i386/boot/setup.S: Assembler messages:
arch/i386/boot/setup.S:165: Warning: value 0x37ffffff truncated to

  LD      arch/i386/boot/setup
  OBJCOPY arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin
  GZIP    arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin.gz
  LD      arch/i386/boot/compressed/piggy.o
  LD      arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux
  OBJCOPY arch/i386/boot/vmlinux.bin
  BUILD   arch/i386/boot/bzImage
I'm not sure if this is a valid error, or just a tool chain issue.
Some too versions:
gcc 3.3.2 (Debian)
as  2.14.90.0.7 20031029 Debian GNU/Linux
