git bisect is _really_ simple if you already have a git tree anyway. And 
even if you don't, getting one isn't really hard either. Just do
	git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git linux-2.6
and you have a tree (it will take a little while - it's going to dowload 
about 170MB or so of stuff, so the initial clone is going to be a bit 
painful unless you have a fast internet connection).
Once you have the git tree, assuming that 2.6.21-rc7 worked for you, it's 
really as easy as just saying
	git bisect start
	git bisect good v2.6.21-rc7
	git bisect bad v2.6.21
and git will think for a short while (most of the time is going to be 
checking out the new tree) and give you a tree to test.
Just build, boot, and test that tree.
If it was fine, do
	git bisect good
and git will pick a new tree to test. And if it wasn't, instead just do 
"git bisect bad", and git will pick _another_ version to test. Do this a 
few times, and git will tell you which commit introduced them.
There were just 125 commits in between 2.6.21-rc7 and the final one, so it 
should be quite quick - bisection basically does a binary search, so doing 
seven reboots should have you with the result.
The fact that it already works in 2.6.21-git2 obviously means that _I_ end 
up being less interested, but the -stable tree people would love to hear 
what broke!

Yes. But if you cannot be polite and *RESPECTFUL*, you won't get anywhere 
at all.
This is Linux, not Windows. But that also means that those developers that 
you denigrate aren't getting paid by you, and if you don't show them 
respect, they'll totally ignore you.
