I have a spare Alpha box (in theory I made need it some day if we ever
decide to support Tru64 but that seems like a small market).  I don't 
know how useful it is but I could put it up outside our firewall if 
that helped.  I'd have to install Linux on it and I'm booked up until
Jan 9th but if you still need it then let me know.
