It has, one time in 35 hours now.  The problem is considerably 
reduced.
Whereas the error was always at an odd address, and in the 2nd LSbyte, 
now its still an odd address but the error has moved to the MSB of a 
32 bit fetch:
[root@coyote memburn]# ./memburn 512
Starting test with size 512 megs..
Passed round 2308, elapsed 41225.98.
FAILED at round 2309/40220063: got ff000000, expected 00000000!!!
REREAD: ff000000, ff000000, ff000000!!!
[root@coyote memburn]# ./memburn 512
Starting test with size 512 megs..
Passed round 2636, elapsed 60944.15.
As can be seen, I restarted it, and its ran quite even more loops now 
without error.  There has been no more Oops, but with memburn eating 
512 megs, half my ram, and kde-3.3 under construction by konstruct, 
I've peaked at nearly a gig of swap, and 754 megs in swap right now.  
Sure, its a bit laggy, but not unusable.
So now the question is since the error address is always odd, which 
stick is it?
Or do I need to sanitize the dimm sockets somehow?
They sure seem to slip in and out easy enough for a socket with that 
many contacts. Not over 3 pounds on each end will seat them, and if 
the clips are re-opened they virtually fall out into your hand.  I'm 
rather more used to having to press 5 to 10 pounds on each end to 
seat them.
Next time I have to reboot, I'm going to 'exercise' them in and out a 
few times just to polish the oxide from the contacts.
