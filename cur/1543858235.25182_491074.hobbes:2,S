in fs/read_write.c, the vfs_read function does:
file->f_op->read(file, buf, count, pos);
after this call is it possible to determine where the
data is coming from? e.g., the first hard disk, a pipe
or from a socket. If it is a socket we are interested
from which device (eth0, eth1, lo, ...) the data was received.
