Correct.  I am amazed Keith missed this...  changing data in Makefile
can certainly affect the entire kernel compile, so it makes sense to
recompile the entire kernel when it changes.
If we want to change this, one must isolate the specific changes which
cause the entire kernel (or just init/main.c) to be recompiled, and
put those in a separate file.

ditto :)  my kbuild script looks basically like:
make distclean && cp <kconfig dir>/rum .config && make oldconfig &&
make oldconfig && make -j3 dep && make -j3 && make modules && make boot
