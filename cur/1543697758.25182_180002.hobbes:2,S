Most of these are SCSI issues and the last one makes -test10 hard to debug.
* MESH gets SLAB errors during startup, CDROM eject
* "mac53c94: module license 'unspecified' taints kernel."
* "53C94 did not call scsi_unregister" [sorry, should have filed bug report]
* 'swim3.c' doesn't compile properly
* Switching from X to text console ('controlfb' frame buffer) loses video 
  sync.
The 53C94 problems probably aren't hard to fix.  For the floppy code (that 
is, 'swim3.c'), 'benh' has a version of 'swim3' which may only need further
testing.  The MESH issue looks like a buffer alignment problem, and worked 
without complaint in the 2.4 kernels.  
The video mode problem is a real nuisance and is the biggest reason i'm not
doing more than intermittent testing of 2.6.0/PPC.

P.S.  I came across a large pile of floppies during a massive cleanup (why
i've been so busy) and i can run some more tests of the 'swim3' code after 
the Thanksgiving break.
