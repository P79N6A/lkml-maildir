How do you get 40 physical bits in a 32bit page table entry? My memory
is that the low bits in the page table entry were well defined and
accounted for. I'm pretty certain I can account for 6 of the low bits
off the top of my head.  PSE is the page size extension allowing pages 2MB/4MB
pages.  
PAE (physical address extension) gives you a 64bit page table entry
and where you have a place for all of those extra physical bits kick
as I recall.  The limit is 52 bits and current cpus talk about support
40 bits with AMD in the process of going to 48 bits.
Is there a feature I have overlooked?  
That would allow 40 bits with PSE?

Thanks.  Sorry for being a pain.
