Richard, you do not seem to understand.
The highmem approach gets everything right, and has basically zero
performance impact.
"all devices converted" is not even _close_ to true.  You'll end up with
horrible configuration problems, where people don't even realize that one
of the drivers (or perhaps a module) isn't necessarily safe.
Yes, _your_ machine may have all drivers converted, and _you_ may know
that that is true. But what about a regular user, who has to find out the
hard way?
