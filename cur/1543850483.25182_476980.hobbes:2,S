Subject: [PATCH] workqueue: update kerneldoc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/27/118

This patch (as812) changes the kerneldoc comments explaining the
return values from queue_work(), queue_delayed_work(), and
queue_delayed_work_on().  The updated comments explain more
accurately the meaning of the return code and avoid suggesting that a
0 value means the routine was unsuccessful.

Andrew:
After seeing how queue_work() and schedule_work() are used in practice,
and in view of the recent discussion (concerning the PCI MWI routine)  
about when it's appropriate to return an error code as opposed to just
returning a non-zero value, I decided there wasn't any need to change
queue_work() and friends.
The 0 value they return is not a sign of an error; it simply means 
that the work_struct had already been added to a workqueue.  The best way 
to clear up any confusion is simply to improve the kerneldoc comment.
