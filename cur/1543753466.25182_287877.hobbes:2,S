Thanks for those. If you don't know what to make of the dsp variation 
and the crashing then I'm not sure what I should make of it either. It's 
highly likely that my code still needs fixing to ensure it behaves as 
expected. Already one bug has been picked up in testing with respect to 
yield() so there may be others. By design, if you set iso_cpu to 100 it 
should be as good as SCHED_RR. If not, then the implementation is still 
buggy.
