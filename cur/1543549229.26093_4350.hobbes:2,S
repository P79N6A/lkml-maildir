This should probably be handled in arch-dependant code. So make a
pci_enable_device() per arch. The point beeing that only this code has a
chance to know some of the details of the PCI implementation on this
platform/arch. Bus master and MemWI don't hurt, but I guess enabling
parity can halt the bus. So you want to be careful... So:
static inline int pci_enable_device(struct pci_device *dev)
{
	return pci_enable_device_features(~ENABLE_NONE);
}
and let pci_enable_device_features() chose which features make sense/are
safe.
