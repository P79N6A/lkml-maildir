I think we all agree that it should not be a Unix signal, if only
because glibc cannot manipulate memory pools from signal handlers :)
The low memory message (for lack of a better word) needs to get to
userspace over a file descriptor, which the process can select() or
poll() on from its main loop.
Whether that is a device node, a sysfs file, a netlink socket or
something else ... I don't particularly care :)
