     Or thinking that the two filesystems are the same.
     As you point out, the gotchas won't happen very often, but they
     will happen.
     I'd love to see dev_t pushed out to some unreasonable size (even
     with d*vfs; plan-9 namespaces are great, but backwards
     compatability is better) and the kernel version bumped up to 3.0 --
     this would give a wonderful opportunity to widen out some of the
     overly constrained entry points (with a update document saying
     ``EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WRITTEN HAS JUST BROKEN.  RECOMPILE IT
     ALL'', or the FreeBSD linux emulator could be ported to Linux
     for pdp-11, er, pre 3.0 code.) as well as discard some of the
     old interfaces (like the old fcntl interfaces.)

     It would give me a good opportunity to do libc7 and take out gnu
     db and curses, too.
                   ____
     david parsons \bi/ and with 3.0, we could put UDI into the kernel
                    \/  and start scavenging device drivers from other
			                             operating systems.
