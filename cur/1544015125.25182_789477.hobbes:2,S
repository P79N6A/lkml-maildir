What other ways exist so I can see what the heck davem did to
arch/sparc64/kernel/irq.c then?
I know he added IRQ stacks - but how did the patch look like?
I know no other way to find the old history than to do:
    git log --follow arch/sparc/kernel/irq_64.c
But this also give me what I want. I'm just curious if there is
a better way - in the case where you know the old name.
