Hello,
I am Ruinning a (SuSE patched) 2.4.18 kernel and encountered the fdisk 
repartition problem mentioned above. I know that I could solve the problem by 
rebooting but I am interested if this is really needed since in my case a 
data recovery job was finally killed after 12 hours because there was not 
enough RAM or SWAP. I saw already very early that there could be a problem 
with swap and there was enough unpartitioned disk space to add swap, but the 
kernel would not let me. 
What I did was to add a partition on a disk that has other mounted (e.g. root) 
partitions on it. I did not change the numbering or positions of any of the 
partitions in use.The new partition was simply added after all existing 
partitions.
 
So the question is why does the kernel deny to reread the partiton table and 
force me to reboot instaed of simply doing the reread? Are there any good 
reasons for this "bad" behaviour?
Thanks
Rainer
