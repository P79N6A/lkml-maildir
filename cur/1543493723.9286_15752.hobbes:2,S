Ok...  I recompiled my kernel to include magic sysrequest.  I figure I
will leave this on with ever kernel I compile so I can try and help any
way possiable.  Anyhow...  I think I may have found my problem...  it may
not be software.  I think my CPU voltage may be fluctuating way out of
bounds.  I have lm_sensors running and I jsut found out that the hardware
monitering script is not running @ boot for some reason...  I am going to
try and figure this one out tonight.  Where is a good source for reading
about conf.modules?  I need to make it load all of the sensors package and
not unload them.  To cut to the chase...  I started health monitering by
hand and within about 2 hours my machine halted itself.  I use lm_sensors
to halt the machine because I figure and idle processor with fan will cool
faster than if the machine jsut shut off and had no cooling fans.  but
when I booted back up and looked at the error message that the health
script spit out before it shutdown it was an undervolt on CPU 0...  I have
already increased the tolerances quite a bit.  It was running a 2 volt
core at 1.90 volts.  Is this enough to cause errors?  I think the machine
is on the same power as my fridge...  Could this be causing it?  Also...
what temp should a PII run @ under full load.
