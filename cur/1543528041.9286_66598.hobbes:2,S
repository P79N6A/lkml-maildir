The sym53c8xx driver now trusts the data transfer direction of SCSI
commands supplied by upper layers. If this information is wrong, this will
not work. (I will try to let the driver detect properly bad data phase in
some further driver version).
My-be, the application you are using sends an IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND to some
drivers and if a non zero input buffer length is provided direction is
assumed WRITE by scsi_ioctl.c, which is wrong for INQUIRY (just guessing). 
You can revert previous sym53c8xx driver behaviour by manually changing
the following line in sym53c8xx.c: 
-#ifdef	SCSI_DATA_UNKNOWN
+#if 0
If hacking the driver this way fixes the problem, then either scsi_ioctl.c
or the `xmdc' program may have to be fixed. 
Gérard.
