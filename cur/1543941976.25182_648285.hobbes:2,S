Hmm, this _could_ be bad memory. Or if it is very easy to reproduce with
a particular kernel version, then it is probably a memory scribble from
another part of the kernel :(
First thing I guess would be easy and helpful to run memtest86 for a
while if you have time.
If that's clean, then I don't have another good option except to bisect
the problem. Turning on DEBUG_VM, DEBUG_SLAB, DEBUG_LIST, DEBUG_PAGEALLOC,
DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW, DEBUG_RODATA might help catch it sooner... SLAB and
PAGEALLOC could slow you down quite a bit though. And if the problem is
quite reproduceable, then obviously don't touch your config ;)
Thanks,
Nick
