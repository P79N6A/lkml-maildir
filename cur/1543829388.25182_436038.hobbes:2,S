Nate, you should note that A: increasing to 80% was my idea, and B: the
data from the benchmarks provide no indication that it is a good idea.
That said, it is very possible that C: the benchmark is flawed, because
the variance is so high that I am suspicious that something is wrong
with the benchmark, and D: that the implementation is flawed in some way
we don't yet see.
All that said, I cannot say that we have anything here that suggests the
change is a good change.   My intuition says it should be a good change,
but the data does not.  Not yet.
