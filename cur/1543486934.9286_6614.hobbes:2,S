Are there any adverse effects to adding a field to `struct inode'?
I would like to add `u32  i_generation' for the reasons outlined
below.
NFS is in need of an inode generation number for correctness and
possibly some added security.  The best way to do this is by adding
a u32 variable to struct inode.
H.J. originally was going to put jiffies into this field, and so
he named the variable i_timestamp, however i_generation seems
a more descriptive name.  But I will gladly take suggestions.
The value that is put into this field will be up to each filesystem.
The only requirement is that the generation count only change if
i_nlink reaches zero (the file is deleted). 
No change will be needed to filesystems that do not wish to, or
can't supply a generation count.
kernel NFSD needs this for the case where a file is deleted and
then a new file is created with the same ino.  An attempt to access
the original file should fail, and not read the new file.  This is
a problem on ext2 because it likes to reuse an inode that was just
deleted.  On systems that use a round-robin aproach to selecting
an inode this is not as important.
The added security comes from the fact that the client either
has to make a call to MOUNT or has to guess the generation
count of an inode.
