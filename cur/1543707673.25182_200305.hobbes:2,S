While I agree in principle that DN_IGNORE_SELF would be quite an
effective and clean way to solve the Samba problem and also
applicable to other situations, I also imagine that the value of
DN_IGNORE_SELF would be greatly affected by how the "self" is
defined.  A server implementation may be multithreaded, and you
may or may not want to count all your threads in that server
process as self; another may be implemented as one master
process spawning multiple worker bee processes, in which case it
would be more convenient if all the processes in one process
group is counted as self.
