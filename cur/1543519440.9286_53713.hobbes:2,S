Hi all.

I'm not sure quite what's being said here, but it looks like different
people are talking about different things. Since I make use of BOTH of
the things I think are being referred to, can I paint my scenario and
ask whether it will continue to work?
First, I have the following:
 Q> # ls -Gl /cdrom /dev/cdrom | tr -s '\t' ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 8-
 Q> /cdrom -> /home/ftp/cdrom
 Q> /dev/cdrom -> /dev/hdd
 Q> # grep cdrom /etc/fstab | tr -s '\t' ' '
 Q> /dev/cdrom /home/ftp/cdrom iso9660 defaults,noauto,ro,user
 Q> #
I mount the CD drive by typing the following command...
 Q> mount /cdrom
...after which it is mounted as per the line from /etc/fstab listed
above, which suits me fine. Will this continue to work?
From my reading of the comments quoted, it looks like one person is
referring to whether mount should follow the /dev/cdrom symlink and
the other is referring to whether it should follow the /cdrom symlink
in my listing, and those serve different purposes.
Best wishes from Riley.
