   Apparently, the recent 2.1.x kernels, and the 2.2.0-pres are less tolerent
   of serial ports using the same irq. After checking my inittab, and
   commenting out the getty that was sitting on ttyS3, all was well with
   ttyS1 again. All the 2.0.x kernels had no problems accessing ttyS1, with
   the getty running on ttyS3.
That's actually a matter of how the serial driver is configured.  If you
explicitly allow IRQ sharing, then the serial driver will allow it.  But
since most hardware doesn't work with IRQ sharing (certainly normal COM
1/2/3/4 hardware does not work with IRQ sharing), and the code to
support IRQ sharing took up valuable memory, it's not a compile-time
option in the kernel.
