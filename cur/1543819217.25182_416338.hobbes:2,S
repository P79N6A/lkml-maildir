Since DIE_PAGE_FAULT is the one which come in performance path, I think
this should be optimised and I would suggest just making 
notify_die(DIE_PAGE_FAULT,..) into a seperate notifier chains (something like
notify_page_fault() which calls just the registered handlers).
In this way, in the performance critical path, we will be calling only the
required handlers(probally only the kprobes handlers) and not the whole world
registered on notify_die() call chain.
