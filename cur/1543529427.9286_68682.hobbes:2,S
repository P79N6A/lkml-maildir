	To do what?  I'm putting in the devfs support now.  How does that
fix the fact that he didn't impliment the links he claimed to impliment
in devfsd.  Ok...  He really didn't claim he implimented ALL of them, it
was just sort of implied in some of the README files, so I guess he has
an excuse.
	Actually, the devfs support is in and working (which is why I know
the support in devfsd is NOT in and not working) I just have to hunt down
an interrupt bug introduced by another fix before I can submit it.
	So...  Even after the devfs support is submitted and integrated,
the devfsd is not going to help you with compatibility with the old links.
Actually, it will...  I'm working on the changes to the devfsd.conf file
to add the missing support at that level.  It just means you have to
modify yet another config file.
