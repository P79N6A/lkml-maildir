Looks promising so far.
I'm currently porting selinuxfs funtionality to securityfs, although I'm
not sure if we'll be ok during early initialization.  selinuxfs is
currently kern_mounted via an initcall.  We may need an initcall
kern_mount() of securityfs before SELinux kicks in.
Stephen: opinions on this?
Otherwise, it looks like it'll allow SELinux to drop some code.  Generally 
it will mean that other LSM components won't have to create their own 
filesystems, and their subdirectories will be hanging off /security (or 
wherever selinuxfs is mounted), rather than scattered across /
Some of the SELinux code may be useful as part of securityfs later, as 
well.

How about having all API functions which return a pointer be converted to 
use ERR_PTR() ?
This will allow errors to be propagated to the calling code.
