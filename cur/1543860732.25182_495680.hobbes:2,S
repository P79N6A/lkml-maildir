That's the wrong way around.  Work is underway to instead
have the devicetreefs *use* the in-kernel interfaces.  Would
that be acceptable?

Neither do I :-)

All should converge on the same interface.  That does not
ab initio mean we should converge on what you currently
have (although that might eventually be that case).

Leaving aside the issue of in-memory or not, I don't think
it is realistic to think any completely common implementation
will work for this -- it might for current SPARC+PowerPC+OLPC,
but more stuff will be added over time...
