Ah, so it was about your documentation work.  I already forgot the
context of your previous inquiries.  Alas the tone of them already did
some damage, leading to responses like these.

The Linux SCSI subsystems don't consume, they provide services; nowadays
not only for SCSI hardware and SCSI protocols but also for a number of
subsystems whose tasks are similar enough to SCSI subsystems to make the
SCSI core and upper SCSI layer useful to them too.
BTW:

As a side note, SBP-2 is a SCSI transport protocol, hence ieee1394/sbp2
and firewire/fw-sbp2 are Linux SCSI low-level drivers.  Anything else
would be just wrong and infeasible in this particular case.
