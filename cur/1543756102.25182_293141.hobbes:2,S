Is there any gain in changing name to do_taskfile()?

this is user-space visible change
(it is right thing to do, I just wanted to point the fact)

The check may be needed.  AFAIR drive->mult_count may change
before our taskfile request is started.

I guess you mean ->tf_in_flags?

This patch looks much better but could you move writing taskfile
registers to separate helpers (one for non-flagged and one for flagged)?
Probably splitting non-flagged taskfile load helper off do_rw_taskfile()
should be done in separate patch.  We can then use this helper in
ide-disk.c for __ide_do_rw_taskfile() (we can't do direct conversion
to do_rw_taskfile() yet for various reasons).
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
