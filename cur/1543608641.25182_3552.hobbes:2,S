Come on.  Regardless of the quality of new code (I hadn't looked at the
patched tree yet, but from the look at patch itself locking is heavily
overdone, so my gut feeling is that there are deadlocks), it's no worse
than the old one.
I.e. as long as it doesn't touch the rest of tree, situation hadn't
become worse.  Usual arguments re lost testing obviously do not apply -
replaced code is known to be broken _and_ impossible to fix without a
massive rewrite.  So all old testing had been worthless anyway.
