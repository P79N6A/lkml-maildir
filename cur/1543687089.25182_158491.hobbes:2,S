Everything points to it being a fault handler.
Here's my current understanding:
 some part of X calls sys_vm86()
 sys_vm86 stashes pointer to userspace structure
 do_sys_vm86 fiddles with register structures to setup 16-bit transition
 do_sys_vm86 goes to 16-bit mode _through the userspace return path_
 fault occurs in 16-bit code
 handle_vm86_fault invoked through interrupt
 save_v86_state writes into stashed userspace structure (might_sleep)
 return_to_32bit swaps register sets around
 return_to_32bit returns to the original userspace context
Because we never return to the context of the sys_vm86 syscall, we're
never again in an appropriate place to copy the registers over. A
cleaner way to do this is to setup return_to_32bit to return to the
point just after where sys_vm86 returns to 16bit mode and copy the
registers to userspace in normal process context.
