So what happened to this thread?  Was I simply removed from the Cc, or
did the thread cease?  Or is there a "secret" fix on vendor-sec?
I'm probably the person in this thread who understands the least about
the USB stack and the scheduler, but if there is no implementation of
Linus' suggested "PID approach" yet, I'd be willing to write a patch and
test it. Please let me know.
Please also understand that I never argued that my initial patch was a
good solution, or that I wanted it to have merged.  I just wanted to
show that there is a real-world problem, and it somehow needs to be fixed.
Cheers,
