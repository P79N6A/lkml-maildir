Subject: [ANNOUNCE] 2003-08-05 release of hotplug scripts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've just packaged up the latest Linux hotplug scripts into a release,
which can be found at:
 	
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17679
Or from your favorite kernel.org mirror at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_08_05.tar.gz
or for those who like bz2 packages:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_08_05.tar.bz2
I've also packaged up some pre-built (and signed) Red Hat 7.3 based rpms:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_08_05-1_rh73.noarch.rpm
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-base-2003_08_05-1_rh73.noarch.rpm
and some pre-built (and signed) Red Hat 9 based rpms:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_08_05-1_rh9.noarch.rpm
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-base-2003_08_05-1_rh9.noarch.rpm
The source rpm is available if you want to rebuild it for other distros
or versions of Red Hat at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_08_05-1_rh73.src.rpm
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_08_05-1_rh9.src.rpm
The main web site for the linux-hotplug project can be found at:
	
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net/
which contains lots of documentation on the whole linux-hotplug
process.
This release is recommended for _anyone_ using the 2.6.0-test and beyond
kernels, as a number of changes have been made in order to support the recent
kernel changes.  These include:
	- fix usb autoloading of modules for 2.6 (it wasn't working).
	- changed network code to accept 2.5's change to the way network
	  interfaces are brought up and down (now "add" and "remove"
	  like all the other hotplug types.)
The release is still backwards compatible with 2.4, so there is no need
to worry about upgrading.
The full ChangeLog extract since the last release is included below for
those who want to know everything that's been changed, and who to blame
for them :)
thanks,
greg k-h
