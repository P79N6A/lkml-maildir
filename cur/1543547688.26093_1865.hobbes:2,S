I rolled spliffs in Germany.  Was used to make them from turkish tobacco
and red hash you could buy at Gruneberg Park in Frankfurt for 40 DM a
stick when I was in my early 20's -- long time though.  It's not a
joke.  It'w withdrawn until June 2001.  
And I have not drank since last year.  I don't drink -- this is Utah. 
Where can you buy booze around here?
