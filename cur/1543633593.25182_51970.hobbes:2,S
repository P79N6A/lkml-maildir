  Over about past week there has been some talk with that topic.
  The conclusion appeared to be "kernel driver is abandoned, future
  support belongs into  mtools".
  Thread Subject was something like  "fat/msdos/...".
  Go see the archives.
  (And having word "fat" in message subject does cause several
   sites to consider even this message to be spam...)
