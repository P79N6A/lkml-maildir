My conclusion is different.  We should make kobject_init() not consume
any resources at all; just initialize various fields.  That way it
would be okay to call either kfree() or kobject_put() on an initialized
kobject.  And then when something like device_register() fails, the
caller would know the proper thing to do would be to call the put()  
routine, always.
Of course, once the name has been assigned, only kobject_put() should
be used.
There's another good reason for not assigning the name in
kobject_init(): Code that uses kobjects (like the driver core) doesn't
set the name until later.
