This is not true; AGP works perfectly fine with the in-kernel drivers. 
You can set your video card to use the in-kernel AGP even if it is 
Nvidia, I think (use the NvAgp option in XF86Config).
If not, maybe the patch has not been updated for the latest kernels, and 
you will have to wait for someone to do so. In that case, this list is 
not the place to ask.
