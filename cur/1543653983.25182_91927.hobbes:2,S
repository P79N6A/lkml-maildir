	By yielding your time slice, you prevent yourself from performing any 
'read's. So what's going to fix the memory pressure?
	There are two cases where this could work:
	1) For an application that uses very little TCP memory. By yielding, perhaps 
some other process will come along, a more heavy TCP memory user, and fix the 
problem.
	2) For an application that uses a thread-per-connection architecture. By 
yielding, we give other threads a chance to run and hope that they will 
relieve the memory pressure.
	But for a poll/select loop application that is heavily using TCP memory, 
this makes things worse. By stopping our own execution, we delay the time 
when we'll do 'read's. So we extend the TCP memory pressure problem for even 
longer.
