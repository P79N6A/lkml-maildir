They are wrong then. atomic instructions is the wrong implementation
and they would be better off with asm-generic. 
If anything they should use per_cpu counters for interrupts and 
use seq locks. Or just turn off the interrupts for a short time
in the low level code.

I think it is better to fix the other architectures then - if they
are really using a full scale bus lock for this they're just wrong.
I don't think it is a good idea to do a large change in generic
code just for dumb low level code.
