Hmmm, well that's exactly what UML does and its packets are treated in
exactly the way you seem to want.  They are treated as coming from a totally
different machine (although UML, as a complete machine, has a complete network
stack, network devices with their own IP addresses, etc, so you might just
not be making your packets look "remote" enough).
