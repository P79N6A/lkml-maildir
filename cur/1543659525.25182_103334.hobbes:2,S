According to Russell King, yes.
The PA-RISC one should also be correct.  Actually, to be honest, there's a 
longstanding issue in the pa-risc code where we can potentially allocate a 
page table using GFP_KERNEL in pci_alloc_consistent() when we obtain the 
mapping resources.  I can argue that we never go down this path in practice, 
but it does make GFP_ATOMIC allocations look unsafe on the platform.
