Subject: [PATCH] pcmcia: update alloc_io_space for conflict checking for multifunction PC card
Some PCMCIA cards do not mention specific IO addresses in the CIS.  In that
case, inside the alloc_io_space function, conflicts are detected (the
function returns 1) for the second function of a multifunction card unless
the length of IO address range required is greater than 0x100.
The following patch will remove this conflict checking for a PCMCIA
function which had not mentioned any specific IO address to be mapped from.
The patch is tested for Linux kernel 2.6.15.4 and works fine in the above
case and is as suggested by Dave Hinds.
