Hello there.
I finally managed to try out the voluntary preemption patch (H9 on 2.6.8-rc2).
The syslog got flooded by these
bad: ksoftirqd/0(2) scheduling while atomic (1)!

[<c012b4c0>] kthread+0x0/0xb0
[<c0103d91>] kernel_thread_helper+0x5/0x14
Is this by any means normal?
If it is, can these messages be turned off? (Note that I want to have
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL on to be able to use the magic SysRq key.)
Bye for now.
Rudo.
