Hi,
want to summarize my observations wrt the VM-deadlock issue. Everything
tested on UP box bootet with mem=8M and 500M swap.
2.4.0-t9p4 (vanilla)
     deadlocks almost everywhere (even in initscripts!), simple dd with
     large enough bs deadlock's as soon as page_out should start - i.e. no
     swapspace ever used. Fortunately, deadlock can be cured by SysRq+e.
2.4.0-t9p5+vmfixes-2.4.0-test9-A1
     much better, but still some deadlock. Much harder to trigger in a
     reproducible way. "make dep" on /usr/src/linux seems to be a good
     candidate, initscripts too. At some time some (undetermined) process
     hangs - this process remains the only one ever being current forever!
     However EIP still changes according to SysRq+p. This behaviour can
     not be solved by SysRq+[ekil]. SysRq+[sb] not succesful either,
     so its time for unclean reboot und fsck (which deadlocks too).
2.4.0-t9p6 (vanilla)
     very similar to last one. Put some printk() into it to find out, it
     ends up looping forever due to goto try_again in __alloc_pages().
     Just to give it a try I've added a counter to it restricting the
     number of retries (to some arbitrary number - 5 in may case).
     If this is reached I continue to the code following the goto.
     result: no "deadlocks" anymore! I was even able to run the
     initscripts and make bzImage. However, from time to time some
     processes were killed due to lack of memory. sysctl/overcommit_memory
     was 0 and there was plenty of free swapspace.
     Finally I followed Ingo' suggestion to change __GFP_IO to __GFP_WAIT
     in refill_inactive(). With this there was no process killed anymore!
     I was able to complete make bzImage without anything going wrong.
     Furthermore it was possible to start X and login to KDE - although
     the system performance was far from being useable there was no
     problem (besides disk activity). The box run at av. load 2 for
     several hours doing almost nothing but page_in/out. My try_again
     escape was hit quit often (several 1000 times) but the fallback to
     the critical case seems to work. As I printk()'ed the value of
     memory_pressure in this case I can tell the box was running at
     memory_pressure of 30000-40000 for more than 5 hours with peaks
     beyond 50000 when starting X/KDE e.g. - just in case these numbers
     tell you something.
Taken together, the described fix seems to do the job on my system. The
patch vs. vanilla 2.4.0-t9p6 is included below. I would not claim it
to be "Right" or even more than a hack to find out what's going wrong.
Just want to give you some feedback.
PS: vmfixes-2.4.0-test9-B2 not yet tested - will do later.
Regards
Martin
