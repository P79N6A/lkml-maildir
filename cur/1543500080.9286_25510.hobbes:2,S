yes, if i understand you corrently then maybe you have missed this detail,
the new page cache does something like this as well: we store all
logical->on_disk_physical file data mappings in the page cache, this means
that if we revisit a file then we do not have to go into the lowlevel
filesystem code anymore like previous kernels. Relevant filesystem
metadata can even be freed 'under' the inode (this will eventually happen
if memory pressure increases), still file contents will be cached, the
file can be read and written, and asynchron 'store to disk' IO will still
happen, completely parallel, and without involving _any_ filesystem
metadata at all.
filesystems actively have to take advantage of this functionality, but
it's rather straightforward and the caching is automatic.

nice to hear this. Please keep us updated.
