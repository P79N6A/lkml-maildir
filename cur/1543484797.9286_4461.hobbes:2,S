I just discovered the bug yesterday evening (but I had not the time to fix
it).
The bug is that do_tty_hanghup() does a lock_kernel() in a tq_scheduler
with a current->lock_depth > -1. So lock_kernel() does nothing there and
so do_tty_hangup() was racing with the process that run the schedule() 
with the kernel lock just held.
I am going to fix now...
