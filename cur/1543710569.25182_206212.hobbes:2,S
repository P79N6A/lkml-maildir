I can't see it from user space. Its in the kernel headers. The thing is
I am working on fixes to laptop mode. The problem is it requires
changing bdflush and journaled file systems journal flush times. The
problem is that some of these (bdflush, xfs) expect the value in jiffies
and not seconds or milliseconds so making the initiation script portable
requires knowing the value of HZ.
