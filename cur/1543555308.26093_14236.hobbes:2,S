I never believe it intentional.  If it is true, the current kernel
will be suffered from a kind of DOS attack.  Yes, actually I'm a
victim of it.
By Running ZD's ServerBench, not only the performance down, but my
machine blocks all commands execution including /bin/ps, /bin/ls... ,
and those are not ^C able unless the benchmark is stopped. Those
commands are read from disks but the requests are wating at the end of
I/O queue, those won't be executed.
Anyway, I'll try your patch.
