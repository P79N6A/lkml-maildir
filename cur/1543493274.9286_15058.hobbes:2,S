I've been cleaning up my patches for generically handling dirty data in the page
cache, in preparation for 2.3.
I have noticed that someone has mangled generic_file_write.
By:
A) setting/clearing PG_lock when IO is not happening to a page.
B) Not reading in a whole page (if necessary) before it writes a partial page.
C) Not setting PG_uptodate after the data has been put in the page cache.
This confuses, but doesn't break things in the 2.2.5 right now, and for 2.3
is absolutely ridiculous.  
I am currenlty looking for why the code was changed to function this way,
so I don't damage smbfs, and nfs too much as I correct this.
