You just hit a topic I've been wanting to broach. And I'll bring it up
here, since I'm going to -try- and keep it related to the kernel. ;-)
Alan: as a Red Hat man-about-town and one of the primary kernel hackers...
a) what's your reaction to the concept of a device filesystem (not your
   reaction to the discussion; I'm a long-time devfs proponent, and I'm
   queasy just thinking about what lows this conversation has gotten to),
   and...
b) would Red Hat, as a distribution vendor, find value in an /dev that
   auto-configured itself based on available drivers? (kudzu companion,
   or at least a kudzu simplification?)
Any other distribution vendors/spokespeople, please voice your opinion,
since devfs is a feature that would seem to be targetted right at the
end-user, not the average kernel junkie. ;-)
