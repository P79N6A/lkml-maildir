 as did with the 2.5 development tree.)

So, in addition to the patches from 
http://00f.net/blogs/index.php/2004/09/07/nvidia_kernel_module_and_linux_2_6_9_mm
 
  I've changed NV_REMAP_PAGE_RANGE to NV_REMAP_PFN_RANGE and 
remap_page_range to remap_pfn_range in nv-linux.h, nv.c, os-agp.c, and 
os-interface.c, the missing piece -- see below. I may get around to 
posting patches to the nvidia forum later today.
I'm not sure if I can divulge the name of my helper in case he gets 
showered by unwanted email, but a suggested additional change to 
nv-linux.h has fixed it.
#define NV_REMAP_PFN_RANGE(from, offset, x...) \
      remap_pfn_range(vma, from, ((offset)) >> PAGE_SHIFT), x)
Regards
Sid.
