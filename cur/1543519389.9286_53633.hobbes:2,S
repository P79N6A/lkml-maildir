Look out when you're condescending.
Commodity hardware is where it is at when it comes to 3D. Forget about CAD
work etc - 3D is all about games, and probably always will be. It's just a
fact that the game market is about a million times larger than the
traditional 3D market ever was, and as a result they have more resources.
It's the i386 all over again. The "non-professional" 3D solutions are
already getting level with the "professional" ones.
How much do you wan to be that SGIis already talking to 3dlabs or Nvidia?
