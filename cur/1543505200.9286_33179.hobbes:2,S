I am getting similar error but "In swapper task - not syncing"! 
Basically this is reproducable and always happens when I write to tape
(AH 1542C).
	Detected scsi disk sdc at scsi0, channel 0, id 2, lun 0
	  Vendor: HP        Model: C1533A            Rev: AN04
	  Type:   Sequential-Access                  ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Since I am using the standard RH 6.0 kernel and 486 board makes mee
think might be kernel related.
