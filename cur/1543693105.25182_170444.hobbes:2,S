It jumped to nirvana, probably because someone passed crap 
to pci_announce_device.
My first guess would be a non matching module.  Do a make distclean
and recompile/reinstall everything.

But the decode is useless because the module in question is not loaded.
Can you load the module whatever it is manually and then decode
the oops while it's still loaded? Or better compile in all USB
statically and see if it oopses too.
Your legacy USB problems are very likely BIOS bugs.
