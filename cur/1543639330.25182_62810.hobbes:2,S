Sure. Linux is 11 years old now. Also remember that that
was the _hard_ limit. We had a soft limit near 1000,
with a kernel recompile needed to increase it. Almost
everybody was satisfied with this.
Personally I'd change my adjustable PID limit to 999,
but I wouldn't suggest that as a default. 9999 should
cover almost all systems.
Self-adjusting could be nice. Then everybody starts
with 9, and gains a digit whenever space is 50% full.
