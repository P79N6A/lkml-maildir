Hello All,
It looks like there is a small race bug in writeback_inodes()
Have a look at this 2 call chains:
writeback_inodes()
{
	....
	sb->s_count++;
	spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
	....
	spin_lock(&sb_lock);
	if (__put_super(sb))		<<< X
		goto restart;
	}
}
deactivate_super()
{
	fs->kill_sb(s);
		kill_block_super(sb)
			generic_shutdown_super(sb)
			        spin_lock(&sb_lock);
			        list_del(&sb->s_list);	<<< Y
			        spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
	....
	put_super(s);
	        spin_lock(&sb_lock);
	        __put_super(sb);			<<< Z
         	spin_unlock(&sb_lock);
}
The problem with it is that writeback_inodes() supposes that if 
__put_super() returns 0 then no super block was deleted from the list 
and we can safely traverse sb list further.
But as it is obvious from the deactivate_super() it's not actually true. 
because at point Y we delete super block from the list and drop the 
lock. We do __put_super() very much later... So we can find sb with 
poisoned sb->s_list at point X and we won't be the last sb reference 
holders. The last reference will be dropped in point Z.
So in case of the following sequence of execution Y -> X -> Z we'll get 
an oops after point X in writeback_inodes().
Am I correct with it?
Kirill
