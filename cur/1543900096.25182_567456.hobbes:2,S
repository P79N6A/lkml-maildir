Thanks, I wish smp_call_function_single() could be left alone as well,
different semantics of the two would be ugly and only breed confusion.

Ok, so what we (presently) have is:
1. smp_call_function() -> run given function on all *other* CPUs
2. on_each_cpu() -> run given function on _all_ CPUs
This is perfectly fine, and serves all possible use cases.
And I think what's proposed is:
1. Change smp_call_function() semantics, to run given function
on _all_ CPUs (thus getting rid of the on_each_cpu() "mistake")
2. Resort to (most probably implement another function?) using
smp_call_function_mask() or flags appropriately to also serve
the use cases where we need to run a given function on all
_other_ CPUs
Does this pointless/gratuitous code-churn really make sense?
Definitely not to me ...
[ For the _single() case we now have on_cpu() as you originally
proposed, which I definitely like and fills the other gap in the API. ]
So I still don't quite understand what is the need to change existing
semantics of smp_call_function{_single} in the first place.

We already have on_each_cpu() for precisely such usage. I don't see
what / why would someone be open-coding ...

But for a different reason. You've confused existing and the
proposed/new semantics of smp_call_function_single() here.
* Existing semantics:
Why is disabling preemption *compulsory* for correctness with
existing smp_call_function_single semantics?
Because we want to _detect_ (and WARN() + return error) for cases
when the _caller_ failed to disable preemption => by the time we
execute smp_call_function_single, we (current thread) could
actually have gone over to the target CPU (which is illegal with
existing semantics), so we need to check for that and warn.
Now, note that disabling preemption in smp_call_function{_single}
themselves is *insufficient*. We could be running on the target
CPU _already_ by the time we disable preemption inside those
functions. We'd end up finding this, WARN'ing about it, returning
an error -- all that could've been avoided if only the _caller_ had
the good sense to disable preemption _before_ calling smp_...()
So the *only* sane way (with existing semantics) to call the
smp_...() functions is to do that with preemption disabled in
the _caller_.
* Proposed semantics:
Here, we just don't care about what CPU we are on when we're
executing smp_call_function_single() -- if we're on the target
CPU, we'll just execute the function locally (in current thread
itself) else we'll fire off the IPI to get it executed on the target
CPU.
Of course, to make the decision above, we would need to have
a "if (current_cpu == target_cpu)" kind of check, and there's no
safe way to obtain "current_cpu" without disabling preemption --
so *that* is why the proposed code did the get_cpu() /
preemption-disabling inside smp_call_function_single().

As I said, that's because the caller wouldn't _care_ with the new
semantics.
Anyway, I don't really care enough about this (I'm not writing any code
that could get directly affected by all this) to continue objecting to the
proposed change. All I'm pointing out is just that it's unnecessary, and
I suspect nobody likes code churn just for the sake of it.
