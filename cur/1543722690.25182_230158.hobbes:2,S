As I understand it, if you feed serial core a given major, minor, and
device name, it rejects you if there is already a driver using them.
I certainly had failed registrations when I tried to "share" ttyS0.
If my understanding is not correct, I'd be happy to try something else to
see if it would work for us.
The old driver didn't use serial core, so I think it was able to get away
with it.
If the current distributions worked better with a console port using
dynamic minors, I would have no problem using them.  But at this point, if
we tried to use them, we'd just break until /dev was populated with our
device node - missing startup messages and such.
