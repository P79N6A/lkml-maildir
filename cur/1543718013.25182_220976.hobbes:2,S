Right...
One possible suspect might be open(O_EXCL) since, AFAICS, Andreas is
using maildir-style mailboxes. Perhaps that SETATTR call in
nfs3_proc_create() is failing? We recently fixed so that it always sets
MTIME/ATIME...
Andreas: when you do the "strace" could you first run
echo "16" >/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug
and then record the output from "dmesg" immediately after the kmail
crash?
Cheers,
