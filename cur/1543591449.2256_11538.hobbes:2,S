So I stuck my justify this change to Ted hat on. And failed. 
For one the cleanest way to handle all the locking is to propogate the other
locking fix styles into both the ldisc and serial drivers. At least for 2.4
until the 2.5 folks get their deep magic inactivity based clean up working
The advantage of doing that is that modules that do play with use counts will
not do anything worse than they do now, and will remain fully compatible.
The ldisc race is also real and completely unfixed right now.
