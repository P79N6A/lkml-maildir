Hi,
I have a problem with one of my routers not configuring eth0 after a reboot
since I've switched to Linux 2.2.2-ac7 (from 2.0.36).
Debugging the network config scripts showed that it was this problem:
+ ifconfig eth0 130.161.38.165 netmask 255.255.240.0 broadcast 130.161.47.255
SIOCSIFFLAGS: Resource temporarily unavailable
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
My "solution" is to do *exactly the same* ifconfig command after the first
one fails.  Then it succeeds.  Sometimes the first one *is* successful.
I have another router with the same setup that does not have this problem.
So it seems that there is some kind of timing problem that makes
the SIOCSIFFLAGS control fail temporarily.
Is this a known problem ?
My setup:
---------
	- standard Red Hat 5.2 (completely up-to-date, with all 2.2 updates
	  from Red Hat)
	- Cyrix DX2 66, 16 MB RAM
	- 3c503 Ethernet card
	- 2 PPP lines (but the problem shows *before* PPP is started !)
	- 2.2.2-ac7 kernel built with gcc-2.7.2.3 (on RH 5.2, 2.2.2-ac7)
	- all drivers built into the kernel: no modules or kerneld
	- system has always functioned flawlessly with Linux 2.0.x
Red Hat details:
----------------
I have added an extra "./ifup eth0 boot" to /etc/rc.d/init.d/network in
the "start)" section just before the "touch /var/lock/subsys/network"
This results in exactly the same ifconfig command as the one that
just failed.
	Greetings,
