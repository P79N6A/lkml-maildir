Doesn't that sound even more like the music industry ? Pick on Grandma,
and people who've no clue about the issue. It's not the way to solve such
problems. The world does not need "The war on binary modules". Educate
people instead, and talk to vendors.
Save the atomic weapons for the people who are straight forward ripping
off work in routers, tvs and all sorts of appliances.
