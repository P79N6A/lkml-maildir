Sorry, "accessible to all filesystems" is incorrect terminology (it's
backwards).  What I meant was something more like "able to access
extended data from all filesystems".  But I think everyone understands
what I meant.

Well, we could still have a flamewar about whether metafs is useful,
what type of functionality it should provide, etc.  I'm sure we could
find something to argue about. ;-)
From a purely philosophical/aesthetic/theoretical point of view, I like
file-as-dir much better than anything else, and would be ecstatic it if
Namesys was able to make it work.  From a practical/technical point of
view, metafs may be an acceptable compromise.
