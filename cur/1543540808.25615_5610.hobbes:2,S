Hi guys,
It is very late and so the report is vague but simple.
a) Boot 2.4.0-test6-pre2.
b) take a DDS-2 tape with 4G of stuff tar'ed onto it
c) start untarring the tape into ext2 filesystem. The drive is Seagate
DDS2 Model: Python 04687-XXX  Rev: 6610.
d) it will lockup. Alt-Sysrq works and shows lots of interesting stuff
(e.g. looping EIP but I was so busy that I didn't note this info down -
maybe tomorrow will retry the experiment)
repeat the same procedure (after reboot and fsck) - it will lockup exactly
in the same place where it did before. Do it again - it will lockup in the
same place again.
Now, (THANKS to AlanCox18 kernel!) I was able to recover (it was actually
untarring my rootfs by booting into altroot) my machine by rebooting into
2.4.0-test1-ac18 kernel.
Regards,
Tigran
