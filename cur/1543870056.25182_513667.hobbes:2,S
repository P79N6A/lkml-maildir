Hi Jens,
	I read through the lguest thread and came up with the patch
below, I hope I understood correctly.  We still need to do the check to
make sure we ask for at least one sector to be processed in
end_that_request_first(), as the request that triggers the lockup here
(an sg_io ioctl in this case), has both req->hard_nr_sectors and
req->hard_cur_sectors = 0.

Fix soft lockup with iSeries viocd driver, caused by eventually calling
end_that_request_first() with nr_bytes 0.
The lockup is triggered by hald, interrogating the device.
