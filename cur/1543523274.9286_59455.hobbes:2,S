Indeed, you're completely right. This is a bug in the kernel
that explains some strange results I've even been able to see
on my dual P120...

*nod*  The constant used is erroneous too :)

I think we should fix this immediately. Ingo, what do you
say? (Ingo wrote the original code, maybe he had some things
in mind with it that we can't see by just looking at it)
I've done the calculation by hand and, assuming 150MB/sec
(which is very optimistic for my machine), I arrive at a
cacheflush_time of 5.3msec, instead of the 0.3usec (whatever,
I'm testing 2.2 now) the kernel used before.
This >1000 fold difference might well explain the strange
variances in CPU usage I've seen in programs like xmms :)

This may be a good point too. It might be worthwhile to
schedule the processes with a short timeslice in bunches
and in such a way that they don't interfere as much with
the longer timesliced processes.
I don't know if this would be worth it though...

Definately. Maybe we want to calculate PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY
and/or the TLB_FLUSH weight on boottime?  We don't have to
worry much about the extra cache access that will give because
we'll either have a small runqueue or we'll use those two
values over and over again :)
