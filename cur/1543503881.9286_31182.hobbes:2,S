Hi guys!
Perhaps changes in the /proc format could be handled by the following
scheme: the kernel carries some sort of a script (configuration file)
which defines the fields in the /proc and the way they are output.  The
scripting language should also include the ability of specifying
calculations so that things like ratio of two fields are possible.  Procps
utils would just serve as an interpreter of this script.
Just an idea.
