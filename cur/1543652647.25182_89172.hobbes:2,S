With 2.5.47-bk-current, your patch is apparently included.
I had to modify this Makefile (in 2.5.47-bk) to include suspend.o 
unconditionally because of saved_* is declared here, and they are 
needed by ACPI. Of course, it is also possible to do
obj-$(CONFIG_ACPI_SLEEP) += acpi_wakeup.o suspend.o
instead of linking suspend.o unconditionally, but I did not tested it.
                                    Best regards,
                                        Petr Vandrovec
