The point is that you *don't* want those modules to be loaded. What you 
want is for the kernel to know that those modules are available, and 
therefore mention that drivers could be found for those devices, and 
therefore udev would create the device nodes for them, even though the 
kernel doesn't contain a module that drives them yet.
If something actually opens the device node, the module will be loaded, 
but until then it isn't using up resources.
