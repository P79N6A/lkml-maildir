I will add that this is also a performance optimization, as it was
initially discovered by Vasily because he saw bounces issues with
blktrace. The blktrace notify was done early when we iterated the bio
segments to check for bounces, no bounces were actually issued (this
problem was fixed for 2.6.20 by moving the notify in mm/bounce.c to when
we actually bounce). So it does cause needless bio segment iterations on
some setups, because of this one-off.
