:^) I use experimental options too, but for instance experimental
filesystems isn't something I'd use on machine where work other than
development is performed, and experimental net-support might be cool, but
not on web-servers, etc...
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL makes all the DANGEROUS options available as
it stands now. My change removes that.
This gives an opportunity to make it clearer what things are experimental
in a "safe" way (ok, you might hang your computer and lose a file or two,
but you'll have most of your disk intact), and what's really mean.
In my opinion, there are quite a lot of drivers that could lose that
EXPERIMENTAL-flag without too much trouble; many drivers that are flagged
such are more stable than some of those not flagged as such....

As an option, or why we shouldn't use such drivers?
