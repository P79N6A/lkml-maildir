Do they ? Even if the data is static, it can become invalid
(in the sense that accessing it from a callback would lead
to some kind of undesirable behaviour, even though the access
itself would work), so I don't quite see why the difference
would matter.
Example:
	static ... common_callback(...)
	{
		switch (my_state) {
			...
		}
	}
	...
	my_state = A;
	register_fancy_timer_A(&me_A,common_callback);
	...
	unregister_fancy_timer_A(&me_A);
	my_state = B;
	/* stray fancy_timer_A call to common_callback would
	   trigger action for state B */
	...
	register_fancy_timer_B(&me_B,common_callback);
	...
Depending on "my_state", the callback would perform different
actions. (The "fancy timers" would be some timer-like service
that doesn't del_timer_sync.)
This is getting to abstract. Why don't you just say where you
see the difference ? :-)
