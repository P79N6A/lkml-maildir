The other way around, you mean: we spin until the owner is no longer 
holding a cpu.
I agree that it's better than the normal "spin for some random time" 
model, but I can't say I like the "return 0" cases where it just retries 
the whole loop if the semaphore was gotten by somebody else instead. 
Sounds like an easyish live-lock to me. 
I also still strongly suspect that whatever lock actually needs this, 
should be seriously re-thought. 
But apart from the "return 0" craziness I at least dont' _hate_ this 
patch. Do we have numbers? Do we know which locks this matters on?
