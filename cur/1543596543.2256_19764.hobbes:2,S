I missed your original post. If you want some form or generic tracing in
the kernel then DProbes with LTT might help.
With these tools you can build tracepoints without modifying the source.
You could use system.map to generate simple tracepoint definitions (having
written yourself a small program to parse the map output).

Yes I think, that would be a great alternative, using good old /proc.
