It would be much better if it would break all the time. Then bisecting
would not be guesswork. :-P

Added to my current "2.6.23-rc4-mm0.5"
I will report it's output.
> Also, does 'dmesg -s 10000000' give full dmesg?
That boot ended in a minimal initrd environment that normally only
starts the RAID5 and then opens contained encrypted real root.
I was just able to push the output from dmesg through the serial link,
but had no man pages to tell me about -s ...
And that kind of error was until now a one-of-a-kind one. All other
errors where not "internal error" but "timeout".
But one time I had another SGT related error:
Sep 11 19:19:24 treogen [   33.340000] ata1.00: exception Emask 0x20
SAct 0x1 SErr 0x0 action 0x2

PCI master abort while fetching SGT

50/00:00:af:ea:42/00:00:25:00:00/e0 Emask 0x20 (host bus error)
What I find kind of interessing is, that while I got three different
error codes the cmd part of the output was always the same.

It's not just 2.6.23-rc4-mm1. All -mm's after rc4 are broken for me.
Confirmed breakage on -rc4-mm1, -rc6-mm1 and -rc8-mm1. I'm just
narrowing on rc4-mm1 because that was the first version to break.
I'm currently trying to bisect 2.6.23-rc4-mm1. Here is the current status:
[the 2.6.23-rc4-mm1 series-file has 2013 lines]
Up to (incl.) x86_64-convert-to-clockevents.patch (line 747): 2 good boots
Up to (incl.) x86_64-cleanup-struct-irqaction-initializers-patch
(line779): 2 good boots
Up to (incl.) slub-optimize-cacheline-use-for-zeroing.patch (line
1045): 1 failed
Up to (incl.) fix-discrepancy-between-vdso-based... (line1461): 1 good, 1 failed
Next try: up to patch fs-remove-some-aop_truncated_page.patch
That means from the patches added to the rc4 variant of the mm-kernel
the following are remaining:
git-xfs-build-fix.patch
enforce-noreplace-smp-in-alternative_instructions.patch
paravirt-fix-preemptible-lazy-mode-bug.patch
i386-apic-fix-4-bit-apicid-assumption-of-mach-default.patch
fix-the-max-path-calculation-in-radix-treec-update.patch
mm-no-need-to-cast-vmalloc-return-value-in-zone_wait_table_init.patch
introduce-write_begin-write_end-aops-fix2.patch
implement-simple-fs-aops-fix.patch

slub-place-kmem_cache_cpu-structures-in-a-numa-aware-way.patch
slub-optimize-cacheline-use-for-zeroing.patch
But due to the unreliable nature of the bug, I can't be to sure about that.
Next version is compiled, now again switching the PC off for an hour...
