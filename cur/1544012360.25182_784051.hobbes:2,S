These two questions are not specific to git; whatever
answers apply to sha1 also apply here.  Sha1 will always be
strong enough to detect any combination of random errors.
As for deliberate attacks, it is considered strong enough to
resist all but the most computationally intensive attacks
(the kind that require a worldwide effort or maybe NSA type
facilities).

"git fsck --full" will do it of course, but I'm not sure
what other operations also start off or end up doing a
check.
