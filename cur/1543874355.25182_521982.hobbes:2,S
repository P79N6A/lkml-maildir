OK.  I think.  It's hard to tell.  I assume that the acquire_console_sem()
in here is to synchronise against some other function which also takes
acquire_console_sem(), but it is not clear which.
So could you please redo this with a comment which tells the reader exactly
what's being protected against what, and why?
Also, I always feel a bit worried by:
	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
	down(...);
because if it hits contention, the down() will undo the
set_curremt_state().  Now that's normally OK because we loop, and because
the semaphore won't normally be 100% contended all the time.  Unless
someone reimplements down() so it happens to return in state TASK_RUNNING
all the time, which they could legitimately do (although this would
probably break stuff such as the above).
But still, it is nicer to do
	down(...);
	set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
if possible, and I think it is possible here.
Thanks.
