On an VIA EPIA board, I got this single oops at boot. Wasn't stored on
file so I had to take a screenshot with a digital camera. Basicallly
goes along those lines:
Process: S36mountvirtfs
Call trace:
     run_timer_softirq+0x16f/0x200
     __do_softirq
     do_softirq
     irq_exit
     do_IRQ
     common_interrupt
Process is found here on my system:
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root root 21 Mar  1 00:29 /etc/rcS.d/S36mountvirtfs ->
../init.d/mountvirtfs
The exact screenshot (500k) can be found here:

I can spend time copying the input into a file and doing the ksymoops
stuff if someone wants to get it.
Otherwise I will go back to try fixing the other problems that happens
much more often...
