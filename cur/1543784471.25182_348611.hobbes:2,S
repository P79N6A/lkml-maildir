I didn't see the patch from Ivan Kokshaysky ( 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112541348008047&w=2 ) 
included.. Without this one my laptop will freeze and die when inserting 
a something into the cardbus slot, so I would say that it would kind of 
fit in there.
Any reason why it's not included?
