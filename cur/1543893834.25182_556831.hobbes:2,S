Ah, so here comes the documentation :-) Actually, I've seen a lot
of patchsets these days that prefer to submit the documentation
patch in the beginning, so that a reader / reviewer can get ready
about what to expect from the code.
Anyway, I really liked your submission. It makes netconsole
quite flexible and powerful, indeed.
Thanks,
Satyam
