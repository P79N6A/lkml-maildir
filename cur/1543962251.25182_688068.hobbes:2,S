Not sure whether #error on gcc 4.1.{0.1} is the right thing as I found atleast
one distro gcc which says itself as 4.1.1, do not exhibit the problem as it
most likely has fix backported.
Putting all weak functions in one file is something Suresh and I considered
before sending this patch. But, looking at various users of __weak, that
single file did not look very appropriate.
