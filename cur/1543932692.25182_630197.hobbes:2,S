I can't quite parse the last sentence above.  Is it:
The ktype controls (a) what happens ...
and (b) the kobject's default representation in sysfs.

This is (still) confusing to me.  Is it:
                                   a pointer "kp" to a ...
or is struct uio_mem the "kp"?

Is kobject_set_name() marked as __deprecated ?
