(This report is on behalf of Declan Moriarty)
To reproduce the problem, install the "kbd" package, and from the first
virtual console execute the following command:
setfont lat1-08          # or any other 8-pixel font
Then switch to the second console and see that the cursor disappeared.
Moreover, the following escape sequences function improperly:
echo -e '\033[?Xc' where X is a digit
Even more, from the second console this command
setfont lat1-16
gives 43 screen lines with only upper halves of characters (bottoms are cut,
and I suspect this also happens with the cursor).
Looks like a bug in the character cell height logic. Could you please fix it
or at least point me to some overview of the relevant source files?
