Subject: repeatable SMP lockups - kernel 2.4.9

Our new SMP file- and printserver locks always hard up, if higher load
come on the NIC. True stable without networking (X11, DRI
1. First, I have changed the NIC from 3Com (vortex-driver) to noname,
driven by Realtek
RTL-8139 (rev 10) and the lockup occurs some later, but it occurs
repeatable if I copy large file on LAN, or export an X11 environment to
another box.
2. Changing the kernel to 2.2.19 results the same thing.
Donald Becker wrote, that he think, this apparently could be a bug with
the interrupt handling in the 2.4.9 kernel, not inside
the (his) driver itself.
The boot on the mainboard (Asus CUV266-D, 2x PIII 1 GHz, 512 mb DDR-RAM)
is always o.k. with APIC, excepting the 'unexpected IO-APIC, please mail'
- warning.
The lockup occurs too with 'noapic' on boot.
At third stage I can try another and 'smp-cleaner' (I think)  NIC, D-Link
DFE-500 TX, based on DEC-Chip, using the tulip-driver.
Nothing is wrote about this in /var/log messages. The box is SCSI only,
Adaptec 29160N.
/proc/interrupts:

Looks clean :-(
Are there any patches, hints or recommendations known about this?
