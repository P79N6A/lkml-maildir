    So before we design filesystems that support multi-forks, let's
    please think about how they will be used, and how they will
    interact with current systems that don't really support multiple
    forks, and in fact are quite hostile to the whole concept.  What's
isn't this one of those perpetual internet wheel of time discussions?
in any case, i'm with you here. all of the unix-based appleshare
servers that use posixy filesystems that i'm aware of use a
.AppleDouble/.resource/.whatever. interface to the filesystem. of
course this makes splitting forks a problem if you're not careful, but
that's always going to be the case unless you stay on a filesystem
that has a concept of forks to begin with. apple, of course, chose the
latter course by using the non-posixy parts of hfsplus.
having said that, i actually think that keeping associated bits
bundled together would be a good idea in a number of cases. i'm
particularly interested in appleshare (although i'll be solving those
issues by going the database route), but i think being able to give
the filesystem hints on what to keep together would be a good idea in
general. however, i would much rather have something like an hfs-style
interface to that bundling. that way, we can specify things like
"mount -o afpd" and get the .AppleDouble layout that i want or "mount
-o bundle" and have .bundle directories everywhere. so, for
AppleDouble style forks, we get the following:
	    d/file
	    d/.AppleDouble
	    d/.AppleDouble/.Parent
	    d/.AppleDouble/file
for something that wants to handle arbitrary forks, we can have the
following: 
	    d/file
	    d/.bundle
	    d/.bundle/.Parent/fork1
	    d/.bundle/.Parent/fork2
	    d/.bundle/file/a
	    d/.bundle/file/b
	    d/.bundle/file/c
if you want to bundle some info together, you just create something in
the special dot directory. that way, something like reiserfs will get
auto-tuned for any filesystem usage that's desired, all the standard
unix commands still work, files are transferrable to non-fork
understanding filesystems, and your program can work without
modification on less hintable filesystems.
