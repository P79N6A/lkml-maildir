I want to disable the cacheable feature, or limit the maximum of memory sizes which could be used for cached data. But anyone know how I shall do in the kernel? I use 2.4.20 kernel. Thanks.
It doesn't work that way. If memory is needed for something else, the 
amount of memory used for cache will be reduced.
