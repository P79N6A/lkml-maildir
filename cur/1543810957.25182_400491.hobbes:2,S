I did think about moving stuff to "mio" and pass it around. Then, I
realized I need to think hard about mpage_writepages() also to come
out with a super-set "mio". For now, I settled with arguments for now,
when we cleanup mpage_writepages() we can take a pass at cleaning up
mpage_readpages() also.  (BTW, there are only 2 more arguments added).
Thanks,
