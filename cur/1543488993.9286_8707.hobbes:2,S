Hi.  I'm upgrading from 2.0.36 RH 5.2 to the 2.2.2 kernel.  I think I am
doing everything right when compiling the kernel, but when I get to "make
dep" I get the following errors:
[root@melroseplace linux]# make dep
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o scripts/mkdep
scripts/mkdep.c
scripts/mkdep.c:13: ctype.h: No such file or directory
scripts/mkdep.c:14: stdio.h: No such file or directory
scripts/mkdep.c:15: stdlib.h: No such file or directory
scripts/mkdep.c:16: string.h: No such file or directory
scripts/mkdep.c:17: unistd.h: No such file or directory
scripts/mkdep.c:19: sys/fcntl.h: No such file or directory
scripts/mkdep.c:20: sys/mman.h: No such file or directory
scripts/mkdep.c:21: sys/stat.h: No such file or directory
scripts/mkdep.c:22: sys/types.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [scripts/mkdep] Error 1
Is it possible there are files missing?  When I try make xconfig or make
menuconfig instead of make config, I get similar errors:
[root@melroseplace linux]# make menuconfig
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o

Please help if you recognize any of this.  Thanks!!
