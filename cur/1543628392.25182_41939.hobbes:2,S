Umh, but those optimizations are interesting only if they're
cumulative, i.e., once you've got 10 of them and they make a *total*
difference of 5% (actually, I'm doubtful anyone really notices
differences of 20-30% other than for benchmarking purposes... ;-).
For me, 1% is the magic threshold.  If we find real apps that get a
higher penalty than that, I'd either lower the HZ or see if we can
tune the timer tick to be within a safe margin.
No matter what, though, higher tick rate clearly incurs somewhat
higher overhead.  The benefit is lower application-level response time
and finer-granularity timeouts.  I assume Robert has all the
benchmarks to show that. ;-)
