Hi All!
it seems that the build system now does not allow
to disable the VGA Console anymore :(
removing 
  CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
or replacing with 
  # CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE is not set
gets automatically changed back to 
  CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
on make?
system is x86, but what if I do not have a vga console at all?
best,
Herbert
