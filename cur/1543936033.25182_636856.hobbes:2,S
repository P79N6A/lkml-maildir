your real issue is that your userspace app is hogging the CPU. While network is
not really cpu intensive, it does require that ample time at many intervals is
given to the CPU to run cleanups and prevent FIFO issues.
alternatively, you can increase your rx/tx ring descriptor count (with ethtool),
which basically makes it easier for the hardware not to be serviced for a longer
period, since there are more buffers available and the card can go longer on when
userspace is hogging the CPU.

correct, it might not.

irqbalance is a simple userspace app that drops into any system seemlessly and
does the best job all around - often it beats manual tuning of smp_affinity even ;)
