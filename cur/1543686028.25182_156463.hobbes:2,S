Ext2/3 uses feature flags instead of version numbers to indicate such
changes.  Version numbers are a poor way of indicating whether a change
is compatible or not compared to feature flags.  For example, if you bump
the minor number to indicate a "compatible" change it means that any
code that pretends to support version x.y features also needs to support
all features <= y and all features <= x.
If you really want to have a feature number to be happy, just think of
	s.feature_incompat.s_feature_ro_compat.s_feature_compat
as something like a version number and you will nearly be happy.
Cheers, Andreas
