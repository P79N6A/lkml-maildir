I've been tracking down my booting problem, and while reviewing old
email, found that in trying to track down (and never succeeding) a VM
problem last fall, I determined that any kernel after 2.4.15-pre2
would not boot on my machine.  So, something changed between
2.4.15-pre2 and 2.4.15-pre3 that means linux will not boot.  The
symptom is that the boot sequence displays "Loading linux-2.4.19..."
but never display "Uncompressing".  I've enclosed the 2.4.15-pre3
Changelog.  Any ideas which of the changes would have affected
booting?
pre3:
 - Al Viro: sanity-check user arguments, zero-terminated strings etc.
 - Urban Widmark: smbfs update (server/client cache coherency etc)
 - Rik van Riel, Marcelo Tosatti: VM updates
 - Cort Dougan: PPC updates
 - Neil Brown: raid1/5 failed drive fixups, NULL ptr checking, md error cleanup
 - Neil Brown: knfsd fix for 64-bit architectures, and filehandle resolveir
 - Ken Brownfield: workaround for menuconfig CPU selection glitch
 - David Miller: sparc64 MM setup fix, arpfilter forward port
 - Keith Owens: Remove obsolete IPv6 provider based addressing
 - Jari Ruusu: block_write error case cleanup fix
 - Jeff Garzik: netdriver update
Thanks!
Dan.
