i want to develop frame relay stack for linux. what is the procedure if i 
want to add this effort to the standard linux code and future versions.
this would be different from the rfc1490 that is currently implemented in 
linux. i would like to develop fr on linux - pvc and svc implementing Q.922 
core and Q.933 for signalling.
