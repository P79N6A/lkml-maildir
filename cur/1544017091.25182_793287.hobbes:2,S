Here are some more performance numbers with "slub_test" kernel module.
It's basically a really tiny microbenchmark, so I don't really consider
it gives too useful results, except it does show up some problems in
SLAB's scalability  that may start to bite as we continue to get more
threads per socket.
(I ran a few of these tests on one of Dave's 2 socket, 128 thread
systems, and slab gets really painful... these kinds of thread counts
may only be a couple of years away from x86).
All numbers are in CPU cycles.

We can see SLAB has a fair bit more overhead in this case. SLUB starts
doing higher order allocations I think around size 256, which reduces
costs there. Don't know what the SLQB artifact at 16 is caused by...
2. Kmalloc: alloc/free test (repeatedly allocate and free)

Here we see SLUB's allocator passthrough (or is the the lack of queueing?).
Straight line speed at small sizes is probably due to instructions in the
fastpaths. It's pretty meaningless though because it probably changes if
there is any actual load on the CPU, or another CPU architecture. Doesn't
look bad for SLQB though :)
Concurrent allocs
=================
1. Like the first single thread test, lots of allocs, then lots of frees.
But running on all CPUs. Average over all CPUs.

A problem with SLAB scalability starts showing up on this system with only
4 threads per socket. Again, SLUB sees a benefit from higher order
allocations.
2. Same as 2nd single threaded test, alloc then free, on all CPUs.

No surprises. Objects always fit in queues (or unqueues, in the case of
SLUB), so there is no cross cache traffic.
Remote free test
================
1. Allocate N objects on CPUs 1-7, then free them all from CPU 0. Average cost
   of all kmalloc+kfree

2. All CPUs allocate on objects on CPU N, then freed by CPU N+1 % NR_CPUS
   (ie. CPU1 frees objects allocated by CPU0).

SLAB's concurrent allocation bottlnecks show up again in these tests.
Unfortunately these are not too realistic tests of remote freeing pattern,
because normally you would expect remote freeing and allocation happening
concurrently, rather than all allocations up front, then all frees. If
the test behaved like that, then object could probably fit in SLAB's
queues and it might see some good numbers.
