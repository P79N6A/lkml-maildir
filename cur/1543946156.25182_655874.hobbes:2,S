Drivers know how to treat a group of descriptors as one operation.  I
see this as no different than the case where an operation exceeds the
hardware's per descriptor max transfer length.  The driver internally
creates extra descriptors but the client only needs to worry about one
handle.

Agreed, more code less words :-).  I'll try to brew this into a patch.
