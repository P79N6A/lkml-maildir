Have you seen the new pricing Samsung has announced for their 3rd
generation SSD.  It is about 1/3 of the Intel' SSD price if I recall
correctly and the performance is approaching Intel's from what I've
seen.
I've been talking to the OpenHSM (Hierachical Storage Manager) team
about their project.  They are working on getting the logic in place
now to move data blocks from one class of storage to another while
leaving the filesystem itself un-affected from the users perspective.
http://code.google.com/p/fscops/
They have a very long way to go with their code/project, but it is
conceptually similar to the ext4_defrag patch that already exists.
The big difference is the data block allocation algorithm will have to
be totally different.
If and when that get their code done, I would love to have 500 GB of
SSD teamed with several TB of rotational HDD and have the HSM move my
files between fast SSD and slow rotational.  I typically know which
datasets I will be working with heavily, so even a simple user space
tool that would let me adjust which tier of storage my files were
sitting on would suffice.
