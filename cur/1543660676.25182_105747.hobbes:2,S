This doesn't look particularly reassuring either. We have:
	(1) increment ->pre_sequence
	(2) wmb()
	(3) get inode->i_size
	(4) wmb() 
	(5) increment ->post_sequence
	(6) wmb()
Supposing the overall scheme is sound, one of the wmb()'s is unnecessary;
in theory rmb() is all that's needed before (5) to catch writes.
I'd have to go through some kind of state transition fiasco to be sure
this actually recovers from the races where two readers fetch the same
value of ->pre_sequence or ->post_sequence and store the same
incremented value to convince myself this is right. I'll assume you've
either done so yourself or are relying on someone else's verification.
Restarting the read like this is highly unusual; if retrying the
critical section is in fact the basis of this locking algorithm then
it's not a true ticket lock.

Yes, this is a standard requirement for all non-sleeping locks. There
was only enough code in the post to "be sure" that the fetch and
increment bits were missing; I assumed that otherwise they'd be wrapped.
