No we don't. Only fbmem, and that's part of the patch. What we could
do is strip the FB_ACTIVATE_FORCE (and actually clear out the
activate field completely) when copying to the driver's var structure
in fb_set_var().
In fact, we should certainly fix fb_set_var to _ignore_ the activate
field when comparing the var structures... this is a bug in the
current version imho.
It's a bit difficult to fix it while keeping memcmp, except if we do
a local copy of the var structure, which would eat stack space...
One problem with unblank is that it can be called at interrupt time,
but I don't think that ever happens with mode_switch set to true.
So we may just kmalloc a local copy of the var...
Ben.
