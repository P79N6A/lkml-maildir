you should have a look at 
http://linux.chapter7.ch/touchkit/
it contains a howto and a calibration progam. it's centered around
touchscreens with eGalax controllers but the info there is valid for
about every touchscreen as long as the driver uses the linux input
subsystem (it really should).
hope this helps. rgds
