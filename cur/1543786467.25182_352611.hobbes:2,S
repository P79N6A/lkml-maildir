Yes it seems generic. And I think the reason being that I did not have a
significant number of things to report hence could not create logical groups
and giving very specific names to those groups. As of today, based on the
requirements, could think of only two items (page size, current). There
is still scope for few more things to appear. Hence gave a generic name and
thought more items can be grouped in this note itself until and unless group
becomes really big and need to break.
Do you have any suggestion to make this name better?

Dave has already mentioned about the need of page size. I agree that page
size is a compile time information. Are you hinting at creating a separate
note for reporting page size in user space while loading the capture kernel 
and store it in reserved region alongside other elf headers. Not sure, if
it is good to create a separate note type just to report one configuration
variable. 
I also thought of enabling "Kernel .config support" (CONFIG_IKCONFIG=y) and
may be "crash" could write a script similar to scripts/extract-ikconfig to
retrieve any configuration variable required from vmlinux itself. But this
option is not enabled by default and will increase kernel image size and
seems too much to do for a single configuration variable.

It can be done but as Dave suggested but that requires significant amount 
of job to be done as one has to traverse through the active task stacks and
look for crash_kexec(). An easier/simpler way is that kernel itself can 
report it.  Netdump, diskdump already do it. I think for simplicity, it 
makes sense to export this information from kernel in the form of note.
Only issue I could think of is stack overflow and current might be 
corrupted after panic.

Sorry, I did not get this. Can you elaborate a little more on this. What
kind of debug information can be helpful in determining the current.

That's true. Probably a new note type shall be required to store
architectural control registers. May be something like NT_KDUMP_CRREG and
NT_KDUMPINFO can continue to capture miscellaneous info.
