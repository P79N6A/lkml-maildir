Some random ideas:
	- reinstall the slower, stable CPUs and burn the BIOS
		If you are a linux hacker then you kept these
		"just in case".. or else
	- get a loaner CPU and use it to burn the BIOS
		If you are a linux hacker then you have no
		life and no friends to get a loaner from but
		you do have a roomfull of computer parts...
		otherwise
	- install only one CPU, it may be more stable
	- run your CPU slower than spec, it may be more stable
		most microcode bugs are not timining sensitive
		but it is worth a try
Good luck.
