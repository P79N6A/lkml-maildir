Unfortunately I can't add anything here.

Well, the userspace suspend will not work with the 2.6.16.x kernels.
Still you can control the image size using the /sys/power/image_size
attribute (0 for the minimal image).

Yes, and the activation of the device (keybard) fails here.  It probably is a
good idea to let the respective driver maintainer know about this.

Probably the devices _are_ woken up at the proper time, but it takes time
for them to get ready and the messages they produce in the process interfere
with the swsusp's messages.  You can try to disable the USB's verbose debug
messages (if they are enabled) and see if that helps or to decrease the
console loglevel before suspend.

Works for me. :-)

But requires a newer kernel.
