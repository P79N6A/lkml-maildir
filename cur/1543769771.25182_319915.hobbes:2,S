Subject: Dangerous libata Data Corruption Bug (2.4 & 2.6)

I've been setting up software RAID5/6 file servers for the past few month, and I
came accross a data corruption bug using the libata driver : It's not an easy
one to find as I need to copy and copy over data to finally have an error
(usually betwen 150GB to 2TB).
So far, every server using the libata driver I've setup has this bug
Here's the awful script I've been using to find this bug :
"
#!/bin/sh
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/dummy01 bs=1M count=5120
md5sum /tmp/dummy01 > /tmp/dummy.md5
cd /tmp
while [ 1 = 1 ]
    do
        cp /tmp/dummy01 /tmp/dummy02
        rm /tmp/dummy01
        cp /tmp/dummy02 /tmp/dummy01
        md5sum -cv /tmp/dummy.md5
        echo "1" >> /tmp/mdc
        rm /tmp/dummy02
        echo "Tested over: `cat /tmp/mdc | wc -l`0 GB"
    done
"
