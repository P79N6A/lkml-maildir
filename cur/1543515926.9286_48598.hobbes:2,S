The low level raw code should know about address mappings *at all* in
the first place.  
The whole reason for adding kiobufs was to remove all traces of VM
knowledge from the driver-specific IO functions.  That implies that you
need to be able to pass around the memory references as kiobufs instead.
Linus has spoken --- the kiobuf abstraction was the only reason he
accepted the raw IO patches (and you'll see that the underlying IO
function in raw IO, brw_kiovec, doesn't know a single thing about
address mappings).

The sd driver should be a consumer, not a provider, of kiobufs.  That is
the reason the kiobuf abstraction was added.
