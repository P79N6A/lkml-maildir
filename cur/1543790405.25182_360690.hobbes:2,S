That's daft.  A uniprocessor machine has one and only one CPU and it's
always online!   An online_map is only needed for MP.
Now conceptually, yes, we should be able to query and perhaps set the
onlineness of a CPU.  But that doesn't mean that we should have storage
which idiotically remembers something which was known at compile time.

Ths presence of cpu_online_map in UP builds _is_ a special case.  The
kernel's overall approach to such things is to optimise them away at
compile time for !SMP builds.
