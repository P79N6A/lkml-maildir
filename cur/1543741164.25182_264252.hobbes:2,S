#   [PNPBIOS] disable if ACPI is active
#   
#   As further ACPI pnp functionaility is implemented it is no longer
#   safe to run ACPI and PNPBIOS concurrently.
#   
#   We therefore take the following approach:
#   - attempt to enable ACPI support
#   - if ACPI fails (blacklist etc.) enable pnpbios support
#   - if ACPI support is not compiled in the kernel enable pnpbios support
#
