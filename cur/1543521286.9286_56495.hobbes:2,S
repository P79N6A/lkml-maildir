For embedded systems I can see it is an issue, /proc is simply too large
to include just for a few constants.

Embedded boxes need a way to write to sysctl stuff. People are very close to
having nice working linux embedded stuff without any fs code even linked into
the kernel core.

cp -r, loopback nfs mount, .. ?
sysctl is used by some applications so its a back compatibility call we end
