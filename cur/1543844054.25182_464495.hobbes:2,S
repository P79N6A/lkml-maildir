Actually rereading through your posts with this correction in mind
I find this to actually be one of the most interesting ideas I've
seen of late. There's probably not a 1-to-1 correlation here, but
some of the problems mentioned seem similar to RCU stuff (modify
pointer, make sure nobody's got copy to it, etc.), tough I could
be wrong.
Random thoughts -- no guarantees:
Instead of freezing everything and making sure all text refs to
function are modified, you might just be able to use kprobes (on
the architectures that have it) as a trampoline for on-the-fly
address call modifications. And on the archs that don't have
kprobes, you could at build time degrade this by replacing direct
calls to instrumented functions by function pointers or localized
ifs.
Not sure.
