Would you suggest I remove the ide_unregister and place a error message if that area
is ever called in the pnp ide driver or is it better to leave it in there?  I'd like
to get this patch out soon so users can take advantage of these changes.  Becuase
pnp does not currently support hotplugging, I doubt there will be any problems.
Thanks,
Adam
