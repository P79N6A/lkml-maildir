Thanks all for the answers.
I could load by specifying lower amount of memory but on the newer
platform(does not exist), some of the existing components will
not exist while some newer ones will be added. So, it won't be
entirely accurate but I could still get some idea by trying
it out.
Thanks,
Ravi

Have a look at this script so show RAM used by programs:

Note to display totals you will need this patch applied:
