Nack. 
V4L1 is an obsolete api, just like OSS, marked at
feature-removal-schedule.txt to be removed on July (probably, we might
need to postpone this, but this is another question). 
This API have serious trouble on handling video and audio standards used
on analog world and should be discontinued in favor of V4L2 API. Like
ALSA have, V4L2 drivers also have a compatibility driver that changes
calls from legacy userspace applications into newer V4L2 calls (of
course losing several features, working fine only for a few video
standards that were supported by V4L1).
Cheers, 
Mauro.
