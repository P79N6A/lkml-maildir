Because it's ridiculous.  Why not provide another config variable for choosing
between egcs and gcc ?  And between gcc-2.7.2.3 and gcc-2.8 and gcc-2.8.1 for
those lucky few having all of them installed ?
If you want to tweka the performance by twekaing the compile options, edit the
Makefile.  It's really not difficult.
