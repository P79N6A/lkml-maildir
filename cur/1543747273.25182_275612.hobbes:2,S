So long as its different enough that you can have current XPath
implementations be able to separate the XPath from the filename, it
should be fine.
Really simple example,
file#foo
Is #foo handled by XPath, or passed to the file system?

What I was suggesting is that if your not careful, it may not be
possible for current libraries to know the difference between its XPath
like stuff and whatever is done in the file system.
