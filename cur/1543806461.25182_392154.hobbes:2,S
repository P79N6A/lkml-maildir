Hi everybody,
The good news is that I finally succeeded to boot over network
using the PXE-bootrom / ip dhcp autoconfig / nfsroot method.
But "ip=dhcp root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=%s" is not the way to go
with recent kernels. This results in a kernel panic caused by
the inability to find root. Things go wrong immediately after
rpc port lookup:
 > NFS: Buggy server - nlink == 0!
 > nfs_fhget failed
Well, adding ",v3" to the nfsroot parameter helps, forcing the
client not to use the default nfs version 2 but nfs version 3.
All machines use kernel 2.6.15-git7.
cu,
 Knut
