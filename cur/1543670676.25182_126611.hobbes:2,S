stat() family, ustat(2), quota syscall, ioctls that pass device numbers,
/dev/raw, RAID, probably process accounting.
FWIW, I believe that you are overestimating the amount of internal code
that cares about device numbers.  Recent example: tty drivers.  99% of
references to tty->device were of form
	minor(tty->device)-tty->driver.start_minor.
Adding tty->index initialized to the above
	a) cleans the code up and kills a bunch of typos
	b) is obvious (albeit minor) optimization
	c) makes much more sense from the driver POV - "that's 5th of my
ttys" vs. "when somebody opens a device with dev_t equal to 5:69, they'll
get this tty".  The latter makes sense when we are opening that sucker -
at the same time when we decide which driver will handle it in the first
place.
If anything, I'd rather see code in char_dev.c give us a triple -
file_operations, pointer to whatever object driver wanted to associate
with this device number (tty_driver, in case of tty layer) and index.
We can do that easily (drivers/block/genhd.c has almost exactly what
we need), old drivers can still use minor() to their hearts' contest
and we can start killing a *lot* of ugly warts.  Old register_chrdev()
will work as usual - just tell the char_dev.c that everything with
that major should get a triple (file_operations, NULL, minor).  No
changes required....
