But are we dealing with completely unknown states ? That's not
what I'm saying. We are dealing with:
 - Hotswap in (pcmcia, ...)
 - Firmware that don't wait after reset
 - Interfaces (like ide-pmac) that hard reset the disk
 - no POST code (power-on reset)
A completely unknown state doesn't work today and I don't think
we should really care about it. If an arch wants to deal with
such a state (which is +/- the  case of ide-pmac when booting
from MacOS), then that arch has to do the specifics of dealing
with that (in ide-pmac case, tggling the hard reset line of
the drive).
So I still think it would make sense to wait. Now, what I
suggested to Andre on IRC is that we could eventually make
that wait conditional on some HWIF flag set by the arch
(or rather the HBA driver) if you really don't want to do it in
the generic case.
