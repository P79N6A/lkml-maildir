Thanks, Stephen, for your raw-io patch.
It does work, but refuses to work for me with non sector-size aligned
buffer address. If the IO is broken into several ones, perhaps this
condition would be required, but it seems to me that only the total IO
length has to be a multiple of the sector-size.
I have implemented recently the support of unaligned Wide Transfers in the
sym53c8xx driver and I need something that provides some oddly aligned
buffers to test the driver code. If it is possible to remove the checking
of buffer alignment in your code without serious breakage, this will fit
my needs. 
Sorry if I missed something important.
Regards,
   Gérard.
