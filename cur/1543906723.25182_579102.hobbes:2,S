Is it possible to open a bugzilla and drop the acpidump and dmesg
from both the new and old BIOS in it?
Assuming the override in both cases is identical, I'm really baffled
by this failure.  It seems that the new BIOS is playing some tricks
that we have not seen before, as your hardware didn't change...
