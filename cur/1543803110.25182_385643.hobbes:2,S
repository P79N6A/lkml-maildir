I've tried to set the PCMCIA options to Y in the kernel build, but get a 
message that something else is build as a modual, so these can not be 
changed to y. I went to the .config file and replaced every =m to =y, and then 
ran make. The kernel then was built with no problem, but it reset all these 
option back to =m.
CONFIG_PCMCIA_AHA152X=m
CONFIG_PCMCIA_FDOMAIN=m
CONFIG_PCMCIA_NINJA_SCSI=m
CONFIG_PCMCIA_QLOGIC=m
CONFIG_PCMCIA_SYM53C500=m
CONFIG_I2C_STUB=m
I build kernels for G4L, and build everything directly into the kernel, but 
these do not seem to work, and I don't have an ideal why, since everything 
else is built in. So what am I missing. This is the 2.6.15 kernel. 
Thanks.
