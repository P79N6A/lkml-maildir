Too true. 
But with the new VFS semantics, wouldn't be possible for a MUA to make a
thing like the following: 
spawn a process with a private namespace. Here a minimun subset of the
"real" tree (maybe all / except /dev) is mounted readonly. The private /tmp
and /home/user are substituted by read-write directory that are in the
"real" tree /home/user/mua/fakehome and /home/user/mua/faketmp. In this
private namespace, run the "untrusted" binary. 
Now the binary can do much less harm than before, or am I missing something?
It have no access to real user data, but can use the system library and
services without changing anything in the system. 
Having the read-only flag per vfs-mount is the only kernel-related thing
here, I think; all the rest is simply user-space spice :-). 
Have a nice day,
