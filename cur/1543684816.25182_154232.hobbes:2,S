Subject: Status of ICH5-R SATA RAID support?

Howdy,
Intel's ICH5-R chipset, as found on their D875PBZ motherboard, supports
RAID-striping of SATA disks.
I've scoured the list archives and can't find any mention, for or
against, for support of this feature -- Jeff Garzik's libata patchkit,
although significant, doesn't appear to provide striping support.
Am I correct in thinking that there isn't any working striping support
at the moment -- and if so, is anyone working on an implementation?
If not, it might be fun to try and write support for it myself..
Cheers,
David
