Ah, I remember that one.  Eric Dumazet had some suggestions to fix it
6-12 months ago which never went anywhere - the thread was called "RCU
latency regression in 2.6.16-rc1".
That one is especially annoying as there's no workaround (shrinking the
route cache or reducing the GC interval via net.ipv4.route.* sysctls has
no effect)
