The Pro/100 Server Adapter is not an I2O device.  The 960 is just used
to run the firmware for the card and do buffer mnagement functions
under NT and Netware BorderManager.  The Pro100 driver won't work since
the driver has to go through the firmware and doesn't talk directly
to the 82558 MAC chips is my guess.
