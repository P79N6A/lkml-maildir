Thats now been done, but not w/o a minor disaster & an extra hour 
sorting out something heyu seems to have done.  NDI when, but its log 
output in /var/tmp has been renamed from heyu.out to heyu.outttyS1 
and thats why xtend has been getting a tummy ache.
I did have 2 partitions on that 200Gigger, one accidently way too big 
16GB swap and the rest as /amandatapes.  The minor disaster was that 
I didn't wait till I had rebooted before I ran a mke2fs -j /dev/hdd2 
(the new /var, and the amanda useage partition was left exactly the 
same, but the kernel was still runing on the old partition table so 
it formatted the amanda partition.  My bad...), so amanda is back to 
square one tonight but thinking it has a weeks backups to count on.  
But with a 7 day dumpcycle, it will be caught up in a week if I 
expand the tapetypes set size to 60Gb or so till it gets in balance.
Anyway, I now have a 15GB /var to record this crap in.
>possibility the second is to set up a serial console.
Both of my seriel ports are busy, one is watching the ups, and the 
other is running x10 stuffs.
So we'll have to take our chances that we can catch it in the logs.  
There was a single 'driver ready seek not complete' message in the 
log several days ago according to logwatch.  Its about a year old 
120GB Maxtor, and smartd is watching both of them now without send me 
any telegrams (so far, that knocking sound is me, knocking on wood).

Anyway, now we wait, except I'm going to fire off the initial amdump 
right now after telling it there is enough space on its 'tape' do do 
a level 0 on everything.  That might be interesting in itself.
