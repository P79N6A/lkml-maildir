Please understand it as the emphasis is on don't obscure and distort my 
definition in my labeling of the code of what I have copyrights to.  I 
believe that for that reason, a court would allow it.  I could be 
wrong.  That is why I ask everyone I detect for a copyright assignment, 
still to this day.  I don't 100% trust the code acceptance process to 
guarantee that I will catch everyone....
In a world with SCOs, we need to be over careful not under careful about 
such things.
