The main problem here is that one needs different kmap types depending 
on which context a function is called from (which is why I needed the 
enum as a parameter to the function).  Unfortunately, the amount of 
memory needed for ringbuffers can grow pretty large on a system with 
many tasks, so not kmapping them isn't an option.  Making it a #define 
certainly works quite well, but if someone has a better idea to the 
kmap mess, I'd love to see it improved.
