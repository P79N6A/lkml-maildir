Yeah, but even then I think the SLUB approach is a very nice one for a
general purpose system. Don't get me wrong, SLOB definitely is not good
for that :)

Right, and it takes a long long time to do anything on my 4G system ;)
But that 4MB system might not even have 50 pages that you'd want to
use for slab.
