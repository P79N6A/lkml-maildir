And sched_clock's use of local_irq_save/restore appears to be absolutely
correct, so I think it must be triggering a bug in either the self-tests
or lockdep itself.
The only way I could actually extract the test code itself was to run
the whole thing through cpp+indent, but it doesn't shed much light.
It's also not clear to me if there are 6 independent failures, or if
they're a cascade.
