So, Linus,
when I get done porting 1.2.13 to my assembler-in-Bash, do you want me calling it 
"Linux"?
The scheduler will be a bit more nimble, of course, there will be a 3-stack 
Forth-like interface to kernelspace, and the meta-superuser will run in Forreal Mode, the
true 32-bit-unprotected mode I discovered on the 386. But other than that it'll
be "an old time-sharing system", to use the Bell Labs description.
The curious should investigate the Forreal.tgz package in cLIeNUX/interim.
