Every sampling buffer format, even the default, needs a name. 
Not all measurements need a kernel level sampling buffer. In that
case they pass the NULL uuid (uuid = all zeroes).

Yes, this is sort of obscure. But any file descriptor must be associated
with a filesystem (and super block). This creates the minimum skeleton
for such filesystem. The same technique is used for pipes, tmpfs,...

Because I tried regrouping all the /proc AND related interface into a single
C file.

Well, it is not clear to me what criteria is used for /sys vs /proc. Yours
is based on whether the information is process or system-wide based. That 
looks reasonable, yet I can see evidence of just the opposite in /proc
today, such as /proc/meminfo. Is this maintained because of backward compatibility?
