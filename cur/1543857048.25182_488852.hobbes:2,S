I guess that this paragraph wasn't for me, but rather for the author of 
the HID Simple Driver proposal, am I right?

Please do, when you will have time. Any comments are very welcome, before 
I start actually heading for the merge.

Yes, the hidraw driver is one of the things that I am planning to develop 
on top of the generic HID layer, after the HID split gets merged. 
The current patches mainly take the contents of drivers/usb/input, and 
separate the code to transport-specific and the rest, which is then put 
into drivers/hid (of course some code changes are needed) and USB-specific 
HID code is then hooked into this new HID layer. 
I have tried to verify that hooking bluetooth, in the state in which it 
currently is (plus the patches which are not in mainline, also because of 
non-existence of common HID code), would stay relatively easy task, 
hopefully.
This split is quite painful, as there are many things happening in USB all 
the time, so the best way seem to be just to perform big split (with 
needed changes) at once, and then develop other things on top of it (like 
hidraw).
