hello, I am Kernel Kosh (think. military :)
I would like to know, has anyone actually been able to try a USB ACM 
compatible modem ? cause I have up to now, been unable to find one, since 
they are mostly Win98, I would like to try, if you can give me a suggestion.
Thanks you guys, keep up the good work
