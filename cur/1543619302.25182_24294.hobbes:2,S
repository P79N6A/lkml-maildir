I'd prefer if tree maintainers (that means you, Alan:-) don't apply
devfs patches that didn't come from me. I've already posted a patch
which cleans up *all* the remaining printk()'s. In fact, it's a pair
of patches, one for 2.4.x and one for 2.5.x. That was yesterday. Today
I'm still seeing this thread being beaten to death.
Besides, this is hardly an urgent fix, so there's no great rush to
apply a random patch from someone else, even if I did sit on it for a
week or two. Applying random patches will just end up generating more
merge work for me down the track.
