Two questions:  I see change logs about NAPI going in, and then
NAPI being removed.  I assume it is removed...but maybe it will
be back soon?
Second:  Where is the patch?  I looked on kernel.org and didn't
find it.  If it's going to be there shortly, that's fine, I'll
keep checking back.
Thanks,
Ben
