This is exactly what has been said before in this thread
 - i.e. mount the new FS over the old one (union style)
and new writes go to the new FS.
I really thing LVM resizing automagick would be the way to go to.
*much* cleaner and easier to implement.
The real useful thing to do would be to write a utility that would
convert non-LVM systems to LVM.
