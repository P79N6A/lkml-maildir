Why?  And what makes it impossible to extend the code to handle your
hardware.

So add it when you implement that code.

If you look at the callers it's use as gfp mask.  Feel free to send patches
to change the types to what you think makes sense.

There's no rules on how to do it anyway.  But it looks like you don't
have any arbitrary dma limits, so conditionally setting doesn't make
much sense.

That's not that bad at least.  But you'd need to convience us why
your port is the first that absolutely needs something like that.
