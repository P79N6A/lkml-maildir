That host does have a flag check on the primary channel.
The Seconday has been observed and many people have verified the second
channel works okay in 48-bit.
If you have a system which has a 28-bit limited host, and it has been
openly discussed on lkml for many months, why would one not use the
jumpon.exe from maxtor to prevent such problems.
What I want is details from the last kernel you booted and worked, because
I am positive AC's code does the correct thing.  I was one of the first
people to find the 48-bit bomb in that asic during prototype of the large
drive technology.
So please add more details, and regardless this is a semi-development
thread and nobody else has reported this error.
