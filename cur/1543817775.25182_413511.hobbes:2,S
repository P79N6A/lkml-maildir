You're  not going to find blade hardware that's cost competitive with 
barebones pc chasis on a per unit basis...
That said you over-simplifying the issue a bit. Terminator minitowers 
are 11" high so if you set them on a shelf in a rack you get 2 in 7u or 
maybe 4, if you're willing to have a cable management nightmare and a 
heat problem in the middle.
People are willing to pay a lot relatively speaking for space efficiency, 
rack hardware, sane cable cable management, and easly repalacable parts.
In general, managing costs has a lot to do with not buying what you don't 
need which in this case sounds like lots of cpu power, but in the case of 
cluster users includes cdrom drives, floppies, occasionaly harddisks etc.
