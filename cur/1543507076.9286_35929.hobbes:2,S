Yes, the bigmem patch doesn't break bttv.
bttv alloc the DMA-pool via vmalloc and with the bigmem patch applyed
vmalloc prefere the bigmem pages so the DMA-pool will be always alloced
in bigmem memory.
But using vmalloc all bigmem pages will have a valid virt-to-phys
translation. (Only GFP may return a pointer without a valid virt-to-phys
translation if __GFP_BIGMEM is been specifyed in the gfp_mask.)
So the kernel can also copy-from/to-user the DMA pool using the vmalloc
addresses since it's a _valid_ address.
Via mmap the vmalloced pages will be remapped to userspace memory and
that's fine as well.
