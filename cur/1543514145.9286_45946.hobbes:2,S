As it happens I have just re-formated all the disks that were being somewhat
thrashed (as I have just put redhat 6.1 on our system and decided to start
from scratch, and thanks to redhat for their interesting NIS (ypserv) server
RPM).  So far I have not seen any access errors, but I will continue to hit the
system hard.
Prior to reformat the disks were very heavily fragmented, due to considerable
hammering over the last 9 months or so, some up to around 20% fragmented as
well (on a 16 gig partition on a 18 gig drive).  Typically large files were
created during a run and then deleted completely.  
So perhaps the "re-used inodes" is a factor.
Here is some interesting log file entries from the pre-reinstall:
