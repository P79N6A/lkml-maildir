bugcheck on 0 is valid there, it signals memleak. page_count == -1
signals another bug that might or might not be fixed by this as far as I
can tell (this furthermore is a pte, so it sure can't have page_count ==
0 or -1). So please try to track down which pages had page_count == -1.
Note, we must not confuse page->count with page_count, for the former
value -1 means "in the freelist". For the latter it signals a bug.

that's a page_count of the _pte_, not of the pages. so we're guaranteed
it's always 1 unless we deal with this very pageattr code that is the
only one that evers boost a pte page_count to > 1.
If you mean how can we provide an universal API with only keeping track
of things with the page_count of the pte, we can't, and that's why it's
not an universal API and that's why some symmetry is required by the
API.
