Folks the change introduced in 2.6.16-rc2   over 2.6.15
wrt to the SMP initialization are wrong.
Please apply to unroll the change..
Here is the logic ...
sched_init is called from start_kernel before the
architecture specific function cpu_check_smp() is called
which is done as part of rest_init().
On s390 this actually sets the cpu_possible_map, which
is now used in sched_init through the for_each_cpu without
properly being initialized.
As a result bringing 2nd and subsequent cpu online
breaks.
This should be a quick fix, until this chicken and egg
problem is solved otherwise.
