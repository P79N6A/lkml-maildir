Perhaps true, although I know of at least one customer of Red Hat who
does have an application (or more) than uses mmap'd files and is
suffering from this lack of appropriate semantics.  They are not
getting files backed up which need to be.

It may be a no-op on recent Linux kernels, but I don't think that it
is a no-op on other systems.
I do not wish to defend applications which don't use msync or some
such, but it seems that the appropriate semantics to support are
more than just depending upon the application to "do the right thing".
    Thanx...
