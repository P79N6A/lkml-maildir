The definition of HZ is the number of units in a second.  Thus if HZ is
100 we are talking about a 10 ms jiffie.

Actually I think it is more useful to define it as something like 100
for the following reasons.  
I think it makes the most sense to keep jiffie as a simple unsigned
int.  If we leave drivers, and other code as is they can deal with
single word (32 bit) values and get reasonable results.  If we make HZ
too high (say 10,000 to get micro second resolution) we will start
limiting the max time we can handle, in this case to about 71.5 hours. 
(Actually 1/2 this value would start giving us trouble.)  HZ only
affects the kernel internals (the user API is either seconds/micro
seconds or seconds/nano seconds).  For those cases where we want a higer
resolution we just add a sub jiffie component.  Another way of looking
at this is to set up HZ as the "normal" resolution.  This would be the
resolution (as it is today) of the usual API calls.  Only calls to the
POSIX 1b timers would be allowed to have higher resolution.  I propose
that we use the POSIX standard to define "CLOCKS" with various
resolution, with the understanding that the higher resolutions will have
higher overhead.  An yet another consideration, to get high resolution
with a reasonable maximum timer interval we will need to use two words
in the timer.  I think it makes sense to use the jiffie (i.e. 1/HZ) as
the high order part of the timer's time.  
Note that all of these considerations on jiffie size hold with or with
out a tick less system.
