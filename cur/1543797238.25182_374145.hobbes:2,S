If the online map is wrong all kinds of things would go wrong.
Most likely your kernel doesn't have the fix.
The possible map is fixed kind of BTW in 2.6.15rc*. It was a side effect
of CPU hotplug, which now uses a better algorithm to guess the 
number of possible CPUs. In 2.6.15 you will just get half the number
of available CPUs in addition by default
