Hi Willy ,
thanks for your reply.
I am sure that my timer is working( TIMER0_1), because I checked the
register , it was counting , and the interrupt flag register also
gives out interrupts periodicly.
the problem is that it seems that the program just toggles here:
interrupt rountines, gic_ack(), interrupt handle
functions.............., my simulation enviorment also tells me that
invalid iqr id (0x21) is writen to EOI(end of interrupt).
I am also sure in the interrupt routine I clean the interrupt flag of the timer.
so this is roughly my situation.
does anyone have some idea?
thanks,
regards,
yang
