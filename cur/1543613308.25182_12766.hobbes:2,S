Thanks for the patch. I've thought about doing that, but it seemed to me it 
was something so much important that it would already be in some official 
kernel. 
Does it mean that NONE of the existing embedded linux is able to use a ROM 
directly as a filesystem ?? (either root fs or not)
I'm astonished. Is there some embedded-specific mailing list I'm not aware of?
Thanx,
Thomas
