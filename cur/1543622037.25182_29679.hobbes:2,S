Certainly timeofday by itself isn't enough for the various reasons you
mention.  But it does help to avoid accepting filehandles from before
the last reboot.
In my proposal there there were three numbers:
   An address
   A sequentially assigned inode number
   A time of day.
Any two of these is probably adequate most of the time, but could
occasionally result in equal filehandles for different files.  Adding
a third makes collision virtually impossible.
