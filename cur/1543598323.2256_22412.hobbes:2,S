Are there any current CPUs that can treat RAM as very fast swap, 
and be set up so that before writing a page of RAM from cache, it
gets encrypted (obviously not designed for this)
Essentially, the only data on the system that's in clear is initial boot
code, and on-chip cache.
Obviously, performance would suffer, going from Gb/s to Mb/s.
