Guys - for the last week, I've been running 2.4.19-rc2 (with the "hacky"
Athlon/AGP cache coherency fix) and it's the _only_ kernel to have
worked properly on my machine. BTW, I also added the latest O(1)
scheduler patch, but nothing else.
I use the Nvidia driver for my sins, and it triggers the Athlon "issue".
Hacky or not, -rc2 seemed to finally fix the problem, because my box
survived 6 days of relative torture, which it's _never_ got close to
before.
Being the obsessive upgrader that I am, I then built -rc3 with the same
config. Bang, the box didn't even survive 12 quiet hours. Seeing as
there are few changes between -rc2 and -rc3 (though there is something
in the AGP backend somewhere), what could cause this?
[ Machine is Athlon XP 1800+ / Via KT266A / IDE / Red Hat 7.3 ]
Cheers
