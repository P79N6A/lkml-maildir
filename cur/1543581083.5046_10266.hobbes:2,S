Subject: [UPDATE] New zerocopy against 2.4.2-pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/2/5/161

In the usual spot:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/zerocopy-2.4.2p1-1.diff.gz
Changes since last installment:
1) Merge in lots of AC patch fixes, from Alan.
2) Use more reasonable MTU for loopback under
   Zerocopy, basically it's 16K + sizeof TCP/IP headers now.
Later,
David S. Miller
