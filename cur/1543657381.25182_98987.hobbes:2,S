Well you have the best documentation of all: the code itself. I did not
find anything else other than the man page when trying to undestand it but
the code was easy to follow.

is there any real documentation on this syscall anywhere?  i.e. if one
wanted to write a daemon that dynamically dealt with nfs exports
(creating/removing/changing) this syscall would seem very appropriate
(at least as I understand), but I can't find any documentation besides
the skimpy man page on how to use it.
am I not supposed to use it? :)
thanks,
shaya
