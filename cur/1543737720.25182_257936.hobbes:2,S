It sounds to me (and please correct me if I'm wrong) like 'non
exclusive' cpusets are more like a convenient way to group tasks than
any sort of performance or scheduling imperative.  It would seem what
we'd really want here is a task grouping functionality, more than a
'cpuset'.  A cpuset seems a bit heavy handed if all we want to do group
tasks for ease of administration.

If that's all 'exclusive' means then 'exclusive' is a poor choice of
terminology.  'Exclusive' sounds like it would exclude all tasks it is
possible to exclude from running there (ie: with the exception of
certain necessary kernel threads).
