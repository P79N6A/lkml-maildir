A wrecked journal superblock or log block.  Never seen that before.
See if e2fsck can fix it up.  If not, see if you can get e2fsck to remove
the journal with
	tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/hdXX
then fsck it, then create a new journal with
	tune2fs -j /dev/hdXX
As for the assertion failure: yes, that's fairly bad form.  I'll fix that
up to simply fail the mount.
