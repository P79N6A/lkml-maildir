Hi all,
I'm in the process of trying to set an experimental WWW cache
server. The hardware is a Viglen Genie 2 Plus Pentium II 350
Mhz processor with 64 Mb of RAM. I have installed Redhat 6.0
Linux. The actual Linux kernel that I am using is 2.2.10, with
an "ac8" patch applied. A 'uname -r', reports 2.2.10-ac8.
WWW cache software to be used is squid-2.2.STABLE3. For my
purposes, I need to increase the number of file descriptors
(open files) from kernel default of 1024 to 8192. Have made
following modifications to header files:
1. Increased __FD_SETSIZE in
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/posix_types.h to 8192.
2. Increased INR_OPEN in /usr/src/linux/include/linux/fs.h
to 8192.
3. Increased __FD_SETSIZE in /usr/include/bits/types.h
to 8192.
Rebuilt kernel with above values. Kernel booted OK. Portmap
was reported as starting on boot up. However,
'/etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap status' returned 'portmap dead
but subsys locked'. '/etc/rc.d/init.d/portmap stop' returns
'Stopping portmap services: [FAILED]'. Used 'portmap -d'
and it returned, 'svc_run: - select failed: Bad address' and
'portmap[418]: run_svc returned unexpectedly'.
As an experiment, set above values to 4096 and rebuilt
kernel. Kernel booted OK. Portmapper still failed.
However, 'portmap -d' gave slightly different output
on first line, 'svc_run: - select failed: Bad file descriptor'
Finally reset above values to 1024. Rebuilt and rebooted OK
with new kernel. Guess what, portmapper works again... H E L P !
In advance, thank you to anyone who can help me solve this problem!
Kind Regards,
David Carson
