   	The second thing that bugs me is that because those patches
   pass behind my back, they won't get applied to *both* 2.4.X and
   2.5.X. Because of that, keeping 2.4.X and 2.5.X in synch is an
   exercise in futility.
This is an old topic.  If cleanups get submitted they are going
to go in.  If this means that someone has to redo a patch, that
is just a part of life.
Nobody is "above the law", sort of speak, when it comes to these
things.  Cleanups and compile warning fixes are not required to
go through the maintainer of a piece of code.
About IRDA wrt. 2.4.x vs 2.5.x, it requires a partial rewrite in 2.5.x
anyways so don't get worked up over it :)
