After looking at the spec, it seems that most of the registers we were
restoring were read-only and couldn't possibly need to be restored.
Also, the PCI PM spec suggests that only a subset of the registers
should be restored.  Finally, things like BIST should probably never be
touched.
This patch is one of the main reasons I'm looking for comments.  I
wanted to see if there are any other necessary registers.  I'm also
thinking we might want to restore some capability structures (which we
don't do now).
Thanks,
Adam
