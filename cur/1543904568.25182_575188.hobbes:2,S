Yup.  Nobody has begun to think about preserving dcache/icache across load
shifts yet, afaik.  Hard.

Well.  Hopefully this time next year you can prep a 16MB container and toss
your updatedb inside that.  Maybe set its peak disk bandwidth utilisation
too.  However that won't work ;) because I don't think anyone is looking
at containerisation of vfs cache memory yet.  Perhaps full-on openvz has it,
dunno.
But updatedb is a special case, because it is so vfs-intensive.  For lots
of other workloads (those which use heaps of pagecache), resource
management via containerisation will work nicely.
