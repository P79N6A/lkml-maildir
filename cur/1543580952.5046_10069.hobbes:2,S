	Seems to have gotten a bit worse.  Vmstat output after 'vmware' had completed
write -- but system unresponsive and writing out a 155M file...

	What is the meaning of having a process in the 'w' column?  On other
systems, I was used to that meaning an executable had been *swapped* out completely
(as opposed to no pages mapped in) and that it meant your system vm was 'thrashing'.
But that obviously isn't the case here.
	Those columns are output from a 'vmstat 5'.  Meaning it took about 70 seconds
to write out 158M.  Or about 2.2M/s.  That's probably not bad.  It still locks
up the system for over a minute though -- which is really undesirable performance
for interactive use.  I'm guessing the vmstat output numbers are showing 4K? 8K? 
blocks?  8K would about make sense for the 2.2M average.
