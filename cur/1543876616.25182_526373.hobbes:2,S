This is cifs_reopen_file.  One of the callers (find_writable_file) calls
this with the &cifs_inode->vfs_inode as inode argument, which can't be
NULL per definition.  All other callers pass
file->f_path.dentry->d_inode as inode argument, which per definition is
not never zero, because there are not file structs arount that don't
point to an inode.
Note that you could nicely simplify the find_writable_file calling
conventions by not passing the inode argument explicitly at all, but
rather always deriving it from file->f_path.dentry->d_inode inside
the function body.

Same again here, there's no fscking chance read/write could ever work
without a dentry or inode.
