Khm... this does not look simple. Seems, right way involves modification
of each place, where the same ports are used by kernel.
pcmcia-cs had completely private resource manager, so that it just
did not worry about other subsystems and they still were able to allocate
the same resources.
Look f.e. at extermal example, pnpbios announces as "system" resource
all the memory. :-)
Pallaitive soultions, sort of reserving of ports >= 0x1000 using
this information do not look cool too.
