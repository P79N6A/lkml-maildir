How many?
I don't believe there are that many at all. I believe they are extremely
rare, and probably almost exclusively in the domain of fbcon. In short, I
believe that it could be just a fbcon header file.
I refuse to overdesign. You'd better show it working _first_, and then
show me that it is actually commonly useful before I start considering it
a "supported interface" kind of issue. In the meantime, it is much better
to compartmentalize and make things modular - I don't see any reason at
all for the generic header files to care about what specific drivers do.
