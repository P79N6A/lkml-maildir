Subject: 2.5.38: oops with kernel LLC support enabled
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Firstly, a big thanks to Ingo for kksymoops...  2.5.38 panics right
out of the chute with no way to save the oops output, so it's REALLY
nice to have it decoded on the screen!!  Manual transcription of the
oops output follows below.
What was I trying to do with LLC support?  I have an old JetDirect
interface in a LJ-III that speaks DLC/LLC only, and wanted to try to
use it with Linux.  (It should go without saying that NT and Win2K
can talk to it just fine :-)).  Both machines in a sample set of two
panic the same way...  One is a desktop with the NIC driver built-in.
The other (that produced the oops output below) is a Dell Latitude CPxJ
with a modular Xircom Tulip cardbus driver.
I guess I should mention that I haven't tried this with a 2.4 kernel.
