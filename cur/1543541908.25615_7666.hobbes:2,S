Yes, HFS is an ugly hack. I don't think Linux really makes it any
uglier...
NTFS's streams are also an ugly hack. However, we should allow the ugly
hack to work as well as possible without major upheaval: that entails
supporting the file:stream convention. This also has the advantage it
works on "native" filesystems without any extra work - a welcome bonus.
Neither is true of any of the other approaches mentioned so far, IIRC.
Incidentally, both NTFS and HPFS support "OS/2 Extended Attributes". I
would be inclined to support an extra pair of API calls to support access
to these - get_os2ea() and set_os2ea(), perhaps?
