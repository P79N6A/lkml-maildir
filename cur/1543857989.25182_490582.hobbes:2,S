yup, thanks.

The previous version didn't look too intrusive.  But it would be nice to
have a plan to get rid of the macros:
#define xtime_lock	ktimed.xtime_lock
and just open-code this everywhere.

What I meant was: if we're not going to to aggregate all these globals like
this:
	ktimed.xtime_lock
	ktimed.wall_to_monotonic
then it would be nice if they were at least aggregated by naming convention:
	time_management_time_lock
	time_management_wall_to_monotonic
	etc
so the reader can see that these things are all part of the same subsystem.
But the proposed ktimed.xtime_lock achieves that, and has runtime benefits
too.
Can we please not call it ktimed?  That sounds like a kernel thread to me. 
time_data would be better.

A single patch there would suffice, I suspect.

That might be a sprinkle of per-arch patches, but I'm not sure what is
entailed here.
