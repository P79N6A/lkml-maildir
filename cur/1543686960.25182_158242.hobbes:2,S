I realized that when I recompiled kernel from 2.4.21 to 2.6.0 it could
still be crashed on-demand. But when I replaced the 2.4.21 back it wouldn't
crash. But in meantime, when I replaced the IDE disk for another with the
same kernel, the crash could still be done on-demand.
I tried to copy the swap (disk map: 1G swap @ the beginning, ext2 the rest)
from the crashdisk to noncrashdisk verbatim if it's not dependent on the
content read (the crash was within first 10 seconds, with 40MB/s it's less than
400M from the beginning of the disk) and it didn't help. It seems it is highly
dependent on a sequence of some highly irrelevant operations during the startup
of the kernel.
