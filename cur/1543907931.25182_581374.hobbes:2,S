I doubt it's a worth optimization. It's a rare codepath and, moreover,
this optimization is sub-optimal. e.g. the rest of tasks that
contributed to 'rq->nr_running > 1' could be SCHED_NORMAL (or of lower
rt_prio) and so resched_task() is useless as well.
I guess, the following thing would do a better job:
- we do need reschedule() _only_  if there are other task on the
_same_ queue (for this prio level) :
(1) if there is a task with a higher prio, resched_task() would be
called in other place;
(2) if there are tasks of lower prio, we don't care.
I may be wrong, but at the first glance it looks like the following
trick would do the job.. no?
p.s. even if it's ok, it's still a rare codepath (although, it adds
some code to the rare path.. so the drawback is only code-size, I
guess).
