  I use Linux 2.2.7, and I have seen a couple of very stange messages in
my logs today:
May  5 23:10:07 coruscant kernel: keyboard: unknown scancode e0 34
May  5 23:10:07 coruscant kernel: keyboard: unknown scancode e0 34
Does anyone know what does it mean, and if it is something I need to care
about at all.
My keyboards seams to work very well, though.
          Thanks,
                  DindinX
