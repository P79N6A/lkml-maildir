Replace the spinlock in b44_start_xmit by the irq_{save/restore} version.
Do the same around for spin_lock(&np->dev->xmit_lock); in netpoll_send_skb.
If it helps, it's an ugly, buggy, bandaid and you should consider
capturing the messages through a serial cable instead.
If you want to read the details, see the thread "Netconsole violates
dev->hard_start_xmit synch rules" started the 06/09/2005 on
