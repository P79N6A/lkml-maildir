Hello relayfs devs,
the documentation to the [old] relayfs (2.6.10-patch from opersys):
absolute path to the channel file on relayfs.  If, for example, the
caller sets channel_path to "/xlog/9", a "xlog/9" entry will appear
within relayfs automatically and the "xlog" directory will be created
This is wrong. If I use /xlog/9, I get a dentry with zero length, e.g.:
/dev/relay # ls -l
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root      0 Mar 25 09:52
drwxr-xr-x   3 root root      0 Mar 25 12:05 .
drwxr-xr-x  39 root root 183712 Mar 25 13:42 ..
-rw-------   1 root root      0 Mar 25 09:52 a_channel
(the channel would be /dev/relay//xlog/9, but that's impossible, since multiple
/ are merged). Works well when I use "xlog/9".
