>objcopy: not stripping symbol `__ksymtab_strings' because it is named in a relocation
Another thing I've never seen in any of my builds - these strings always
get relocations against the corresponding section symbol.

I'd rather insert a second objcopy attempt here with just --strip-debug.

With this and the previous issue I certainly wouldn't mind this and the
subsequent vmlinux stripping patches to be reverted, and I'd aim at
providing an improved version for .30.

In a separate response I already explained what the goal here is - size
reduction (i.e. making distro package sizes as well as foot print on disk
smaller, thus improving the already existing stripping). And it's not only
about __crc_*, those are just the ones that when removed have the
biggest overall effect. And, as pointed out above, the vmlinux stripping
patch, which has an even more significant effect as it reduces the in-
memory kernel size when using KALLSYMS_ALL, depends on this one.
I have to admit that I generally dislike the tendency for everything to
always only grow, and hence I'm trying to find opportunities to shrink
stuff where possible. I've got a couple of other patches in my local
queue that also aim in that direction, plus there are a few thoughts on
improvements beyond that.
