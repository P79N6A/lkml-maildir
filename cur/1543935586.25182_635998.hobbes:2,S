UTF-8 already works fine in git.  There is some support in recent versions
to allow commit messages and users to be specified in other encodings.
I think the issue here is with mailers modifying the encoding of data in
message files.
My reply header should be to Jörn, with a proper 'o' with two dots over it.
By default, my mailer wants to encode the message in iso-8859-1.  If I add
a single unicode character, say '‣', then the whole message will get
encoded in UTF-8.
UTF-8 has the advantage of supporting nearly all character sets.  The extra
space needed isn't really an issue for usernames or for comment messages.
