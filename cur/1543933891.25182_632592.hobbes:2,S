Subject: [PATCH 35/52] KVM: x86 emulator: retire ->write_std()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/30/40

Theoretically used to acccess memory known to be ordinary RAM, it was
never implemented.  It is questionable whether it is possible to implement
it correctly.
