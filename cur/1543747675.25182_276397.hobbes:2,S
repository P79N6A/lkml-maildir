While this may be true of those on the Linux Kernel Mailing List, I
would hope (from your statement of "Linux Culture", this would involve
things periphially related to Linux, such as KDE), that ideas and
suggestions would actually carry _some_ wait.
Although I can fully understand developers of the Linux Kernel taking
this mindset, since it is not dealing with such things as the User
Interface.
Just something I've had to deal with recently. Don't mind me.
