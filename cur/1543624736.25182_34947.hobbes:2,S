The ISA bus doesn't time out, but the PCI access before it gets
forwarded to the ISA bus _does_, if the ISA bus is decoded using
nagative decoding.
This is why it's important that there not be a motherboard PCI device
that can decode the port - because if there is, the access is
potentially a much faster PCI-only decode.
Note that this really only matters on low-end machines anyway, as the
whole "inb_p()" thing tends to be used only for old ISA devices.  If you
have a new machine that is all PCI, I doubt that port 80h access matters
not at all. 
(Another way of saying it: if you have a machine with a PCI POST card,
none of this will matter)
