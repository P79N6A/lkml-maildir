Subject: Strange message in log upon resuming a PCIe system

A bcm43xx user is having problems with suspend/resume with a PCIe system. This may be the first time
we have tried to resume with PCIe. The problem occurs someplace within the initialization of the
bcm43xx chip and we are still tracing it; however, there are some strange messages in the log from
the pnp, namely:
pnp: Device 00:04 does not support activation.
pnp: Device 00:05 does not support activation.
How does one trace back these device numbers? The output of 'lspci -v' shows the following:
