Thanks for the recommendation! I installed a Dell Truemobile 1150 in a 
(gift) Thinkpad R40 last week. Worked perfectly in WinXP and Knoppix 
3.3, no fussing with (PrismII) drivers in either case.
Also, the antenna leads were plenty long enough, and I didn't see any 
BIOS authorization problems (as mentioned at 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0312.2/0147.html
).
