Hello,
I noticed this behaviour in 2.4.18 and it is still reproducible with
2.4.19pre8. With devfs, the /dev/sound/ directory allways contains four
mixer devices, even when all sound drivers are unloaded. There are also
other device files that do not appear and disappear when not needed. If
this is a feature (what I doubt), then it is a very bad one. It is not
consitent with default devfs behaviour or even other versions of it.
# ls /dev/sound
audio
dspW
mixer0
mixer1
mixer2
mixer3

sequencer2
Gruss/Regards,
Eduard.
