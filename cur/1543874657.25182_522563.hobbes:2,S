I quite fail to understand the enthusiasm for these patches.  All they
do is make the already ugly interfaces to hugetlb more obscure than at
present, and open the door to even uglier stuff later.  Don't you need
to wait for at least one other user of these interfaces to emerge,
to get a better idea of whether they're appropriate?
