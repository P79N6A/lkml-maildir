A few configuration bugs:
 - CONFIG_USB_UHCI and CONFIG_USB_UHCI_ALT should be able to be selected
   as modules at the same time.  Currently they are not.
 - USB Serial menu should be below "USS720 parport driver"
 - If USB_SERIAL = 'M' then USB_SERIAL_DEBUG should be not be shown.
 - USB_SERIAL_IR does not show up in the menu, is this due to there not
   being a help entry for it?
 - HOTPLUG_PCI_COMPAQ should be tristate.
thanks,
