Hi, all.  Good news!
nVidia recently released programming info for its NV\d+ products, like 
the Riva TNT, TNT2, 128, &c.  
URL: 
https://www.nvidia.com/nv/nvarch.nsf/
I heard about them as leader of the REP ( 
http://web.chad.org/dev/riva-tnt
 )
but since I don't have enough guts or time to undertake making a good FBCON 
implementation for the NV architecture, I thought I'd pass it along.
I am /really/ interested in the progress of any attempt, so to anyone who
bothers to take a whack, I'd like to hear the sound.  I'm most interested
in whether the info is sufficient for real use, but I'd like to stir some
code, too.
