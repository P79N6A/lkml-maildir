These threads can block waiting for a hardware DMA engine, which has a 28
second timeout setpoint.

After placing a message in a local message queue, one SGI system partition
will interrupt another to retrieve the message. We need to minimize the
time from entering XPC's interrupt handler to the time that the message
can be DMA transferred and delivered to the consumer (like XPNET) to
whom it was sent.

I think a non-halting kthread_create() should be sufficient. It is in
effect what XPC has now in calling kernel_thread() directly.
Taking it one step further, if you added the notion of a thread pool,
where upon exit, a thread isn't destroyed but rather is queued ready to
handle the next kthread_create_quick() request.

This would also address the problems we see with huge pid spaces for
kernel threads on our largest machines.  In the example from last week,
we had 10 threads each on 4096 cpus.  If we reworked work_queues to use
the kthread_create_nonblocking() thread pool, we could probably collapse
the need for having all of those per-task, per-cpu work queues.
