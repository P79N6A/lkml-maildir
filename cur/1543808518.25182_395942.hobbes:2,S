Duuude ... could you all calm down and get the facts together? What if you'd all
be in the same room with a knife by the hand every one of you?!
I suggest Joerg summarizes the facts from his point of view _in detail_ and
people are going to respond to it. I think it pretty useless to get people
respond to you, Joerg, where you just drop a two-liner where one line is that
someone is stupid or not as good at something and the other line is a quick
statement that just always leaves place for people to ask more questions and
proceed arguing.
Please clarify. Summarize. This whole thing turns into some totally useles infitine
state machine...
Thanks anyone for your eyes. :)
