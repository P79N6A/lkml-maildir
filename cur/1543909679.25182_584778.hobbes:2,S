Considering some people may want to differentiate between "those who want
to be Cc'ed for patches on subsystem X" and "those who are maintainer(s)
of subsystem X", I think another "P=" kind of tag might also be useful
here.

I'd really _love_ a tool that does all that what you've proposed above!
But why does it have to be "git-info" or anything in the git(7) suite for
that matter? This sounds like a job for a different specialised tool,
along with ".metatags" kind of files dispersed in the source tree.
