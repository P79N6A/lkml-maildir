The sites are broken. They are running crap firewalls (often Cisco) that
probably haven't been updated (or have no update available), and they see the
(perfectly standards compliant) 'I support ECN' flag, think it must be
something evil and drop the packet silently.
ECN is an important factor for the future scalability of the Internet. It
allows for much smarter methods for congestion control. It's important that
it get implemented, but these crappy firewalls are standing in the way.
