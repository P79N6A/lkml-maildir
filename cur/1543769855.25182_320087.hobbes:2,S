Yes, an empty include/asm-um/elf.h which is not by default replaced by a 
symlink. Sadly a patch which should have been deleted it simply emptied it 
(courtesy of quilt). So
include/asm-um/elf.h:
	$(call create_the_symlink)
(which is pseudo-code) won't create it.
As a last resort I'll force that symlink to be unconditional (I hope not 
needing this).
