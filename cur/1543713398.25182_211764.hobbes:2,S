Greetings,
Today I upgraded from 2.6.4 to 2.6.5 using my config from 2.6.4.  I have all 
the usual options set for text console such as CONFIG_INPUT=y, CONFIG_VT=y, 
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y, CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y.  However in the 2.6.5 upgrade when 
booting onto this new kernel all my text consoles from tty1-6 are all blank 
after Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.20.  This is the last thing I see 
before everything goes blank.  The next thing that pops up is the X server.
Any ideas why this is happening?
Thanks for your time and help.
Regards,
Jason Harrison
