To follow myself up. I should have checked HEAD before writing this :/
Linus merged it all last night and I blamed him wrongly, sorry. 
So that problem will be hopefully gone.
For completeness the unwind fixes that went in were:
Jan Beulich 	[PATCH] x86: Make backtracer fallback logic more bullet-proof
Andi Kleen 	[PATCH] i386: Add kernel thread stack frame termination 
Andi Kleen 	[PATCH] x86_64: Add kernel thread stack frame termination 
and this one fixed an additional bug in the old x86-64 unwinder:
Keith Owens 	[PATCH] x86_64: Save original IST values for checking
