Ok, that's the different approach of analyzing problems. On s390 we
prefer dumps of a crashed system, since that is much easier to
debug than a kernel that just printed some lines and then went on
as if nothing happened. Besides the nice side effects that a BUG()
statement has of course.

I'm talking of a specific problem where we just added a panic to the
zfcp device driver. If that panic ever triggers we know for sure that
memory corruption happened.
So I'm just asking to not say in general that panic() in a device driver
is a bad thing.

IOMMU and s390 don't fit together.

On our internal tests, yes. Otherwise it's of course up to the distros.
Btw. the default implementation for BUG() is panic(). See asm-generic/bug.h.
