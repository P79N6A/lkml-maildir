How did you plan on disabling interrupts?
Did you see the MSI discussion that going on now in linux-pci mailing list?

I'd think you want to stop DMA for all devices.
Just to prevent them from messing more with memory
that you want to dump - ie get a consistent snapshot.
Leaving VGA devices alone should be safe.

*lots* of PCI devices predate PCI2.3. Possibly even the majority.
