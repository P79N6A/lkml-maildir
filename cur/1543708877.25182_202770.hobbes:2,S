Supposing that this is the case, you may get warnings.
Well, good, maybe somebody will fix glibc. The data
types are obviously the same size, so no data-corrupting
errors will result.
Note that x86-64, a 64-bit port using glibc, is just
fine with "long long" already.
Also note that /usr/include/asm is a modified copy of
kernel headers. It won't be suddenly changing as a
result of the patch, even after a kernel upgrade.
