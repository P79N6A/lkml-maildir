This looks related to something i also bumped into;
scsi scan: host 2 channel 0 id 0 lun 0 identifier too long, length 60, max
50. Device might be improperly identified.
The 'HBA' is idescsi with a memorex cdrw with an inquiry returning a
length value of 34
scsi_check_fill_deviceid:
...
	if (scsi_check_id_size(sdev, 26 + id_page[3]))
I wrote up an ugly hack to truncate the length in idescsi_transform_pc2,
but i don't know SCSI and it doesn't seem right.
