Yes, this is the extreme case.  In normal cases I would just
expect to push to one side and probably shrink it to 0.  I guess
I have something against implying a hierarchal relationship that
does not exist.

Right.  To me it looks like separate cases.  What I keep envisioning
scanning the PCI devices and then realizing they are behind
a bridge.  Before I go to far I guess I should ask.
The splitting/pushing aside looks especially useful for those
cases where you subdivide the resource again.
As for the bridge case I think that is something different.
