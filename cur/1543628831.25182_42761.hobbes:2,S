You have that slightly wrong.
First, this is a development kernel, i.e. using it means it may not 
compile, it may not work, or worse, it may destroy all your data.
Second, the kernel compiles fine as long as you don't make use of any of 
the currently broken features. A blank statement "the kernel doesn't 
compile" is more often then not incorrect and should say "the kernel 
doesn't compile with my .config" instead.
The developmental kernel series is for that... Just as the block layer was 
"flaky" while Jens was working on it in early 2.5.x and just as IDE is 
"flaky" at the moment, now scsi is joining the club. (-;
If you want kernels that will compile and work you should be using 2.4.x or 
2.2.x kernels...
Best regards,
Anton
