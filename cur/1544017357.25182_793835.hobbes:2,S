Subject: Ext4 tree backports for 2.6.27.10 and 2.6.28
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I've created a couple of ext4 backport branches which have been uploaded
to the ext4 git tree:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git 
   
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git
The master branch contains the latest ext4 patch queue, against Linus's
tip; currently, this is versus 2.6.29-rc2.  The 'for_linus' tag is
located on this branch, and currently contains a number of urgent fixes
that I plan to be pushing to Linus after he gets back from
linux.conf.au.  They are mostly fixes that prevent OOPS or cpu lockups
when ext4 mounts an intentionally corrupted filesystem.
The ext4-stable branch is based off of 2.6.28, and contains all of the
patches which were pushed to linus during the 2.6.29-rc1 merge window,
plus the fixes listed above in the 'master' branch.  It is designed for
people who want the very latest in the ext4 tree versus a stable kernel.
The for-stable branch is currently based off of 2.6.28, and contains a
candidate set of patches to be included in the 2.6.28.y stable tree.
Ext4 developers --- I would appreciate it if you could review the
patches on the ext4-stable tree, and see if I missed any patches which
in your opinion should be pushed to the 2.6.28.y tree.  Furthermore, if
some folks could test the for-stable branch and let me know whether or
not you found it stable, I would appreciate it.  Some of the patches
were relatively painful to backport, given the desire to remove
"non-critical" patches, so I'm not 100% certain I got the backports
completely right.  Please test!
The for-stable-2.6.27 is currently based off of 2.6.27.11, and it
contains a candidate set of patches to be incuded in the 2.6.27.y tree.
It was even more difficult to backport these patches to 2.6.27.y, and so
I would **really** appreciate if some folks could review and test this
branch.  In addition, a number of changes (in particular some of
Aneesh's resize race condition patches) were painful enough that I
decided to abort and not try to do the backport.  It was late, and I was
getting tired....  If someone would like to try to backport some of
these missing patches, I would appreciate it; Aneesh, you might have
better luck since they were originally your patches, and they were
complicated enough that I was worried that there might have been
prerequisites that I had missed so they would function correctly.
The patch backports can be summarized in this table below.  It contains
the original mainline commit ID, the commit ID in the 2.6.28 for-stable
branch, and the commit ID in the for-stable-2.6.27 branch.  If you see
"-----" in the column for the 2.6.27-stable column, those were patches
which I did not backport due to lack of valor/courage at 11pm at night.
