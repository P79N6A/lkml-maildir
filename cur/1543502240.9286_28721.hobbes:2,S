any suggestion how to test such possible memory errors ?
compiling kernel or X11 multiple times (multiple parallel sessions)
don't show any problem.  memtest86 doesn't seem to do a good job 
in detecting e.g. refresh problems or similar where you have to wait 
a long time without touching memory before errors occur.

I doubt so (in my case).  this is only a single internal cable with two
separate active terminators.

I've already done similar tests with multiple md5sum runs on all files on that fs
with no error at all. now I've done ~20 runs on the raw partition (2.6GB), all 
checksums are identical.
