No, that shouldn't be needed.
Look at the code-path: the kernel has the page locked, so nothing will
de-allocate the swap entry - so it's perfectly ok to increase it later. I
dislike the "magic" __get_swap_page(2) thing - we might make
get_swap_page() itself _always_ return a swap entry with count two (one
fot eh swap cache, one for the user), or we should keep it the way it was
(where we explicitly increment it for the user).

Ok. How about making try_to_unuse() just get the VM semaphore instead of
the page table lock?
Then try_to_unuse() would follow all the right rules, and the above
problem wouldn't exist..
