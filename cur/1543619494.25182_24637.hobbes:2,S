Ummm, I don't see how this worst case is any more realistic
as the worst case for the hash table (where all pages live
in very few hash buckets and we have really deep chains).
People just don't go around caching a single page each for
all of their 10 GB files and even if they _wanted to_ they
couldn't because of the readahead code.
I suspect that for large files we'll always have around
min_readahead logically contiguous pages cached, if not more.

Rik
