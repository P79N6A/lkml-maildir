no, what i want to have is support for on-demand shared-physical-memory
hardware. Resource management. Alan has listed a few examples, and the
list is not expected to get smaller. You are right, if we want to have big
chunks of physical memory then we'll allocate it on reboot.
i dont think it's correct to say: 'anything that cannot be segmented in
the physical memory space with page granularity, is considered to be
broken in this regard and is not guaranteed to be 100% supported by the
Linux architecture'.

no, as i pointed it out:

plus, i'd like to point out that if we do something, we preferredly want
to do it 100% correct, especially if the 'packet loss' is visible by
user-space as well. But i'm not at all requesting it:

       ^^^^^^^^^^---(this might as well be the case)
