What's wrong with using / as the separator?  It is already
used to separate components of pathnames.  Named streams
are very much like files in a subdirectory.
This scheme makes for very little change to existing tools,
users may then do a "gimp somefile/icon.jpg"  for example.
Or "ls somefile/*" to see all the named streams/forks.
