My name is Rhoda Gibson, I am a senior partner in the firm of Midland Consulting Limited: Private Investigators and Security Consultants. 
We are conducting a standard process investigation on behalf of HSBC, the International Banking Conglomerate.
 This investigation involves a client who shares the same surname with you and also the circumstances surrounding
 investments made by this client at HSBC Republic,the Private Banking arm of HSBC. 
The HSBC Private Banking client died intestate and nominated no successor in title over the
 investments made with the bank. The essence of this communication with you is to request 
you provide us information/comments on any or all of the four issues:
 1-Are you aware of any 
relative/relation who shares your same name whose last known contact address was Brussels Belgium? 
2-Are you aware of any investment of considerable value made by such a person at the Private Banking Division of HSBC Bank PLC? 
3-Born on the 1st of october 1941 
4-Can you establish beyond reasonable doubt your eligibility to assume status of successor in title to the deceased? 
It is pertinent that you inform us ASAP whether or not you are familiar with this personality that we may put an end 
to this communication with you and our inquiries surrounding this personality. You must appreciate that we are 
constrained from providing you with more detailed information at this point. 
Please respond to this mail as soon as possible to afford us the opportunity to close this investigation. 
Thank you for accommodating our enquiry.
 Rhoda c. Gibson.
