Hi,
    I'm having problems with the kernel debugger on a number of machines
with Intel SE7500CW2 motherboards.
    When attempting to enter the debugger, either by pressing "PAUSE" or at
a breakpoint, one of  four things will happen:
    1.  It works as expected.
    2. It reboots.
    3.  It hangs.  ie. input seems to have no effect, no signs of activity,
forced to power down.
    4.  It prints:
            PCI System Error on Bus/Device/Function 00B0h
            PCI Parity Error on Bus/Device/Function 00B0h
        and then continues to function as expected.
    In addition, it also occasionally hangs or reboots after entering the
debugger successfully and using it for a short while.
    I'm using a 2.4.18 kernel, and the problems are only happening on Intel
SE7500CW2 motherboards (ie.  I don't have problems on say an Intel SDS2).
    Has anyone seen any similar problems?  Has anyone had problems using
this motherboard?  Does anyone have any suggestions?
Thanks,
Jason Zebchuk
