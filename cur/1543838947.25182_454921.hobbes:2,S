I will try 2.6.18-rc4 and keep you informed.

I tried 2.6.17.7.
But I'm really not sure that the 2.6 is a regression from 2.4, in fact I
think it does better by default.
The stock 2.4.31 kernel I was using had serial overruns at 9600 bauds
already. Once patched with the low latency/preemptive kernel patchs, it
was way better and I had only overruns at 115200 bauds.
With the 2.6.17.7 kernel (configured with CONFIG_PREEMPT and
CONFIG_HZ=1000), I'm seeing overruns starting at 38400 bauds. So
compared to plain 2.4, it's better. However compared to the patched
2.4, it's worse.
(the figures are *very approximative* as the overruns haven't been
detected with the same test conditions on 2.4 and on 2.6)
I have no result with the 2.6.17.7 patched with the real time patch of
Ingo/Thomas since it currently doesn't work on my card (see my separate
bugreport).
(those questions may have been directed to Lee but I'll respond in my case
as well)

I tried that option with the 2.4 kernel and it didn't improve the situation
at all, and I haven't retried it with the 2.6 yet. But I will do.

I'm using only 16550 and I have no choice here, it's an "off the shelf"
card.

I'm seeing overruns.
