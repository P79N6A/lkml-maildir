| Cyrill,
| 
| randconfig testing in x86.git found a build bug and i bisected it to 
| your patch - output is below. Config attached. Looks like some config 
| file dependency hell problem? The dependencies there definitely need a 
| good look and a handful of cleanups as well.

Oh, Ingo, really sorry...
Give me some time to handle it.
