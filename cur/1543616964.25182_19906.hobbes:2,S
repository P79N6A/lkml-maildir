Well, in fact reiserfs_add_entry won't do that anyway, consider this code:
    retval = reiserfs_find_entry (dir, name, namelen, &path, &de);
    if( retval != NAME_NOT_FOUND ) {
        if (buffer != small_buf)
            reiserfs_kfree (buffer, buflen, dir->i_sb);
        pathrelse (&path);
        if (retval != NAME_FOUND) {
            reiserfs_warning ("zam-7002:" __FUNCTION__ ": \"reiserfs_find_entry\" has returned"
                              " unexpected value (%d)\n", retval);
       }
        return -EEXIST;
    }
Though I see other places where code is not that smart. I'll come up with additional patch later today.
Thanks for noticing.
Bye,
    Oleg
