  And those of us who tried it and decided that it's the wrong solution to a
  set of non-problems think otherwise.
imo it's a far cleaner and transparent way of doing things, which
solves one or two little problems along the way, (eg dynamic
devices).

  What /dev admin maintenance?  Perhaps my machines don't have enough disks,
  but I have never needed to perform significant work in /dev.
  
ok /dev maintenance is not a regular thing. But when you have to do
it, it can be a pain. Eg permissions. With devfs you can specify that
certain classes of devices should have a certain permission, eg scsi
disks should be root:disk 660. And if you add a disk - even during
runtime! - the devfs daemon will make it so by communicating with
kernel devfs. ie the device is created with those perm's. it's not
created and then chown/chmod'd. (which could leave it vulnerable for
a split second). 
Notice that the policy is maintained in userspace by devfsd.
