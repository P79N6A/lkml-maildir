The problem seems to occur only in kernel 2.4.x (I've tried both
2.4.17-rc1 and 2.4.13-ac5) but not in kernel 2.2.19.
Under Windows 2000 I haven't noticed anythoing strange.
The latest kernel oops I saw is :
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ....
while the call trace is :
EIP : __mark_inode_dirty()
try_to_free_buffers()
block_sync_page()
kernel_thread()
Thanks
