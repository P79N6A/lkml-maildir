I have a quick question regarding the ethertap device and routing.  We're seeing
the contents of the packet coming up through the ethertap device just fine, but
the originating address seems to be overwritten with the ethertap device's
address.
Am I missing something obvious here?  I'm positive that this isn't how it's
supposed to work, but I don't know enough about the routing/forwarding stuff in
the kernel to know what I need to change.
Thanks,
Chris
