Björn,
Yes you have to change the procps to read the new /proc/stat
For example, after separating the load and disk IO measurements, also 
separating for per user at the kernel level, I had to introduce new code 
into procps/ to reflect those changes
Otherwise those tools (top, uptime etc) would not know the new formats etc.
Thanks
