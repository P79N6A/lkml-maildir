I've looked over the sym-2 and it is using pci_map_sg so it's 64-bit
safe for sg transfers at least. For non-sg requests you are using
pci_map_single, but you can't do any better because the mid layer is
handing you virtual addresses in request_buffer currently anyways...

You are doing it right :-)
