Well there was a problem in 2.6.16, which was fixed by 2.6.18, although
I am not sure if it was done by 2.6.17.  It would loose characters due
to buffer overflow and not properly checking under high load.  I grabbed
a few patches from the git tree that were added after 2.6.16 to fix the
tty problems I was having.
