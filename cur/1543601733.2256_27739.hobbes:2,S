Sounds like a configuration error. Make sure you configured your
kernel for a C3 (CONFIG_MCYRIXIII) or a P5MMX -- NOT a regular 686.
Same goes for user-space libraries etc: they MUST NOT be compiled
for a 686-class machine.
(VIA C3 pretends to be a 686 but does not implement the CMOV
conditional move instruction. In theory this is ok because CMOV
is officially optional, but gcc uses CMOV when compiling for
686 since every other known 686 has it.)
