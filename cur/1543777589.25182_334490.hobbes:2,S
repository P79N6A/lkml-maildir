I do agree with Francois regarding this issue:
AFAIR, there has been not one 2.6 kernel where this driver was available 
for SMP kernels. It's therefore untested which problems might arise with 
this driver on SMP systems. I'm not arguing against including this 
driver in 2.6.13, but 2.6.12.3 isn't the right place.
What surprises me most is that you accepted this patch is neither in 
2.6.13-rc3 nor in 2.6.13-rc3-mm1. There seems to be either an
(IMHO unfortunate) change in your policy of what patches to accept,
or there's a serious problem in your patch review process.
