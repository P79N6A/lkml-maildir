This was just discussed on l-k last week.  Basically, no it still doesn't
work (not for 2.2 at least).  The problem is with RAID doing buffer cache
snooping and causing data to be written out-of-order to disk (on 2.2).
This is fixed in 2.4, but there _may_ still be a problem in 2.4 when
rebuilding the array (on disk failure) in 2.4...  I'm not too sure of
the latter though...
Cheers, Andreas
