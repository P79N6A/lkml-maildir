  Yes, that's correct. All I need is the fork connector patch. It needs
more work like, as you said, sending an on/off message down the netlink
socket. I'm working on this (thank you very much Andrew for your
comments).
  I will run benchmarks found at 
http://bulk.fefe.de/scalability/
 to see
how the fork connector impacts on the kernel.
  All stuff that was previously done in kernel space and provided by the
2.6.8.1 ELSA patch has been moved in the ELSA user space daemon called
"jobd".
Best,
Guillaume
