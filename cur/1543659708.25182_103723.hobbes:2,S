Eric,
Success!
I've been carrying your kexec for 2.5.54 patch (and the hwfixes patch)
forward through subsequent kernels, and have had good luck (kexec works
fine for me) with them in 2.5.58 on my troublesome system (UP, P3-800,
640MB, Adaptec AIC7XXX SCSI).
I haven't had to change a thing with kexec.  For reference, the code I'm
currently using is downloadable from OSDL's patch-manager:
The "kexec-hwfixes" for to 2.5.58:

kexec patch for 2.5.58 (from the 2.5.54 version):
