I can still crash my x86_64 box with Christoph's program.
The meminfo in my case looks like this just before I execute the
program.

I was trying to bind the memory to node 0, which still has enough
free memory.
Not sure if this helps, but I have some more debug data.
While the kernel(2.6.16-rc1) oopes at page_alloc.c, line no: 556
(list_del(&page->lru), some of the variables in __rmqueue look like this at the time of crash:
page = 0xffffffffffffffd8
&page->lru = 0000000000000000
zone = 0xffff81000000e700
zone->name Normal
current_order 0
area->nr_free 0

Bharata.
