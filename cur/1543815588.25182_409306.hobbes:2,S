Yes, selective would be nice, but it's still massively unfair that is
required.  There is no criteria available for discrimination, so my
patches don't even try to classify, they only enforce the rules.  I
don't classify X as interactive, I merely provide a mechanism which
enables X to accumulate the cycles an interactive task needs to be able
to perform by actually _being_ interactive, by conforming to the
definition of sleep_avg.  Fortunately, it uses that mechanism.  I do
nothing more than trade stout rope for good behavior.  I anchor one end
to a boulder, the other to a task's neck.  The mechanism is agnostic.
The task determines whether it gets hung or not, and the user determines
how long the rope is.
