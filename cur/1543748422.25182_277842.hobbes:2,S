How does the driver supply the mapping if it does not know about the
"change"? Is it reserving or telling user space the hctl that will be
used?
If so, why can't the driver call scsi_add_device(h,c,t,l) after the ioctl
to create the logical drive completes?
Though I am all for using hotplug to initiate scanning from user space.
