Of course, see my suggestion for how to handle this in the post after the 
one you replied to.

At mount time and only if the volume supports compression. And they are 
ntfs global, i.e. not per mount point. That is still a big ram waste.

Sorry to disappoint you but my code is as efficient as possible while 
NR_CPUs is as ugly and inefficient as hell.

I hope I have managed to do that. (-:
