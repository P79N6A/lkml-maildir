Subject: Scsi cdrom naming confusion; sr or scd?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Documentation/devices.txt says:
 "The prefix /dev/sr (instead of /dev/scd) has been deprecated"
but booting 2.6.18.2 from a scsi CD only works if I pass the kernel
parameter root=/dev/sr0 and fails with root=/dev/scd0
I guess the kernel ought to be taught about the scd* names aswell?
