Hello, David!

Have you seen my .config file?
(Remember that it's all PATA I'm talking about, YMMV!)
I think it is
CONFIG_IDEDMA_PCI_AUTO=n
while
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
And I am using the
BLK_DEV_PDC202XX_NEW=y
One of the options there made it working...
It's pretty lame (<10MByte/sec) but thats
fine for now (just a test system).
The HDD is a a Maxtor DiamondMax 10, 120GB
(6B120P0), usually pretty fast.
Best greets,
