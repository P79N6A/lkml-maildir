Hi Christoph,
while it is true that BK will do the right thing if Linus applies this patch
and then you pull it, it's a lot nicer if you let him pull your tree.  
The problem is that you're going to have this in your tree as one delta and
Linus will have it in his tree as another delta.  When you pull, the data
will be in the tree twice.  That's not critical in this case, the amount of
data is relatively small, but it's still sort of messy.  While we can work
out that it is duplicate and make it so you don't have to merge it, it
increases the size of the revision history.  No big deal just this once,
but if everyone does this then we'll eventually get to a revision history
which is a lot less useful because of all the duplicates you have to wade
through to see why something was added.
