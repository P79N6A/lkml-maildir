Works fine with jiffy only resolution. sched_clock just returns the change 
when it happens. This leaves us with the accuracy of the previous code on 
hardware that doesn't give higher resolution time from sched_clock.

I don't see a problem.

As the comment says, the likelihood that both runqueues happen to be at the 
same priority_level is very low so the exact position cannot be transposed in 
my opinion. I'll see if I can simplify it though.

I don't see quite why that's a problem. If there's memory of the last dequeue 
and it enqueues at a different rotation it gets ignored. If it enqueues 
during the same rotation then that memory proves useful for ensuring it 
doesn't get a new full quota. Either way the array is always updated on 
enqueue so it wont be trying to add it to the wrong runlist.

I prefer to use the array value as a memory in case it wakes up on the same 
rotation and runqueue.
