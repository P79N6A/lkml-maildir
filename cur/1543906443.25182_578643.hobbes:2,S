whimper.
On a practical note, I'm still buried in convert-to-kzalloc patches, and
your proposal invites a two-year stream of 10,000 convert-to-alloc_struct
patches.
So if this goes in (and I can't say I'm terribly excited about the idea)
then I think we'd also need a maintainer who is going to handle all the
subsequent patches, run a git tree, (a quilt tree would be better, or maybe
a git tree with 100 branches), work with all the affected maintainers, make
sure there aren't clashes with other people's work and all that blah.
