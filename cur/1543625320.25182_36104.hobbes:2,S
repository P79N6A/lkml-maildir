Last one.
Don't bother checking for active pages in the swapout path.
Not sure about this one.  Clearly the page isn't *likely* to be on the
active list, because the caller found it on the inactive list.  But I
don't see any locking which would prevent the page from getting bumped
up to the active list in the meanwhile.
Needs more explanation.
