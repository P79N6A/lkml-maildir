"Brandon S. Allbery KF8NH" <allbery@kf8nh.apk.net>:
: "i386-redhat-linux", eh?  On S.u.S.E.?  Debian?  Stampede?  Pacific Hi-Tech? 
:  None of which are sufficiently different to require a different canonical 
: triplet.  So all of them would end up being identified as "redhat"... and I 
: fail to see how identifying other Linux distributions as Red Hat (or Red Hat 
: wannabees) differs from your complaint about "GNU/Linux".
His point, I think, was that i386-redhat-linux is quite a bit more
accurate and useful than i386-gnu-linux.  Ditto for i386-suse-linux
and i386-debian-linux.  For the other, smaller releases and/or for the
systems where it couldn't be figured out which distribution it was,
i386-gnu-linux or i386-unknown-linux, would be fine.
But to take {redhat,suse,slackware,debian} and call them all gnu is
(a) incorrect, (b) somewhat annoying, and (c) loses important information.
