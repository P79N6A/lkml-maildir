I'm been maintaining a couple (for now) out-of-tree filesystems for
UML, and have seen only minor updates needed over the course of 2.6.
Complaints about interface churn for filesystems (or anything else,
actually, since an architecture, such as UML, is exposed to nearly the
entire kernel) are imcomprehensible to me.
