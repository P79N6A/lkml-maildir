  Generally "do it all at one go" solutions don't scale, and sooner of
later break on a large case. It's a useful work-around, but likely to
bite. And the semiphore being locked for too long, such as a slow
machine and large list, is prebably not desirable either.
  Short of having an entry in a linked list (if I glanced at the code
correctly) include a synthetic position, I don't see any better
solution. Failing to see files is less of a problem, that seems possible
with any directory structure which reuses entries, but seeing the same
entry twice is not expected behaviour.

  His first management concern is not solving the problem, but covering
his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
