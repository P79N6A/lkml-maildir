Look at the code generated by this (by syscall0(int sync)): 
sync:
        movl $36,%eax
        int $0x80
        testl %eax,%eax
        jge .L3
        negl %eax
        movl %eax,errno
        movl $-1,%eax
        ret
Perform a syscall with __NR_sync in eax.  If the result is >=0 (success),
then return that value.  Else, set errno to -eax and return -1.
Other syscalls are similar, except some other values are loaded into
registers (up to 5 or 6 values -- not eax or esp, probably not ebp).
