Subject: [PATCH] link time error in drivers/mtd (240t13p2)

Hi.
Various files in drivers/mtd references cfi_probe (by way of do_cfi_probe).
This function is static and thus not shared. The following patch removes
the static declaration but if it is What Was Intended I do not know. It
makes the kernel link, however.

The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. I mean
in this century's history. But we all lived in this century. I didn't
live in this century.
