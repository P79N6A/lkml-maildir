It looks like all callers of these functions pass in milliseconds? Any
chance you can get rid of these two and use msleep_interruptible() and
msleep() instead? As long as you are not using these functions around
wait-queues, you are ok (which I think is the case here). If you are
using wait-queues with these sleeps, then please use
schedule_timeout_interruptible() and
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible() from the -mm tree.
Thanks,
Nish
