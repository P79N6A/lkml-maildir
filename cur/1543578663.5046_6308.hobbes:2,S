I'm only concerned about the semantics of fxsr and xmm in /proc/cpuinfo, _not_
about the kernel implementation and self contained #defines (that
I'd preferred if they really meant cpu_has and not can_I_use too, but
that's an our internal thing not visible from userspace).
fxsr and xmm in /proc/cpuinfo in 2.4.0, 2.4.1-pre[12], and 2.2.* means
"cpu_has" and _not_ "can_I_use".
So anybody using the fxsr and xmm in the "flags" row of /proc/cpuinfo as the
"can_I_use" will break in any kernel before 2.4.1-pre3.
Anybody reading fxsr and xmm as "cpu_has" will break in any kernel after
2.4.1-pre2.
This all I meant when I said that 2.4.1-pre3 broke /proc/cpuinfo.
I'd prefer if /proc/cpuinfo wasn't broken. That's all.
