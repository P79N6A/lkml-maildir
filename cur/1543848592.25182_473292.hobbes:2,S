Hmmm.. So Alan things a partially-outside-this-disk partition
shouldn't show up at all, and Andries thinks it should.
And both give reasonably believable justifications.
Maybe we need a kernel parameter?  How about this?

-----------------------------
Don't allow partitions to start or end beyond the end of the device.
Corrupt partitions tables can cause wierd partitions that confuse
programs.  This is confusion that can be avoided.
If a partition appears to start at or beyond the end of a device, we
don't enable it.
If it starts within the device but ends after the end, we clip it to 
fit within the device.
Not enabling partitions does not affect partition numbering of
subsequent partitions.
This change applies to partitions found by fs/partitions/check.c
and to partitions explicitly created via an ioctl.
There is no uniform agreement on whether partitions that extend
beyond the end of the device should be clipped or discarded.
Discarding is safer as it makes corruption less likely.
Clipping is more flexable and gives continued access to the partition.
So provide a kernel-parameter which a 'safe' default.
   partitions=strict
is the default
   partitions=relaxed
means that partitions are clipped rather than rejected.
This kernel parameters only applies to auto-detected partitions,
not those set by ioctl.
