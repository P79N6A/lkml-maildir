Yeah, I know how you stand on that. I just wanted to post all this
before going off into the woods reworking it all.

Is planned. What do you think of the proposed a_ops extension to
accomplish this? That is,
->swapfile() - is this address space willing to back swap
->swapout() - write out a page
->swapin() - read in a page

Trouble with that part is that we don't have any sane network block
devices atm, NBD is utter crap, and iSCSI is too complex to be called
sane.
Maybe Evgeniy's Distributed storage thingy would work, will have a look
at that.

Sure, concrete suggestion are always welcome. Just being told something
is utter crap only goes so far.
