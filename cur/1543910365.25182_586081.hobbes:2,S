I am looking at current source, built with current (non-experimental) GCC
from Fedora Core 7. If I dissassemble ether_setup, which is
void ether_setup(struct net_device *dev)
{
...
	memset(dev->broadcast, 0xFF, ETH_ALEN);
}
I see a tail recursion (jmp) to memset which is the code in arch/x86_64/lib/memset.S
