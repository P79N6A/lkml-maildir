Yep, I told Patrick about this last week sometime. The problem is
that only later Intels (from P4 onwards iirc) have the
name string cpuid function. Without which we need a table to
do the family/model/stepping translation to name strings.
It's not that much work (and most of it already exists in the
kernels before the per-cpu split up).
