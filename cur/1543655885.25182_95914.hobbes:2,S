Oh come on, it's far less disingenuous than what you said:

I'm sure you'll continue making snide comments on every mailing list you 
maintain, but the fact remains:
I would much rather accept a fix from you.
That hasn't changed in the past year.  or two.  or any amount of time. 
Your input is very valuable, and I typically save quite a few of your 
emails.

While I disagree with this assessment, I think we can safely draw the 
conclusion that the problem is _not_ people ignoring your patches, or 
preferring other patches over yours.

I don't recall _ever_ getting a patch from you or seeing one posted on 
lkml or netdev.  How can you be ignored if you're not sending patches?

s/was/is/
I take responsibility for fixing it, I just haven't fixed it yet :)

We're slowly getting there, in terms of regression and stress testing.
Since you don't send patches anymore for a long time, I was really the 
only one [stupid enough?] to stand up and even bother to help collecting 
and reviewing net driver changes.
I would love to integrate your drivers directly, but they don't come 
anywhere close to using current kernel APIs.  The biggie of biggies is 
not using the pci_driver API.  So, given that we cannot directly merge 
your drivers, and you don't send patches to kernel developers, what is 
the next best alternative?  (a) let kernel net drivers bitrot, or (b) 
maintain them as best we can without Don Becker patches?  I say that "b" 
is far better than "a" for Linux users.
