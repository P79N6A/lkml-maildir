I know there's open coded walks outside the tree (I maintain one) due to 
there being no suitable function available from with in it...
I needed something like:
pte_t *va_to_ptep_map(struct mm_struct *mm, unsigned int addr)
There was code in follow_page() that did basically what I needed, but it 
was all contained within that function so I had to re-implement it.
