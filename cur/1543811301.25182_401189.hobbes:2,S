Any chance we could get 'git fetch --heads' ?
FWIW, I regularly blow away and create new heads, so the above is rather 
long for people who use my repos.  A lot of them use rsync because when 
you're tracking a repo with ever-changing branches, 'git pull' doesn't 
really approximate "make local X look like remote X".
