Look on 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.4/
you'll find at the end 2.4.27-rc3-libata1.patch.
Please do send feedback to Jeff, he asked for some a few days ago and
unfortunately I don't have the machine to test anymore. I don't know if
others reported successs stories.
Cheers,
Willy
