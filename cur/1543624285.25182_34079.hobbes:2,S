I have no argument with basic command validation.  But take a
look at ide_cmd_type_parser(), for example.  Do we really need a
giant switch statement listing all the allowed commands, just so
we can throw back a IDE_DRIVE_TASK_INVALID to user-space if they
decide to send down some undocumeted firmware wiping commands?
Especially since that giant struct of allowed commands is
duplicated in ide_pre_handler_parser() and ide_handler_parser()
