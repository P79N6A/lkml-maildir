I asked this same question with U320 scsi controller.  I noticed my CPU went
to 100%.  It never really was being used at all, just in wait.  Run top to
see if "wa" is high or not.
This is what I see (no load, no disk activity) for the CPU:
Cpu(s):  0.1% us,  0.1% sy,  0.0% ni, 97.6% id,  2.2% wa,  0.0% hi,  0.1% si
Copying a single disk to /dev/null (9.1gb):
Cpu(s):  0.0% us,  1.7% sy,  0.0% ni, 74.8% id, 23.3% wa,  0.0% hi,  0.2% si
