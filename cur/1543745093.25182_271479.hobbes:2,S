Are you sure /dev/console exists when the kernel boots?
(It is thy duty to ask this...)
I wonder, because there is no configurator (menuconfig) option to en-/disable
the driver for /dev/console -- it's *always* in. In 2.6.8, and I have not seen
any changes to drivers/char/tty_io.c:tty_init() - where it is added - in
further kernels yet.
>My kernel configuration includes the following:

>CONFIG_LEGACY_PTY_COUNT=256
Initial console has nothing to do with ptys.
The console driver will always be compiled in, it is not wrapped into any
#if..#endif in drivers/char/tty_io.c.
But to be on the safe side, enable:
CONFIG_VT=y
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y

The one that takes a program is init=, but that will probably also not work
because you ain't got no console.
As I read from kernel/printk.c, the console= parameter seems to set up a
-serial line-, also see Documentation/serial-console.txt and
kernel-parameters.txt.

How, after all, did you run into this error? Directly after upgrading (if
applicable)?
