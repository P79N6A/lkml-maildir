Linus, Andrew,
The following serie of 6 patches updates the EISA support to its
latest version.
Summary :
- Now reserves I/O ranges according to EISA specs (four 256 bytes
regions instead of a single 4KB region).
- By default, do not try to probe the bus if the mainboard does not
seems to support EISA (allow this behaviour to be changed through a
command-line option).
- Use parent bridge device dma_mask as default for each discovered
device.
- Allow devices to be enabled or disabled from the kernel command line
(usefull for non-x86 platforms where the firmware simply disable
devices it doesn't know about...).
- Probe the right number of EISA slots on PA-RISC. No more, no less.
The whole thing have been tested on x86, Alpha and PA-RISC.
Please apply.
