If you  were documenting  yourself a bit  instead of  trolling, you'll
notice that's the GNU Hurd is not based on Mach. The GNU Hurd tries to
be micro-kernel independant, and will be ported to other microkernels,
like L4 Version 4.
And  if you  look a  bit  in the  history, you'll  notice that  second
generation  micro-kernels  (like  L4)  were  not  available,  or  even
designed, at the time Mach was chosen as the first microkernel to make
the Hurd runs on.
