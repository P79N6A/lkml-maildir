At this point in time, in the stable kernel series, I say no.
That is why I created the class_simple interface, which allows
developers to be able to export data through sysfs (like the dev_t
data), without having to change their lifetime rules at all.
Now when 2.7 starts up again, that's the proper time to be changing this
kind of stuff to work "properly".  Until then, lets just live with the
lifetime rules that we have (if they work, and almost all of them seem
to).
And remember, I'm the person who really _wants_ to see all of this stuff
fixed up properly...

See the class_simple code for an example of how this can be done.  It's
not a sysfs issue.  It's an issue of how you _use_ sysfs :)
