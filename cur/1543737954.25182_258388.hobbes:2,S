Alas, this does not eliminate the 30-second delay on my box.
Just to re-emphasize, I feel a particularly relevant detail is that my 
VIA-based Athlon64 box has _all_ PATA ports disabled.
I am fairly certainly that the delay did not exist when I enabled at 
least one PATA port, and I can verify this if you would like.
