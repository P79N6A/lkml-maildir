Subject: 2.6.17-rc5-git1: regression: resume from suspend(RAM) fails: libata issue

My ata_piix based Notebook (Dell i9300) suspends/resumes perfectly (RAM or disk)
with 2.6.16.xx kernels, but fails resume on 2.6.17-rc5-git1 (the first 2.6.17-*
I've attempted on this machine).
On resume from RAM, after a 30-second-ish timeout, the screen comes on
but the hard disk is NOT accessible.  "dmesg" in an already-open window
shows this (typed in from handwritten notes):
sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x40000
end_request: I/O error, /dev/sda, sector nnnnnnn
sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x40000
end_request: I/O error, /dev/sda, sector nnnnnnn
sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x40000
end_request: I/O error, /dev/sda, sector nnnnnnn
sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x40000
end_request: I/O error, /dev/sda, sector nnnnnnn
sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x40000
end_request: I/O error, /dev/sda, sector nnnnnnn
sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x40000
end_request: I/O error, /dev/sda, sector nnnnnnn
sd 0:0:0:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x40000
end_request: I/O error, /dev/sda, sector nnnnnnn
(the nnnnnnn was actually a real number, different on each message).
Is there a fix already floating around for this?
Cheers
