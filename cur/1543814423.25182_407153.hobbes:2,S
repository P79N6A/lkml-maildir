Is not! :). This is the very reason why I think it is pointless churn.
There are plenty of functions (even static, confined to a single file,
or ones much more complex than this) which could unquestionably have
their names changed for the better.
This change doesn't even add anything except a redundant element so
it is even questionable that it makes the name better at all.
But I know you've got your heart set on them now so I won't continue
with the impossible task of talking you out of them ;) Just don't
expect that people will suddenly start getting hotplug-cpu races
right, overnight.
