I don't know what kernel SuSE 6.1 ships with, but presumably it's a recent
2.2.x.
There is an outstanding problem with the Zip driver and Asus motherboards
in EPP+ECP mode.  If your BIOS menu offers other modes for your parallel
port, it's worth trying them out.
Another thing that's worth checking is that parport is actually providing
ports for ppa to use.  Both the parport and parport_pc modules should be
loaded, and /proc/parport/ should give you information about the ports
that it's using.
