Please - is it really necessary that application writers are offended in
this way? Timo is investing enormous time and effort in writing a *good*
application, and he's effectively seeking a way to *robustly* deal with
Maildir format mail storage. Please leave it at "readdir/getdents don't
work the way you expect and cannot for this and that reason."
Timo tries to implement a *robust* Maildir reader and has just bumped
into the flaws of DJB's "no-locking" store.
Yes, it's a mail server again that poses file system questions on this
list; only it's IMAP this time rather than SMTP and directory
synchronous I/O...

I'd like to question that.
Just some rough thoughts:
1. the number of open file handles (including directories seen as files
   for a moment at least) is limited per process, and I'd think the
   number of directories open can be lower
2. versioned information might provide what the application wants
   without locking up the system
3. the application could be offered an interface for atomic directory
   reads that requires the application to provide sufficient memory in a
   single contiguous buffer (making it thread-safe in the same go).
