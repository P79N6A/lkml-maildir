I still don't think it's a good idea to add a pointer to struct page for this.
This means any kernel that enables the config would need to carry this significant
overhead, no matter if containers are used to not.
Better would be to store them in some other data structure that is only
allocated on demand or figure out a way to store them in the sometimes
not all used fields in struct page.
BTW your patchkit seems to be also in wrong order in that when 02 is applied
it won't compile.
