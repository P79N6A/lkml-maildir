Hello Jörg,
i must agree here that getting cdrecord/cdrtools-2.0x going on the latest
SuSE 9.x editions has been extremely tiresome. Can it not be the case that
this has something todo with SuSE's inheritance to the UnitedLinux project?
I would like to suggest and kindly propose to maybe start cooperating
with Warly from MandrakeSoft. I think he has done a fine job sofar
in the latest Mandrake editions, 9.2 and 10.0 , making your cdrtools-2.0x
software run like it should. Warly is even by you mentioned as the only
one not violating your GPL licensed cdrtools package.
His efforts to get DVD burning rolling can be found at :

thanks,
best regards,
Robert
