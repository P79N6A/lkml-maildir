Ahh we are going to implement STREAMS of some kind in kernel then...

Yes! Ever looked at the terminfo record for the sun console
terminal. I think the current linux tty driver does already
far too much in the kernel itself.
The rest should be handled by a pty user land programm.
(Basically I think this should all be done as an extension to the
GNU screen programm.)
I'm even considering the VT switching stuff in kernel
as inherently bad design. Do you remember how much grief this
is all causing since even the beginning of Linux. 
Races races races! Security security security!
And Yes I don't care that much about console speed. There is just
a *human* limit to this and most of the currently interactively
used computers are already sufficiently fast in any case.
Thus a clean design over ultimate speed optimization
seems to be well justifyed to me.
The current linux console does scroll already in a speed which
doesn't give me even a chance to get a grasp what's passing by.
I don't consider this as a feature... (Oh FB based console seems to be 
much better with respect to this problem :-).
