Oleg sent only the changesets on the resend, since he figured that 
everyone but Linus would have applied it after the first send, and they 
could look through the archives if not.  I sort of suspected that was 
too logical to be true.;-) We'll send the full patch in the future.  I 
don't really like the idea of doing anything in a way that makes people 
feel disadvantaged unless they use bk.  Oleg, send Jeff the patch.
