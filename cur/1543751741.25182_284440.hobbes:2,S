Subject: Patch 2/3: Reduce number of get_cmos_time_calls.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/8/122

Change sleep_start from signed to unsigned long. This appears to address
an issue with the clock being occasionally off by around 1 hr 10
minutes.
