You might want to implement shutdown(). Thread #1 will call shutdown() 
instead of
the close(). Your shutdown() implementation can do something like:
         sk->shutdown |= RCV_SHUTDOWN;
         sk->state_change(sk);
So, reader will wakeup, check shutdown mask and return error because socket was
shut down.
