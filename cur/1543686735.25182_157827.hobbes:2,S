Yea, I don't think this is the issue. RH9 doesn't have this problem. I
was just explaining why I asked if ntpdate -b <server> set the time
properly on his box.
Really I think the amd76x_pm module is cause, as it seems to changes the
cpu frequency and I'm suspecting it doesn't use the cpu_freq notifiers.
I'd be quite interested to see if the issue still appears when you're
not running that module. 
thanks
