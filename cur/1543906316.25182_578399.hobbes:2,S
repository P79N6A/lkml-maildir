Looks right, but after reading Andrew's opinion about select I'd be
astonished if he doesn't know this problem already.

Is there a new one or do you suggest possibility of abusing the
authority of the netpoll's author with such trifles...?!
BTW, I can't find any official meaning of def_bool, but it's name
suggests only default value, so logically it should be not enough
to assure NET_POLL_CONTROLLER=y, and netpoll should use "depends",
"require" or "select" (IMHO more readable too), but on the other
hand this could be practially wrong...

There are some notions about "other diagnostic tools" in some
net drivers, eg. 3c509.c, so there would be a little bit of
work if, after changing this, they really exist (and even if
not - maybe it's reasonable to save such possibility for the
future?).
