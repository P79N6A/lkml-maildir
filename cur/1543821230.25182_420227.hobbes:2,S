Linus merges dozens of git trees, and we have exactly zero process for 
noticing issues like [1]. Sure, you can say "Adrian will complain", but 
others can complain equally when I unexport a symbol where I either 
missed the in-kernel users or an in-kernel user is just about to be 
submitted.
And where is a non-minor problem with unexports?
If it accidentially breaks in-kernel stuff people notice immediately, 
and if it breaks external modules there is still the point that we do 
not have a stable API for external modules.
And breaking external modules frequently is a _good_ thing since it 
gives people them a reason for submitting their code for inclusion into 
the kernel. LSM/AppArmor is an example for the benefits of threating 
with immediate removal (no matter whether the result will be merging 
AppArmor or a more secure implementation of AppArmor, or whatever else).
