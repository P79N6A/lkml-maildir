And your system actually boots?  I get screenfuls of similar messages but the
machine locks solid.  If I try to turn off acpi then it gets a little further
(although the orinico module causes a bunch of them) but then it locks solid
a few seconds after allowing me to log in.  I had to switch back to an earlier
version to get anything done
