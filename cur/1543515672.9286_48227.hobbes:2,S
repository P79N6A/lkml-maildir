Spinlocks are NOP on uniprocessor.

Yes. Think hard about deadlocks.
Well - when I was about to do something like this (block device in
userland), I called it network block device. Loopback network is quite
nice to use.

What's that? Some kind of distributed system? I WANT THAT!
I have two machines, and would like to use them both for kernel
compiles. Bitcluster has some serious problems :-( and mj's slice is
2.2. only and I was unable to port it.
