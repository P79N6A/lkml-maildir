eepro100 seems to be SMP safe, so it shouldn't be there.
Have anyone else used eepro100 with preempt-realtime?
Anyway: I miss stack trace from the bugs. I don't know what to swich on at 
arm to get it to work - I think I remember getting stack traces years ago 
when I succeed in getting Linux 2.4 to run on a custom SA1110 based board. 
Try to swich on various debug like
  CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO
  CONFIG_UNWIND_INFO
  CONFIG_BUGVERBOSE
  CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
