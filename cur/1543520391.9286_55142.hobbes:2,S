But not all the world is intel -- there is FP emulation code for Alpha,
ARM, MIPS, m68k, PPC and Sparc in the tree.  However, I seem to remember
someone analysing the FP emulator (on ARM) and concluding that the
cost of emulating FP instructions was dominated by the trap handler
and instruction decode.  So there's not much point in replacing the
algorithms with more efficient algorithms when it's not going to make
much difference.
