I simply heard the effect was less visible on PIII than on more recent
cpus, but maybe that was wrong. Do you have any result comparing
different cpus (I mean with realistic tests not stuff like loop_print.c
doing nothing but rdtsc)? It'd be most interesting to see the effect on
hugetlbfs, to get past a certain amount of ram hugetlbfs is needed for
performance reasons (plus it avoids the costs of the pte saving ram, but
that's a secondary benefit, ptes are in highmem anyways).
