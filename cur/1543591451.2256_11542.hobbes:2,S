If I understand you right, the plan is to leave tty_open unchanged (it calls
driver close on failed driver open) and try to fix ldisc and serial driver
races as much as possible.  Correct?
Where is an example of the "other locking fix styles" that you and Ted want
to apply to the serial drivers?

Leaving tty_open unchanged does have compatibility going for it.

I would be interested to try to figure this out and fix it--can you give
me more of an idea of what the problem is?
