The above is not a proper changelog, please ammend it, and write it in
the form found in Paolo's STL email.

	if ((!A || B) && C)
           {
             //
           }
         else

                 if (A) __w->_M_left->_M_color = _M_black;
                 //
               }
             //
           }
Therefore, the check for A (_w->_M_left, that is) in the innermost if
is definitely redundant. "
But add the extra redundant case in our code.
Then resend, and you can add
