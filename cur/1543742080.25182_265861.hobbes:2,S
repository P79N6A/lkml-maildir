I am seeing this with Mozilla in an Xnest session.  Even after I terminate
Mozilla + Xnest there is a huge amount of swapped-out memory (~100MB).  This
is on a system with 320MB of memory.  Since the problem goes away when I
leave X I had assumed it was an X bug (Fedora Core 1, not up-to-date) but
now I wonder...  Kernel version is 2.6.9 + patches from L-K but problem is
the same in base 2.6.9.
