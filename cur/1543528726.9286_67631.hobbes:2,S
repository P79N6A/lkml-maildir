	On those vector CRAYs there is a requirement that your
	memory usage won't exceed the available main memory.
	That is, it isn't any sort of VIRTUAL MEMORY beast.
	(And while your vector performance is tens or hundreds
	 of gigaflops, you don't want to wait for pageing to
	 mess around for 5-20 milliseconds for your precious
	 data page -- not that vector subsystem state is so
	 easily storable/restartable at bus-address fault either...)
	On CRAYs the king of the design are those vector gigaflops.
	*Everything* else is scrapped if it isn't helping there.
	( -> address fault during vector execution kills the instruction
	  without a change for restart. )
