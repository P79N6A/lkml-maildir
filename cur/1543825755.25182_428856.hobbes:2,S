As I mentioned before, please keep these defaults as a -mm-only patch, 
Giving them testing in -mm is fine, but defaults are already way too much 
abused as is. The default rule should be to enable an option explicitly, 
if it's needed, it should not be auto-enabled, because its author likes 
it so much. Using a "default y" should be close to hiding the option via 
CONFIG_EMBEDDED or some other option and the default should not differ 
between hidden and visible state, e.g.:
config FOO
	bool "foo" if BAR
	default y
bye, Roman
