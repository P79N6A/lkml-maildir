yeah. The whole trace_preempt_enter_idle() thing looks a bit suspect. 
Why cannot those architectures simply disable/enable preemption and get 
the same effect? It's not like we ever want to allow the preemption of 
the idle task.
and once that is solved, irqs_off_preempt_count() can again include the 
hardirq and preempt count check only and doesnt have to check the 
idle_cpu flag. This would make the whole thing simpler and would avoid 
silly bugs like this.
