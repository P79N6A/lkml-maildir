Well, citing from the ACPI 2.0 specification, section 9.1.6 Transitioning from
the Working to the Sleeping State (which is what we're discussing here):
3. OSPM places all device drivers into their respective Dx state. If the device
   is enabled for wake, it enters the Dx state associated with the wake
   capability. If the device is not enabled to wake the system, it enters the
   D3 state.
4. OSPM executes the _PTS control method, passing an argument that indicates
   the desired sleeping state (1, 2, 3, or 4 representing S1, S2, S3, and S4).
My opinion is that we should follow this part of the specification and so we do.

You're wrong, sorry.
