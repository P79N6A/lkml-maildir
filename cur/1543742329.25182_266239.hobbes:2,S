Well, you are quite right - Linux is aimed at never breaking existing 
binaries, and ptrace() does not follow that.
However, the problem here is that UML was not behaving correctly. Instead of 
using the documented way, PTRACE_KILL, we just sent a SIGKILL and that 
happened to work (and since PTRACE_KILL implementation just sends a SIGKILL, 
you would still expect it to work).
In fact, I fixed the Gerd Knorr test program to use PTRACE_KILL and it works 
on 2.6.9.

Thanks a lot for that, it's something very important for me, but I'm not the 
only one deserving such recognition. See the amount of work done by Bodo 
Stroesser in a few weeks - he solved lots of problems which I fought against 
without success.
Besides that, I need to do a lot of janitorial work, while holding on more 
advanced stuff - so I think that anybody could be able to help here.
