Subject: [PATCH] Warn people that ipchains and ipfwadm are going away.

Name: Warn that ipchains and ipfwadm are going away
Status: Trivial
Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
At the recent netfilter workshop in Erlangen, we was decided to remove
the backwards compatibility code for ipchains and ipfwadm.  This will
allow significant cleanup of interfaces, since we had to have a
mid-level interface for the backwards compatibility layer to use.
Start off with a warning for 2.6.9, so any remaining users have a
chance to migrate.  Their firewall scripts might not check return
values, and they might get a nasty surprise when this goes away.
