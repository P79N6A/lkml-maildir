Yes, exactly that.  The streams are created on demand of course, and
by userspace helpers when that's appropriate which I suspect it almost
always is.

Yes.  Hence the idea of coherent views between two files: writing to
one affects the content of the other, although the calcalation is only
done on demand (or when the fs wants to migrate the representation --
for example, creating the flat container prior to deleting the
regeneratable pieces in order to save space).
I haven't seen anything from Namesys that says they'll do that.  I
have the impression the streams are just generated in memory on the
fly, not stored on disk with a cacheing policy, but that's just an
impression.  (We've all seen the Namesys white papers, they're not
_that_ revealing). :)
I'm just pointing out how to do it _right_.  I think it will turn out
like this eventually, either next year or some time over the next
decade after some iterations.  Inevitable.  Mark my words, etc. :)
