Of course that's what it should mean, but obviously the folks
who packaged it were not too up on things.  And, let's face
the music here, if we as group of supposedly smart people
can't come close to reaching any consensus, can we blame
marketing folks for mislabeling something???

Sorry, I was feeling frustrated and should've kept that internal.

But the fact is that I've presented what I think are good arguments
on how to "fix" things in a rational and _consistant_ manner.  
That is the point of metrics after all, to have a simple, rational,
and consistant set of units of measurement to replace the
inconsistant units that were previously used.   If we can't do
this, then there is no point in converting.   Americans are right
to continue using English/America/Imperial units if even the
so called cognescenti can't get metrics right.
