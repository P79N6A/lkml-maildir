FWIW I experienced this with a RH-5.2 (+ updates) & kernel 2.2.{1,2-pre2}
(SMP,monolithic,all-SCSI,3c905,IP-aliasing) client to SunSITE UK which I
guess isn't running Linux nfsd ;)

Quite. I tried to copy an 18MB file to /tmp, and NFS stuck at around 17:
bad news when your homes are over NFS!

Hmm.. I couldn't umount; maybe I hadn't used "-o intr" then. However,
I resorted to samba-mounting SunSITE instead, which just about worked,
until my NFS "-o hard,intr,nolock" home mounts keeled over again :(
I don't want to return to 2.0; that would mean too many recompiles and
worse SMP. So, if anyone can think of any tests I can run, I should be
able to find the time to do it.
