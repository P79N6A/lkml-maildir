Subject: [PATCH] printk simultaneous oops disentangling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
Here's a patch to stop multiple simultaneous oopses on an SMP system from
interleaving with and overwriting bits of each other. It only permits lock
breaking if the printk lock is held by the same CPU.
