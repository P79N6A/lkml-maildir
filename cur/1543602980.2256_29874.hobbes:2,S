... whereas with SMTP, syslog, printer (lpd) etc, it's the other way
around. Some servers are primarily "sources", while others are
primarily "sinks". Sources are more common, and most users are
probably more familiar with sources than sinks.

But not for for X, NAS, ident ...
Local is a relative term. Presumably you meant local relative to a
user.
There are all kinds of generalisations one could make about individual
protocols, none of which are ultimately relevant to the client/server
distinction.
As Ingo points out, although it could have been more clear, the actual
distinction between client and server is that the client initiates the
communication, while the server responds (cf "originate" and "answer"
in telephone terminology).
