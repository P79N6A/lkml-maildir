It seems to me that gcc wasn't ever subjected to such a draconian clean
code directive as the kernel... and AFAIKS egcs has done a _lot_ of
cleanup. More is to come, to be sure.
Both are very complex pieces of code, but the root of their complexities is
very different. But in the end both stem from solving very complex
problems, just different ones.
