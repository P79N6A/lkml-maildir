ok, perhaps I've misunderstood the meaning of IORESOURCE_IO and
IORESOURCE_MEM. Is IORESOURCE_IO for "outb" and "inb" (Intel assembler,
don't know the Arm aquivalent)? Then you are right, it should be
IORESOURCE_MEM, only, because anything is accessed as like accessing normal
memory. I didn't found much documention of such low-level kernel
programming.

ok, thanks. If you have a new patch, I'll try it on my platform.

perhaps you are right, I don't understand the interactions between the
driver and the USB framework in detail.

The platform was developed by a company I'm working for as a freelancer for
a product the company sells.

do you mean sl811->board->reset? I don't know, where I have to setup the
function pointer, but looks ok for me to reset the controller (and all
plugged USB devices) in the probe function.
