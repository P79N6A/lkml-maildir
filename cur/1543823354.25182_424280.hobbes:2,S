I gave a try at the latest ata patches announced yesterday by Jeff and
it completelly solved my SATA ATAPI bug.. I even been able to burn my
first DVD using my Plextor 716SA on my Linux!!!  Really nice and much
anticipated work!  Thnx a lot!
I have already marked bug 5533 as resolved and I'll wait until inclusion
into 2.6.18 to close it.  I've also marked bug 6317 has closed since
that did not occur since around rc2 or rc3 of 2.6.17.
I also ran a memtest86+ all night to make sure there where no problems
with my memory... And everything is fine so no problems there.

Wow.. This exactly resume all my other BUGS I have... And they where
quite hard to find actually... Thnx for the info.  I'll disable
irqbalance tonight for sure until there is a final fix into the kernel.

Thnx.. Would be really appreciated... And just ask if you need a tester!
