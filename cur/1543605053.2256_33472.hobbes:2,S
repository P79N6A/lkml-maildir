I thought this was some bug in some chipset I use, and enabled 
* chipset bugfix/support
options in my .config
****
[*]   CMD640 chipset bugfix/support
[*]   CMD640 enhanced support
[*]   RZ1000 chipset bugfix/support
[*]   Generic PCI IDE chipset support
[*]   Sharing PCI IDE interrupts support
[*]   Generic PCI bus-master DMA support
****
And I could boot.
I'm no expert, so if this information helps, good.
