Something of interest on this, maybe:
Here is the (pertinent) log of the system booting:
Aug 29 09:32:50 daffy kernel: requesting new irq thread for IRQ1...
Aug 29 09:32:50 daffy kernel: atkbd.c: Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio1. 
Some program, like XFree86, might be trying access hardware directly.
Aug 29 09:32:50 daffy kernel: md: md driver 0.90.0 MAX_MD_DEVS=256, 
MD_SB_DISKS=27
Aug 29 09:32:50 daffy kernel: IRQ#1 thread started up.
And some further entries:
Aug 29 16:48:50 daffy kernel: atkbd.c: Spurious NAK on isa0060/serio1. 
Some program, like XFree86, might be trying access hardware directly.
Aug 29 16:48:50 daffy kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (raw set 2, 
code 0x0 on isa0060/serio1).
Aug 29 16:48:50 daffy kernel: atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes 00 <keycode>' to 
make it known.
Aug 29 16:48:50 daffy kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed (raw set 2, 
code 0x18 on isa0060/serio1).
Aug 29 16:48:50 daffy kernel: atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes 18 <keycode>' to 
make it known.
I get the "Unknown key pressed" and "Use 'setkeycodes" messages whenever 
I press a key on the keyboard. I don't see very many of the "Spurious 
NAK" messages though.
