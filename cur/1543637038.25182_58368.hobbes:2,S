okay, agreed.

i've added this one as well:
	local_save_flags(flags)		- save
a fair number of places want (and need) to use __save_flags(flags)-type of
functionality, without the irq-disabling side-effect.
But also, a number of places now do:
	local_save_flags(flags);
	local_irq_disable();
which should be:
	local_irq_save(flags);
(these places will be simplified in an upcoming patch.)
The new __cli/__sti cleanup patch is at:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/remove-irqlock-patches/cli-sti-cleanup-2.5.27-B2
compiles, boots & works just fine on x86 UP and SMP.
