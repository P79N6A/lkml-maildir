I'll move it to kernel/immediate.c. We can therefore remove the powerpc
immediate.c as well.

Nope, that could lead to problems. I call core_immediate_update()
_very_ early, before boot_cpu_init() is called. Therefore,
cpu_online_map is not set yet. I am not sure the benefit of using
num_online_cpus outweights the added fragility wrt other boot process
initializations.

Thanks. Many thanks for the review, I'll repost the patchset for
comments.
