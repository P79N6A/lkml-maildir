That is true, but in a difference sense.  The correct way is to use
the major/minor/makedev functions.  No need to poke into the kernel
headers.

Wrong.  None of these programs rely in any way on a particular structure
of dev_t.  They use the major/minor accessor function and the makedev
contructor function.  How the values are encoded in dev_t values is
completely opaque to them.
