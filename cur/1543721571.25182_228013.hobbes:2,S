Hello everybody,
Is there a general concensus that the one-liner in 2.6.7 is an
appropriate fix for the FPU hang/crash bug?  I have several machines
running 2.4.x which require that outside people have shell access.
Needless to say, I'm somewhat nervous about this problem =)
I'm trying to find a nice balance between potential downtime due to 
malicious users and loss of functionality/b0rkedness due to unforeseen
bugs in quick fixes.  I've seen at least three different solutions to 
this problem; two of them have confirmed negative side-effects.  Noone
seems to have complained about the one-liner.  Does anyone foresee 
problems here, or should this be the correct fix (it seems right to me,
but my CPU-level voodoo is weak).
Thanks in advance,
