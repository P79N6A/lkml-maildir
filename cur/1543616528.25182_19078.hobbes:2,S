Thanks to Andrea !! 
How about adding a flag in blk_dev structure. (I currently couldn't find one).
Set the flag for the drivers which support multiple bufferhead sizes in
a single IO request and use this flag to do RAW VARY or not.
Does this address everyones concerns ? I am willing to work with the
drivers I tested/reviewed/verified to make the change to set the flag.
As driver owners verify their drivers, could set the flag (in future).
If everyone is okay with this approach, I can make a new patch for this.
Thanks,
Badari
