Not entirely, no.  This discussion is touching on the reasons for
people (ie: manpower) being here.  Also on toolchain suitability
and release practices, etc.  Also upon how bk and non-bk developers
interwork.  That's not a bad thing.

Oh I'm sure bitkeeper is excellent.
When you use the term "license religion", you are in fact saying "If
someone has philosophical objections then those people are irrational
zealots and their objections and philosophical beliefs are baseless".
That's not very respectful...
> Seriously, what is your problem with BK?  What do you feel that you lose?
I've said about, uh, three times now that I'm not losing anything.
Problem?  Well partly I just can't be assed to use the thing because
I'm comfortable with my own scripts and all revision control systems
just get in your face and suck.  But also because I'm here to improve
the body of public software, and at the end of the day, any support
which I put into bitkeeper won't help there.  (using == supporting).
So.  Summary: keep the prepatches rolling.  And lighten up on the
perjoratives - they are unbecoming.
