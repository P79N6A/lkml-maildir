The whole thing could be considered an "allmodconfig" bug. In this case,
"select" is working as expected on IA64 and automatically sets
IA64_UNCACHED_ALLOCATOR when MSPEC is selected.
Perhaps the right fix would be modifying allmodconfig so that it takes
into account dependecies (i.e. "depends on", "select", etc).
