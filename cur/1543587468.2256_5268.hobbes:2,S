It makes more sense to start migrating drivers to macros such as
msec_to_jiffies(), msec_to_whatever_add_timer_wants(), etc.  (Names
changed to protect the innocent.)  And leave HZ approximately the
way it is, because that's what the code expects.
A good transition is for add_timer() to be defined as
  #define add_timer(a) add_timer_ns(a*1000000000/HZ)
although this causes problems with timers over 4 seconds.  As much
as I like nanoseconds, it's probably overkill here, since one should
be requesting absolute time if it's specified in nanoseconds.
