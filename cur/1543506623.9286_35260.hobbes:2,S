I have two questions regarding this statement
1) Why do you think the kernel does not know which IP address is associated
with which network device?  This information is obviously available.
2) Why would you want to respond to ARP requests received on a device that
does not have an IP address configured?
As to the responses that having multiple interfaces on a single broadcast
domain is an illegal configuration, it sounds like several other people are
interested in using such a setup as well.
Note: I'm not advocating breaking proxy ARP, this seems to be special cased
anyway and would continue to be so.
