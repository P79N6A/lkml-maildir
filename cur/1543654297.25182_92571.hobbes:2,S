Subject: [PATCH] ressurection of VISWS support in 2.5-ac

Hi all,
after about month of heavy nightly work :)) ,
I'm proud to present updated VISWS support for 2.5.xx kernels.
Attached patch is against 2.5.49-ac1, but can be applied to 2.5.47-ac
with small tweaking in Kconfig. 2.5.47-ac is even preferrable for people 
who don't want to bother with modules mess^H^H^H^Hproblems in newer kernels.
This kernel loads and works fine in my VISWS 320 with serial console or
via ssh connection.
Problems that still remains:
	- why elf kernel image entry point address points to rest_init() ?
	  Loader cludge required to fix this issue, loader tarball attached.
	- console doesn't show anything, while /dev/fb0 works fine;
	- 'modprobe parport_pc' causes hang, need to imvestigate irq probing;
	- SMP support completely untested;
Alan, can you apply this patch to 2.5.49-ac or it should be splitted to 
smaller per-area patches ?
Best regards.
