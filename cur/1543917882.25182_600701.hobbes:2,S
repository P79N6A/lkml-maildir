No, it boot and work normally. The only thing i bother, is the
additional 260 timer interrupts per seconds.
Here is short result:
c1e enabled:
  -- power consumption about 23 watts
  -- there is only C1 power state enabled
  -- there are about 260 timer interrupts per seconds
tested with  x86_64(2.6.22, 2.6.23-rc8, 2.6.23-rc8-hrt1 ),
i386(2.6.21, 2.6.22, 2.6.23-rc5-hrt1)
c1e disabled:
  -- power consumption about 27 watts
  -- there are no any power state enabled (including C1)
  -- there are no additional 260 timer interrupts per seconds
tested with 2.6.23-rc6-hrt1/x86_64.
I want to reduce the power consumption of my notebook. I see the 2 possibility:
  -- remove 260 additional timer interrupts (c1e enabled case )
  -- force enable C1, C2 and C3 states  (c1e disabled case)
Do you have any idea how it can be reached?
