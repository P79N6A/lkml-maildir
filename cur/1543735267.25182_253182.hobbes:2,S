No longer true. We now have UPIO_IOMEM32 for some of the fscked up HW 
that large silicon manufacturer has released with 32-bit wide registers
that must be accessed as full 32-bits.

If clauses will still be needed, the only difference is that instead
of basing them on hardcoded addresses we now base them on
the devices coming in.
