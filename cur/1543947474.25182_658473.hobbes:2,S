No very specific advice to give but this is what I do and then pull all 
(compilable) topic branches into a "local" branch for complation. Just 
wanted to remark that a definite downside is that switching branches a lot 
also touches the tree a lot and hence tends to trigger quite unwelcome 
amounts of recompiles. Using ccache would proably be effective in this 
situation but I keep neglecting to check it out...
