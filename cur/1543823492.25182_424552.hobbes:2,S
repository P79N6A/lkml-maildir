This is a topic that comes up every year or so.  Every year the result is 
the same.  It is not going to happen.
First of all, your assumptions are incorrect.  Modern versions of X are 
not old, unoptimised, will do remote sessions, etc.
There are a couple of very hard problems here.
First you have to come up with a design that is better than X.  That is 
pretty hard.  Next you have to convince all the programmers to port their 
code over to use your new spiffy API.  That is even harder.
Until you have a working model, or at least a design, you can blue-sky all 
you want.  It won't get anywhere and just waste other people's electrons.
