That should be fine. That patch applies on top of Jespers patch which
started this thread, which I plan to push to Dave today.

Unfortunately we need to provide compatibility.

I wasn't sure whether eviction was happening intentional in the old code
at all - still not able to locate the code where this happens, just
noticed that it does do eviction when I manually tried to trigger
a table overflow by adding entries through /proc. Anyway, it should
be easy to fix by keeping an additional lru list. I'll post
an updated patch soon.
