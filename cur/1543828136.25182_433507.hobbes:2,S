How about:
SunVTS software
The SunVTS software executes multiple diagnostic hardware tests from a
single user interface, and is used to verify the configuration and
functionality of most hardware controllers and devices. The SunVTS 
software
operates primarily from a graphical user interface, enabling test 
parameters
to be set quickly and easily while a diagnostic test operation is being
performed.
http://docs.sun.com/source/817-7665/pmemtest.html
The pmemtest checks the physical memory of the system and reports hard and
soft error correction code (ECC) errors, memory read errors, and 
addressing problems. The pseudo driver mem is used to read the physical 
memory.
Note - 64-bit tests are located in the sparcv9 subdirectory:
/opt/SUNWvts/bin/sparcv9/testname, or the relative path to which you
installed SunVTS. If a test is not present in this directory, then it 
might
be available as a 32-bit test only. For more information, see 32-Bit and
64-Bit Tests
