Subject: [patch] latest 'guaranteed low latency' patch against 2.2.14
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is the changelog of 
http://www.redhat.com/~mingo/lowprio-2.2.14-B1.
Changes since lowlatency-2.2.13-A1 (many thanks go to William Montgomery
who collected most of these bugfixes):
  - fixed trivial bug in #define udelay_resched(n) (William Montgomery)
  - fixed cpu idle race condition which allowed idle task to effectively
    have higher priority than SCHED_FIFO task. (Jamie Lokier and William
    Montgomery)
  - fixed race in setting need_resched during task switching (me)
  - fixed bottom half processing to always allow bottom half processing
    have priority over user processes. (Andrea Arcangeli and me)
  - fixed signal handling so that a need_resched after a do_signal is
    properly noticed. (me)
  - fixed ret_with_resched race which occurs when an intr sets
    need_resched _after_ it was checked. (Jamie Lokier)
  - ported to 2.2.14 (me)
Comments, reports welcome.
