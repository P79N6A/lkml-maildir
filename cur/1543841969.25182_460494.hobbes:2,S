actually it has never been really a filename. It was a simple pattern
that the initial hotplug script and later the udev script mapped 1:1 to
a filename on your filesystem. If you check the mailing list archives of
LKML and linux-hotplug you will see that I always resisted in allowing
drivers to include a directory path in that call. A couple of people
tried this and it is not what it was meant to be.
The MODULE_FIRMWARE approach simply makes this pattern visible via
modinfo, because otherwise you would have to scan the source code to
find this pattern. And to make it use you have to apply the same policy
the firmware script is applying when choosing the file. Currently this
is a 1:1 mapping.

Marcel
