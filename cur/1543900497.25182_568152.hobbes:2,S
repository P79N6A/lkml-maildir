This sounds awesome.  Am I correct in expecting that ultimately the
existing hibernation implementation just goes away and we reuse (and hence
strengthen) the existing kexec (and kdump?) infrastructure?
And that we get hibernation support almost for free on all kexec (and
relocatable-kernel?) capable architectures?
And that all the management of hibernation and resume happens in userspace?
I didn't understand the ACPI problem.  Does this mean that CONFIG_ACPI must
be disabled in the to-be-hibernated kernel, or in the little transient
kexec kernel?
How close do you think all this is to being a viable thing?
