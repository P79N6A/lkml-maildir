Yes and no.  We aren't chasing our tail, but that's because the 
application is suppossed to call the GETOPTR ioctl in order to trigger a 
pointer update.  In short, the GETOPTR ioctl is our cue that the 
application knows about the empty space and will fill it.  We can always 
make the thing chase it's tail unconditionally, but then you risk 
playing total garbage when the application falls behind :-/

Interesting...two seconds after the buffer ran out of data, quake 
*finally* calls one of the ioctls that then calls i810_update_ptrs()...

I see no reason to drain the dac on close for mmaped stuff.  The 
application can check GETOPTR to see if the last stuff has played if it 
really cares that much.  I'm going to skip the drain_dac() calls on mmap 
from now on.  That will solve that problem (and it's also the right 
thing to do if we are chasing our tail and have set the software pointer 
to God only knows where as far as the final sounds are concerned).
