Yep, that's what I did. I was just caught by surprise discovering the new
behavior :) and it if it was to be the default, it would have created a big
problem for distributions compatibility-wise.

Great, that's good enough.

Right, but that way you're granting a non-privileged user the superuser
rights without proper authentication/authorization. I see use for
non-restricted chown in tight groups of cooperating people, but in general
it looks to be more a hazard than an advantage. I might be wrong, though...
And what about the right to partially control the file whose ownership you
transferred to another user? Currently it is possible to chmod a file to
0600 (or directory to 0700), chown it to root and then remove it - but you
cannot write to it not even open it. Also, an administrator might expect
that a file created with the root rights in the user's directory will remain
untouchable/unreadable/inmutable to the user, but this is not so - the user
can remove any files created by root whether or not restricted_chown is in
effect. That might be quite a nightmare for the admins. Or at the very least
it's inconsistent with other filesystems. 
Anyhow, maybe I'm completely wrong on the above topics, but it does seem
like a security problem in general..
