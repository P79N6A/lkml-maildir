Hi!  In the driver I'm working on, a tasklet is scheduled
from time to time.  Are there any guarantees as to when
it will run?  I'm worried, for example, about module
unloading: how to be sure that the scheduled tasklet runs
before the module is unloaded?
Thanks,
Duncan.
PS: My first thought was to use tasklet_kill, but according
to "Linux device drivers" (2nd ed) that may hang if the
tasklet isn't pending.
PPS: Another thought was to call schedule(), hoping that
all pending asklets will get run then, but is that reliable?
