This is not good. Every printk() with the problem ends up with
an extra character in the format string and possibly extra overhead.
For what? So you can have a 5 GB structure in kernel space?
Let's keep the multi-gigabyte data structures in userspace, if anywhere.
I'd expect the compiler to choke on anything that big.
