Hello!
   2.3.8 panics when I try to do cat BIGFILE >/dev/null
   It oppses first time, then prints
   "kernel BUG at buffer.c:1218!"
   And then another oops, this time in swapper occurs,
   in the same place as previous.
   And after complain 'Aiee, killing interrupt handler
   Kernel panic: Attempted to kill idle task!
   In swapper task - not syncing'
   system hangs. Not VT switches.
   Alt-SysRq U/S result in another oops
   The oops is very same as one I reported yesterday with 2.3.8-pre2
Bye,
    Oleg
