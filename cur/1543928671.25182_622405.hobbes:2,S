If you read my explaination of the purpose of handle_simple_irq() you'll
see that for the _correct_ case where this handler should be used, the
mask and unmask can only be empty.  To repeat for the third time - it's
for the case where the hardware supplies NO way to mask the interrupt.
So adding calls to the mask/unmask methods would be pointless for the
correct use case.
If you do have the ability to mask, then you should be using the level or
edge handlers.
