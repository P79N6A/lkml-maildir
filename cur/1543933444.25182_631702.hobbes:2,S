I had a nice idea to fix this ... will post a patch to do that later.

Unless we're talking about crazy, crazy programs that blindly open and
read every file in sysfs as root (yes, they exist, and they already cause
problems simply by reading past the first 64 bytes of config space which
causes problems for, eg, sym53c875 cards), non-root accesses are already
restricted to the first 64 bytes, so it's no more of a problem than it
currently is.
