Looking at some architectures it appears that asm/uaccess.h should be  
used instead of asm/segment.h.  Is this generally true that code in  
segment.h should be moved into uaccess.h or is it still valid for an  
architecture to have segment.h?
I'm cleaning up arch/ppc and arch/ppc64 and was wondering about  
everyone else.
