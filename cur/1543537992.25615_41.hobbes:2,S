Is anyone listening to what Linus is saying in the "joint letter on low 
latency and Linux" thread? If so, why is there still a flamewar going on 
over this?

The only problem Linus has over Ingo's low-latency patches is that they were 
rescheduling calls put in simply to make a single benchmark test run 
faster--something that he has said many times before is a stupid thing to 
do. He agrees that a reschedule call needs to go into the copy_from_user() 
code:
>I'd be quite happy to apply the copy_to/from_user() part, for example, and
>then let's see what the other problem-spots are, and how they should be

simply because the code obviously needs it, and it's not just stuck in 
blindly because a benchmark would run faster. Furthermore, in regard to the 
argument over whether pro-audio needs RTLinux or not, he says explicitly:
>In many cases I just think that RTLinux is a worse fix than the disease. I
>think RTLinux is perfect for those things that truly need latency
>guarantees: no OS at _all_ in the way. But using it for "normal" stuff

In those three posts, he points out exactly how to solve the problem. Just 
Use The Source (tm) to figure out where we need to reduce latency problems. 
The audio people are convinced that they only need around 1 or 2 orders of 
magnitude _worst-case_ improvement (100ms to 5ms) to run perfectly fine, and 
don't need RTLinux's usec latency OR mission-critical hard-time guarantees.
So to end this whole stupid flamewar, all we have to do is look at the code 
and find a _few_ places where we can easily and obviously reduce latency. 
Start with the copy_to/from_user() code. Maybe through a huge coincidence, 
the places we _decide_ to put in reschedule calls will be exactly the same 
places Ingo already put them in:
>Maybe people in the end can convince me that every single
>scheduling point [in Ingo's patch] makes 100% sense, and is not a hack at 
>all but a natural thing.
But then we'll _know_ why we put them there.
Linus's voice isn't (quite) the word of God, but when he's explaining 
_exactly_ what we need to do to fix the problem, I think it would behoove us 
to listen...
