The real problem with using that sort of BSD licence is that if multiple
people use varrients of it. Say if all the packages in a Linux distro were
under a licence that made adverts contain 'derrived from code developed by
<insert developer here>'. A dist like redhat would have to take out 5 page
adds just to mention the product. :)
The advert clause makes products not scale. :)
