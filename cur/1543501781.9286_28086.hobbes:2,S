	LDAP is USER SPACE problem.  To decode that acronym:
		Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
	It is certain kind of database interrogation protocol,
	and in itself it has nothing to do with the KERNEL.
	It is usually implemented over TCP/IP sockets, but
	even that is not mandatory.  (Also, the databases
	behind it are not necessarily any DIRECTORY (X.500)
	type things.)
