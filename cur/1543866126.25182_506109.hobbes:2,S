Hi,
I'm creating a driver for timer on ixp4xx (there are two hardware timers). 
It shall use posix api
so I looked at the only driver that implements it in kernel: 
drivers/char/mmtimer.c. My driver uses almost the
same logic that handles overruns.
However, I found that receiving of number of overruns in waitsiginfo is 
somewhat broken.
Linux-2.6.20:
Look at posix_timer_event - this is called when interrupt wants to signal 
the thread that
event happend. The very first operation there is
        memset(&timr->sigq->info, 0, sizeof(siginfo_t));
this clears all info members - si.overrun included.
Then send_sigqueue or send_group_sigqueue is called. They both check if 
it's
SI_TIMER and if so, they increase si.overrun if the signal is already 
queued.
But if the next interrupt arrives before function collect_signal is called 
to actually deliver the
siginfo_t to userspace, the si.overrun is cleared in posix_timer_event and 
we have just forgotten
one overrun...
Am I wrong?
Patch follows, but please note that it is more to describe the problem 
than solve the problem in proper
way...
Please, CC me, I'm not subscribed on the list.
