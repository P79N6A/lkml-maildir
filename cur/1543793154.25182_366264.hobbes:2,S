I'm a user of relayfs and I do think the control files should go with
their channels, FWIW.
Where else would they go? Some other completely unrelated place?
IMO It makes a lot of sense to have a single place, and preferably a
simple api like the relay-apps that Tom already did so as to to make the
simple case easy.
A control file is part of the relay channel, it's the way the kernel and
user mode parts communicate to do fast mmap transfers of the data. It is
possible to do the signalling by using simple file read/write but the
mmap method provides for a lot less copying around.
