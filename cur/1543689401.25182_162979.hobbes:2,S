Using the high flag bits probably isn't a good idea for two reasons:
1. We already use bit 31 to indicate the busy status:
   #define IORESOURCE_BUSY         0x80000000      /* Driver has marked this resource busy */
   However, it looks like bits 27 to 17 are currently unused.
2. The resource tree won't know about the upper bits or whatever sitting
   in flags, and as such identical addresses on two different buses will
   clash.
Resource start,end needs to be some unique quantity no matter which (PCI)
bus you are on.
