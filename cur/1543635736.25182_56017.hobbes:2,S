Mark is off climbing Mt. Hood, so he asked me to post the data on the fsync
patch.
It appears from these results that there is no appreciable improvement using
the
fsync patch - there is a slight loss of top end on 4 adapters 1 drive. 
 It's worthnoting that these numbers  are a definite improvement over
generic 2.4.18.
 Something has been done right in 2.4.19rc1.  I included an excerpt of the
data that Mark
 posted for 2.4.18 at the end of this email.
As to scaling - well it scales in reverse.  Two adapters from one to three
drives 
is scaling in the right direction. From then on it's in decline.
Here's the data.
The system is a dual PCI/66 box with 4 good SCSI cards with up to 6
15KRPM ST318452LC drives per card.  (dual 1.2Ghz Pentium 3 with 2 Gig RAM
running kernels high mem support == OFF )
