Sounds like broken MTU discovery or incorrect firewalling at the remote
end. 2.0 probably isnt doing path mtu discovery. Quite a few large web sites
have incorrectly configured firewalls, including one very big one beginning
with Y. These people often paid a consultant a lot of money to break their
networking and they wont listen to other people telling them its wrong.
