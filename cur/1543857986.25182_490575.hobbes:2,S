Well, if you accept to run slow there's nothing to solve in the first
place indeed.
If nothing else rdtscp should avoid the mess of restarting a
vsyscalls, which is quite a difficult problem as it heavily depends on
the compiler/dwarf.

Isn't rdtscp atomic? all you need is to read atomically the current
contents of the tsc and the index to use in a per-cpu table exported
in readonly. This table will contain a per-cpu seqlock as well. Then a
math logic has to be built with per-cpu threads, so that those per-cpu
tables are updated by cpufreq and at regular intervals.
If this is all wrong and it's not feasible to implement a safe and
monothonic vgettimeofday that doesn't access the southbridge and that
doesn't require restarting the vsyscall manually by patching rip/rsp,
I've an hard time to see how rdtscp is useful at all. I hope somebody
thought about those issues before adding a new instruction to a
popular CPU ;).
