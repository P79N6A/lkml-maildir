I have scsi patches!
mptbase-reset-ioc-initiator-during-pci-resume.patch
  Fixes suspend/resume on all of Darrick's MPT cards.  I first merged it
  in September 2007.
kill-warnings-in-mptbaseh-on-parisc64.patch
  Warning fixes.
dell-cerc-support-for-megaraid_mbox.patch
  Turns non-booting machiens into booting ones.  Merged in -mm in
  November 2007.
3w-raid-drivers-memset-not-needed-in-probe.patch
  Small optimisation
scsi-aic94xx-cleanups.patch
  cleanups only.
scsi-qlogicptic-section-fixes.patch
  Fixes a reference from .text into .init.text and hence might fix a
  machine crash when this driver is build into vmlinux.  Merged a week ago.
megaraid-outb_p-extermination.patch
  Cleanup
gdth-convert-to-pci-hotplug-api.patch
  Just merged
So several of these patches address quite seriosu bugs, and have been
stuck in my tree for far too long.
