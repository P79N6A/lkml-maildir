Subject: 2.6.9-rc1 hangs on mounting root-over-nfs

Hi,
we run a diskless system where clients boot via pxelinux, get their IP
from kernel ip autoconfig and mount their root directory with root-over-nfs.
It all works fine with 2.6.8.1 and earlier.
Now I tested 2.6.9-rc1 (and also tried already with the patch that reverts
nfs_fh_copy() in case that was causing it, but it wasn't). The IP-Config part
goes fine and gets the right values. But then the clients hang:
...
Looking up port of RPC 10003/3 on xx.xx.1.132
portmap: server xx.xx.1.132 not responding, timed out
Root-NFS: Unable to get nfsd port number from server, using default
Looking up port of RPC 10003/3 on xx.xx.1.132
RPC: error 5 connecting to server 141.84.1.132
(same messages repeated a few times).
I didn't change the config compared to 2.6.8.1 (using the default and
adding some options of my own). The network driver is tg3 (for 3com
3c996bt cards).
There are now related messages in the nfs servers log. The last messages
I see there is the successful dhcp request.
Can I provide more information?
cu,
Frank
