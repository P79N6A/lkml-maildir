Hi,
   I'm just a humble user, and not a developer, but this patch looks wrong.  
As far as I remember, the whole point to the HIDBP keyboard and HIDBP mouse 
drivers  was to provide minimal support for USB mice and keyboards, if 
someone didn't need everything in the full hid driver.  If the full hid driver
is included in the kernel, there is no point to building in the stripped down
drivers as well.  The full hid driver supports everything the HIDBP drivers
do, plus a whole lot more. The stripped down drivers for example don't support 
any special keys on the keyboard, or any of the fancy mouse protocols like 
IMPS/2, or at least, they didn't the last time I looked at them.
