OK.
ISTM that conflating CONFIG_HOTPLUG and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is both a
mistake and confusing.  CONFIG_HOTPLUG help text specifically talks
about hot-pluggable devices and /dev.  I can imagine some engineers
saying that CPUs and MEM are (abstract) devices, but I don't think that
most users would go that far, so I think that HOTPLUG and HOTPLUG_CPU
should be totally independent.
