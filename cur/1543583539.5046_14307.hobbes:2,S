My guess would be that the driver has decided there's no
link beat on the 10baseT interface and has flopped over
to using 10base2.  A fix for this exists in 2.4.2-ac5+,
in the zerocopy patch and in
	
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/3c59x.c-2.4.2-pre4.gz
but not in 2.4.2.
You'll need to use
	options 3c59x options=0
in /etc/modules.conf to pin the driver down to using a 
particular physical interface - disable autoselection.
So could you please upgrade the driver?  If problems
remain, please send me a report, as described in the
final section of Documentation/networking/vortex.txt.
Thanks.
