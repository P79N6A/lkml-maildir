Oh, it works well enough for non shared iqs if you are really anal about
it, but I agree that it sucks and I don't see the point of having it in
linux. The flow has to be different for level vs. edge and it's really
ugly but it works. I've seen people doing it in embedded space. But
again, I do agree it sucks big time :-)
the edge flow is easy. the level one is:
 - IRQ happens
 - kernel handler masks it and queue a msg for userland
 - later on, userland gets the message, talks to the device,
   (MMAP'ed mmio, acks the interrupt on the device itself) and
   does an ioctl/syscall/write/whatever to tell kernel it's done
 - kernel unmasks it.
But yeah, I hate it too, so let's not waste time talking about how to
make it work :-)
