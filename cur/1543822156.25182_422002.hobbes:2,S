Perhaps kernel threads in D state should not contribute toward load avg.
Userspace does not care whether there are 2 or 20 pdflush threads waiting
for IO. However, when the network/disks can no longer keep up, userspace
processes will end up going to sleep in writeback or reclaim -- *that* is
when we start feeling the load.
