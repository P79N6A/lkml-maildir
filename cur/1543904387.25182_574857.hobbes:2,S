Hi Ingo,
The problem I see is that the current load balancing code is quite
hueristic and can be quite inaccurate sometimes. Its goal is to maintain
roughly equal load on each core, where load is defined to be the sum of
the weights of all tasks on a core. If all tasks have the same weight,
this is a simple problem. If different weights exist, this is an NP-hard
problem and our current hueristic can perform badly under various
workloads. A simple example, if we have four tasks on two cores and they
have weights 1, 5, 7, 7. The balanced partition would have 1 and 7 on
core 1 and 5 and 7 on core 2. But you can see the load isn't evenly
distributed; in fact, it's not possible to evenly distribute the load in
this case. Thus, my opinion is that only balancing the load as we do now
is not enough to achieve SMP fairness. My patch was intended to address
this problem.

PS. I now have a lockless implementation of my patch. Will post later
today.
