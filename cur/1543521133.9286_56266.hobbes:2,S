Hi all,
Firstly, wishing you all a great new year.
I have an Eicon Diva 2.01 ISDN card and using Redhat 6.1. I have also have 
downloaded the isdn4linux utility. The card is being detected by Linux. The 
interrupt is alloted(checked thru /proc/interrupts). Using some example 
shell scripts which I found on the net I tried to test the card. But I was 
not at all successful. If I give the command to dial from "isdnctrl" I just 
get a "call triggered" reply and back to prompt. What does this mean. How 
do I check data transfer?
1) Can I call up any normal telephone with this setup or has it necessarily 
to be an ISP. I ask this bcoz I just want to test whether I can call using 
the card and I donot intend to connect to any isp.
2) Should I use pppd or any other utility.
3) Is it possible to setup the device using gnome or kde without using 
isdn4linux. Or can I use isdn4linux to set up the device and then call thru 
"PPP dialer"
I am really desperate to set up this thing and am failing from the past 3 
days. Any step by step instructions will be great.
I also glanced thru the isdn4linux faq but did not find any answer 
suitable.
TIA nad regards,
Vinu
