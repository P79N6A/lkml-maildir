Hello,
I do have an Asus P2B-S Mainboard and since a week I have a Maxtor 60 GB
5400 rpm Harddrive (MAXTOR 4K060H3).
I tried the performance of the drive and got some results which are quite
low I think.
hdparm -t /dev/hdc returns
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.63 seconds = 11.37 MB/sec
What would be a value I can expect from my hardware? And what might result
in higher speeds?
thanks,
thomas
