Hi,
while investigating why some LPRng hang when there's no spooler
running I stumbled over the following strace. Note: before the
bind, there's nobody listening on local port 515 and there
are no socket relevant syscalls between the bind and connect:
1054  bind(5, {sin_family=AF_INET, 
               sin_port=htons(515), 
               sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = 0
...
1054  connect(5, {sin_family=AF_INET, 
                  sin_port=htons(515), 
                  sin_addr=inet_addr("127.0.0.1")}, 16) = 0
Obviously the process has just connected to itself
on port 515 - though it never did an accept(). Is this to be expected?
This is with kernel 2.2.1.
Cheers, Roderich
