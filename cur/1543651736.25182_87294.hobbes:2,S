I'm writing a driver that provides an ethernet like interface to a WAN 
link.  The device DMA's the data from me, then tells me when it's 
finished.  At that point I free the skb.  However I get the following 
warning
kernel: Warning: kfree_skb on hard IRQ d092c301
What is bad about calling kfree_skb from within a hard IRQ?  I'm afraid 
looking at the code that spat out the error message didn't help me, and 
since it's only a warning I'm assuming it's not fatal, but shouldn't be 
done for some reason.
Thanks.
Bill
