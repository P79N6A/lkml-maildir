The interesting bits..
[   46.075145] cpufreq-core: trying to register driver centrino
here we've done sysdev_driver_register(&cpu_sysdev_class,&cpufreq_sysdev_driver);
(see cpufreq_register_driver in drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq.c)
This is the only place we register sysdev entries.

[   46.075176] cpufreq-core: initialization failed
Same for the 2nd CPU.
[   46.075180] cpufreq-core: no CPU initialized for driver centrino
here we hit this part of cpufreq_register_driver
                /* if all ->init() calls failed, unregister */
                if (ret) {
                        dprintk("no CPU initialized for driver %s\n",
                                                        driver_data->name);
                        sysdev_driver_unregister(&cpu_sysdev_class,
                                                &cpufreq_sysdev_driver);
So we release all the refs.

[   46.075190] cpufreq-core: unregistering CPU 1
These are the sysdev callbacks.

These drivers don't even get as far as calling cpufreq_register_driver,
they ENODEV way before things get that far along.

Boom.  I'm really puzzled. At this point, we shouldn't have any leaked refs
on the objects.  Needs more thinking.
