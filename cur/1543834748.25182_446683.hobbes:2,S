You're right, it won't be easy for an application to detect if gettimeofday uses
a vdso that is more lightweight than a regular syscall, but it can measure how
much cpu a periodic call to gettimeofday uses vs. how much cpu a periodic rtc
interrupt uses.  It can use that information to make an informed decision about
which interface to use.  Alternatively, a package can be built with sane
defaults in mind (always use RTC vs. always use gettimeofday).

Yes, I intend to (I've got a steep learning curve, since I've not worked much
with glibc, and I've never implemented a vdso call before), but I think thats a
great idea.  My point is, why not have both interfaces available?  That way,
implementations which can't do any better via a vdso call can still get a
speedup through the legacy interface.
