Yes, I have. This is a dual Firewire/USB enclosre. I can test with
usb-storage, but I had really scary problems with it some time ago (like it
saying that the media from my HD was removed --- when it obviously wasn't
and, to top it off, I could reproduce it, but it was with kernels like
2.6.7 or so).
I think that I can also try some stress tests with an ext2/ext3 filesystem
and Firewire (i.e., trying to rule out the hfsplus variable from the
problem).

Yes, that can't be ruled out, but the messages all mentioned the problem
inside the hfsplus module. I will test it anyway.

Yes, I will recompile a newer copy as soon as I get up (it's really early
in the morning here and I need to sleep now).
Anyway, if any further information is necessary, please let me know.
Thanks for the prompt response, Rogério Brito.
