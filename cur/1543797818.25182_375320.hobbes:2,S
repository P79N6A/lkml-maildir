Yeah, it's not that nice.  After all we don't use mmio at all on visw but
pio.  So why do we need the flushing at all?

Macros with implicit arguments are pretty horrible.  If we want to go down
that road we should add a macro that expands to either version depending
on the config flags.
While we're at it, does anyone know whyt the ioread* interface doesn't
provide the _relaxed version?  I'd really love to switch qla1280 over to it
given that it needs to support both mmio and pio.
