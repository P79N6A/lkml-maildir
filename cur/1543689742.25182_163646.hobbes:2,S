You can use -O2 and rely on inline done by hand.  I can add option
-fno-inline-functions-called-once.  That should avoid such a problems.
Anyway it would be nice to mark functions that exist for this reason by
noinline attribute so compiler knows about it, but that is different
story.

Some of this should be already tested by folks using Intel compiler I
would hope.
