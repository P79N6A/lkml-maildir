Ah - I assumed you were going to do this based on MAC addresses.
i.e. 
foreach interface; do
	get mac address
	lookup the desired interface name for this mac address
	set name accordingly
done
You could also possibly do it by snooping on the interface to see which IP 
addresses are on it, or trying DHCP. The point was that this isn't a kernel 
problem.
