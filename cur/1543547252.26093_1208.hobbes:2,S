I agree. Firstly, you can't frob random memory with the MTRR driver,
so it clearly doesn't need CAP_SYS_RAWIO. Secondly, if a privileged
process (i.e. one which can open RW) wishes to pass the FD, then that
should be allowed.
Besides, we have this nice access control method in Unix: file
permissions. Why not use it?
So, I'm inclined to replace the calls to suser() with a check for
write access on the filp.
