mmap() packet socket interface eliminates the need for system calls when
traffic is coming in at a high rate.  The kernel -> user copy is also
eliminated, but its just replaced with a kernel -> kernel copy :P
You could perhaps also use linux socket filters to minimize the number
of packets you need to evaluate...
