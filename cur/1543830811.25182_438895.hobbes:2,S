CPU is VIA C3 in EBGA "Nehemiah" core 6.9.8.
I'm using flush_cache_all(). Is there anything more powerfull?
I'm using MSR_VIA_FCR.
I can disable L2 cache (or at least I think so) - this doesn't help.
I can't disable L1 cache - processor stops when I'm trying to set 
I-cache or D-cache disable bit.
Thanks
Rafał
