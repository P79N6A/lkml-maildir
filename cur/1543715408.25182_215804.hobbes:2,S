date seems to gain 9sec/hour on my Shuttle/SN41G2/FN41 when using IOAPIC
timer.
booted with "noapic" for XT-PIC timer, it stays locked
onto my wristwatch after an hour.  If the workaround is disabled,
and XT-PIC timer is used, it matches the "noapic" behaviour -- no drift.
I can't explain it.  I think it is a timer problem independent of the
IRQ routing.

ps. when i ran in XT-PIC mode there were lots of ERR's registered in
/proc/interrupts -- doesn't look healthy.
