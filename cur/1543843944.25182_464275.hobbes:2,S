This is not that different from what gcc does for DWARF.  Trouble is,
there appear to exist optimization transformations which make such
data difficult or impossible to generate.  (In particular, it is
unlikely to be easier to create specialized data like this if the
compiler can't be made to create first-class DWARF for the same probe
points / data values.)
