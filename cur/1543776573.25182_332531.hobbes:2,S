Okay, I'll send you the vmlinux from -18 with a new digital photo, and config, 
with CONFIG_4KSTACKS enabled.
Do you want me to apply the patch blitz you just sent to the list before 
testing? Those are some impressive stack reductions, the 
ip_sockglue.c/blkdev_get() ones in combination look promising.

I guess also, as you suggested elsewhere in this thread, I could try an 8K 
stacks kernel, let openvpn run (even just for 5 minutes, then close it) and 
see if I get a stack-footprint dump *for openvpn*, which so far I've not been 
able to observe.
Hopefully this would negate the possibility that there's a stack-footprint 
waiting to be generated, but just masked by the crash.
Is this actually useful to you?
