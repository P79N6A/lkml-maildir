Hah, you too!  I knew Ben and Nick had designs in that kind
of direction, and meant to leave the field clear for them; but
once the vma idea struck me, it seemed silly not to pursue it.

Thanks.  (It's only the 32-bit emulation case I'm caring about,
that poses a problem for free_pgtables: I'm not sure whether you're
meaning to VMA-ize the 64-bit one too, that's entirely up to you.)

Sorry for bumping you into this, but I think it's the right approach.
ARM can justify its special FIRST_USER_ADDRESS treatment because (as
I understaned it) the low vectors just have to be set up earlier and
cleared later, but your case is at a higher level.
