No, the hypervisor does not give the notification immediatly. A discard
fault is delivered to the guest if it tries to access a page that has
been removed by the host. That is the fundamental difference between a
memory ballooner and the guest page hinting.

Truncating is similar but the reaction is different. A truncated page is
gone and will not be recreated. A discarded page can be reloaded.

NUMA node is not granular enough, mem_section is probably doable. I do
not understand the part about the bit in the mem_map[] area, a bit in
the page->flags is exactly that, isn't it?
