Notice that he was talking about non-i386 platforms... And really I've
seen sparclinux crashing and we are now having problems with 100mbit
ethernet going up and down... 
BTW was anyone able to run 2.2.6 on sun4/330? It mounts / partition
but does not seem to launch init. Older versions were able to boot
with init=/sbin/init, but not with init=/bin/bash. Was anyone
successfull with sun4 lately?
