But Linus wasn't comparing the same version of the kernel.  So it was
a bit unknown.  Having someone reproduce those lm_bench numbers on the
exact same kernel would be interesting.

Agreed.
We also need a way to boot a kernel on an old machine with limited memory.
Possibly we would only support this if PSE is not supported, which old machines
don't support.
The complication that the decompressor must relocation the image for
supporting old bootloaders is challenging in the context or a truly relocatable
kernel, where we run at the address the bootloader put us.
The basic other concern is how flexible do we need to be with respect to relocation.
