I meant a different thing. Distro is a commercial entity.
Users can buy services from businesses. "Write (or fix) me a driver"
is a service.
People inclined to just pay for code instead of helping with coding
may have greater success talking to distros.
Of course, distros then will hire someone from lkml crowd to actually do it.
If there will be enough of cash flow from such requests, this can
becode somebody's full time job.
