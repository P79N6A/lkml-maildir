Try this with most SCSI card/driver combinations and you will have trouble.
The bus reset performed by the second SCSI card to start up will screw up the
operation of the first SCSI card. IF you use some sequencing trick to get
things to start up you still cannot reboot one backup machine without
screwing up the operation of the other.
With some SCSI cards a specially adapted driver could get around this
problem, but with other cards the hardware prevents this from ever working
reliably.
