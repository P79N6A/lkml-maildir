What do you want to happen if there are two simultaneous TCP connections?
Should you get the data from the two connections mixed up, in the order
the packets are acked?  If you want totally coherent data, you'd have to
wait until the connection was closed, then read it all.
Either way, it is do-able from user-space, although it might be easier
with a kernel hook somewhere.
