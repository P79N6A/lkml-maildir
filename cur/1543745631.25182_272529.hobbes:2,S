Hey, go ahead, do the split and please, please use sk->sk_prot, that is
the way to do the proper split and will allow us to nuke several
pointers in struct sock (sk_slab, sk_owner for now) :-)
I have a friend doing this for X.25, will submit his patches as soon
as we do some more testing and 2.6.10 is out.
