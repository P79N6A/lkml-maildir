The version in the kernel always crashed on me.  I've been having very good
success with the CVS versions at linux1394.sf.net though.  Only problems I've
been having are with leaving the kernel modules loaded (no 1394 hardware left
installed though) during a laptop suspend.. keyboard wasn't working on resume.
The disk and dvd+rw drive i have have worked flawlessly with the sbp2 driver
though.  And they do appear as normal scsi devices (they're announced when
the sbp2 driver loads, if you insert something later or remove something, you
have to do the scsi-add-single-device trick to rescan devices).
