Just wondering, why didn't you do it with a
CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL/CONFIG_CMDLINE set of options?  The way you did it,
I _think_ you can't actually get a help msg from 'config' or
'oldconfig', you'll just set the commandline to '?'.
Also, on current PPC, if we have a compiled-in commandline we put it in
arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c and allow it to be overridden.  This even makes
it semi-useful outside of the self-containted {b,}zImage situation.
