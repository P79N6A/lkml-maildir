Gene, you're agreeing with me. You've shown that you're very happy with a fair 
distribution of cpu and leaving X at nice 0.

It's those who want X to have an unfair advantage that want it to do 
something "special". Your agreement that it works fine at nice 0 shows you 
don't want it to have an unfair advantage. Others who want it to have an 
unfair advantage _can_ renice it if they desire. But if the cpu scheduler 
gives X an unfair advantage within the kernel by default then you have _no_ 
choice. If you leave the choice up to userspace (renice or not) then both 
parties get their way. If you put it into the kernel only one party wins and 
there is no way for the Genes (and Cons) of this world to get it back.
Your opinion is as valuable as eveyone else's Gene. It is hard to get people 
to speak on as frightening a playground as the linux kernel mailing list so 
please do.
