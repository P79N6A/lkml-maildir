I'll be surprised if the following line works:
	nodemask_t node_offline_map = nodes_complement(node_online_map);
1) Doesn't nodes_complement return void, and work in place?
2) It might set bits above MAX_NUMNODES, if MAX_NUMNODES isn't a word size multiple.
I am less sure of (2) - the exact details of handling the unused bits of
a bitmask are still confusing me.  But this would be one of the very
rare situations that I can find that would actually be sensitive to
possible confusions here - most places don't set bits that aren't
already set in some mask, or are careful to initialize a mask with just
set bits in select positions from 0 to MAX_NUMNODES-1.
