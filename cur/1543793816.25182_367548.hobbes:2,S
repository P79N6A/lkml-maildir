I would argue that it does not dig deeply enough.  I think it would be
better to expand dplace to handle early-for activity.  It would be nice
to get a hook in do_fork before the call to copy_process so we can place
the child task struct on the destination instead of the source node.
That said, I could swear that dplace or something that looks a lot like
dplace was already posted on lkml, but I did not find it when I searched.
Maybe my archive is missing some stuff.
