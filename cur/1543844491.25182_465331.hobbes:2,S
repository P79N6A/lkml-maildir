There are two problems:
1) If this goes in, similar fixes for sys_ia32.c, mips64, et al.
   should go in at the same time.
2) I dislike this fix because it means that users can lock down
   a significant amount of non-swappable kernel memory.  There are
   no privilege checks in the get_kernel_syms() system call, so
   anyone can invoke it.  Imagine a fork bomb invoking this, and it
   could also potentially eat up nearly all of the vmalloc() space.
It may be, in the end, simply better to have a
"compat_sys_get_kernel_syms" written that can be called
so a temporary kernel copy is not needed.
I'm not offering to implement this :-)  But it does seem to be the
only reasonable solution.
