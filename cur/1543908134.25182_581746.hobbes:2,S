Well, the problem with that is, there will be fuse filesystems which
will want devices to work and for those the capability checks will be
reenabled inside ->mknod().  In fact, for backward compatibility all
filesystems will have the mknod checks, except ones which explicitly
request to turn it off.
Since unprivileged fuse mounts always have "nodev", the only way
security could be screwed up, is if a filesystem running with
privileges disabled the mknod checks.
I will probably add some safety guards against that into the fuse
library, but of course there's no way to stop a privileged user from
screwing up security anyway.
If for example there's a loop mount, where the disk image file is
writable by a user, and root mounts it without "nodev", the user can
still create device nodes (by modifying the image) even if the mknod
checks are enabled.
