Insides of case blocks are indented, didn't you notice? Why waste a tab?

Empty comments segregate related groups of functions.
The return is there in case something else is needed between the if and
the function's end. It's there to underscore the regular structure of the
code. Though the big block comment obscures the intent there. Perhaps
I should relocate it.
You didn't mention empty lines on top of functions. They appear where
variables are likely to be, or if the function body has a break, to make
it fair to all little segments :-)

I don't know anything about VM either and I do not see how this is
relevant.
The bigger point is, if you strive to make a meaningful contribution,
meaningless code rearrangements is not the way to go about it. And
we have plenty of work under the subsystem level, though usually it
has something to do with specific hardware. For example, Firewire
appears to be in dire need of fixing right now.
I remember a period of time when the janitoring project produced
meaningful cleanups, such as verification of failure paths. This work
is still relevant. Just the other day I sent a patch to Dmitry for
a leak in mousedev. And remember the debacle of memset(p, size, 0)!
I'm not going to tell you where to put your nose in, but I would like
to hint that the janitoring project might use some help with something
going beyond the uglification of my pretty code :-)
