I'm not talking about the kernel or about gcc.  I'm talking about random 
packages that *won't configure on Pentium II boxes* because config.guess 
coughs up "i686-...", config.sub sees it and aborts --- its patterns look 
for "i[345]86-" (and occasionally "i[34]86-", in older packages).  I now 
keep around a replacement config.guess and config.sub for these packages.
Some of the packages which do this are fairly recent, too.
This is an autoconf issue; if you insist on tracking exact processor 
versions, get rid of the charclass in config.sub or make it accept any digit 
> 2.  Otherwise the world breaks yet again when someone decides to detect 
the next IA32 increment as an "i786", just as large parts of the world break 
now on "i686".

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
