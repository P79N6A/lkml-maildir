I'm also confused because from your "-mm merge plans" mail I had
understood that both patches would be merged in 2.6.29, and they both
still apply fine on Linus' tree. How come it's a problem they conflicts
in linux-next? Is it because this is currently the merge window? Do I
have to update the patches against linux-next and send them back to you?
Let me know what you need :-)
