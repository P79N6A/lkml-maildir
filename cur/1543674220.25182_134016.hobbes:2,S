The answer to PC/PCI is that the I/O space set (usually by the BIOS)
into the BARs removes any RAM visibility in that area. But.... this
is BAD bacause the BIOS may still claim that there is 4 gig of RAM.
The OS may then try to use it. To "solve" this problem, Win/tell started
the "high-RAM" specification where RAM higher than XXX Megs gets
mapped with page-registers. The problem is that "XXX" is board-specific!
So, to answer your entire question... don't do it! Only use 3 gigs max
and you will not be confused by confused hardware!

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
