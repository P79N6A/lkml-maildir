You're not alone, I think everybody who knows, how things in a 
computer work shares this view.

A few years ago I had some closer contact with a driver developer of a 
well known consumer HW manufacturer hunting down some nasty bugs I 
discovered and developed workarounds for. From him I know, that most 
developers and engineers would have no problem to disclose the 
hardware specifications. The real hinderers are legal affairs and - 
suprisingly - marketing departments; with little more knowledge about 
the internals of their products, for them _everything_ created within 
the company is considered as not to be leaked, valuable information 
by them.
