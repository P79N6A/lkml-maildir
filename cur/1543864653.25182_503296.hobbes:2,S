The OS however has to write the values the HV wants to
the device, or things won't work -- so the HV can just
as well do it itself.  Also, pulling all the work into
the HV makes for a cleaner, more generic design (who
knows what hardware will show up within the next few
years, the HV interface had better be prepared).
