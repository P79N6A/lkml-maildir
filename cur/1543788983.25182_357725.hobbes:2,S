Umm.. why is xinetd listening for ntp requests at all?  I'm pretty sure that
xinetd fighting with xntpd for control of the socket isn't going to work nicely,
although I admit being mystified as to (a) why this ever worked for you and
(b) what specifically changed in -rc4 to cause the CPU spin.
What was the most recent kernel known to work, and what does the xinetd
config file entry for NTP look like?
