This rule is not there any more, but there are a few more:
SMP code that uses the cpu number (i.e. cpu data structures, etc.) and
thus depends on staying on that cpu, should be protected to prevent
preemption, which, MAY move the task to another cpu.  Currently there is
code in the preemption patch to prevent this movement, however, it would
be faster to allow it and protect the areas that care.
Also, areas that use hareware resources that are not saved on preemption
must be protected.  In the x86 this includes some of the MMX code which
uses the fp registers.  
We also had some problems with the page info register on page faults,
however this proved to be a hazard in systems without preemption and
thus was fixed.
