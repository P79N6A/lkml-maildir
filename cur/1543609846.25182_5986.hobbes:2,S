I have had some problem with the PCI direct probe on a MediaGX CPU, 
when the probe looked at the CX5530 companion chip the box would
reboot.  Could you try to only use the PCI BIOS method instead?
PCI support (CONFIG_PCI) [N/y/?] (NEW) y 
  PCI access mode (BIOS, Direct, Any) [Any] (NEW) BIOS
  defined CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS
