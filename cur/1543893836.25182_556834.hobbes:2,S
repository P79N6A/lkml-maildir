You only have to document printks, which are using the KMSG macros.
Since there are tons of self-explaining printks, most of them do not
have to use them.
If you change the meaning of a KMSG printk and you don't update the
documentation, it is the same thing like changing a kernel API function
and forgetting to update the kernel-doc comment.

It is a matter of discipline. If a device driver maintainer decides to
document some messages using the KMSG macros, he has to take care that
the documentation is up-to-date. Since the printks and the descriptions
are maintained together in the kernel code, I think, that's doable. 
And the checker tool can help to keep the descriptions up-to-date, since
it produces warnings, if you use C=1 during the kernel build.

Again, not everybody has to use KMSG printks.

There are quite a lot of messages in our s390 device drivers which
should be documented. Especially for character device drivers (e.g.
tape), where the user has direct interaction with the device.
One Example from the tape device driver: "Another host has reserved the
tape device"
We should document, how to find out the host, which reserved the tape
and what has to be done on the other host in order to release the tape
etc.

Again: Most printks don't need documentation. We can leave them as they
are.

The maintainer of the component (e.g. device driver) is responsible for
the KMSG printks. If he accepts a patch, which modifies KMSG printks, he
has to take care, that the patch also updates the KMSG_DOC part.

For each kernel a separate message catalog can be automatically created.
This message catalog fits exactly to one kernel and should be installed
together with the kernel.
