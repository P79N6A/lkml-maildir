Because that would be a broken design.
And it causes problems as well.
On some architectures kernel access to RTC hangs.
Probably the kernel doesnt know what timezone RTC is supposed to be in.
It doesnt know whether RTC is supposed to be in BCD or in binary.
It doesnt know whether a century byte is supported.
It doesnt know the epoch.

If two things must happen simultaneously, give the user a tool that
does these two things simultaneously - call it "setclock" or so,
but do not patch the kernel.
By the way, I think hwclock is better at setting the time than the kernel is.
I have met people with hardware (Alpha's, I think) where /dev/rtc fails
but "hwclock --directisa" works. I know of no examples of the reverse situation.
