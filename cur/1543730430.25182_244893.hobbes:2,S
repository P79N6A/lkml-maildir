Actually I bet the problem is that the driver is doing request_irq()
on the wrong IRQ.  In s2io.c, s2io_init_nic() does
	sp->irq = pdev->irq;
and then sometime later s2io_open() does
	err =
	    request_irq((int) sp->irq, s2io_isr, SA_SHIRQ, sp->name, dev);
If you put the call to pci_enable_msi() after sp->irq is assigned, the
driver will request the original irq (which will still be in INTx
mode, of course), rather than the new vector assigned by the MSI core.
