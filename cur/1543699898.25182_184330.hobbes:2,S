I read with great interest the thread from a few months ago
regarding the IBM BIOS whitelists for Mini-PCI WLAN cards.
But the thread leaves off with someone waiting for IBM
support and getting an official response that Linux wasn't
supported, so too bad (even though the issue affects any
operating system on the machine).
Has anyone heard more about this from IBM or know of some
way to disable the whitelist checking? It's really a shame
to not be able to use the nice builtin antennas in these
laptops with newer Mini-PCI cards (like the a/b/g combo that
IBM themselves make, which is still "unauthorized" on both
my X31 and T30 with latest BIOS) and instead be forced to
waste a PCMCIA slot and not get as good a signal.
Any information anyone has on this, is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
