HA is half of the key. Fast fsck is the other half. You can't avoid
the fact that the OS scribbling on your dual-ported disks is a single
point of failure. After that, do you really want to bring up a backup
computer without an fsck?
Tastes great AND less filling. Ice cream AND pudding. Fast fsck is
good no matter how you slice it. Why are we having this "discussion"
at all?
