yeah, wholeheartedly agreed, and this is what x86.git is heading 
towards. All test feedback so far is positive. With strong tools like 
bisection there's no reason why we couldnt approach it this way. If this 
change breaks anything, it will be bisected down to the patch below. In 
fact even io_delay=udelay would be wrong because any problem will be 
less clearly triggerable and thus less bisectable/debuggable.

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
make io_delay=none the default. This is the first step towards removing 
all the legacy io-delay API uses.
