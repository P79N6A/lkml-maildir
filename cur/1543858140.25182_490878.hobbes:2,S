No.  I still see corruption on Suse with Reiser FS.  It's always very 
subtle (like the last block of a file doesn;t get copied or gets
corrupted.   We have been running our ftp server on ReiserFS, and as 
soon as I can get it moved back to ext3, we are doing so.
We have had a lot of issues with corrupted RPM files and builds on 
ReiserFS.  If you can get the files copied to the
FS ok, they seem to stay that way.  moving a lot of data with recursive 
copies seems troublesome and some of the files
seem to get the ends clipped off of them.
