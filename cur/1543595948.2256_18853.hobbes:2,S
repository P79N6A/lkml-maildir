Actually, what about specifying that your usermode app has to be
pagelocked?
Alternatively.... You *can* do disk I/O without interrupts. Just poll
your IDE controller. [I'm doing that on my velo.] Hopefully your timer
IRQ is not shared with usermode app, then :-( [but that's almost
impossible on PCs, right?].
