Indeed. Until Linux has support for the Sega Dreamcast
NetBSD is still the system of choice for ultra-cheap
CPU power ;)

Indeed. It would be so good for everybody if the Linux
developers and the developers from the 4 BSDs would talk
to each other more and develop good ideas together, in a
friendly competition with each other ...
[With the design of the new VM, we had a lot of help from
Matt Dillon - who made the FreeBSD VM - and we're of course
giving back any ideas we come across so FreeBSD VM can be
improved too. It is my personal hope that both Linux and
FreeBSD VM will raise the bar for virtual memory management
a little bit over the next year or so.]
regards,
Rik
