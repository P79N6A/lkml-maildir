Yes, but please no.
My current tree says
	asmlinkage void preempt_schedule(void)
	{
	        if (unlikely(preempt_get_count()))
	                return;
	        if (current->state != TASK_RUNNING)
	                return;
	        schedule();
	}
and if people start getting latency problems due to loops with state != 
TASK_RUNNING, then I suspect we might just make "set_current_state()" 
check that case explicitly and do a conditional reschedule (ie make it the 
same as if we released a lock). That would be a hell of a lot cleaner, in 
my opinion.
