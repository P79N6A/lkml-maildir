Most of the threading changes have been things like 1 thread per cpu, which
would seem to scale up and down rather well to me ... could you illustrate
by  pointing  to an example of something that's changed in that area which
you think is bad? Yes, if Linux started 2000 kernel threads on a UP system,
that would obviously be bad.
