> I know mj has checkpoint/restart utility _working_ in user space.
   One day I wrote 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/mj/linux/freezer-0.0-pre2.tar.gz
which is a simple checkpoint/restart utility completely in userspace, but it
lacks several important features like saving/restoring of FPU registers
and signal handler.
   Some weeks later Ondrej Filip <feela@ipex.cz> has filled in the missing
bits. His version is available at 
ftp://ftp.ipex.cz/pub/local/feela/src/freezer.tgz.
				Have a nice fortnight
