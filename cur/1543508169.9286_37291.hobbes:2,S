Thanks for the details about the "fork bomb". (Ref: Prashant TR -
August 31st, 1999).
I HAVE TWO PROBLEMS/BUGS:
PROBLEM/BUG 1: (INIT 7, 8 AND 9)
I type init 7 and the system doesn't shutdown properly. This is true
with init 8 and init 9 as well. Is this a bug ? If yes, can something
be done about that ?
PROBLEM/BUG 2: (KERNEL CRASH)
I found a way to reproduce the crash which I mentioned on August 31st,
1999. I was playing DOOM and the system crashed. Well, nothing worked.
I even typed "init 0" blindly thinking that the screen was in the SVGA
mode but the console was actually active. But it wasn't so. The SCROLL
LOCK turned on and I could not do anything about it.
	I have a strange feeling that it has something to do with the
SCROLL LOCK or the keyboard handling.
HERE'S HOW I REPRODUCE THE CRASH. IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
I really don't know how many versions of DOOM you have for Linux. But
the one I'm talking about is the one that appeared with the Red Hat
Linux 6.0 on the CHIP Special Magazine (August Edition). Maybe, you
could get it from 
http://www.chip-india.com
. The sources for DOOM are
available on the same CD, so I guess that should help you fix the bug
more easily.
Basically, I run the file "rundoom". "rundoom" itself spawns several
processes and finally "doom" comes up.
I then switch to another console where I login as "root". I say
"ps -a" which gives me the PID of "rundoom". I then say "kill <pid of
rundoom>" and then switch to the console where I'm playing doom. The
moment I press the "up arrow", the system hangs. And that's it. I only
have to reset my system - everything else fails. This doesn't happen
if I kill another process "sdoom" which is spawned by the program.
I mentioned in my previous mail that it was probably SVGALIB that
caused the problem. But, could it be a bug in the CPU itself ? - I have
no idea. I can only reproduce the bug at present.
If this doesn't crash your system, I can get you a copy of the
doom executables, except the WAD file which is too massive. I will
put them up on my website if requested so that you could download
them. If any other details regarding this are needed, please send me a
mail. I kindly request you to wait for my response if needed as. It may
take
two to three days as I don't have a net connection myself.
