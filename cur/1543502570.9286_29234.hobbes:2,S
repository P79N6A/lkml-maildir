You can do this by calling mmap() and then starting a thread to access a
byte from each page sequentially.
Or you can do it by calling mmap() and then starting a thread to read()
a byte at inter-page offsets.  This is probably faster because the
kernel does readahead.
If you want exactly the same results as read, use MAP_PRIVATE and have
the reader thread read-then-write, to make local copies of the pages.
disclaimer: I've never done this.
