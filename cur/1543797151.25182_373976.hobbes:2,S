	Well, the burning question is : Is it possible to include your
Atheros driver in the Linux kernel ? Meaning, will it be released, and
will it contain a binary blob ?
	If we can't put it in the kernel, it does not bring any thing
new comapre to MadWifi.

	Precisely, which is why I've been pushing as many driver as I
can in the kernel, so that the need is clear and obvious.

	Not cool. I usually don't like wrapper, but would it be
possible to wrap the IPW API around DeviceScape ?

	It's old, but because it's the only current card properly
supported under Linux, most people are still using it. And you have
many original Prism2 designs that you can't find with other chipset,
such as the high power version and the CF cards.

	Well, the problem is that the more we wait, the more people
are going in other directions. Driver authors are voting with their
feets. I personally welcome your contribution, and I must admit I
don't really know what is the best course of action.
