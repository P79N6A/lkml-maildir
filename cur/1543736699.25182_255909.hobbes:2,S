Yes, you have multiple options to get Linux on it (flash the BIOS with
cromwell, grub-based bootloader, alter some of its current software,
etc).
The reason why the Xbox-Linux folks and I think it should belong in
the main tree is adoption. Xbox Linux has been around since 2001 if I
remember correctly and there are almost no distributions around that
really support the Xbox. The people at Debian for example will only
add Xbox support if it is available in the main tree.
