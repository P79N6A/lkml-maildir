Will this not run afoul of lockdep since it will be attempting to take
locks before lockdep has initialized?
(as an aside, it would be nice if it came after setup_arch, since on
some horrible platforms, printk_time needs the fpu turned on for
(integer) division, but there's no arch hook before the first printk, so
one needs to hijack the start_kernel entrypoint...)
