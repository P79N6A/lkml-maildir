Seems that the code is not modifying x86 code but all code. 
An app should be getting an out of memory error and not a SIGBUS when 
running out of memory.
I thought we fixed the SIGBUS problems and were now reporting out of 
memory? If there still is an issue then we better fix out of memory 
handling. Provide a way for the app to trap OOM conditions?
