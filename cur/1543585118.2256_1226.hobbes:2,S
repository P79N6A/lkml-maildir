The problem is that mmap_sem seems to be protecting the list
of VMAs, so taking _only_ the page_table_lock could let a VMA
change under us while a page fault is underway ...
Then again, I guess just making mmap_sem a R/W lock should fix
our problems ... and maybe even make it possible (in 2.5?) to
let multithreaded programs have pagefaults at the same time,
instead of having all threads queue up behind mmap_sem.

Rik
