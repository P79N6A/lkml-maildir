The reason it improves performance is, IMO, that this eliminates a useless
memory copy and the kernel caching that may have adverse effects for such
applications instead of optimizing IO througput.
It is not a real optimization, in my opinion, we just need to eliminates 
kernel IO optimizations since they are defeated by the way DB are doing 
IOs from user-land.
Implementing data caching from user-land may have the following cost, IMO:
- It increases the actual IO latency from the application to the device.
- Due to the increase of latency, you may need to use large caching and 
  complex optimization algorithms/heuritics in order not to be too bad.
  This wastes memory and CPU.
Using synchronous writes may reduce the average number of SCSI sommands 
the drive will be fed with at a time and so prevents the drive from 
optimizing IO based on actual head and angular positions.
If you want not to be too bad you may also need to implement some complex 
thing for that in user-land that also wastes resources.
The lower the IO latency is, the less you need complex caching and complex 
optimization heuristics to implement.
If you add on top of a data base manager some usually bad application
implemented by programmers that donnot have any idea on how the thing
actually works and you get something that need several order of magnitude
more ressources than traditional applications.
In order to make things still worse, you may add a RAID controller at the 
bottom of that pile of **** that still may increase significantly the
actual IO latency.

Agreed, I did mention that too.

Indeed, this may help.
