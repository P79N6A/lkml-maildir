Ok, so they don't really affect Makefiles / sources (and thus builds).
In that case I'd suggest that let's please change the names of such
menuconfig options from CONFIG_ to CONFIG_MENU_, otherwise
we really screw the text-based "make oldconfig" folks who think
that they're taking a build-related (and not presentation-related)
decision when confronted with a:
Ethernet (1000 Mbit) (NETDEV_1000) [Y/n] (NEW)
kind of option. OTOH:
Ethernet (1000 Mbit) (MENU_NETDEV_1000) [Y/n] (NEW)
taxes a make-oldconfig-using-person's intuition a little less, IMHO.
So this'll hopefully take care of Tilman's and Stefan's gripes:

This kind of promise was really nice, and why I liked Jan's
menuconfig patches a lot.
But if:

is true, then are we really gaining much from these configmenu's?
[unrelated]
I wish these new constructs were called "configmenu" and
_not_ "menuconfig". It causes confusion with the "menuconfig"
master Makefile rule which has nothing to do with these new
"configmenu"s.

I do agree that anything non-essential (even if it's just a presentation
menu that doesn't affect builds) must be default n.

IMHO, the real problem with "default y" menuconfig's, is that they
cause unpleasant surprises to those folks that use the text-based
"make oldconfig". They get confronted with choices that they never
bothered about (or even knew existed) previously, and have no
idea how to answer them -- same problem faced by Tilman, when
he used oldconfig.

IMHO, those using "oldconfig" are often looking towards doing
things quickly ... doesn't help them if they have default y menu's
that they need to "?" upon then to see what they're really about.

I think what happened here is that Jan really only considered the
"make menuconfig" users with these new constructs (which makes life
really simple for them), but "oldconfig" users were unfortunately in for
unpleasant surprises ...

Kernel dev's can still try, can't they ;-) I do agree that Kconfig is
primarily a build dependency language, but also, note that linking
Kconfig dependency rules with presentation isn't an idea that seems
to be fundamentally broken or anything.
Just my 2 paise,
