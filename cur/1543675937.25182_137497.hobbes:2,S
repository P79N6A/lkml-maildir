recently (27.05.03) I submitted some "oops messages" together with the
setup of the PC, attached you'll find some more...
The first happened after connecting to an ISP via ISDN, the second followed
the first one after some more messages:

May 31 23:53:43 DE-BC4243 kernel: kill_fasync: bad magic number in
fasync_struct!
May 31 23:53:59 DE-BC4243 kernel: sock_release: fasync list not empty!
