hmm ... sorry for writing without checking. it's true that
as complains. but for e.g. nasm, it's no problem at all.
e.g. if you consider this example:
bash-2.05# cat test.nasm 
bits    32
section .text
        mov     eax,ds
        mov     ds,eax
bash-2.05# nasm -f elf test.nasm 
bash-2.05# objdump -d test.o
test.o:     file format elf32-i386
Disassembly of section .text:
00000000 <.text>:
   0:   8c d8                   movl   %ds,%eax
   2:   8e d8                   movl   %eax,%ds
of course, it's still not possible to move 32 bits into a segreg,
so what? the processor will silently ignore the upper word, I guess.
(my ix86 handbook is in the office, so I can't look it up).
so, this probably means that it's *not* the linux kernel which contains
wrong code, but as from binutils-2.16 is being to restrictive when
doing sanity checking, agreed?
best regards,
