Though I might be misunderstanding something, my understanding is
that this implies that there can be more MSI-X table entries than
number of interrupts, and PME/HotPlug or AER interrupts can be
mapped to other than first two entries. If my understanding is
correct, your patch would not work if PME/HotPlug or AER interrupts
were mapped to other than first two.
Regardless of my understanding is correct or not, I have another
concern. I think there are two interrupts for PCIe port service
currently as your patch indicates. But new interrupts can be added
in the future. With the assumption, PME/HotPlug and/or AER interrupts
would not work if the first several entries are mapped to other new
interrupts. Therefore, with the assumption, we need to fix MSI-X
initialization code whenever new interrupts are defined.

Please see above mentioned my concerns.

Though the patch is not tested with MSI-X capable ports, I think it
is much better than the current code.
