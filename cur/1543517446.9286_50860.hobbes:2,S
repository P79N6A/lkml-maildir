Subject: Not too late to submit papers to the Freenix track!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While the official Freenix CFP listed the deadline for the submission of
1-3 page abstracts for the Freenix as being yesterday (Monday, November
29), since other web pages listed the deadline as being this Friday
(December 3rd), so the submission deadline has been moved to Friday.
So, it's not too late to submit a proposal for a paper to the Freenix
track.  Linux developers are well represented on the program committee,
but unfortunately, Linux hasn't been that well represented as far as
submissions are concerned.  So if you have some idea that you've been
working on, write a 1-3 page abstract and send it in!  (It doesn't take
long to write something up.)

FREENIX is a special track within the USENIX Annual Technical
Conference.  USENIX encourages the exchange of information and
technologies between the commercial UNIX products and the free software
world as well as among the various free operating system alternatives.
FREENIX is the showcase for the latest developments and interesting
applications in freely redistributable software. The FREENIX forum
includes Apache, FreeBSD, GNOME, GNU, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Samba, and
more. The FREENIX track attempts to cover the full range of software
which is freely redistributable in source code form and provides
pointers to where the code can be found on the Internet. Marshall Kirk
McKusick is serving as FREENIX program chair. FREENIX attendees also
attend all of the USENIX Conference offerings and informal
get-togethers.
Submissions to the refereed track are expected to represent mature work
for which the authors are ready to fully describe the background, new
ideas, experiments, and results of their work. By contrast, the FREENIX
track seeks to gather reports on projects that are underway, but not yet
finished. The purpose for the FREENIX papers is not as an archival
reference, but rather a place to let others know about the project on
which you are working and to provide a forum from which to expand your
user base. We are looking for talks which advance the state of the art
of freely redistributable software or otherwise provide useful
information to those faced with deploying (and "selling") free software
in the field.
Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: 
	Operating system design 
	Network design and implementation 
	File system design 
	Highly-available systems 
	Highly-scalable systems 
	Graphical user interface tools 
	Desktop metaphors 
	File and print systems 
	System management tools 
	Security 
	Large scale system management 
	Interesting deployments of free software 
	How free software is being developed and managed today 
Interesting applications of freely redistributable software might include: 
	Robotics and automation 
	Clustering 
	Wearable computers 
	Embedded systems 
	High-speed networking 
	Studio graphics 
	Audio processing 
Submission of a one to three page abstract is due by December 3, 1999.
