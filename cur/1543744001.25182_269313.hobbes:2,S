Actually, this part of the patch is bogus. If our "put_task_struct" is the
last one, it doesn't help at all that we're insidfe the tasklist_lock. 
We'll just release the task structure ourselves.
The problem remains, though: "do_wait()" does end up accessing "tsk" in
	tsk = next_thread(tsk);
and as far as I can see, "tsk" may be gone by then.
Is there anything else protecting us? This looks like a serious (if 
extremely unlikely) bug..
Anyway, here's an updated patch for Sripathi's original problem, with a 
better comment, and with the put_task_struct back where it was originally 
since it shouldn't matter.
Help me, Obi-Wan McGrath,
		Linus
