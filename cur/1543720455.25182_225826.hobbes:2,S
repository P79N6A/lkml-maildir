Please no. It was this way in 2.4.x, and I was receiving at least
two complaints a week that their G450 does not work with their
system.
G400's second head has nothing to do with G450/G550, so there is
no reason why G400 second head should set FB_MATROX_G450...
If anything, then let's remove G100/G200/G400 choice completely,
making G450/G550 support unconditional.
