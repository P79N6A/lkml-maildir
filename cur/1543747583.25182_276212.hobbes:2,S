It's different from an external API exactly because it's not "external". 
I dunno about you, but the (admittedly few) explicitly object-oriented 
projects I've seen from the inside, the class interface is something that 
you consider internal to your project, and are willing to change.
In Linux, the VFS layer comes pretty close: it's really very much about
object-oriented programming, except the implementation is explicit rather
than left up to the programmer. And we have very explicit rules on how
you're supposed to do things: some are even _documented_ (oh, horrors) in
Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt.
And yes, in this kind of environment I actually think "contract" makes 
some kind of sense, because it is an internal thing that _has_ come out of 
agreement on both sides, and where changes need to be agreed upon by both 
user and definition. It's not an a-priori interface, it's something where 
both sides are intimately involved.

Yes. And I think it makes sense _internally_ for a project. 
But pretty much by definition, that's not an ABI. That's an "internal 
interfaces" kind of thing.

It may also be a new thing. Dammit, when I started, we had USCD Pascal,
and we were happy. None of this OO stuff ;)
