You may have different boot loaders (or none at all).
You also may have different storage media like FlashRAM, IDE,
network, .... for boot loader/kernel/root filesystem. They may have
different sizes and it makes a "little" difference for your requirements
in the toolchain if you have 4MB or 1GB to boot your system from.
All that kind of information can be found in a BSP (board support
package).
