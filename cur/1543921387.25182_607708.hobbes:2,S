At least for the unlocked_ioctl case this is not nessecary because
the driver an simply set both the unlocked_ioctl and compat_ioctl
handlers to the same function.  For the drivers not using unlocked_ioctl
yet a function like this makes sense in theory, but I'd prefer to
just switch them to ->unlocked_ioctl.
