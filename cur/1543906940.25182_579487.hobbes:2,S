Subject: Re: [PATCH][RESEND] Fix a potential NULL pointer deref in the aic7xxx, ahc_print_register() function
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

All of this logic was simplified back in '05 in the BSD drivers by adding
this to the top of the function:
        u_int   dummy_column;
        if (cur_column == NULL) {
                dummy_column = 0;
                cur_column = &dummy_column;
        }
and then stripping out the cur_column == NULL checks in the routine.
