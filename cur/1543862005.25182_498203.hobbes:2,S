FWIW, the patches have got a lot less invasive and I was pleased with
the way the last set I posted worked out. 
1/4 is a lot of noise adding the page parameter to swap_free but doesn't
actually change much. 
2/4 is the guts of the solution in the form of two new functions. 
3/4 just hooks it in. 
4/4 is an optional cleanup.
I guess the key point for me is that the lack of proper handling of this
was bringing one of my systems to its knees due to IO loops before these
patches. Yes, there are ways to minimise the impact but why not fix it
properly? This proposal is certainly nowhere near as invasive as the
previous ones and since its got this far...

Maybe, I haven't made my mind up about that yet. I'd have to see how the
code looked I guess.
Cheers,
