What can't we do?   We've already worked with the drivers to quesce the 
hardware and put any information to resume the device in ram.  Now we 
ask them to put their device in low power mode so we can go to sleep.  
Even if we schedule, the only thing userspace could touch is memory.   
If we resume, they just run those computations again.

The advantage is we don't have to come up with a way to teach drivers 
"wake up to run these requests, but no other requests".  We don't have 
to figure out what we need to resume to allow them to process a 
request.

For those that don't find it acceptable they can teach their bootloader

Requiring the hibernated kernel to be able to start from kexec should 
not be bad.   If you were referring to adding kboot, that is just an 
option.
One can still use bootloaders menus to select alternate kernels.   
However, as you said, you want to boot differently for resume (no acpi 
until after image loaded) from full boot.

Feel free to list other problems with the freezer, but I'm saying that 
the problems are stemming from trying to freeze most of userspace and 
some selection of kernel threads so that new requests to the outside 
are not made, but then turning around and saying "ok now do some io, 
but only what this thread of execution originates".  Its originates not 
generates so we are trying to teach the whole stack these limits, 
including going back to userspace for FUSE.

In other words, I'm replacing a course-grained solution with an 
absolute solution.  "From this point on you can only write to ram."

I actually listed three ways to start.  Not all of them required 
dm-snapshot.  I was proposing "if you need to read ext3, then use 
dm-snapshot".

not on ones mounted read-only.   I'll reply more later in the thread.

Hmm... I didn't say how to reduce the memory or identify it, did I?
Ok fine.   I'll allocate a bunch of memory and put it on a list.  
Normal memory pressure will swap things out or drop filesystem pages.   
When I build the list of memory to backup, I filter out this list.  
After resume, I'll free it back.
We can arrange for this "task" to be preferred by the oom killer, if 
case the user is trying to suspend into  less than memory than can be 
freed.

How do any of those methods require userpsace to know anything about 
hibernation?   I was talking about a general framework consistent with 
todays kernel to user communication for those parts of userspace that 
*want* to know about suspend and hibernation.

Yea, so?  We have a full kernel and userspace, adding compression 
before writing should be easy.  The is no struct page for memory in the 
old kernel, so we likely need to be copying them in userspace anyways.  
Adding compression should be easy.

Ok ... this only supports uncompressed hibernation?
The first kernel is going to specify (1) what to backup.  It can 
specify (2) where to backup, although we have to be careful identify 
the device in a persistent way.

The problem I'm saying kexec solves is how to get the data to the 
device while most of the kernel is trying not do anything permanent.
If we can reuse existing code, great.

What state are you referring to?
Yes, there is state that the drivers have to store to ram, but this the 
same state they need to store when suspending to ram if the device can 
be powered off.
Maybe we need to teach drivers to store more state, like remember that 
a hard drive was spun down.
So we may need a flag saying "we powered off", "we resumed from 
suspend".

If the save kernel is different from the run kernel (to make it 
smaller), its likely the image saving code will move.  I view restoring 
from a different kernel than saving as an advanced feature.
Lets get resuming from the save kernel working first.
