Why isn't modutils looking through *all* directories ?
I can understand the need/desire to have a few special ones, but
any other directory should be recognized as a `misc' to avoid
having to upgrade your modutils for each change in the dir structure.
The same problem happened with `nls' and probably others.
Especially since all the modules have distinct names anyway
(don't they all end up in /usr/src/linux/modules at compilation?)
