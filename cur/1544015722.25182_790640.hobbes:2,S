They haven't been implemented yet.  They've been discussed on the ext4
mailing list, however.  Basically, the Orlov algorithm was disabled
for flex_bg, and I want to optimize how directory blocks are allocated
to hopefully speed up fsck times a tad bit more.  The design has been
roughly worked out; but it's a matter of me finding time to code and
test it...
