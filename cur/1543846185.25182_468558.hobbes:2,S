Dear all!
I have the following problem with wpa supplicant/ipw3945. First the
versions:
kernel:	2.6.18-mm2	(self compiled)
ieee80211:	1.1.14
ipw3945:	git source
ipw3945d:	1.7.19
wpa supplicant:	0.5.5	(Debian/unstable 0.5.5-1)
Config file of wpa_supplicant:
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
eapol_version=1
ap_scan=1
network={
        ssid="norbunet"
        key_mgmt=NONE
        auth_alg=SHARED
        wep_key0=HEXKEY1
        wep_key1=HEXKEY2
        wep_key2=HEXKEY3
        wep_key3=HEXKEY4
        wep_tx_keyidx=0
        priority=5
}
When I start ipw3945d and wpa_supplicant it does not connect. And the
reason is that when typing
	iwconfig eth2
(eth0 cable, eth1 not present!?!, eth2 ipw3945) I see that the ESSID is
set to
	"norbune"
instead of
	"norbunet"
Calling
	iwconfig eth2 essid "norbunet "
(mind the space at the end) immediately connects (even with encryption)
and everything is working.
Do you have any idea what this might be related to?
The last kernel I tried which worked out of the box (well, with
comnpiling ieee and ipw) was 2.6.18-rc4.
Best wishes
Norbert
