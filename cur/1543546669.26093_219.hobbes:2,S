SuS v2 saith:
  A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked region
  is put to sleep by attempting to lock another process' locked region. If
  the system detects that sleeping until a locked region is unlocked would
  cause a deadlock, fcntl() will fail with an [EDEADLK] error.
