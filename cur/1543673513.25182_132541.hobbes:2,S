    They should show up under /sys/block/<dev> (after mounting
    sysfs on /sys).
    
    Rick, were you working on some docs for this?
    or are some already available?
I was working at something for Documentation/ describing the fields,
but disk I/O stats disappeared from /proc/stat quite a while ago --
basically at the same time they appeared in sysfs.
Since apparently the interest in this trivia :) continues, I'll bump the
priority and submit a file for Documentation/ by the end of the week.
Clemens, if your need is urgent, drop me a line and I can send you a
less polished description sooner.
Rick
