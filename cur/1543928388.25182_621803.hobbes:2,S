Subject: [PATCH] x86/paravirt: revert exports to restore old behaviour
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Subdividing the paravirt_ops structure caused a regression in certain
non-GPL modules which try to use mmu_ops and cpu_ops.  This restores
the old behaviour, and makes it consistent with the
non-CONFIG_PARAVIRT case.

Christoph Hellwig objects to this patch on the grounds that modules
shouldn't be using these operations anyway.  I don't think this is a
particularly good reason to reject the patch, for several reasons:
1. These operations are still available to modules when not using
   CONFIG_PARAVIRT, since they are implicitly exported as inline
   functions via the kernel headers.  Exporting the same functionality as
   GPL-only symbols just adds a gratuitious difference between
   CONFIG_PARAVIRT and non-CONFIG_PARAVIRT configurations.  If we really
   think these operations are not for module use (or non-GPL module use),
   then we should solve the problem in a general way.
2. It's a regression from previous kernels, which would work these
   modules even with CONFIG_PARAVIRT enabled.
3. The operations in question seem pretty reasonable for modules to
   use.  The control registers/MSRs can be accessed directly anyway, so there's
   no benefit in preventing modules from using standard interfaces.  And it seems
   reasonable to allow a graphics driver to create its own mappings if it wants.
Therefore, I think this patch should go in for 2.6.24.  If people
really think that these operations should not be available to modules,
then we can address that separately.
