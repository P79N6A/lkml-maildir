Another interesting tid-bit is that xcdroast, which is a graphic front
to cdrecord, detects with 2.2.1 my CD devices only when are some media
inside.  This is not required for a correct detection with 2.0.3x series
of kernels.  Probably related to reported early failures of 'eject'
on empty drives.  I did not investigate yet.
It seems like all kind of installation programs which try to detect
available devices will be for interesting times.  Was this change
in a behaviour dictated by some overriding concern or this is simply
an oversight?
