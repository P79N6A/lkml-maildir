Ingo claims the problem was trivial since the patches were trivial.
But fact is they aren't trivial - as you can e.g. see on Ingos patch 
that started this thread, and that was for the completely wrong place.

And what do you want to do in such a case?
Kconfig is a user interface, and we actually need such cases you want to 
warn for for getting a good UI.
We already know what can cause problems.
But as far as I know there are no such problems users actually ran into 
in recent stable kernels - and most of the problems (like the one in 
this thread) are pathological cornercases you only see with randconfig.
