Okay, so "locking the kernel" is really a misnomer.  It doesn't lock the
whole kernel, just the sections protected by the kernel lock; and there's
nothing more magical about the kernel lock than any other spinlock, it
just protects more stuff.  Got it.
Thanks to all who replied for clarifying this.
