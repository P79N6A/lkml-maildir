hello,
i haven't been on lkml since vger died, but just subscribed and looked
at the archives and was unable to find anything on this...
i'm running 2.4.0-test9 and 2.2.18-pre15.  for both of these kernels, if
i enable usb and smp, i get a lot of usb device timeout errors.  if i
recompile, just disabling smp, the usb devices work fine.
i'm using a tyan tiger 133 (1854d, i believe) mobo (via apollo pro 133a
chipset).  this is with both redhat 6.2 and 7.0 (thought it might be gcc
2.96, but it seems to happen with both).  i also tried both the normal
UHCI and JE's UHCI drivers, but there's no change.
any ideas?
any more information i can provide to help?
thanks,
pete
