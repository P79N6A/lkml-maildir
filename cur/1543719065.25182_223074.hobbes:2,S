OK thanks... I think I even wrote that :P
The problem is smp_num_siblings is set to 2, but phys_proc_id
doesn't seem to be set up right (or it could be cpu_callout_map).
That would cause the sched-domains to get set up wrong, sure. Maybe
we should just go bug in this case? Or try to fix up?
Anyone have any idea why this is happening?
