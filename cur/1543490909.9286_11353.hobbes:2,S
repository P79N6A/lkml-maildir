Performance optimization is 15% brains, 85% black magic. I could easily
imagine that in many conditions, the extra locked-down free buffers
improve performance by making a pool of quick-allocation free buffers
available, even at the expense of other things.

I said they were unlikely..
Basically, the only real case I can imagine where this actually could
result in serious problems is:
 - write a large file that fills much of your memory because you're not
   doing anything else.
 - remove the file.
 - start applications that do _not_ do any writes to the filesystem, but
   use lots of memory other ways..

Indeed. Leaving the b_count at an elevated number may give you some of
that advantage, but it's definitely not something I want to count on for
good behaviour..
