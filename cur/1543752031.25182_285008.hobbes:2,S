Hi Simone,

OK, thanks for the update anyway. Please note that what I mainly need
now if a dump of your IT87xxF chip before ever loading the it87 driver.
As explained in a previous mail, you can obtain such a dump by running
"isadump 0x295 0x296". isadump is part of the lm_sensors package [1].

When I get this, I'll compare with the datasheets so as to understand
how your chip is configured (or left unconfigured) by your BIOS. This
will both help me propose a workaround in the it87 driver and explain
the Gigabyte support what I think they should do.
Thanks,
