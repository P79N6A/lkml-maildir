Subject: Console Goes Blank When Booting 2.6.15-rc5

As Jesper Juhl has reported, if I boot 2.6.15-rc5 with vga=normal,
everything is fine. If I boot using my preferred size (vga=794),
the console goes blank. Because I'm a touch typist, I can login and
start X and everything is copacetic, but as soon as I leave X, I'm
back to the blank screen. From X, if I flip over to a VC, the VC
display is garbled and has artifacts from the X display.
This worked fine with 2.6.14.3, and I didn't change the console, 
framebuffer, or vesa options between the two kernels. Not sure how 
to proceed, but I sure would like my high res console screens back.
Thanks,
Kurt
