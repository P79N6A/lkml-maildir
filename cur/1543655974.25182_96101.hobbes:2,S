Since a symlink is just a file containing a name, the resulting path
length is simply the maximum path length that user-space tools allow.
This should be defined as "PATH_MAX". Posix defines this as 255 characters
but I think posix requires that this be the minimum and all file-name
handling buffers must be at least PATH_MAX in length.
A hard link is just another directory-entry for the same file. This,
therefore follows the same rules. There must be enough space on the
device to contain the number of directory entries, as well as enough
buffer length in the tools necessary to manipulate these "nested"
directories, which are not really "nested" at all.
