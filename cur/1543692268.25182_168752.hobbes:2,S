The link mentioned quotes me as saying that the BCM4300 series of wireless 
chips has excellent support on the MIPS architecture, which indeed it does. 
Unfortunately, what they don't mention is that the source for that driver was 
not, and has not been released by Linksys or Broadcom.  Also, the binary 
driver is only available in the firmware of networking products, like the 
WRT54G, using Broadcom wireless chips.
Hopefully, I'll have some more information to post here about that in the 
coming few days.
