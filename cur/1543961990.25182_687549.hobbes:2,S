I violently agree.
One of the (obvious?) ways in which we can raise the quality of the code
overall is to spend more time on reviewing the others' code and discussing that
code.  It follows from my experience that the quality of patches improves
dramatically if they are discussed while being developed.  Of course, that
requires time, but it's time well spent.
For this reason, there should be a mechanism in place that will encourage
people to review the existing code, even the code that hasn't changed for
a long time, and to review and discuss patches submitted by the other people
instead of producing new code.
Also, the patches that were thoroughly discussed during their development
should be regarded as more trustworthy than the ones that were not discussed
at all.
