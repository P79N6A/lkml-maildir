Hello, I have a test program  which will generate the Oops easily.
No maintainer was listed for tmpfs and the best Google reference is
about 2 years back, and it does not seem to be about this issue.
This Oops both 2.4.22 and 2.6.0-test11
It results from a ARCH=um bugreport and I kept making the
test program shorter, now down to one executable line.
It oops with the list poison address on 2.6.0-test11
Neither myself nor William Lee Irwin III know what the
list_del(q);
list_add(q, &dentry->d_subdirs);
from fs/libfs.c:90 or 137 is intended to do but he suggested you might
know
I think that is where it is corrupting the list entries.

/* test2 program to Oops shmfs mounted at /dev/shm */
/* yes it is dumb but unprivileged users should not be able */
/* to Oops the kernel regardless of how dumb the program */
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <dirent.h>
main()
{/* off 0 is "." off 1 is ".." off 2 is empty */
        seekdir(opendir("/dev/shm"), (off_t) 2);
}
