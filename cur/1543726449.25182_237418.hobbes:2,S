I was going to do an exhaustive test, but because my computer stopped
running completely, I'll reply to the one or two bits I can now.

Well, I noticed a max of 6500 interrupts/s on eth1 on both computers, with or
without napi - and that 6500 is also the figure of packets per second.
So I'm slightly dubious. (notice 6500 *1500 bytes is about 10MB/s)

Thanks. That wasn't the problem - the line speed's a gbit.

No messages, no oops, no log messages that I noticed. 
It was video memory corruption in text mode.
As to the rest, I'll do it when I revive my computer. Right now, I'm
thinking the power supply may be dodgy. I'll see if I can get
a minimum to run off my even older 235Watt. But as a note,
with two cards, two cdroms and a hard drive less, it was still
making the noise. I think it still is now, but since no OS actually
boots completely right now, I can't say for sure.
I'll do a memtest, that makes sense.
