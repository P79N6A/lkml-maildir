Not cgroups, no. If you really wanted to extend cpusets specifically
to allow irqs to be assigned to a cpuset to control which cpus they
could execute on, then that might be a possibility. But I don't see
how this would be useful for any other cgroup subsystem, so it doesn't
belong in the generic framework.
My feeling is that just using a simple bitmask assignment, unrelated
to cpusets or cgroups, as Max suggested in his later email is the way
to go.
