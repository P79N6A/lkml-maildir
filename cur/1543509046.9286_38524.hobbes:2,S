Hi -
Another UK user reported that mounting Amiga RDSK (aka RDB) partitioned
devices using CONFIG_AMIGA_PARTITION functionality made his kernel Oops.
I have reproduced this behaviour locally using an RDSK partitioned Zip disc
in a drive attached to an ava-1505 (aha152x.c) SCSI controller, but get no Oops.
He was using kernel 2.2.12 (and has tried 2.2.5-15 to 2.3.15) on a dual P2 233
machine. I tried on 2.2.10ac10 and, just now, 2.2.13pre5 on my P2 266. It
used to work for me around 2.0.35.
Basically, on a mount attempt, the kernel spews a lot of stuff to the console
and hangs or reboots. I tried mounting / synchronously and kept
syslogd/klogd running in the hope that that would capture it but it all
happens too fast. Looking at the kernel output though, it would appear to be
amiga_partition() in linux/drivers/block/genhd.c that's misbehaving.
How can I get some debug info logged to disc before the kernel hangs? Do I
need to resort to putting busy loops in amiga_partition() to slow the
console output?!
Best Regards,
Alex.
