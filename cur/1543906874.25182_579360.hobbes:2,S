As a data point: I've got the same drive w/ same revision in my laptop and 
haven't had any NCQ errors pop up. Currently running 2.6.23-rc2.
 ata1.00: ATA-8: FUJITSU MHW2120BH, 00000012, max UDMA/100
 ata1.00: 234441648 sectors, multi 16: LBA48 NCQ (depth 0/32)
 ata1.00: configured for UDMA/100
Might be dependent on the controller and/or the driver. Got a nVidia MCP51 
using sata_nv here.
