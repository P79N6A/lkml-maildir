Well, we don't need anything particularly complicated--just a one-bit
flag on the superblock would be enough.

I can't think of any reason we would need to in the near future, but
maybe I'm insufficiently creative.
The use of a mount option means the change attribute could be
inconsistent across mounts.  If we really need this, wouldn't it make
more sense for it to be a persistent feature of the filesystem, set at
mkfs time?
