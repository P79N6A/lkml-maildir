More precisely:
	- The last working commit is b6dff3ec... "CRED: Separate task
	  security context from task_struct".
	- The first commit exhibiting the permissions problem is
	  a6f76f2... "CRED: Make execve() take advantage of
	  copy-on-write credentials".
	- The 9 commits in between (from f1752eec to d84f4f9) result in
	  a soft lookup on boot.
