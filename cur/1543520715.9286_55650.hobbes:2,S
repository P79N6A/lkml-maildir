Hello
I am running 2.3.35-pre6 on old dual pentiun166 computer. I have got
deadlock during the first night. Now I got this:
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000002
... APIC ESR1: 00000002
... bit 1: APIC Receive CS Error (hw problem).
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000002
... APIC ESR1: 00000002
... bit 1: APIC Receive CS Error (hw problem).
The kernel runs after this fine - but it ascares me - I am using netfilter
0.14 - root is on scsi adaptec 2940.
