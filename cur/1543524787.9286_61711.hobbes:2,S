Here's #2. This one contains a little more candy than the previous one,
even if it might not be as urgent. Some small fixes for obscure errors
has been included, together with a quite extensive updating of outdated
e-mail addresses to people in the MAINTAINERS/CREDITS-files, and some other
various stuff. I think everything here is totally unquestionable.
Oh, and apologies to Andrea _Arcangeli_ for misspelling his name in
the changelog that went out together with v2.0.39pre1.
As I've now updated both CREDITS and MAINTAINERS, I want everyone that
are maintainers/authors for stuff in v2.0.xx to have a look in these files
and see if their information checks out.
