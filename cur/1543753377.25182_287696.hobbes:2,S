Hi!
First, sorry about the so-so topic for the kernel developers...but still 
there are such things inside :)
Currently I am investigating how "they" divide those polynomials and 
which possibilities exists to use SIMD for such calculations. I have 
found several papers about how to do it with Altivec and my question is: 
does anybody knows about efforts to use Altivec for CRC calculations 
here? Topic itself is quite old...
Or is there just any other ongoing developments which implements for 
example permute/shuffle instructions (Altivec: vperm/SSE2: pshufd) for 
table lookups?
One more question: is there PCI/PCIe cards (eg. router) which implements 
Layer 3(-4) in hardware and which are possible to use as "hardware net 
accelerator"?
thanks,
Indrek
