I know that this is one of the problems of the driver. An even worse
problem is that on my rev 1 chip recording does not work.
Unfortunately, I don't know how to solve any of these problems without
the help of ESS. And ESS has been unwilling to help. Without help,
the best one can do is "shoot in the dark".
