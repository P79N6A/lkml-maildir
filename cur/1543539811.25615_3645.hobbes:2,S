Hi, 
I am having a really weired problem related to ether driver / PCI
subsystems.  Any pointers are appreciated.
machine : MIPS, (little endian)
kernel : from MIPS CVS tree, v2.4.0-test2
ether : RTL 8029 (SMC EZNET-PCI, NE2k compatible)
I am attempting to boot the system through NFS root FS, however, I
failed to see any packet sent out from the board.  What is strange is
that the board receives interrupts just fine.  And each time the
ipconfig_bootp_send_if() sends out a bootp packet, it actually receives
transmit interrupt as well!
I trace the stack, everything seems fine.  There is just no packet out. 
Does anybody have a clue here?  Or at least how should further probe the
problem?
Thanks in advance.
Jun
