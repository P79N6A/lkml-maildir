Indeed.
Iff you ever want to replace the above, make sure to do it like this:
    printk_info("Start... ");
    ...
    printkc_info("Ok!\n");
(with `printkc_info()' being a continuation of `printk_info()'. And do the same
for all other KERN_* variations. This would add real value, since the next step
is to make the printk{,c}_*() definitions conditionally empty for embedded
systems and/or systems with few memory.

P.S. The naming conventions above are purely hypothetical. I suggest we first
     have a few Holy Wars(tm) about them before settling :-)
