First of all I had applied patches up to patch-2.3.3 but the last 
patch 2.3.3 didn´t touch the linux/Makefile so my kernel seems to be 
2.3.2. It's compiled SMP.
Well after an uptime of a couple of hours I began to suffer some 
extrange things, first one xwindows app sudenly crashes without 
saying anything, then qps also joined the crew, and when I clicked in 
kpanel to shutdow the X it also disapeared, I close with Ctrl-Alt-
Bkspc and restarted, but kpanel also crahed.
I return to the console and when I did a uptime I obtained this:
 12:58am  up -24855 days, -3:-14,  3 users,  load average: 2.17, 
2.24, 2.21
Wich seems a bit odd to me, as it is:
  1:03am  up  2:13,  3 users,  load average: 2.86, 2.37, 2.25
This result was a bit random, sometimes was correct, and sometimes 
not, but the best result was:
  1:04am  up -24855 days, -3:-14,  3 users,  load average: NaN, 2.62, 
2.35
notice the NaN in the load.
But after this I did a df, and:
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hda6            2082193 1890950   126663  -2147483648%   /
This also seems a bit strange to me.
I don't know why the x apps crashed, because they didn't say goodbay 
nor anything else, but thats what I found at the console.
P.D. For those of linux-kernel, please cc me because I'm only in 
linux-smp.
Thanks.
