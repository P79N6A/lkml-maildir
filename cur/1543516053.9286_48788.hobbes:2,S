Don't have that.  After all, it's one of the old but terrific IBM
keyboards. ;)

 On x86   - You press the key combo 'ALT-SysRQ-<command key>'. Note - Some
            (older?) may not have a key labeled 'SysRQ'. The 'SysRQ' key is
            also known as the 'Print Screen' key.

 On SPARC - You press 'ALT-STOP-<command key>', I believe.
