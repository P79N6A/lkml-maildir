Many thanks.

No, I still hope these hangs are unrelated to these patches.
I am trying to find the bug, but I can't. May be it is because
I do not want to believe that these patches are buggy :)
I tried to stress them with various small tests I wrote and I
have not found any problems.
And I don't know what kernel you are using, there is additional
timer patch in mm2.
Oleg.
