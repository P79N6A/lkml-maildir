I don't know of any in-tree.  I was originally just looking at this code
while writing adjust_resource() and insert_resource() and noticed this
corner case.
But now, I was thinking about using the resource management code to handle
the PCI hotplug resource management (which currently is done independently
by each hotplug driver).  Since the drivers can be loaded independently
of everything under them, they'd need to use insert_resource() and
remove_resource() to avoid disturbing the child resources.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
