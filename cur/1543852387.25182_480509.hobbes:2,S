Subject: How to compile module params into kernel?

Instead of passing a module param on the cmdline I want to compile that
into
the kernel, but I can't figure out how.
The module param I want compile into kernel is
rtc-ds1307.force=0,0x68
This is for an embeddet target that doesn't have loadable module
support.
 Thanks
