In principle that works. But one of  things that's less nice with 
pthread_cond_wait is
that you sometimes have a (most of the time) unnecessary schedule 
ping-pong, and with the
approach above you always have this (due to ack). And secondly if 
futex_up(&f, N) for N > 1
relies on the chained wakeup in the kernels futex_up routine the 
broadcast may take a while to
complete (the lowest priority waiter penalizes all others queued behind 
him). A semaphore simply is no full replacement for a waitqueue with 
wake_all.

P.S.  With respect to pthreads I was not thinking of a bloated N:M 
library, but of some simple
fast pthread semantics compatible wrapper for _clone etc.
