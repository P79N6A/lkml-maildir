Expressing order in Makefile is a convenient way to express simple
ordering.  I think it's nice to keep it that way even if it doesn't
necessarily mean link order.  So, maybe we can do the reverse and make
built in modules follow module order regardless of actual link order
(say sort init table according to module order before final link).
Thanks.
