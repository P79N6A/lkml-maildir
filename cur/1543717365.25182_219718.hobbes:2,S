Subject: [PATCH] calculate NGROUPS_PER_BLOCK from PAGE_SIZE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On ia64, EXEC_PAGESIZE (max page size) is 65536, but the default page
size is 16k.  This results in NGROUPS_PER_BLOCK in include/linux/sched.h
being calculated incorrectly when the page size is anything other than
64k.  For example, on a 16k page size kernel, a setgroups() call with a
gidsetsize of 65536 will end up walking over memory since only 1/4 of
the needed pages were allocated for the blocks[] array in the group_info
struct.
Patch below calculates NGROUPS_PER_BLOCK from PAGE_SIZE instead.
