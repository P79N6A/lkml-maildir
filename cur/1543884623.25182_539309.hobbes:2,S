But then the sane limit is a number of pages, not "512 glyphs".
And there is no problem if the memory is allocated dynamically
when loading the font.  Americans may then load a 127-glyph
font without wasting memory.  And those who wish to lock down
5MB unswappable memory for a hi-res chinese console can do that too.
Doing so isn't really a problem on a desktop pc.
