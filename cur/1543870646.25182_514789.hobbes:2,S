Sure.
Mostly containers patch does 2 things:
1. user space interfaces (if people don't like system calls used in UBC
  we are fine with filesystems approach. why not?)
2. context handling
So (1) is ok with us.
(2) requires some more work to be done before we are fine.
Actually all we want is lockless context handling all over the code
and looks like it is clear how to do it. Good.
UBC on the other hand can provide containers subsystems, i.e.
memory and other resources accounting and limiting etc.
This is what we are working on right now.
Thanks,
Kirill
