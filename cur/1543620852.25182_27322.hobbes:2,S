 Yes. I saw this start happening in my tree when I merged 2.5.4pre2
 When I tried a 2.5.4pre2 vanilla, the problem was gone, so I put it
 down to a problem in my tree. When I rebooted back into it, the problem
 was gone. Aren't heisenbugs fun?
 Exactly the same symptoms, portmap borken, NIS/NFS subsequently fail.
 This was on x86 btw.
