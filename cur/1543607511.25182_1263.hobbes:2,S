True, it does have a paragraph or two at the end of each chapter on what
2.4 is including, but its still entirely a 2.2 book otherwise.  Also,
there is no 2E so I can understand the confusion.  On the other hand,
Linux Device Drivers does have a 2E, and it is 2.4 oriented.
Regardless, I think both books are great.
