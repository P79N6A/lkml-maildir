   Dave, I'd like to see the latter patch in the kernel.
Thanks a lot for doing the "right thing".  I'll look over your stuff
and put together something coherent after I perform some testing and
do a little more analysis of my own.
[ Pete's posting is an example of whan an ideal TCP bug report
  looks like, he did his homework and I wish others would too. ]
Later,
David S. Miller
