So the issues as I understand them:
  o some BIOSes are broken and don't properly map MCFG space (though
    according to Petr V. reserving MCFG space in e820 is optional, so
    the test may be slightly wrong as-is)
  o MCFG space is required for (many) PCIe devices (any regular PCI
    devices?)
  o often, there's nothing the user can do to address the points above
So where does that leave us?  I've got what I consider to be a stupid 
error message in my log.  My system behavior isn't affected in any way 
(at least that I can tell), yet I get a loud complaint at boot time.
I guess I just have to live with it?
Thanks,
Jesse
