Agreed. That's what I've been saying for years (since early 2.6 when we had
all those scheduler troubles and I started nicksched).

I think scheduler timeslices actually shouldn't really be getting shorter.
While I found it is quite easy to get good interactivity with a pretty
dumb scheduler and tiny timeslices (at least until load ramps up enough
that the "off-time" for your critical processes builds up too much), I
think we want to aim for large timeslices. CPU caches are still getting
bigger, and I don't think misses are getting cheaper (especially if you
consider multi core). Also, the energy cost of a memory access is much
higher even if hardware or software is able to hide the latency.
