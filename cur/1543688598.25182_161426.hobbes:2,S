Do you know what chipsets they were using?  I would love to know!  Any success

Yes, that's what I thought.  But I've replaced every piece of hardware in the
machine except the motherboard.  If the problem persists after the 3ware 7506-8
is finally installed at considerable expense, then I'll buy an Intel
motherboard.  Does the kernel work well with the chipset on the Intel
S875WP1-E?

I guess I would disable the Promise PDC20319 IDE and stick with the 3ware.
It's just that I am trying to set up servers that use cheap storage at the
college and teach students to build them.  It looks like we still have to pay
big bucks for SCSI and 3ware.  And that part of my teaching will be replaced
with something else.  Until I understand the problem and how to solve it.
