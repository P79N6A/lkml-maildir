Hmm. There are dozens of points in raw1394 which call 
__queue_complete_req() which up()s the semaphore. ("fi" is the 
private_data of a struct file. Multiple outstanding requests may be 
associated with a file.) Then there are two places which wait on the 
semaphore:
raw1394_read(), called when somebody reads /dev/raw1394:
	if (file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK) {
		if (down_trylock(&fi->complete_sem))
			return -EAGAIN;
	} else {
		if (down_interruptible(&fi->complete_sem))
			return -ERESTARTSYS;
	}
raw1394_release(), called when somebody closes (releases) /dev/raw1394:
	done = 0;
	while (!done) {
		/* free all complete requests */
		/* set "done" if there are no more pending requests */
		if (!done)
			down_interruptible(&fi->complete_sem);
	}
	/* cleanup, free fi */
It looks like fi->complete_sem is a actually a counting semaphore. It 
could perhaps be replaced by a wait queue plus an atomic counter. There 
is even already a wait queue in "fi" for use with poll_wait() via 
raw1394_poll().
