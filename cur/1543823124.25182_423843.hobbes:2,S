fine, but the patch is still wrong.  If it really doesn't matter
which one it's on, instead of moving the put, just get the cpu var with
per_cpu(fdtable_defer_list, raw_smp_processor_id()) and get rid of the put
altogether.
Ingo,
Didn't John have a patch that did something with get_percpu_var() that
made this simple?
