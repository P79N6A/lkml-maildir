i'd like to avoid this kind of special cases, they all have a cost.
We're talking about feeding a hostile process bogus data and the process
attempting counter measures -- (hopefully) a very rare scenario in RL.
So the cost does not seem to justified, simply turning off the
usermode-syscalls and unmapping the data globally should be ok.
(this is kind of what i'd like to do for ptrace anyway)
That way only a system that needs this feature has to pay the price.
[there might be a better solution, but i need to do some benchmarking
 first]

hmm, i can't see a way to do this 100% transparently, not w/o further
restrictions (turning off rdtsc, artifically reducing/altering timings etc).
I don't think it's a big problem though, as long it's possible to turn off
the information leakage.
