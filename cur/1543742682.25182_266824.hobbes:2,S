As already said:
At least according to German law, the licence is still valid if some of 
the licence clauses are void because they violate the law.
If I know that a clause in a treaty is void according to the law, I can 
sign the treaty knowing that the clause is void but the treaty is still 
valid. The reason behind this is that a company shouldn't have any 
advantages from clauses that aren't allowed according to the law.

To clarify things:
- I do not use BK and I do not plan to use it
- I do currently not plan any significant contribution to any
  SCM tool
- although I'd be more happy if Linus would use an open source SCM tool,
  I can live with the current status quo
It has nothing to do with the question whether I like or dislike BK and 
it's licencing - I simply completely dislike it if someone from the USA 
thinks laws everywhere in the world are similar to US law. It's more 
than a year ago that I first told you that there's no case law in 
continental Europe, and to be honest, I'm quite pissed off by your 
attitude of still asking for case law in e.g. Germany.
Please, do me a favor and inform yourself about the differences. [1]

[1] e.g the Wikipedia article "Civil law (legal system)" gives an
    overview over the differences of the different law systems [2]
[2] it was interesting, I didn't know before that different from the
    other 49 US states, Louisiana has a civil law system
