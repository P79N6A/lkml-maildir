Hello,
I apologize if this is not the right place to ask, but I wanted to check if 
there is a mistake from my side before I open a new report in bugzilla.
The problem I have is that with 2.6.23.[89], the screen turns black 
immediately after switching into framebuffer mode. This doesn't happen with 
2.6.22.12. All kernels have been compiled with GCC 4.1.3 on an Ubuntu box 
with a K6-3 cpu and the fb boot options for all kernels are: 
video=matroxfb:vesa:0x105.
The config files for the working and non-working kernels are attached in 
gzipped form. I don't see anything in the configs that would trigger the 
problem, but maybe somebody here on the list does.
Many thanks in advance...
	Dirk
