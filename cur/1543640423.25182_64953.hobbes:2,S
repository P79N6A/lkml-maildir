Kernel.Org admins,
I was using the nifty patch viewing feature on the homepage when I 
noticed that in the per-file patch list for a given patch, the links 
generated are not correct. An example is the current ac patch view at:
http://www.kernel.org/diff/diffview.cgi?file=/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan/linux-2.4/2.4.20/patch-2.4.20-pre2-ac4.gz
Clicking on the link for drivers/net/3c59x.c actually leads to the patch 
for drivers/net/cs89x0.h. Similar problems appear to exist for viewing 
of the other patches as well, with different offsets in the file list.
Thanks for the cool viewer,
Rahul
