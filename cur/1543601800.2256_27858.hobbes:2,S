Locking.  There is a _lot_ of duplication between fs/namei.c and fs/xfs/* -
you definitely don't need most of the stuff you do with locks there.
I understand that some of that stuff may be needed for CXFS, and I would
really like to see the description of locking requirements of that animal.
Parts that are needed only on IRIX since IRIX VFS is braindead should go.
Parts that can be moved to generic code should be moved (with sane set of
methods provided by filesystems a-la CXFS). The rest will become much simpler.
