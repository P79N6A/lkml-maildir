That's the major problem if we ever want to preserve some ordering in the
queuing of SCSI IOs. It is not clear to me why a thread may help here. A
thread may help if you actually want to thread the queuing and/or if you
want to wait on resource. Note that using a thread for the queuing might
be a solution for preserving queuing ordering, but it is not the sole
solution.
Defunct T10/CAM addresses ordering problems especially during error
recovery by a freeze/unfreeze mechanism of device queues handled by SIMs
(SIMs are low-level drivers under Linux). Using threads, call-backs or any
other evil things on top of this mechanism can be a matter of O/S
dependent issues, but it is not the solution of the problem.
