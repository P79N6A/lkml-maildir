I'm pondering setting up a mailinglist for native Linux 2.6 IPSEC users and
I'm wondering is such a list exists already and what your feelings are. 
This list would be a place for end-users to discuss, where problems found
could be thrown over the fence to netdev if needed. Interoperability with
FreeS/WAN would also be an appropriate subject.
This list could also have a webpage listing all available tools, a FAQ,
whatever.
Thanks.
