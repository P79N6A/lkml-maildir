Greetings, people,
I've found that unlinking a 200M file leads fairly reliably on my
system to >50ms drop-outs (as reported by Benno's latencytest
(www.gardena.net/benno/linux/audio) or my own rtcskips).  This holds
whether I use 2.2.10 or 2.3.11, with or without Andrea and Ingo's
patches, using scsi or ide drives.
I can see why the unlink operation would take that long, but I'm
having trouble seeing why POSIX real-time processes wouldn't be able
to run at any point during it.  Can anyone tell me where exactly
they're getting locked out?  Is my understanding that lock_kernel() is
a no-op on a uniprocessor incorrect?  I wish to move to a more
advanced state of ignorance on this topic. :)
Best regards and thanks in advance,
Eric
