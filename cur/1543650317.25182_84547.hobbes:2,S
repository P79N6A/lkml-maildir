FWIW I have a very similar machine (its not in front of me
unfortunately) that used to exhibit the same behavior under Win2k.  I
haven't been using it since I got into a position to put it back under
Linux (the battery is shot - I was just using it to run software
required by my old ISP) but I can give it a try if needed.
It was exactly as described, only under windows - the machine would
reboot, bios go past, the initial boot menu would go, then partway
though the color-bar boot screen it would just turn off.
