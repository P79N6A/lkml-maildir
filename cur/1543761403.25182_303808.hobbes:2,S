I do "grep check-route.sh oom_2.6.11.3.txt | wc" and it shows 4365
lines, which means
there're 4365 that script processes running, from pid 4260 to12747,
mostly with pretty low points, 123.  Based on this points, suppose
each script consumes 100k, that'll be 100k*4k=400M roughly. And your
box's is merely 256M MemTotal.
The currently oom algorithm fails to find out such kinds of memory hog.
And the kernel kills other innocent processes because the its points
is much lower than most others.
Check this script and disable it; see what will happen.
