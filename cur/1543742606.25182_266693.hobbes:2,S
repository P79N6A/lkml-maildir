This comes from the block layer, generic_make_request(),
request is screwed up before it hits IDE layer.

Indeed, this is a lot more fun. ;)
Is this bug new/old?
Is it pdc202xx_old specific?  Does the same havoc happen
if you connect drives to the on-board Intel IDE controller?
Please post /proc identify data for both drives and PCI config
space dump for PDC20267 so someone can verify them.
