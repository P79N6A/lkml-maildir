Ouch, yes thanks for catching that, that's horribly wrong. Its a
leftover from a previous example where I was actually was passing int*
not int. I'll fix up the example and resend it. That is what comes
from not being able to test it I guess.

I'd like to break it up, but I think even broken up by major part of
the kernel it one piece will still be too large since the majority of
the changes take place in drivers & drivers/i2c and are very
asymmetric :-(. I'll send you the patch inline privately for now.

Well another __ATTR macro (e.g. ATTR_PRIVATE) would make declaring the
new DEVICE_ATTR_PRIVATE macro, etc, easier. We can't really use __ATTR
nicely though when declaring static attributes and wanting to set the
private data, hence why I think there is the need for a macro (see
http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg31399.html
).
The question really is, is it better to just add that new parameter to
the DEVICE_ATTR macro, or to declare a new DEVICE_ATTR_PRIVATE macro
instead. The former obviously breaks a lot of code although my scripts
can generate another large patch for that too...
Thanks,
Yani
