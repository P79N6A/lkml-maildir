The ticketing scheme -based alternative only really has to involve a
pgd coming into active use, so s/mmlist addition points/pgd reuse points/
would be better here to retain instructions for anyone suffering from
contention on pgd_lock how to address the issue with the new mmlist
scheme. pgd_alloc() and pgd_free() actually appear to suffice, and it's
also worth mentioning the ticketing scheme's MMU context switch and
smp_call_function() requirements as well.
So I'll send an update to that comment a bit later on.
