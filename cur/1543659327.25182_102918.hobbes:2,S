I'm seeing enough other -ac specific errors to be fairly sure its not just
hardware in the current -ac tree case. I don't know what the common factor

Guess #1 is reverting mm/shmem.c. Guess #2 is reverting the buffer cache
changes. Guess #3 is new IDE + highmem and Guess #4 is quota related (are
people seeing the problem with quota disabled ?)
