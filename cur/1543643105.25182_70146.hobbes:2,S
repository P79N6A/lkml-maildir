Tonight I updated the scripts so all filesystem types

If you have patches against a current tree, I can apply
them before testing a kernel.  I'll start paying more
attention to reiserfs-list.  It's probably best to test
patches when the -rc series starts.

It's gpl.  i only running aim7 on ext2 atm.

Will there be a choice of mounting reiserfs
or reiser4?  (like ext2 or ext3), or will there
be a complete departure?
