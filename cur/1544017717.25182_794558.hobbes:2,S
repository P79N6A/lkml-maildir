I wish it would be so simple as I would have removed the said indirection
long time ago.  Unfortunately:
- not all archs support ioread() & co.
- there is still issue with cache aliasing on some CPUs
Once above deficiences get fixed we can look into ioread() conversion again.
[ IOW right now it is the correct thing to stick to ide_mm_*() indirection
  since extra hardware coverage is more valuable than minor code cleanup. ]
Thanks,
