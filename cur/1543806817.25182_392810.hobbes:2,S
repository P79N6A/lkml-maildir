I got the previous reply but accidentially deleted it. The
kernel may try to create some contiguous pages for DMA or
other usage. If some page in your task can be switched to
make that continuous allocation, it might be.
If your program(s) rely upon being in some physical location,
they are broken. Even with mlockall(), you just keep them
where they are, not where you'd like them to be. If you
are trying to DMA into/out-of user-space, there is only
ONE way to do it. Your driver allocates DMA-able pages and
your code mmaps() it into user-space. That way, the page(s)
are always present and have the right attributes. If you
malloc() something, then try to "convert" in the kernel
through your driver, the code's broken.
Cheers,
