Umm, yes. Unfortunately I've got the plans but not the time, so maybe it's
best not to rely on me to fix anything, though. As soon as find some free

I'll see if I can find time to snarf the *BSD stuff and take a look, but
no promises. Meanwhile, maybe it's time to start rattling the "remove
orphaned filesystems from 2.4" sword in its scabbard, in the direction
of Martin von L.
