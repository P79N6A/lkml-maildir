Ahh, ok. I'll try to dig a bit deeper, but finding such details on 
vendor websites is not always easy. Anyway, the board I'm looking at has 
a 64bit 66Mhz PCI-X bus & slot (it's a low-end server/workstation board, 
Intel E7210 Canterwood ES/MCH+6300ESB+FWH chipset), so the controller 
can easily be replaced with something else without losing out to much on 
the performance side of things. Like the Marvell, wich is on the PCI-X 
bus, onboard.

Sounds like a plan :-)
