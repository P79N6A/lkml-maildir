I just wanted to let y'all know that I've been trying to keep an
up-to-date status page for sparc32 at 
http://osinvestor.com/sparc/
 with
basic information on 2.4 and 2.5 compiling and booting (or not as may
be.)
And yes, 2.5.65 builds and boots UP on sparc32, for me at least.  SMP is
badly broken.
