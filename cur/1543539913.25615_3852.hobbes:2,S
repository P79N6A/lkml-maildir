   You might even get the serial thing to work if you can get it into
   polled mode (do we even support this any more? I know we used to support
   an interrupt-less serial card back in the -92 timeframe.  Badly, but
   still). 
Interrupt-less serial support still works.  The timeout code is
necessary as a watchdog timer in case we lose an interrupt edge given
the brain-damaged ISA bus if we have more than one UART on an IRQ.  So,
using it to support interrupt-less code was (and is) trivial.
