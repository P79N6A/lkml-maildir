It could be worse.  Java didn't have a "truncate file" command at all until I 
yelled at Sun about it.  (It was too late to get it into 1.1, but they added 
it to 1.2.  Of course, that was back when I cared about Java... :)
Al Viro mentioned that making hole creation play nice with mmap would be evil.  
I suspect that having the "punch hole" call simply fail if any part of the 
range you're trying to zap is currently mmaped is probably good enough for a 
first pass.  (Maybe some fallback code could write zeroes into the range so 
the behavior was sort of similar in the failure case...)  But I haven't 
looked at the code enough to even know what the issues are, and I certainly 
won't have time this week...
