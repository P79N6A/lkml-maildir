I don't like this. That's not the point for performances. If you need to
delete an huge tree but you don't care about the deletion speed you don't
want to fork (wasting CPU) because you want to preserve CPU (and some task
slot) for all other other CPU bound processes running in background.
If instead your app care about deletion, userspace threading can solve the
issue equally efficient using an ad-hoc thread. If this will be a common
issue we can develop a 1kbyte libunlink.
