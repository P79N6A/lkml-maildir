so you add kdb to the kernel you ship to customers, teach your reps
how to use it.. and hey presto.
linus et al are happy cause the standard kernel is pure.
you're happy cause your field reps in the event of a crash can tell
you "this exact bit here was fubar'ed." whereupon you may apply the
Ingo/Al/Linus/David patented MKDB method.
