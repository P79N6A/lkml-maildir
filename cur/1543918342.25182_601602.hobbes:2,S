Yes, something in user space has to do it.  It's part of the
kernel-user cpuset API.  If you change a cpuset's 'cpus', then
you have to rewrite each pid in its 'tasks' file back to that
'tasks' file in order to get that 'cpus' change to be applied
to the task struct cpus_allowed of each task, and thereby visible
to the scheduler.
