Hi Con,
thanks for your fast reply. Unfortunately - I cannot patch a vanilla 
2.4.20 kernel using patch -p1. The first hunk fails, the other ones are 
found with offsets or even fuzz. Although I applied the first hunk 
manually, compiling fails.
Do I need the other patches, too? Or a special version of the kernel?
Greetings from Munich,
Torben
