Yes, it was rewritten in 2.5 to not suck quite as bad, and now uses Qt.

Qt != KDE. You only need Qt installed for this. Qt is rather smaller than
the kernel source anyway :-)
I think there's a GTK-based configurator around somewhere too, and you could
probably rewrite a Tk one if so inclined... the configuration actually uses
a library now, so the frontends are decently independent.
