What is the motivation for adding aio_resfd to an individual iocb 
instead of the entire io context?  It seems redundant, as you can 
already create multiple io contexts to wait on.
[also, minor nit: sys_eventfd() can legitimately return 0, but you're 
banning its use in aio.  userspace could easily dup() and close(), but...]
