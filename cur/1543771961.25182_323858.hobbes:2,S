Hi Lukas,
It looks like you have a T110 card (10Gb TOE) by the device ID 0006.
The Chelsio driver which is in the 2.6 mm tree only supports the NIC model cards 
(N110 & N210).
We currently don't have the TOE API in the Linux kernel so the TOE functionality 
does not exist, therefore you can only use the Chelsio modified 2.6.6 kernel for 
TOE.
You will need to download the driver from Chelsio's website for the T110. Please 
send me an email if you don't have a login.
Thanks,
Scott Bardone
