This includes some wrong documentation updates:

This is _not_ a problem with tmpfs, but with khttpd.  The same problem
is also present with nay filesystem that uses the pagecache but not
generic_file_read or a non-trivial wrapper around generic_file_read, such
as smbfs, ncpff, nfs, (open-)gfs, or xfs.  This might not always mean
those filesystems don't work at all with khttpd, but at least it opens
race conditions.  khttpd uses do_generic_file_read directly instead of
using a file operation, and the problem is that do_generic_file_read
should never have been exported to allow such a layering violation.
sendfile() and the loop driver have the same issue. In 2.5 of those
only the loop issue is still existant, and I plan to fix that one and
make do_generic_file_read static.
+   There is debate about whether to remove kHTTPd from the main
+   kernel sources.  This will probably happen in the 2.5 kernel series,
+   after which khttpd will still be available as a patch.
khttpd is gone in 2.5
