On Ia64 Itanium 1 machines with more than 2.5GB of RAM the follwing error is triggered.
slab error in check_poison_obj(): cache `size-16384': object was modified after freeing
The machine that triggered the error above is an
i2000 HP workstation
4gb RAM
1gb SWAP
An identical machine with 2.5GB ram produces:
slab error in check_poison_obj(): cache `size-2048': object was modified after freeing
if the amount of RAM is reduced to 2GB or less then the errors do not appear.
