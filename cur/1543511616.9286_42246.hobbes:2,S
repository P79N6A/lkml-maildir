Time for me to update klogd I guess -- the manpage here doesn't say
anything about System.map-{version}.  In fact the page from the 1.3-31 kit
I just unpacked doesn't either.  ps' page does, but ps apparently doesn't
look for /System.map while klogd does.  (ps does look in
/lib/modules/{version} while klogd doesn't.)  Meanwhile 'make install' in
the kernel top directory puts the map in /System.map unless you uncomment
a line or otherwise define INSTALL_PATH.  It's a bit confusing.
Whoops, the klogd page is incomplete -- The Source says it does try
System.map-{version} first and then System.map.  I'll send the author a
patch for the manpage.
Whoops again, procps 2.0.5 does look at /System.map .  I'll send a patch
for the manpage.

Please, no more software products offering a "richer experience"!  I have
indigestion of the brain already.  Give me a more ascetic experience.
