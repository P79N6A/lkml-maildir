it's not inconsistent. /proc/interrupts lists registered interrupts plus 
some special hardcoded platform interrupts that are not explicitly 
registered - with the goal of providing a list of all active interrupt 
sources. /proc/interrupts has been doing that for more than 10 years. 
Clock event devices themselves are not 'interrupt lines', why should 
they be listed in /proc/interrupts?
