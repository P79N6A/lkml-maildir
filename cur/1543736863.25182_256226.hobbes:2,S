We have mentioned this but 90% of the work done by the drivers would
be common, we might do it the otherway I suppose have a driver probe
that calls a function in the core,

I think we have doxygen comments in there at the moment - the Mesa/DRI
documentation is done with doxygen...

there are a fair few of these in there in the kernel, it could
probably do with a Lindent at some stage over the whole thing...

I think I can apply a lot of these to the current kernel code so I'll
probably just start doing patches up for these sort of issues
separately....
I'll get time to create a bitkeeper tree taking Jons changes ready for
merging to Andrew at least, and maybe Linus for 2.6.10.
Dave.
