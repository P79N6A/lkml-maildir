I suppose it depends a bit on how your system is administered.  On LVM
systems, I tend to allocate new volumes for special situations like this.
When the special need is gone, you simply remove the whole thing.  Yes,
this is a bit of a hack for not having online shrinking, but I have not
really had a _big_ need to do that.
The only time I've really needed online shrinking is when someone
screwed up and made / or /var way too huge for some (bad) reason and
you can't unmount it conveniently.  Under AIX, you can't shrink JFS
even unmounted so it meant backup/restore.  Even so, having empty
space in a filesystem is not a reason to panic, while having no free
space in a filesystem _is_ a reason to panic, hence online growing
of ext2.
Cheers, Andreas
