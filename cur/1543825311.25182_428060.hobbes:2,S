You were supposed to know, if I hadn't made a typo :) "a bug".

Yes.

Which is what I want to know. I don't exactly have an interesting
disk setup.

Yes. So set_page_dirty_lock is broken, right?
And the wait_on_page_stuff needs an inode ref.
Also splice seems to have broken sync_page.

Well yes, writing to a page would be the main reason to set it dirty.
Is splice broken as well? I'm not sure that it always has a ref on the
inode when stealing a page.
It sounds like you think fixing the set_page_dirty_lock callers wouldn't
be too difficult? I wouldn't know (although the ptrace one should be
able to be turned into a set_page_dirty, because we're holding mmap_sem).
You're sure about all other lock_page()rs? I'm not, given that
set_page_dirty_lock got it so wrong. But you'd have a better idea than
me.
