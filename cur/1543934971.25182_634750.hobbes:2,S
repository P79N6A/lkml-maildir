Hello,
I have a kubuntu system with a firestarter Firewall.
I did purchase a Sweex router. This router has also a firewall.
If I connect the router then i have two Firewalls.
The result is that no visitor from outside can visit my wiki's, because 
they have to pass 2 Firewalls.
How can I disable the firestarter Firewall with iptables ?
The Sweex router has a Mikkisoft Firewall , so I do not know anything 
about it and I can not disable it.
regards  Wim
