I agree, I don't see any other solution. btw the thing is not
simple. The oom killer should be able to comply instructions
like:
if (oom)
  kill netscape if it uses more than 80MB {stdprio 10}
  //sometimes if start sucking memory endlessly
  kill make and its childs if overall they use {stdprio 7}
  more than ...[cpu files memory]
  //ever tried to make -j bzImage on a 64MB box ?
  kill httpd if it's swapping too much {stdprio 3}
  ...
Well, it's not simple. It must be planned carefully, or it
will and up being as uneffective as the current killer is.
Bye.
