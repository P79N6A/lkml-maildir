Hi.  I have been noticing an nntp problem in my 2.5.73 kernel.  I
have inn 2.3 set up on my machine and I use gnus to read mail and
news.  Now what happens is that when gnus starts up it connects to
the server (same box) and gets all the active newsgroups.  What I
have noticed is a drastic slowdown in 2.5.73 (or other 7x) than in my
2.4.20 kernel and I was wondering if anyone else has seen this or can
tell me either a workaround or what is going on with this.
Thanks.
