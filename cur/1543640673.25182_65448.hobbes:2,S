My current version adds a sysctl that lets you assign between 0.01 and 1
bits to untrusted sources, defaulting to 0. Headless folks without
hardware RNGs can use it to get ample amounts of entropy from network
packets (together with patches that turn on SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM for
NICs). I believe this should be acceptable to all parties - I'll
resend sometime soon.
