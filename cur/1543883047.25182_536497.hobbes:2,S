Ask the architecture people, but comments like
/data/l/linux/include/linux/agpgart.h:  long access_flags;      /* long req'd for set_bit --RR */
Make me think long is needed.
 * bitmaps provide bit arrays that consume one or more unsigned
 * longs.  The bitmap interface and available operations are listed
 * here, in bitmap.h
...I'm afraid we need ulongs.
