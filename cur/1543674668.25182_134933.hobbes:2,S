No, I think there is a flush missing somewhere in this path.
What I think is happening is that Lothar is using the PXA with the cache
in write allocate write back mode (Xscale is the first ARM-arch cpu to
have allocate on write caches.)
This means that when IDE copies the data into the buffer using insw or
whatever, it ends up in the VIVT cache rather than memory.  Since we
don't seem to be calling flush_dcache_page(), we never write this data
back to memory for user space to access it via their mapping.
If this is the case, its something I can't test, because I don't have
access to such hardware (I'm currently being kept a hardware pauper
as far as new ARM technologies go.)

I don't think this'll help - its asking the wrong bit of cache to be
flushed.  I think we want to replace that flush_icache_page() with
a flush_dcache_page(), but shrug, I don't really know this code well
enough.

I suspect that there's very few people who really understand this area -
you need to know what the block drivers are doing, and everything in
between there and user space.
