the easy way to force all executables to be in ram all times is:
1. configure the box with zero swap
2. on boot, untar all your executable and .so files to a tmpfs mount.
this is in effect loading them into ram since you have no swap.
3. set the PATH and .so related vars so that all exe and .so files are
gotten from the tmpfs file.
