Ah, but no!  You assume we do not have an expired list and round robin
scheduling.
Once a task exhausts its timeslice, it cannot run until all other tasks
exhaust their timeslice.  If this were not the case, high priority tasks
could monopolize the system.

I agree, although I do think it responds fairly quick.  But, regardless,
this is why I am interested in Nick's work.  The interactivity estimator
can never be perfect.

Hm, why?

But latency is important.
