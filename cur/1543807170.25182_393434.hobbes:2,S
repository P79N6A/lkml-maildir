swsusp may be an ongoing source of churn and bug reports, but it's
also been more reliable for me (on multiple types of hardware) than
Windows XP hibernate. In fact, at this point I'm perfectly satisfied
with its reliability (i.e. I haven't had any problems lately).
(I just figure that I need to speak up, as a highly satisfied swsusp user.)
