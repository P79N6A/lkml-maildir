Hi folks,
Is there a generic driver that redirects a device over a network?  For
instance, I run X applications remotely, but I want things like sound to be
played on my own computer.
This would take a client/server approach, with the client being the device
driver.  It should probably be quite configurable on both ends, and have
features like only certain processes owned by certain a UID would be
redirected, etc.
I ask only because I have not found one, and I wouldn't want to write
something that has already been written.  If it turns out that I'm right, and
there is no driver like this, I'll write my own. (note:  this is a threat.
:-)
This could be used with a host of applications;  Printer spooling, modem
sharing, network audio, etc.  I know a lot of these devices already have
network capabilities, but I think it would be far more elegant to route them
all through one specialized service.
Does anybody have any thoughts, or am I over-looking the obvious?
