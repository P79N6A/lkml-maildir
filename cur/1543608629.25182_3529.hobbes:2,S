If you spec your boxes such that you have extra CPU cycles around after
TUX is done, consider software raid. Software raid is faster than hardware
raid in almost every circumstance I have seen, with the caveat that it
uses slightly more CPU resources (RAID 5 has worst CPU performance because
of parity calculations, RAID 1 is better)
