Right.  Just to clarify, performance is currently horrible on PC hardware
because we read (memmove) from the framebuffer a lot when dragging windows
around.  And it seems PC hardware does this really slowly.
DinX is designed with small systems in mind, many of which have the video
buffer in main DRAM, and no 2D accel.  (I'm thinking of my favourite ARM
parts, like the ARM7500, CL-PS7110, EP7211 etc.)  On these, reading the
buffer is as fast as any other memory, so DinX should work fine the way it
is now.

Right.  The idea is just to take clipping and blitting out of the server
process and put them in the kernel, to avoid lots of context switches and
big complex buffering code.
Something else I should mention:  The clipping code performs no memory
allocations, so drawing keeps off the heap.  When an obscuring window
splits a rectangular blit into two rectangles, the routine recurses for
each, so the complexity of the visible area goes on the stack.  Now, how
much stack space does the kernel have?  :)
Cheers,
