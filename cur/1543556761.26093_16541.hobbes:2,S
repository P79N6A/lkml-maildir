During boot, the Linux kernel code (on Alpha) changes the PCI resource
settings of cards and bridges alike. Some SRM consoles do not appreciate
this... ;-}
There is code in 2.2 that restores card/bridge settings before exiting
the kernel back to console mode. This code has NOT been ported to 2.4,
due primarily to the size of the changes made to 2.4 in that area.
Could you verify that 2.2 (take the latest, please) DOES exit to SRM
correctly?
A workaround for 2.4 is to set "boot_reset" to ON in SRM, which will
force a full reset before continuing the boot. Yes, I know, for a lot
of situations this is overkill, but at least it will do the right thing
under the above described situations...
Good luck.
