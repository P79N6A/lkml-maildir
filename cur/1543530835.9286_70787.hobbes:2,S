Subject: [PATCH] race with initrd and bdflush

For some configuration where there is only an initrd and no driver that
schedule() during their initialization, the kernel gets to play with
bdflush_tsk while the initrd is loading.  Because bdflush_tsk is
initialized within a kernel thread which may not have run yet, we then
just blow up!
Here is a quick fix:
