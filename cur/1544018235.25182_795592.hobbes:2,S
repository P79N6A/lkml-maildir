Chandru, I don't mean to keep ragging on your patches, but I really
don't think this is right, yet.
Let's take, for instance, a 1-byte reservation.  With this code, you've
suddenly turned that into a 0-byte reservation, and that *can't* be
right.  The same thing happens if you have a reservation that spans two
pages.  If you unconditionally round it down, then you might miss the
part that spans a portion of the second page.
It needs to be rounded down like you are suggesting here, but only in
the case where we've gone over the *CURRENT* node's boundary.  This is
kinda what that "if (end_pfn > node_ar.end_pfn)" check is doing.  But,
it evidently screws it up if the overlap isn't by an entire page or
something.
Please also, for pete's sake, use masks (a la PAGE_MASK) or macros if
you're going to page-align something.  Don't shift down and up like
that.
