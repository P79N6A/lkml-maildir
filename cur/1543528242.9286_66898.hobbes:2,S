Still confused on this.  As long as the cdrom in the versa sx is not
installed (I don't have any ide devices other than a cdrom to install in the
slot to see if it's just a cdrom or just the 2nd ide channel) the system
works w/o problems, no keyboard/mouse lockups.  If the cdrom is installed,
it does lockup.  (maybe init yenta before ide?)
I have completely disabled yenta_init which simply prints "yenta_init()
bypassed".  I goofed when I put the priority before it which was a good
goof.
After the system comes up, I login.  I can leave it idle or do things and I
get this from syslog: (This is every time)

krillin kernel:  yenta_init() bypassed
This is where I goofed in the priority, but then again, why is yenta_init
called when the system is idle?
Any idea's why mouse activity will lock the mouse/keyboard if both
1) yenta is compiled in
2) the cdrom (ide1/hdc) is installed
I don't believe re-enabling yenta_init() will change a thing, but I'll try
it.
