Please also recall that NFSv2 assumes that all writes are performed
synchronously on the server (all data and metadata is immediately
flushed to disk). In principle, once the NFS_OK is received by the
client, I'm allowed to attack my server with a pickaxe without
risking any data loss (unless the disk spills its guts).
As long as we violate the synchronicity assumption strict adherence to
the rule of atomicity of writes becomes a largely academic issue.
For NFSv3, things are of course different, since there the NFS_COMMIT
instruction exists in order to trigger the flushing to disk.
