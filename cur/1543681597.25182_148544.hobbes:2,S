Please look the older postings.
There is a new handling of Touchpad, as of 2.5.74.
Until the userspace programs (X w/o special driver,
gpm) are adapted, there is a workaround:
preferably compile mouse support as a module (called
'psmouse').
Load the module with a parameter 'modprobe psmouse
psmouse_noext=1' .
You could alternatively pass that parameter to your
kernel boot parameters (if psmouse is not a module).
These are under the 'options' part of LILO, for
example.
This workaround will enable the old PS/2 mode of the
touchpad and X will be able to read events from
'/dev/input/mice'.
ps. please remind the lkml about this. I'm not sending
from my regular address.
