That message confirms my suspicion. The bits were apparently needed
in the ancient discrete LAPICs, but they clearly must not be set
in some current integrated LAPICs.
To handle both cases the code should do one of those "is intergrated"
tests we alreay have several of in apic.c. I can fix that, but not
until tomorrow.
