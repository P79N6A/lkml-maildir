I will look more closely at what might have changed there.  Despite
the code refactoring (and a hand-resolved patch collision at that
point) the async disable handling *should* have been functionally
unchanged from 2.6.18.  I will revisit that closely.
Has it actually been demonstrated that this does not crash 2.6.18
(pre-my-patches) kernels?  If it crashes earlier, that doesn't mean
I'm uninterested in fixing it, I just want to know.  I don't think
that had been explicitly answered earlier in the thread.
