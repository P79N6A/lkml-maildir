I have a similar problem with a ALi M5229 but only with dma enabled. if it
suspends with dma enabled, when it resumes I got dma timeouts until it give
up and disable dma. after this I can't enable dma anymore. I guess
implementing resume() of alim15x3 to reconfigure chipset will solve this.
any sugestions/comments?
