I am not sure on how to account for this _big_ perf. gain but from
benchmarks I see that whenever I remove unncessary casting from tight
loops I get perf. gain of 1-2%. For e.g. open coding
LZO_CHECK_MPOS_NON_DET macro with all unnecessary casting removed,
gave perf. gain of ~2%. Similarly, I found many other places where
such casting was unnecessary.
These changes have been tested on x86, amd64, ppc. Testing of 'take 6'
version is yet to be done - this will confirm that I didn't
reintroduce some error.
