But i cannot reproduce the problem that way, in my case dmesg flooded as soon 
as somebody trying to _access_ to VCD. I disabled hal and closed KDE to test 
and that problem no longer reproducible for me. So its really seems a 
userspace problem and i think all of them (KDE's cdpolling backend, hal, 
mplayer and xine-lib) has problems with kernels >= 2.6.17
