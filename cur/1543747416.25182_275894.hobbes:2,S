If anyone uses extern inline in the way that it is intended, i.e.
provide an inline function in a header and an out-of-line version
of the same function in some C file, that breaks.
It would be pointless to use extern inline this way now, since we define 
inline to mean always_inline in the kernel, but gcc will give you a 
compile error when it sees the same function defined both as 'static
inline' and as 'extern'. The correct fix is to convert 'extern inline'
to 'static inline' and at the same time remove any external definitions
of the same function.
Another point that has been mentioned before is that forcing inline
to always_inline is not really a good idea. My personal preference
would be to convert all uses of 'extern inline' that are meant as
'this breaks if it is not inline' to something like 'static 
__always_inline' instead of plain 'static inline'. Then maybe some
day the annotations get good enough to leave the decision
to the compiler for the regular case.
