By this definition, however, the scheduler and virtual memory manager are bugs.  So it's not really a useful definition.  It would also make feature freezes pointless, since features can be disabled and won't affect everyone, whilst bug fixes should be heavily controled since they affect everyone.
As an exercise to help make Linux development less crazy, coming up with REAL definitions (not trite sayings) and removing the seeming arbitrariness in designation would be nice.  Not neccicarily making rigid, unchanging policies, but a guideline that people can write to, and know what to expect from a feature freeze.  In 'normal' software development, a feature freeze usually means that APIs don't change, and entirely new filesystems don't appear...
