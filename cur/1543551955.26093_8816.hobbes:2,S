We don't need to decide on one, you can provide and install your
own, if your apply my oom-killer-api-patch.
It's at: 
http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~ioe/oom_kill_api.patch
PS: Removed Linus from CC, because every change of MM has to be
   approved by Rik first. Added linux-mm, because it's an MM issue.
PPS: We had an controversal discussion at linux-mm about this
   last week. So look into the archives.
