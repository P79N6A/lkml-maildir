What the ^*!#^% is this:
driver/video/pvr2fb.c:
int __init pvr2fb_init(void)
{
        struct fb_var_screeninfo var;
        u_long modememused;
        if (!MACH_DREAMCAST)
                return -ENXIO;
...
That's the first time I've seen such, well, badness.
It looks like someone forgot what platform is *required* for the PowerVR 2...
drivers/video/Config.in:
   tristate '  NEC PowerVR 2 display support' CONFIG_FB_PVR2
   dep_bool '    Debug pvr2fb' CONFIG_FB_PVR2_DEBUG $CONFIG_FB_PVR2

PS: Compiling 2.4.9 on an Alpha is turning up all manner of weird stuff.  Like
    a lot of drivers that aren't 64bit clean, missing parts of asm-alpha...
