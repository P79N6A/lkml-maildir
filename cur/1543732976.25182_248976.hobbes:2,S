metas is much less likely than what clearcase uses to be hit 
accidentally (After all these years I forget what exactly clearcase 
special cases, maybe it was "@@").  When people using clearcase suffer a 
namespace collision, life goes on, no big deal, they structure a 
filename slightly differently and so what?  I mean, just how much do we 
suffer from not being able to use '/' in filenames?  Every once in a 
while it is annoying, but not that much....
