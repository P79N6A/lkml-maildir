That's confusing to me.  It was my understanding that the BKL is used to 
completely lock down the kernel so that no other CPU can have a process 
get into the kernel... something like how SMP was done under 2.0.
So, if you sleep during a BKL, wouldn't that imply that nothing else 
would be allowed to enter the kernel until after the kernel thread that 
took the lock wakes up and releases the lock?
