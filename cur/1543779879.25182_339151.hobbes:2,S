Uh... PLEASE tell me you are NOT changing timespec_to_jiffies() (and 
timeval_to_jiffies() to add 1.  This is NOT the right thing to do.  For 
repeating times (see setitimer code) we need the actual time as we KNOW 
where the jiffies edge is in the repeating case.  The +1 is needed ONLY 
for the initial time, not the repeating time.
