Can we try not to ratify a rule like that? :)
We're somewhat closeish to being able to entirely remove the ptl, so
it might just get awkward if people think they can rely on that rule.
Of course, _if_ holding the ptl is the nicest way to do things in the
mainline kernel then yeah OK I can't argue with that... but if at all
possible... pretty please?
Thanks,
Nick
