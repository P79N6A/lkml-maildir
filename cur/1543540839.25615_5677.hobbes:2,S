when I leave the computer without any activity (ie. when I do not use the
keyboard nor mouse) for a while, the console blanks. And when I move the
mouse or press some key on the keyboard, the console is redrawn again,
does anyone know how this is done ? is there some call from/to the linux
kernel that does this ? and if yes, what is that call ? thanks in
advance...
