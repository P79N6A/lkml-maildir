Gulp. I know that many of you are granularity advocates, but I
have to say that security derived by tweeking 1000 knobs so that
they are all just right seems a little far fetched to me. I see
it as poopooing the 3rd and most important part of the reference
monitor concept, "small enough to analyze". Sure, you can analyse
the 1000 individual checks, but you'll never be able to describe
the system behavior as a whole.
