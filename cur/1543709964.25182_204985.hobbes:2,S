Have you considered the problem of 64 bit uids? and gids?, and unlimited 
number of groups assigned to a single user? How about having to support
multiple maps (one for each remote host that mounts a filesystem)?
I suspect not - you don't have enough memory to handle it.
These tables are going to have to be external to the kernel, and the kernel
only caching those that are known to be active to speed up the search.
This will call for an external daemon to support the dynamic mapping. Second,
you will have to have one map for each exported filesystem for each host that
is allowed to mount it. I grant that frequently there will be one map used
multiple times, but the worst case is one for each host.
To speed the external lookups up I suggest using a radix search (not my
original idea - Cray did it first).
I also suggest making it optional - or being able to specify a 1:1 mapping
be assumed. And be used with an inverse table: UIDs that are NOT to be mapped
(as in, all uids are mapped 1:1 EXCEPT ...)
I have worked at centers that had about 1200 users on each of 5 compute 
servers. Each compute server mounts the same filesystem from a server. IF
and only if all systems are within one security domain (all users are common, 
and have the same uid/gid list for all systems - a frequent case), do
you not need a map.
If each compute server is in a different security domain (unique user list)
then you must have 5 maps (10 if you include group maps) for each filesystem.
That adds up to 6000 entries in uid maps alone. If 64 bit uids are used (8
bytes/uid) that becomes 48K for the example, with only ONE exported
filesystem, and only uids. This might seem a lot, but consider exports to
workstations - 150 workstations, and likely 2-5 uids each (at least
one for admininistration use). That would be 150 maps (just uids), of only 5
entries each - 750 entries, 6K (more reasonable).
With Linux showing up more and more in large clusters, I expect the total
number of users to increase for the worst case result (consider 4 128 node
clusters mounting filesystems from an archive cluster: 512 mounts, with maybe
100 users for each cluster? something like 4MB for maps alone)
