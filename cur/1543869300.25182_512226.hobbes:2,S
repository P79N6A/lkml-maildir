Please open a bug report here:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ACPI
and please attach (don't paste) the complete output from dmesg -s64000
plus the output from acpidump > acpidump.out.
If you don't have acpidump, you can get it from the latest pmtools here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
please also attach the config file you're using.
thanks,
-Len
