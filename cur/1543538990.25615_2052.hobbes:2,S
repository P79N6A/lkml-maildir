Hi,
during boot of 2.4.0-test4-pre I saw that AGP was unsupported. Is there
a patch available to get this working on the via chipset  (before my
machine shot itself in the foot, now I love backup. Nexttime I will make
one :-(()?
And by the way how is the backport of AGP support for using in DRI
coming along for the 2.2.x kernels ?
Thanks for any kind of reply in advance.
Best regards
Michael Meding
