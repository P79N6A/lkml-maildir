Note that most of this thread occurred off-list and this is the tail end.
It looks as though the timer tick interrupt is going away.  If true, 
that's well outside the scope of what can be detected/repaired from inside 
do_gettimeofday().  So the workarounds posted on this list that I've seen 
look like the wrong approach.  That includes the fix that's in 2.4.18.

On this note, if anybody has any hints on why the timer may be dying, how 
to debug it, or better places to detect/fix it, I'd be grateful.
