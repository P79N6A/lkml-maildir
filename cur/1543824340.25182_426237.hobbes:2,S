Sorry,  i have allready did these things.
The motherboard + CPU + RAM successed the overnight memtest, but anyway i
have replaced this group with another pre-tested ones, but no change!
(Additionally, i replaced the NIC [e1000 to e1000, and e1000 to realtek],
the sata cards [promise to promise], the sata and ide cables, mb, cpu, ram,
ps, and the power cable too.
Only the 12hdd is the same, but smart reports no errors at all!)
The power supply is the 3rd. and the problem is the same.
This is really a software bug, but i dont know exactly where.
Cheers,
Janos
