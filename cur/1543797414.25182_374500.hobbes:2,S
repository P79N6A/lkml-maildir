No, all bus components and other chips between CPU and the implementing
chip (including the latter) must have 64-bit data paths and guarantee
not to break up 64-bit reads into pairs of 32-bit ones. Actually, it's
the other way around - since most modern 32-but x86 CPUs have (as far as
I know) 64-bit data busses, it is normally not the CPU that restricts
accesses to 32 bits.
