We modified mcount now, and it is derived from an objdump of glibc. So
this is most definitely a "derived" work from glibc. But glibc is licensed
as LGPL, which IIRC allows for non GPL to link to it.
I personally could care less if we use EXPORT_SYMBOL or EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.
But I really want to do The Right Thing(tm). I'm not a lawyer and don't
claim that I know anything about the law, but I'm leaning towards the non
_GPL version because the code was from LGPL and not from strict GPL.
