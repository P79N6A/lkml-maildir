nope. i have checked it, the length of the older skb is perfectly ok.....and
i even found that this weird behaviour happens only when the old skb buffer
length is between 80 and 224 bytes. 
and apart from this problem, i even found out that when i send a packet >=
186 bytes the kernel allocates a lot of memory in the skb...the output from
a simple test module is below:
PRE_R: skb: c7aa0da0 skblen: 185 headroom: 32 tailroom: 7    total_len: 224
PRE_R: skb: c7a43020 skblen: 186 headroom: 32 tailroom: 1334 total_len: 1552
This was generated by sending ipv4 ping packets of different sizes...I
tested it using 2.4.1 and 2.4.3 on two machines (both dual stack).
What the hell's going on :( ???
