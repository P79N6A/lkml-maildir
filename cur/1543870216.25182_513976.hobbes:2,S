Do you have a new version to review?

Ok, we're past the error code in the atom, as Linus pointed out ;)
How about this, with async_wait returning asynid's back to a userspace 
ring buffer?
struct syslet_utaom {
        long *result;
        unsigned long asynid;
        unsigned long nr_sysc;
        unsigned long params[8];
};
My problem with the syslets in their current form is, do we have a real 
use for them that justify the extra complexity inside the kernel? Or with 
a simple/parellel async submission, coupled with threadlets, we can cover 
a pretty broad range of real life use cases?
