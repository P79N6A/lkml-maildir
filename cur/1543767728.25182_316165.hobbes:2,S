Besides, often the RUNNING state is more suspicious.

how can you detect this from outside of the process(es)?!

Anything, except for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP can be overridden.
And it doesn't help you anyway in detecting of runaway processes.

Except for the case described by Valdis Klietnieks, it's hard to define.
How do you distinguish between a very busy process and the deadly
locked in itself one?
You'll probably end up defining some arbitrary timeouts for the
processes under your control, some watchdog interface for the
processes and plain old kill(..., SIGCONT); kill(..., SIGKILL); restart();
