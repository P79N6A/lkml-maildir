I don't know about openbsd, but this sounds rather unlikely.
More likely is that you (or some installation script run by you)
marked that partition as swapspace.
mkswap for SWAPSPACE2 will preserve the first 1024 bytes, so it is possible
that you did this mkswap without destroying the disklabel.
Note that partition numbering is a black art, especially when you mix
several types of partition table. The name (number) of your partition
may depend on kernel version and on for what partition table types you
have support in your kernel.
