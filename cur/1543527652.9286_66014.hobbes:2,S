Have you tried it without -fno-builtin?  If you do, gcc grumbles about
various procedures not having the prototypes it expects, in particular
memset, memcpy, and memcmp.  It's not obvious from the warning messages
you get exactly what prototype gcc is expecting.
In general there's no particular reason why a function named `memcpy' in
the kernel should have the same prototype (or even the same behaviour) as
a function named `memcpy' in a userland program, which is why we use
-fno-builtin.
