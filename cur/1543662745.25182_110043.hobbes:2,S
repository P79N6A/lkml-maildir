Thanks, i'll try
btw, this is procps version 3.1.5 (debian sid environment)
I still think something is happening...usually sylpheed
opens that carpet in a few seconds (say < 5 seconds),
but when this happens (it doesn't happen always), it takes
like 10, 15, 20 seconds, those shown in the log.....
perhaps it's a sylpheed bug.
Thanks anyway, i'll look at the latest procps release.
