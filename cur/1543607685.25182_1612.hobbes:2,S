Subject: 2.4.13 issue: /dev/null flags reset to 600

After upgrading to 2.4.13 I recognised some programs are complaining
about /dev/null. 
And yes, /dev/null flags were changed to crw------- , again and again.
It turned out that happens every morning when my cron.daily scripts run.
And more specifically it happens every time when:
1. sensord (version 0.5.0) is restarted (in about one-two seconds after
sensord starts again)
2. syslog-ng (1.5.9) initalizes after boot, is restarted, or get a kill
-1 (the flags change at the next minute when syslog-ng awakes).
I went back to 2.4.9 and was not able to reproduce the same there. Tried
out in 2.4.13 also with and without devfs, it does not matter; however
in the boot sequence with devfs there is (a perhaps unrelated) error in
reparent_to_init

specifically.
