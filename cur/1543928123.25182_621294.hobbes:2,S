I'm presuming you're not talking about some sort of 
syslets/fibrils/threadlets here (executing an interpreted thread of 
execution in kernel space).  That's a whole separate ball of wax.

This would be the right thing to do if we were to redesign the system 
call interface from the ground up, which it doesn't exactly sound like 
we are intending.

The 6-word limit is a red herring.  There is at least two ways to deal 
with it (and this doesn't mean wiping the legacy stuff we already have):
- Let each architecture pick a calling convention and redefine the 
architecture-independent bits to take an arbitrary number of arguments. 
  This is a one-time panarchitectural change.
- Define the architecture-independent interface inside the kernel to be 
a 6-word interface and use a marshalling thunk when the number of 
parameters exceed this number.  **This is what we're currently doing.** 
     This is inefficient for s390 (which already has to thunk 
6-parameter functions in its arch layer), but I think all other 
architectures are fine.  Those thunks (stubs) could be generated 
automatically if we wanted to.
So I would advocate admitting that we already broke the 6-word limit and 
abolish it.  Then we can create new system calls that match what the 
user would see.

I find it very hard to see how it could be better performing than 
jumping through a thunk; in fact, for the second option (the one we're 
currently using) when gcc does top-level reordering the thunk (e.g. 
sys_pselect6) SHOULD simply the system call function proper (e.g. 
sys_pselect7).  For one thing, you will have at least one additional 
data-dependent indirect call in the path.
