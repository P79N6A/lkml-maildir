Yes, the delay occurs even when the device works fine, and it results
in no suspicious dmesg's (just a couple of 'unregistering' messages).
I have no case when this delay doesn't occur; it's only in this
testing that I've had occasion to rmmod the driver at all. In and of
itself, it's not a big problem.
