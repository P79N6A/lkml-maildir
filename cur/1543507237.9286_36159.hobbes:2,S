Change your script to:
exec /usr/sbin/pppd /dev/modem 115200 \
        $LOCAL_IP:$REMOTE_IP \
        connect $DIALER_SCRIPT
The use of setserial is only necessary for applications that do not
support speeds above 38400 declared directly as parameters. As this is
not the case of your pppd version, you can safely call it with the
'115200' parameter directly.
