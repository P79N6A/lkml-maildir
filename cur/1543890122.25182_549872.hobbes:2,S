Dear Professor/Lecturer
Please excuse us for contacting you directly. We are offering an efficient service to help you ensure your academic and professional work is written in perfect English. We will check the grammar and style of your work and return it to you to meet your requirements and deadlines.
Proof-Reading-Service.com can provide you with a professional proofreading service at a very reasonable rate. All our proofreaders are highly qualified native English speakers. Many work as leading academics in their fields and all have extensive experience of proofreading to the highest standards.
If you are interested in our service, please take a look at our website: www.proof-reading-service.com All you have to do is send us your document as a word attachment with the deadline and we will guarantee delivery of a perfectly written document to give you complete confidence when you submit your work. The fee is worked out on a flat rate (£6.95 per thousand words or 0.695 pence per word), so you know exactly how much the proofreading will cost in advance.
Once we have received your document(s) we will confirm the word count, the price and the deadline. If you have not heard from us within 2 hours during normal business hours after you have sent your work please resend it from a different email account or send the file to proofreadings@gmail.com.
We look forward to hearing from you!
Yours faithfully
