Hello all!
I'm having some networking problems with my Realtek
RTL8139 network card (I'm using Suse 7.2 which
installs Kernel 2.4.4, I guess).
The host hangs and the card's led starts flashing when
I do the following:
- access the X server remotely
- in a FTP session during file transfer
- in a TELNET session, sometimes.
After that all network access is dead.
The 8139too module is the one installed for the card.
How do I solve this problem?
JB
