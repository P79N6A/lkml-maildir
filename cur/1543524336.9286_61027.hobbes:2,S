Oh it does. Then you be able to read random kernel addresses from
every file system using generic_file_read, stealing other users data.
Now when you want to read a file from kernel space you usually have
a bug in the design. In Unix this should be near always be done by user space 
not in the kernel (e.g. to load firmware you would write a small utility
that loads them into your driver using a special ioctl etc.). Usually
you do not want to deal with path names in kernel drivers, that's 
bad style.
That being said, you can prevent the access_ok() check by using
        mm_segment_t oldfs = get_fs(); 
        set_fs(KERNEL_DS); 
        /* call */ 
        set_fs(oldfs);
