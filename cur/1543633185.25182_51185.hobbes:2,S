None, of course - the shell can't do the other futex ops, either. Futex  
file handles mean you can implement select() on them, but that's about all  
they have in common with files - there is certainly no read() or write()  
operation here!

Now *there* I disagree, at least for sockets. First of all, there's  
absolutely no need to be able to enumerate unopened sockets to justify  
putting them into the namespace - you can create them (in a special fs, of  
course) at the moment they are opened. (As in fact is done, in /proc/<pid>/ 
fd/.) And second, you *can* read() and write() there.
However, I don't think that's all that important. What I'd rather see is  
making the network devices into namespace nodes. The situation of eth0 and  
friends, from a Unix perspective, is utterly unnatural.
