	Which one ? ;-)
	Orinoco can work sometime with those cards, David may have
some updates in the pipeline (especially for WEP). The Prism2 driver
from Jouni is actually pretty nice and dedicated for those cards.

	Before doing that, have a chat with Alan that had a close look
with it for a partial opinion. And you may want to go through the
source yourself.
	My personal take is that linux-wlan-ng is nice, does a lot,
but is huge and complex, and it seems that Mark is not that interested
in merging it in the kernel. Keeping it as a separate module may make
most sense.
	BTW, there was a thread about this on the linux-wlan mailing
lists.
> How well does the prism2 driver work with the current wireless driver API?
	Very basic support (mostly read only). linux-wlan-ng has it's
own set of tools and MIB.
> Is there any particular reason why it is not in the kernel now?
	Nobody ever pushed it in. I can't force people to add their
driver int he kernel (hint : compare the list on my web page with the
list in the kernel).
