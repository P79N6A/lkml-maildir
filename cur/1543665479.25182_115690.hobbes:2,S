   it has been suggested that atm_vcc has redundant members with
   struct sock.
   this patch removes family, tx_inuse, rx_inuse, and recvq from 
   atm_vcc in favor of sk->family, sk->wmem_alloc, sk->rmem_alloc,
   and sk->receive_queue (respectively).
Applied, but Chas please build fresh patches in the future.
This stuff was all against a tree which still had the atm_dev
semaphore instead of the new spinlock.  Therefore half of the patches
rejected and I had to put these parts in by hand.
I did it this time, but really this needs to be done by you.
