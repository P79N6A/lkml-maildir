Thanx for the reply, what I'm doing is writing a driver (based on
mem.c) to export a block of ram to (other masters on) the PCI bus. The
driver does:
        1. get a contiguous block of ram using alloc_pages()
        2. export (via host-bridge hw setting) the block to the pci
           bus
        3. provide the .mmap() method in the driver to let userspace
           to mmap the device
In doing so, I encountered the inconsistencies of mmap(2) vs
read(2)/write(2). The work around I found is to SetPageReserved() on
all the pages got from alloc_pages(). But unfortunately I have no
clues why it's so. The vm code is not the easiest one to read
(compared to let's say the network code.)
