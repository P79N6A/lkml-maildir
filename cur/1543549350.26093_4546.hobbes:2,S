The code is:
uint64_t
user_of___ucmpdi2(uint64_t node, uint64_t port)
{
        switch (node)
        {
        case 1:
            if (node == port)
                return 0;
            break;
        case 2: /* variation in either 59-48 or 23-0 to reflect port number */
            /*
             * 63-60, 47-0 same in node and port;
             * 59-48 is 0 in node, port # in port
             */
            if (node == (port & ~((uint64_t) 0xFFF << 48)))
                return ((port >> 56) & 0xF) | ((port >> 44) & 0xFF0);
            /*
             * 63-24 same in node and port;
             * 23-0 of port minus 23-0 of node is effective port number
             */
            if ((node & (0xFFFFFFFFFF << 24)) == (port & (0xFFFFFFFFFF << 24)))
                return (port - node) & 0x1FFFFFF;
            break;
        }
        return port;
}
In reality, the switch does a 60 bit shift right, so I can cast to a
uint, which is the right thing to do on old architectures :-), solving
the problem.  I had originally thought that the problem was in all the
masks, shifts, and compares, but they are all inlined.
