When I wrote my user-space UDP over TCP tunneling software, I combined
the Internal IP and port and the External IP and port into a single 
hashed
value that I used as an index into my "psuedo-connection" hash, of which
each entry referenced an index in my 2000 item "pseudo-connection" 
table.
For each packet from an unrecognized host, I added a new hash entry and
table entry, then forwarded the packet.  When I get a new packet 
matching
an old-but-not-expired rule, I set the "last_seen" value to the current 
time.
When a connection is 5 minutes since "last_seen", then it can be removed
if there is pressure on the table, otherwise it will accept packets 
until it is
1 hour old, at which point it gets purged.  I've found that this system 
works
well at tunneling everything from Kerberos and OpenAFS to DNS without
problems.  Given that this relatively simple piece of sofware is able to
successfully manage a multitude of UDP connections, I would suggest
that an advanced connection-tracking firewall like yours has serious 
bugs
if it can't perform equally well.  Either that or it shouldn't be 
meddling in the
affairs of such UDP packets.
Cheers,
