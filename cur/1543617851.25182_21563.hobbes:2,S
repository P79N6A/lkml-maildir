   However, if it becomes easy to implement without impacting the code too
   much, then it will get fixed in due coarse.  The problem currently is
   that there is no way for the page table allocation functions to know
   that they should be using atomic and emergency pool memory allocations.
Encapsultate the page table allocation core interfaces into
__whatever_alloc() routines that take a GFP arg perhaps?
It is like a 15 minute hack.
BTW, the USB host controller drivers do this (allocate potentially
from interrupts) so anyone using USB on ARM...
