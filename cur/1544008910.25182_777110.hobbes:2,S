I got a build error with this version, and had to remove the #include
<byteorder.h> line.
After that, I get the following build warnings:
  CC [M]  drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.o
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c: In function ‘dma_test’:
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c:541: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c:548: warning: assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c: In function ‘probe’:
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c:803: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c:931: warning: label ‘err_rev’ defined but not used
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c:914: warning: label ‘err_cdev’ defined but not used
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c: At top level:
drivers/staging/altpciechdma/altpciechdma.c:416: warning: ‘ape_sg_to_chdma_table’ defined but not used
Also, sparse spits out a lot of warnings as well.
Care to send me a follow-on patch to fix these up?
thanks,
greg k-h
