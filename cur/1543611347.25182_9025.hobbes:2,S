It would be nice if it would be that way - se below.

No!!!! On the Althon box:
- nothing disabled in BIOS:
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/ - on-board primary channel
/deV/ide/host0/bus1/ - on-board secondary channel
- when I disable the primary channel I get this:
/dev/ide/host1/bus1/ - on-board secondary channel
So as you can see it moves!! From host0 to host1!

Yes that is a really cool advantage I now for months (over a year!)!
But here is the next example again:
The K6 server (on-board ALI-Aladin-5 + PCI-Card Promisse controller):
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/ - on-board primary channel
/dev/ide/host0/bus1/ - on-board secondary channel
/dev/ide/host2/bus0/ - Promisse primary channel
/dev/ide/host2/bus1/ - Promisse secondarychannel
So where is host1 ??????
(Maybe I should switch back to Mew as MUA to not let kernel-hackers
see the Sylpheed string in the mail-header :-((()

Only when disabled in the bios (but PLEASE look at the nice lists above
...)
