The last time I sent my patch to clean up CONFIG_EMBEDDED6xx and a few
other Kconfig options I still left it intact, but it becomes unnecessary
after that.
I still think that having high-level options like
* embedded6xx
  * MPC7448HPC2
  * holly
  * linkstation
* PPC_83xx
  * MPC8313_RDB
  * MPC832x_MDS
  * MPC832x_RDB
helps keep the platform selection more structured and readable, but the
dependency on !SMP should probably go into the individual platforms that
are actually broken, if any, not into the high-level option.
