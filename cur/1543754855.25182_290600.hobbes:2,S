eepro100 does a copy if pkt_len < rx_copybreak, otherwise it send up the
skb and allocates and links a new one in it's place (see
speedo_rx_link).
So I would say e100 and eepro100 are the same for >= rx_copybreak.  Why
does one work and not the other?  Is it because the RFD is aligned in
eepro100?
Russell, what happens with modprobe eepro100 rx_copybreak=0?
