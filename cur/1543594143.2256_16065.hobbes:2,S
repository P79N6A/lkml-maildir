Is this a known bug in tmscsim.o (2.0f, included with 2.2.19):
I have the following devices (cat /proc/scsi/scsi)

Often (but not always), on boot, I get Sync as "No" for the hard drive (Idx 
0). Doing "echo 'inquiry 0' > 0" always fixes the problem after boot but for 
some reason, the driver doesn't (always) pick up on this at boot time. It 
doesn't seem to matter if it's a boot up from power-off or soft reboot.
The drive, Seagate Hawk, support synchronous operation and sync negotiation.
