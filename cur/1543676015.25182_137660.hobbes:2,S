My system (SuperMicro) with an '875 and ICH5 reports the ICH5 as an 
'801EB' which means you should be using the i2c-i801 driver not i2c-i810...
I'm also betting that you need to set 'isich4' to true in the case of 
the ich5 as well...
Try the attached patch...  NOTE: I have *not* consulted the Intel DOC's 
on the ICH4 and ICH5 to see if the register interface has changed in 
other interesting ways...

Unfortuntately, the SuperMicro has a Winbond '627HF chip on the ISA bus 
and no other SMBus sensors, so the i2c-i801 support didn't help me much.
:v)
