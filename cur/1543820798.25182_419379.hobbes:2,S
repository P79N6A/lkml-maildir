What do you mean with real path? Even in open the path can be quite weird
("dir1/../dir2/../dir3/..." etc.)
I suspect it will always need to work with sanitized paths.
Starting from the dentry for that is a quite reasonable, although
d_path indeed seems quite inefficient without any caching mechanism.
