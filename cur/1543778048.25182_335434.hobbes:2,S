boot into a suspend-to-disk image?
i still see the real solution at least for "desktop" machines is to 
minimize the sheer amount of stuff loaded in the rc scripts.
at least for my use-every-day laptop (IBM T42), i've literally halved 
the startup time by being savvy about what services are started and in 
many cases not starting things until a few minutes after i've logged in.
for example, making use of NetworkManager sorts out a lot of the delay 
associated with dhcp and roaming WiFi connections - so there are no 
start-on-boot network kruft.
likewise, as a desktop its completely academic if sendmail starts at T+0 
seconds or T+2 minutes.
same for sshd/cups/httpd/ntpd et al.
of what does run, you CAN run it in parallel & hopefully get some sense 
out of the elevator being intelligent.
cheers,
lincoln.
