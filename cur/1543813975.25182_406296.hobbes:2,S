Did you read the "post Halloween document" describing changes from 2.4
to 2.6 or the LWN coverage of the 2.4->2.6 transition?  It's not
supposed to be a seamless upgrade...
udev must be working if ALSA works as it also depends on device nodes.
IIRC isapnptools is not needed if CONFIG_PNP is enabled.
