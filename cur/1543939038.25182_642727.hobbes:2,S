I said _reliably_.
Guess what happens on smp when one process will periodically overwrite
buf, and second will do the syscall?
It sucks for write, but it would suck much more for clone, where flags
drastically change the behaviour.
(Yep, it is possible to do reliably, see subterfugue, but it is a lot
of work and lot of overhead).

Works for me.
