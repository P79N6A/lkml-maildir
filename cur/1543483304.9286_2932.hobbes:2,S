If the MTU of the two links is different you should look for outgoing
frames through the router with no reply when the size of reply would be
large. Thats a clear indication that the remote site has firewalls set up
by overpaid underbrained morons from one of the many rich and clueless
consulting firms who think blocking all icmp on a firewall is a valid
thing to do.
