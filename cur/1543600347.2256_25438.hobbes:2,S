The SMP/UP difference is pervasive in Linux, I don't think there is a
single SMP-agnostic driver (as far as _binaries_ go). Source is mostly
SMP-agnostic.

And each SMP/UP aware operation _has_ to be a separate function (no inlines
allowed this way). Doable with not too much overhead, AFAICS (at least in
principle); but maintaining (and synchronizing) a clean split will soon be
a nightmare. Or end up in two separate kernels anyway ;-)

At least the #ifdef's isolate just the places that must be different in
both cases. It might be worthwhile to abstract them out from the source
(not necesarily from the binary kernel).
