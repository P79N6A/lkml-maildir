The minimum transaction size is one block (since ext3 is the only journaling
FS to log entire blocks, instead of the specific logical changes made during
the transaction), and your blocks are 1k, 2k, or 4k.
Though many times you'll have several blocks per transaction since each
transaction can change bitmaps, directory blocks, and etc.

Last I heard, ext3 will try to flush the journal with an async process and
if that isn't able to keep up, once the journal hits 50% full, the system
will write syncronously until the journal is empty (or was that until it was
25% full or less, I forget...).
AFAIK everyone agrees that this is not optimal, but nobody's taken the time
to fix it yet either.
