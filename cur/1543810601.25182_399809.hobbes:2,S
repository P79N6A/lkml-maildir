Subject: [PATCH] autofs4 - second try - set fields size for pipe packet
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have made almost all the changes recommended by Christoph.
I'm reluctant to change the type of autofs_wqt_t as it is part of the 
existing autofs4 struture. While such a change shouldn't cause a problem 
I'd rather not change what's been there for a long time just in case there 
are unexpected side effects.
