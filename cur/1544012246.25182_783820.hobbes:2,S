Hi Linus:
A regression has been reported where the new algorithm testing
infrastructure may cause the optimised versions of AES to fail
when it's built into the kernel (as opposed to as a module).
This is due to its use of shared AES tables that may not have
been initialised yet.  This has been fixed by pregenerating
the tables instead of having them computed at boot/run-time.
Please pull from

or
