Let me add that if the device that you're writing a driver for really
needs this, you can do a 
#define my_device_writel(x,y) __writel(cpu_to_be32(x),y)
at the top of the driver. 
I usually start out by doing that. And instead of giving along the IO
address, I give it the board-control-structure and the register
offset. So I usually end up with:
#define my_device_writel(x, bp, r) __writel((x), bp->base + r)
Convincing Linus that he's wrong (he's not) requires that you put an
identical define like that at the top of every driver that need
it. After a while just give him the patch that removes it from those
drivers and puts it in a central header file.
