One thing to check is that "make oldconfig" can actually change the
configuration if things were moved behind a new top-level configuration 
parameter or such. I'm not saying that's the case here, but it's possible 
that things like the i2c changes might have made you inadvertedly changed 
some config option.

It's a regression, although I'd like to know more about your cases. It's 
just hard to tell what happened: was it a i2c/hwmon driver that got 
broken, or is it some sysfs file that got buggered, or what..
For example, "dmesg" output before and after (preferably as a diff between 
the two), and what modules you had loaded in the working/nonworking case.
