Instead of excluding all these CPUs, simply put the
clock tick on the PerfMon interrupt. There's a bit-flip
that'll go at about 4 kHz on a system with a 100 MHz bus.
That should do. One need not change HZ; the interrupt
can be ignored whenever the timebase hasn't advanced
enough to require another clock tick.
