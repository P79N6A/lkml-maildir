yeah, this will work - and it's not a big chunk of RAM we are holding
onto, so we can keep it around indefinitely. I'll try it this way.
(the LIFO argument is not true once the proper per-CPU page caching
patches are integrated.)
(btw., the kernel has the same catch-22 problem as user-space's problem
with stack deallocation, with the difference that it's much easier and
cheaper to provide atomicity in kernel-space.)
