There's a patch from TEKRAM on their site which MIGHT help me, I'll try
it. Here's what it says:
Changes:
Set The "Processor Number Feature" Default to Disabled 
Update the RTC setup default year to 1999, if CMOS invalid 
****Program HDD UDMA mode 4 to UDMA 2 when use UDMA66 HDD, because PIIX4
not
support UDMA66 ***** <===== HERE
Set the setup default of "Video RAM Cacheable" item as "Disabled", for
Some VGA bugs
Software emulate RTC-level Y2K compatibility
