Hmm, are you sure this isn't a bios error misconfiguring
some northbridge register perhaps ?  Some chipsets offer
such reporting as a feature. Could be your server has this
on by default.
(I believe the EDAC code has also triggered similar cases
 on certain cards which is why it too disables this checking
 by default).

Why not make this automatic based on dmi strings, instead of
making the user guess that he needs to pass obscure command
line options?
The sysctl seems pointless too. If this is needed at all,
why would you ever want to turn it off ?
