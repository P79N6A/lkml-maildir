Whoa!  Hmm.
If I'm reading this right, with a processor speed of 1.666 GHz,
you're getting:
    (4096 bytes / 7815 clocks) * 1.666 GHz  =  873 MB/sec
The perfect peak performance of your setup, if the cache implements
standard write-allocate behavior (the target cache line is read before it
is written because the write logic doesn't know you're going to overwrite
the whole line in cases like this), should be:
    MIN( Memory speed / FSB speed ) / 3  =  700 MB/sec
So what gives?  Did I misinterpret the output of your program?
Is the test flawed?
