Hi All,
My kernel is crashing when i try to insmod a driver. I am getting 
the following error messages
insmod:19] Illegal instruction 000003e8 at c0015cf4 ra=c0088dd4
[[insmod:19] Illegal instruction c000d9d4 at c000b6a4 
ra=c000b69c
When i tried to locate this happens when i call rt_usleep 
function.
This is the piece of code where i call nano2count.
void mysleep (uint32 micro_sec)
{
    RTIME delay;
    delay = nano2count (micro_sec * 1000LL);
    rt_sleep (delay);
}
I am exactly getting the insmod error when there is a call to 
nano2count.
Note : RTIME is of type "long long".
The CPU i am using is IDT RC32334.
Can any body help me to solve this?
with best regards,
Nanda
