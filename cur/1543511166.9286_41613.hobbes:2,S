Yes it uses 8390.o as a base for pcnet_cs.o, which comes from
pcmcia-distribution. However, as you pointed out above, those error
messages come from 8390.o, so it cannot be a PCMCIA problem.

Well, there is not much I can do about it. Since the problem occurs when
the adapter is highly used, that is receiving/sending long files from my
laptop. Just running without data transfer does rarely show those errors.
However, it is _very_ hard to reproduce the conditions under which they
occur. I am looking after that now for quite some time. 
Probably I should add that I am connected to a really big ethernet, where
lots of things may happen. I also tried to connect my laptop directly to
another machine in order to reproduce the problem. But I noticed even more
errors which probably came from the other computer's card which uses the
tulip driver. So I am really stuck.

I don't think so as well. I have used for years a 3COM-card on this laptop
without any errors at all. This was under 2.0.x but then I changed the
card and the problems occured. 
 
BTW: from linux/drivers/net/8390.c
/* use 0 for production, 1 for verification, >2 for debug */
#ifndef ei_debug
int ei_debug = 1;
#endif
Maybe one should set it to 0 8)
