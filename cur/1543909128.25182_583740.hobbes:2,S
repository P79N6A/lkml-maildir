In fact, no.
PF_VM is used to know we have entered a virtual CPU (the hypervisor set it, the
scheduler unset it on accounting)
I mean a hook in account_system_time() to call a function arch-dependent to
compute the guest time (and modify the system/user time accordingly) if needed.
If fact what I find annoying in my patch is it adds to guest time and user time
some system time. Perhaps you could have a look to the second patch I sent.

Laurent
