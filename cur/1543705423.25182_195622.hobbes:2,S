| Here is a device driver for the IBM xSeries RSA service processor.
| The ibmasm driver is mainly intended to be used in conjunction with a user space 
| API and systems management applications that need to get in-band access to
| the service processor, such as sending commands or waiting for events.
| For the remote video feature the driver relays remote mouse and keyboard 
| events to user space. 
| By itself the driver also allows the OS to make use the UART on the service
| processor board as a regular serial line.
| 
| The user interface to the driver is a custom file system. It does not use sysfs since
| the operations on the files are somewhat beyond the one file / one value rule for sysfs.
| Since it is not strictly a char driver I put it into the drivers/misc directory.

| The patch is fairly big, therefore I split it up into the file system part and the
| everything-else part.

Hi,
Need to be consistent with spacing in "if" -- don't add spaces
on both sides of '(' and ')'.

Several good, like above....

| +{
| +	struct command *cmd;
| +	struct list_head *next;
| +
| +	if ( list_empty(&sp->command_queue) )

Nope, no cookie for this one and others below...

I'll try to look at more of it later today.
