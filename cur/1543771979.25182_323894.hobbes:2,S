Re-read the start of the thread :)
My suggestion...
short term:  do nothing
long term:  move drivers to a new pci_enable()/pci_disable() API which 
makes it easy for us to roll a lot of these singleton function calls, 
repeated over and over again in PCI drivers, into generic code.
Then just let evolution happen.  That way, progress occurs, but no 
existing drivers are broken by a sudden pci_enable_device() behavior change.
Since we're in a "rolling stable series" that might be a better path to 
take.  If evolution goes as expected, maybe there will no longer be any 
public users of pci_enable_msi()...
