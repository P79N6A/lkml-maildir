Sorry, all I have is anecdotal evidence.  The scope of the problem isn't
fully known.  Could be related to vendors implementing ACPI using SMM.
Vendors are tight lipped about which hardware is affected because it
understandably annoys users.
It's been a FAQ in Windows pro audio forums for years; digital audio
software vendors recommend disabling ACPI (on Windows this means
reinstalling with the legacy PC HAL) as a last resort if you can't get a
low enough latency on some hardware.
