*sigh*
I'm starting to think there is a special place in hell reserved for the 
folks at SimpleTech. This card has been giving me all kinds of trouble 
and this patch adds another one. It seems the card completely screws up 
multiple block writes. As little as two blocks at a time causes corrupt 
data on the card.
I've been digging through the specs I have to find some way of detecting 
cards like these but I haven't had any success. Hopefully there aren't 
too many of these out there. If the choice comes down to high speed or 
supporting non-compliant cards, then my vote is for speed.
