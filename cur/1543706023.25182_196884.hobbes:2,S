This is then a question of what we want it to do, and I assume that 
either of the obvious behaviours is not only possibe but practical. The 
question is if the objective is to make the data go away when the last 
link is removed, or to make removal of sach a file (unlink) remove the 
contents at the time of the unlink. I think the latter clearly implies 
allowing a single link to the inode.
Since I could make a case for either, I'd like to hear other feedback.

Given my use of the 'setgid' bit as a possible model, I would say that 
having new files created with the attribute is useful, and the user 
putting the attribute on the directory should control the content at the 
time the attribute is set. In other words it will be as useful if we 
just make it apply on files as they are created.

Yes, the person setting the attribute can control this. Unlike the 
setgid bit it can't be done (currently) as a part of creat().
