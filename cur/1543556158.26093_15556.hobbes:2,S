As the maintainer in question, I apologize.  I've been remiss in getting
a patch into 2.4 due to being focused on a new job.  My current plan is
to take Friday off and work on getting all of the various fixes people
have sent me glued together into one patch.  I must admit, though, that
I've been running 2.4.0-test kernels for quite some time and have not
had any problems activating my OPL3-SA3 card the old-fashioned way with
isapnp.

I'd rather that this patch not be applied in its current form, as there are
a few issues to be cleaned up.  For one, the following:
> +	sa2_cfg->io_base = pnp_dev->resource[0].start;
is incorrect.  The first value reported back by the ISA PnP driver is
the port for the unused SoundBlaster Pro implementation, not the SA2/3
control port (which is the 5th value).  Using a port in the SB port range
as the control port probably works most of the time, but there are some
weird laptops with this chipset, and there's a chance some of them might
not work.
Another overlooked issue (common to all the PnP patches I've been sent, I
think) is handling more than one card, as the SB PnP code does.  It would
be a bit of a pain to have to resort back to isapnp and module parms to
configure a second card.
Anyways, as I mentioned above, I'll try to get a more comprehensive patch
done and posted for testing sometime on Friday.
Scott
