Was the traceback I posted enough so someone can find out what's going
on or do you need more information?  I can hook up a serial console
and try to capture the full log, but I'm not sure I can reproduce this
kernel panic.  The dying hard drive is quite arbitrary when it comes
to showing errors or working fine...
