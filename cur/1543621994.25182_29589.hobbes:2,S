How about fixing the stuff you've already messed up (like putting the
drive present flags and the probe return back) ? The changes you made
to the init code also broke the framework so that 2.5 would eventually
let you do
	open("/dev/cdrom")
	read/write
	close("/dev/cdrom")
	open("/dev/sda")		/* Same device */
	burn a cd
without loading/unloading modules
I'm also confused how you plan to fix the hot swap case after your changes
because you've not allowed for the fact drives might be hot swapped while
you are suspended. The old code was careful to keep the hooks for that
ready.
Finally you forgot to update the MAINTAINER entry since you've now clearly
decided to walk over Andre and become the IDE maintainer
