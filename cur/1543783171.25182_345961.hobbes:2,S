Hmm OK, dirty memory is pinned pretty much exactly on dirty_ratio
so maybe I've just led you on a goose chase.
You could
     echo 5 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio
     echo 10 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
To further reduce dirty memory in the system, however this is
a long shot, so please continue your interaction with the
other people in the thread first.
Thanks,
Nick
