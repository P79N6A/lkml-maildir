If you do not need that 32 files on that embedded system, do not
enable that in config... I do not see what is wrong with two or three
files per led.

GPIO lines are obviously system specific, I guess they could go to
/proc or be controlled via ioctl()... But that was attempt at
universal LED interface, right?
