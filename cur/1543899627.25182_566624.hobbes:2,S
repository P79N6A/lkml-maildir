There might be other existing things with a semantics that might be 
worth looking at, e.g.:
I don't have an USB printer, but what happens if you unplug the printer 
while printing, wait 30 seconds, and plug it in again?
Wait 3 hours?
Could this work theoretically?
Does it work in practice?
This are non-theoretical use cases kernel and userspace already somehow 
handle today, and for userspace an USB printer disconnected for 3 hours 
and a 3 hour suspend might simply be the same with the latter not 
requiring any extra userspace handling.
Another example might be mounted NFS file systems:
The case that a client's ethernet cable gets unplugged for 24 hours and 
plugged in again is a real life use case NFS and all applications 
already have to handle.

But keep in mind that every piece that does not work transparently 
might result in less use cases for suspend.
There are cases like CD burning while suspending that might not be 
solvable, but as much as possible should work as transparently as 
possible.
