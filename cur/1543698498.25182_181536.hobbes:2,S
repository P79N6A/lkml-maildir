Sorry - it's not a hw problem, and in fact it's a problem with my slab
debugging patch: please don't use CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB together with my
crappy patch. My patch wants _only_ CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC instead of
using the SLAB debugger.
So please turn the slab debugger off, and depend on CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
entirely and try again,
