Seeing the path to disk relationship - yes (via proc for now, eventually
via sysfs).
Specifying from user space what path goes with what disk (explicitly): no,
that might require user level scanning.
Query a path - seeing and setting path states yes (via proc right now).
Using sg with a specified path - no, but on the TODO list.
I'm trying to pull the current multi-path patch up to 2.5.66 (ouch). 
The last functioning patch was against 2.5.59, some general info:

Or the patch:
