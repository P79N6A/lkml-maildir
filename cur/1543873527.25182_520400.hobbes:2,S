Yes, it's a simple solution. The reason I called it crap was because it
does what the other hacks do. It hides from the developer a dependency
that can create bugs in the other arch, and is not IMNSHO clean.
When one works on one arch, you should not need to be worried about
breaking other archs when you stay within the arch/ and asm-<arch>
directories.
