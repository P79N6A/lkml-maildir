Id like to see a benchmark that has a large footprint in the hash. A few
connection netperf run isnt going to stress the hash is it?
Also what page size were the runs done with? On x86-64 and ppc64 the 4kB page
size may make a difference to Brents runs.
specSFS (an NFS server benchmarmk) has been very sensitive to TLB issues
for us, it uses all the memory as pagecache and you end up with 10
million+ dentries. Something similar that pounds on the dcache would be
interesting.
