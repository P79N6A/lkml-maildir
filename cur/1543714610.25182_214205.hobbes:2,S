I guess I was thinking that if the kernel knew the status of the mounts, 
it could speed things up for userspace apps that don't properly handle 
network filesystems.  Probably not practical though.
We had an interesting time converting some apps that were originally 
using a ramdisk to run with NFS-mounted files.  Since reading from the 
ramdisk never blocked for significant amounts of time, some of the apps 
didn't design for IO delay and behaved poorly the first time we pulled 
the links to the NFS server.
