Because that is how any CPU with a MMU works.
All accesses to memory goes through page tables (virtual memory) -
there is no alternative. But this is not a problem, as the kernel can
map any physical address for you.

The way is to map the page containing that address.  You can
then read whatever you want from that page. Nothing is ever accessed
by physical address, physical addresses is only used indirectly
to set up the page tables.
