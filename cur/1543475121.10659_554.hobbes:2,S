also /sbin/hwclock and /sbin/hwclock -r hang, and when checking the bios
clock its off a few hours to a few days of what the software clock is. I
am running xntpd, but the error messages happen with out it running and
then the software clock is off too. This didn't happen with 2.0.36, but
did with 2.1.131 and 2.2.0pre[1-4].
I am running a K6 233 with a TXpro mother board, AWARD bios. Here's the
output from ver_linux, .config available on request.
