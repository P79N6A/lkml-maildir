Your approch was fragile (every arch is free to give you just 1 kmap in
the pool and you still must not deadlock) and it's not capable of using
the whole kmap pool at the same time. the only robust and efficient way
to fix it is the kmap_nonblock IMHO

This isn't the problem, if NFS wouldn't be broken it couldn't deadlock
against Lustre even with your design (assuming you don't fall in the two
problems mentioned above). But still your design is more fragile and
less scalable, especially for a generic implementation where you don't
know how many pages you'll reserve in mean, and you don't know how many
kmaps entries the architecture can provide to you. But of course with
kmap_nonblock you'll have to fallback submitting single pages if it
fails, it's a bit more difficult but it's more robust and optimized IMHO.
