first of all, please check if this still happens with 2.6.23, because we
had some patches in the area of the RFCOMM TTY code that might have
fixed this. Second, can you try without uswsusp or suspend2. Both of
them are not upstream and I can't tell how much these would effect this
kind of behavior.
