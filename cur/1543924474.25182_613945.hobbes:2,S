I figured out later by inserting printks into the driver that they
were being set from the command line, but without changing the
permissions there was no way to read them to verify.  The permissions
should at least be set to 0444 to allow them to be read.
IMHO the I2C_CLIENT_INSMOD macros could use some rework since they use
side effects to set variables without being explicit about it.
The real problem was unrelated to this, it was an off by one error in
the i2c bus numbering code of my embedded processor. That made the
parameters not work since I was setting them on a different bus.
Changed to 0444.
