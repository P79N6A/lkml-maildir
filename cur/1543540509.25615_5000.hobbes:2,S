That thought had crossed my mind... but I'm assuming there'd be some issues
related to the buffer cache while doing that. Secondly, I want the
replication to be N Way. For example:
If I write a file on host X, it's filtered over to host Y. Then, if I write
to host Y, it's filtered over to host X.
I'll give it a try, it can't break (much).
Thanks,
Jeff

why not just run raid1 over real disk and nbd?
