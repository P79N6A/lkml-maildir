THAT is exactly what both gettimeofday() AND the recommened interface do. 
Resolution will be to the TSC tick on x86.  Almost all archs provide at least 1 
microsecond resolution for both these clocks.
Even the x86 archs without a TSC have and have had, for some time, code which 
gives better than one microsecond resolution.
