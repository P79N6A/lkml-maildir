Well, then I've got somethings wrong going on because without kerneld my ppp
doesn't start at all automatically. Only if I modprobe it.
So why can't I get kmod working? Kmod is not a deamon, is it? If it is where
can I get it. I found some kmod.c in the source. (I conf.ed to use kmod!)

Why? I've got my parport on 0x378.
From linux/Documentation/devices.txt :
6 char  Parallel printer device
                  0 = /dev/lp0          First parallel printer (0x3bc)
                  1 = /dev/lp1          Second parallel printer (0x378)
                  2 = /dev/lp2          Third parallel printer (0x278)
                Not all computers have the 0x3bc parallel port; hence
                the "first" printer may be either /dev/lp0 or
                /dev/lp1            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At the end I could get it run and I still got my priter on lp1
 
Anyway, than you all for the fast answers.
Before sending you my mail I have! read linux/Documentation/parport.txt,
devices.txt. I haven't read Changes.txt. I have made those changes to
/etc/conf.modules
But that was not the source of the problem. Now I can print and use my parport
on lp1, 0x378. irq7
It is interesting that I am using lp without parport.
after modprobe lp lsmod only shows lp 2 0. No parports at all.
But I can print now normally. Is it normal? 
Problems with kmod: if I don't load kerneld for example ppp doesn't load
automatically when I want to ip-up.
Before modprobing lp I try to generate auto load lp and stuff but it didn't
happen. So what's now?
Would you be so kind as to help me?
I've got pgcc 1.1.1 amd k6 233, rh5.2.
