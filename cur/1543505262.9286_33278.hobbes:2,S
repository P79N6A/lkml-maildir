This tendency is for a time quantum only, what you are seeing is clearly at
a much larger timescale. And the other processes will also tend to stick to
the same CPU, I can very well imagine that with the right mix this gives
wandering processes when you use round-robin scheduling. Essentially the
explanation given for three processes, just longer ;-)

AFAIKS, if you see the effect, it is at a timescale of seconds. An unneeded
migration a second is not that big a deal, is it?
