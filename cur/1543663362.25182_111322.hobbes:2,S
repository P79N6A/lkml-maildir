I haven't checked for BIOS updates yet, we were planning to try a different 
brand of memory modules. The chipset is supposed to be able to support up to 
16GB. 8GB should definitely be supported by the default BIOS revision. I put 
4GB in it, and it boots up fine. 
Also, this has nothing to do with the fact that it runs slow when its up and 
running with 4GB.
