That should never stop us from doing the right thing :-), also dev->sem
isn't used nearly as much as for example work_struct which was changed.

Right, that is the only sort-of valid reason this has not been done yet.

I'm sceptical of this, since its a simple tree (as opposed to a balanced
tree) a simple lock-coupling approach should be enough to guarantee
consistency.

Sure, but once you have a parent's lock, you could unlock your
grandparent, no? (it having a locked child, your parent, should be
enough to guarantee its continued existence)

Seems like a weird rule, a typical tree locking rule would be to lock
them top-down - such a rule can easily cope with moves: lock old parent,
lock child, lock new parent, move child, unlock all in reverse order.

Like said, I think the tree locking model should be revisited. A
top-down locking model with lock-coupling should, from my ignorant
perspective, solve your problems.
