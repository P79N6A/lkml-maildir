Hi,
after switching from working 2.6.9-rc2 to -mm2, X refused to start on my 
testbox. It turned out this was because it failed (EPERM) reading from 
/dev/mem beyond the 1MB limit.
IMHO there is a typo in the test in devmem_is_allowed. The patch below 
fixed the issue for me. Despite I think it's pretty clear the logic there 
needs to be reverted, I'm somewhat uncertain because AFAICS nobody else 
complained so far - did I miss something?
