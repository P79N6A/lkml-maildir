No actually i don't want that for DMA it is for diffrent requirment.
actually in our device there is a page table in device which have
virtual to physical address translation we save virtual address in device
and corresponding physical address. but we can store only upto 44 bit
information of virtual address thats why i want that.
Can you help me in this
Thanks in advance
