Subject: [PATCH] Fix SH DMAC code to handle PVR2 cascade

Fix SH DMAC code to correctly handle PVR2 cascade DMA.
This updates 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/2/276
(I decided it was better to have the true size of the transfer put in
via the API and refactor this here. And calc_xmit_shift(chan) should
return 5 but only returns 3 so I've not used it here)
