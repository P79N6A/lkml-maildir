Subject: 2.1.131: revised patch `PPSkit-0.4.0pre1.diff.gz2'
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
although the feedback was not very positive (i.e. thare was hardly 
any), and the download statistics indicate poor interest (most from 
Japan, two from Germany, one from elsewhere), I worked further on the 
patch, completing the new architectures (arm and sparc64).
So a new patch is available at
ftp://pcphy4.physik.uni-regensburg.de/pub/wiu09524/PPS/PPSkit-
0.4.0pre1.diff.bz2
I really could need feedback on whether the thing works on all 
architectures. I'm not deeply involved with the kernel sources, so I 
might have missed one thing or the other.
If no-one complains until Christmas, I'll probably use my spare time 
then to make an official PPSkit-0.4.0. Then I'll see what should go 
into the standard kernel. Still, the corresponding patch for 2.0.X is 
out for over a year now, and nobody's system ever broke (as far as I 
got feedback).
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
Finally let me quote Dave Mills on his experience with car computers 
(ignition control, he started working for Ford it seems): "During a 
test drive on a freeway in Detroit, the computer was running in a 
makeshift rack in the back seat, with the programmer and I sitting 
alongside. Well, the program crashed and the car wheezed to a stop 
along the road; then, the engineer quickly reloaded the program from  
<a paper tape reader> and off we went. True story." Linux 2.1 can't 
be any worse it seems ;-)
