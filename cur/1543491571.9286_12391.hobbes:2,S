I tried to download linux-2.2.5.tar.gz from ftp.us.kernel.org also.
I left it running for several hours (we have a T1 link). There was no
response for several hours after I got about 3,000 bytes. There was
no activity to/from the server I could see on tcpdump although I could
ping it. When I aborted, ftp announced that it had been disconnected
(presumably some time ago).
Then I tried ftp.ca.kernel.org. I let this run since 9:00 this morning.
I got about 12,000 bytes in two hours. I aborted that. I am currently
downloading from ftp.fi.kernel.org and (just checked) It completed
correctly with a 14 kbytes/sec transfer rate.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
