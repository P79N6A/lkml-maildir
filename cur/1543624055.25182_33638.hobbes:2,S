Confirm. I only wanted to add that only 2.4.19pre2aa1 and vm-29 can
deadlock, all previous -aa kernels and vm-?? patches are rock solid
AFIK. The bug is just fixed, it was a missing UnlockPage. The bug was
introduced while fixing an highmem balancing thing (that nobody ever
reported on production machines so I don't consider such problem a
showstopper, but nevertheless vm-30 will fix both the new pratical and
the old mostly theorical problem).
