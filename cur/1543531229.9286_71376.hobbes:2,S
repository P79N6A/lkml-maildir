Where did you get that idea? This situation is "out of RAM+swap". No
RAM free, no swap free, nothing can be allocated. Nothing to do with
paging, either - you can shuffle the memory around fine, the problem
is just that there isn't enough to go round.

If they don't bother handling errors of either sort, they just get
terminated with a signal anyway. If they are careful enough to check
malloc() every time, they would handle SIGBUS as well.
