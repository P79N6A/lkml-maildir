With HTML the source format is itself the preferred object format for many 
purposes (something which I assume you wouldn't want to claim of DocBook 
source) meaning that for those uses there is no conversion.
Which given the number of times "make *docs" has bombed out on me through 
the years I find a definite improvement. Add in that it's much easier to 
produce HTML, that it covers most all formatting needs something like the 
kernel documentation directory needs, integrates unchanged, directly and 
nicely into the effort Rob Landley is doing with collecting documentation 
online and is a format you can read with a program most users have open and 
available 100% of the time rather than requiring a complete stack of 
semi-obscure external software -- and I just don't see why anyone would want 
to argue that DocBook and its associated crapola should _not_ be buried in 
that same dark, desolate place where other abortive attempts at improvement 
such as GNU info already reside.
Rene.
