That's perfectly fine by me.  I'll update the 2/3 patch to use these names.
Also, I think we can remove acpi_enter_sleep_state_s4bios() entirely (in a
separate patch).

The _SST after _BFS is okay, but the invocation of _SST in acpi_wake()
(currently acpi_leave_sleep_state) is problematic, since it causes the
indicator to be set to "working" during hibernation, before the image is
saved.  Thus, during hibernation _SST shouldn't be called from acpi_wake().
For this reason, I thought it would be a good idea to call _SST from a separate
routine that might be invoked by higher level functions as desired.
