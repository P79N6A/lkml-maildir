So "Say 'y' not 'm' to SCSI disk support." as Tejun Heo suggests works.
isn't it kind'of a regression though ? Distro 2.6.18.1 kernel works with
modular disk support.
Also why does it want to load both ata_generic and pata_amd ? Shouldn't
pata_amd be sufficient if it works on my chipset ?
Attaching new dmesg & config in the interest of science :)
