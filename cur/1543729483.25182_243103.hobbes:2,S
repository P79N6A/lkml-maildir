I've been pushing for a large giant UML merge for ages, mostly as
nobody is looking over the broken down patches much anyhow...
I'd even be happy with the current stuff being shoved into mainline
even if it doesn't build for a few days until it gets fixed --- not
having a common point of reference is really quite frustrating.
There are a ton of white-space cleanups and sparsification changes
that could be done too --- I assume this would be best done *before* a
giant-patch merge?
