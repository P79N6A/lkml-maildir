Hi, Vitaly, I added you on cc: for the 2.6 cleanup. Please double-check
what I'm doing there and use it for your 2.4 version. I hope my intentions

The fundamental reason why you cannot lock a free-able structure with
an in-structure lock is this. Imagine thread A locks in order to process
a disconnect. Thread B wants to open and waits for the lock. Notice that
the struct is not open, so thread A frees it. At this point, thread B
is using a freed memory.
The solution is to lock the instance struct dev with dev->mtx, except
for the open count, which is locked by a static lock (I'm ignoring
interrupts here, which cannot use mutexes).
I'm sorry to say, you're quite right: a number of drivers in 2.4 got
it wrong, and some (like adutux) carried it through 2.6.23.
