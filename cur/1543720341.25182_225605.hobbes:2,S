Not that easy. It wasn't as easy for atkbd either. This isn't just a
case of locking - it's making sure you always know whether the next byte
is data from the keyboard/mouse or a command response.
Only after getting the first ACK you can be sure that the keyboard/mouse
will not be sending any scancodes/movement data.
