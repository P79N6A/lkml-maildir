At the end of the overnight run with about 16,600 cycles another block has
been added, bringing the directory up to 397312 bytes.  The four points I
have now make a nice logarithmic curve, i.e., the slope seems to fall off so
rapidly that there is not a lot to worry about here.  All the same, I should
code a more efficient test and run a few billion cycles.  Or perhaps that
same effort would be better spent working on the coalesce, which will turn
this into a moot point.
