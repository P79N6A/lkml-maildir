For System-on-Chip devices it can be a fine line.  Maybe six
of the most important devices (including CPU) are in a low
power state, but some others are still active.

Pavel, remember that great big "wakeup" shaped hole in the
current PM framework... ?  Even ACPI sleep states support
wakeup mechanisms, although not well under Linux (yet).
One way a sleeping system could take a call is if some
external chip raised a wakeup-enabled IRQ to wake up the
system.  And if going from deep sleep to normal operational
state has a low cost, why shouldn't the system routinely
enter deep sleep instead of going to CPU idle state?
It's certainly the case that connecting the USB device
to a host can un-gate that peripheral's 48 MHz clock and
wake the system up from deep sleep.
