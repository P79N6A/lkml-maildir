Another issue is that if you keep them in order, you have to fix the
list whenever an owner of a listed mutex changes its priority.

Yes.  However, the contention case should not be optimized at the
expense of the common case, which can be faster for non-rwlock
implementations when PI is involved.  On SMP, you'd be introducing a
bottleneck by taking away rwlocks, but on UP it's only an issue when
you get preempted or block in a critical section.
There could be problems if some code tries to acquire read locks
out-of-order, believing that it can't deadlock that way (if the
writers don't nest), but that's a problem anyway unless there's a
reasonable way of implementing PI without limiting the number of
concurrent readers (they have to be stored somewhere, and the
alternatives of setting a hard limit on mutexes-per-thread or doing
dynamic allocation inside the lock function are worse).
