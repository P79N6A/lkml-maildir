Are you completely ignoring that nobody in this thread cares about libscg's 
ability to work with other devices? The problem is in the user-interface, and

cdrecord contains the UI, so it is the only program relevant to the problem. 
If libscg is impeding fixing the bug (I don't think it is, but you seem to), 
then maybe cdrecord should use transport.hxx from growisofs.
