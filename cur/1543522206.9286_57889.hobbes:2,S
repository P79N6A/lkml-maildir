	No, but I am sure that blocks of hosts have been added to the ORBS list
because their provider chose to block the ORBS probes.

	That's not the point. The point is that ORBS claims to be a list of
validated open mail relays, and it's not. It's not supposed to be a list of
people who deserve anything in particular. I'm sure if you talk to the
people who have chosen to block ORBS, you will find that they have their
reasons.
