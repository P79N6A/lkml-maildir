Could you cc myself or parisc-linux@parisc-linux.org in future please?
first, you've called it `compact_sys_ioctl' -- it should be `compat_sys_ioctl'.
it's compatible, not really small ;-)
second, you've not changed the definition in arch/parisc/kernel/syscall.S:
-	ENTRY_DIFF(ioctl)
+	ENTRY_COMP(ioctl)
