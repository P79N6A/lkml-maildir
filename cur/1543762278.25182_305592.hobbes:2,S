What architecture is this on? On many CPUs it is not possible to enforce 
a write-only memory area in most cases (there is no way to give write 
permissions without giving read permissions).

Likewise, many CPUs cannot enforce execution restrictions separate from 
read restrictions (x86 CPUs are like this, except for the latest ones 
with NX support, or if you're using a kernel patch like exec-shield that 
tries to emulate this support).
