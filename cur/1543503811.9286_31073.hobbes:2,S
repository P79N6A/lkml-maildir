Linux as it is can perfectly handle flanging at a one sample delay!
If you have flanging with intersignal delays in the range from 1 sample
to 1024 samples the overall delay must be at least 1024 samples to be
able to
implement flanging (adding the signal to itself with a variable delay).
Only if flanging is to be done directly from a microphone to a
loadspeaker
does the problem become interresting iff you need to minimize the delay
the signal spends in the computer. Here you must work very close to the
hardware,
eg, mmap and I do not think RTlinux helps here.
I think flanging is a bad example in this discussion as flanging is not
very CPU-intensive. Try running a 1024 point FIR filter instead :-)
