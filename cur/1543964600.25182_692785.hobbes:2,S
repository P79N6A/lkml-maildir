Yes, will do.  The reason for the cleanup is the following patch
defines PG_memerror, but only on configs with extended page flags.
So checking them in page_alloc.c would require adding #ifdef, which
would be rather ugly.  Moving the definitions into page-flags.h
allows the #ifdef to be in the header file rather than the C code.
From page.discard.v4:
+#ifdef CONFIG_PAGEFLAGS_EXTENDED
+PAGEFLAG(MemError, memerror)
+#define        PAGE_FLAGS      (PAGE_FLAGS_BASE | 1UL << PG_memerror)
+#else
+PAGEFLAG_FALSE(MemError)
+#define        PAGE_FLAGS      (PAGE_FLAGS_BASE)
+#endif

I'll make those changes.
