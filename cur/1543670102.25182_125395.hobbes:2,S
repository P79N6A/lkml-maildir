It's an Alpha with 768 MB.  Is it the pci_alloc_* functions you are
referring to?  I don't think they are used currently. How much memory
can these allocate?  I need chunks of up to 1 MB, not necessarily
phycically continuous.
What do those functions do that normal memory allocation does not?
Apart from setting up sg mappings, that is.
