           Summary: 3c59x won't work at all with 2.6.0-test kernels.
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0-test4-mmX to 2.6.0-test8-mm1
            Status: NEW
          Severity: blocking
             Owner: jgarzik@pobox.com
         Submitter: kl@vsen.dk
Distribution: Gentoo Linux
Hardware Environment: IBM Thinkpad X20 - miniPCI 3com network:
lspci with 2.4.22 kernel:
 00:0a.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c556B Hurricane CardBus (rev 20)
Software Environment:
glibc-2.3.2, gcc-3.2.3 - anything else? 
Problem Description:
My 3c59x miniPci network card won't work at all with 2.6.0-test kernels.I think
I've seen it work once, with an old 2.6.0-test kernel, but I'm not sure, and
I've tried all the way back to 2.6.0-test3, and can't reproduce it (working that
is).
the Hardware mac address is set to all FF's on 2.60. ifconfig works fine - I
just can't ping anything.
with 2.4.22 it all works like a charm.
Steps to reproduce:
compile 2.6.0-testX with 3c59x as module or built-in.
