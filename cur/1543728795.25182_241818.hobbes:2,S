You're right. It's not a kernel bug at all. Up until fedora kernel 
2.6.6, binfmt_misc was compiled as a module, and was loaded only when 
the wine script was run. When they changed it to compiled-in in kernel 
2.6.7, they should have provided a script as part of the upgrade 
process. I've suggested that via bugzilla. Don't know if they will 
implement it.
