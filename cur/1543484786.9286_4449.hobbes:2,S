It is going through the roof and killing my machine with OOM without update,
but I see that Linus' point about update is valid also.
Just to add. If I run my hog in wrong time (e.g. just after update synced disk,
and sleeps for another 5 sec), I have whole 5 sec to grow inodes,
then update wakes up and growing stops:
mordor:~$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
4844    3       1       0       0       0       0
(limit is still 2048)
It is a pity that I lost 2.5 times more memory that I supposed to and I have
no way to reclaim it back. 4844 inodes is somewhat more than I need at home
and I need to *reboot* to get that memory back!

Oops!!! I have update running, but inodes still leaks with this proggy.
mordor:~$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inode-state
33754   7       1       0       0       0       0
mordor:~$ ps ax | grep update
   10 ?        S      0:01 /sbin/update
mordor:~$ uname -a
Linux mordor 2.2.2 #38 Sat Feb 6 13:28:17 MSK 1999 i586 unknown
This is clean 2.2.2-pre2
Bye,
