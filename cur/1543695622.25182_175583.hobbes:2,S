This "still broken" is too unspecific, 3c59x + ACPI works for me, in a
Gigabyte 7ZX-R (VIA KT133 based) mainboard, with SuSE 8.2 distro kernel
(ACPI 20030228), 2.4.22-pac1+acpi patches, and with latest 2.6.0-test9
BK.
I have two 3C905 and one 3C900Combo in a production router, everything
is the old "Boomerang" chip version. Rest assured I WOULD know if these
lost IRQs or were otherwise misconfigured.

Might the problems you observe be related to the IBM BIOS?
