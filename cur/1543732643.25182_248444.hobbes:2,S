The only way curent way to enter the kernel from glibc with a fastcall is
the EPC.

The EPC call already does do a *secure* transfer like this on IA64 and
will execute kernel code without user space mapping. This idea raises all sorts
of concerns....

The functions in the timer source structure is a central problem for IA64. We
cannot take that out right now.
The full parameterization of timer access as I have suggested also allows
user page access to timers with simply mapping a page to access the timer.
No other gimmicks are needed since the timer source structure contains all
information to calculate a timer offset.

The simplest thins is to provide a data structure without any functions
attached that can simply be copied into userspace if wanted. If an arch
needs special time access then that is depending on the arch specific
methods available and such a data structure as I have proposed will
include all the info necessary to implement such user mode time access.
A requirement to call functions in the kernel to determine time makes
these solution impossible. And its getting extremely complex if one has to
invoke different functions for each timer supported.
