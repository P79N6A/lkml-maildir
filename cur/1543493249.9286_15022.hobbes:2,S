I looked through the changes from -ac1 to -ac7, and found nothing
that could be causing this behavior... Nothing changed in ide relevant
sections or ide-scsi, for that matter. Is this with the same config?
You didn't enable DMA or something in between?
Doug, I also checked the sg updates and the change is really miniscule.
If the config options didn't change between the two runs, I'm baffled...
