I agree that it can cause problems, but it's up to the modules themselves
to determine how to combine permissions with their immediate secondary
module.
Instead we now have a static LSM where combining features from one module
means duplicating it in another - then when two modules contain most of
the other's code, but perhaps vastly different configuration mechanisms,
someone will propose removing one of the two...
