look for the following code:
           /* retry once again? */
            if(--retry > 0) {
                schedule();
                goto retry_here;
            }
change schedule() to udelay(50) and see if things are 'better'.
>Is was happened on 2.4.29, too. It is a interrupt problem?
its calling a routine that might sleep while in the transmit routine.
this is not allow.
