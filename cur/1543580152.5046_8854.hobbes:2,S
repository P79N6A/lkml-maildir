Andreas,
I've checked the bootsector (aka superblock) [i hate od...]
and found no problems. It even gives the right info about
start sector and length (same as fdisk).
Your filesystem seems to be intact, but I'd suggest running
sp^Hcandisk although. Maybe there are other things like a
corrupt FAT the driver complains about.
AFAIK it only ought to complain if the bootsector (BPB and
55AA magic) is corrupt. (Or did so in 2.0.33)
Sorry can't help, seems to be a fs-driver flaw.
