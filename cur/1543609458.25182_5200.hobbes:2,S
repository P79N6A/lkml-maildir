A while back (2.2.*) it was possible to fake a network connection
coming down, by using for example sockdown, from the netpipes packae,
on sockets in /proc/nnn/fd/n.
This was very handy to avoid having to wait for a timeout, if something
bad happened to the server at the other end.
I've now tried it with 2.4, and find that it now doesn't work.
Is this a bug or a feature?
