   I've had similar problems with the 2.3.x series. I believe I posted a
comment saying so to this mailing list. Basically I'll get crashes on an
SMP machine when accessing two different IDE busses simultaneously. It
used to happen instantly with earlier kernels, now it sometimes takes half
an hour to occcur. It still makes these kernels unusable as 2.2.x never
did this. I'm using a Promise Ultra66 controller with one IBM Deskstar on
each channel.
   This doesn't sound exactly like your problem but it sure does sound
suspiciously similar.
   I doubt it's the IDE code for the Promise card itself as I did a diff
of a kernel that had this problem and a kernel that didn't and the actual
IDE drive C file changed in a totally trivial manner.
