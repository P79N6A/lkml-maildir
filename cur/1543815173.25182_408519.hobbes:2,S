Subject: [PATCH 045/141] V4L/DVB (3271): Update tuner comments
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Right now, all tuners are using the first tuner_params[]
array element for analog mode. We are now ready to begin merging
similar tuner definitions together, such that each tuner definition
will have a tuner_params struct for each available video standard.
The tuner_params[] array element will be chosen based on the video
standard in use.
