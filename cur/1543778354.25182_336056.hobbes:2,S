We're working on it. On the topic of revamping LTT, 3 different people
came up with 3 different implementations.
Following your feedback on the patch I sent a few weeks back, I headed
out asking myself "what is the bare-minimum tracing functionality that
will actually fly while still being flexible enough to add to it?" I
spent some time at the OLS comparing notes with others interested in this
area, and I think we've got something that should fit the bill. We should
be able to post something sooner rather than later.
Now if only I could remember what I talked about after I left the Black
Thorn at 2h45am and the guy in the elevator at Les Suites pressed on a
button and said "'M' for more beer" ...
Thanks,
Karim
