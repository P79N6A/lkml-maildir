Hi Alan,
I've made a new page aging patch, this time against 2.4.9-ac14;
this one has two added features over the patch against 2.4.9-ac12:
1) uses min()/max() for smaller page_age_{up,down} functions
2) if we have no free shortage, don't waste CPU time trying
   to enforce the inactive target but rely on background
   scanning only
You can get the patch (a bit large for email) at:

Please apply for the next 2.4.9-ac kernel, thanks.
regards,
Rik
