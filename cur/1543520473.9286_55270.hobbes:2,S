Hi Gurus,
    This is regarding linux source code, right now I am going through
it, I have reached the
void init ( void * unused );
From here /bin/init or /bin/sh are called. If anybody nows where can I
find /bin/init 's source code then please tell me the URL or the
directory in /usr/src/linux/ .
Thanking in anticipation.
-GAURAV.
