I missed an email from Promise which supplied even more chipset docs to 
open.  Whoops.  The entire line supported by sata_promise.c should now 
be open:
2037x:
http://gkernel.sourceforge.net/specs/promise/pdc2037x
%20series%20development%20guide.pdf.bz2
20319 (updated link, updated doc):
http://gkernel.sourceforge.net/specs/promise/pdc20319
%20development%20guide.pdf.bz2
205xx (the newer NCQ chips):
http://gkernel.sourceforge.net/specs/promise/pdc205xx
%20development%20guide%201.0.pdf.bz2
Cheers,
	Jeff
