Performance will probably be bad on K7 Athlons - those have a microcoded
movnti which is quite slow.
Also BTW I don't see any code anywhere that tests the CPUID bits,
so your code will fail spectacularly on a PII that didn't do SSE
(intel user copy used to be enabled on those) 
One way to solve this might be to use different code using
alternative()
