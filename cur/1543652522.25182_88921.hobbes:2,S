Alan / All,
	I assume this is the patch that's been in your -ac kernels for a 
while?  I have an Intel 845GBV board which uses the ICH4 architecture.  
I'm happy to report that this patch does allow me to use the integrated 
sound on this motherboard, but one thing that I've noticed is that it 
seems as though to adjust volume you need to adjust the actual channel 
(PCM, CD, etc), rather than main volume.  Any ideas why this might be so?
Brian
