Today is not being a good day.
This bug was already fixed.   The following mistakes were made:
a) Jan's patch was misleadingly titled "coda: avoid lockdep warning in
   coda_readdir"
b) Jan's patch had no changelog
c) Jen's patch was not cc'ed to any mailing list
d) Al's patch was not sent to the maintainer.  Nor to me.  Nor was it
   staged in any tree which I can get at so that I could inform people of
   the upcoming conflict/duplication/etc.
Guys (and I mean all guys): things are really shit at present.  Please try
to do better.
