Hi!
Is there a problem mounting loop or devices not in the /etc/fstab?? If I don't
provide -t fs, the mount is on state D and hangs -- its not that bad, the
machine reboots often enough ;)
That Problem is common to 2.2.1 and 2.2.1-ac5 :(
*I* didn't find the bug (even not browsing the patches;)
Bye, Nils
