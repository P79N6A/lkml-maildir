+The following is a list of files and features that are going to be
+removed in the kernel source tree.  Every entry should contain what
+exactly is going away, why it is happening, and who is going to be doing
+the work.  When the feature is removed from the kernel, it should also
+be removed from this file.
+
+---------------------------
+
+What:	devfs
+When:	July 2005
+Files:	fs/devfs/*, include/linux/devfs_fs*.h and assorted devfs
+	function calls throughout the kernel tree
+Why:	It has been unmaintained for a number of years, has unfixable
+	races, contains a naming policy within the kernel that is
+	against the LSB, and can be replaced by using udev.
+Who:	Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com>
