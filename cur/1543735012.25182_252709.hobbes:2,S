The thing I think is missing in all this is that, in some platforms, the 
hardware to provide the interrupts is more accurate.  We have, IMHO, three cases 
here:
a) The interrupts are accurate but the clock info (e.g. TSC) is not.
b) The clock in accurate but the timer is not, and
c) The clock and interrupt come from the same accurate hardware source.
The X86 is in class a) in that the PIT is accurate and the TSC is not.  The 
muddy part here is the pm-timer which is accurate but takes a _long_ time to access.
PPCs are in class c) as are some MIPS, ARM, and PARISC.  I am not sure about the 
rest and can not lay my hands on one of class b).
For the class a) machines, I think the best approach is to use a clock that has 
reasonable short term accuracy and to use the timer to, from time to time, 
correct it.  This should be on the order of an internal NTP sort of correction.
For the class a) and b) machines, I think it would be wise to not seperated the 
timer and the clock so much as to make it "hard" to use one to correct the other.
