Don't stress the _ALWAYS_ too much. On Linux/SPARC and Linux/SPARC64 the
syscalls are inserted at the yet unused positions which are at random places
in the syscall table. Many syscall numbers were chosen to match SunOS syscall
numbers (which uses a different personality now but it was not like that
when SparcLinux started) and for backward compatibility this cannot be
changed now.
