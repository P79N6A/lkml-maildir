Hi Justin,
After some more testing i have good news to report.
I am currently running kernel 2.6.0-test4 with aic7xxx driver.
The solution to my earlier problem was in SCSI-Select Utility under
Advanced Settings tab.I have never changed any options under the
AHA-2940U2W bios 2.57.2 but this time i've changed BIOS Support for
Int 13 Extensions from Enabled (default) to Disabled.That made all the
difference when the adapter is probed.
I have a question related to this setting, will this affect anything
when set to Disabled? Perhaps there's something in the driver that
prevents the Int 13 extention from functioning properly?
I can provide .config,dmesg output or verbose messages if needed.
Thank you for helping thus far.
Regards,
Paul
