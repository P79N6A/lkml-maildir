Fixed a USB powered (two USB plugs) Genesys based 2.5" HDD enclosure with 
extra 5V supply bypass capacitors, the HDD was shutting down without loss 
of data with a 'soft' 5V supply.  Now USB drive works everywhere except a 
laptop with a single USB.  HDD uses 700mA, USB is spec'd 500mA per socket.
Some bugs are the hardware :o)
