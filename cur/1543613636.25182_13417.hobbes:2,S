Note that I've reverted the kill(-1...) thing in my personal tree: so far
I've gotten a lot of negative feedback, and the change doesn't seem to
actually buy us anything except for conformance to a unclearly weasel-
worded standards sentence where we could be even more weasely and just say
that "self" is a special process from the systems perspective.
