You read fast ;)
So you do _not_ want to consider nested sched domains, just disjoint
ones.  Good.

My evil scheme, and Dinakar's as well, is to provide a way for the user
to designate _some_ of their cpusets as also defining the partition that
controls which cpus are in each sched domain, and so dividing the
system.
  "partition" == "an arbitrary disjoint set of sets of cpus"
This fits naturally with the way people use cpusets anyway.  They divide
up the system along boundaries that are natural topologically and that
provide a good fit for their jobs, and hope that the kernel will adapt
to such localized placement.  They then throw a few more nested (smaller)
cpusets at the problem, to deal with various special needs.  If we can
provide them with a means to tell us which of their cpusets define the
natural partitioning of their system, for the job mix and hardware
topology they have, then all is well.
