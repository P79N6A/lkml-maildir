ENOIOCTLCMD is something I've never met in the kernel. Normal reaction
to unrecognized ioctl() is ENOTTY, for a lot of reasons, starting with
the fact that ioctls are last-ditch API to be used when you just can't
think of better one and historically TTY had the earliest (and largest)
infestation. IOW, "not a tty" used to mean "WTF are you using ioctls here?"
OTOH, EINVAL is a catch-all thing for "something is wrong with arguments".
