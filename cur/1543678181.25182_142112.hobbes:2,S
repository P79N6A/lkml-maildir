Is there a reason to use the zlib and nothing but the zlib for the
cryptolib?  RFCs 1950 - 1952?  Or would any form of compression do, in
principle at least?
In the worst case, I consider it not too hard to add a wrapper
interface to the zlib to do the scatter-gather handling.  Actually
going deeply into the guts of the zlib is not good for a kernel
hackers sanity though.  The massive use of macros with magic knowledge
of the surrounding functions is - well - interesting.
