Yeah, this is the wrong fix. I have a proper one in the repo that I'll
sync to Linus this week.
Point is, we need to ignore SIGTERM because init will send it during
shutdown, and that will kill these threads making it impossible to
unmount/sync sbp2 disks during the shutdown/reset process. My patch sets
a variable and then signals the semaphore in the thread, which checks
the variable and shuts down at that time.
