Ok, I see that now.  I guess my only remaining question is why do child 
busses not get their own struct device, but rather only a pointer to the 
bridge's struct device?  There's no refcounting done on this, ie: no 
pci_dev_get/put calls, but I guess that's kinda ok, since we're pretty 
sure that the child bus won't exist for longer than the bridge that owns 
it, right?  So using the bridge's struct dev allows the pci topology to 
look cleaner?  As in, there's no actual bus exposed in sysfs/procfs/etc, 
just devices that seem to be hanging off the bridge?
Cheers!
