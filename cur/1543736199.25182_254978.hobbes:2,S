I think it has little sense in restoring value from the configuration
space to dev->irq or clearing it.
If we do preventive programming, it may be worth
trying to define some magic constant (e.g. PCI_UNDEFINED_IRQ) and
panic/BUG when the irq is being enabled.
Otherwise, leaving dev->irq as it is would be ok.
