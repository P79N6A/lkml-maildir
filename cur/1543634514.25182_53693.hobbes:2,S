You don't _understand_.
If it's "free", you take that 70% for the second CPU, and the additional
20% for the next two.
Don't bother repeating yourself about Amdahls law. Realize what Moore's
law says: things get cheaper over time. A _lot_ cheaper.
It's still a fact that people are willing to pay for performance. Even if
they strictly don't "need" it (but who are you or I to say who "needs"
performance?).
At which point it doesn't _matter_ if you only get 70% or 30% or 12%
improvement. If it's within "cheap enough", people will buy it. In fact,
once it gets "too cheap", people will buy something more expensive just
because a cheap PC obviously isn't good enough. That's _reality_.
Your "efficiency" arguments have no basis in the real life of economics in
a developing market. Only embedded people care about absolute cost and
absolute efficiencies ("it's not worth it for us to go for a more powerful
CPU, since we don't need it"). The rest of the world takes that 66MHz
improvement (in a CPU that does multiple gigahertz) and is happy about it.
Or takes the added 12%, and is happy about it.
Humans are not rational creatures. We're _rationalizing_ creatures, and we
love rationalizing that big machine that just makes us feel better.
