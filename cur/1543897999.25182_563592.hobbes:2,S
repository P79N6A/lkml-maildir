If this helps, here is the version information.
Stable LFS (version 6.2, released on August 3, 2006) tells users to download 
man-pages 2.34 (two releases old at that time). LFS-6.3 is expected to be 
released in two months or so, thus a one-year period before moving tarballs 
to "Old" should be enough even for stable LFS books (and if we agree on 
that, I'll close 
http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/ticket/2037
 as invalid).
Thanks for cooperation.
