But what about 0-byte files? The block offset could be the same for all
0-byte files, or worse, it could be the same as the block offset of a
non-0-byte file.
I don't know if this has been mentioned before, but since a directory
record is always 34 bytes or bigger, why not simply divide the directory
record byte offset by 32? I.e.,
-   inode_number = (bh->b_blocknr << bufbits) + offset;
+   inode_number = (bh->b_blocknr << (bufbits - 5)) + (offset >> 5);
