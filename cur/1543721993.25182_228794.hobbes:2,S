I always test new kernels with all debug enabled just in case. If 
everything is ok I recompile them without debuging. And sometimes I use 
rsync before I recompile and I never experienced such problems so I think 
something was changed.

Yes, of course. Maybe there should be bigger warning in make config about 
this option? Btw. many debug options have very short help (if any) not 
saying how bad they interract with speed and memory. Maybe there should be 
some submenu with "mad" debug options only for insane people :)?

Thanks, I will test it soon and I will report results. But I am not saying 
it is a bug - maybe it is simply change that can lead to problems with 
insane debug options but itself is good?
Thanks,
