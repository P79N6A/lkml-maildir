Nope. As far as I understand it, CONFIG_NFSD_SUN (CNS) affects the
export of local mount points. Let me explain:
If you have CNS enabled (disabled), your /usr lies on a sep. fs and you
export /usr, then the NFS client gets to see the files that are masked
so to speak by mounting /usr, i.e. the files that reside in /usr *prior*
to mounting the real /usr onto it.
If you have CNS disabled (enabled), then the NFS client gets to see the
fs as the local user sees it.
Hope that was right :-)
