Hello,
Got problems with CFS after a kernel upgrade from 2.6.20 to 2.6.23. 
After a certain amount of time since cattach i get:
ios:~$ ls /opt/clear/
ls: /opt/clear/: Not a directory
stracing the command i get stat64() returning ENOTDIR.
Applications won't find the directory.
If i cd into it and ls it is like doing a refresh: everything works 
again for a certain amount of time, then, again. It reminds me an old 
version of CFS which used to claim: 'stale NFS file handle'.
I didnt see any NFS changes in the changeslog of 2.6.23.1 so i decided 
to POST.
SOmebody can help ?
TIA
Gianluca
