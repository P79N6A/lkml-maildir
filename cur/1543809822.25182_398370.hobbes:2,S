I'll have to dig through my archives to confirm this one.

That's a possibility, except that programs today expect CRTSCTS to
enable RTS/CTS flow control.
What I suggest is to use CRTSCTS to enable the chosen flow control
method.  Then we have a set of cflag bits which describe the flow
control mode, eg CFLOWRS485, CFLOWMODEM, CFLOWALT (probably needs
better names.)  CFLOWMODEM being the conventional mode should have
an all zeros value.
