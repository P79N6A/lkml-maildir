Ahh, I think it's just underflowing the preempt count somewhere, which
is leading highmem.c:15 to just *think* it is in an interrupt.
But you aren't running a preemptible kernel, which makes it unusual...
it would have to be coming from interrupt code (or just random corruption).
Still, preempt debugging should catch those cases as well.
So, can you disregard my last message, and instead compile a kernel
with CONFIG_PREEMPT and CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT, and see what
messages come up?
Thanks,
Nick
