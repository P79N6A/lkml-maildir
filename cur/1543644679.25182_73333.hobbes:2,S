I tend to agree - I like either of the models:
a bunch of little single-value files that can be polled and read
  or
a single device_event file that a daemon reads and dispatches events (I 
like this one because the daemon is already written, just poorly named - 
acpid)
For things like netif_carrier, poll() is probably best - the DHCP client 
can be fully self contained, and not need an eventd to alert it to a 
signal change.  Of course, acpid does support UNIX socket connections 
from apps like DHCP....
