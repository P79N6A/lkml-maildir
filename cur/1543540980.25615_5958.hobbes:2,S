	Minor clarification.  I didn't use the word "should" anywhere in my post.  
I simply described the current behavior of 2.2.16.
	Deciding if the behavior should be changed is not a discussion of
'correct' vs. 'incorrect' behavior.  It's a discussion of current behavior
and proposed different behaviors.
