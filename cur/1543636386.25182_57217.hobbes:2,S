This could possibly be a problem with your hard drive.  Judging 
from the model number, you have a 45GB IBM DeskStar 75GXP, one 
of the first IBM drives to earn the nickname "DeathStar" for its 
high failure rate.  What does IBM's Drive Fitness Test tell you?
I'll see about performing your test tonight; I've got a hefty 
little DivX directory I can throw around as I wait for 
j2sdk-1.4.0 to finish compiling.  Such a test should be 
sufficient...
This could also be a recurrence of ye olde VIA686B PCI+IDE issue.  
IIRC, some VIA686B motherboards that had that flaw were 
effectively unfixable, simply because certain motherboard 
manufacturers spotted the problem before everyone else (even 
VIA?) and tried their own partial kludge fixes for it.  Gotta 
love VIA.
