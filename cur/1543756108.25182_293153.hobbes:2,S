I'm afraid I cannot accept even the updated version of your patch.
Your second patch updates libata-core, and adds ULi-specific code to it.
What we need to do is
1) determine if your problem is ULi-specific, or applies to other
controllers
2a) If the problem is not ULi-specific, simply update libata to new
behavior.
2b) If the problem is ULi-specific, libata must be modified such that
all ULi-specific reset procedures are in sata_uli.c, and _no code is
duplicated from libata_.  This may require that we change the libata
API.  In Linux, it is OK to change the driver API when there is a problem :)
Regards,
	Jeff
