This introduces various AUDIT_ARCH numerical constants, which is a blatantly
stupid idea.  We already have a way to uniquely identify architectures, and
that's the ELF headers, no need for another parallel namespace.
(btw, could you please add to all patches who's responsible for them,
bk-audit.patch doesn't tell)
