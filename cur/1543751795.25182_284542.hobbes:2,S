And another.  I would also like to flag the exports themselves as
indicated in the patch below.  Thoughts?
						Thanx, Paul
What:	call_rcu(), call_rcu_bh(), and synchronize_kernel() change from
	EXPORT_SYMBOL() to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().
When:	January 9, 2006
Files:  kernel/rcupdate.c
Why:	There are no known environments supporting RCU from which
	one could reasonably expect to port a non-GPL kernel module
	or driver to Linux.
Who:	Paul E. McKenney <paulmck@us.ibm.com>
