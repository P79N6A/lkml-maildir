Subject: [PATCH] orinoco_plx-0.13b backport to kernel 2.2

I've backported David Gibson's orinoco_plx wireless driver to kernel 2.2.
The port is based on David Hinds's pcmcia-cs package. I've been running
various versions of this backport for over a year now and it has been
working well. I've updated it to the latest (testing, beta) version of
the orinoco_plx driver (0.13b) and the latest version of pcmcia-cs (3.2.3).
The patch comes in two parts. The first part updates the version of
orinoco, hermes, and orinoco_cs modules in pcmcia-cs-3.2.3 from 0.11b to
0.13b. The second part adds the backported orinoco_plx module. After
applying both patches, configure, build, and install pcmcia-cs as normal
and you should have an additional orinoco_plx.o module ready to use.
Patches are rather large so I've put them online here:
