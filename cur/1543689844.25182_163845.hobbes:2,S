Well, I didn't claim it'd be optimal, I just said that it's not worth the
extra effort.  The interactive task will still finish in O((interactive_time
/ timeslice) * #hogs + interative_time) ms.  As long as the cpu time
interactive tasks require are very short, they still should finish within a
reasonable amount of time.

That's assuming that the interactive task gets scheduled first.  In the
worst case scenario where it gets scheduled last, at 2 ms, it takes 12 ms
and at 1 ms it also takes 12 ms.  Not much difference there.
