Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Unionfs: avoid using drop_pagecache_sb in remount
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/14/179

Exporting drop_pagecache_sb to modules is somewhat risky because one cannot
sleep inside invalidate_mapping_pages.  This could cause a lot of latency in
the pre-emption code.  So don't export this symbol to minimize the risk that
others will use it.
Instead, unionfs will try to directly invalidate as many pages it can from
the unionfs_remount code.  Invalidating those inode pages is not strictly
required, but helpful in encouraging a revalidation of inodes sooner than
waiting for individual f/s ops to access the union.  Since a remount is
already an expensive but rare operation, this inode pages invalidation
shouldn't add too much overhead.
