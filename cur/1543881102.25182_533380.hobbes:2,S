For the print statement?  What ever it is minor.

If we can get away without an extra flag it would really be
preferable.
In the container case we have an interesting and very common
scenario struct user *our_user != &root_user. our_user->uid == 0.
I.e. The root in the what is the container but not the root
of the entire system.
So I want to minimize the changes needed to existing programs.
Now if all we have to do is specify MS_SETUSER when root a
user with CAP_SETUID is setting up a mount as a user other
then himself then I don't much care.  If we have to call MS_SETUSER
as unprivileged users I will have to modify mount binaries to work
differently inside and outside of containers.
Further there is only one or two versions of mount in widespread
use on linux, and unless you do something special fsuid == euid.
So the chance of fsuid set to some random value is pretty low.
So yes I think we can be 99.9% certain that existing callers of
mount(2) don't have fsuid set to some random value just by
inspecting the code of mount(1).

I don't think we should treat any mount special and all mounts
should be owned.

In the uid namespace the comparison is simpler as are the propagations
rules.  Basically if you use a struct user you will never need to
care about a uid namespace.  If you don't we will have to tear through
this code another time.
Plus like I was mentioning earlier.  If we do have a struct user there
implementing per user mount rlimits becomes trivial.
