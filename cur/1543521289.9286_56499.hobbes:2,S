I did a minor error in bdflush that caused it to be wakeup at regular
intervals. bdflush instead should sleep all the time unless there are too
many dirty buffers. It's only a performance issue. The below fix applyed
cleanly to 2.3.36:
--- 2.3.25pre3-i386/fs/buffer.c.~1~	Mon Nov  1 18:44:06 1999
+++ 2.3.25pre3-i386/fs/buffer.c	Mon Nov  1 18:56:58 1999
