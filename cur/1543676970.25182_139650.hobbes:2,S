Wrong. You misunderstand why this is done. We want to know for various
wackomtic old IDE devices and the key to knowing if its going to be
33Mhz is "does it have a PCI bus".
BTW if you want to be pedantic your "fix" is as broken as the original
since PCI root bridges can live on hotpluggable cards on a different
system bus 8)
