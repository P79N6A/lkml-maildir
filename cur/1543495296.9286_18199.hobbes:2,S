I would like to see the Linux dev's present during NT server set up, to
get confirmation that the NT they use is a fresh out of the box CD, and not
some ringer set up.
I mean sure, we could tweak the Linux kernel to do nothing but run these
benchmarks good too. But M$ is devious enough to try this and then claim it's a
from a stock source tree.
Keep your eyes peeled and be very wary.
