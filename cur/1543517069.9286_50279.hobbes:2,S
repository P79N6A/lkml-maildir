Strace 4.1 has been released!
The most important changes in this release since the 4.0 release
are added support for Linux/MIPS, updates to the network-code
and of course a number Linux syscalls added or improved.
Please read the global README and the README for your OS when you
compile strace!
For Linux there are now also a couple of kernel patches available at
the strace homepage that make strace usage a bit more pleasant.
If you have questions, remarks or patches you can send those to the
strace mailinglist. You can subscribe by sending an email with the subject
"subscribe" to strace-request@lists.wiggy.net.  You can post to the list by
sending mail to strace@lists.wiggy.net.
You can get strace at two locations:
 * homepage at

 * CVS archive at :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/strace,
