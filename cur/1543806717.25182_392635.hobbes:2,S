Actually, suspend2 has similar limitation. It still needs half a
memory free, but it does not count caches into that as it can save
them separately.
That means that on certain small systems (32MB RAM?), suspend2 is going to
have big advantage of responsivity after resume. But on the systems
where [u]swsusp can't suspend (6MB RAM?), suspend2 is not going to be
able to suspend, either. [Roughly; due to bugs and implementation
differences there may be some system size where one works and second
one does not, but they are pretty similar]
But that's probably not a problem as it is only going to fail on
*very* small system. Desktops with 6MB RAM are not too common these
days, fortunately. Not even in embedded space.
