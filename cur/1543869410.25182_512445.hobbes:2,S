Hi All!
For my work I am using a Huawei E620 HSDPA/UMTS card, and I would like
to use it under Linux :)
Before this I had a card with only UMTS/GPRS functions and as soon as
I inserted the card some /dev/ttyUSB nodes were created, with this
card this doesnt happen, eventho the different fora say it should.
On one of the fora I see that an external module exists for this card,
but when I try to compile it it tells me TTY_DONT_FLIP is not defined.
This sounds like something that should be (or used to be) defined by
tty_driver.h or tty_flip.h.
Does anyone have an idea of how to use this card or compile these
drivers needing the TTY_DONT_FLIP?
Thanks,
Patrick
