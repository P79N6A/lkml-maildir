That's odd because it wasn't that way in 2.4 and the beta 2.6 kernels.
I did see an error trying to load sr_mod when cdrecord runs, presumably
because it is trying to scan my external SCSI burner, which is turned
off.
But "modprobe sr_mod" works fine.
In case it matters, I have a VIA 82Cxxx chipset and an Asus K7V
motherboard, one of those KT133 Pro models.
