In another mail to Matthew, I suggested that the zone->free_area_usemap
could be used to track hotplug blocks of pages by either using a
bit-pattern of 11 for hotplug pages or adding a third bit.
get_pageblock_type() could then be taught to identify a hotplug region
within page_alloc.c at least. If the information is needed outside the
allocator, it will need more work though.

I can almost guarentee that will fail in low-memory conditions. Before I
implemented proper fallback logic, I used to get oopses in low-memory
conditions. I found it was because KernNoRclm had nowhere to fallback but
there was loads of free memory so kswapd was not taking place.
So, just disabling fallback is not the right answer.
