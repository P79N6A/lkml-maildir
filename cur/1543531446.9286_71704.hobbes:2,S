Hi,
 I found some messages in the syslog file (/var/log/messages) which
 are unknown to me. Cause I additionally have some strange "stops"
 while I am trying to download things from the net, I want to know
 whether this is related. The messages are of the pattern:
  Mar 23 16:37:56 solfire inetd[339]: smtp/tcp: bind: Address already in use
 What happens here?
 I am using glibc-2.1.3 and kernel 2.3.99-pre2
 Thank you very much in advance for any help!
 KEEP HACKING!
