The difference between 3 minutes and 2.45 isn't really a lot imho. What
is interesting if difference scales; that is, if you compile on a 486
or so, does the 10% drop still hold, or are we still talking about a
difference of 15 seconds. If the latter, I'd go for the cleanup,
but if the former is true, maybe, just maybe, the ugly version might
be the solution.
I'd prefer all includes that can be to be non-conditional, though.
