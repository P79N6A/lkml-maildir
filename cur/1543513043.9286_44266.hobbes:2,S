Also check your processor - I had this on one system with a Cyrix
486sx/33 CPU where it turned out that the CPU was claiming to have
some facility it didn't actually have, and that was tripping gcc up. I
never did find out precicely what facility was involved, but replacing
it with an AMD 486sx/33 CPU cured the problem, although replacing it
with another (four) Cyris 486sx CPU's didn't help...
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
