Subject: IDE RAID Hardware Advice
I'll be assembling a terabyte of IDE RAID network attached storage,
and was looking for some advice on:
  - best supported and most reliable multi-channel IDE controller;
  - best supported and most reliable NFS implementation;
  - any other random advise about things to do or not do in setting up
    this type of system.
