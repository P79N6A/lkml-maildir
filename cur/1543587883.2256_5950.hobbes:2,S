Subject: kernel threads and close method in a device driver

I'm involved with modifying a device driver for new hardware.
The architecture is currently:
	open device
	do IOCTL (spinning a kernel thread and doing initialization)
There is currently an IOCTL which short-circuits to the close method.
Turns out it seems necessary to do this IOCTL -- close never gets 
invoked.
What can cause a close not to get invoked?  BTW, the close is returning
with a 0 status to the application ...(it definitely did NOT 
get invoked in the driver)
In ps:
  F   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   VSZ  RSS WCHAN  STAT TTY        TIME COMMAND
040 33839   750     1   7   0  1064  348 end    D    pts/2      0:00 ./openinit
040 33839   630     1   0   0  1064  348 end    D    pts/0      0:00 ./openinit
These are the kernel threads which won't go away.
I'm running 2.2.12 with the bigphysarea patch...
(leave my work address on the distribution -- I get linux kernel at home...)
