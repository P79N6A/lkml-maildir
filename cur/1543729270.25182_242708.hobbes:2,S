Hi,
After upgrading to 2.6.8.1-mm1 from plain 2.6.8.1 my machine does not
boot anymore. The last message i see is:
ACPI: Processor [CPU0] (supports C1,C2,C3, 8 throttling states)
In plain 2.6.8.1 the next messages would be:
ACPI: Thermal Zone [THRM] (52 C)
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 175x65
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected SiS 648 chipset
Booting with acpi=off works fine. I have also tried pci=routeirq but it
does not make any difference.
The machine is an Asus L5c laptop.
