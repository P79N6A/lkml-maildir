OK, there is something holding up the client-side piece of NFS/RDMA. 
There is some hackery required for the NFS client to recognize that the 
RDMA transport should be used instead of the standard socket transport.
We did discuss this a bit at Connectathon '07 six weeks ago, but my 
impression is that more discussion is required.
I'm working on some changes to NFS mounting that would move NFS mount 
option parsing into the kernel.  This would make it very simple to add 
RDMA transport support, but it's rather a while in coming.
