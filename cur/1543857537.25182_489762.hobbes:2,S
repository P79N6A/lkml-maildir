In an lwn.net article, Jonathan Corbet made two very helpful comments
about the file capabilities patch currently being tested in -mm.  The
first is that capabilities are being honored on nosuid filesystems.
The other is that root can lose capabilities by executing files with
only some capabilities set.  The next two patches change these
behaviors.
thanks,
