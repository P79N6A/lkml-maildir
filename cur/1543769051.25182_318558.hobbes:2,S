Ouch, that's not good at all.  Care to take this info to the
linux-hotplug-devel mailing list and we can work on fixing this for you?
(first a few things to try, use 'udevsend' and build udev using klibc.
Also do not have any rules that call out to shell scripts, as you are
using devfs I don't see that you need any special rules at all
probably.)

It can be based on your patch :)
Anyway, it's floating around in the lkml archives, sorry, don't have a
direct link.

That's not the email address listed in MAINTAINERS, is it?

with klibc?  Again, take it to linux-hotplug-devel, if we don't get
reports about problems, we assume that everyone is happy with it.  I
haven't seen you asking about this there.

It's just a mirrage, it's not really that fast :)

Even with ash built with klibc and/or busybox?

lkml archives.  Or base it on your work you have already started to do
:)
