You must be using a funny kernel, or you have loop on a funny address_space.
The current ->prepare_write() API definition requires that the page be kmapped.
By ->prepare_write.  So it appears that the real bug is actually in whatever
you've mounted your loop on.
Now, Linus (I think) decided that this wasn't a good API and moves were made
to change it.  Note how generic_file_write() kmaps the page as well.  So
we're currently kmapping pages twice on such rare operations as writing
to an ext2 file ;)
So right now, it's unclear whether the kmap should be done by prepare/commit,
or whether it should be done by the caller.  I started to clean it up. Al
disagreed with Linus.  I went and did something else.
