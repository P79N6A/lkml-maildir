Subject: [patch 0/2] Sort module list for /proc/modules seq file reads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
Here is the updated version of the module list sort for coherent seq file reads.
It includes, in the comments, a byte-by-byte test case that shows the race it
solves. It has been updated since the last post to make sure the byte-by-byte
read works correctly by using "pos" instead of m->private as position indicator.
Only /proc/modules is provided as a user, but it should eventually be used by
other kernel parts, such as kallsyms, to make sure they protect themselves from
list modification while they iterate on them.
It applies to 2.6.23-rc3-mm1.
Mathieu
