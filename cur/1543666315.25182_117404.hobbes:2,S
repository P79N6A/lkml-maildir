Wouldn't this file be better in arch/i386/mach-summit in keeping with
all the other subarch stuff?
While you're creating a separate file for summit, could you move the
summit specific variables (mpparse.c:x86_summit is the only one, I
think) into it so we can clean all the summit references out of the main
line?
Thanks,
James
