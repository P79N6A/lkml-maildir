That suggests we'd want a pool size of 1 to be O(1) buzzword
compliant ;)
Going for a smaller pool just doesn't make sense if you want
the mappings to be cached, it could even result in more processes
_sleeping_ on kmap entries to be freed.
Please make a choice, do you want kmaps to be cached or would
you be content to have just cpu-local or maybe process-local
kmaps and get rid of the global kmap pool ?
regards,
Rik
