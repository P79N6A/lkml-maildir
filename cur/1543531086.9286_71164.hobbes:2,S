   There aren't any. No resource is infinite, so any resource allocation
can fail at any time, whether you're operating in kernel space or in user
space. If your favourite pice of code doesn't handle unavailability of
resources in a satisfactory way, you can try to fix it yourself, get
someone else (such as the maintainer) to fix it or just try to live with
it.
   As for the comparison with banks: Completely irrelevant. Banks aren't
expected to conform to ISO C and POSIX standards. Linux is.
