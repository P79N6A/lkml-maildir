Hi,
I've notices weird compile time failures etc on test12-pre7, especially
running more than 2 simultaneous processes...
but most noticeable is the time it takes to run ldconfig, after the
first time test11 takes less than 1 second, test12-pre7 takes ~40
seconds.
both were run immediately after reboot on a completely idle system
this system is almost exclusively NFS mounted file systems.
Is this a known problem?
Martin
