You shouldn't need to... look further in the Makefile:
# use '-fno-strict-aliasing', but only if the compiler can take it
CFLAGS += $(shell if $(CC) -fno-strict-aliasing -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null
>/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "-fno-strict-aliasing"; fi)
So that part is automagically corrected nowadays...  Now, the remaining 
question is what else is up wrt 2.94 and 2.2.x kernels ?  Mine have
(fingers crossed) been running for a while with no problems (yet)...
