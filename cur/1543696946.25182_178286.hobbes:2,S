Any reason why the current partition-mapping code couldn't be extended
to handle partition detection on a generic block device (which is what
MD presents I think) instead of a struct gendisk?  Then it wouldn't
matter which scheme someone wanted to use - any scheme provided for in
the kernel (or userspace if partx were extended) could be used.
I'm partial to the EFI format too, but wouldn't want to write that
code a second time, once for normal disks, and once for md.
Thanks,
Matt
