On the live filesystem?  There are no cache coherency guarantees for
fsck on mounted filesystems.
Other than that, there were a couple of races fixed in the final 2.2.14
kernel release concerning interactions between block device access and
filesystem access to the same device, so even a readonly "fsck -n" on a
mounted device could cause the filesystem to get confused in certain
cases.  Can you reproduce the problems on 2.2.14 kernels?
