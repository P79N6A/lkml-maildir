The problem is partly caused by the NFS server indefinitely caching NFS
request XIDs to responses, and the NFS client not having a way to generate
a random initial XID.  (thus, for each reboot, it starts at the same XID
number).
Upgrade your NFS server to kernel 2.2.18, and don't reboot more than once
in a 2 minute window.
