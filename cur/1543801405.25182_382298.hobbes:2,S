Is this safe to use in NUMA path as well? Not that memory hot-remove is there
yet today, but if a NUMA node is being removed, i would assume the memory for 
that node goes with it. i.e assuming alloc_percpu() gets node local memory for 
each cpu.
So is it safe to continue to reference an area of an offline cpu that may not
exist?
