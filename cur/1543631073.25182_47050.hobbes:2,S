Subject: [PATCH] arch/i386/kernel/irq.c: do_IRQ()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/5/20/187

Though a comment in arch/i386/kernel/irq.c: do_IRQ() clearly states:
         * 0 return value means that this irq is already being
         * handled by some other CPU. (or is disabled)
it seems that the function can only ever return (1). We wrote some low-level
interrupt handling code that depends on the correct value of this function.
Is the following patch what was initially desired? (patched against 2.4.18
tarball from kernel.org...)
Thanks,
William Jhun
