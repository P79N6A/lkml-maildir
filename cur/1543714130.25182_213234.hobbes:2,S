Thanks, very helpful!
Now, I`m trying to be compatible with older kernels (2.2 - 2.4) and want to 
find out what kernel version ist installed, from Makefile. My first solution:
# Makefile
KERNELVERSION := $(shell uname -r)
KERNELBASE    := $(basename $(KERNELVERSION))
KERNELMINOR   := $(suffix $(KERNELBASE))
KERNELMAJOR   := $(basename $(KERNELBASE))
OLD_MODULES := $(strip $(foreach V, .0 .1 .2 .3 .4, $(shell [ "$(V)" = 
"$(KERNELMINOR)" ] && echo yes)))
ifeq ($(KERNELMAJOR),2)
ifeq ($(OLD_MODULES),yes)
#	old style make
endif #ifeq ($(OLD_MODULES),yes)
#	new style make, like pointed out in LWN
else #ifeq ($(KERNELMAJOR),2)
all:
	@echo kernel $(KERNELVERSION) not supported
endif #ifeq ($(KERNELMAJOR),2)
Any improvements? Up to which kernel version should old style make be used?

Axel Weiss
