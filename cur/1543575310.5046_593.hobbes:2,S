Hmm... I've looked through the ll_rw_block() callers and yes, it seems
to be doable. BTW, we probably want a helper function that would do
lock+ll_rw_block+wait - it will simplify the life in filesystems.
I'll do a patch tonight.

PS: alpha-testers needed for sysvfs patches - right now the thing is racey
as hell and unlike minixfs I can't test it myself. It's more or less
straightforward port of minixfs patch that went into the tree sometime
ago, so it shouldn't be too bad, but... IOW, if somebody has boxen to
test the thing on - yell.
