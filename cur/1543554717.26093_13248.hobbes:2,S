That's completely the wrong way to look at it.  AMD are certainly free
to add features, what they aren't free to do is making code that
expects the documented behaviour fail -- and if so, it's their bug.  I
have so far gotten no indication that that is the case; the only thing
I have gotten so far is a positive report that it at least doesn't do
the wrong thing in the no-#MF case.
