Just a general note about swap preallocation:  I've done truckloads of
experimentation over the last year or so, and it is generally true that
kernels which have an active swapcache prior to need perform much better
than those which don't at crunch time.
It's also generally true that kernels which actually page very lightly
before crunchtime react sooner/better to crunch.  I hate to see swap
totally untouched because I then know full well that I have a bunch
of totally inactive but plugged up ram pages.  (If you have too much
ram, that doesn't matter :)
