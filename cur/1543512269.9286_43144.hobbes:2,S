Hi all,
    Since long fsck times on my Linux samba/NFS file servers have become an
annoyance, albiet a minor one thanks to Linux's stability (but nothing can
stop a client from turning the server off and crashing the server or similar
mishaps and a few times Linux failed to unmount some filesystem(s) when
doing a reboot or started booting and said some maximum mount count had been
reached and started fscking), I decided to look into FreeBSD when I heard
that it had a journaling filesystem with the additional plus of large file
support.  However this also has me wondering why FFS support hasn't been
included in the Linux kernel.  I would have thought that with the need for a
journaling filesystem FFS would have been adopted, especially with the BSD
code available.  Is there some issue that has prevented this?
