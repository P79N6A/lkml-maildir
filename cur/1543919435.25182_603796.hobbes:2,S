This is a very subtle error.  You're building without hotplug, which
causes __devexit to become __exit, so scsi_esp_unregister is placed in
the discard section of vmlinux.  Unfortunately, the EXPORT_SYMBOL causes
it to be referenced from the symbol export table.
The fix is probably just to remove the __devexit tag from the function
rather than trying to work out how to make the export symbol conditional
on the symbol not being discarded.
