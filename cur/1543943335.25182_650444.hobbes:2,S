Network is shutdown just before kexec -e finally enters the kernel and 
starts preparing to jump to the new kernel. Any syncing operation, or
File system unmounting operation will be done before that.
Can't understand why not disabling the network will help in NFS umount
or syncing operation. It has to be something else.
