Odd, it works for me here.
Hm, but that's not at boot time, I load the module at udev init time.
Miles, are you using this as a module or built into the kernel?
Hm, I'm also running it on a single proc machine, which really does not

Anyone have a dual-core laptop they want to donate to the effort?  :)
