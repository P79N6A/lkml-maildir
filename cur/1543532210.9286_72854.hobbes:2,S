Maybe I am mixing up oranges and logs, but for me, in certain cases,
a log-based filesystem can be way faster than a normal or
metadata-log filesystem: as data is only appended, you can do
the append sequentially and in very big chunks (say, 4 MBytes
sequential I/Os). You will get very good performance from
single device and hardware (or even software) RAID0. And
you don't need to think about seek times when writing.
Of course, in theory this also means you have to add a new disk
drive every now and then, unless some data reclaimation is
done. Which brings in new problems.
This can of log file system (with data reclaimation) ressembles
a bit the HSM system when using tapes for data migration.
