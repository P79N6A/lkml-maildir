I could do that, but...

..I dont know if this is really a problem. i386 is the only architecture where 
I was able to reproduce the inline problem. But i386 does not set 
SYSCALL_WRAPPERS so the problem goes away.
I suggest to wait for a patch until we know of an architecture that is 
affected (inline problem + HAVE_SYSCALL_WRAPPERS set).
