Yes, I do understand, and no, I did not try to get on that
nerve =)
The thing is just that you guys cannot decide if left, or
right is the best path to take, and that do create some
confusion, especially when you want to do the proper fix,
and a few things are falling apart around you =)
And patching it the wrong way, and then hitting one of your
possible quirks, will make things even worse, as if nobody
can remember about this, then it might be a very hard job
to track it, as you will be the only ones with this issue.
Some upstream userland authors have already done come up
with the following 'fix', which you may or may not approve
of:
--
#undef __STRICT_ANSI__
#include <linux/cdrom.h>
#define __STRICT_ANSI__
--
I guess the easier option might just be to drop -ansi :/
Thanks,
