M:N threads are supposed to have other advantages beside fast context
switches. Original paper on scheduler activations mentioned case when
kernel thread is preempted while user level thread it runs held spin
lock. When kernel notifies user level scheduler about preemption
(through upcall) it can de-schedule all user level threads spinning on
this lock, so that they will not waste their time slices burning CPU.
