That was a horrible paragraph plus I'm bored at the moment. What I meant is
that lockless algorithms occasionally have a spin-try associated with it as
well that might possibly validate the data that's updated against the entire
data structure for some kind of consistency cohernecy or possibly on an
individual element. That retry or spin can be considered a contention as well
and it can be made aware to this lock-stat patch just by connecting the
actually occurance of retry logic against a backing object.
I need to be more conscious about proofreading what I write before sending
it off. Was this clear ?
