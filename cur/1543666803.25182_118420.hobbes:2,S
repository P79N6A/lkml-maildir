When does it die? At initial boot or at resume?
I don't claim that every driver that's hooked into the driver
model actually handles suspend/resume correctly, but this patch
does migrate APM/apic.c/nmi.c from the old PM system to the
driver model. I've tested it on plain P3 & P4 desktop machines.
Try a minimal .config.
