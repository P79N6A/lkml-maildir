Yes and no. It should indeed be monotonic for normal uses. There is a specific
SMP problem right now that Ingo had some patches for (if you have a CPU setup
where the TSC's are not in sync which a few boards do). 
However on a system data change by root or when xntpd jumps the clock because
its too far out it won't be monotonic. So yes Linux is broken somewhere but
xclock has a minor silly buglet too
