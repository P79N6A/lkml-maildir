Yes, possibly.  Also the unlocked pages which have locked buffers,
which tends to be 99% of the pages...
But then again:
- I've never seen this code disgrace itself in profiler output unless
  it's in already-hopelessly-confused mode.
- Personally, I wouldn't recommend anything like that without having
  previously done a deep analysis of the existing implementation's
  dynamics and behaviour.  Something which would take a week (or two,
  given the way the elevator analysis is shaping up).
  This activity is something which I have never countenanced because
  the code has been under continual futzing for a year.
