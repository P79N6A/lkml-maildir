Um, I don't know what this does, sorry.
I have no idea how Fedora chooses what to put in an initrd; I can't think
of a sensible way of deciding what goes in and what doesn't other than
lists and heuristics.
But there really is no explicit dependency between virtio modules and
virtio_pci.  There just is for kvm/x86 at the moment, since that is how
they use virtio.  Running over another bus is certainly possible,
though may never happen for x86 (happens today for s390).
Cheers,
Rusty.
