I just sent the Orlov allocator patch to Linus.  It will double or
triple ext2 performance in that test, so please make sure you compare
against the latest.  There's a copy at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.45/shpte-stuff/broken-out/orlov-allocator.patch
We can expect similar gains for ext3, when that's done.
(The 2x-3x is on an 8meg filesystem.  Larger filesystems should
gain more)
