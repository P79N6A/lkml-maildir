If I was clued enough to know KNI, I could say for a certainty.  I am
assuming it's a form of MMX or related.  My notebook is a mobile pII 366.
I'm stress testing it now with ac12.  I originally had pre9 on it.  There is
one difference other than that, I have Marcelo's bg aging patch on here which
seems to have improved responsiveness significantly but I'll save that for
another story.
I've triggered it, report follows in next email.
