Subject: [PATCH] sbp2: make 1bit bitfield unsigned
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/15/251

A signed single-bit bitfield doesn't make much sense. Make it unsigned.
