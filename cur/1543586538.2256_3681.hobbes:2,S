The above is a generic message that simply is stating that NFS traffic
is congested because the server isn't responding for whatever reason.
In 99% of all cases, this means that the server is not seeing all the
packets that the client is sending it. This forces the client to
throttle back the number of requests it can have on the fly, and then
to wait until the given packet times out, and then to resend.
Try checking whether or not the server is seeing all the packets that
the client is sending by comparing the output of tcpdump/ethereal
between the client and the server.
If the packet loss is large, try fiddling with the hardware: typically
stuff such as overriding the NIC autoconfiguration, swapping the NIC,
checking for noisy cables,...
If you're unable to trace the problem, try playing around with
rsize/wsize, timeo and retrans (man 5 nfs). The smaller the packet,
the less the chances are of UDP fragments getting lost.
You might also want to try out the NFS ping patch from
