I don't believe that is true in the slightest.  You can iterate over the 
variable MTRRs and see if any part of them overlaps the target range; 
doing exhaustive enumeration is clearly bogus, especially on 64-bit 
platforms.

So what you're saying here is "it's bogus, but it doesn't really matter 
anyway?"  Why bother having it at all, then?
Seriously, if it's not unconditionally correct, then:
a. it should be *clearly* labelled a heuristic.
b. it should be *clearly* explained why having the heuristic is much 
better than not having anything.
In this case, neither of those conditions appear to be addressed.
