I already have running kernels compiled with gcc-2.92.2 and 2.7.2.3
but this is far from the end of the story. I am looking for the source
of large user level program which massively uses string procedures in
order to stress the register allocator of the compiler - may be XFree86
is a good choice.

I'll need the comments from many people around.
