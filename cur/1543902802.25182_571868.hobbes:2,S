I agree the current code flushes the I-cache for all kinds of file
systems (for PTEs with the exec bit on).
The error is that it does it after the PTE is written.
In addition, I wanted to optimize it to gain a few %.
Apparently this idea is not much welcome.
I can agree that flushing the I-cache (if the architecture requires it)
before setting the PTE eliminates the error.
Thanks,
Zoltan
