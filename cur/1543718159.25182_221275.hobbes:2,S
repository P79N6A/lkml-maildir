Well in that case perhaps something else broke.  I've seen no such reports
of recent regressions in the ramdisk driver.
The two problems of which I am aware are:
a) It loses its brains across umount.  Seems that it's very rare that
   anyone actually cares about this, which is why it has not been fixed in
   well over a year.
b) It loses data under heavy I/O loads.  I _think_ this has been
   observed only on ppc64 and might be a cache writeback/invalidate thing.
If there are new post-2.6.5 problems then I'm all ears.
