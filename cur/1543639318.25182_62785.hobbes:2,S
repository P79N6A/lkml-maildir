Is there a way to map entries in /proc/scsi/scsi with
their corresponding mapping with /dev/sda, /dev/sdb
etc ?
During system boot, entries in /proce/scsi/scsi and
/dev are initialized in serial order, and there is a
one to one mapping. However, this mapping is NOT
guaranteed if devices are selectively removed and
added using "scsi remove-single-device" and "scsi
add-single-device" commands.
Any idea of how to work around it ?
TIA.
Tom
