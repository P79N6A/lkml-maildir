.o files???
It probably goes without saying, that gitfs should have some basic 
configuration file to setup its transparent behaviour, and which would most 
probably contain an include / exclude file-filter mask, and probably other 
basic configuration options.  But this is really secondary to the 
implementation, and the question remains whether git is efficient enough.
IOW, how big is the git commit overhead as compared to a normal copy?
Thanks!
