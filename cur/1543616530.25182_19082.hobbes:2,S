One question - what happens to the emails after they are delivered?  Are
they kept on the local filesystem?  That would be one reason why you have
so many inodes and dentries in the cache - they are cacheing all of these
newly-accessed inodes in the assumption that they may be used again soon.
Even on my system, I have about 35000 items in the inode and dentry caches.

Well, Linux will pretty much always use up all of your memory.  The real
question always boils down to how to use it most effectively.
Without patch:

Well with the patch, you have:
((11350 - 7805) + (8002 - 4180) + (1858 - 885)) * 4096 bytes = 32MB
more RAM to play with.  Granted that it is not a ton on a 1GB machine,
but it is nothing to sneeze at either.  In your case, we could still
be a lot more aggressive in removing dentries and inodes from the cache,
but under many workloads (not the artificial use-once case of such a
benchmark) that may be a net performance loss.
One interesting tidbit is the number of size-32 items in use.  This means
that the filename does not fit into the 16 bytes provided inline with
the dentry.  There was another patch available which increased the size
of DNAME_INLINE_LEN so that it filled the rest of the cacheline, since
the dentries are aligned this way anyways.  Depending on how much space
that gives you, and the length of the filenames used by qmail, you could
save another (whopping) 3.5MB of space and avoid extra allocations for
each and every file.
Still, these slabs only total 18744 pages = 73 MB, so there must be
another culprit hiding elsewhere using the other 720MB of RAM.  What
does the output of Ctrl-Alt-SysRQ-M show you (either kernel is fine).
Cheers, Andreas
