I can tell you what went wrong:
This cmd=1 is SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND, but that doesn't seem to be
what's intended ... I'm guessing it's a legacy ide ioctl value which
suddenly has become interpreted as a scsi_ioctl ... and certainly a non
CD IDE device cannot handle a SCSI command, so all hell breaks loose.
I suspect all we really want from this addition is to be able to get
SG_IO on the ide device, in which case this should be the fix (I put a
case statement instead of an if so we can add other ioctl values to it
in case I missed any).
