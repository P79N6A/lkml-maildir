  Yes, that is how those manufacturers that have paid royalties to Hayes
are doing it. (Or perhaps the issue is just sloppynes of emulation; anyway,
Hayes has a patent at that breakage sequence along with idle "safety"
periods both sides of it.)
Like has been mentioned here recently (last week, I recall), if you have
this problem, turn off the local modem escape by issuing  AT S2=255
command before doing dialing; or dial by:
	ATS2=255DTnnnnnnnnnnn
that is, prefix the dial command (DTnnnn) with escape disable command.
Check your modem manual for the S-register number, and disabling value.
Document I used said 'escape is turned off with any value above 127'.
If the problem is at your ISP's side, then you need to inform them.
