Point one: The interface didn't do this UNTIL you changed the code
Point two: Just because no one has reported other filesystem
breakage, it doesn't mean other filesystems have not broken.
Perhaps I should have the check in my code.  However, it is
still stupid to fix an occasional race by ensuring readpage() is
always called with an out of bounds index when files are 0 or a
4K multiple.  The filesystem check may prevent a crash, but it
is needlessly wasteful by design, not through any inadvertant
race condition.
