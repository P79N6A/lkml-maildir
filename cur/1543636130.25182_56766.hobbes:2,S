How would it? At some layer, the two are merged anyway (for example, at least
on disk you'll have blocks again). Doing it up high means more unified code
below.

That is not true. Late IDE also has this, and systems like drbd - which
currently uses a quite clever heuristic to deduce barriers - could also
utilize this input.
