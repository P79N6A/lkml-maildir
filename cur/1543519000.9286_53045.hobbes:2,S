Subject: 2.2.14pre10 bug?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When I came to work this morning, I saw this on my console:
VM: killing process syslogd
VM: killing process communicator-sm
VM: killing process enlightenment
VM: killing process soffice.bin
VM: killing process panel
VM: killing process XF86_SVGA
Load average was 1.07, so I checked "top" and saw this:
  149 root      13   0   132    6    16 R       0 99.4  0.0  2710m klogd
Is this normal?-) I don't like my apps being killed during a weekend ;)
System was still fully usable, but I desided to reboot.
Linux mansion 2.2.14pre10 #1 Fri Dec 3 11:34:29 EET 1999 i686 unknown
gcc version 2.7.2.3
glibc 2.1.2
Debian GNU/Linux potato
The system is PIII/450 with 128MB of ram and 15GB IBM IDE disk.
Machine works and has worked fine, no crashes or anything like that.
Kernel configuration is included as a attachment.
