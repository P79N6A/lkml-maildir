Whooooowww...  Power4 I believe opted out at 16MB.
So the story about sleeping beauty is true :-).
Wouldn't want to manage the 8-32 physical pages of memory through the VM.
Paging not an option, file access irrelevant.
In that case I agree that it should be handled by a special purpose
extension like Seth's patch to cover a 4GB page. 
Upto 4MB or so I still believe going the other way is proper.
More later... thanks for the info.
