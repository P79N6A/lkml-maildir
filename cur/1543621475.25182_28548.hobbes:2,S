I don't use USB, and I have had several machines lock up hard while doing
medium to heavy IO.  I've had this happen with pre9-mjc2 and another patch
that just contained pre9-preempt-schedo1
(nyu.dyn.dhs.org:8080/patches/2.4.18-pre9-to-rmap12e-schedO1-rml.patch.bz2)
I'm running 2.4.18-pre9-ac3 now to see if I can reproduce without prempt and
O(1).
I have someone else from IRC that has the same issue with prempt+O(1)
against vanilla 2.4.17.  He should be sending you a bug report soon.
BTW, all machines ran the same kernel compiled for SMP, but some machines
were UP.
Has anyone else seen this?
Mike
