Hi,
I have a quick question about the behavior of epoll. My usage scenario is 
as follows:
I add multiple fd's to the epoll set. Some of the fd's will have a lot of 
data coming in, while others will have noticeably less.
I start to epoll for events, only letting it return one event at a time
In this case, will the lesser-active fd's be starved out by the 
constantly-active fd's, or will they still be reliably seen?
