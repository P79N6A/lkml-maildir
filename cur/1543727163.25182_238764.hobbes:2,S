The 896M/128M split has a bit of a problem now each zone has its own LRU:
the size of the highmem zone is less than the amount of memory which is
described by the default /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio.  So it is easy to
completely fill highmem with dirty pages.  This causes a fairly large
amount of writeback via vmscan.c's writepage().  This causes poor I/O
submission patterns.  This causes a simple large, linear `dd' write to run
at only 50-70% of disk bandwidth.  (This was 6-12 months ago - it might be
a bit better now)
But I seem to be the only person who has noticed this yet ;) A workaround
is to decrease dirty_ratio and dirty_background_ratio.
Decreasing PAGE_OFFSET as above is attractive, but I believe 0xc0000000 is
part of the ABI, and although we know (from the 4g/4g and other such
patches) that everything will work OK, I wonder if it's really worth doing,
especially as it's a compile-time thing.
But hey, if someone can identify specific benefits from it then perhaps
sneaking in a config option, or maintaining an external patch would be
worthwhile.
