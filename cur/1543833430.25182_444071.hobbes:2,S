Even simpler would be to just make MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET be (LONG_MAX >> 1) 
and use this for both.  In fact, it appears it used to be, judging by 
the comment in jiffies.h:
 * The maximum jiffie value is (MAX_INT >> 1).  Here we translate that
But seeing as this could have unanticipated side effects, I like this 
fix better.
