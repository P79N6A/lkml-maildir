Mel Gorman's thesis. He is/was at Univerisity of Limerick, Ireland. URL
does not always seem to work - sometimes it goes down and comes up a bit
later. Has happened twice to me.
"
The documentation comes in two parts. The first is "Understanding the
Linux Virtual Memory Manager" and it does pretty much as described. It
is available in three formats, PDF, HTML and plain text.
Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager
PDF: 
http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/vm/guide/pdf/understand.pdf
HTML: 
http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/vm/guide/html/understand/
Text: 
http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/vm/guide/text/understand.txt
The second part is a code commentary which is literally a guided tour
through the code. It is intended to help decipher the more cryptic
sections as well as identify the code patterns that are prevalent
through the code. I decided to have the code separate from the first
document as maintaining the code in the document would be too painful
Code Commentary on the Linux Virtual Memory Manager
PDF:

Any feedback, comments or suggestions are welcome from anyone with a VM
interest but I would appreciate if people already familiar with the VM
would even give a brief read to check for technical accuracy. There was
rarely an authoritative source to check to make sure I was right and I
didn't want to be asking questions every 5 minutes on IRC or mailing
lists :-)
