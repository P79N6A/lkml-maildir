Now I'm confused.  If I understand the code, what I want is for the  
"io_32bit" setting to have its RW field set to SETTING_READ, such  
that drive->no_io_32bit can NOT be changed.  Additionally, I want it  
set to 1 if hwif->no_io_32bit is 1.
Are you saying that at the end of probe_hwif() I should iterate over  
the drives for that hwif and set drive->no_io_32bit to 1 if hwif- 
 >no_io_32bit is 1?  If so, can I do this in the last loop that  
already exists that iterates over the drives?
Will I not also want to test hwif->no_io_32bit in idedisk_setup() to  
ensure that it can only set driver->no_io_32bit to 0 if hwif- 
 >no_io32bit is 0?
