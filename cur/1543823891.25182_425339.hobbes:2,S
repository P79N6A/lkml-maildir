I wonder if firefox window gets redrawn when you scroll or move stuff over
it. I fondly remember GTK1 overdrawing the scrollbar with grey rectangles,
then putting the scrollbar pixmaps on top, repeated about 6 times, and this
all done a few times per second for a nice flickering effect on your scollbar..
Do the widget toolkits still only push pixels to the screen, or do they actually
take advantage of any acceleration features that X provides?
