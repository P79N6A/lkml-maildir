  Umm... I'm not sure I understand your objections - as I'm looking into the patch
all the copy_from_user() were moved from functions into sys_quotactl(). The
only thing you might not like is that XFS has extra structures and calls...
I don't like this too much either but XFS has different quota model so
creating common interface (structures) is a problem.

PS: Alan is not going to accept the patch anyway because he doesn't want further
  interface differences between his and Linus's tree. But anyway discussion on this
  topic is useful because I have similar patch for 2.5...
