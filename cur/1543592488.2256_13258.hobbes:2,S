is this fault tolerance?  I think if a CPU croaks, you are dead.
There are patches for hot swap cpu support, but I haven't seen any CPU
fault tolerance patches that can handle a dead processor

RAM fault tolerance?  There was a patch a long time ago which detected
bad ram, and would mark those memory clusters as unuseable at boot. 
However that is clearly not dynamic.
If your memory croaks, your kernel will experience random corruptions

no

LOBOS will let one Linux kernel boot another, but that requires a boot
step, so it is not a live upgrade.  so, no, afaik
