IIRC, Gentoo ignores some kinds of security bugs so that the task
remains manageable.  Debian, in contrast, hasn't released a kernel
update for its stable distribution since June (but unstable and even
testing is in surprisingly good shape).
Maybe the real vendor kernels are better.  Without CVE-based bug
tracking on their part, it is hard to tell, though. 8-)
