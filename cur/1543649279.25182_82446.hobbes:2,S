Official cryptoapi? Define official.

kerneli.org/cryptoapi _is_ useless joke for many needs. Fortunately other
people are able to see the limitations/sillyness of kerneli.org/cryptoapi:
1)  You are trying to replace link/insmod time overhead with runtime
    overhead + unnecessary bloat.
2)  No direct link access to low level cipher functions or higher level
    functions.
3)  No clean way to replace cipher code with processor type optimized
    assembler implementations.
