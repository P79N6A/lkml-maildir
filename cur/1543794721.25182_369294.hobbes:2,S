Unlike local filesystems, we don't want to have to take the i_sem in any
of the direct IO paths. The latter is just a liability as far as
applications are concerned: it doesn't offer any protection for local
data (there _is_ no local data to protect), but gets seriously in the
way of write parallelism.
The only difference I can see between the two paths is the call to
unmap_mapping_range(). What effect would that have?
