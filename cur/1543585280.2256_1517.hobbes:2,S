Yes, as SysRq quite possibly doesn't work on (since none of the keys on it
send the right keycode.)

The old one. :)

Er, I thought you just said you did?  What keycodes are you using?  Most
"Newworld" only have the F13-less keyboard.  Which sort of raises the question
of how 'Keypad +' worked instead of the "ALT" key (either option/alt or the
scroll key, whichever changes VC).  Which sounds more like a fluke then
anything else.  Which keyboard worked with 'Keypad +' ?  The ADB one?
After some quick playing with my oldworld machine, Just F13 - <command key>
is sufficient.  I'm not sure about PReP tho (so it's probably not worth
saying you don't need "ALT").
