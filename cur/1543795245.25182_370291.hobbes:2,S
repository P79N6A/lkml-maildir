Subject: [patch 00/22] PCI, USB and hwmon patches for 2.6.15-rc2-git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Here are a few PCI, USB, hwmon, and documentation patches against your
latest git tree, they have all been in the past few -mm releases just
fine.
The big changes in here are some ehci and ohci fixes to handle suspend
better (there is still one more pending patch to get it all working
completely, but that needs more testing before I send it to you.)
thanks,
greg k-h
