Hi all,
I noticed in the ALSA tree:
------------------------------ sound/sparc/dbri.c ------------------------------
index 12d11fc..e96023f 100644
@@ -66,6 +66,7 @@
 #include <sound/control.h>
 #include <sound/initval.h>
 
+#include <asm/prom.h>
 #include <asm/sbus.h>
 #include <asm/atomic.h>
(I don't mean to pick on this particular example, it is just what was in
front of me.)
Could people please consider using linux/{of,of_device,of_platform}.h
instead of asm/prom.h now that these exist.  Using asm/prom.h only works
now because it includes the above files, but that may (will?) change
eventually.
Most includes of asm/prom.h are there to get access to the routines and
data structures associated with the Open Firmware device tree, and these
are now all available from the above files instead.
