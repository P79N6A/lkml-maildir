The causes seem be the bad interaction of devfs, floppy, mount and
devfsd.
After further investigations:
- Oops happens in 2.4.9, 10pre4 and 10pre5.
- devfs=nomount solve the bug
- the oops happens in mount (I should investigate also why mount load
the
    floppy module at boot time)
- removing floppy modules or comment the line in fstab solve the bug.
   (manually loading the floppy module works without oops)
The strange things:
the bugs appear only after few day of rebooting 2.4.9 and yet
is disappeard.
The possible change in environtment is the update (and then downgrade)
of devfsd (last version, only with with/without an extra patch, in
debian).
But updating and downgading seem not to cause oops at the next boot.
(I should still better invetigate about this. Maybe the bug is
due to dev-state, thus the bug appear only after the 2 reboot?
)
In any case, I will invetigate more this night. Do you have some
suggestions about tests to do?

Ok, I'm waiting also for these changes!
