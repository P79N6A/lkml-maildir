I would suggest to drop the tsc.c change. The "small errors" can be
really large on some systems and you can also see large backward jumps.
I have a proper (but complicated) solution pending
in 
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/sched-clock-share
BTW with all this CPU time measurement it would be really nice to
report it to the user too. It seems a bit bizarre that the scheduler
keeps track of ns, but top only knows jiffies with large sampling errors.
