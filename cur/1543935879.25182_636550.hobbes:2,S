You are right.  I wonder if this, again, is a case of myself or
Lee forward porting old code.  I remember having (had) a very
different version of get_scan_ratio() at some point in the past,
but I cannot remember if we discarded this version for that other
version, or the other way around :(
Lee, would you by any chance still have some alternative versions
of get_scan_ratio() around?  I'm searching through my systems, but
have not found it yet...
