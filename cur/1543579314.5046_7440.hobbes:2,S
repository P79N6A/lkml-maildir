Subject: How come top and /proc/meminfo on 2.4.0 says 0K shared?

is this a bug?
We have a number of machines running 2.4.0 and /proc/meminfo says we're
sharing no memory.  top says that also, probably because it just reads
/proc/meminfo, or at least I assume that's how it works.    All the
individual procs show the memory they are sharing though.
thanks,
Ian
Here is /proc/meminfo:
