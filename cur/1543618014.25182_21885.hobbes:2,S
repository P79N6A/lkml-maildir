Yes, it's possible but it's of secondary importance.  The first, essential
goal has to be to eliminate the rmap fork overhead so that rmap becomes
a 'never worse and often better' solution.  It's for this reason that I
developed an algorithm a few weeks ago to do lazy page table instantiation
efficiently, which is what Rik is referring to.  I'm not quite ready to
post details yet, since I haven't tried it, and frankly, I'm learning about
Unix memory management as I go, so there may well be a gaping hole I've
missed.  Hopefully we'll know in a few days, and I'll post the full
writeup.
The way I see it, the purpose of lazy page table instantiation is to
overcome objections to the reverse pte mapping vm technique that have
been expressed in the past, namely the slowdown in dup_mmap inside fork.
I.e., if rmap slows down fork then Linus and Davem are going to
veto it, as they've done in the past, because they feel that the
as-yet-unproven advantages of physically-based vm scanning doesn't
outweigh the easily measurable fork overhead.  Personally, I think
that's debatable, but by eliminating the overhead we eliminate the
objection, and as far as I know, it's the only serious objection.
