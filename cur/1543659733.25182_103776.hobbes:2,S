   To call the netdev notifier chain I had to make netdev_chain not be
   static.  I added the declaration to <linux/netdevice.h> but I am open
   to other ways to give rtnetlink.c access to netdev_chain.
Ummm, what is the problem with using register_netdevice_notifier()?
It is precisely there so that netdev_chain need not be exported.
