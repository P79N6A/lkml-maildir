Hi,
what is the preferred way to get at another process's environment 
variables? /proc/$$/environ looks like the most portable way [across all 
arches Linux runs on], but it cannot easily be mmap'ed because the size 
is not known. In fact, mmap does not seem to work at all on that file. 
So I would have to allocate a large buffer (4K is the limit for procfs 
files AFAICR) to potentially hold big environments, which does not sound 
really wise either. Or is it the best choice available?
	-`J'
