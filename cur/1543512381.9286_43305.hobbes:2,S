on some of my machines i have over a dozen non-simplified routes that are built
from a variety of signals.  those signals don't necessarily exist again until
some time in the future.  in this case, it is silly to continuously save a state
table of the routes so when a NIC swap occurs i have correct information.  ip
link set up/down only brings up a route specific to the scope of the interface,
none other.
the concept of having a daemon add routes a split second after routes are deleted
by the kernel is rather silly.  just leave the routes there and mark them dead.
it's less work for the kernel and less work for userland.

yes really, all the routing depends on interfaces dependant upon those
interfaces.  and for the second sentence, routes marked dead are not usable.
routing stops over that route but the state information remains so you only need
mark it active again.

no, ip link set up/down rm/insmod can be human admin tasks and can well be
automated tasks.  hmm, i do suggest you delve into the current NET4
functionality.  there's a ton more to it than the simplistic "ifconfig" and
"route" i think you're currently familiar with.  :)
