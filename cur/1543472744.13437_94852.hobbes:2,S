Subject: Alpha Compilation fix for prepatch 2.1.132-4

Hi,
	It appears as if all of my performance counter patch didn't make
it into prepatch-2.1.132-4.  (Consequently, perf_irq is undefined, and this 
stops compilation)
The following patch does two things:
1)  Defines the perf_irq function in irq.h.  (This is need by alpha_ksyms.c)
2)  Adds a definition for the wrperfmon palcall.  Although, currently, the
    soon-to-be release Iprobe suite is the only thing that uses this, other
    tools in the future may also want it.  By keeping this in the kernel, they
    will not have to rewrite code. 
(Patch Below) 
Cheers,
