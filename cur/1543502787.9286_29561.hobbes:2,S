   I'm running a program that accesses the keyboard about ever 50000us
(sometimes every 25000us), and I frequently get keyboard timeouts, and
sometimes timeouts of other devices (such as sound).. I was wondering if
anyone knows of some sort of voodoo I can do to get around this, apart
from not running the program anymore ;)
