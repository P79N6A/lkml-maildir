You mean 2.6? That's what I'm saying also for a while. It's a known issue
and people are complaining about it because kernel breaks things (e.g.
they can't boot anymore and think Linux thrashed their systems).
I don't know who is the kernel maintainer today but apparently nobody.  
Old maintainer, Andries Brouwer, only repeates that the geometry doesn't
exists even if he was/is proved and pointed out to be wrong many times.
The issue was discussed long, several times on linux-kernel without a
satisfying solution.
