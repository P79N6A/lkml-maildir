Before merging all that I would definitely recommend some generic
module to allocate performance counters. IBM had a patch for this
long ago, and it is even more needed now.

Can't you share most/all of that file with i386 ? 
You'll want that definitely once you support Intel CPUs too, 
and you have to do that eventually.
Same for include/asm-x86_64/perfctr.h
+struct per_cpu_cache {	/* roughly a subset of perfctr_cpu_state */
+	union {
+		unsigned int id;	/* cache owner id */
+	} k1;
+	struct {
+		/* NOTE: these caches have physical indices, not virtual */
+		unsigned int evntsel[4];
+	} control;
+} ____cacheline_aligned;
+static struct per_cpu_cache per_cpu_cache[NR_CPUS] __cacheline_aligned;
This should use per_cpu_data
+static unsigned int new_id(void)
[...]
Why can't that wrap? Maybe it should use the functions in lib/idr.c ?
+	if( perfctr_cstatus_has_tsc(cstatus) )
+		rdtscl(ctrs->tsc);
+	nrctrs = perfctr_cstatus_nractrs(cstatus);
+	for(i = 0; i < nrctrs; ++i) {
+		unsigned int pmc = state->pmc[i].map;
+		rdpmc_low(pmc, ctrs->pmc[i]);
+	}
K8 has speculative rdtsc. Most likely you want a sync_core() somewhere
in there.
The way you set your brackets is weird.
Why do you check for K8 C stepping? I don't see any code that
does anything special with that.
