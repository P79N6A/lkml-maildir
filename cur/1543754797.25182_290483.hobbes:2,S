Wrong concept. Your exploit program simply needs fill with a guad-
byte offset such as 0x02020202 and put your payload at that
offset. You don't care where the stack-pointer is. You find
out how many bytes of 0x02 are necessary to get to that offset
on an experimental system, it is independent of the stack-pointer
value. It depends only upon the size of the buffer you are
exploiting, which needs to not change, of course.
When the return instruction occurs, one of those 0x02020202
will be encountered and your payload gets executed next.
Note that you should chose a different repeating-byte
than I have used here. Get the address of _end on a 'C'
program for hints.
