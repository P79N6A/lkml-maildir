Overstatement.
Solaris runs on x86 platform, and runs quite well.
And guess what - DTrace runs on x86 like a charm.

I must admit I don't know OProfile.
But can you profile already running application without interuption (not 
to mention stopping it) to it? Sure, DTrace introduces some overhead but 
if it's not acceptable just stop DTrace and application again runs with 
its original speed.
What about getting structure contents, function arguments and returns, 
etc... all on the fly. And then D languages which saves a lot of time with 
its aggregations, thread local variables, speculations. Sure you can use 
Perl, AWK, and so on - but it takes time - a lot of time.

I think you missed the point.
DTrace is not only about kernel, and it's definitly not a tool for ONLY 
kernel developers. It's a great tool for user land developers and for sys 
admins. And it's really easy (well...) to corelate data from kernel and 
application. All in production and it just works.
I think Tomasz was writing not only about kernel/system uptimes but also 
about application uptimes. And DTrace can help in both cases.
Coming back to kernel - if you have for example some kind of memory leak 
in kernel then support guys can provide you with DTrace script, see what's 
going on and get problem solved without unnecessary system restarts. Then
provide you with new kernel (patch). So even if enterprise user do not 
want recompile its own kernel, if there's a kernel problem DTrace can save 
him some downtime.

Sure it's one of its values.
I would add safety of running DTrace in a production. In fact it sould be 
number one feature. DTrace does great job in preventing you from crashing 
system or applications.
I would add that there is easy (at least a lot easier then without DTrace)
way to understand what's going on in system and which appliacation and why 
is cousing it. For example Bryan example with xcalls. And all of that in 
production systems.
Sure, you can make your own module on Linux, load it and trace whatever 
you want. But:
   1. it's not easy
   2. requires quite knowledge about kernel
   3. could easly crash your kernel
   4. takes time
   5. only kernel level - what about applications and correlation between
      apps and kernel?
   ...
   ...
My point is DTrace is really awesome tool.
Sure you can do many things without DTrace but it will take much more 
time. And there are a lot of things you can do with DTrace which are 
really hard to do in a production using it.
It just saves your time and gives you answers to questions you would not 
even ask before DTrace 'coz of inacceptable time it would take to answer 
them. It's really 'fun' to see what's going on in system and/or 
appliactions with DTrace.
My post sounds almost like marketing crap - but it is really what I find 
in DTrace. I must admit that I did not really appreciate this tool until 
I've started using it.
