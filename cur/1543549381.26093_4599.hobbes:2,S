LVM and MD have nothing common. They're two completly orthogonal piece of code
(you can put LVM on top of MD but that's just because of the nice reentrance of
the blkdev API as you can run loop on top of ext2 on top of ramdisk).  I don't
think it's good idea to mix LVM and MD in the same directory. LVM should live
in drivers/lvm not drivers/md.
