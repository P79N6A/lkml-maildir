Hi!
make menuconfig clips lines which do not fit:
  │   Depends on: !X86_VOYAGER && !X86_NUMAQ && !X86_VISWS &&
!IA64_HP_SIM && (IA64 || X86) &&  │
I was able to view the whole line by making my console window wider,
but that may not always be possible so I think it might be better to
wrap long lines.
