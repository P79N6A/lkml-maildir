The new implementation is in place and working in 2.2.6 
and 2.2.7 with some blemishes to be ironed out in a new 
patch hopefully to be ready for 2.2.8 (it's with ac 
now). The interface is just the tip of the iceberg. 
It will not change.
The driver has been accepted by David Mosberger-Tang
(sane) and Monty (cdparanoia) as a reasonable (but not 
necessarily the best) compromise. Monty has a cdparanoia
III alpha that uses some of the new features. Various 
other developers (some working for big corporations)
seem to be happy with the progress.
Joerg Schilling holds out with his own interface on 
top of my implementation. He conveniently neglects to 
mention that he has borrowed about 1200 lines of my code 
which I continue to maintain. The problem with this is 
the bug fixes + minor implementation improvements that 
have been added in the last 7 weeks (since he forked the 
code). Hopefully with time he will either drop this
approach of use run time selection in his transport 
library to support both (and I have supplied such a 
patch).
It seems as though some people want this debate 
re-opened and I will shortly make a posting to the
linux-scsi list which seems like the correct place. 
That post will challenge most of the technical claims 
made in the above documents which I ignored in the 
forlorn hope that Joerg would, in time, relent. 
I will do my best to ignore the personal accusations.
