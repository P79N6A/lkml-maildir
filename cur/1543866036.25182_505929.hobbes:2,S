Example: crypto api. SCSI. firewall "expert mode". Any number of things.
Qutie often, the questions themselves are *conditional*. For example, look 
at the whole INPUT layer thing. It is a real question, but only for 
EMBEDDED - normally, we just assume we'll use it (but it's a classic 
example of where we could have used a "select" from the keyboard driver 
instead).
For normal people, it's a question that simply shouldn't be asked. You 
don't ask normal users whether they want to hook up keyboards and mice 
(and trust me when I say that: we _used_ to ask. It generated tons of 
totally idiotic noise).
