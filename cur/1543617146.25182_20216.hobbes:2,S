The development sources for e2fsprogs will already work with diet
libc.  Unfortunately, diet libc doesn't do shared libraries, so
resulting binaries are sufficiently big that I doubt they would be
interesting for initrd and rescue floppy applications (which is why I
tried the experiment in the first place).
In any case, given that e2fsprogs is already portable to NetBSD and
Solaris (the latter so I can run purify to catch memory errors), it
shouldn't be particularly difficult to get e2fsprogs to run on some
other alternative libc.
