Only activities with no deadlines are postponed. And therefore RCU is good 
for the latencies of the application. No high-priority, low-latency task
should bother spend time traversing and freeing a complicated datastructure.
Defer that to some lower priority task.

That put_task_struct uses RCU is a hack to defer the job to a lower 
priority task. I think the right solution is to  defer the job to a lower 
priority task using a cheaper mechanism. put_task_struct() is used from 
high priority tasks in the priority inheritance code and should only do 
the minimal job of defering the real work to another task.
