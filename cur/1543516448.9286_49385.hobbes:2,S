Define "A real UNIX" for me, as you obviously mean something different
to what I understand it to be - or, for that matter, what the authors
of the various different UNIX clones I've used in my 20 years as a
programmer understand it to be.

{Shrug} It's not my fulltime job, but I quite happily handle the full
linux-kernel feed, together with several other mailing lists - my
mailbox averages somewhere between 500 and 700 new messages a day.
However, that's beside the point: My comment was simply to explain why
the author might not get as many replies as they might expect, and was
NOT a criticism of any sort.
It happens to be fact that such happens, as is the fact that some
people have spam filters that kill any mail containing the word
"subscribe" because of the number of such messages that reach the
various mailing lists instead of majordomo or listserv or whatever.
As a result, such people would not have even seen that message in
the first place.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
