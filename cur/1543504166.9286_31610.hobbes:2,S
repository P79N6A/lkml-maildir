Hi.
	I've got system with 512MB memory. There'r big files (only for
reading) which are being cached during reading. Lets say we have about
400MB cached data (as top says). But after few hours this disappears, adn
we've got only about 4MB chaed files - memory during this time wasn't
needed (nothing else is working there).
How can I stop Linux to flush cached data out if memory is NOT needed?
