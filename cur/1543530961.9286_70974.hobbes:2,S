Subject: NMI trap on Athlon KX133

I recently got a 700MHz Athlon and an Epox EP-7KXA motherboard (uses
the VIA KX133 Apollo chipset) and have been running into problems.  I
just noticed on boot-up that I get this message:
	Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 3d.
	Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
	Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
The problems I'm having are complete lockups when I am doing large
compiles (i.e. the kernel).  I can run povray all day long without
problems, but as soon as I try to compile the kernel, it will usually
lock up in the middle of the compile.  I don't know whether the NMI
message I'm getting could be a sign of a bad CPU, memory, motherboard,
or a combination.  I could just have something configured wrong.
Before I spam the list with my configuration, I thought I would see if
anyone has thoughts on what may be occurring.  Other things I tried
with no luck were using SCSI instead of IDE, removing one of the DIMMs
(I have 2 PC133 128MB Micron DIMMs) and trying each one separately,
and lots of different memory and CPU settings.  Any help is
appreciated.
