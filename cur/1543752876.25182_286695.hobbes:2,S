The ibm-acpi module included in 2.6.10 doesn't appear to parse
parameters correctly. This seems to be due to a patch from Rusty Russell
[1] which attempted to fix up the parameter parsing. Unfortunately, it
seems that the parameters have to be parsed /after/ module_init has been
called, as otherwise the parsing code calls acpi functions that fail. If
the init function is called first, everything works as it should do. (I
haven't actually looked closely enough at the driver to work out what
it's doing, but...)
What's the right way of fixing this?

 - without this, everything
works. With it, parameter setting fails.
