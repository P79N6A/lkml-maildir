I can do whatever cryptoapi offers (and isn't too complicated).

Compression is something that is fine in the loop driver but when done
read-only (because it can be backed by something that isn't limited to
do I/O on sector boundaries) but very hard to do in the block layer,
especially read-write. It should really be done in a filesystem because
you have to do dynamic allocation and such things and you can't even
guarantee a certain disk size.

No, it doesn't do anything. These things should be done entirely in
userspace.
