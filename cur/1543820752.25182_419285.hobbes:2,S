It can be. If one applies a rough estimate, reading only 512MB/s
from the same file from pagecache on each CPU simply cannot scale
past about 16 CPUs before it becomes tree_lock bound (depending
on what sort of lock transfer latency numbers one plugs into the
model).

I think something like postgresql, which uses a WAL via pagecache, things
that use shared memory (which is more important now that fork got lazier.
And it isn't even reading from the same file in multiple threads (although
that's obviously my poster child).
If one has F files in cache, and N CPUs each accessing a random file, the
number of files whos tree_lock a CPU last touched is F/N. The chance of a
CPU next hitting one of these is (F/N) / F = 1/N -> 0 pretty quickly.
include/ perhaps.
Now this won't be so bad as everyone piling up on a single cacheline, but
it will still hurt, especially on systems with fsb bus, broadcast snoop
(Opteron, POWER) etc.
Nor will it only be the read side which is significant. Consider a single
CPU reading a very large file, and each node's kswapd running on other CPUs
to reclaim pagecache (which needs to take the write lock).

Although that's lockless so it scales. find_get_page will overtake it
at some point.
