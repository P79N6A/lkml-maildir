Might be relevant: I saw similar behaviour on a sparc64 at about
2.6.8-rc1 time - I could use only 2 pty's. That was with a kernel with
PREEMPT turned on. The specific kernel gave BUGs and oopses because
PREEMPT is not finished on sparc64 and I thought that the pty problem
was caused by broken PREEMPT. I turned PREEMPT off and haven't seen the
problem since then (running 2.6.8-rc4 currently).
