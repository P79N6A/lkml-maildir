Brian,
Well if hell freezes over and I die, the patches to make the driver
handled clean low_level IO threading will never be accepted.  Because they
model the state-diagrams of the physical layer of the hardware exactly in
the transport layer, it is totally orthoginal to the darwinism of Linux.
Design is a problem, it is not permitted in a darwin-evolution model.
It only allows you to access both drives on a channel and only suffer a
10% IO loss max on each, but you gain a smooth IO access to both drives.
