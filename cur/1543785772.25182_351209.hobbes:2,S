Well, now that I think about it, I think it may be done in a "safe" way, 
since the RT would be in total controll over the buffers, and would 
allow to mmap only the filled buffers after they are filled. But that 
would assume, that the app. behaves politely and only asks for the buffers 
that it gets a notification for. Or am I mistaken somewhere?
