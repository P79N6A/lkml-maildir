Or, for more verbosity, replace
installpkg /mnt/cdrom/slackware/l/glibc-2.2.5-i386-2.tgz
with
cd / # important, if done from say /root the oops doesn't happen
tar zxvf /mnt/cdrom/slackware/l/glibc-2.2.5-i386-2.tgz
(Then you can strace tar if listing each filename isn't enough for you.)

Ok, I've done this (returning -ENOENT from umsdos_solve_link instead of
oopsing). I guess I'll post the patches (one for 2.2, one for 2.4)
tomorrow after I test them some more. This seems in my limited testing
to improve stability and eliminate data loss vs. not having the patch,
but I need to test it a bit more first. (In any case, the patch only
makes a difference in cases that would have oopsed/segfaulted without
it.)
IOW, it's an incomplete (if not simply wrong) fix, but it could be
better than what's there now, maybe.
