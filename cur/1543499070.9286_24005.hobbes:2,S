   Explain this. Any decent hash function has the following properties:
   - non invertible (or not trivially so)
   (note that a good hash function need not be bijective, and I'd
   conjecture that it shouldn't be)
   I don't see the sensitivity here. 
The problem is that user's passwords are in a much smaller space, so you
can simply try to invert the has by trying all possible "typable"
passwords, which is small enough that that a brute-force attack is
tractable.
