On all of the 2.6 kernel versions I can remember, they all seemed to have a 
couple of strange lines flash on the screen when I rebooted just before the 
machine restarted, but the screen cleared too fast to read them. I 
eventually used my digital camera to take a video of the reboot process, and 
what's coming up is:
Please stand by while rebooting the system...
md: stopping all md devices.
md: md0 switched to read-only mode
psmouse.c: bad data from KBC - timeout
psmouse.c: bad data from KBC - timeout
Restarting system.
I don't recall seeing anything like the psmouse.c lines from 2.4 kernels. 
This machine has an Asus P4B533 motherboard and a Microsoft Wireless 
Intellimouse USB mouse (as well as Microsoft USB keyboard). There's no PS/2 
mouse connected, and I think the port is even disabled in the BIOS, but USB 
legacy is enabled so maybe that is somehow responsible? I'm currently 
running the Fedora test kernel 2.6.8-1.603 (based on 2.6.9-bk).
Anyone know what's causing this or if it's of any consequence?
