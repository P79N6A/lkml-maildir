i have just tried 5 different versions of the Flash plugin and i cannot 
reproduce this (flash games are still smooth and acceptable even with 
the system significantly overloaded with 5 infite loops or with a kernel 
build), so it would be nice if you could help me debug this problem.
The last version that worked for you was v11, correct? The biggest v11 
-> v12 change was the yield workaround, and while testing your workload 
i also noticed that all Flash versions except the latest one (9.0 r31) 
use sys_sched_yield() quite frequently. So it would be nice to know 
which plugin version you are using (and which Firefox version): you can 
check that by typing about:plugins into firefox. Furthermore, could you 
also try the following tune:
   echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_yield_bug_workaround
and this:
   echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_yield_bug_workaround
if none of this changes behavior then please send me the output of the 
following:
  strace -ttt -TTT -o strace.txt -f -p `pidof firefox-bin`
  < reproduce the lag in firefox >
  < Ctrl-C the strace >
  
and send me the strace.txt file (off-line, it's going to be large). 
Thanks,
	Ingo
