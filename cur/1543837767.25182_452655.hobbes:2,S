Btw, I have left the machine running with the 2.6.18-rc4 kernel and it
can keep running that for ~11hrs more (I'll ofcourse let you know if
errors show up during the night), then I have to reboot it back to the
2.6.11.11 kernel that it is stable with and it will need to run that
until ~wednesday next week before I can do further experiments.
So, if you want me to test any patches I'll need to recieve them
within the next 10 or so hours if I'm to have a chance to run with
them for a few hours tomorrow - otherwise testing will have to wait
for next week.
