-	---help---
-	  Audio DMA support for bt878 based grabber boards.  As you might have
-	  already noticed, bt878 is listed with two functions in /proc/pci.
-	  Function 0 does the video stuff (bt848 compatible), function 1 does
-	  the same for audio data.  This is a driver for the audio part of
-	  the chip.  If you say 'Y' here you get a oss-compatible dsp device
-	  where you can record from.  If you want just watch TV you probably
-	  don't need this driver as most TV cards handle sound with a short
-	  cable from the TV card to your sound card's line-in.
-
-	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will
-	  be called btaudio.
