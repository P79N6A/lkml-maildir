Yes, sorry, I should have mentioned that MIPSism in there.  I haven't tried,
but I imagine it wouldn't be that hard to adjust for other platforms.
(In case anyone isn't familiar with KSEG0ADDR on MIPS, it takes a physical
address as it's only paramter and returns a cacheable virtual address in
"kernel address segment 0" (0x80000000 - 0xafffffff) which is hardwire 1:1
mapped with physical address space).

That sounds nice, but I cannot imagine how much trouble it would be to
implement.

Actually, I've used that patch on a system that had a cramfs/xip and a jffs
partition on the same flash chip where the kernel was running xip out of
flash.  :-)
