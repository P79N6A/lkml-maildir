Hm, I'm a bit slow, but even with your second drawings, I still don't
understand this.  Can you add | and - lines to the drawing, it would
help me understand what you are trying to show here.

But there is a pci driver that implements the USB "bridge" from PCI to
usb.  It's a pci driver, and it shows up in the full device tree as
joining PCI to USB.  It's called uhci-hcd, ohci-hcd, or ehci-hcd
depending on the type of PCI USB controller you have.

Um, I don't understand, this is already there.

Have you looked at the /root directory in the driverfs mount?  It shows
all the devices hooked together like you are talking about.
Yes, the bus subdirectories are separate, but that's because they focus
on bus specific stuff, not the interlinking between the busses.  That's
shown in the /root tree.

My latest patches to convert the USB code to use the driver model are
at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/usb-2.5-driver
It's working pretty well now, thanks to the patches from Pat that are in
Linus's latest bk tree.

Again, I don't quite understand the drawing, sorry.

But what's the problem you are trying to solve?  How the devices
interact in the global device tree?  That's already shown properly.  Or
am I missing something here?

Hm, how does this bind the driver to the device?  What if the driver
doesn't want to bind to this device?  And how does userspace know what
pci device to bind to what driver?  Does it use the information in the
modules.*map file?  If so, that comes directly from the drivers
themselves, which are the ones knowing what devices they _should_ be
bound to, so why not let the driver themselves do the work (well
actually the very small function at
drivers/pci/pci-driver.c:pci_match_device() does the work).

Again, why?  And does this force the ->remove() function to be called?

Now this is a nice idea.  But I was thinking of moving the symlink from
the bus/pci/devices to be under the specific driver in
bus/pci/drivers/foo_driver.  That would show you at a simple glance
which driver is bound to which device.  But putting the name in the
device entry in the /root tree would be good enough too.

Watch out, there are lots of driver model changes already in Linus's
tree (post 2.5.31.)
