Hi David,
Yup, I know rpc.portmap isn't running, the point is that it wasn't running on either
2.2.17 or 2.4.X.  Isn't run level 1 supposed to only be the bare minimum of running
processes, a few kernel processes, init and getty.  No network services...
What's changed in the kernel to elicit this behavior?
Is there a better "faster" way to get root access at run level 1 w/o login & passwd
on 2.4.X?
No it's not an everyday occurance, but I was impatiently thinking the sytem had
locked up and rebooted a couple of times, so it got me wondering why 2.2.X and
2.4.X differ in this basic behavior.
