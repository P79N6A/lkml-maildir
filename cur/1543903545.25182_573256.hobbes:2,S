You are confusing "userspace" with "user tasks".  And not only that,
you often use the term "userspace" when you should say "user mode".
If you want I can explain the differences.

That is exactly what I have been talking about.  It may be different
from what you _thought_, but it's not different from what I actually
_said_.

Here's what you are missing:
The new kexec approach eliminates the freezer and relies instead on the
fact that none of the tasks in the original kernel can execute while
the new kexec'd kernel is running.  This means the new kernel can write
out a memory image with no fear of interference or corruption.
But it also means that tasks which otherwise would have been frozen are 
actually free to run before the kexec call is made (and after the call 
returns, if the kexec'd kernel returns back to the original kernel).  
Any driver which was written with the assumption that tasks would be 
frozen at those times will need to be changed.
For example, drivers know that they have to quiesce their device in
preparation for creating the memory snapshot.  But they assume that no
I/O requests will be made while the device is quiesced (because no user
task is capable of generating an I/O request if they are all frozen),
so the driver doesn't try to prevent such requests from reactivating
the device.
The situation as regards locking is harder to discuss since I don't 
know of any code examples to use as a guide.  The fact remains that if 
user tasks aren't frozen then they can make system calls, and while 
running in kernel mode they can acquire locks, which might cause 
problems -- even though I can't identify any definite examples.
Because of these problems, it's too early to start trying to use kexec
to avoid the need for the freezer.
Of course, exactly the same possible problems exist when one tries to
remove the freezer from suspend-to-RAM.  It has nothing to do with 
kexec in particular (and certainly nothing to do with ACPI).

I'm not designing anything!  _You_ are.  I'm merely pointing out
problems in your design which you haven't considered.

Look again; I wasn't talking about ACPI.  You have mixed up the issues
in this email thread.  (Not hard to do, since it has been a very long
and complicated thread.)

This and the rest of your email have no bearing on what I was talking
about, so I have snipped out the remainder.
