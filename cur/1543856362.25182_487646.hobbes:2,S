 Hello,
  given the recent patch for ds1337 initialization (drivers/i2c/chips),
 I would like to ask owners of DS1307, DS1337, DS1338, DS1339, DS1340, ST M41T00
 to give a try the rtc-ds1307 driver (drivers/rtc).
  I need to be sure that it works (and correctly initializes)
 all the chips that claims to support.
  Jean would be very happy if we can remove drivers from
 i2c/chips ;)
