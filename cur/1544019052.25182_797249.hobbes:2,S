When using ath9k with my home wireless
network I normally would see this message:

once for the whole session.
Now running ath9k in a hotel room
(or public location); I see this message numerous
amounts of time (taken from dmesg);

As for any connection issues(after adjusting sysctl.conf)
and adding: options wlan0 disable_hw_scan=1
to /etc/modprobe.d/options.
haven't experienced any issues(so far at least);
In any case; is this normal for public wifi
(since there is no key), or is this something
easily fixed by adjusting my .config?
