The one we used was 7.0, and it will be available late November or early
December. It's not 6.0 version, which requires more changes.
Looks like I need to resend another patch.
Thanks,
Jun

The patch is wrapped, and can't apply.
And what version of the Intel compiler is this for?  I tried to get a
previous version to build a kernel, but I had to change a lot more
things than you did (like build flags, etc.)
thanks,
