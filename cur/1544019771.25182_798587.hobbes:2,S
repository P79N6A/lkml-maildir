Right, that could be an option.
We will try to change our code which is a big effort as we try
to keep the code as unique as possible between the different
hosts we support (Linux, Solaris, Windows, Mac OS X).
Just to be sure: There is no other option than disabling interrupts
or calling disable_preemption() to prevent scheduling?
Kind regards,
Frank
