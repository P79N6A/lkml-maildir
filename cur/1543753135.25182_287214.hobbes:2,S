Uhh.. "(i + 8 - tos) & 7" makes no sense.
It's not only mathematically the same as "(i - tos) & 7", but I don't even 
see how you got to the "+ 8" in the first place..
Also, we're not using C++, so we don't do the "const" part of
	const unsigned int tos = ...
thing. So suggested version with trivial fixes appended (technically, you
don't need the "& 7" on the tos calculation either, but hey, at least that
one I see why it's there, and agree with - the compiler may well be able
to optimize both of these things away, so keeping the source in its
"logical" format makes sense). Does this still work for you?

Hmm. 
What happens if it was in MMX mode? If I remember correctly, different 
CPU's do different things for MMX (some rotate them so that "mmx0" is 
always the same as "st(0)", some don't, and/or have separate hw registers 
altogether for it)? I realize we don't probably care, I'm just wondering 
if somebody knows...
