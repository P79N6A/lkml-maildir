I see that Linus has added a comment and does not want to rename,
so that settles that half of that letter.
You propose to remove i_blksize.
Yes, a good plan, half an hour's work.
It is used in stat only, so we have to produce some value for stat.
Do you want to replace
	inode->i_blksize
by
	inode->i_sb->s_optimal_io_size
?
