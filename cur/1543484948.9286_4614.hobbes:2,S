So use locking. Or ressource allocation. If the user decides to do a
stupid thing which is not possible with the hardware, it's his own
fault.

This is the same "singing, dancing, we must do everything at the same
time" discussion that we had with the Amiga about 100 years ago
[1]. Look where it led us. [5]
The acceleration engine on a gfx board is a ressource. Some ressources
you can share between processes, then you can use it from more than
one process at a time. Some others you can't so you can either run a
high-speed accelerated game on an fb-console or run a high-speed
accelerated 3d application under X.  If your device supports seamless
state-saving and restoring, fine. If it doesn't, you must use
exclusive access. But I'm not interested in slowing down my high-end
state of the stuff board just because there are some twenty years old
graphics boards on no longer used architectures which may _not_
support a feature which my board does. [3]
I'm fscking tired of these "we must build one generic solution to end
all other solutions". Neither X nor anything else is the silver bullet
in every possible scenario. Yes, there _will_ be people who want to
run twenty Quake sessions [2] on twenty virtual consoles at
the same time. Why must we satisfy the needs of _these_ people? We
must satisfy the needs of _most_ people. And they either work _or_
play. No need to build a solution which puts a penalty on those.

[1] those "we can format two floppies at the same time, look, we're
better than crappy Windows" discussion, if anyone around here is old
enough to remember.
[2] or whatever the current famous state of the art 3d
kill-some-monsters shooter is.
[3] Along the road lies DirectX [4]
[4] Or Direct3D. Or ActiveX. Or whatever the current MS marketing
decided to call their game API.
[5] Thank godness.
