Hi all,
If you are maintaining the *official* web site for a Linux kernel
port, you may want to contact ftpadmin@kernel.org to have a link put
up on 
http://www.kernel.org/.
  This applies only to Linux proper, not
variants like ELKS or ucLinux.  Currently we have links for the
PowerPC and IA-64 ports only.
Thanks!
