AMD K6-2 uses 66, 95 and 100 MHz bus settings. There is patch of chips
which use AFR66 marking because they don't work reliably over that
bus frequency. So 333 and 380 use 95 MHz bus. Maybe people who have
problems with 350 but not with 333 whould try 300 to see if problems
start appearing again. Then you can say that it has something to do
with 100 MHz bus and work from there. You could also try to raise 
processor input voltage 0.1 Volts to see if that makes a difference. 
That shouldn't do any harm because it's still within specifications.

This problem was with Win95 and not with 98 and I can verify that
because my machine also runs Win98 for gaming use at 400 MHz (it's
overclocked but still it runs as fine as can be expected under Win98). 
Also there hasn't been any problems with linux but I'm using old
EDO-SIMMs so memory timing problems might not show up. My motherboard is
VA-503+ (V1.2) with newest BIOS.
