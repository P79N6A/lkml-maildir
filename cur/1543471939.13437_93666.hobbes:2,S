I don't think everyone really understands my problem...  I originally had
a dynamic ip given to me via dhcp.  I then had it switched the my static
ip: kevlar.cc.gettysburg.edu.  My box was up at the time the ip's changed,
and everything worked perfectly, my computer assumed the new ip.  After I
rebooted a few hours later however dhcpcd was giving me the no DHCPOFFER
message in my messages log.  Anyone have any idea why this may be?  Thanks
