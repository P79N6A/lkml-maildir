After disabling hald, things are ok.  I can read ROMs that have been mapped 
correctly.  The problem was that sn2 doesn't map all ROMs by default, so the 
qla card, which has a ROM, had it's resource structure filled with the value 
in its BARs, which was of course not a usable CPU address.  I can fix that 
for sn2, so the patch is ok with me.
