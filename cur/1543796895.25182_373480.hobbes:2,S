Huh?  That is just not true at all.  Please give us a bit more credit
than that.

What PCI errors are you speaking of?  We did that PCI work to fix a lot
of other machines that were having problems.  And yes, this did break
some working machines, and we are very sorry about this.  But in the
future, changes to this area will not cause this to happen due to the
changes made.
Please file a bug in bugzilla.kernel.org and let us know you are having
problems.  Otherwise we have no idea.

No, if you rely on a production environment for your stuff, stick with a
disto kernel which has been tested and is backed up by a company that
will maintain it over time.

If you can point out the "actual bugs" yes.  It sounds so simple from a
theoritical view, but we all know how well theory works in real life
sometimes...
We don't try to create new bugs they are the side affect of fixing other
bugs, or adding new features that other people need.  And again, if
those bugs aren't reported, we have no idea they are present.
