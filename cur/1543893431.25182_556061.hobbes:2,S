Forgot to include changes outside of drivers/net/wireless/mac80211/iwlwifi/
Zhu Yi is the maintainer for the iwlwifi driver (Cc: on this email)

We'll remove that from the Kconfig until we get the document updated
to reflect the current status.

We're working on this one.

From Table 19 in the IEEE 802.11 spec lists reason 4 a 
'disassociation due to inactivity'  Odd that it would happen during
 association.  Were you able to associate at all before you
started seeing the problem?

This may be related to mac80211's link activity detection
at times immediately following an association/reassociation.
I've seen similar behavior here; a temporary work around I am using is 
to disable the 'lost link detection' in mac80211.  
Can you try this and see if it helps your association situation (it 
may introduce other problems related to roaming and automatic 
disassociation...)

Loading the module with debug=0x40000 will turn on the the uCode event 
log dumping which may help in isolating the uCode reset problem.  Can
you load the module with the module parameter debug=0x40000 and send us 
the resulting syslog output when the error is tripped?
Thanks,
James
