Hmmm...  What about DEFINE_PER_CPU in include/asm-generic/percpu.h 
combined with setup_per_cpu_areas() in init/main.c?  So long as you want 
all the CPUs to start with the same initial values, it should work.

Another possible approach (but equally disgusting) is to use this static 
allocation approach, and have the SRCU structure include both a static and 
a dynamic percpu pointer together with a flag indicating which should be 
used.
