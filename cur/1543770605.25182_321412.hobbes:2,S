This is puzzling.
In file included from drivers/firmware/pcdp.c:18:
drivers/firmware/pcdp.h:48: error: field 'addr' has incomplete type
drivers/firmware/pcdp.c: In function 'setup_serial_console':
drivers/firmware/pcdp.c:27: error: 'ACPI_ADR_SPACE_SYSTEM_MEMORY' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/firmware/pcdp.c:27: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/firmware/pcdp.c:27: error: for each function it appears in.)
First, I thought this was a simple missing
#include <acpi/actypes.h>
in drivers/firmware/pcdp.c
But it still spat out the same warning.
