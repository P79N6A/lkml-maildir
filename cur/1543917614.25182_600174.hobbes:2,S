By "sti part", you mean the full "sti; hlt" sequence of safe_halt,
right?  Since it needs to be an atomic sequence to avoid race
conditions, so the native sequence has to be precisely "sti; hlt" to
take advantage of the sti shadow, and other pv-backends will need their
own way to guarantee this atomicity.
But I'm quite happy to put plain "hlt" into cpu_ops as halt_cpu() or
something (and perhaps rename safe_halt to something a bit more
descriptive).

The lazy interface has needed a rethink anyway.
