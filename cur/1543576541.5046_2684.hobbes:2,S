Advancing further to a 2.4-test12 kernel (with the latest available
8139too driver - 0.9.12) improves the situation even further, but doesn't
solve it.
I still cannot "ping -s 5000 192.168.0.55" from the 8139too machine, but
at least I can now FTP the 2.4-test12 kernel (18 MB) from another machine
to the 8139 target without any stalls. The rather major problem that
remains is performance.
As before: 
  * 192.168.0.77 = 8139too (2.4-test12, SuSE 7.0); 
           HP Omnibook 800; P133; 48 MB
  * 192.168.0.55 = eepro100 (2.2.16, SuSE 7.0);
           Sony VAIO Z600NE, PIII 650, 256 MB
FTP from 192.168.0.55 (eepro100) to 192.168.0.77 (8139too):
  put linux-2.4.0-test12.tar.bz2
    18975167 bytes sent in 00:48 (385.71 KB/s)
  get linux-2.4.0-test12.tar.bz2
    18975167 bytes received in 00:05 (3.18 MB/s)
FTP from 192.168.0.77 (8139too) to 192.168.0.55 (eepro100):
  get linux-2.4.0-test12.tar.bz2
    18975167 bytes sent in 00:34 (530.39 KB/s)
  put linux-2.4.0-test12.tar.bz2
    18975167 bytes sent in 00:05 (3.13 MB/s)
IOW, when the 8139too driver itself *delivers* data (put initiated from
192.168.0.77, get initiated from 192.168.0.55), I get 3 MB/s throughput,
pretty much what I would expect.
When the 8139too driver gets data pushed down its throat (get initiated
from 192.168.0.77, put initiated from 192.168.0.55), then performance
plainly does not exist.
Any ideas?
TIA!
