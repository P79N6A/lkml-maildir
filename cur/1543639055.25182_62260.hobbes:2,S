The non sysadmin people care that is has not change, and generally
prefer that its the same ordering as windows seems to use. Once you go
to modular IDE it gets trickier. Certainly if you load modules the usual
bets are off (as with scsi)
It is possible to take a serial like approach and we could say
	if(pci && southbridge_has_ide_device())
		reserve_ide0();
That would ensure the southbridge IDE stayed in one place. Another
alternative is to enumerate all the IDE devices by class (we can do that
nice and easy, with a little tweak for the fasttrak stuff) then hand
them off according to the enumeration position. That would preserve the
old semantics nicely for pci IDE. (Plug in ISA IDE is pretty rare and
since we can't probe those its kind of hard to do anything much about
it).
Andre is currently dealing with some of this in the main IDE code
