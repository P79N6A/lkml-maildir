For the past 3 days under heavy disk usage I've been recieving   
errors causing a remount I don't know if it was becuase of heavy usage and
these are cheap harddrives or me moving /var and /usr to a larger
partion but here is one of the instances:
I was taring this partion (hda5) when this happened and was also taring 
hda7 my / when it happened there to before this one a day earlier.
