Subject: anyone want an Indy?

I have an Indy with a drive, IRIX is installed, and I have no need for it.
If there is a Linux kernel person who wants it and will do something
useful (like support Linux on it or anything else which is for the
general good of the Linux effort) contact me and I'll ship it to you.
Cheers,
