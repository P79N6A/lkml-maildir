Eh?  Why isn't it?  I keep it open for weeks if it doesn't crash.

Then your system works for you, but it doesn't make anything available 
for anyone else nor does it allow for anything other than the simple 
collection of emails/patches.  That's the point of an accessible 
database.  Over years of development, trying to maintain a comprehensive 
system would require you to index what "25" relates to.
The point of this DB in discussion is to make it easier for everyone, 
from developer to the random person who only reads lkml when he needs to 
find an answer.  Make it easier to research, catalog, reference, 
explain, and derive all the parts of a given bug.
For example, the ECN issue.  Anyone from developer to Joe Admin could 
look up "connection failed" and get back a group of results with a high 
"ECN" hit rate.  A few seconds to type it in and a minute later he has 
probably put 0 in tcp_ecn and happily wanders away.
