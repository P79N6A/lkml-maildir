I've read it by now, thanks for the reference.

Is there way to influence what is considered free space for the
wandering blocks or is it a fixed algorithm? If the latter, what is the
access pattern on the free space (like pseudorandom, cyclic linear,
hashed)?

That certainly doesn't stop me from trying... :)
Have you ran any tests to test the durabilty of your "transcrash" system
for instance against sudden power dropouts?
Is the filesystem selfhealing or does one need fsck.reiserfs for it? If
the latter: will it do the right thing (i.e. automatically bring the
system into consistent shape not like ext3) when invoked with "-y"?
