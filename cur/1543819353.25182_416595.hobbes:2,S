Documentation/SubmittingPatches is almost everything you need to know on
how to submit a patch for inclusion in the kernel source tree.
Documentation/HOWTO is also a good place to start with, as it has a few
pointers to other locations in the Documentation tree, and on the web,
for things to read on how to do this.
Hope this helps,
