Ahh. Fair enough. I didn't have any lawyer look at it, I just don't like 
assuming.

I'd much rather do the social work, not so much necessarily for legal 
reasons, but for my own menal well-being. It's just _so_ much nicer to 
work with a code-base where none of the authors might complain about being 
included.
So even if the original license is GPL-compatible, just the fact that Jari 
doesn't want his work re-licensed means that I don't want his work in the 
kernel - whether it's a legal issue or not. 
Now, I obviously believe that Jari has acted like an ass, since he has
used the very same code under the GPL before, but hey, that's his problem. 
Jari - please stop distributing your loop-aes patches. If you consider the 
license to be non-GPL-compatible, then you have no business distributing 
the thing as kernel patches. Alternatively, just say it's GPL'd. You can't 
have it both ways.
