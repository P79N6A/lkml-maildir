Thinks for trying. I finally found the problem myself.
There is some incompatability between syslinux 2.10 and kernel 2.6.10
Using lilo on the first floppy fixed the problem
Oh, and no I am *not* using an initrd. I am using the old paramiters
that cause the kernel to load the ramdisk after it boots.
