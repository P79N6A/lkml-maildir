 From a design standpoint, keyboard layour should obviously
be a per-VT thing. One mapping table per VT, switching happening
automatically as every keypress gets filtered throught the
current VT.
Simple design, but perhaps that is more work than anyone
care to do on the current stuff. It can also be argued that the
actual keyboard necessarily is the same for all VT's, so
they ought to all use the same layout. If my "x" is in an
odd place, then it is so for all VT's, if there are "volume control"
buttons, then they exist for all VT's and so on.
In the multiseat case there are several possibly dissimiliar
keyboards, but then they have separate event devices too.
