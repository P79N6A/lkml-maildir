Hi Dave,
Could you please change this to read version 1.30 of e2fsprogs?  There
were some rare conditions where e2fsck could get confused with htree
directories in e2fsprogs 1.29 that were fixed in 1.30.  None of the
htree-related e2fsck bugs in 1.29 were catastrophic in the sense of
causing data loss, but they might cause confusion and spurious kernel
bug reports.
Thanks!!
