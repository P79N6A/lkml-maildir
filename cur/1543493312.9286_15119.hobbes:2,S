Hi everybody.
I have been told to post here the following problem. I hope it
is the right place. My apologies if it isn't :-).
Here's what I'm running:
Debian/GNU Linux 2.0 , kernel 2.0.36
CPU: Pentium 166, 64MB RAM
Network interface: IBM Token Ring
The machine is a mildly loaded web- news- ftp- server which
has been running for a long time and has never crashed until today,
where it crashed twice in a couple of hours. Attached is the relevant
syslog section. The log shows several token-ring errors just before
the crash, but that may just be a coincidence, as that does happen
every now and again, but the machine never crashed before.
I have now activated some logging on the IP packet flow, to see
whether someone is playing tricks on the machine, just in case.
Thank you for any help you'll be able to give.
Cheers
