You are taking the wrong approach.
The _only_ question that matters is:
Why is it technically impossible to do the same in userspace?
If it's technically possible to do the same in userspace, it must not be 
done in the kernel.
That's exactly the reason why e.g. kernel 2.6 does not contain a 
webserver.

Which part of this is technically impossible when doing key management 
in usespace?
