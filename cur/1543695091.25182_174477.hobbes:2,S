Obviously I'm not suggesting it as a normal method of support, it's
just another option.  There might be times when a desk and a normal
computer are more than five minutes away, and having something to
think about on the way there is useful.

Nothing, but if we were going to export configuration data at all, it
might as well be done using something more light weight than HTTP and
HTML.
Maybe the wristwatch example was a bit extreme, but what about a
system with very low bandwidth for connectivity?  What if you were
trying to get configuration data back from a spacecraft millions of
miles away?  At 300 BPS or less, and hours of latency, Gopher starts
to look a bit more realistic than getting a shell prompt via ssh :-).
