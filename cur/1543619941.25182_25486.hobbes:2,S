Rather than a signal, it should be a file descriptor of some sort, so
one can select() etc on it.  Personally I can't imagine polling would
take any appreciable amount of resources, though.
A more important issue is probably to get notification when the eject
button is pushed and the device is locked, so that it can try to
umount and eject it, unless busy.
