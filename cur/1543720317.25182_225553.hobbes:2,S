If it helps, I'm listening.
Suggestions/proposals for new features etc, if they're a good idea, I
can help push inside via our SATA/T13 reps.  Note that as per all
long-lived specs with multiple revisions, changing the behavior of an
existing feature to something incompatible is virtually never
feasable.

Lo siento, I wasn't around when that occurred.  Of course, that other
bigger OS has a very large installed base, and selling a drive that
breaks it is corporate suicide.
