The preemptible kernel work just takes the current SMP code, and
allows it to work on a single processor.  You are not interruptted if
you have a lock held.  This makes the number of cases in the kernel
simpler, and should improve maintenance as more people will be
affected by the SMP issues.
Right now there is a preemptible kernel patch being maintained
somewhere.  I haven't had a chance to look recently.  But the recent
threads on low latency mentioned it.
As for rules.  They are the usual SMP rules.  In earlier version there
was a requirement or that you used balanced constructs.
i.e.
spin_lock_irqsave
...
spin_unlock_irqrestore
and not.
spin_lock_irqsave
...
spin_unlock
..
restore_flags.
