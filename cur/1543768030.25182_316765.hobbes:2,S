I mean that at the moment, the suspend code doesn't seem to spin down
any SCSI drives.  However, if it did we'd need to distinguish between
drives that uniquely belong to us (i.e. drives that are internal to the
system) and drives that are external on a shared bus for which we'd
annoy other systems if we spun them down.
