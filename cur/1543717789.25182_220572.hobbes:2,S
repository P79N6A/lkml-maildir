Hey, don't kill the messenger for bringing bad news.
loop-AES wasn't born perfect. But I have plead quilty for each and every
fuck-up that was there. And then went on and fixed the damn code.
Countermeasures against optimized dictionary attacks was included in 2001,
and stronger IV in 2003.
May I suggest that you do the same. Better late than never.

In the past you, Fruhwirth, have demonstrated that you don't understand what
the security holes are. The fact that you still don't seem to undertand,
does not mean that the holes are not there.

Optimized dictionary attack is exploitable. Ok, it requires major government
size funding, but what do you think NSA guys get paid for?
Watermark attack is exploitable using zero budget.

I doubt it, but I'm waiting...

You insisting that cryptoloop/dm-crypt do not have exploitable security
issues does not increase confidence at all. Quite the contrary, as it
implies that existing vulnerabilities won't be fixed.

Initial crypto merge for mainline mount and losetup included support for
gpg-encrypted key files, and seeded+iterated key setup. This support was
merged to util-linux-2.12-WIP (work in progress). One cryptoloop developer
somehow managed to convince util-linux maintaner to drop those
countermeasures against optimized dictionary attacks. To protect the guilty,
I won't name his name here, but search linux-crypto archives for 14 Mar 2003
11:12:13 -0800 posting if you want know his name. Final util-linux-2.12 was
released with those countermeasures removed. In my opinion that was
deliberate implanting of exploitable vulnerability to mainline mount and
losetup. I call that backdoor. You call that whatever you want.
