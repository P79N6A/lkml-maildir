#1: Start less crap at boot time. Obvious but thats frequently most of
    the issue.
For Red Hat if your hardware set up is constant then rpm -e kudzu will do
no harm and avoid the grovelling through the box looking for new toys.
Longer term swsuspend means you can bang alt-sysrq-Z and suspend to disk
without BIOS support
