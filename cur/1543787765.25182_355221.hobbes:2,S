Even 16K is too much, IMHO.

It seems, yes. However, I assure you that this is not going to
work for anyone who has anything reasonable swapped out, because
of the kmalloc().
16K is an order 2 allocation on systems with 4KB pages, such as
Opteron. It kinda sorta works, but not really.
This looks like a requirement to think about a better API. Also,
the things that Harald was trying to fix, with pids and signals,
just tell me that something was really wrong from the start.
