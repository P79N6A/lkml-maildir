Exactly, there may well be overlap between Xen and the kexec hibernate 
approach, for which code structures should definitely be leveraged.
And, I wasn't suggesting to use Xen as an HV, which wouldn't really solve 
anything, but was trying to point out that there is no need to maintain two 
separate kernels, much like Xen, which inlines two modes into the kernel:  
host and guest.
So kexec really seems the way to go, which mimics the way APM used to do it, 
which is known to work flawlessly with minimal OS involvement.
Thanks!
