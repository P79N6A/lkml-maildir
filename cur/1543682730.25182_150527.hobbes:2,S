As you might know, the Compu-Shack fddi products reached end-of-life
last year.

As I can't locate the code sequence in my driver module, please check it
with your compiled kernel:
  objdump -d vmlinux | grep -A 20 "7e f5" | grep csfddi
or module:
  hexdump -e '32/1 "%02x " "\n"' csf.o | grep "7e f5 e9 e8"
Do you get a result like the code line from your oops, which eip is
referring to?

But you got two different decoding results, didn't you ?!
