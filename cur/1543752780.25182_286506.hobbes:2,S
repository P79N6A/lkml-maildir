Don't count on me here. I do not even know /which/ situations might
introduce signals or wait queue events at this point. The only one that
occurred to me is when nodemgr is about to be killed. In this situation,
it is hardly beneficial to continue with the login. But there may be
other events I do not know about which should not result in sbp2 giving
up. Sorry, I should have been clear about this in my previous post.

Or rather, it is not that important (although desirable) to always wait
for 1000ms. This is just necessary for when another initiator was logged
in into the target but did not reconnect or login again immediately
after a bus reset. (Assuming the other initiator or the local host or
the target require exclusive login, which is more common than concurrent
login.)

Well, what might those events be? May we hold them off for one second?
(Or perhaps even longer if we are about to login to several targets.)
Should sbp2 proceeed to login when such events occur? I can't answer
this for sure. Sorry,
