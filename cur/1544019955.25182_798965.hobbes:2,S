I guess I was the one starting to use this function, so some explanation:
When the drm device is used to provide address space for buffers, 
user-space actually see it as a file with a distinct offset where 
buffers are laid out in a linear fashion, To access a certain buffer you 
need to lseek() to the correct offset and then read() write() or, the 
more common use, mmap / munmap.
When looking through its implementation, unmap_mapping_range() seemed to 
do exactly the thing I wanted, namely to kill all user-space mappings of 
all vmas of all processes mapping a part of the device address space. 
And it saves us from storing a list of all vmas mapping the device 
within the drm device.
What makes usage of unmap_mapping_range() on a device node with a well 
defined offset-to-data mapping different from using it on a file?
