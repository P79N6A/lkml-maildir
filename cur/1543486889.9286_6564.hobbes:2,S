Greetings,
	I have found that if I have a process which is running on a mounted
filesystem, and I kill -9 that process, the filesystem is unable to be
umounted.  It thinks the filesystem is still in use.  /proc/*/cwd includes
nothing in the directory, and all the processes in there were certainly
killed anyway.  Is this something that's broken, or should umount allow -f
(whether that's kernel or app I'm also not sure)?
