	Get Samba 2.0.3.  I've got several fixes for related problems
in that version.  The one with 2.0.2 was definitely broken, especially
if it prompted you for the password.

	Usually, it's a session disconnect.  The smbmount daemon is suppose
to wake back up and reconnect the session on the next request.  One problem
was that it didn't cache the password if you didn't supply it on the command
line or in an environment variable.  Since it had disconnected from the
terminal, it could no longer prompt for your password and it got lost.
