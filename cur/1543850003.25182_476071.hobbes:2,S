Thanks for the patch! Please always look up the MAINTAINERS entry for 
the code you are modifying and CC the developers on patches.

Your mailer ate tabs and wrapped long lines. You're going to need to fix 
that.

There is no need to store a geo reference here. You can use 
zd_chip_to_mac() to go from chip to mac, then mac-to-ieee80211 is easy.

Typo, you mean boundary. Also, I think the debug message can go once 
you're confident it's working correctly.

This added line could go as well.

I think that after the above changes, your modifications to zd_chip.h 
can be removed.
