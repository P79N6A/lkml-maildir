Apologies, you gave me the answer I was looking for (make is  
'intelligent' enough not to build the same file twice in this  
situation...) but I think you may have missed the makefile in the  
lzo1x directory:

Thus, the Kconfig options for compress/decompress won't be simply  
'dummy' options...
Given the shared private header between the compress and decompress  
code, I don't think there is any need to separate the code into two  
directories a la the zlib code.
Sorry for noise,
