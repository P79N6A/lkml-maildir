Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'drm-patches' branch from
git://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-patches
This contains updates to the radeon and via drm drivers and cleans up the
ati pcigart code in order to add support for the integrated rs480 chipsets.
It also pulls in some fixes for via and radeon drivers from the DRI teams.
Hopefully I got the diffstat correct..
Dave.

     radeon: Don't mess up page flipping when a file descriptor is closed.
     There can still be other contexts that may use page flipping later on, so do
     just unilaterally 'clean it up', which could lead to the wrong page being
     displayed, e.g. when running 3D apps with a GLX compositing manager such as
     compiz using page flipping.

     drm/radeon: upgrade to 1.27 - make PCI GART more flexible
     radeon: make PCI GART aperture size variable, but making table size variable
         This is precursor to getting a TTM backend for this stuff, and also
         allows the PCI table to be allocated at fb 0
     radeon: add support for reverse engineered xpress200m
         The IGPGART setup code was traced using mmio-trace on fglrx by myself
         and Phillip Ezolt <phillipezolt@gmail.com> on dri-devel.
         This code doesn't let the 3D driver work properly as the card has no
         vertex shader support.
         Thanks to Matthew Garrett + Ubuntu for providing me some hardware to do this
         work on.
