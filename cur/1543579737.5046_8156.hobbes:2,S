and potentially no end of weird problems if you have mac users editing
your code...  suddenly a compiler may ignore the rest of a file starting
at a given // or # comment, and you'll find its caused by their
different linebreaks.  had this problem with php.  havent seen it with C
yet.  does gcc handle non-correct^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hunix linebreaks now?  it
didnt when i used djgpp all those years ago.
