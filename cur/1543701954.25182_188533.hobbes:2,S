From your previous mail:
"I use ide-scsi + st for my Seagate ATAPI tape drive, so I welcome
your initiative. ide-tape has had many reliability problems in the
2.4 kernels, and the 2.5 bio changes left it broken from 2.5.12 or
so to 2.6.0-test<late>. It may have been repaired lately, but I for
one don't trust that code base any more."
So how do you know that ide-scsi+st is better? ;-)
Both ide-tape and ide-scsi are to stay in 2.6.x and die in 2.7.x.
