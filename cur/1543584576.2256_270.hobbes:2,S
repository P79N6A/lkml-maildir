With the current rd.c code, we can get into a situation where there is
a buffer-only page for data which is also in a page cache page with
page->buffers != NULL.  The current vmscan.c code never frees the page
cache page in this scenario, effectively doubling ramdisk memory
requirements.
Linus, I think this is a bugfix (tested against -ac kernels):

I don't think I'm missing anything important ...
