I have the same problem with Linux-2.4.21-pre6. I don't know when this started
to happen because I pretty much never halt my machine.

It's not a BIOS problem here. halt works pretty well with Linux-2.5.66 here.
It's most likely an ACPI problem. What happens here is that the code to power
down actually does not manage to turn the machine off, instead after a while
the NMI watchdog kicks in and the kernel oopses.
