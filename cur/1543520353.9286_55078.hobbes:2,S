	This is simply not correct, the new glibc threads are simply
the new, included in the libc LinuxThreads.  Linux has always used
kernel level threads, the only difference between a 'proc' and a
'thread' is 'procs' are heavy and 'threads' are a light as it were.
	LinuxThreads simply provides the access framework.
