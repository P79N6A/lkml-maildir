Hi Stefan,
just to make sure that the audioplay bit is not set in the capabilities page,
can you please try the following patch applied against 2.6.25-rc2 and send me
the output. Thanks!
@Bart: by the way, this cdi->mask thingy is kinda unintuitive doing double
negation to check whether a feature is supported or not. Yeah, this comes from
"above," i.e. uniform cdrom layer. But still, shouldn't we use a cdi->caps_flags
or something similar instead, which mirrors the caps page bits setting?
