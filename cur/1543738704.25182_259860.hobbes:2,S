dont worry about it not booting on your setup with PREEMPT_REALTIME, as
long as it boots with !PREEMPT_REALTIME - i only really converted my
testsystems which are basically IDE + e100/e1000/rtl8139, ext3 and the
bare minimum that is needed to run Fedora. It might be useful to send me
a bootlog if you have any easy way to capture it - if not it's not a big
problem either.
