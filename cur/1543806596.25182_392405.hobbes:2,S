You keep saying this. I'm talking about the general concept of
"avoid moving tasks when a schedule can be made", or some way to
reduce latencies in move_tasks. Obviously we are long past the fact
that this particular patch isn't the best implementation.

Actually my main argument is that it is not a realistic workload,
and that I'd prefer not to touch the fragile scheduler until I see
one. I think that's perfectly logical, but whatever.

Now I call that argument much more illogical than any of mine. How
can such a fine grained, essentially per-cpu lock be "central", let
alone "most central"? And even if it were central, why would that
make it obviously important?

But luckily the scheduler is basically completely non functional in
the presence of pinned tasks anyway, so this is the only time this
special case kicks in.
But sure, it is there. I don't see how that justifies more changes
in that place for no reason. As soon as I see a good reason then I'd
be more than happy to look into it myself.
