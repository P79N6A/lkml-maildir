shm already does it: shm_swap_core returns RETRY unless page count is
1.  file maps are close: file swapping already uses the address space
a_ops, but currently uses that at the wrong time: unmap time rather
than last-release.  Rik?

It's no different from mlock(): if you've got some reason why one
specific mapping can't be unmapped (either it's locked or it is
inherently non-swappable like a kiobuf), then there's no reason to
make that per-mapping information visible at the per-page level.
We allow multiple processes to mlock() the same page, after all.
Cheers, 
 Stephen
