Well, I'd say that it is *one* tool for debugging.
Now, Kprobes is another tool - and I'm just saying that I don't see why 
you should really expect to break one tool with the other. They take 
different approaches.
And yes, sometimes debugging *does* change what it debugs. In timing, if 
nothing else, but also in the kinds of things you can do. For example, we 
don't allow slab redzoning on data structures that have alignment 
restrictions not compatible with the redzoning, and I'd argue that this is 
more of the same: we just should not do DEBUG_RODATA if you expect to 
change read-only data.
There's just no *point*.
