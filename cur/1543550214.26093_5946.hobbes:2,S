Of course Mikael Petersson's perfctr patch has been providing such for a
while now, and many people use it. My forthcoming profiler makes use the
counters in a different way, but as long as such an API is clean enough to
allow the various different uses w/o hacky patches I think this would be a
great idea.
prumpf has been talking about using some counter information for
scheduling/VM purposes as well ...
thanks
