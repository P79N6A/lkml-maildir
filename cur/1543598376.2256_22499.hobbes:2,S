Not possible until the signal handling in the kernel is thread group
aware.  Grab Linus' patch from ten months os so ago, fix it, and get
it into the kernel.  Then we can rewrite the signal handling and make
getpid behave correctly.
Having said this, since this is a known deficiency no program should
use getpid for some critical unless it's absolutely necessary.
