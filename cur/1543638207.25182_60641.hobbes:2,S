It all gets a little confusing after 'million'. Either you mean a US 
'trillion', which is a European 'billion'; 10^12. Or you mean a European 
'trillion', which is a US 'quintillion'; 10^18.
In general, it's best to stick to the numeric form if it's greater than
10^6. With the possible exception of using 'milliard' for 10^9, which may 
cause the recipient to have to look up the word, but won't cause it to be 
misinterpreted as 10^12 by non-usians.
