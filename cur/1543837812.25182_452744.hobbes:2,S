Ah, okay, this means the original sequence of additions was the reverse
of
how I got to see these patches. I understand now, but am still
uncertain
about the need to annotate FIX_STACK() - especially since you use
.cfi_undefined, meaning the return point cannot be established anyway.
If at all I'd annotate the initial pushes with either just the normal
CFI_ADJUST_CFA_OFFSET, and the final one with one setting back the
CFA base to the now adjusted frame. That way, until the pushes are
complete the old frame will be used for determining the call origin,
and
once complete the (full) new state will be used.
Or annotate them so that the new values take effect immediately with
each push, but clearly without any CFI_UNDEFINED. That way, the
frame will be slightly inconsistent in between, which could be of
concern
once we also properly annotate the segment register spills/restores.

Either way, but if you leave them separate you should always send them
as pair, to make the intentions clear.
