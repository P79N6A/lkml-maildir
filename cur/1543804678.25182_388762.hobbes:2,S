where it didn't happen with the previous driver?  I guess thats a good
thing, kinda as we made the problem more frequent, hopefully we can
help fix it?
you don't happen to have TSO enabled do you?
please reply over at netdev at vger.kernel.org with the standard set
of information, lspci, dmesg, etc etc.
Thanks,
  Jesse
