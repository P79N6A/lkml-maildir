I believe all of our test plans are available publically.  We just put
up test runner on our bugzilla server so that we can better track which
tests have been run by users, etc.  Some tests are automated, some are
manual. 
The bugzilla site is 
http://bughost.org
 and test tracker is toward the
bottom of that page.

I am hopeful that if we can get a process streamlined enough so that
regression passes can occur quickly, we will be able to keep pace w/ any
critical fixes or changes that are desired to go into mainline.
What is driving the approach is that our customers want to build
solutions with drivers that have gone through a known level of
interoperability and functionality testing. 
We ideally want to be able to say "you can either download the driver
version X from 
http://whatever
, or any mainline kernel newer than
2.6.13+".  However we can only do that if the code that is pulled into
mainline /has/ gone through all of that testing.
The reality of the community process may require that we can only say
"version X from 
http://whatever
 or versions 2.6.{x,y,z} of the kernel"
if patches are accepted into the tree that haven't been sufficiently tested.
We want to have a process that meets the needs of the end users, the
ipw* and kernel development communities, the platform manufacturers, and
the distros.
