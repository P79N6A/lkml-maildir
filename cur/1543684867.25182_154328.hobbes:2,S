If you have UP_APIC or SMP enabled, then this is a known user-bug.
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK, CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE, and configuring APM
as a module instead of built-in, are known to do really bad things
with regard to BIOSen and the local APIC.
The fix, if you have APIC or SMP support, is to NOT misconfigure APM.
