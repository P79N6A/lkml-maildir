Would it not make more sense to just sanity-check the size itself, and
throw it out if the partition size (plus start) is bigger than the disk
size?
We already do that within extended partitions, ie we do
	if (offs + size > this_size)
		continue;
to just ignore crap. For some reason we don't do this for the primary one 
(possibly because we don't trust disk size reporting, I guess).
There might well be people use use partition type 0, just because they
just never _set_ the partition type.. I don't think Linux has ever cared
about any type except for the "extended partition" type, so checking for 
zero doesn't seem very safe..
