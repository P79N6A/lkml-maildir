No, you can use devfsd instead. You can configure it to chmod(2) an
inode on a disc-based FS whenever something chmod(2)s an entry in
devfs. This is almost exactly the same configuration that you'd use to
manage a disc-based /dev while mounting devfs on /devices.
Or you could write a script that updates your own purpose-built
permissions database. It's up to you. All the infrastructure is
already there.

So configure your system to do what you want. No problem.
