Probably.  I don't know when I will have time to try it.
(BTW, we should actually be able to probe subunits in parallel, however
I suspect that some firmwares will not tolerate this.)

This has to be a single line.

I don't know, perhaps names like "device_driver_matching_disable" and
"device_driver_matching_enable" would be more to the point.  Or do you
actually "freeze" (i.e. halt) ongoing driver probes?

Is this core-internal now?  If not, add a comment what it does and how
it has to be written and read.
I'm curious how this has to be used; perhaps it will turn out that the
whole thing is over-engineered this way.  I.e. there might be easier
options like:
  - Let subsystems which don't want multithreaded probing at all
    disable multithreaded probing globally by a susbsystem flag.
    (Or rather, let subsystems which want multithreaded probing
    enable it globally by a subsystem flag. IOW make singlethreaded
    probing the default.  Multithreaded probing has to be tested
    thoroughly for each subsystem.)
  - Let subsystems which want only partially multithreaded probing
    serialize the necessary regions on their own by subsystem-internal
    mutexes.
However, this really depends on what the actual cost of dev->depend is.

Ditto here:  Which of these belong to the public API?  Those flags which
are not private to the core need to be commented.
PS:  There is also a kerneldoc format for structs.  It also allows to
mark private struct members, i.e. those which do not belong to the API.
See Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt.
PPS:  Sadly, the whole struct device and some other driver core API
items lack kerneldocs.  It's ironic that the deprecated class_device is
the only drivercore struct which comes with a kerneldoc.
