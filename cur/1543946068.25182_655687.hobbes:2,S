blk_end_request: changing ide-cd (take 4)
This patch converts ide-cd (cdrom_newpc_intr()) to use blk_end_request
interfaces.  Related 'uptodate' arguments are converted to 'error'.
In PIO mode, ide-cd (cdrom_newpc_intr()) needs to defer
end_that_request_last() until the device clears DRQ_STAT and raises
an interrupt after end_that_request_first().
So blk_end_request() has to return without completing request
even if no leftover in the request.
ide-cd uses blk_end_request_callback() and a dummy callback function,
which just returns value '1', to tell blk_end_request_callback()
about that.

I looked at the commit again but nothing seems obviously wrong (probably there
was a silent change in the behavior of block layer API that upsets ide-cd)...
Kiyoshi/Jens: please follow up on this bug.
Thanks,
