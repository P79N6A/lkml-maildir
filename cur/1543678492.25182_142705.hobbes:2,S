Well, it doesn't restore the old behavior. With Linux-2.5.n (n <= 72)
I could do a fast double-press onto the pad to have a left-click. This
doesn't work after supplying "psmouse_noext=1" to the module. Further
more, Windowmaker's menus don't any longer automatically pop up - I have
to press a mouse button to make that happen.
GPM (with "autops2" driver) works as before, though.
XFree uses "PS/2" as it's driver, directly using (legacy) /dev/psaux
device...
I was quite okay with the old behavior (though I haven't tested XFree
with the specialized Synaptics driver).
