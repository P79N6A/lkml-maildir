I've got an NFS server, version 2.4.4, using reiserfs with trond's NFS
patches and the reiser-2.4.4 nfs patch.
On a client running 2.4.5 with trond's patches and the corresponding
reiser patches, I get the wierdest behaviour:
# on client
cp libgkcontent.so libgkcontent.so.x
diff libgkcontent.so libgkcontent.so.x
# no diff
# on server
diff libgkcontent.so libgkcontent.so.x
Binary files libgkcontent.so and libgkcontent.so.x differ
It _only_ happens in this file of all files I've tried out so far. I'm
trying to get xdelta to show me what's differing so I can see if there's a
pattern or something, but it's awful - data corruption not only possibly
but happening. :-)
I haven't tried remounting yet to see what I get, but I don't see the
problems on unpatched 2.4.2. I'll wait a bit to see if anyone has seen
this. Anyone?
Take care,
