Please use include/linux/pfn.h instead of defining these

How about we help you get sparsemem working properly, and you can kill
all of the discontigmem support from your arch?  You can be the first
non-legacy-impeded architecture. ;)
Feel free to mail Andy or myself with your compile errors, and I'm sure
we can iron it out.  I'd try myself, but I don't have a cross-compiler
for your arch yet.  Do you have one handy?
It would also be nice to see a _couple_ of patches that perhaps abstract
a thing or two into generic code.  I know that new architectures usually
begin with a 'cp -r', but it would be nice to see a wee bit of code
refactoring as a small price of admission.  Some of the ioremap and
other pagetable code looked pretty generic to me.
