The memory fault when setfcaps is run as noted in #4 below also occurs 
on RHEL5 IA64 (2.6.18 kernel-2.6.18-1.2747.el5 with Serge's capability patch,
and Kaigai's userspace tools installed).

| 1) replaced the ancient /lib/libcap.so.1.92 with less ancient libcap.so.1.10

| 2) successfully applied Serge's patch to SLES 2.6.18 sources and rebooted
