Integrating with the task balancer makes really only sense if the
device supports MSI-X and if it does that you don't really need
an irq balancer because you can just send to all CPUs as needed.
Without MSI-X you would be trying to reprogram the interrupts
all the time when a task is migrating and it is highly doubtful
that doing that automatically would do any good.
