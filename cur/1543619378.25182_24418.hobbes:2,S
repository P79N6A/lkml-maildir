I have to think about it.  I'm not convinced that this particular 
flavour of standardization is a step in the right direction -- in fact, 
it is *guaranteed* to provide significant additional complexity for 
bootloaders, and bzImage support is still going to have to be provided 
for the forseeable future.  Since you express that it will basically be 
necessary to stitch the ELF file together on the fly I don't see much 
point, quite frankly; it seems like extra complexity for no good reason.
