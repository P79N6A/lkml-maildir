Hi,
I made program that continously read /proc/net/arp and
watches mac address changes. This works pretty well, exept
that sometimes i get stale information, there is two
entryes for one ip. Looks like kernel updates information
while reading from proc.
I notised that this could happen when read buffer is too
small, but that was not case. 
I looked kernel source, and looks like in net/ipv4/arp.c
in function arp_run_bh there is no chekking for 
ARP_LOCKED() after arp_fast_lock(). There is cli(),
but that isnt enought?
