You're totally missing the point.
Again, for about the 3rd time:
The old system allowed DRIVERS to have a default font which may be different
depending on the individual DRIVER.  A driver may default to the Acorn font,
but you want to offer the user the other fonts.  This is possible in kernels
before 2.3.51.
With the new system in 2.3.51, the only way that this is possible is by
physically changing the kernel code and recompiling, since the default is
whichever font the kernel finds first.
Therefore, I conclude that we have lost functionality.
