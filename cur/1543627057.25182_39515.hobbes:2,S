Hi.
No, I doubt this has anything to do with Linux.   I have a S2460 (which his
corrected post says he has), which does not power down under linux, and
*never* warm boots cleanly.  It does power down under windows, so I assume
ACPI powerdown works and APM does not.  I have gone under the assumption that
a BIOS upgrade will fix this, but that involves putting a floppy into the box,
so I haven't done it yet.  The warm boot problems consist of either a hang
after POST (but before bootloader, OS irrelevent), or really bad video
corruption.  I don't know if it boot with the video corruption, I've never let
it try.
