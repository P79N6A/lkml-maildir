No. You can't splice more than the kernel buffers anyway (ie currently 
PIPE_BUFFERS pages, ie ~64kB, although in theory somebody could use large 
pages for it), so 64-bit would be total overkill.

Umm. More likely better to just do rw_verify_area() instead, which limits 
it to MAX_INT. Although it probably doesn't matter, for the above obvious 
reason anyway (ie we end up doing everything on a page-granular area 
anyway).

I don't see that being problematic. I agree that if "len" is in pages, we 
should call it something else (like 'npages'), but the fact that we 
commonly use "len" for byte-lengths just sounds sane.

flags are always unsigned long, haven't you noticed? Besides, they should 
never be signed, if you do bitmasks and shifting on them: "int" is 
strictly worse than "unsigned" when we're talking flags.

Right now "flags" doesn't do anything at all, and you should just pass in 
zero.
But if we ever do a "move" vs "copy" hint, we'll want something.

It's not unrelated. Note the new "page_count() == 1" test.

You think? What convention do we have? We don't say "cp dst src", we say 
"cp src dst".
The "destination first" convention is insane. It only makes sense for 
assignments, and these aren't assignments.

Why would it matter? If both are pipes, then one is as good as the other. 
You just want to pick the version that is potentially more efficient, if 
there is any difference (and there is).
However, I don't think Jens actually did the pipe->pipe case at all (ie 
pipes don't have the "splice_read()" function yet).

Some filesystems may not like having highpages. 
I suspect it should be "mapping_gfp_mask(mapping)".

You'd use it instead of "sendfile()".
Think of it as a hell of a lot more capable than "sendfile()" can ever be. 
It can take input from anything that just has "splice_read()", and move it 
to anything else, without doing any extra copies.
So imagine a streaming media thing, with a DVB card. Imaging wanting to 
push all that data around the system without doing a "read()" into user 
space and then a "write()" out to a file.
Also, imagine doing a "tee()" system call that can duplicate the pages 
from one pipe into two other pipes. By just incrementing the page count. 
So that your media streaming application can stream to both a file _and_ 
to live video (or whatever else) without doubling the buffering and doing 
memcpy.
