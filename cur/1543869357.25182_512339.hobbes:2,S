Ingo, some testing of the experimental syslet queueing stuff, in the
syslet-testing branch of fio.
Fio job file:
[global]
bs=8k
size=1g
direct=0
ioengine=syslet-rw
iodepth=32
rw=read
[file]
filename=/ramfs/testfile
Only changes between runs was changing ioengine and iodepth as indicated
in the table below.
Results:
Engine          Depth           Bw (MiB/sec)
--------------------------------------------
libaio            1             441
syslet            1             574
sync              1             589
libaio           32             613
syslet           32             681
Results are stable to within +/- 1MiB/sec. So you can see that syslet
are still a bit slower than sync for depth 1, but beats the pants off
libaio for equal depths. Note that this is buffered IO, I'll be out for
the weekend, but I'll hack some direct IO testing up next week to
compare "real" queuing.
Just a quick microbenchmark to gauge current overhead...
