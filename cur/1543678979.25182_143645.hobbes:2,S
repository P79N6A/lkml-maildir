Indeed.  I certainly hope that at some point we can share at least
parts of the code between the drivers.  I just haven't seen a good way
to do it yet.

Quite true.  I suspect we will never be able to cleanly merge the core
of the Rx and Tx paths.  With luck though, we'll be able to share code
for implementing the wireless extensions, some other support routines,
and maybe parts of initialization.
