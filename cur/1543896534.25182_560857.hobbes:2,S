Well, I'm using SuSE Pro 9.3 (excellent choice by the way), 
coming with kernel 2.6.10-SuSE, on a ATI laptop, and the 
drivers privided wouldn't compile (suspend & freinds). The 
SATA disks were only supported from 2.6.15 (which just came 
out), so I had to edit the "source code" of a closed source 
driver to make it all work well. If that's "easy" for you I 
doubt it is for 99.999% of earth's population. "World 
domination" is far away.
Also, the 7 National Instruments cards I'm using for a 
deformable mirror in Adaptive Optics in an industrial PC 
are "certified" for SuSE 9.3 only. Which, this week, got 
discontinued. So what now ?
