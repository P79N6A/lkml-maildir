Could you check the buddy allocator?
I think that the zoned buddy allocator aligns memory allocations
relative to the beginning of the zone, and not relative to the physical
address.
I.e. if a zone starts at 0x00001000, then an 8K allocation will be
unaligned. This could be a problem for CONFIG_DISCONTIG_MEM computers
[normal i386 zones start at 0, 16MB, 4GB --> no alignment problems]
