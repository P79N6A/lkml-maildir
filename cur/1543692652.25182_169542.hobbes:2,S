Hi, I have a Logitech Cordless Desktop with those funny extra buttons at the 
top. However, one particular button no longer works when running development 
kernels (it worked in 2.4 kernels). The first development kernel I tested 
with was 2.5.75; it hasn't worked from then up until 2.6.0-test6, which I am 
running now.
The key in question is labelled "Messenger / SMS". When tailing 
/var/log/kern.log, and I press the key in question, I get this (I switched on 
debug in i8042.c and atkbd.c in case it helped):
Sep 30 21:55:32 fastpc kernel: drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: e0 <- i8042 
(interrupt, kbd, 1) [187205]
Sep 30 21:55:32 fastpc kernel: atkbd.c: Received e0 flags 00

Sep 30 21:55:32 fastpc kernel: atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set

cat'ing /proc/bus/input/devices gave this for the keyboard
I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0001 Product=0002 Version=ab02
N: Name="AT Translated Set 2 keyboard"
P: Phys=isa0060/serio0/input0
H: Handlers=kbd evbug
B: EV=120003
B: KEY=4 2200000 c061f9 fbc9d621 efdfffdf ffefffff ffffffff fffffffe
B: LED=7
Is there anyway I can make this key work again?
Thanks for any help.
Paul
