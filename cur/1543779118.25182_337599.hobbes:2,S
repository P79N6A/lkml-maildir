So..  what does it all mean?  Did you hit sysrq-T in the middle of the
stall?  If so then the kernel seems to be happily running the udev startup
code.  It's a bit sucky - takes about half a minute here.
If the stall occurred before "VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem)." then I
suggest you also enable CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME and regenerate the dmesg output
so we can see exactly which initcall is stalling.
