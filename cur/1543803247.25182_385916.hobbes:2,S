IMHO there's not much point in allowing changes. I have a feeling that
might create icky issues you don't want to have to tackle when the
solution is easy by just not allowing it. Part of my thinking is that
different virtual types have different structures associated, so
changing it needs re-creating structures anyway. And different virtual
device types might even be provided by different kernel modules so you
don't carry around AP mode if you don't need it.

Right [global config targets wiphy]. I do think this is an important UI
issue that userspace will have to tackle, but I think the correct way
for the kernel is to surface this issue instead of creating workarounds.

I'm not sure this is worth it. While putting this into the WiPHY device
creates more logic there, putting knowledge like 'how many different
channels can this WiPHY device support' etc. into some representation
that can be used by the stack to decide is much more trouble than it is
worth.
