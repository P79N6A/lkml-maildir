For the record: It works around my problems with e100 and snd-intel8x0,
too.

The Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt says this about pci=routeirq:
"Do IRQ routing for all PCI devices. This is normally done in
pci_enable_device(), so this option is a temporary workaround for broken
drivers that don't call it."
Ie, it doesn't sound too bad to use it until the problem is solved.
And I don't know if this particular issue is a case of broken drivers,
but that was what the parameter was added to work around.
