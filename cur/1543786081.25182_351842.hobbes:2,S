I'm happy to discuss solutions given a clear use case what you want
to do, why you want to do it etc.

Ah - my code is better because my credentials are better. Maybe better than
maybe... I did only some tuning on large systems, but I spent quite some time 
tuning NUMA code on small NUMA systems. Also  I did spent a bit of time 
looking at some of the tools offered by other Unixes and it left the clear 
impression that they were far too complex and shouldn't be emulated in Linux.
The existing NUMA API was designed by keeping things relatively
simple (in fact my experience so far was that most users only
want to have the most simple of its policies - even the moderately
fancy stuff in there seems to  be rarely used) so I think the bar
for more NUMA policy should be set extremly high and everything
come with extremly good rationales.

Yes that was a lot of quite complicated code that seemed to me
quite overkill for its job.
Regarding swap: surely you know swapping doesn't necessarily
write to disk but first put stuff into the swap cache (we even
talked about that in Ottawa). So the plan would be to first
implement swapoff_process() that writes out to disk. And then
if someone really comes up with a clear case where this doesn't work
for them this can be extended to migrate directly out of the swap
cache missing the IO step.
