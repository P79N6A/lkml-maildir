relying on that is quite futile. E.g. in the block IO code it needed 3-4
iterations even after the first instance was found to get all the cases
right. There are functions that are always called from under a lock then
some unlocked call happens and we've got trouble. Often the bug is some
very rare and obscure corruption of a statistics value, nobody really
notices that.
by today i think we've identified most of the places that can safely do
smp_processor_id() in a preemptible section (in x86 and x64) - it's only
around 3% of the total smp_processor_id() use. I'd rather allow these
exceptions and flag new exceptions as they get added - they are added at
least an order of magnitude more rarely than smp_processor_id() gets
added.
