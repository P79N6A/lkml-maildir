Ok, I brought old Turbo Debugger from home...
It is not true on this box I type this message right now. 128 MB RAM.
Under DOS:
INT 15 AX=E801 returns carry set and AH=86 (have no BIOS manual here to look 
up this error code), other registers unchanged.
INT 15 AH=88 returns AX=0.
INT 15 AX=E820 - not tested, but obviously not working (or else kernels would 
boot fine without linld/loadlin kludge or kernel patch)
So we have "triple-0" failure extracting mem size info from INT 15.

Where do you propose to get memory size in this case?

You're right, DOS/Win won't boot.
Just imagine old lovely 486 box never tested by manufacturer to work well 
with 64 MB of RAM. Joe Random Hacker plays Meg-o-Rama, but BIOS does not 
understand how that can be: int 15 fn 88 does not fit in 16-bit reg?!
DOS does not boot, Joe says: well, Linux rulez, it will boot! but no...
OTOH, CMOS reading hack most probably would not work either... memscan time?
