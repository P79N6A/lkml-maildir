I absolutely _detest_ patches that make already complex and unreadable 
code even more so. Especially conditionals. Please don't do that.
If you need a variable for a conditional, make it be an implicit one from 
an inline function, and aim for making it readable.
So how about instead writing it out as a nice self-explanatory inline 
function? I can almost guarantee that this generates no worse code, and it 
also makes it easy to explain things like "we don't bother with the lock, 
because we don't care enough".
Untested, but I think the point of the patch is obvious. Anybody want to 
test it, send it back to me, and fix the bug while making the code more 
readable?
I think we should instate a hard new rule:
 - if a bugfix doesn't make the code more readable, it's not a bugfix at 
   all.
There was a reason for the bug in the first place, and that reason is 
likely that the code was hard to think about. So making it even _harder_ 
to think about isn't really fixing the deeper problem!
