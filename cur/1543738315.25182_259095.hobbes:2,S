No, pci can not be a module.  Can your serio core be a module?  If not,
just make it global.  But if so, yes, EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() is the proper
marking.

Nice.  We want to make this kind of functionality avaiable to all
busses, and not have it be a bus only type feature.  So if you can see
any way it could be moved into the core, I'd be all for it.
