Description/why/what etc. missing.
<quick look>
This is all unconditionally called at context switch?!??
No way this can be merged. It needs to be zero cost for any process
that doesn't use perfmon and even for those it probably needs 
some tuning.
See my earlier mail on how to make it zero cost for i386/x86-64.
Please don't submit such horrible code again.
