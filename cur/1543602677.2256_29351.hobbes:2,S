Thaniks, all who replied.
A little clarification on my project:
I'm going to try to build a userland app that manages several different 
network profiles and watches the ethernet port and notifies the user of 
a disconnect. If the user wishes, it will be configured to unload the 
network profile upon disconnect (to avoid long timeouts) and upon 
reconnction, reload that profile. A few simple subnet detection 
algorithms would try to intelligently load the correct profile. This is 
mainly a useful solution for mobile users who have to have different 
set-ups for networking. It looks like the mii-diag from Becker is going 
to work great (thanks, all who pointed me there), and is the last 
component I needed to get started. I may put the project up on 
sourceforge as my coding skills are new and weak. Thanks for the info.
As a side note, any chance such monitoring tools/interfaces might go 
into a later 2.4 or 2.5 kernel and be available in the /proc fs? That 
would be a much more elegant solution, from a user's standpoint. Again, 
thanks, all!
Cheers,
Robert Cantu
