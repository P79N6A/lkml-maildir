The code around there looks relatively unbuggy to me.  Removing that
remove_wait_queue() would be very bad - it would cause later stack
corruption.
msleep_interruptible() certainly shouldn't consume CPU like that.  Do we
know where the CPU time is being spent?  The output of:
readprofile -r
sleep 10
readprofile -n -v -m /boot/System.map | sort -n -k 3 | tail -40
would tell us.
