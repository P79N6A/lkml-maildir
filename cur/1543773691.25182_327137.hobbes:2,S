Peter,
	I am experiencing exactly the same problem. I am using an ASUS
K8N-DL MB with the x86_64 kernel. My PCIX devices are not allocated
correctly. I tried using the  'pci=routeirq' option to no avail. Disabling
ACPI in the BIOS does not help the situation either. X will not use my PCIX
for GLX since none of the  extra txture memory has been allocated! Anyone
have any ideas?
regards,
Brian

Hi Ivan,
I've just tried a recent pull from Linus post 2.6.12. It seems that the 
bar sizes are now (mostly) correct. However, there are still issues with 
the resources failing to be allocated and the bars being disabled. I've 
attached the latest dmesg and lspci -vvx to see whether there's any 
enlightenment out there...
thanks,
peter
