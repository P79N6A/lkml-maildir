[I'm the guy who wrote the doc]
I didn't write "It could possibly be ready as soon as 2.6.19" literally,
that was someone that reworked my (ugly) english. Being fair what make
me wrote that pages was the huge amount of people FUDing about linux
developers in online forums (including this list)

Hans, stop that "we're smarter than you" attitude. It's not surprising
that reiser 4 creates so many flames and that it's getting so hard to make
progress, with such strong arguments. As far as I can tell, most of the
kernel hackers trust Al Viro and hch on their opinions, specially in
fs-related issues - and for good reasons. They know linux and they 
know how a linux fs must behave. As long as a fs plays well with the
rest of the system and the code doesn't suck, I doubt they care too
much if it's very advanced or arcane, and the huge variety of
filesystem available in linux confirms that.

Hans, I don't agree. If anything, the problem is that right now there's
not a "development" stage: people just takes more care about what goes
in, it wouldn't happen the same under a development stage. That certainly
could make the job of big projects like reiser 4 much harder.
