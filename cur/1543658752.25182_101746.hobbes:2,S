Your last sentence there is telling.  Hurd is both GNU and Linux, yet you
don't seem to be interested in giving credit where credit is due.  If you
can't do that, you don't have any credibility left.

I would expect that both GNU code and Linux make up smaller fractions
of current GNU/Linux distros, because so many other programs have been
added over the years.  It's a good thing that so many free programs
have been developed, and that so many people have contributed, but
this doesn't change the system's history.  It started out as the
combination of GNU and Linux.
