Some time ago I sent a patch doing this only on */fs/* [not the filesystem's
code, just the common stuff]. It was dismissed by Linus under
I-don't-know-what
-the-hell-reasons (it's very smart to dismiss something without reason,
gives
the original poster a very clear idea of what needs to be changed -
nevermind,
just being ironic). 
However, I'd suggest to post this into the Kernel Janitors mailing list and
let one of the big guys there swipe it in.
Maybe Robert Love can provide more highlight.
