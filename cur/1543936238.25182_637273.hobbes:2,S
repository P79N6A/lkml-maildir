argh, Jens. Really. I believe you stopped using your brain because 
CONFIG_BKL_IO_TRACE=y is affected by this bug and apparently you've got 
a weak spot for it ;)
Think about it another way then, in the context of another, real kernel 
feature we introduced in v2.6.24, namely CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y:
- Fact: feature CONFIG_CPU_IDLE=y did not exist in 64-bit x86 in v2.6.23.
  It has known bugs but they are not flagged 'regressions' (because the 
  feature did not exist before and the option is default-disabled) hence 
  the feature can stay. Some fixes to it are too dangerous or too 
  unproven and are delayed to v2.6.25.
and now apply the same rule to CONFIG_NO_HZ:
- Fact: feature CONFIG_NO_HZ=y did not exist in 64-bit x86 in v2.6.23.
  It has known bugs but they are not flagged 'regressions' (because the 
  feature did not exist before and the option is default-disabled) hence 
  the feature can stay. Some fixes to it are too dangerous or too 
  unproven and are delayed to v2.6.25.
ok?
Yes, it's bad that this happened, and perhaps it _is_ a regression, but 
not for the reason you claim. [ It might be a regression if 32-bit 
blktrace has the same problem under NO_HZ for example _AND_ bkltrace 
worked perfectly on the same box on v2.6.23. ]
Kernel regressions have a _strict_ definition: they mean "anything that 
worked before will work in the future too". Not: "anything that worked 
before will work in the future too if you enable random new non-default 
kernel features".
[ If the latter was the criterium we'd probably never see new features
  integrated! New stuff has bugs, because it's not nearly as well-tested 
  as older stuff. What matters is to 1) not turn it on by default if it 
  has known bugs 2) to always make positive progress on it, i.e.: to not
  regress new features in future kernel releases. This way, in the ideal 
  case, we'll have a monotonic series towards a perfect, bug-free kernel 
  ;) ]

fantastic! :)

compared to the costs of IO transfers it should be OK. It can be really 
fast but in the worst-case it can be as slow as 3-6 usecs (when we use 
the acpi_pm clocksource). If there's complaints then probably the 
networking folks will yell first :)
