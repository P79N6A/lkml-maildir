This used to work before, it was just undocumented.
Do a 
	#define O_NONE	3
and see if it still works.. I suspect it does - I was careful to have
open() change the flags by doing something like
	flags = (flags + 1) & 3;
which turns the O_ACCMODE bits into two nice bits (bit #0 is "readable"
and bit #1 is "writable" instead of the standard O_ACCMODE braindamage).
