Yes. But this is not the best solution, if I can add on to the example
and make some assumptions.
Imagine that most of the program's memory is on node 1, it was scheduled
on node 2 cpu 8 momentarily (maybe because kswapd ran on node 1, other
higher priority processes took over other cpus on node 1, etc). 
Then, your patch will try to keep the process on node 2, which is not
neccessarily the best solution. Of course, as I mentioned before, if
you have a node local cache on node 2, that cache might have been warmed
enough to make scheduling on node 2 a good option. 
I am not saying there is a wrong or right answer, there are so many
possibilities, everything probably works and breaks under different
circumstances. 
Btw, while we are swapping patches, the patch at
	
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/numa/download/sched242.patch
tries to implement per-arch scheduling. The current scheduler behavior
is smp_arch_goodness() and smp_pick_cpu(), but the patch allows the
possibility for a specific platform to change that to something else. 
Linus has seen this patch, and agrees to it in principle. He does not
consider this 2.4 material though. Of course, I am completely open to
Ingo (or someone else) coming up with a different way of providing the
same freedom to arch specific code.
