     Yes.  I noticed that it is tainted by the touch of Lotus Notes..
     My opinnions re that product are not great, but with its email
     functions I know only about problems occurring with it.
     ( I _do_ have skewed world-view, postmaster collects errors! )
     It may be great system for what it was/is originally built for,
     but connection with the Internet Email might not be it in the
     _general_ case.  Not even now, years after those interfaces have
     been pioneered, and should have been debugged throughout.
     It might even be a pilot error at the admin chair.
     That thing does apparently still exhibit what I call "LAN EMAIL"
     mentality:   If there occurs some problem, thing with it goes and
     scans visible headers for possible addresses, and blasts all those
     with its cry.  The correct address is of course the SMTP-level
     transport MAIL FROM address,  and in case of virus scanners,
     perhaps also the RCPT TO recipients.
