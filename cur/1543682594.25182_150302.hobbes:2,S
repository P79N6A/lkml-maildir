Hi all,
I compiled kernel version 2.5.75, before I had kernel 2.4.20, the problem is
that I need to enable SCSI DC395x, but when I execute lsmod I not found
neither modules loaded, only appear:
Module                  Size  Used by
If I mount manually a module (insmod
/lib/modules/2.5.75/kernel/drivers/scsi/dc395x.ko) the following message
appear: Error inserting
'/lib/modules/2.5.75/kernel/drivers/scsi/dc395x.ko': -1 Unknown symbol in
module, I have my modules.conf in the directory /lib/modules/2.5.75/ but
this kernel no load automatically the modules.
I need to load this module because Ineed to use the tape backup, I have a
backu that I need urgent.
How can I do it?
Thanks,
