You could definitely use procfs, but it sounds like your example would
be complex.  Lately mounting filesystems has become a cheap operation in
Linux.  Mount/umount is also a convenient synchronization point.  So,
maybe consider implementing your own tiny filesystems - a data
filesystem, where you mmap(2)/read(2)/write(2) data values, and a
control filesystem, where you control the system and manipulate data
values.
That way, you can use standard Unix syscalls, standard Unix tools and
standard Unix permissions to accomplish your domain-specific task.
