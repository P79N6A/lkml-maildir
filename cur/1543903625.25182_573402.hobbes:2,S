The problem is that gcc is too eager to align stuff to some big power of two
upon reaching some irrelevant threshold. Why structures 32 bytes and more
in size should be aligned to 32 bytes (even if they have no doubles
and thus are not planned to be used by SSE code) is beyond me.
Why string literals of 32+ bytes are aligned is (beyond me)^2.
These are reverted in latest gcc (for -Os only):
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31319
but meanwhile gcc started to align stack to 16 bytes, *unconditionally*:
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32849
I imagine 4K stack people will especially like it.
Apart from being bloaty, this also broke de-facto i386 ABI.
There is a solution which isnt bloaty and doesn't break the ABI.
But it wasn't chosen. :(
