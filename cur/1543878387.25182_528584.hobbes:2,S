It's not just MSI - I recently managed to put a Dell Latitude D820 into its bag
while still running, where it babbled to itself running on the warm side for
several hours.  When I finally did get it out, it *was* quite hot to the touch,
but I was amazed that it managed to run the battery down to somewhere under 4%
(which took some 4 or 5 hours) and then throw the thermal check that made it
shut down - quite the coincidence indeed.
However, "ran warm but tolerable and then used the thermal to shut down when
the battery failed" matches the symptoms much better....
