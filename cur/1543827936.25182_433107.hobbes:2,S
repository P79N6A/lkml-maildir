I'm not particularly sympathetic to out of tree implementations,
especially one which is as (NOT!) likely to be merged as STREAMS
support.  Out of tree patches can always patch struct inode to add all
the bloat they want.  Also, it souinds like you're not usually using
i_pipe as a true pointer to a struct pipe_inode_info, but rather as
kludged location to stash your v_str pointer.  Why not just have your
STREAMS implementation patch include/linux/fs.h to add a v_str pointer?
