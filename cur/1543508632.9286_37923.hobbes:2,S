If people are going to implement this, I think that it would be good if
there was an API writeup first.  I would like to implement something similar
in FreeBSD and I think that it would be nice to see both implementations
have the same API and effects.
It may take longer the get this thing going, but I think that it would
be well worth it to get input from the FreeBSD camp, too.  I'm sure somebody
over there heard the usenix paper.
