Oh, that's not pretty.  It means that the sequencer (or possibly the
bus) was wedged as it exited domain validation and it won't even recover
if we drop down to fully async.
What type of array is this, by the way?  I don't recognise the vendor.
But anyway, let's proceed on the theory that the array is having a hard
time.  What I need you to do is lower the speed of the array target in
the aic bios.  Unfortunately, the driver won't honour that setting at
the moment:  I'll see if I can work up the code that will do it.  The
attached patch will perform this artificially (for every device on every
aic79xx).
