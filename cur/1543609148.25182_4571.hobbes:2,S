My guess would be that you built the kernel without any support for
nfsd, even as a module.  And then tried to build nfsd as a module
afterwards.
Unfortunately this doesn't work.
I suggest that you rebuild the kernel again with CONFIG_NFSD set to M,
and the build the modules.  I'm sure they will link then.
