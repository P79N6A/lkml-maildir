Make an empty map for little-endian direct access and make a backing map
with the actual file. Then install a signal handler to catch reads in the
empty map, copy a page (or more) with byteswapping, and you're done.
"Loading" is still extremely fast. 
As David Miller suggests, this might be a complete non-issue. We can for
instance speculate that the processor has a byteswap micro-op that can be
added to an instruction pipeline with little or no cost. Or other such
magic. Remember, we're talking about a fairly novel architecture.
