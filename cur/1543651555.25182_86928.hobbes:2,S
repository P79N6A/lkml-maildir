The patches don't seem to have wended their way back to mainline
yet, probably because people have been concentrating on 2.5 recently.
I think Andrea's -aa kernel has fixes for most, if not all of these
problems.

rmap won't help you in this instance, as the stuff you're filling
ZONE_NORMAL with is unswappable. In fact, it may make it worse,
due the overhead of pte_chains ... but this will probably only
hurt you if you have many large tasks sharing memory.
Changing PAGE_OFFSET from 3Gb to 2Gb may be a better workaround than
decreasing from 4Gb to 2Gb of RAM, if you don't have any huge single
process.
