No, that code will only kick in if your MUX gets confused and not during
normal course of operation. Some MUXes, when confused, raise MUXERR flag
but leave the data byte intact in violation of active multiplexing spec.
which says that with MUXERR the only valid data bytes are 0xfd, oxfe and
0xff (to signal timeout, resend or parity error). So if we get something
other than 0xfd, 0xfe or 0xff within HZ/10 of last successfully transmitted
byte we assume that MUX got confused and the byte was sent by the same
device that transmitted the previous byte.
Does it make any sense?
