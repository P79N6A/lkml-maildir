If Mandrake used LILO to install, there very well might be a backup in
/boot/boot.0800 or something like that.  You might want to consult the
LILO documentation and/or a net search to see if they say how to restore
this (probably using dd).
If you have real W2K media, it has boot floppies and a CD.  You can boot
from floppy to access the CD, and then run recovery mode.  It might be
able to fix this up.  Then again, it might demand that you had made an
emergency recovery disk from within W2K, something I learned the hard
way once.
