Subject: [PATCH 2.6] Number of proc entries based on NR_CPUS ?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/11/8/39

Here is a patch that makes the number of /proc entries be based on
NR_CPUS instead of just having a fixed number.  I think it is a good
idea now that big Linux machines are starting to appear.
The proper constant and slope of increase are up for argument too.
Patch is against the latest linux-2.5 bk tree.
Opinions?
