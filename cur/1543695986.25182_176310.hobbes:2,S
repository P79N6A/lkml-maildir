Not a clue. Gave up on NFS when nothing had changed in -test4 and -test5
(the first regression). This weekend I spent compiling to find the
'readahead' values. Am on a PII 400, so takes time to nail specifics.
Can't do another marathon compile until next weekend.

Am rather clueless when it comes to networking. You have to deduce from
the following. Remote is a Pentium 120 with Slackware 7.1.0 (Universal
NFS Server 2.2beta47) kernel 2.2.16. Does it even speak TCP? I compiled
this -test9 with TCP only when I saw the 29 minutes - and no change
afterwards. Looks like I'm using UDP, or?

On this -test9 it is an integrated NIC which needs the de4x5 (Compaq
Presario 5640). When trying out Slackware 9.something it was
autodetected as a tulip but didn't work with that driver. The P120 uses
an ISA card driven by a cs89x0 module.

Kernels are compiled without everything in that area. Not even the older
power management is compiled in.

As I said, clueless about networking. So I'll have to use the weekend
for more info-gathering.
