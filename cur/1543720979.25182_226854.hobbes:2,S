Right.  But I think it would be desirable to do other things -- for 
example, a program might want to forward one token over to a daemon to do 
some work.  It doesn't make much sense here to have a hierarchial structure.
BTW, does AFS even have this hierarchy, or does pagsh just create a copy? 
I can't find any manpage for it...
