Amit, I think we've got a bug on i386 then.  Looking at i386-lite.patch,
there's:
+void kgdb_correct_hw_break(void)
+int kgdb_remove_hw_break(unsigned long addr, int type)
+int kgdb_set_hw_break(unsigned long addr, int type)
+int remove_hw_break(unsigned breakno)
+int set_hw_break(unsigned breakno, unsigned type, unsigned len, unsigned addr)
Of these, only kgdb_correct_hw_break is called in core-lite.patch, and
set_hw_break/remove_hw_break (for y/Y packets) are called in
i386-lite.patch.
What I think we need to do is, since y/Y packets are reserved, I'm
assuming there's a special version of GDB using these for hw
breakpoints, and this needs to be handled in i386-lite.patch.
Since core-lite's handling of a z/Z* packet is to assume setting a
breakpoint, and hw or sw is controlled by the KGDB_HW_BREAKPOINT flag,
we need to make sure this (a) works and (b) is actually calling useful
functions.
