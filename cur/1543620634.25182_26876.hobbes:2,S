A new version of the AMD Elan patch is available on
  
http://www.pengutronix.de/software/elan_en.html
This patch against 2.4.18-pre9 - as the last ones as well - consists only
of a bugfix for the serial driver. All other stuff has been merged into
the mainstream kernel so far. The implementation of the fix has been
changed according to a suggestion by Theodore Ts'o in this revision.
If you have an AMD Elan processor (SC400, SC410, SC520) please test this
fix extensively and send me bug reports. You might also want to test it if
you don't have this special hardware, as the patch now does also affect
the normal serial driver.
On my todo list is the fix for the /proc/ioports resources which is
currently not part of the patch as well as a cpufreq driver.
Robert
