I've used 2.4.18 extensively on an Intel 486 SX-25, without problems.
I did notice the immediate rebooting problem using a few old 2.5.x
trees, but that was months ago, around the 2.5.40 timeframe, more
recent 2.5.x trees worked fine.
Incidently, I haven't had time to do my usual testing on low spec
machines recently, but intend restart that at the earliest
opportunity.
John.
