I think I'm seeing the same VM behavior with NFS/ext3 that was described 
with fuse.
I have a shared storage unit with 2 servers.  The local filesystem is 
ext3 and I'm failing
the ext3 mounting and NFS serving from one node to another.  I'm running 
I/O on the NFS
mount point to the active server.   If I failover to the server that is 
also executing the I/O,
I can hang the machine.  Looking at the stack traces, the NFS writes are 
stuck in
balance_dirty_pages().  NFS start up is causing rpc.mountd to write to 
the local
ext3 filesystem, but it gets blocked in balance_dirty_pages() too.  
Deadlock.  Without
the NFS server successfully started, the kernel can't write the dirty pages.
I'm running a 2.6.9-42 RH kernel.  Early in my debugging, I had tried 
several kernel
versions.  All 2.6 kernels saw this behavior and the 2.4 kernel I tried 
did not.
