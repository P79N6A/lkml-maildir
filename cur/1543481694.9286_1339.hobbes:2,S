Very nice, but sadly nonportable.  Sounds like we need an all-Unix
conference to hash out an acceptable common solution, unless the majority
really, really loves writing #ifdef s.

VMS calls these ASTs, and every I/O function that could block accepts one.
This lets the application programmer definitively answer the question of
what to do with this I/O completion, instead of making the kernel guess.
It's a model I've come to appreciate, and if you'd rather be synchronous
you can call the blocking version (functionW() rather than function() )
instead.  But the price of this is that I/O had to be designed as
fundamentally asynchronous, and a synchronizing mechanism had to be
provided for the less-critical but more numerous cases where you want to
block.
But this would require revamping much of the fundamentals of the I/O code,
and the result would be so un-Unixy that I don't expect to see it in Linux
anytime soon.  Possibly the time would be better spent building a whole
new kernel that doesn't attempt to be Unix-alike, and go off in a
different direction.

With ASTs you quickly learn to do as little as possible, like marking a
buffer reusable or moving it to another linked list, and letting the main
line do the heavy work.  (I/O rundown gives the issuing process a priority
boost, so setting a flag and waking the mainline code gives pretty good
response, and if it's already running then there's no penalty.)  Of course
there are exceptions.
And you're right -- it requires at least some support from the kernel.  
Making sync. I/O appear to be async. is much more difficult in userspace
than the other way 'round.  It's a question of keeping decisions close to
the information required to make them.  The kernel knows best what the
devices are doing, and the application knows best what *it* is doing with
the results.

just one more silly change to cope with.
