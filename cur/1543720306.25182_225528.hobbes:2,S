Less contrived example -- T2 locks file F2.  We report deadlock here too,
even though T1 is about to unlock file F1.
I pointed this out over a year ago when NPTL first went in and nobody
seemed interested in having the discussion then.  All I got was a private
reply from Andi Kleen suggesting that we shouldn't remove it.

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
