Subject: Input device support - twisted mouse wheel scrolling

I'm using the linux 2.5.5-dj1 and have a IMPS/2 mouse.
Since I've enabled input core support and changed the device name
( /dev/psaux --> /dev/input/mouse0 ) the mouse wheel
is scrolling the other way around. (I'm using KDE cvs)
A workaround is to change the ZAxisMapping option in XF86Config
from "4 5" to "5 4".
