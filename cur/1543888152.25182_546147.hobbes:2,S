    I'm not sure if this is my problem, since the external USB disks
seem to be at least as fast as the internal one (I've not noticed the
device to be slow at all). I'm going to use the same sets of disks in
another system that doesn't have an old VIA chipset, to see if the
problem is the PCI-fill one.
    BTW, using "sync" mount option doesn't help: it just makes the data
copying slower, but when the data is burst-written, the internal hard
disk stalls for a bit. The stalls are shorter, though.

    Probably the "dirty_ratio" setting will help, I'm going to test it
this weekend. I don't know if there are a per-device setting to tell how
many pages can be used as cache.
    Thanks for answering :)
