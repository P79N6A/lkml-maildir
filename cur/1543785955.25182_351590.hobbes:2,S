For the benefit of those of us who are interested in the problem, but aren't
in the mood to wade through a long standard looking for the answer to a
specific question, can you elaborate?
It isn't as obvious as all that, because of all the nasty corner cases...

Given a file "a.txt" that's pure ASCII, and a file "b.txt" that has the BOM
marker on it, what happens when you do "cat a.txt b.txt > c.txt"?
'cat' doesn't know, and has no way of knowing, that c.txt needs a BOM at the
*front* of the file until it's already written past the point in c.txt where
the BOM has to go.
What does the Unicode standard say to do in this case?
