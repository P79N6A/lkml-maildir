Looks like you may be onto something Pavel, has not invoked the OOM killer 
yet using mem=700M, I see the swap increasing and the speed of the copy is 
only 14-15MB/s, when mem= is off (giving me all memory w/preempt) I get 
45-65MB/s.
With append="mem=700M", seen below:

Almost there, looks like its going to make it.

Hrmm, with preempt off it works and with preempt ON and mem=700M it works.
I guess I will run with preempt off as I'd prefer to have the memory 
available-- and tolerate the large lag bursts w/ no preemption.
Yup it worked.
