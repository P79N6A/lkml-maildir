In many cases these drives with the older firmware don't even grace you 
with the benefit of an IDE error; they just give random file system 
corruption.  I believe that this was the cause of the problems I was 
reporting here:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2003-14/0935.html
after updating the firmware both systems seem to be OK.
So even if you aren't actually seeing these errors, even if you aren't 
using RAID I'd suggest getting this patch.
