Just a note: I booted 2.2.3-SMP on UP and suddenly my PS/2 mouse
buttons were completely dead. Restarting X cured the problem.
With 2.2.2-UP still no problem. I'll try 2.2.3ac1 soon to check
if the other troulbes(including some very bad nfs related errors)
I was experiencing with 2.2.3-SMP-on-UP come back with 2.2.3-UP.
