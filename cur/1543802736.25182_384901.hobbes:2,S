Johannes Berg told me he wants to use the fn key alone to switch the
keyboard layout or something. For such uses, the pb_enablefn is there.
pb_fkeyslast is to emulate the behaviour of KBDMode from pbbuttonsd.
The last one, pb_disablekeypad could left out. It doesn't add much code
and might be used by some people, too.
