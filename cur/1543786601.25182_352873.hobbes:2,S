hm, I wouldn't use it.  The problem is that a _lot_ of patches in -mm don't
fscking compile.
	bix:/usr/src/25> grep '[-]fix.patch' series | wc
	     72      72    2905
If your bisection happens to land you between foo.patch and foo-fix.patch,
you have a *known bad* kernel.   What's the point in testing it?
So I'd recommend the smarter approach: copy the series file to ~/hunt, edit
~/hunt and do the bisection by hand, marking the good and bad points in
~/hunt as you go.
