Update, X-Posted to lkml too, I followed the US link from the
TW site, and it had different versions of these files. I stuck
the 2 newest ones from the US site on a floppy and it all worked.
Now I have from "lspci -vvv|grep -A10 Ethernet" which I think is
the same as the previous listing:
00:04.0 Ethernet controller: nVidia Corporation nForce2 Ethernet Controller (rev a1)
        Subsystem: Biostar Microtech Int'l Corp: Unknown device 2301
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap+ 66Mhz+ UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=fast >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Latency: 0 (250ns min, 5000ns max)
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 11
        Region 0: Memory at dc005000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Region 1: I/O ports at c400 [size=8]
        Capabilities: [44] Power Management version 2
                Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1+ D2+ AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0+,D1+,D2+,D3hot+,D3cold+)
                Status: D0 PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-
However, this, nor the xconfig helps, still don't indicate which
driver I should be using, or where to get it if its not in the
kernel's tree yet a/o 2.6.8-rc2.  So thats the next piece of data I need.
And I haven't attempted to dismantle it to see the MAC address yet.
At nearly 70, sitting tailor fashion on the floor for extended periods
isn't nearly as comfortable as it once was :-)  Which is what that
dismantle will require, the tower its in is trapped under a homemade
desk by some steel bracing I put in when I made it 15 years ago...
But, one could probably rebuild a nearly half ton mopar 392 hemi-head
on it too :-)
