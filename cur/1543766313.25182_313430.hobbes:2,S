I have a similar problem.
I have a HP NC6000. It uses the Yenta PCMCIA kernel driver.
If I insert a PCMCIA card that uses cardmgr, it all works fine.
If I insert a Cardbus PCMCIA card it instead shows up as a PCI card, and
cardmgr does not even see it.
Now, here is the real problem. I can activate the card, and read PCI
information from it, but as soon as I do something like this:
value = inb(port);
I.e. The first inb/inw/inl command that the driver tries to do, locks up
the PC.
Does anyone have any ideas how to fix this?
