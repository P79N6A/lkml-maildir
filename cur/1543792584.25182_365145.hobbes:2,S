Subject: [PATCH 1/2] i386: double fault adjustment - introduce THREAD_ORDER
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This introduces THREAD_ORDER (to accompany THREAD_SIZE, which now
becomes a derivate of the former) in order to easily pass this to page
allocation routines. Code consuming this (fixing the double fault
handler to use per-CPU stacks) will soon follow.
