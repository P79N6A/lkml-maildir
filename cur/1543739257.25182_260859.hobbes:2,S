Being preempted by hard interrupts is sort of the point of moving the 
stuff to a tasklet. Just as long as other tasklets and user space cannot 
preempt it.
Are there any concerns when it comes to locking and tasklets? I've tried 
finding kernel-locking-HOWTO referenced in kernel-docs.txt but the link 
is dead and I can't find a mirror.
