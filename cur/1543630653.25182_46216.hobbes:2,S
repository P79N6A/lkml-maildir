I assume that should be:

>          /* see namei.c, msdos_format_name */

The comment from msdos/namei.c reads:
  /*  0xE5 is legal as a first character, but we must substitute 0x05     */
  /*  because 0xE5 marks deleted files.  Yes, DOS really does this.       */
  /*  It seems that Microsoft hacked DOS to support non-US characters     */
  /*  after the 0xE5 character was already in use to mark deleted files.  */
A question for the long-time kernel developers who are kind enough to
spend time on a question such as this:
Should the code:
>         for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) work[i] = de->name[i];
Be written as some sort of memcpy()? I would expect the inlined
version to do two 32-bit copies, or one 64-bit copy operation for
64-bit platforms for the above piece of code. Is much of the code
written as the above? Or is effort made to try and inline it
in some better architecture-specific way?
