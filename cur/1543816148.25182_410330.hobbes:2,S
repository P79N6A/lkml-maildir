> Beeuh. These macros don't really help. They actually make the lines
longer! I'm not taking this change, sorry.
If I kill off the macros but continue to use C99 structure initializers,
which is I believe is the proper kernel coding style today, the lines are
going to get even longer.  Is that OK?
Or are you asking for the patch w/o macros and w/o C99 structure
initializers?
I can/will do either.  Just let me know what is acceptable a priori.
