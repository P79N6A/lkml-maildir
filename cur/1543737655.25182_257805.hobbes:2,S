Yup, that's how it has to be done at present.
Another weirdness I ran into at one point, was that the mid-layer
could be made to segfault if a LLD asked it to remove a drive that
had previously been set "offline" -- it complains about an illegal
state transition during the removal, and then dies.  This sequence
no longer occurs in the QStor driver, but it might resurface soon
as more drivers begin to support hot insertion/removal.
