	Because those licenses are compatible, it is possible to distribute those
compatible pieces under the GPL, thus making it a 'GPL kernel (software
system)'. If it's compatible with the GPL license, it's compatible with the
reiserfs license.
	As soon as you take something under the FreeBSD license and combine it with
something under the GPL license, the entire thing is then under the GPL
license. So there is no problem here.

	This proprietary fork is either capable of being licensed under the GPL, or
it is not. In the first case, both a straight GPL license and the Reiserfs
license would allow the combination. In the second case, neither would.

	Now you lost me. What license is "the license"?
	Hans is simply clarifying the GPL's terms briefly and stating what
exceptions he is willing to offer.
