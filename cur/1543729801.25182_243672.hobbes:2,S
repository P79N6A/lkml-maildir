It's not the PF_* state of the caller who submitted the IO that matters,
though --- it's the state of all threads _waiting_ on the IO, which may
be different, and which can change even after the IO has begun.  
Eg. kswapd does a writepage, the writepage needs to allocate disk space,
and in doing so tries to access a metadata block which is already
undergoing IO from a different thread altogether.
