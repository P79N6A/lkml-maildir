But using schedule_timeout is not a bug. Userspace timeouts are always
defined to be "at least".

Well that's nice, but I have a bugfix here which probably needs to
get backported to stable kernels and distro kernels.
It should be just as easy to rebase the hrtimer patch on top of my
fix. Considering that you've had it for a year, I don't think it 
needs to be added right before my fix.

People ignore LTP test failures, and programs probably try to avoid
exercising the nuances of the unix signal API, I guess.
