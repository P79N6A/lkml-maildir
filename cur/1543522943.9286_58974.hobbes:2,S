Jens Axboe has a patch for it on www.kernel.dk. His current DVD-CD-ROM patch
fixes most of the problem by using something like a flag. According to my
experience it is working pretty well - if you format the whole disk. As soon
as you partition it and try format the partion the whole system becomes 
unstable. I have tried to figure what it does then but it will take me a while
to really trace this remaining problem.
