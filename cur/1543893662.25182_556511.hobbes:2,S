Subject: PATCH: fix mismatch between usb-hid.c HUT find/search mapping and the HUT reference doc

Hi all,
As some of you might know from my earlier post/thread about atkbd and softraw, 
I'm currently working on getting keyboards with internet/easy access keys to 
work painlessly / plug and play.
In order to be able to better test / develop this I've bought 2 cheap such 
keyboards today, one ps2 and one both usb and ps2 capable.
When comparing usb vs ps2 / testing the keycodes generated for the easy access
keys on my trust (microsoft compatible) keyboard. I noticed the search key
generated the linux/input keycode for find when connected through USB. This 
lead me to check the consumer page mappings in hid-input.c . And it turns out 
the the mapping for ID 0x221 deviates from the HUT standard document:
http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/Hut1_12.pdf
Currently it is incorrectly mapped to find, whereas it should be mapped to
search. I also added missing bindings for ID 0x21f, the real find and for
0x222, goto.
Regards,
Hans
