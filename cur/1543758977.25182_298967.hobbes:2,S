Strange enough, softlockup produces no additional output. Kernel just 
prints "acpi_power_off called" and freezes. Without softlockup detection 
compiled in it turns off normally.
First I was under impression that this is caused by 
acpi_power_off-bug-fix.patch mentioned above, but unfortunately removing 
it didn't actually solve the problem. Later I found I missed that 
softlockup detection sneaked in turned on by default, and disabling it 
made power off work again.
Power down via APM produced some softlockup output, but I am not sure if 
APM actually worked on my machine before - I just tried APM if it works 
when ACPI doesn't, and didn't bother taking a snapshot. I can recompile 
an APM kernel with softlockup enabled and disabled and test it, if it 
could help.
