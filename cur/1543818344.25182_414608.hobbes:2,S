Basically anything that should move to klibc I favor using
utsname() for.  That tends to make it clear it follows
the usual user space rules.
With a little luck HPA might actually have this code deleted
in -mm before we get to far.

I have not traced that path recently.  So I don't remember.
This is one of those odd cases that makes a real difference.
This reminds me of another piece of the conversation.
kernel_thread vs. kthread, and the oddities of daemonize.
In general user space cannot kill kernel threads, so having
a kernel thread inside a namespace is dangerous because it
means the namespace can never exit.
There are two ways to avoid the associated problems.
- modify daemonize to always use the instance of that
  namespace associated with init_task.
- modify all interesting kernel threads to use the
  kthread api instead of kernel_thread.  Using kthread
  makes the kernel threads children of keventd and always
  in the initial namespace instance.  As such we know
  we aren't inside of any user space namespace instance.
