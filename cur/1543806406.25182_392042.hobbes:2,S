Again, the patch removes a preempt_enable() and doesn't add a
preempt_disable().  Maybe this is to balance the earlier patch.  If so,
they should both be in the same patch so the kernel works OK at each stage.
You didn't include a description of what this patch actually does.
After all the corrections I'm not terribly confident that the three patches
which I ended up with are correct.  Please check them carefully.
