I like the current 2.5.x format. It gives a quick overview so I can choose 
which changesets interest me and I usually go into bk revtool afterwards 
and have a look at the actual code in the changesets of interest...
And I agree that the cut down 2.4.x changelog is not very useful... I 
always have to do a bk changes on the 2.4.x tree to get the full details.
Best regards,
