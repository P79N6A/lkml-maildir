Yes, of course.

Yes, I think it may be useful for non-signal-related traversals.
Currently we need tasklist_lock in order to use next_thread().
I beleive, we can migrate to rcu_read_lock+spinlock(sighand)
in most cases.
Well, next_thread() itself is safe already, but it can return
already zapped threads.
