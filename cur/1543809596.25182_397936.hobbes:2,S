Hi Dipankar
I believe your patch is good.
However there is a bug in get_empty_filp() :
if security_file_alloc(f) returns TRUE : The goto fail_sec;  is done and 
fail_sec: does a file_free(f)
This means an extra percpu_counter_mod(&nr_files, -1L); will be done.
So I think you must apply this patch too :
  fail_sec:
-	file_free(f);
+	kmem_cache_free(filp_cachep, f);
  fail:
  	return NULL;
(Ie no need for a delayed free done via rcu here, just a direct 
kmem_cache_free() call)
