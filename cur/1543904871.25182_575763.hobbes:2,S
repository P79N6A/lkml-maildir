Ah, sorry. do_wp_page() without page copy (reuse case) doesn't need sync.
About page copy case
There was an issue that Java receives SIGILL because lazy_mmu_prot_update()
is called before set_pte(). Then, Only do_wp_page() calls lazy_mmu_prot_update()
before set_pte().
This is because the kernel allocates a new page with filling its contents by
copy (on cache!) from old page.
Then, do_wp_page() uses page copy needs sync.

migration uses try_to_unmap() when removing old pte. so it seems safe.
This patch above treats creating new page map case.
