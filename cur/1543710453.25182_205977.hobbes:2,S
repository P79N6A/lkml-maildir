You'll need to bring the scanning priority back into the picture: don't
move mapped pages down onto the inactive list at low scanning priorities. 
And that eans retaining the remember-the-priority-from-last-time logic.
Otherwise it's inevitable that even a `cat monster_file > /dev/null' will
eventually swap out everything it can.

hm, that's left-over code which is pretty pointless now.
	if (page_test_and_clear_young(page))
		mark_page_accessed(page);
	if (TestClearPageReferenced(page))
		referenced++;
The pages in here are never on the LRU, so all the mark_page_accessed()
will do is to set PG_Referenced.  And we immediately clear it again.  So
the mark_page_accessed() can be replaced with referenced++.
