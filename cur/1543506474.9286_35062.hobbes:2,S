Someone braver than I could conceivably write a hugemem device driver
which would let you access this memory, put ramdisks on it, and even 
mmap segments of it.  (think solid state storage, except on the memory
bus instead of the SCSI bus)  That would probably get you most of the
benefit, with full compatibility with the current kernels.
