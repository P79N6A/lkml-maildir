Bleah, here's a one character patch to the current udev that makes
udevstart work properly with my symlink patch.
diff --git a/udevstart.c b/udevstart.c
index ce96f38..ce72b82 100644
--- a/udevstart.c
+++ b/udevstart.c
@@ -131,7 +131,7 @@ static int add_device(const char *devpat
 		setenv("UDEV_RUN", udev_run_str, 1);
 	dbg("add '%s'", devpath);
 
-	snprintf(path, sizeof(path), "%s%s", sysfs_path, devpath);
+	snprintf(path, sizeof(path), "%s%s/", sysfs_path, devpath);
 	path[sizeof(path)-1] = '\0';
 	class_dev = sysfs_open_class_device_path(path);
 	if (class_dev == NULL) {
So, any way we do it, users are going to have to upgrade udev to get
things to work properly.
But I guess we should use the symlink patch in the kernel too, just to
keep any other tools that don't have this kind of bug in them working
properly...
Opinions?
