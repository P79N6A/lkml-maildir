Subject: What's in linux1394-2.6.git?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Not much, and all of it is meant to be merged post 2.6.24.  The most
notable updates are fixes to firewire-ohci which fundamentally improve
isochronous reception via libdc1394 v2.
After these fixes, the most notable remaining issues with
drivers/firewire are:
  - difficulties to detect SBP-2 (storage) devices on some hosts
    (need to collect debug data for this ASAP),
  - DV reception broken on OHCI 1.0 variants of VIA VT630x,
  - IP over 1394 still not implemented/ ported.
So, distributors of kernel packages, be advised that the firewire
drivers are still not as functional as the classic ieee1394 driver
stack.  As always, more details on this are captured at
wiki.linux1394.org.
I will follow up to this post with two combo patches, reflecting the
merge queue for drivers/ieee1394 and drivers/firewire respectively,
because several of the patches have not been seen on lkml yet, only on
linux1394-devel.  All of the patches have been in -mm though (except for
a refresh of two small patches which happened after -rc8-mm1).
