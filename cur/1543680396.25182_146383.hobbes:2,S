On creating a proc entry, it's possible to set the data field to an
arbitrary pointer value.  Later, that pointer value can be used in
callbacks to do interesting things, like access persistent data
associated with the proc file.
I had to rewrite seq_read so that when it calls the start operation it
passes a pointer to a struct (not an loff_t) with iterator info and
also a pointer to the proc_dir_entry data field.
Would it be possible to modify seq_file to give easier access to the
data field of proc_dir_entry, or is seq_file too general for that to
be practical?
