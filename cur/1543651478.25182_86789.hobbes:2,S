kfree(NULL) is guaranteed to be OK and is a very common idiom.  Talk
to Linus about that - it's a religious issue and FWIW I'm on the same
side ("free(NULL) should be allowed").  IIRC, Linus had claimed quite
a few times that change of kfree() that would break kfree(NULL) would
be considered as a bug.
