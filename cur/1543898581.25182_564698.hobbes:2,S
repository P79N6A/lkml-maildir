These two and the ones like them were the ones I expected to see in
your dumps. So since you've discovered a way to get them functioning,
we can proceed with the debugging.

Here's your problem. CMD01 is a command that queries the cards for
their voltages. And the response is "no voltages". So either your host
driver is buggy, or your card is.
Have you tested with some other cards?
Also, the i.MX host driver is known to be a bit buggy. I would suggest
sending some questions out on the arm linux kernel mailing list as that
is where it's usually discussed.
