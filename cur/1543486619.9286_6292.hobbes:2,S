From the oops below, this looks suspiciously familiar. It happens because
NTFS tries to allocate some memory, fails, but doesn't check the return code.
That's fixed in 2.2.1-ac6, or I can send you the patch separately (it should
be in the linux-kernel archives as well). The fact that it runs out of memory
at all is the big problem, you should find that this goes away with the inode 
related fixes that are in 2.2.2-pre (and therefore presumably in Alan's
patches as well).

It's just debug -- I thought that was only printed if you compiled ntfs
with -DDEBUG, but obviously not. Don't worry about it :)
Did you ever see these problems with 2.1.131 and below? Just curious..
