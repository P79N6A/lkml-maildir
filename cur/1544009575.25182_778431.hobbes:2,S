James, please notice the first patch, it's about the mpt vendor
driver, the upstream device vendor maintained three series of mpt
drivers, specially for RHEL3,4,5/SLES8,9,10
but they didn't maintain one for the latest mainstream git kernel,
the first patch (130KB after bzip2'ed) is just replace
drivers/message/fusion/ with code "4.00.43.00" from vendor. You can
extracting the source from vendor into drivers/message/fusion/ instead
of applying this patch.

All the work in the second patch is just let it can build.
The vendor driver "4.00.43.00" is for RHEL5.1 (2.6.18-53.el5), and
cannot build on 2.6.26 and latest git kernel,
with applying the second patch, it can build. I have tested it, and
verified that it fixed the bug described on:

Yes, I have tried, but the vendor LSI people just ignored, they were
not co-operative, then how we can deal?
Again, I hope LSI people in the Cc'ed list can read this mail and give replies.

That approach almost cannot solve the bug, we don't have the
card/firmware specification, the debugging will be very hard.

Please James notice this, the major version difference, but the mpt in
the mainstream is "3.04.07", outdated.

Cool, if Eric can read this, I'm willing to help make all this happen.
