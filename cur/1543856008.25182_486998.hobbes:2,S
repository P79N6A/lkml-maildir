Under heavy network or I/O pressure it may not have time to swap to get
the memory. Thus adding swap won't usually help. Adding RAM may do but
its often not the best answer. Arjan's suggestion should sort it, and -
yes typically boxes with very high I/O and network load need more of a
pool of memory free for immediate use than other systems.
