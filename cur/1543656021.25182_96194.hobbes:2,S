Calling scrup is out of place. It is only called by lf() and csi_M() in 
the vt.c. lf() is used in vt_console_print but it is called before 
set_cursor(). Also vgacon_cursor doesn't call vgacon_scroll. It can call 
vgacon_scrolldelta. Now scrup does call vgacon_scroll. It looks like The 
code jumped from the middle of vt_console_print to scrup. Do you get the 
same error all the time? Also do you have Preemptible Kernel turned on?
