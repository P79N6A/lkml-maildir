Serious? I'd rather leave the deadlock in there than introduce a
very hard to reproduce data corruption bug to fix it. At least the
deadlock is fail-stop and you can tell exactly what happened when
you hit it (assuming you can get a trace).
Then again, we've got lots more similar little correctness corner
cases like this that most people don't notice most of the time. Am
I aiming too high?

We have to write something back to the filesystem because it may have
allocated blocks at this point.

Not all truncates hold i_mutex. Neither do all invalidates, for that
matter.
