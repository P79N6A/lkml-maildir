OK, thanks... but the question above was only about the exiting leader in
the middle of exec...
Do we behave correctly when we send the specific "special" KILL/STOP/CONT
signal to the zombie leader when the thread group is alive?
For example, SIGKILL is silently (has subtle side effect) ignored, SIGSTOP
doesn't stop but has side effects, SIGCONT works.
Hmm? If this is not correct we can fix it.

Ah, this. Yes I know, we can lost the non-fatal group-wide signal
on mt-exec. Note that we don't need to block the signal, it could
be stealed by sub-thread anyway.

Yes sure.
But I already thought about this, and actually I was almost going
to send something like the (incomplete) patch below.
What do you think? Do you agree it should fix all problems with
the group signals vs exec?
Oleg.
