Subject: [2.4.22-pre4] hangs on init start with 'block clobbered'

Hi all...
Plain 2.4.22-pre4 hangs when tries to launch init. booting to runlevel 5 I get:
INIT: version 2.85 booting
INIT: Entering runlevel 5
malloc: block on free list clobbered
Stopping myself...Kernel panic: Attempted to kill init!
If i try to boot in singleuser (runlevel 1), the booting process just
stops after the version line.
Any ideas ?
Notes:
- Kernel is built with gcc-3.3.1 prerelease
- Previous kernels work fine (built with plain 3.3)(I did nor try -pre3)
- -pre2 does not emit the 'Entering...' message. ???
So I tend to blame gcc. Will try to rebuild -pre2 with gcc-3.3.1 to see
if the compiler is the reason. But if anyone has a clue, I would be
grateful.
