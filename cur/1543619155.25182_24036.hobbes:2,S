Please don't just accumulate stuff.
It would be useful to know which of the patches still
applies against the most recent 2.2, 2.4 or 2.5 kernel,
so each patch gets some status fields:
1) applies against 2.2
2) applies against 2.4
3) applies against 2.5
4) was applied to 2.2
5) was applied to 2.4
6) was applied to 2.5
7) bitrotted patch, no longer applies and wasn't
   applied ... moved to 'old' queue
kind regards,
Rik
