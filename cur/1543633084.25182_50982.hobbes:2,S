Thanks for the effort, that was a quick turnaround :)
But unfortunately the patch is wrong.
You need to use an index which counts _tulip_ boards, which implies that 
the index is local to the driver.  Currently the only such counter is 
board_idx, which is a variable local to tulip_init_one().
I wonder who the heck this patch is from??  Mikael?  The "Lightweight 
patch manager" seems neat, but a rather unfriendly person to reply to :)
Regards,

P.S. A ChangeLog entry (in the patch, or to be cut-n-pasted) is missing 
also.
