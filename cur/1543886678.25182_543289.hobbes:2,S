We made a plugin to dokukwiki - that grabs our maintained kernel source from 
our scm system, and display it in our wiki. It helps to see the text 
explanation, and the actual up todate code. (no maintenance when code is 
updated) It also automatically inserts some links to the scm web interface.
An example is at here:
http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/doku.php?id=interrupts#interrupt_discovery
Things to do:
 - doesn't support git today - but should be a trivial change
 - links to lxr - again pretty trivial
 - write a cron that goes through the wiki source daily, poking someone to 
check the wiki text when the source changes.
