AFAIK, shortcuts are symlinks with funny semantics, (eg. start in
directory foo option) that only the Windows GUI seems to understand.
Ie. nothing like them at all.
The technique described in the paper looks like an automatic method of
collecting files from around the network and storing them at a central
server.  The files on local computers would have to be replaced with
something more like true symlinks.
What happens if your only "Single Instance Server" goes down, is not
explained in the article.
cheers,
 James
