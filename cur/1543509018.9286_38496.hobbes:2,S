FYI, i'm working on a patch for 2.3 that adds the NMI oopser (optionally,
because 1) it doesnt work on all SMP boxes, and 2) it forces the timer irq
to the BP) to the 2.3 kernel. Looks like one of the most common uses of
IKD is lockup detection - the rest is mostly used by kernel hackers. I'll
post it together with some other x86 APIC fixes and irq cleanups soon.
