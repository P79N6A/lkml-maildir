I disagree here. To me it looks like obj-y is a misuse of the
obj-$(CONFIG_XXX) rule.
It looks much more intuitive to have a separate rule. But common practice
today differ so it should stay.
Another argument is that we should keep the way to express things down
only one way.

You used EXTRA_TARGETS to make sure host-progs programs got compiled.
In general the way to use host-progs is not nice.
Typical usage:
host-progs := gentbl
include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make
%tbl: %data: $(obj)/somefile.data $(obj)/gentbl
	gentbl $< $@
In other words you need to make an explicit prerequisite to the host-progs
to get it build, which is what you did with EXTRA_TARGETS.
I would advocate for another solution:
Let programs listed in host-progs be compiled always.
Then the makefile could assign host-progs conditionally instead.
find -name Makefile | xargs grep host-progs | wc -l
12
A doable task, that I'm ready to do.
We could also define 
force-host-progs :=
or something similar.

Untested:
$(notdir $(@:.o=-objs))
