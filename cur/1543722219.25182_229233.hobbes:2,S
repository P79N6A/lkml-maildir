Wow.  That's really interesting, and gives a good starting point to
look at, where the command line is stored.  But the EDD code shouldn't
be using any of the space that the command line occupies, ever...

It *feels* like a BIOS bug (or bugs), as you're the first to report
such a problem.  I've got one success report with this motherboard
dated 8 Feb 2004.
Motherboard:  Gigabyte GA-7IXE4
BIOS version: FAd  (that's a beta version)
Kernel:       2.6.2-mm1
The question is, which of the int13 calls is messing up your BIOS?
The "read MBR sector and save the 4-byte MBR signature" code was added
there at 2.6.3, which is quite coincident.
This is the code, in arch/i386/boot/setup.S, which makes that int13
call.  Can you try #if 0'ing this chunk out and see if this helps?
+# Read the first sector of device 80h and store the 4-byte signature
+       movl    $0xFFFFFFFF, %eax
+       movl    %eax, (DISK80_SIG_BUFFER)       # assume failure
+       movb    $READ_SECTORS, %ah
+       movb    $1, %al                         # read 1 sector
+       movb    $0x80, %dl                      # from device 80
+       movb    $0, %dh                         # at head 0
+       movw    $1, %cx                         # cylinder 0, sector 0
+       pushw   %es
+       pushw   %ds
+       popw    %es
+       movw    $EDDBUF, %bx
+       int     $0x13
+       jc      disk_sig_done
+       movl    (EDDBUF+MBR_SIG_OFFSET), %eax
+       movl    %eax, (DISK80_SIG_BUFFER)       # store success
+disk_sig_done:
+       popw    %es
+
If so, then I'd like to believe that it's definitely a BIOS bug, as
int13 reads to the MBR had better work (gee, that's how the boot
loader got loaded in the first place, right?)
Thanks,
Matt
