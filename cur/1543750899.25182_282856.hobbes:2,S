Very nice patch. One request: Can you global and EXPORT_SYMBOL
the scanning function?
There is a kernel testing technique called "thrashing" that relies
on doing some custom stress from a kernel module and then checking
all state very often to catch corruption early. Calling the slab check m
ore often from such a test module would be useful.
Also I would make the slab test interval a kernel parameter to 
force more regular checking during stress testing.
