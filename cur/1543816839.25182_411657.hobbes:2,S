The userspace RDMA-CM is currently being used by uDAPL and seems to 
work fine for that application. Our testing so far shows that the code is
stable. However, uDAPL also has a socket based mechanism that can used until
the CMA 
is merged. If others think it still needs more time to mature, then uDAPL
has an interim solution.
my 2 cents on this one.
