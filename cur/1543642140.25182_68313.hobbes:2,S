Matt,
  That looks exactly like what I'd need.  Thanks.
I grabbed the "2.4.20-pre5" source of linuxppc_2_4_devel, and
I do see those options in there.
However, my problem is that I cannot move to a development kernel for
this application -> i have to stick on the stable tree.  So i could
either wait for 2.4.20 to come out, OR could i just look at where
"CONFIG_LOWMEM_SIZE" and "CONFIG_KERNEL_START" are used in 2.4.20-pre5
and patch them back myself to 2.4.18?
Regardless, thanks very much to everyone who replied for the info.
