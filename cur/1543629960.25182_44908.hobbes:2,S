people who want tux are probably going to want some other related bits
and pieces.  this is a distribution issue.  remove khttpd (even if it is
suddenly maintained again) and let it and tux both be external entities.
tux is more an application than an interface or mechanism.  applications
historically haven't been distributed as part of the main kernel tree.
