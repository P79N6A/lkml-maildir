i said this before: using segmentation tricks these days is /insane/. 
Segmentation is not for free, and it's not going to be cheap in the 
future. In fact, chances are that it will be /more/ expensive in the 
future, because sane OSs just make no use of them besides the trivial 
"they dont even exist" uses.
so /at a minimum/, as i suggested it before, the kernel's segment use 
should not overlap that of glibc's. I.e. the kernel should use %fs, not 
%gs.
