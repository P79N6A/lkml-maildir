OK, make it 8GB then.
And as a bonus we get all you IBM guys back on the case again
to finish the job that was started on highmem :)
And as another bonus, you actually *have* the capability to unplug
memory or use hugepages exactly the size you require, which is not the
case with the frag patches.

Not really it isn't. There have been a few cases (e1000 being the main
one, and is fixed upstream) where fragmentation in general is a problem.
But mostly it is not.
Anyone who thinks they can start using higher order allocations willy
nilly after Mel's patch, I'm fairly sure they're wrong because they are
just going to be using up the contiguous regions.
Trust me, if the frag patches were a general solution that solved the
generic fragmentation problem I would be a lot less concerned about the
complexity they introduce. But even then it only seems to be a problem
that a very small number of users care about.
Anyway I keep saying the same things (sorry) so I'll stop now.
