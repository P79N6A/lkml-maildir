"const char *p", and "char const *p", both define a pointer to a constant
char, the char can't be changed, the pointer can.
"char * const p" defines a constant pointer to a char, you can't change
the pointer, but you can change the char.
"const" just means you can't read it, it's still a normal variable, just
one that the compiler doesn't allow you to change.
