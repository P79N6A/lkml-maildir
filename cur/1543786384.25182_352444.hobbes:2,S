One of the things I'm _really_ missing from OSDL's bugzilla setup is a mailing
list (if there's one I've never heard about it) where all changes/new bugs/
random crap are posted. Something like:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xorg-bugzilla-noise/2005-April/thread.html
-
To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in
the body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.org
