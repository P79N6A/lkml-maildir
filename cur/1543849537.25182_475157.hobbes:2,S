Well, sparc always was crud. I can see the missing tlb entry, but if it's 
been turned read-only, the write-back should still work (it clearly _was_ 
writable when the write that dirtied the cacheline happened).
Anyway, if you cannot flush a read-only mapping, then the "flush at COW 
fault time" won't work _either_, since the original mapping is still 
read-only.
So regardless, the COW-time flush cannot work. But the "flush before the 
TLB flush, and then flush after in case we had a race" approach should 
work as well as it can in practice, no?
