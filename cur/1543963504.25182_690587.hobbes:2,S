The thing is, a lot of these things have been done this way because not 
doing them that way breaks.
We want to allocate expansion ROM space - even if we don't enable it - 
because not doing so will screw up bus sizing etc, and can make it 
impossible to allocate later.
In general, changing PCI allocation strategy is really _really_ dangerous, 
even when it is "right", because it tends to expose a lot of issues where 
something worked just because it was perhaps indirectly causing a layout 
that worked.
So the reason I immediately reverted this is that it was simply totally 
wrong. If somebody cares about multi-node systems, the onus of making 
those work should be on *that*, not on old systems that already work.
Ingo, Thomas: I would _seriously_ suggest that you don't consider the x86 
PCI setup code to be "x86" code. Because it isn't. Not in that sense. Just 
don't take patches to it.
