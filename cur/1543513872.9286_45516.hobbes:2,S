It really is as simple as it looks -- I used it for implementing the PPP
active-filter / pass-filter options. Assuming you're getting a BPF-like
filter "program" from user space (the user-space code can hack into libpcap
to generate it), just call sk_chk_filter to make sure it's sane, then call
sk_run_filter to check a packet against the filter.
