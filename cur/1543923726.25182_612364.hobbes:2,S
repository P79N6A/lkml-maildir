iirc they tended to hang for whatever reason when the mcfg
area was accessed, not just not detect anything.

They were :/ The bug flowed from a Intel reference BIOS to lots of
production boards.

That's a different issue. The spec does not require it to be e820-reserved.
That was just a (bogus) heuristic originally added to handle the early BIOS
bug. Even BIOS where the mcfg is fine do not reserve it there.
There were some patches to check it against ACPI resources (which
was presumably better specification conforming and more importantly
similar to what M$ does). I'm not sure that fixed all problems and
made the e820 check obsolete though.

Well the overlapping to MMIO would have been fine as design if BIOS had
gotten it right.  Trying to design things that BIOS can't get it wrong
is probably futile -- the BIOSes would just find more subtle ways to break.
The real problem I guess was that Linux was trying to use it before 
Windows which is usually a bad idea regarding BIOS support at least
in the Desktop/Laptop space.
