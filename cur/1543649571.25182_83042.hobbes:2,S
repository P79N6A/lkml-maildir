Most of our users (and we) happen to use ext[23], so there isn't any point
in migrating SELinux to using EAs until EA implementations are merged into
those filesystems.  Also, the EA API lacks support for creating files with
specified security attributes (as opposed to creating and then calling
setxattr to change the attributes, possibly after someone has already
obtained access to the file), so it isn't ideal for our purposes anyway.
