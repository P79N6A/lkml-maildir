I actually pondered a while on this, and settled on
the cut'n'paste-from-mtrr.c version. There is no error
check there, and I just overlooked it.
The defence for the #ifdefs is that I didn't see
register_chrdev() being aware of devfs, and I thought
we'd be better off just not calling register_chrdev()
at all if we have devfs.
It's not like I personally like #ifdefs, but it seemed
justified to my inexperienced eyes at that point. And
there's a #ifdef CONFIG_DEVFS_FS around the call in
mtrr.c too, and I thought it safe to do like what's
already in the official tree.
In microcode.c however, is the new-style without #ifdef
(or rather with the #ifdef in the headers instead)
and with error checking, but microcode_init() doesn't
use register_chrdev() anyway, even if devfs is not
supported.
Please enlighten me!
