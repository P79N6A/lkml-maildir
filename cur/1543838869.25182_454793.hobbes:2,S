this limit is for newly created UBs, host system (ub0) is
_unlimited_ by default.
The idea was to limit the user by default to make system secure.
do you think it is good idea to have unlimited users created by default?
Anyway, after creating UB context normal behaviour would be to set
some limits.
Thanks,
Kirill
