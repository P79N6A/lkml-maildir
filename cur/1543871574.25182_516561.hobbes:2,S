the irq stacks aren't the problem; RH at some point accidentally shipped
a kernel with 4k *shared* irq/user context stack and even that gave
almost no issues.
irq's really shouldn't actually nest; it's bad for just about everything
to do that (but that's another story, I would *love* to get rid of the
"enable irqs" thing in the x86 irq path, it hurts just about anything in
reality)
