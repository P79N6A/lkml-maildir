Then I am happy (as long as you don't take a reserved number).
Concerning policy, of course that is up to Linus -
for myself I would prefer adding a well-motivated ioctl
above reserving a number. After all, an ioctl is almost
always about transporting some small amount of information,
hence is implemented by a dozen lines of code or so,
clean, and without impact on the rest of the kernel,
so if it is going to be added eventually it might as well
be added immediately.
So, until Linus says otherwise, you might try once or twice
to submit the actual ioctl instead of just the reservation.
