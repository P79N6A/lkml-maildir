Hello,
I am facing this issue when i am testing my USB serial driver on Redhat
Linux 2.6.9 , EL version 4  with my application. The driver is written
for OXUSB950 and OXUSB954 devices.
 This application executes a set of transfer for one usb -serial port to
another . I have various combinations of transfers - unidirectional ,
bidirectional . The applications also tries to compare the data that was
sent is actually received on the other port . For bidirectional , a
window of data(1000 bytes)is written and read one byte at a time.
Basically read is slow as compared to writes.  This application gets
incorrect byte . The transfer where the application gets a mismatch is
most of the times the bidirectional test. Application is attached.
My observations - 
With this application , even when I do tty_flip_buffer_push() in the
bottom half  of the usb serial driver the flip count does not become
zero . I find the TTY_DONT_FLIP bit is also remaining set. The point
when the flip count crosses 512  I get an erroneous byte at the
application . This erroneous byte is the byte that is inserted by the
driver when the flip buffer is flipped some time later. Not sure
who/when/why this flip happens. This should be because later the
TTY_DONT_FLIP bit is reset when the line disc is no longer processing
data from the flip buffer.
The bottom half is meant to process the data recieved from the device
and push it to the tty and ldisc above . I have verified that i get
corect data in the bottom half of the driver. However the time when
tty_flip_buffer_push() does not flip the buffer and i do
tty_insert_flip_char() which causes the flip buffer to drop the data.
Note : the driver has the low_latency flag set .
Is this issue related to high baud rate , nature of the application (
read slower than writes) that causes the layer above the driver to go in
this scenario.
Is there any bug/race condition happening in the tty /ldisc layer for
the mentioned kernel version.
I am looking for some pointers to debug this issue. i am novice with the
intricacies of the tty and ldisc layer. I have taken help of Greg's
documents on the linux journal to understand the basics required when
writing usb-serial driver.
How should the usb-serial driver handle this - if for unknown reason the
flip buffer cannot be flipped and the data being that has been pushed
can overrun the buffer. Any inputs ?  
Thanks and Regards,
Monali
