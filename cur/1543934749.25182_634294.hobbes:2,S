I'm not using quilt but git.
Unfortunatelly size changed:
paolo@paolo-desktop:/tmp$ size profile.o
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   3718     144      12    3874     f22 profile.o
paolo@paolo-desktop:/tmp$ size profile.o.after
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   3693     144      12    3849     f09 profile.o.after
I'll post the patch for review in a minute.
Thanks.
