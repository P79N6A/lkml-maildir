The separation of timekeeing from the timer tick is one of the core
design goals here. This allows timer ticks to be modulated without
affecting timekeeping, so I expect this should simplify noidletick. I
know you've mentioned it before, but I don't think I've seen the
noidletick work on lkml. Do you have a link to this work, so I could
make sure the meshing is as nice as I hope it to be?

Again, it is a bit of complexity, but I feel I've resolved the issue
well. However, since it does require more care, specific feedback and
suggestions for improvements will be greatly welcomed.

I disagree that this is just a cleanup. This work is focused on keeping
time correctly, and it fixes a number problems where timekeeping
inconsistencies have been seen by customers. Most specifically, those
dealing with late or lost timers interrupts. Its just that to fix these
issues much of the code had to be reworked, so I spent some time making
sure the new method was reusable by other arches and made other time
related features (HRT, dynmaic ticks, etc) simpler.
Again, I really look forward to any suggestions you have for the code.
thanks
