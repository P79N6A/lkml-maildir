Mostly CONFIG_NET_NS is a define to keep us from exposing the feature to
user space not to remove the code impact.  People could not stand the
look of the code that would actually allow us to compile everything out.
So all of the struct net * fields remain when !CONFIG_NET_NS.
Including the global variable init_net.
