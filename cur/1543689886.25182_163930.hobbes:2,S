Hi,
I've got a SIS735 chipset and i'm therefor using the usb-ohci module.
After upgrading from 2.4.21 to 2.4.22 my USB doens't work anymore.
lsusb doesn't show any devices - find /proc/bus/usb too.
On my laptop everything works fine with 2.4.22, but it has an intel 
chipset and uses UHCI instead of OHCI.
I read the Changelog and didn't find anything that looks like the reason 
for my trouble. I double checked that every module is there in my 2.4.22 
config. I even did "make oldconfig" after copying my config from the 
2.4.21 kernel.
With 2.4.22 my USB just look dead.
I also tried to copy usb-ohci.c from 2.4.21 to 2.4.22 and recompiled the 
kernel. Nothing changed (the diff wasn't that big, so i tried that).
Any ideas? If you need more information or just want me to try a patch 
just ask.
Thx
   Sven
