Hi Jan,
So, if the proprietary code exposes an interface and if the code within
the GPL makes a call to that interface, will the proprietary code become
part of GPL. Please suggest
Regards,
Nutan

Technically yes.

More or less. If my understanding of the GPL is correct, the "combined" 
thing (the kernel machinery, as in: the contents of your RAM) becomes
GPL. 
But since proprietary code involved, it's gets a hell lot more
complicated, 
since, obviously, you can't just GPLize proprietary code of others.
