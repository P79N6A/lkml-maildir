I'm over 1100 emails behind here, so please excuse me if I'm repeating 
what someone else said.
But are you implying, by analogy, that if I were to write a program 
using GTK+ that the application would be forced to be under GPL?  So I 
can't write a closed-source GNOME program?  Or is GTK under LGPL?
Anyhow, I see little problem with the Qt model.  If I'm writing a 
closed-source commercial app that I'm going to sell, it's no skin off my 
nose to pay TrollTech a little money to use their toolkit, considering 
that I'm probably going to need some support anyhow.
