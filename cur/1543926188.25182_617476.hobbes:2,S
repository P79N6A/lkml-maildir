Okay.  Is that 32-bit or 64-bit?  How much RAM ?
My PPC machine is not currently set up for Linux,
and has only PCIX (not PCIe) slots, so I'll try this
first on an x86-32 box with PCIe.
If it works for me there, then I may be able to try
a PCIX card in my PPC-32 box later.  The PCIX card
won't have a 7042 of course, so I'll use a 6081 instead.
Those earlier Marvell chips are supposed to be extremely similar.
