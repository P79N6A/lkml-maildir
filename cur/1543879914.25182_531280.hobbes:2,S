That would mean an additional syscall.  Furthermore, if you allocate a big
chunk of memory, dirty it, then free (with madvise (MADV_FREE)) it and soon
allocate the same size of memory again, it is better to start that with
non-dirty memory, it might be that this time you e.g. don't modify a big
part of the chunk.  If all that memory was kept dirty all the time and
just marked/unmarked for lazy reuse with MADV_FREE/MADV_UNDO_FREE, all that
memory would need to be saved to disk when paging out as it was marked
dirty, while with current Rik's MADV_FREE that will happen only for pages
that were actually dirtied after the last malloc.
