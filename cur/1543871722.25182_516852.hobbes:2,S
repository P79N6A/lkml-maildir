... with the exception that it will again make data associated with
sysfs attributes accessible past the point of returning from
sysfs_remove_file. And that was the point so drivers would not have to
care about handling access to extra data (such as static strings) past
the driver unload.
I wonder if we should keep Oliver's change and require attribute
implementations to offload "delete me" kind of actions to workqueues.
