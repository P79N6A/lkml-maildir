You get suffciently recent kernel headers for libc. Libc might need
recompiling when you do that.
The reason is, that now /usr/include/linux is no longer a link to kernel
sources in most distribution, since it was found, that there can be
problems when application is compiled with different headers than libc.
Thus you need to instal new headers and may need recompiling libc if
problems show up.
