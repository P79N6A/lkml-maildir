Understood (all your points). Ok, my latest /proc/driver/microcode patch
can't do the above, but just uses the ioctl. Ok, standby for the next
enhancement - the write(2) support so you could just
dd if=microcode of=/proc/driver/microcode bs=2048 count=48
That will obsolete mcode tool which is good. I should have thought of it
myself - in fact, in both /dev and /proc approaches it is better to
support *both* ioctl and write and not just ioctl.
Regards,
Tigran.
