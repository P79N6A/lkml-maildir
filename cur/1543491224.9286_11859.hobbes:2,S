     I just compiled the latest kernel 2.2.4 OK but when I 'make zlilo' I get a
message about the kernel being too big and should try bzImage or modules.  I
do a 'make bzImage' OK I think but now what do I do?  Why is my kernel too big
for lilo?  I looked in the FAQs about problems like this but found nothing. 
                                Thanks
