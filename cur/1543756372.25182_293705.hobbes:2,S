Hi,
I'm using 2.6.11-rc3 + Peter's patch and xorg from Fedora Core 3, I
still have touchpad problems.
Tapping and focus work fine with 2.6.10 and 2.6.11-rc1 but not with :
- 2.6.11-rc2
- 2.6.11-rc3
I read a similar report on LKML from David Ford.
Only one tap on 30 is received and focus is really strange.
Like said in previous mails, small movements are rounded off to 0 but
the Peter Osterlund's patch resolves this problem (tested with rc3).
Hardware
kernel: input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS TouchPad on isa0 060/serio1
Vaio GRT916V
In my xorg.conf :
Driver      "mouse"
Option      "Protocol" "IMPS/2"
Bye,
Stephane Raimbault
