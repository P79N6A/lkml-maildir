The VP3 DMA workaround stuff is only used by sound cards, and is specific
to some 16bit ISA DMA funnies. How is your VP3 set up, I have mine set up
as 66MHz memory bus, 33MHz CPU bus, Cyrix MII CPU, write allocate enabled [
I think. Intel i740 in the AGP slot, 3c509 ethernet. Other cards not in use.
The IDE drive Im using is pre UDMA. The other drive is a 640Mb M/O ATAPI drive
using ide-scsi, which afaik is also non UDMA
