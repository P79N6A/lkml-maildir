[~]2 /bin/bash -c ignore echo a b c
echo: line 1: ignore: command not found
[~]2 /bin/bash -c 'ignore echo a b c'
/bin/bash: line 1: ignore: command not found
Obviously, tokenization makes a difference here. ;)
So let's try forcing $0 to /bin/bash rather than 'ignore'...
[~]2 sh -c '/bin/bash echo a b c'
echo: /bin/echo: cannot execute binary file
Correct, but unexpected results..
[~]2 sh -c /bin/echo echo a b c
[~]2 sh -c '/bin/echo a b c'
a b c
Again, tokenization matters - try working out what the value of argc is
for the exec of /bin/bash for each of these cases...
Dick, do you have an 'ignore' in your $PATH?
