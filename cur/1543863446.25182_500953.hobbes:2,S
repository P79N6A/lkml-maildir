Well, unfortunately it is also wrong thing to do :-(.

Imagine for a moment that we solve time-warp somehow. Any other
problems? [I'd really like to get "is user idle" solved, but it really
should not be in kernel unless it _has_ to. And time-warp probably
causes problems not only for your daemon.]
