There is nothing "broken" here. You have a ICH8 (without R) that drives
four SATA ports, which are handled by ata_piix.
Then you have a Jmicron JMB363 -- it handles the PATA-Channel and two
SATA-Ports -- one internal (near the battery)/next to the PCI-Slot and a
external eSATA port. Seems you configured it in AHCI-Mode in the
BIOS-Setup. Linux will work just fine if you connect the hard disc to
that port. But if you want to install Windows XP you need a driver from
Jmicron.
There were BIOSes for the P5B where you could enabled AHCI for the ICH8
as well. It seems Asus removed it in the later BIOS-versions again as
Intel doesn't provide a Windows-AHCI driver for the basic ICH8.
HTH and clarifies some of your problems.
