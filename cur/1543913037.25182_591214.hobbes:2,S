That's exactly the point I was making, if your tests and any others 
people feel are useful were in a module and/or could be run as init code 
only when wanted, everyone could benefit from the tests. Anything 
related to build sanity could be in one place, to guard against 
surprises like new versions of gcc, typos in patches, etc.
