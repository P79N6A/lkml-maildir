just extracted the tar.bz2 file and the typed make xconfig.  Im not exactly

# nohup make modules 1> modules.out 2> modules.err &
produces compile errors (modules.out and modules.err attached)

i have attached the output from gdb, I normally get the xLib errors when 
starting X programs, it is a known problem when using mandrake 9.1 and 
tightvnc (which I am)
