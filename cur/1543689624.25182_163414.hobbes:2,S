Actually, you mean "writing a good optimizer is a very tough thing to do".
The problem is NOT the compiler, or the coder. A "well defined" algorithm
such as the twofish mentioned CAN be compiled well by almost any compiler,
but the code optimizer MUST be at the highest level. There is also the
problem that what is optimum for one CPU, is NOT optimum for the next
generation, even if it uses the same identical architecture. This is where
the human coder can beat the compiler. That person will make many, many passes
through the code, and try similar/related instructions to optimize the result.
This amount of optimization also means that the result may not work at all on
a different processor member of the architecture, it is MUCH more likely to
run slower. Even minor things like the size of cache in the processor will
affect the human coder.
This a compiler cannot do since the optimizer is targeted toward a family of
processors and not a single member of that family. It will provide the most
compatibility. And since it is in a higher level language, the translation to
many other architectures is possible, even those that do not have available
human coders. The advantage the compiler has is that the optimizer can recieve
input from MANY excellent coders contributing rules for code generation. This
give the compiler the ability to surpass 90+% of the coders, and exceed the
productivity of all the assember coders.
The final question is "Is it fast enough?"
Only if this question is NO does it make sense to do assember. It doesn't
matter if it can be faster. And portability means you don't have to speed
hours rewriting it...
