If it involves changing the TCP stack locking stuff and putting the old
list back, it's probably not worth the bother.  The only thing we're
using the file for (other than the occasional admin-run "netstat") is to
check to see what ports are listening on the machine without actually
attempting to connect to them.  We check our services this way more often
than actually connecting and requesting a response to reduce log clutter
and testing load on the server.  Is there an easier way to accomplish
this than parsing /proc/net/tcp?  We could attempt to bind to the ports
we want to check, but that would race with daemons trying to start up.
