I also don't see why the VFS/Filesystem can't decide that (for example) 
this tar.gz is so active that instead of storing it as a tar.gz and 
providing a virtual directory of the contents that it instead stores the 
directory of the contents and makes the tar.gz virtual (regenerating it as 
needed or as extra system resources are available)
implementation wise I see headaches in doing this, but conceptually this 
is just an optimization that could take place in the future if we fine 
that it's needed.
