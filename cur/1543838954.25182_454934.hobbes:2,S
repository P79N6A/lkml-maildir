It's not a flag. This one sets loglevel 7 for SCSI_LOG_SCAN.
So all SCSI_LOG_SCAN messages might show up.
The loglevel can also be set using sysctl dev.scsi.logging_level.
Anyone interested in a script to conveniently interpret or change the
SCSI logging level? Such a script (scsi_logging_level) exists in the
s390-tools package (version 1.5.3).
If others show interest for this script, maybe a better place can be
found than s390-tools (because it is not really s390-specific).
Regards,
Andreas
