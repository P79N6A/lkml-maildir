You'll agree, I think, that add_disk in mmc_block_probe issues a lot of requests (reads partition
table, fs superblocks and such - plenty of room for critical errors). Then, driver's remove method
will not be called before driver's probe method had finished. So mmc_block is quite involved, even
though it does not affect the problem's resolution.
Besides this, I have a new version of the tifm driver to submit. It fixes quite a few problems and
improves performance a little. Hopefully, it's better tested than the previous one.
