Thanks for quick reply.
I tried 2.6.26rc1. It hangs same as 2.6.25.
kernel 2.6.26rc1 with cs5520 cannot boot. cs5520 scans ide0 and ide1.
It seems 2nd port DMA base issue was solved.
dmesg is follow:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-EDI driver
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes: override with idebus=xx
Cyrix 5520: IDE controller (0x1078:0x0002 rev 0x00) at  PCI slot 0000:00:12.0
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x5000-0x5007
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x5008-0x500f

I seems that this issue was resolved. Thanks.
