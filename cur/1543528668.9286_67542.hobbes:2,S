See ptrace_writedata in kernel/ptrace.c.
That copies data from one address space to another.
It's not even arch specific.

ptrace_writedata copies from the current user address space directly to
a different one.  The two address spaces don't need to be mapped
simultaneously, and they are both swappable.
The kernel address space isn't involved, except to create a temporary
mapping one page at a time (like your code).

The surgery in this case is minor.
Take a look at swap_out in mm/vmscan.c, where it searches the process
list to pick an mm `best'.  `best' is chosen based on mm parameters not
process parameters (except p->swappable, which doesn't count).
Tweak that to iterate look at p->execve_mm too if there is one.
p->execve_mm is normally 0, but during exec you set it to point to a new
memory map while building arguments.  Then at the point of no return you
dump the old map and replace with the new one.
You can just not have an execve_mm at first, and still implement
argument construction using a second mm.  That removes the limit, but
doesn't make the pages swappable during construction.

That's what I said :-)

I read some of the patch and realised you kept a limit, but I didn't
notice the run time configuration part.
I like the idea of removing the limit altogether because it's not
necessary, and large command lines are occasionally useful.
There's no reason why root should have to choose between trusting users
not to abuse this and disabling it, because there's no reason for this
to be abusable at all.
I shall have a look at implementing my idea.
