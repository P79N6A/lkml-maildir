Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
The compiler said
arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-calgary.c(600): remark #593: variable "bbar" was set 
but never used
arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-calgary.c(601): remark #593: variable "busnum" was 
set but never used
The source code is
    void __iomem *bbar;
    unsigned char busnum;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variables.
Regards
David Binderman
