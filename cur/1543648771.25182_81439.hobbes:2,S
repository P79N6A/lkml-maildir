That's *a* problem, but not (IMHO) the most significant problem.
The biggest disadvantages with chroot() (as I see it) are:
 * not useable unless you're root
 * too coarse-grained
 * only protects the filesystem, but not other resources (e.g., the network)
 * not suitable for jailing root

This is not quite right.  There are LOTS of other ways that root
can break out of a chroot.
Actually, I suspect that nested chroot()s may not be needed very
frequently, so I think a simpler approach may be simply to prevent
a chrooted process from calling chroot() again: i.e., prevent nesting.
