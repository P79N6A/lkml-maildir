Steinar, I'm still wondering where this came from?
This is the first time I've heard this and the first time I wrote a Unix
daemon was fifteen years ago.
As far as I'm concerned redirecting stdin, stdout and stderr to the null 
device, then closing it and setting the process to a be the group leader 
(as autofs does) should be all that's needed to daemonize a process.
So are we saying that we don't trust the kernel to reliably duplicate the 
state of file handles when we fork?
If that's the case then the kernel is badly broken and needs fixing, not 
autofs!
