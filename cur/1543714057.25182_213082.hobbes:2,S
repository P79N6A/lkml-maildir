   Yes, that's unfortunately a limitation.  Most of the standard
interfaces either take no parameters or have no return value, so they
fit nicely into this framework.  I'm open to suggestions on how to work
around this.  We could make the store function save off the method
parameters, then the show function would call the method with the saved
parameters and return the results.  Obviously there are some userspace
ordering issues that could make this complicated, but it's easy to code
on the kernel side.  Other ideas?  Thanks,
	Alex
