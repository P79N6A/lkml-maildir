being not able to set the file times via utimes is a _major_
missing feature in cifs, so
  cp -p /client/file /server
does not work regarding servers like win9x/me and os/2.
The source time stamps are not transfered to the server!
The current local time on the server is set instead for
all time stamps. 
The reason is a missing implementation of legacy versions of
  setfileinfo
  setpathinfo
I had that already working months ago, but it never made it
upstream ...
Possibly we could give it a 2nd try?
Cheers, Günter
