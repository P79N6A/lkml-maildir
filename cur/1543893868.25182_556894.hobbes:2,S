The licence can't redefine the copyright laws. It doesn't make it pure
nonsense BTW.

That would be the case if "the Program" (the whole or individual file(s))
contained something like:
"you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation".
Obviously, you could then choose any version including the first one.

This is very different (though unrelated) - patches are new work and
I hope you're free to use your MS Windows under old conditions if you
don't need the new work.

FSF has exactly nothing to say here (except that they've created
a useful licence). The author can choose whatever conditions he/she
likes.

It seems so.

It? What "it"?
I don't get it. If you say the licence is v2 only, then how can it have
options?

First, the local and international laws apply. It's not like selling your

... theoretically, by removing their work, perhaps. Back to reality...

There is no assumption of "GPL", you can only assume GPL v2 as the kernel
is v2. And it's not left for assumptions anymore, see "signed-off-by" and
licence tags (though the tags often specify "GPL" when the actual
licence, as indicated by the author, is GPL v2).

Sure, you can rewrite all non "GPLv2 or later" code and have v3 Linux.
The problem is you think only "few" files are v2.
