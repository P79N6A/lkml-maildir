Are you _sure_ your mouse is broken?  Did you try your Microsoft mouse
on another machine?
I ask because my Microsoft Intellimouse wireless started doing the same
thing after I installed 2.6.0-test11.  I haven't made a bug report
because I haven't had time to bother retrying -test10, removing the
binary Nvidia drivers, and taking out the Reiser4 patches.
But now that you've mentioned the same problem, I'm going to add a "Me
Too!"
And on a different machine, I'm using a Logitech MX700, and it works
perfectly under -test11.
