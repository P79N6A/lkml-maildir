There aren't really a whole lot of 32-bit boxen with > 4 GB of RAM (for
4 GB or less -- 2-3 GB or less if the chipset supports remapping --
normal HIGHMEM is all in the required area), and the few that are tend
to be running specialized applications (git.kernel.org is one of those
machines.)
Since it appears that legacy memory standards, SDRAM and DDR-1, aren't
dropping in price like DDR-2 is, I suspect that will more or less remain
that way.
The other problem -- which is a problem in general -- is the
proliferation of DMA masks, and that doesn't look like it's going to get
any better.
