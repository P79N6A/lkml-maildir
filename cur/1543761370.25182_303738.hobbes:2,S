Works for me:

total 0

The valyes of the fan* settings, and cpu_temp match what's reported in /proc/i8k.
temp1 is the same as cpu_temp.  temp2 is running about 7C higher and
is still unidentified (though probably the NVidia chip).
I'll give Dmitry's sysfs/array stuff a test tomorrow-ish unless Greg has
comments before then.
