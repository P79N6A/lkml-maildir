you are right, futexes are really important for all the userspace locking
primitives and thread-joining. And like basically all core kernel code,
futexes were a collaborative effort as well:
 *  Thanks to Ben LaHaise for yelling "hashed waitqueues" loudly
 *  enough at me, Linus for the original (flawed) idea, Matthew
 *  Kirkwood for proof-of-concept implementation.
there are so many prerequisites to this that it's impossible to list them
all. What i meant above were the specific patches developed for recent 2.5
kernels, and the library itself.
