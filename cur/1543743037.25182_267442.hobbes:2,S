It is correct.  You cannot force 224, 224, 224 colors on hardware that
accepts only 32, 64, 32.

Other drivers do not show the correct logo colors if using 224-color logo
in Directcolor RGB565.  And you cannot consider this a regression since
2.4 behaves in the same way.

Meaning, if you want 224-color logos, boot at 8-bit pseudocolor or 24-32 bit
Directcolor.  If the hardware supports it, but in truecolor at >=8 bpp.

Yep, this is a code snippet from the 2.4 logo code:
        if (p->visual == FB_VISUAL_DIRECTCOLOR) {
	    ...	
	    if (depth >= 24 && (depth % 8) == 0) {
		/* have at least 8 bits per color */
		src = logo;
		bdepth = depth/8;
		...
	    else if (depth >= 12 && depth <= 23) {
	        /* have 4..7 bits per color, using 16 color image */
		unsigned int pix;
		src = linux_logo16;
		...

It might work in the radeon, but it doesn't with others.
It's possible to convert the 224 logo to use a 32-entry color map.  If
really wanted, this can be done.
