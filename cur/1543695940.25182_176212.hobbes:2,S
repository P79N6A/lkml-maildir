Subject: vfat file system over usb fails for 2.6.0.test9

Two bug reports:
I just hooked up my camera, an Olympus that looks like a vfat 
filesystem over usb, and had to reboot from 2.6.0.test9 back to 
2.4.23-pre8 before I could get it to mount.  mount kept claiming that 
/dev/sda1 was not a block device until the reboot to the older 
kernel..
During the reboot, shutdown was hung for a few seconds per partition 
mounted claiming a bunch of illegal seeks and such.  This has been 
occuring with module-init-tools-0.9.15pre installed, but did not 
occur when I was running the 0.9.13pre version.  I'm gonna put 
0.9.13pre back in unless there is a good reason not to, so hit me 
with it, please.
