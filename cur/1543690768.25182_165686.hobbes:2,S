Okay, we need a little more information.
	What precise version of Linux 2.6?  2.6.0-test5?
	What model/make of CDRW/DVD drive?
	What interface?		e.g.	SCSI, IDE, USB, Firewire....
	What does 'dmesg' dump out?
	And yes, the .config might be useful.
| 	ide-scsi is disabled.
If it's an IDE drive, you'll want this _enabled_ before you'll be able
to write CDs.  Most of the burner software that I know of look for a
SCSI CD burner, not IDE.  ide-scsi is intended for making an IDE CD
burner appear as a SCSI device.
Don't reply directly to me -- I know quite a fair bit about Linux, but
compared to the majority of this list, I'm a newbie -- your reply is
best looked at by one of the gurus here.
