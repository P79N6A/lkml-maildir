Think about it from the point of view of being able to reduce the number of
times you need to talk to the allocator in a filesystem. You can talk to
the allocator about all of your readahead pages in one go, or you can do
things like allocate on flush rather than allocating page at a time (that is
a bit more complex, but not too much).
Having to talk to the allocator on a page by page basis is my pet peeve about
the current mechanisms.
