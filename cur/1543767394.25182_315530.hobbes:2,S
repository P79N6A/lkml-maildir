We're currently working on this, so as to be able to provide
interfaces to alternative page tables.  We want to be able to slot in
Liedtke's `Guarded Page Tables', or B-trees, or a hash table to see
what happens.
Except we've called the function:
       pte_t * lookup_page_table(unsigned long address, struct mm_struct *mm);
follow_page() is essentially the same after inline expansion happens;
but we're seeing a regression in clear_page_range() that we want to
fix before release.
If you want to take a look (warning: it's still fairly rough
work-in-progress) there's high level design being worked on at
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/IA64wiki/PageTableInterface
 
and patches from our CVS repository.  The only patch of interst is pti.patch.
