That won't help with the case where the NFS server doesn't support the
protocol extensions for xattr or where the NFS client doesn't want to
trust contexts provided by the server.  There is work in progress to add
support for passing process and file contexts on NFS requests/replies,
but that won't eliminate the need for this functionality for unmodified
or untrusted NFS servers.
