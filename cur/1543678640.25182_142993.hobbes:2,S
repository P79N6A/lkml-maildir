ONLY if you are a customer, are you? If not, why all this noice?
(They could require you to enter a serial number to get the source...)
A customer of a product B that uses GPL project A can
require the source for A. But what about the primary developer?
Suppose the company charges an obscene amount of money for
the product (that might be an enhanced project A, like a patch to allow 
compilation on Win32) - the primary developer might not afford to buy that
product.
One can hope that the customer is smart enough to release the source
to the original developer... But there are no guarantees...
