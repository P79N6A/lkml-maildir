Hi! ... In a Linux Kernel ...
What can I do to test the FD limit? ... Because, the FD limit is set in
/proc/sys/fs/file-max, sample:
echo "2048" > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
ulimit -n 8192
In this case ... the FD limit = 8192 :( ... when the limit should be
2048?
I wrote a perl script for the test ... anybody known a "C" program for
test the FD limit?
Thanks ...!
