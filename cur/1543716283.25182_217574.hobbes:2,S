I think he doesn't, because he can read what other said. I know what
distinction it is and I've been working on kernel for years since I was
still in school.
I'm not arguing about the taint issue, or any technical issue, as clearly
stated in my last paragraph. I am mearly responding to the questioning to
Linuxant's business model.
