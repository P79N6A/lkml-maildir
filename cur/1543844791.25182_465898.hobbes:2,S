It adds a lot of unnecessary defines. The problem is mostly that
for each register you add three macros.
The simplest way to avoid this would be using your bfin_write16()
and related functions directly instead of wrapping each register
in a separate macro.

Sure, that's not unusual at all. Instead of readl(), you can use
readw() for 16 bit accesses. Your bfin_{read,write}{16,32} functions
are fine as well, but you should make the implementation more robust
and change
#define bfin_read16(addr) ({
	unsigned __v; \
	__asm__ __volatile__ ("NOP;\n\t %0 = w[%1] (z);\n\t" \
	: "=d"(__v) : "a"(addr)); \
	(unsigned short)__v; \
})
to
static inline __le16 bfin_read16(const __be16 __iomem *addr)
{
	__be16 val;
	asm volatile("nop; \n\t %0 = w[%1] (z)" : "=d" (val) : "a"(addr);
	return val;
}
This adds strict type checking (size, endianess, io address space).
You may prefer to use u16 instead of __be16 here, depending on your needs.

Ok, in the example I picked they were all the same size, so I assumed
that would be the case for most of your register areas.

Ok, I see your point. If you have different size registers in
the area for a single device, then it is better to use a structure
as I showed below.

The run time overhead of this is very small compared to an actual mmio
register access, so you should not notice this at all.
You can still do the same with a compile time constant by replacing
static struct bfin_sica_regs __iomem *bfin_sica = (void __iomem *)0xffc00100ul;
from my example with 
#define bfin_sica_regs ((struct bfin_sica_regs __iomem*)0xffc00100ul)
That should result in the same object code you had before.
However, I'm used to having a single kernel binary that can run on
multiple hardware versions. Normally this means that you have the same
register layout on every CPU, but on different physical addresses that
are detected at boot time, so I like to avoid hardcoding absolute
addresses in the object code.
Moreover, if you ever want to run with an MMU, the virtual address of
that device is computed by the ioremap function, like
static struct bfin_sica_regs __iomem *bfin_sica;
void __init bfin_init_sica(void)
{
	bfin_sica = ioremap(0xffc00100ul);
}
