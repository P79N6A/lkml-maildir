Thanks for looking at it Chris. At least it seems that there is now a 
diagnosis of what's happening, which can be half the battle!
I'm surprised that this seems so rare, and that no-one else has reported it 
as a significant problem before. Do you think there's anything in particular 
about our kernel config that would be causing this to happen?
