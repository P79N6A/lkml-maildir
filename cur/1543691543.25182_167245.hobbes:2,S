I dunno if you were the one posting this issue here some months ago?
Show me a regular kernel path that passes invalid b_reqnext to
__make_request? That would be a bug, indeed, but I've never heard of
such a bug. Most likely it's a bug in your driver, not initialising
b_reqnext. You can see the initialisor for buffer_heads is
init_buffer_head, which memsets the entire buffer_head. When a
buffer_head is detached from the request list, b_reqnext is cleared too.
