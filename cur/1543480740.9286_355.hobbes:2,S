Subject: [REAL pre8] Why is 'wchan' always empty?

Hi,
	I noticed that, beginning with the first testing/pre-8, no processes
are recorded as being stopped in any kernel function (e.g. the 'wchan'
field is empty).  In pre-7, all processes that are in 'S' state have a
'wchan' entry.
'wchan'             
nanosleep         about 6
read_chan         about 7  (lots of getty)
select            about 14 
some random other functions are
bdflush,exit, inet_wait_for_connect,kswapd, pipe_read, syslog, wait4.
Any idea what might have changed this?
