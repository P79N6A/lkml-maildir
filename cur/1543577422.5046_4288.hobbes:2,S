I assume you meant to return -EAGAIN, not -EIO. However, it doesn't
work if the printer is powered off and LP_ABORT is false. In that case
lp_write calls lp_check_status, which detects the error, waits 10
seconds, but then returns 0. lp_write then calls parport_write which
will happily send the data to the powered off printer, then return
success to user space and the data is lost.
