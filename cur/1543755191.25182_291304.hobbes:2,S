Subject: [PATCH 0/8] lib/sort: Add generic sort to lib/

This patch series introduces a generic heapsort function, sort(), in
lib/. It also replaces the uses of the recently introduced qsort()
code from glibc and then removes that code. A few other open-coded
sort routines are updated as well. I plan to clean up some other
effervescent sort routines in the near future.
