It enables some optimisations and mathematical transformations which
do not satisfy the properties of IEEE floating point arithmetic.
(Not that GCC's output satisfies those properties without -ffast-math
on x86, but this flag enables much looser semantics).

They are preserved - they are part of the floating point context.
If there is any failure to preserve all of that context, it's a kernel bug.

Is the hardware *identical*, or are they different x86 CPUs?
Different CPUs give different results for the trigonometric functions.
GCC's manual claims that fsin, fcos and fsqrt instructions are only
used if the -funsafe-math-optimizations flag is also used, if the GCC
version is >= 2.6.1.  However you may find that Glibc's <math.h> ends
up using those instructions when -ffast-math is used alone.
