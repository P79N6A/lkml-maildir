I think you're confusing the Interrupt Line register and the Interrupt 
Pin register.  The Interrupt Line register is platform-dependent, but on 
x86 platforms it generally contains the IRQ number (and IRQ 0 is valid, 
although in practice it is never used since IRQ 0 is the system timer 
and is never connected to the PCI bus), or 255 meaning "none" -- see the 
footnote on page 223 of the PCI 3.0 spec.
