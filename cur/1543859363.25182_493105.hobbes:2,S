I will try, but I had a look around the different architectures
implementation of ptep_clear_flush_dirty() and saw that not all do the
actual flush. So if we go down this road perhaps we should introduce
another per arch function that does the potential flush. like
flush_tlb_on_clear_dirty() or something like that.
Then we could write:
  entry = ptep_get_and_clear(mm, address, ptep)
  flush_tlb_on_clear_dirty(vma, address);
  entry = pte_mkclean(entry);
  entry = pte_wrprotect(entry);
  set_pte_at(mm, address, ptep, entry);

Hmm, should we not flush after clearing the dirty bit? That is, why does
ptep_clear_flush_dirty() need a flush after clearing that bit? does it
leak through in the tlb copy?
Also, what is this page_test_and_clear_dirty() business, that seems to
be exclusively s390 btw. However they do seem to need this.

Yeah, probably, not optimally so on some archs that don't actually need
the flush though. And as above, I wonder about s390.
