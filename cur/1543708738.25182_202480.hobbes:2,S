Hello,
I have experienced an I/O lockup on my dual Xeon server with megaraid adapter 
when kernel was compiled with highmem and highmem i/o. It happened during 
compilation of mysql with no other load.
Then I recompiled the kernel wo/highmem and everything is stable.
As, this server is now in production on different location I cannot do much 
testing except giving detailed hw info.
