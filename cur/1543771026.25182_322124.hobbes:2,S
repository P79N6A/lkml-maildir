The whole point of a nanokernel is it's *small*.  The whole thing can
be formally verified.  And its semantics will provide isolation
between the real-time processes and anything else that's running.
We're currently working on a system called Iguana, which will have
provable WCET for real-time scheduled tasks, and a Linux envionrment
(called `wombat') that provides compatibility for

Except that the nano-kernel is less than one percent of the size.
Both systems does the same thing

This is precisely the approach we (and others) are taking.   A
virtualised Linux to provide interactive and soft realtime (think java
games on your mobile phone), and a nanokernel for your hard realtime
tasks (think the radio controller on your mobile phone).  
See 
http://www.disy.cse.unsw.edu.au/Software/Iguana/
 for our work.
In addition to our work, there's the Adeos system
(
http://www.hyades-itea.org/
) uses a very similar approach.
