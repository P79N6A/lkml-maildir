The problem here (As discussed in private mails) is that the for loop 
assumes that the beginning of given user-space buffer is the beginning
of a rule. This leads to situations where the rule becomes "ecret 20",
or "cret 20" instead of "Secret 20". Big input buffers/files leads 
smack to recieve a rule like "Secret 20" in fragmented chunks like:
write("<lots of rules before ours>\nSec", ..)
write("r", 1, ..)
write("et 20\n<remaing rules after ours>", ..)
Parsing a rule in such tough conditions in _kernel space_ is very
hard. I began to feel that it will be much easier if we do the parsing 
in a userspace utility and let smack accept only small buffers (80 char). 
i.e. A user space utility that takes a big input file like
exit 10/3,7,4
exit 10/3,7,4
exit 10/3,7,4
<100 times>
And transform it to 100 small write() calls. By this way we can return
-EINVAL if write()'s count field > 80, or if input contains no \n or
more than one.
Any Ideas ?. 
Casey, I can begin modifying cipso_write() and writing this small 
user-space utility now if you agree on this.
