Sure, I'm just about to post a new version of IBAC with the changes based on 
comments from the lsm and lkml lists.

You're absolutely correct on all accounts.

Correct. Verifying the integrity of security.selinux xattrs would require 
adding security.selinux to /etc/evm.conf and calls within SELinux to 
integrity_verify_metadata() as needed. Verifying the integrity of files,
would require labeling the files with integrity measurements and
adding calls within SELinux to integrity_verify_data() as needed.

Actually the current EVM implementation as an integrity provider relies on
an LSM module, or for that matter any other kernel module, to make calls 
to the integrity API: integrity_verify_metadata(), integrity_verify_data(), 
and integrity_measure().  The decision as to which files are to be measured
is left up to the LSM module.  For example, as you previously noted, IBAC
only verifies the metadata and data integrity of executables, whereas SLIM 
verifies the metadata and data integrity of SYSTEM level files and all
executables.
