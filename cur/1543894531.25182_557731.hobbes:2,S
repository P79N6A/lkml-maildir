Hello.
I just now made demo movies how TOMOYO Linux looks like.
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/data/CentOS5-install.avi
 is
a movie that demonstrates how to install TOMOYO Linux 1.4.1 on CentOS 5.
http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/data/CentOS5-learning.avi
 is
a movie that demonstrates how the TOMOYO Linux kernel creates domains
and accumulates access requests from scratch using "learning" mode.
Please see CentOS5-install.avi once before seeing CentOS5-learning.avi
to help your understanding.
Although there is no explanation text in the movies for now,
I'm sure you can feel how TOMOYO Linux works.
Thanks.
