That and it doesn't test if the BARs are assigned at all, doesn't
request the resources, etc... 
I'm not sure it's legal to do pci_enable_device() from within a pci
quirk anyway. I really wonder what that code is doing in the quirks, I
don't think it's the right place, but I may be wrong.
What is the logic supposed to be there ?
Ben.
