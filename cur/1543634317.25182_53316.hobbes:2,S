it is a mistake to assume that sched_yield() == 'threaded applications'.
sched_yield() is a horrible interface to base userspace spinlocks on, it's
not in any way cheaper than real blocking, even in the best-case situation
when there is no 'useless' yielding back and forth. In the worst-case
situation it can be a few orders more expensive (!) than blocking-based
solutions. LinuxThread's use of sched_yield() was and remains a hack. I'm 
actually surprised that it works for real applications.
We are trying to improve things as much as possible on the kernel
scheduler side, but since there is absolutely no object/contention
information available for kernel space (why it wants to schedule away,
which other processes are using the blocked object, etc.), it's impossible
to do a perfect job - in fact it's not even possible to do a 'good' job.
IMO people interested in high-performance threading should concentrate on
the lightweight, kernel-backed userspace semaphores patch(es) that have
been presented a few weeks ago, and merge those concepts into LinuxThreads
(or into their own threading/spinlock solutions). Those patches do it
properly, and the scheduler will be able to give all the help it can.
