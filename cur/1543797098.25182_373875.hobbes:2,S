Just so we're all on the same page, I think there are two sets of 
unhappy people here... one is the group who want new stuff fast and 
stable. For the most part that's not me, although I was in the "if 
you're going to add ipw2200 support, why not something that works?" 
group. But new stuff is going in faster than most people can assimilate 
it if they have a real job, so I don't see too much problem there.
The other group is the people who use and depend on some feature, be it 
cryptoloop, 8k stacks, ndiswrapper, ipchains, whatever... which is 
scheduled for extinction. That's a departure from the way 2.{0,2,4} were 
done, where adds happened regularly, but features were only deleted in 
development trees. Deleting features leaves anyone who can't keep their 
own tree without security fixes. I see that as bed, and a far more 
important departure from the old model than the speed of new adds.
