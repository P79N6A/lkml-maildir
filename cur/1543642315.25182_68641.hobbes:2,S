I noticed I perhaps didn't describe the symptoms precisely. It didn't stop
working permanently, the network was going up and down unpredictably, in
intervals of about 5 to 20 minutes. Perhaps there was a pattern, but I hope
you'll excuse me for mot measuring the exact times as the main point was to
get it running, not to write a scientific report about it :-).
If it wasn't fixed by a reboot I'd say it was an odd hardware problem.
