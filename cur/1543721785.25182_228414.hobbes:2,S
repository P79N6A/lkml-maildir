Yes, we do this on parisc too.  We actually have a hidden method pointer
(per platform) and cache the iommu (we have more than one) accessors in
platform_data.
The problem is, though, that I really don't think this interface would
benefit from being made public (or part of the API).  There are too many
nasty quirks in the platform for this (at least in our case).
