It became clear that my previous tests were done with DMA off.  *Why*
that was so is the subject of another post.  However, once I got it
on, I got the following results usings mingo's patch and the
(unmodified) Arcangeli patch:
  1.7ms (  0)|
  6.0ms (  1)|
 29.0ms ( 19)|
 10.1ms ( 15)|
  5.2ms (  0)|
Very nice. :)
