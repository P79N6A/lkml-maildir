Subject: [PATCH] net: fix smc91x build for sh/ppc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/12/177

The current smc91x code uses set_irq_type(). It looks like the m32r guys
worked around this by adding a !defined(__m32r__) check, but this is equally
bogus as set_irq_type() is an arm/arm26-specific function.
Trying to get this to build on sh died in the same spot, so we just back out
the m32r change and make it depend on CONFIG_ARM instead. Notably, the ppc
build would have been broken by this as well, but it doesn't seem like anyone
noticed this there yet.
