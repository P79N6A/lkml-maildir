I overlooked the *failed_swapout, I thought you used only 0 and 1 as
parameters, the new version is fine.
BTW, it would also be cleaner to add a __ in front of the function name,
and to #define a _force version that will pass 1, so you don't have less
readable 0/1 in the caller, but I don't mind even with the status in
version 2 (it's simple enough to understand the semantics of the 0/1).
