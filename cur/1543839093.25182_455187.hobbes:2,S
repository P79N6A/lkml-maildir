which one do you prefer:
- having a pointer on the struct page?
  kernels without resource accounting won't have this.
- having a mirroring mem_map?
  on i686 it is easy, but not sure about sparse mem
  or numa configurations.
  advantage: run-time configurable on boot time.
  disadvantage: much lower performance with accounting.
- address_space/anon_vma can be replaced with some kind of proxy object
  with 2 pointers - address_space and ub. however I don't see how it is
  better then a single ptr on page.
Thanks,
Kirill
