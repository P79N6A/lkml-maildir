I do the following when I am working on the NTFS driver:
1st: make mrproper && make menuconfig && make dep && make bzImage && make 
modules && make modules_install
2nd: install new kernel, lilo, reboot into new kernel
3rd: edit the <mymodule>'s source.
4th: make modules && make modules_install && depmod -a && rmmod <mymodule> 
&& modprobe <mymodule>
5th: do testing I wanted to do.
6th go to 3rd step and repeat until satisfied with result.
[NB. Obviously replacing <mymodule> with the module name of whatever I am 
looking at.
NB. I have put this in a few convenience scripts...]
This procedure works fine, or at least it does so for all modules I have 
tried it with (which isn't many, since I only keep NTFS, md and linear as 
modules...).
HTH,
         Anton
