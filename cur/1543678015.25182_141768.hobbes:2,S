Hm!  I wonder.  Robert is working on a fix for schedsetschedule() 
where it fails to actually tell the scheduler to switch to a process 
that it just made higher priority or away from one it just lowered.
The net result is that the caller keeps running (FIFO for all in this 
case) when, in fact it should have been switched out.  Next time 
schedule() actually switches, it is all sorted out again.  Could the 
elavation of the events/0 thread cause this needed switch?
