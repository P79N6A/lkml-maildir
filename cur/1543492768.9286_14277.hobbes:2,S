Sorry, what happens instead is that Linux is put on the network to test
it, cannot talk to the Sun box (or whatever the particular problem is) and
rather then scrapping all the Sun boxes the Linux box is pulled off the
network (and probably never given another chance).
If Linux does not work well with other buggy OS's Linux does not get
deployed. The number of Linux only shops is very small, but due to the
compatability of linux the number of linux boxes that are deployed in what
would otherwase be a Sun only or AIX only shop is large.

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
