That's cool, long as everybody agrees on that - I've already filled my career
quota of chasing down bugs due to non-threadsafe use of str*() functions. ;)
All the same, I'd probably feel better if it used strncpy() instead - there'd
still be the possibility of copying now-stale data, but at least you'd not be
able to walk off the end of the *new* array's allocated space....
