Not much is left from these changes if one wants to stay within
"reasonable and compilable". :-)  Anyway, even after this compiles my
Nautilus boxes still do not boot nor show any inclinations to inform why
they are unhappy.
At the very bottom of arch/alpha/kernel/setup.c one can find the
following:
static int alpha_panic_event(struct notifier_block *this,
                             unsigned long event,
                             void *ptr)
{
#if 1
        /* FIXME FIXME FIXME */
        /* If we are using SRM and serial console, just hard halt here. */
        if (alpha_using_srm && srmcons_output)
                __halt();
#endif
        return NOTIFY_DONE;
}
After I changed "#if 1" to "#if 0" results were that most of the time,
although not always, after aboot loader messages I was sooner or later
quietly back at SRM prompt and yes - "srmcons" was given in boot flags.
On some occasions an attempt to boot would simply lock up.  To be sure
this was happening both with CONFIG_ALPHA_LEGACY_START_ADDRESS set
and not set.
Anybody with some ideas where I should really look?
