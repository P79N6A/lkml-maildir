Although a IO action can benefit several processes, there is one that
creates the request. If another process needs the same page while the
first request has not been completed, its priority can be raised.

It would be more fair to make the priority of a process that makes less IO
higher. In this way, an interactive user that opens an editor is less
bothered by an application that makes intensive access.
It gives more stability against a bogus application that takes too much
memory.
In order to avoid a denial of service, Linux could implement per session
or per uid limits.

But this case is the exception, not the rule. The normal behaviour of the
system should be optimized for the most frequent case. To handle the
exception, the process can tell the kernel by raising its priority.
For instance, an unpriviledged application could be allowed to raise
its priority for a limited time, so that it can, for instance, save the
document and exit faster.
