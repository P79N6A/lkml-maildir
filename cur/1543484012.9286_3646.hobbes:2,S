If you're only running NIS, you shouldn't use both nisplus and nis -
just nis is enough.

As already mentioned in this thread:
glibc 2.1 will contain the Name Service Cache daemon `nscd' which caches 
all excesses.  Get 2.1 when it's out (or a prerelease) and run nscd -
and you should be happy again.
