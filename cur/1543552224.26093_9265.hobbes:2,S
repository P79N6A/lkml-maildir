I think I may have found a bug in the kernel, and wish to verify this by
testing this with the "latest" kernel. In order that I make a valid bug
report, which kernel would be considered to be good for testing on? Is it the
latest *stable* version (now 2.2.17, I believe); or is it one of the 2.4.*
test kernels (now 2.4.test9)? Which one would a bug report be taken seriously?
