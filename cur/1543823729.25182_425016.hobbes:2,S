Still scary on a laptop.  I'm not sure what else can be damaged in there.
It's quite tight.

I posted on the suspend2 mailing list, but I haven't had a response there.

Yeah, that probably is so.  I never let my system cool down before I
rebooted, without the patch, so it was probably still hot.  It was the
only thing that I saw. And when I removed it the temperature dropped. It
probably had more to do with the time since running hot.
I never had a problem before adding the suspend2 patch. Afterwards, I
noticed that my battery life was shortening, and then suddenly I started
to get warnings after compiling the kernel.  But it would take some time
(sometimes hours) to get hot to scream.  But this only happened with the
suspend2 patch.  I've been running without that patch for a few days now
and the CPU runs very cool.  Right now it's at 44C. (I haven't started
compiling kernels yet).
