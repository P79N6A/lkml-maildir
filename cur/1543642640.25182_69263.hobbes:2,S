And it's not a good way to drive module unloading.  It is rmmod that
should cause a module to be unloaded, not close.  The final close
*allows* the module to be unloaded, it does not *cause* it to be.  So
to get the expected behaviour, you have to lather on some other fanciful
construction to garbage collect modules ready to be unloaded, or to let
rmmod inquire the state of the module in the process of attempting to
unload it, and not trigger the nasty races we've discussed.  Enter
fancy locking regime that 3 people in the world actually understand.
