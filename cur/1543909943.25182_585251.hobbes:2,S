Okay. I found what was different. It does actually build, but it
is now put into a completely different directory, 
/lib/modules/2.6.22.1/kernel/drivers/hid/usbhid, and requires
/lib/modules/2.6.22.1/kernel/drivers/input/ff-memless.ko
to be installed before it can be. None of this is documented
and it makes upgrading extremely difficult, expecially when a
keyboard won't work anymore.
BYW, it did fix the problem with the old driver.
Cheers,
