Please don't send out the partial kthread conversions, as they're not
that helpful.  Depending on the way we'll let the API evolve a
kthread_create/run not paired by a kthread_stop might be actually harmful.
Please only send along patches that are paired or always built in so that
they don't require stopping at all.
Btw, many of the drivers above should probably go to benh.
There's probably a few more patches falling into this category, these
were just the first one the stick into my eye.
