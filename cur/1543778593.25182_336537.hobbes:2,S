That's not the same. The apps on my computer right now should not assume
that I have 100 priorities.  Since I'm free to work with any kernel that
I want.  The customers that ask for a custom kernel are also writing
custom apps for a specific product.  Things can be assumed more since
the apps are not generic tools that are running on desktops.  In fact,
some of these apps require special hardware to work (at least a driver
to imitate the hardware).
