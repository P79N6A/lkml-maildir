Wait, my testing caught this.  I made the change to the patch myself,
adding the needed conversion to my tree, it's here, on my disk!
Oh crap, I never checked it in.
/me goes off to sulk in shame.
Very sorry about this, totally my fault, I knew this needed to be fixed,
fixed it, but it didn't propogate to the tree to send to Linus.
I suck.  I need a vacation and an empty inbox.
I'll be sending fixup patches for this and other merge messes in a few
hours, once the coffee has kicked in...
