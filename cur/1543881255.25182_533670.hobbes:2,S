Sure.
Should I add a link to my patch on the "CONFIG PREEMPT RT Patch" page?
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_Patch#Download
e.g. in the "Download" section, something along the lines of:
"An updated version of the CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT patch (cleanly applies to
kernel 2.6.20.7) is also available."
I should probably mention that is not an officially sanctioned version,
and that it has not received the same scrutiny as other patches?
Regards.
