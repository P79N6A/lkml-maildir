Yes that was MB/s, the data was taken in KB a set of 3 zeros where missing.

We'll give it a try.  I'm on travel right now so it may be a few days if 
Richard doesn't get to before I get back.

Soon after we finish beating the ext3 file system up I'll take a swing 
at some other file systems.

No, the IO block write throughput for the system goes down as drives are 
added under this work load.  We measure the system throughput not the 
per drive throughput, but one could infer the per drive throughput by 
dividing.
Running bonnie++ on with 300MB files doing 8Kb sequential writes we get 
the following system wide throughput as a function of the number of 
drives attached and by number of addapters.  
One addapter                           
1 drive per addapter    127,702KB/Sec
2 drives per addapter  93,283 KB/Sec
6 drives per addapter   85,626 KB/Sec
2 addapters
1 drive per addapter    92,095 KB/Sec
2 drives per addapter  110,956 KB/Sec
6 drives per addapter   106,883 KB/Sec
4 addapters
1 drive per addapter    121,125 KB/Sec
2 drives per addapter   117,575 KB/Sec
6 drives per addapter   116,570 KB/Sec
Not too pritty.
