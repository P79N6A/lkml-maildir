Subject: ftp.xx.kernel.org mirrors?  Why passive mode?

Just a quick question, out of curiosity...  the kernel.org mirrors are
EXCELLENT but why am I forced to use passive mode on the two I have tried?
(ca and us)...  in fact, ca.kernel.org regularly doesn't even get to the
login prompt.
I *am* behind IP Masquerading but I can connect fine to MANY other sites,
including the original ftp.kernel.org.  The masqueradiing box has the
ip_masq_ftp module loaded. 
Is there some magic reason why passive mode is enforced?
