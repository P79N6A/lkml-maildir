Yes, it is repeatable with your previous patch.  But with your most
recent patch I had the following after shutdown:
# mdadm -X /dev/nbd0 /dev/sdq
        Filename : /dev/nbd0
          Events : 1732
  Events Cleared : 1732
          Bitmap : 409600 bits (chunks), 1 dirty (0.0%)
        Filename : /dev/sdq
          Events : 1736
  Events Cleared : 1736
          Bitmap : 409600 bits (chunks), 1 dirty (0.0%)
Unfortunately sdq's events_cleared appears to have been updated
_after_ the array became degraded.
As such a full resync occurred because 1732 < 1736.

Before, events_cleared was _not_ updated if the array was degraded.
Your patch doesn't appear to maintain that design.
I tried adding the following degraded check to your below conditional
but that resulted in nbd0's events < mddev->bitmap->events_cleared
again, so I'm back to square one:
                        if (!bitmap->mddev->degraded &&
                            bitmap->events_cleared < bitmap->mddev->events) {
In addition no bits were set in sdq's bitmap:
# mdadm -X /dev/nbd0 /dev/sdq
        Filename : /dev/nbd0
          Events : 2616
  Events Cleared : 2617
          Bitmap : 409600 bits (chunks), 0 dirty (0.0%)
        Filename : /dev/sdq
          Events : 2618
  Events Cleared : 2617
          Bitmap : 409600 bits (chunks), 0 dirty (0.0%)

I needed "bitmap->mddev->sb_wait" and "bitmap->mddev->flags" to get
the code to compile.
