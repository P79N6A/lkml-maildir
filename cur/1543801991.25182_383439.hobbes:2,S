Ah good!
Can you test the _PDC patch here all by itself?
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5483#c17
If this patch is what causes the failure, please 
build with CONFIG_ACP_DEBUG=y and attach the dmesg
from the failure, as well as the output from acpidump,
available in the latest pmtools here:
