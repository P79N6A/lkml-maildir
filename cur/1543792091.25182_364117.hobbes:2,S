Surely it depends on the Radeon. I get perfectly respectable numbers on
my Radeon 9250 (purchased because Dave Airlie said it was well-supported
by X.org :) ). It's not exactly Doom-playing quality, but it's good
enough for everything I'm doing with it, and it only cost thirty quid:
for that price you can afford to try it and see :)
(Later Radeons' 3D aren't fully supported yet in free drivers, as far as
I know.)
