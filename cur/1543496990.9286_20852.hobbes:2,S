Hello.
I'm not sure that i'm gonna tell about the same problem (haven't seen
the beginning of this thread).
I have a terrible problem with my SCSI MO drive since (2.2.2, in 2.2.1
it was working ok).

My MO media is double sided (each side 625M). but when formating ext2fs
under  >2.2.1 it seems that mke2fs interprets one side of MO disk as
1250M (it gets block count two times larger than it is).
i still can format it under >2.2.1 (if the real number of blocks is
explicitly specified in mke2fs command line options). but when i try to
mount it under earlier kernel - i get an error (usually bad superblock)
disks formatted under earlier kernels simply could not be mounted under
>2.2.1.
so there is some incompatibility. I wonder what has changed since 2.2.1
that caused all this problems.

me too.
