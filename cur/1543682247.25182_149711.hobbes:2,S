I tend to think the creation/destruction will be the most noticeable
performance difference in practice. allocating 42G in a single block
will take a bit of time ;). I'm not necessairly worse or unacceptable,
but it's different. And I feel I've to retain the bigpages= API (as an
API not as in implementation) anyways. Furthmore I'm unsure if hugtlbfs
is relaxed like the shm-largpeage patch is, I mean, it should be
possible to mmap the stuff with 4k granularty too, or stuff could break
due that change of API too.
