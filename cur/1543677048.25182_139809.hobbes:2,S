Its not very critical. It is used to estimate how many
requests will take t ms to complete, based on how many
requests we sent last time around, and how long that
took.
As long as it increment when we were below estimate and
decrement when above it should be OK. The mul/div were
put there in order to adapt more quickly to changes in
the request pattern.
You would think that if a batch of 10 requests took
twice as long as we wanted, we might as well submit 5
requests, but in testing I found that this makes the
numbers jump around too much, while a 3* threshold
smoothed it over while still adapting to changes nicely.
