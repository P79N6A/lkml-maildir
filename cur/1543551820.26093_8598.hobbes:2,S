dn[i], i++ evaluates to i, but str[i] = dn[i], i++ sets str[i] to
dn[i] first, then increments i returning its previous value, which is
discarded. Which was probably specified this way so
for(i=1,j=2; something; something else)
works as expected, rather than setting i and j to 2, and discarding
the 1.
Just to encourage empiricism, I usually check stuff like that with
% cat > foo.c
main(){
int i;
i = 1 , 2;
printf("%d\n",i);
}
% gcc foo.c
% ./a.out
1
or similar if I'm confused.
