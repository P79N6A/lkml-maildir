Hi Linus,
This patch does the following:
	- Remove CONFIG_SMP as the compiler will optimize
	  the code away anyway (smp_num_cpus == 1 in UP).
	- Make power off under SMP work again.
	- Fix thinko with initial engaging of BIOS.
	- Make sure power off only happens on CPU 0.
	- Do error notification to user mode if BIOS calls fail.
	- Move entrypoint offset fix to ...boot/setup.S
	  where it belongs.
	- Remove smp-power-off. SMP users must now specify
	  "apm=power-off" on the kernel command line.
	- Register the /proc/apm entry even on SMP so that
	  scripts that check for it before doing power off work.
	- Changes for new pm_ interfaces.
And just what everyone has been waiting for :-)
	- Modularize the code.
