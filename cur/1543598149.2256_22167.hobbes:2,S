i would _think_ its just too unrelated.  even if we can understand the
wireless transmission, the correlation between what is sent and how the
IRQs are triggered is probably pretty vague.
then you have the whole issue of skew between times, etc.

yep, entropy is gathered as the difference (delta value) between
different registered events.  so far, irqs are used.  i think the way
the block devices work is seperate, too. they dont work off irqs per se
(but if a block device has hardware behind it, its irqs can add entropy
on top of the block device functions).

CPU temp is not a bad idea.  the RNG built into the i810/i815/i820
chipsets is like your diode example -- a chip measures some sort of
flucuations over the PCI bus.  quantum physics says that is truly
unpredictable :)

(a) is why we need more sources of entropy, like my network patch or
your loopback idea
(b) is debatable. i disagree it poses any true threat to the system.
i dont think temperature probes would have that much noise.  i suppose
if they were precise enough you could use the least significant bits,
but what really matters is how much of that precision is exported via
its interface. i suppose the lsb may be useful.
what i think we really need it to audit more drivers and, of those that
would be "entropic", have them contributed to the entropy pool.
