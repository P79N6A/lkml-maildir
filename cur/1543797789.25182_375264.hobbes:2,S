It's completely reproducable here when booting the kernel with  vga=normal
and then starting X with the attached xorg.conf using this grahics card :

note that if I use a fb console everything is fine, only when booting
initially with vga=normal is there a problem.

Both were set. Commenting out both didn't change a thing.

I'm already using the vesa driver. It seems to be the only Open Source
driver that'll work with this card, so i don't have any other to try.

Since this is 2.6.15-rc5-mm2 I grabbed these two instead:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.15-rc5/2.6.15-rc5-mm2/broken-out/vgacon-fix-doublescan-mode.patch
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.15-rc5/2.6.15-rc5-mm2/broken-out/vgacon-workaround-for-resize-bug-in-some-chipsets.patch
Reverting both patches didn't fix the problem. Starting X then
switching back to a text mode console still results in a completely
messed up text console. X is fine, I can switch back to it no problem,
but text consoles go bye-bye...
Would there be any point in trying a kernel with just one of the
patches reverted?
