That's not the whole story.
All the drivers I've tried will work if compiled with USE_IO_OPS
defined, but will behave badly under load. That is, when heavily loaded
they will lock up and reset after a several-second timeout expires. This
is true for Becker's 1.09 driver, the latest in-kernel driver, and
Edward Peng's napi sundance driver. (With the exception that the napi
driver doesn't recover after it locks up). Peng's driver is at
http://edward
_peng.tripod.com/, and his email address from the dl2k
driver indicates that he works for Dlink.
I looked on dlink's web and ftp sites, but was unable to find any linux
driver for the DFE-580TX. How did you find it?
