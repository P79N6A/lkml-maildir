Anyone else have trouble fitting this patch ???.
I see a later version today, but not markedly different from this
mornings (Aus time). Initially I thought I had the first version, prior
to Balbir's RSS controller V2 re-write, but apparently not.
Kernel 2.6.20.1
Had to toss it away so I could do some base line testing - I'll redo the
build and see where the mis-matches are.
