Hmm, you might do something like
	while (sys_kill(pid, SIGTERM) != -1)
		schedule();
It is ugly because it depends on PID not being reused, but it might
work after all.
Wait. In what context process does cleanup_module() code run? It is
probably not safe to do blocking call in idle task or something
similary bad.

PS: Is someone working on audio-for-USB?
