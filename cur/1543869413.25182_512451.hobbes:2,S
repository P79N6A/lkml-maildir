Sorry I'm late to the party, just climbed through 2000 mails.
I do hope you'll manage an -rc2,
I seem not the only one to notice wanted patches missing.
There's two from 2.6.19-stable that I thought Chris had agreed
for 2.6.18-stable (Linus' mincore and my read_zero_pagealigned);
two that I sent Chris cc stable for 2.6.18-stable on 4th January
(msync and powerpc current); one I know about from 2.6.19-stable
equally desirable in 2.6.18-stable (Badari's shmem_truncate); and
a new one I was waiting to appear in 2.6.21-rc1 before sending
(Tigran's extN noacl umask).
I'm reassembling the six patches against 2.6.18.8-rc1 for these
now (plus a 2.6.19-stable and a 2.6.20-stable for the latter),
will send them to Greg cc stable shortly.
I wonder whether Chris has a tree somewhere, or a mailbox,
containing further goodies which have been missed.
Hugh
