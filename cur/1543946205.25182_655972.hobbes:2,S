That would assume trains are always 60ft long, which is the basic error in 
your assumption.
Since we're using analogies: What you're doing is to put you winter 
clothes on your weight scale and reset the scale to zero to offset for the 
weigth of the clothes. If you stand now with your bathing clothes on the 
scale, does that mean you lost weight?
That's all you do - you change the scale and slightly screw the scale for 
everyone else trying to use it.
To keep in mind what time adjusting is supposed to do:
	freq = 1sec + time_freq
What we do instead is:
	freq + tick_adj = 1sec + time_freq
Where exactly is now the problem to integrate tick_adj into time_freq? The 
result is _exactly_ the same. The only visible difference is a slightly 
higher time_freq value and as long as it is within the 500 ppm limit there 
is simply no problem.

How exactly does CLOCK_TICK_ADJUST address this problem? The error due to 
insufficient resolution is still there, all it does is shifting the scale, 
so it's not immediately visible.

What exactly is hurt?
