I was afraid of that.  ;-)

And if we have a hash on the output, conflicting updates to the state
should be tolerable as well.  Still want per-CPU state in order to
avoid cache thrashing, of course, but should be able to avoid preemption
disabling.  So the trick will be getting a performance/size/entropy
tradeoff that 75% of the current roll-your-own random-number-generator
uses can live with.
						Thanx, Paul
