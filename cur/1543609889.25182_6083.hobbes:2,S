Hi All,
 I believe in the 2.4.x kernel LAN drivers can ask for scattered buffers on transmit. Is that what the NETIF_F_SG parm talks about? 
 Also, on the receive side, is buffer chaining possible? ie, if the device gives us 2 buffers (for a single frame), can the driver send those 2 buffers directly to the OS or should the driver combine it into a single buffer before calling netif_rx ()
thanx
