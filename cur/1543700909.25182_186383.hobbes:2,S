Hi,
I'm running Linux 2.4.23-ben1 of 3 days ago (rsync'd) on an iBook G4 800.
As I tried to mount a CD created in OS X with
mount -t hfs /dev/scd0 /cdrom
I got this message:
kernel BUG at buffer.c:2570!
verctor: 0 at pc = c00452e8, lr = c00452e8
msr = 9032, sp = cb5e5cc0 [cb5e5bf8]
current = cb5e4000, pid = 876, comm = mount
mon>
This bug is reproducable too (tried it).
I don't have access to an installed Intel machine right now, so I don't know 
if it's PPC specific.
regards,
Adriaan
