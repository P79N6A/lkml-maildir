Yes, I find it hard to improve the boot time of the init.d stage.
However, it is perfectly ok to preload all GUI staffs during that
timespan, by overlapping CPU/IO activities.

You are right, reducing seeking distances helps not much. My fluxbox
desktop requires near 3k seeks, which can be loaded in the 20s init.d
booting time.  But for KDE/GNOME desktops, some defragging would be
necessary to fit them into the 20s time span.
I found ext3 to be rather good filesystem to support poor man's defrag
described by Chris Mason:

        This certainly can help.  Based on some ideas from andrea I
        made a poor man's defrag script last year that was similar.
        It worked by copying files into a flat dir in the order you
        expected to read them in, deleting the original, then hard
        linking them into their original name.
Make the 'flat dir' as an top level dir would do the trick for ext3.
We have good chance to merge 10k seeks into 3k seeks by this trick :)
