When I boot Linux I receive the following message:
pcibios_init : BIOS32 Service Directory structure at 0x000fff70
pcibios_init : BIOS32 Service Directory entry at 0xfcdc5
pcibios_init : ERROR : BIOS32 Service Directory says PCI BIOS is present,
        but PCI_BIOS_PRESENT subfunction fails with present status of 0xb1
        and signature of 0x00000289   mail drew@Colorado.EDU
pci_init: no BIOS32 detected
Does anyone have any idea what this means? I have tried the RedHat Mail
list and the email address and have had no response. I haven't had any
problems with crashes, with the exception of ZGV, but I think that is a
video driver problem. 
Thanks,
Keith
