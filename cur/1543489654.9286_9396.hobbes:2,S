Hi,
A while back, someone (name lost) posted a url to schedctl.c which
does the same thing but can start a job in whatever scheduler mode.
	schedctl --rr --pri n command args
I use this tool to prevent skipping with both mpg123 and mpg123-nas
when stress testing.  (used mostly for starting vmstat 1 and such)
I found that if I use the nas server and nas version of mpg123 both
set rr and set to the same priority, they interfere with each other
badly.  The kernel gripes constantly with..
	Sound: DMA (output) timed out - IRQ/DRQ config error?
If I set the nas server to priority x and mpg123.nas to priority y,
all is well.  Is this normal rr behavior?
(in any case, it might be useful for folks to know that setting both
 client and server to the same rr priority generates skippity-skip)
	-Mike
