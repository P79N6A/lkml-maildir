Interfacing an X1900 graphics card to FreeBSD and interfacing an X1900
graphics card to Linux are two different ideas. They are *not* two
expressions of the same idea.

These are all diferent ideas. Scenes a faire applies to how you express a
given idea, not other ideas you could possibly express. (This is explicitly
addressed in the decision.)
Otherwise, there would be no scenes a faire. Perhaps you cannot make a
western without a shootout at high noon, but you can make a romance.
