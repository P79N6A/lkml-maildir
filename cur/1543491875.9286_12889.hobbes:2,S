Does anyone know how to limit the amount of disk cache used by Linux?
Before everyone says, "No! You don't want to do that! That's bad!" Let me
explain my situation.
I have a RAID that has its own disk cache, and I receive much better
performance if I let my RAID handle the caching and have Linux leave it
alone.
I'm using the Linux 2.2.5 kernel.
I've experimented with /proc/sys/vm, but any changes I make there don't seem
to have any effect on actual caching.
Can anyone help?
