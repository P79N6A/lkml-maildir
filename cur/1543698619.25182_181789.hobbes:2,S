I've got the A10 bios as well, and the system boots and works fine
with 2.4.22 + DM patch.  I don't think there's a newer BIOS available
either, so that route is out.
I did work on getting this system to boot at one point under the early
2.6.0-test series, but it was unstable so I fell back to 2.4.2x and
I've been there since.  
It's also a very upto date Debian unstable/testing system as well.  
I've looked at the bugzilla notes, but nothing really pokes out at
me.  I guess my next test is to try to compile/boot without SMP turned
on.
