My thought was something like:
/* This is an empty struct for !CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK. */
static struct cpuvar_with_mutex_fallback fallback;
...
	cpumask_var_t tmp;
	cpuvar_alloc_fallback(&tmp, &fallback);
	...
	cpuvar_free_fallback(tmp, &fallback);
We may get there eventually, but so far I've managed to produce
less horrendous code in every case.
Cheers,
Rusty.
