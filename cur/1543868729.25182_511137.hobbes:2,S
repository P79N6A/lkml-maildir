see:  
http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-html40-970917/convent.html,
 particularly
how deprecated is defined "outdated by newer constructs," meaning that
there is a better alternative available *now* and not just on the way.
i can always change the wording in the patch, but if we get any more
pedantic, we're going to be counting how many angels you can get on
a split hair.
