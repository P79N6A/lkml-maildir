Hmmm....a 3985W that uses the 7883 device ID should never get there.  The
switch statement that enloses that code says:
          switch(temp_p->chip & AHC_CHIPID_MASK)
          {
            default:
              break;
            case AHC_AIC7895:
            case AHC_AIC7896:
            case AHC_AIC7899:
		.....
	  }
So, as you can see, the change you made shouldn't make a difference.  Now, if
you have one of the later model 3985 cards that uses the 7895 chipset, then
this all makes perfect sense.  In any case, I've modified the current driver
with the following:
/*
 * On some machines, enabling the external SCB RAM isn't reliable yet.  I
 * haven't had time to make test patches for things like changing the
 * timing mode on that external RAM either.  Some of those changes may
 * fix the problem.  Until then though, we default to external SCB RAM
 * off and give a command line option to enable it.
 */
static int aic7xxx_scbram = 0;
and I modified the code inside the switch statement to honor this global
variable that the setup code can modify.  That should solve your problem and
will be in the next official release.
