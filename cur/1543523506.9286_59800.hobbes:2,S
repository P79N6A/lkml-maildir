I apologize to ntpd... hwclock from util-linux-2.10d is the offender (I
hope that 2.10e will come soon). For TZ=CET-1CEST it sets tz to { -120, 0},
for TZ=GMT-1 it does { -60, 0}... So I switched to GMT-1, reloaded system
time from RTC and switched back to CET-1CEST. Now time works as one
expects...
                                                Best regards,
                                                        Petr Vandrovec

P.S.: If it used { -120, non-zero } for CET-1CEST, I could understand it, 
but { -120, 0 } ? Forget it...
