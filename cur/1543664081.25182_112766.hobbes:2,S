Really good AI is predicated on the invention of better algorithms. I do a
bit of work in this area; we're a long way from any useful AI -- unless you
think Microsoft's "Clippy" qualifies. :)
I would love to see "intelligence" in software; IBM's recent "autonomic
computing" initiative is marketing hype for a good idea. Programs (including
Linux!) should be self-diagnosing, fault tolerant, and self-correcting.
We're not there yet on the software side (again).
And "smart AI" may not be something people want. Many people distrust
machines -- and in gaming, a really good AI simply isn't as important (or
desirable) as are pretty graphics (handled by a GPU).

Yeah! ;)

I've worked with several game companies; AI just isn't a priority. Games
need to be "good enough" to challenge average gamers; people who want a real
challenge play online against other humans.
Excellent breast physics (Extreme Beach Volleyball) sells games; a crafty,
hard-to-defeat AI actually turns off casual players and just isn't "sexy".
And now I think we're getting *WAY* off topic. :)
