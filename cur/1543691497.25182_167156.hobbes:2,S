Okay, I traced through all this.  The directory is never explicitly created; 
Red Hat's /sbin/installkernel calls /sbin/new-kernel-pkg, and deep in the 
bowels of that there's a call to depmod:
doDepmod() {
    [ -n "$verbose" ] && echo "running depmod for $version"
    depmod -ae -F /boot/System.map-$version $version
}
And I had the old depmod because rusty's modutils installed themselves in 
/usr/local/bin, and I fixed things up by hand (missing depmod).  I just did a 
reinstall of rusty's modutils with --prefix=/ and we'll see if that fixes 
things on the next kernel upgrade.
It's still kind of a nasty side effect if you ask me.  I thought depmod was 
run AFTER the modules were installed, not to create the directory for them to 
install into.  (My chances of figuring this one out on my own in a finite 
amount of time were pretty low.)
