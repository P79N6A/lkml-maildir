I've had a private email from someone pointing out the same thing. It
was not intended to emphasise the fact that it is static, I'm not sure
if thats the "right thing" or not, but either way, it doesn't actually
need to be static, so that I've agreed that I'll remove the static and
just leave it as const and fix the indenting at the same time,
Steve.
