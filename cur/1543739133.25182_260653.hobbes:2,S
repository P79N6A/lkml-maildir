I don't know about any RPM for that (using a non-rpm based distribution), 
but what I do personally is use "make mandocs" and "make installmandocs".
If you run "make help" in the kernel source tree you'll see this bit:
[...]
Documentation targets:
  Linux kernel internal documentation in different formats:
  sgmldocs (SGML), psdocs (Postscript), pdfdocs (PDF)
  htmldocs (HTML), mandocs (man pages, use installmandocs to install)
[...]
As you see you can get docs in various forms.
Hope that helps.
