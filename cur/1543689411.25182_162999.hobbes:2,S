Hi
I have a Laptop (Clevo is its brand) which has ACPI (I don't know if he
follow the standards).
With some kernels before I was able to see a /proc/acpi directory with
some information (most of them wrong, but ok) and I was able to shutdown
the laptop properly.
With kernel 2.4.22 the /proc/acpi directory does not exist (but I've
compiled it) and modules ac.o, battery.o and so on give a 'init_module:
No such device' answer.
I need to make it turn off automatically again, at least. I know I can
use my last kernel, but it is not quite a good idea, as I would like to
continue updating my kernel.
Thanks for any help 
(please cc me in reply, as I'm not a member of the list)
