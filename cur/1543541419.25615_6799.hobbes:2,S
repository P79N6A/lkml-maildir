Does the SCSI subsystem in the 2.4 series support more than 8 logical units
cleanly?  SCSI-3 defines the LUN to be a 64-bit field, with interpretation
up to the target device type.  I haven't yet run across any device really
using a full 64-bits of LUN, but some RAID controllers support > 32 LUNs.
The qlogicfc driver supports up to 128 LUNs.
