What about earlier kernels?
Please try to narrow down the problem to a specific kernel version.

Don't know about 2.6.0-2.6.9, but 2.4.31 is ok.
Bartlomiej,
When you compare 2.4.31 with 2.6.12 don't you see this problem on your
machine?
If you have a fast system the slowdown won't show, but your IOWAIT will be
higher anyway!
It feels like running on PIO instead of DMA.
