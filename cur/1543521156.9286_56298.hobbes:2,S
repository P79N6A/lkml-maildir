Subject: sendfile and aio_write: a match made in heaven?

khttpd is a fine way to get fast static file http performance, but one
shouldn't need to write code in the kernel to handle such a simple task.
sendfile() plus the new sigio stuff gets user programs most of the way towards
doing what khttpd does, but when sendfile() has to read from disk,
it blocks; this kills server performance.  You can put the sendfile() in a 
worker thread, but it'd be nice if there was another way to deal with this.
The aio_write interface could be extended to handle this
by adding two new fields to struct aiocb:
   int  aio_filedes2;
   off_t aio_offset2;
These would only be checked if the aio_buf field were NULL,
in which case aio_write would cause bytes to be transferred
from aio_filedes2 to aio_filedes1. 
This could potentially fit in very, very nicely with the new sigio stuff;
it would be AFAICS a drop-in replacement for synchronous sendfile()
in a sigio-style server.
