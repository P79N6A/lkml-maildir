Not the problem of the kernel. If you can build your whole system
manually, you also know how to use Google.

Replying again: Depends on distribution. (On Debian: apt-get install
docbook docbook-dsssl).

Distributions tend to package these kind of projects. DocBook is one of
the projects that has been packaged by the distributions. GCC is
another project.

DocBook is not necessary to *build* the kernel. It's only used to make
nicely formatted documents from the comments already in the kernel
source or to make nicely formatted documents from the source of the
books in Documentation/DocBook/. If you don't have DocBook available,
that doesn't make the kernel less portable, all documentation is
available in a human readable format.
