It seems that OOM killer doesn't work in 2.4.19-pre2-ac4 and 2.4.19-pre3-ac1.
I try to load alot of apps (KDE apps + JBuilder) as much as possible until
swap free = 0. At this time, if I try to load a big enough app (KDE Media in
my case), kernel should start OOM killer. But 2.4.19-pre-ac didn't, it try to
.... swap ;), kswapd runs like crazy (30%-40%CPU), disk access continuously,
and whole system is un-interractive => push restart button after 1 hour
waiting for OOM kill.
Behavior of some kernels in this case:
- 2.4.19-pre3: Start OOM killer to kill SOME java processes (JBuilder) before
KDE Media starts and continue to kill all re-spawned java processes. System
is slow down but still interactivable and back to normal status if close some
apps.
- 2.4.19-pre-aa: Start OOM killer to kill ALL java processes (JBuilder) or
kill KDE Media immediately. System is still interactivable.
- 2.4.19-pre-ac: kswapd try to swap out and access disk continuously. Whole
system is slow down and un-interactivable.
HTH,
