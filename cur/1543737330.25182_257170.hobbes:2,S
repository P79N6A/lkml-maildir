Alan, my first reaction was "that's just a buggy driver", but looking at 
the reason for it (telling the device at the other end to change it's 
speed), it's clearly not the driver. The new spinlock is just wrong.
We might be able to change it to a per-tty semaphore instead, which sounds 
reasonably safe, but in the meantime I don't think we have any other 
choice than to just leave the driver/ldisc routines unprotected. They 
should be just reading the state, after all.
I'm committing this temporary fix..
