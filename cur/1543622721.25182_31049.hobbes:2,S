Are there any known problems with this particular VIA chipset, or VIAs in 
general?  I'm noticing extremely slow disk access on boot.  Haven't run any 
benchmarks against my other MBs (which all have Intel chipsets), but the 
"loading kernel...." stage is noticeably slower, and fsck takes about 3-4 
times as long as it does on other MBs.  I'm running kernel 2.4.17.
Thanks....
