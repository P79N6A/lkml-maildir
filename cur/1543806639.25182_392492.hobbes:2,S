Shouldn't actively developed applications use the current methods for
accessing ddevices on target operating systems.  It seems to me that
linux/gnu users are moving away from cdrecord and it ilk because of
the artificial limitations imposed by its libscg counterpart. 
Backward compatibility is being phased out in the linux kernel to
allow for better ways to access and use devices in the system.  While
the technical nature of transport specifications might be tracked down
to an underlying SCSI mechanism, it is by no means an exclusive deal. 
Perhaps linux doesn't need cdrecord and this whole mess will go away.
Real users don't care as long as it works, even the old kernel used
/dev/* names.
Give it up.
