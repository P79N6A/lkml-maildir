I agree that there are a fair number of things (like the sysfs calls)  
that should just WARN() when they hit an error, but I also think that  
we're currently missing a *lot* of __must_check's that we should  
have.  For example a friend of mine was having problems with an HDAPS  
patch where it just kind of hung.  Turns out the problem was that the  
code blithely called scsi_execute_async() and then put itself to  
sleep on a completion... except scsi_execute_async() returned failure  
and the completion would never complete.
For instance, I would bet that a fair number of the other int- 
returning functions in include/scsi/scsi_device.h want __must_check  
on them.  That said, the person adding the __must_check should be  
REQUIRED to do at least a superficial audit of the code.
I'd propose a few simple rules:
   (1) If it can return the only pointer to freshly-allocated pointer  
then it's __must_check
   (2) If it can return a hard error which the caller must handle  
specially, then it's __must_check
   (3) If the only possible error is a kernel bug then make the damn  
thing return void and give it a big fat WARN() when it fails.
   (4) For any other case (or if you are unsure), don't flag it.
And of course the burden of proof is on the person trying to add the  
__must_check.
