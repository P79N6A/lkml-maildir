Ah okay. Up until now, I thought it would be okay to change the style of
the code if it was listed in the CodingStyle document and in any other
cause should be left untouched as it would be left to the maintainers
personal preference. That's why I explicitly asked about the "if ((buf =
kmalloc(...)==NULL) -> buf = kmalloc(...); if (!buf)" type of changes.
Ofcourse, I should have put cosmetic changes in a separate patch anyway.
With friendly regards,
