This patch looks OK in principle.
However, are you sure you're not using a sledgehammer to crack a nut?
If the only reason you're doing this is because of the shared tag map,
then probably that should be the area you protect with a per-tag-map
lock.   The net effect of what you've done will be to serialise all
accesses to your storage devices.  For a small number of devices, this
probably won't matter than much, but for large numbers of devices,
you're probably going to introduce artificial performance degredation in
the I/O scheduler.
