A change was made today to the kernel's IRQ handlers.  See
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1999147&forum_id=2314
for details.
The patch at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.5/2.5.68/2.5.68-irq-fixes.patch.gz
Is Linus's current bitkeeper tree, plus fixes for 350 files.  I got most of
it, but various scsi drivers and non-x86 architectures will still need work.
