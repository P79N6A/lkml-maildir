Subject: module load/unload race protection?

Does the kernel's module loader (kernel/module.c, not kmod)
protect adequately against concurrent load/load or load/unload
requests? The question applies to both 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.
I'm trying to track down a problem where a user using a
RedHat 2.2.17-14 SMP kernel managed to trigger a situation where
a driver module had been unloaded while still being in use
(as in "the kernel has pointers into it", not USE_COUNT != 0).
I'm reviewing the driver's internal INC/DEC_USE_COUNT usage,
but so far I've not found any obvious errors.
