udhcpcd, version 0.9.9-pre (Gentoo ebuild
net-misc/udhcp-0.9.9_pre20041216-r1, no crazy optimisations, stock init
script, IP release disabled)
2.6.13, 2.6.14-rc1 (up to the patch) both work fine.
2.6.14-rc2 and 2.6.14-rc3 do not. (they can't discover IP address)
The window is between that commit and rc2.
(about 180 changesets)
I only suspect that patch, it could be something else but I highly doubt
it. I'll check the current kernel with the patch backed out when I have
to restart.
