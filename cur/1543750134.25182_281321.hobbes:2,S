I could, but I'm not sure there is a point.
The CD drive functions perfectly as a CD-ROM drive, so I just don't
think the cable could be bad.  
I can burn, rip, and mount CDs just fine.
Playing CDs works fine under Windows, but not Linux 2.6.x.
So far, it seems to be a Linux problem.  More specifically, something
about how gnome-cd controls the CD drive since Totem seems to play CDs
just fine.
My next step is to get a full trace of gnome-cd to at see more clearly
where the problem occurs.  Otherwise I really don't know how to debug
something like this.
I thought someone else might have seen it, or want further details.

You couldn't play audio tracks from the CD you put in it? :-)
