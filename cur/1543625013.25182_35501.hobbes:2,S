If this was a guarantee, I would assume that the initial two entries

If the extra bytes (reclen - namelen) *were* extra bits of file system
information, there would be no safe way of ensuring that the allocation
of a new directory entry didn't 'accidentally' overwrite these bytes.
Exactly how big should you assume reclen *really* is, if reclen
sometimes means the length of the record, and other times means a next
pointer offset?
