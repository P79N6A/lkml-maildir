A disk does not have a geometry, so two disks, even when identical
cannot be said to have the same geometry.
A geometry is a phantom, invented, depending on many parameters,
and one of them is the interface used. So, the same disk may get
different geometries on hdb and hdc.
See the FAQ

Most existing partitioners allow you to specify your favourite
geometry.

No, it is entirely different. CHS is completely arbitrary and fake.
At least, as long as your disk is Linux only.
As soon as you use Windows on the same disk, you must be careful
to invent the same numbers that the BIOS will invent.
So, you think of some numbers - your birthday or so - and specify
the same numbers to fdisk while partitioning both disks.
Common numbers are S=63 and H=255. Don't specify C if you can avoid it.
