If they're freeable, we should easily be able to move them, and therefore 
compact a fragmented slab. That way we can preserve the LRU'ness of it.
Stage 1: free the oldest entries. Stage 2: compact the slab into whole
pages. Stage 3: free whole pages back to teh page allocator.

LRU algorithm may need general tweaking like this anyway ... strict LRU
is expensive to keep.
