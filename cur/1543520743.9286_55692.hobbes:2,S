I did a test copying large amounts of memory around in 64kb chunks..
Cached:
 3dnow    : 25 secs
 integer  : 3 minutes
Non-Cached:
 3dnow    : 75 secs
 integer  : (Still running on another box after ~15 minutes)

I think the above figures speak for themselves.
Remember, I'm not running this on the correct bus speed, so the
proper benchmark will probably be much higher.

That sounds great.
How will these be selected, by an extra menu in the config ?

Since my initial posting, I read that on the the Winchip 2A the prefetch
instruction is treated as a nop. Eliminating these from the routine gains
a few more benchmarks. Would that then make it the same as the MMX-copy ?

Is this already in 2.3.x ?
