looks good.

(I'd like to stress that this problem only affects packages _recompiled_
with new gcc, running on NX capable CPUs - legacy apps or CPUs are in no
way affected. Also, even with a recompile, apps/kernels/distros have a
number of other options as well even without this kernel fix, of varying
granularity: to use the setarch utility, to set the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC
personality bit within the code, or to pass in the noexec=off kernel
commandline option, or to add a oneliner patch to their heap of 1500+
kernel patches, or to fix the application. Also, with Arjan's patch
applied, the execstack utility can be used to remark the binary
permanently, if needed.)
