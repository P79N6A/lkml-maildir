The descriptions for CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G450 and CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G100A
in drivers/video/Kconfig (current 2.6) are confusing: Both want to be
selected for Matrox G100, G200, G400 based video cards.
In the menu, it's
# G100/G200/G400/G450/G550 support (sets FB_MATROX_G100, FB_MATROX_G450)
#	G100/G200/G400 support     (sets FB_MATROX_G100)
#	G400 second head support
where the second depends on the first _not_ being selected.
How about this instead?
# Gxxx (generic) (sets FB_MATROX_G100)
#	G400 second head (depends FB_MATROX_GXXX, FB_MATROX_I2C)
			 (sets FB_MATROX_G450)
#	G450/550 support (depends on FB_MATROX_GXXX)
