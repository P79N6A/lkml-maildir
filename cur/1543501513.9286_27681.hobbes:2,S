I was hoping someone's run into this problem and could help me with a
solution:
I've just installed a fresh Red Hat 6.0 distribution, and the first thing I
am trying to do is install the PPTP masquerading kernel patch (from
http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/chaffee/linux_pptp.html
).
I'm trying to install the patch pptp-ipmasq-pptp-2.2.5 patch into my Redhat
6.0 kernel (Version 2.2.5-15).
I've copied the patch to /usr/src and run patch -p0 <
patch-ipmasq-pptp-2.2.5
Upon running this, I get the following output:
Hunk #1 FAILED at 41
The rest of the patch completes correctly.
The Config.in.rej file in /usr/src/linux/net/ipv4 reads as follows:
***************
*** 41,46 ****
      bool 'IP: transparent proxy support' CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY
      bool 'IP: masquerading' CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE
      if [ "$CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE" != "n" ]; then
        comment 'Protocol-specific masquerading support will be built as
modules.'
        bool 'IP: ICMP masquerading' CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_ICMP
        comment 'Protocol-specific masquerading support will be built as
modules.'
--- 41,47 ----
      bool 'IP: transparent proxy support' CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY
      bool 'IP: masquerading' CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE
      if [ "$CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE" != "n" ]; then
+       tristate 'IP: pptp masq support' CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_PPTP
        comment 'Protocol-specific masquerading support will be built as
modules.'
        bool 'IP: ICMP masquerading' CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE_ICMP
        comment 'Protocol-specific masquerading support will be built as
modules.'
I've tried changing the $CONFIG_IP_MASQUERADE variable in Config.in to both
"n" and "y" and tried to apply the Config.in.rej patch but it still fails
with the same error. I've also attempted a 'patch -R < Config.in.rej' with
no luck.
Again, this is the first thing I am doing to this system after the initial
install and am pretty stumped.
I appreciate any help you can give me on this.
Thanks again,
Chad McEntire
