To quote from Bach's "The Design of the UNIX Operating System" published
in 1986, page 4:
	Viewing the system as a set of layers, the operating system is
	commonly called the system kernel, or just the kernel, emphasizing 
	its isolation from user programs.
This is the definition of operating system I was taught in the early 
seventies.
This would support the idea that the only GNU operating system is HURD.
Bach uses the term "UNIX system" to describe the complete system, including
the shell, libraries, utilities, compilers etc.
Which might lend some support to using GNU/Linux when describing the 
complete system (distribution?) But certainly not when describing the
Linux operating system.
