I don't see any issue on making both dependent on VIDEO_TUNER for
2.6.24, since they are currently used only by tuner core module
(tuner.ko).
Yet, the same kind of trouble can happen with other drivers that can be
shared by both V4L and DVB cores, like tda9887 and tda8290.
The proper solution for 2.6.25 seems to create a drivers/media/tuners
directory and write some different rules at Kconfig.
