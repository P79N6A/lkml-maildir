Hmm. I'm working for the guys who sell the $25000 - $50000 machines
that do this... ;-)

Right.

OK.

Count on seek times of 16ms. Things may be a bit better, but not by
much.
Your files are going to be hopelessly scattered anyway: when you're
recording 24 files at 96kHz and writing those files sequentially, they
will get interleaved all over the place....
You said hardware buffer. That doesn't mean you can't have a software
buffer. 
If a user hits "rewind", you tell all the buffer programs to do the
rewind. So after 16ms the first has the first part of the buffer
loaded. After another 16ms the second has its buffer loaded.
In the mean while, you should asynchronously be playing those tracks
that happen to be already in the buffer. Prevent transients, and the
human won't notice. Have a button that says: "final" which will mean
that you wait for completion. 
A human who hears: "Hey Where did the trumpet in the intro go?", will
hit rewind again, and this time it will be there, and the human will
blame himself....

This is NOT an option: the mixer will have to be able to offset the
different tracks. 
Suppose you find out that the trompetist was 30m away, so was playing
100ms too late. You will want to be able to mix him in with the rest
of the instruments at the right moment. So you should be able to run
different tracks at different offsets anyway. And having the tracks
separate is only useful if THAT's what you want to do with it... 
So separating the tracks is good.

The question is: How much seeking can you tolerate before you don't
meet the throughput requirements anymore. 
This can be calculated pretty easily:
In a second you need 24bit / (8bits/byte) * 96KHz * 24channels = 6.9Mb
of data. With a 20Mb per second disk, you need 0.35 seconds of
disk-time to read this. So you have 0.65 seconds of "seek-time" to do
the seeks. So you can allow about 40 seeks per second. This means that
per channel you need to issue a read of about 0.6 seconds or 172k to
achieve this performance. If you'd read about 250k at a time, you have
some margin left.
So if you want the "perfect" playback, you need 24*250k = 6Mb of data,
and 24 seeks. That takes 6/20 + 24*0.016 = 684ms. Clicking the rewind
button takes 300ms, so this is just a teeny bit slower.
I'm working on the video part of the machine. I'll be playing along
the video that goes along with the sound. Seems to be working. :-) It
is THEIR responsibility to configure the machine that my driver
achieves the 3MB per second of video throughput alongside with the
7 or 14Mb (for the 48 channel model) of audio throughput. 
Oh, one more tip: Have a commandline backend: don't do anything in the
user-interface program. 
I have an "mp3 box": a Linux machine with a large harddisk that plays
my music for me. I very much like "kjukebox", but quits as soon as I
kill the userinterface by turning off my workstation.
It should have been designed with a backend that schedules the songs,
and a userinterface that interacts with that. The userinterface can
then be used to tell it: "play this and that", and then the backend
plays it wether the frontend is present or not.
