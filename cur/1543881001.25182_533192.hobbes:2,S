It's very unclear what type this returns, in terms of both size and
signedness.  Perhaps it always returns a u64, dunno.  If it does, that will
cause the arithmetic which uses this macro to go 64-bit too.  Casting the
whole return value to u32 would fix all those doubts up.

n&0xffffffff would be simpler.
Do we actually have any call for this?
