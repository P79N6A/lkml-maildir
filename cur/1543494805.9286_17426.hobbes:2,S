Don't give up. I'll guess that 'ps' broke because the kernel wouldn't
let it seek. Since 'ps' shares code with 'top', it keeps a few files
open for performance.
Applications should see the /proc files as named FIFOs, but lseek()
must be supported. I'd rather have seekable FIFOs than zero-length
files full of data.
