Ah yes -- this behaviour of int3 do_trap was always a source of bugs. I remember
fixing such things in this area several times (last time in the RT kernel), but 
I keep forgetting it. Sorry.
The correct fix is to run the int3 and debug handlers on the process stack 
when the fault originated from user space. Then they can run preemptive
and it's ok to schedule for the lock too.
I'll fix that tomorrow.
