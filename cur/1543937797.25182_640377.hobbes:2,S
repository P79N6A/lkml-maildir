The VFS already handles ESTALE.
If a pathname resolution encounters an ESTALE at any point, the  
resolution is restarted exactly once, and an additional flag is  
passed to the file system during each lookup that forces each  
component in the path to be revalidated on the server.  This has no  
possibility of causing an infinite loop.
Is there some part of this logic that is no longer working?
