Strace shows that the history really is updated with no locking:
  4030  open("/home/phillips/.bash_history", O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC) = 4
  4030  write(4, "l\nless README\ne ../*test8/fs/ext"..., 7546) = 7546
  4030  close(4)                          =
0                                                                                                
There's no reason to continue doing the read after you've detected the
page was pulled out from under you - clearly it's a user error state,
the only question is: return the error and break the buggy application? 
Or gloss over it.  And it seems like returning the error might actually
break bash - maybe it deserves it... but...
