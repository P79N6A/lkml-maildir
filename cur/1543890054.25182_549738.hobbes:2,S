Good to hear - I also want my kernel to be configured correctly, of course,
but I'm also happy if 'make oldconfig' keeps my correctly configured kernel,
configured correctly.
So USB_DEVICE_CLASS='y' for a few more cycles is like music to my ears.

"Some distributions need this feature for libusb-based applications (like
 lsusb) to work, unless the udev rule above is configured"
The reason I stress lsusb so much is because for many operators, it is the
first thing they do in case of USB problems 'is my device even there?'.
So it would be what people notice breaking - even though the underlying
issue is with libusb.
Thanks!
