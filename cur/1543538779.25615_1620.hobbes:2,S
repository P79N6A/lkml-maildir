Well, just do:
inline void * operator new [] (size_t size, int flags)
{
	return kmalloc(size, flags);
}
However, note that the kernel doesn't support static constructors or
destructors, for example.  So yes, you can use a C++ compiler if you
insist (and rewrite the Makefiles accordingly), but it's going to be a
relatively crippled version.
The main reason that the kernel doesn't support C++ is that it is
painful enough to deal with multiple versions of gcc.  Throwing a mix
of C and C++ into it would make it an even worse nightmare.
