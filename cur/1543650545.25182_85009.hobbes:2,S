mksquashfs...

A r/w compressed filesystem may be my next project...  As a couple of
people have mentioned there are compressed r/w filesystems already
out there.
As you'll know, there are always tradeoffs with filesystem design,
it is very difficult to get as good compression with a r/w fs
than with a read only filesystem.  I wanted to get maximum
compression, and quite a few of the techniques I use rely on
its read-only nature.
An append only (i.e. files can be added, but not modified), fs might
be a useful compromise.  With compressed metadata, any modification
of files will inevitably achive different compression ratios, and so
modification of metadata/files in place is not an option.  Appending
modified metadata/data brings you to log-structured (journalling)
filesystems and compaction (log cleaning) requirements with consequent
loss of compression.
