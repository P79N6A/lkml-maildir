Frankly, I do not think that people should be that worried about PSU. If you
think about it, how much of information can be disclosed via this feature?
Most of us who work for a company or access the Net using some other 
facility like college LAN are constantly monitored. I word as a sysadmin
for a physics department at one big school and have access to the full log
of the Internet access. You should see what pages people are looking at
! :-) How much more can be disclosed? I doubt that more than usual. Who
cares if someone knows the serial number of your CPU as long as he
can't control it. I can give you mine right now if you want.
