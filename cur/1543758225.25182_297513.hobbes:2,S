But you may not know that you need it since in the help text I
intentionally didn't mention which software requires the option to be
set to Y (I didn't mention it, since I didn't want to use the kernel
configuration help text to get free advertisement, but OTOH if people is
unsure while they configure the kernel I certainly prefer that they set
it to Y ;).

IPV6 is some relevant amount of code and complexity, seccomp is only a
few bytes and very simple, it's not even a kbyte of ram that you're
paying if you enable it. Only embedded cares about bytes, and that's why
the option exists for embedded.
One thing I'm concerned about (more than the "Y" in the help text) is
that the distributions will enable the option in their binary kernel
images. I hope they will given it's only a matter of a few bytes.
Thanks.
