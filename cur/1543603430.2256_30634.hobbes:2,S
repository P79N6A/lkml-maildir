Well, there are indeed a few improvements to get with machine specific
optimisations on unaccelerated framebuffer.
One example is, on PPC, the use of a floating point register to do the
blits 64 bits at a time. This allow the PCI host controller to generate
bursts of 2 32 bits transactions (for machines with controllers unable
to write combine). Of course, having such optimisations in the kernel
is tricky because of the lazy FPU switching (well, at least on PPC),
but the point is that improvement _is_ possible.
Regards,
Ben.
