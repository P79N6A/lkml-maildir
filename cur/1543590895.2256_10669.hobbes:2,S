I do not see where it is simpler. The only difference is that
name is unknown. 8)

Paaardon! It is the only place where it takes sense to tell: "simpler"
and it was sense of your patch! Of course, it is much "simpler" to leave
all the devices in buggy state, no doubts. 8)
What's about dev_probe_lock, I again do not understand why it is not deleted.
Please, shed some light.
