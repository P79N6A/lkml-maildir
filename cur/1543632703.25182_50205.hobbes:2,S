Hi.
I have a question regarding something I came across a while ago. A
filesystem (reiserfs) had been set up on a disk without making any
partitions. The entry in /etc/fstab looked something like this:
/dev/hdc	/mount/point	reiserfs	defaults	0 0
When I saw this, I instinctively partitioned the drive so that /dev/hdc1
was mounted instead. But was this really necessary? If I want to put only
one filesystem on a disk, do I need to partition at all? It seemed to work
fine before I changed it. I had just never heard of this before, and
automatically assumed that the problems the box was having could be
related to this.
