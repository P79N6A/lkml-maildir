This is news to me. DOS always showed messages, and under Win95,
it was either F8 or removing logo.sys. I did troubleshoot it ;-)

I have to agree so really. Just because there's a color option for 
everything does not mean one should use it.
In fact, I moved away[2] from the default Midnight Commander styling 
because it's just - as Dave calls it - salad colors[1].
Some is good, as long as it is not excessive. While I could imagine that 
Knoppix will abuse the feature and use vt.printk_color=9,9,9,9,11,10,12, 
this is not what serious people would do.
