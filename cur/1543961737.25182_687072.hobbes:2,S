I mean already present clock... but it looks only I have problem with this using Linux. 
I've checked other OS with the same board and it switch off the SD clock after complete the data transfer and switching the SD to idle mode.

OK OK. I understand. :)
I check some devices with the SD and Linux inside and all of them had modified driver which is able to switch off the clock :)
Thus the "persistent clock" problem exist, but nobody say about it :)
Thank you for all explanations.
