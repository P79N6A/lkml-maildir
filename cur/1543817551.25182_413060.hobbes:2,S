Changes:
Added:
 +sched-staircase14.2_15.patch
A major improvement in the staircase code fixes low I/O under heavy cpu load, 
makes it starvation resistant, improves behaviour under heavy "system" loads, 
fixes a slowdown under "compute" mode and has numerous other 
microoptimisations.
Modified:
 -swsusp-post_resume_aggressive_swap_prefetch.patch
 +swsusp-post_resume_aggressive_swap_prefetch-1.patch
A minor change in the code to perform aggressive swap prefetching on swsusp 
resume slightly later should speed up resume time.
 -2.6.16-ck2-version.patch
 +2.6.16-ck3-version.patch
