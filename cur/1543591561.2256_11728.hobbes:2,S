Because, for example, a kernel compile can be a part of the standard 
install now, and you will end up with a kernel built specifically for 
your machine that doesn't print 50 initialization failed messages on boot.
Libranet (Debian offshoot) does that already.  It is the only distro 
that I know of that does this.  This also makes it about a thousand 
times easier for distributions.  They don't have to write huge (have you 
ever looked at Redhat scripts??) init scripts to cover every single 
possibility and load any module you might need.  It's built into the 
kernel, the way it should be!
And you can also now run a kernel built for your shiny new Athlon, not 
the old piece of shit that was hot stuff in '92.
