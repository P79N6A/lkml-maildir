Thanks Glauber.  Well put.
That said, future revs of vSMP will have the ability to work optimally even
without the paravirtualized irq ops.  This is an upcoming feature, and did not
exist when we tested the paravirt ops 2-3 months ago.  So, it will be
better, now, not to select PARAVIRT while selecting X86_VSMP.  Then,
CONFIG_VSMP will just select the cacheline padding to be used and PARAVIRT
will be needed if irq operations need to be paravirtualized.
I shall submit a patch to that effect.
Thanks,
Kiran
