If it can be done today on a vmlinux then it can be done the same way
with the mechanism I have proposed.  Period, full stop.

In thory one could create an extended bzImage format which could handle
a concatenated, and easily replaceable, initrd, but if it's done on
vmlinux today it would make a *lot* more sense to have it be done on the
vmlinux and nothing else.
