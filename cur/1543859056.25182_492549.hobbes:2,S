How about we stick something like this on top of that patch. It should
preserve the dirty state as required.
I tried to tinker with avoiding the clear/set thing but could not
convince myself it was close to safe.
This should be safe; page_mkclean walks the rmap and flips the pte's
under the pte lock and records the dirty state while iterating.
Concurrent faults will either do set_page_dirty() before we get around
to doing it or vice versa, but dirty state is not lost.
