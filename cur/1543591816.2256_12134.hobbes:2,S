I never seen those running on 64bit boxes even if they are supposed to
run there too.
Here it's a little different, 32bit virtual address space limitation
isn't always a showstopper for those kind of CPU intensive apps (they
don't need huge caches).

for the 32bit virtual address space issues of course yes ;)

they're not the only ones doing that, I seen others doing that kind of
stuff, it's just a matter of information memory fast across a cluster,
if you delegate that work to a separate engine (btw they runs a
sparc32bit cpu, also guess why they aren't pci64) you can spend much
more cpu cycles of the main CPU on the userspace computations.
