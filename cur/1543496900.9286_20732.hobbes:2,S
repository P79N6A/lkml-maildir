I read that one of the reasons Niklaus Wirth didn't put a return(value)
statement in Pascal was that he considered it no better than a goto, and he
already had goto (much to his disgust).  So you had to set the function's
name to a value and jump (or find some other way) to the end of the
function.  This did at least have the merit that all exits from the routine
went via the same point.  (In Modula he got rid of the goto, but I don't
recall if there was a return(value).  I'd given up on languages which
attempted to save the world by then.)

Since we are about to hit the end of a routine, with associated stack
unwinding, program counter changes, etc, the number of nanoseconds saved is
unlikely to be noticed, particularly if KDE is starting.
