It's very easily modularizable, so noone will suffer bloat, except when
downloading an unnoticably bigger kernel tarball, and if Dave uses it for
the Linux Router Project, as he has implied, then hundreds (thousands?)
of people are going to benefit. If it is handy for what Dave is doing,
then there are good reasons to plonk such a module into the standard
sources, if only to easy recompilation for LRP users.
BUT - it's not handy for what Dave is doing, so the point is moot.
OK, I should rephrase that:
Dave has yet to convince anyone about, or sufficiently explain or
demonstrate the advantage he feels is there.
