It's not _me, it's those STP robots. :)

Also looking pretty okay on ext3, and sucking somewhat less
on the other filesystems.
 I run filesystem compares on two-ways, so the
delta is not as big.
2-CPU- 
linux-2.6.3		6055.26		0.0	ext3
2.6.4-rc1-mm2		6149.28		1.64    ext3
2.6.4-rc1		6004.18        -0.84    ext3
2.6.4-rc1-mm2		6061.28		0.1	jfs
2.6.4-rc2	        5977.53	       -1.36    jfs
2.6.4-rc1-mm2		6007.67	       -0.83    reiserfs

Gee, i told the STP robots to run the tests, and went out and had fun :)
We should talk, the robots would be your slaves, if you would but ask them.

The db load mixes the IO with some compute stuff, it will always run faster
than the fserver load.
