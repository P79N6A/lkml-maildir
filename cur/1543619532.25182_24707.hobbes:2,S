I experienced the 10 Mbit half duplex problems too with this card, but
they seemed to have gone away after a bugfix from Alan Cox somewhere in
2.4. Somewhere later I upgraded to 100 Mbit full duplex and never
experienced problems again until 2.4.17.
I think im gonna try some older kernels and look through diffs if I have
time.
