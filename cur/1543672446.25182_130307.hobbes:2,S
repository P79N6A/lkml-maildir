The ext2 filesystem in question uses 2kb block size. The drive can also 
handle disks with 1kb and 512b block sizes, but I don't have of those
disks (MOs are hard sectored, so you can't format one to use a different
hw block size).
Under 2.4 with ide-scsi/sd, ext2 with 2kb block size works, other block
sizes for the filesystem don't work (at least that was the case about a
year ago when I tried other sizes the last time).

Turned out to be quite easy once I found out that ide_cdrom_attach was
checking for drive->media == ide_cdrom. I had only looked as far as
ide_cdrom_setup before. :)
Too bad writing doesn't work out quite yet. At least the directory entry
got written, so part of it seems to work.

Yes, the error messages are gone. I skipped all the capability tests that 
go to the drive. Maybe that skips to much. Where does the hw block size 
get detected? I hope I didn't skip that part...
