Not sure what the problem is but it seem kernel related. If it's not - 
please forgive me.
I'm running and AMD Athlon 64 X2 on an Asus board with NVidia chipset. 
The software clock gains several seconds every minute. I'm running the 
2.6.13 kernel. NTPD doesn't help. It sets the time when it starts but I 
suspect the drift is too great for it to lock on. How can setting the 
clock be so hard?
Using these settings:
CONFIG_X86_64=y
CONFIG_64BIT=y
CONFIG_X86=y
CONFIG_MMU=y
CONFIG_RWSEM_GENERIC_SPINLOCK=y
CONFIG_GENERIC_CALIBRATE_DELAY=y
CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG=y
CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK=y
CONFIG_GENERIC_ISA_DMA=y
CONFIG_GENERIC_IOMAP=y
Falling asleep .... ZZZzzzzzZZZZzzzzzz
Help!
