Regardless of CONFIG_ACPI, FLAG_E820_RECLAIM gets defined

I can't see the ifndef path getting taken... am I missing something?

Seems like the "#ifdef" succeeds regardless of CONFIG_ACPI
perhaps change the CONFIG_ACPI = true case to #undef FLAG_E820_RECLAIM?
AFAICT you'd only have to make the additional change of wrapping that
third line of p_flags in an ifdef... prob a more elegant method?
The other issue would seem to be that ifndef CONFIG_ACPI you get
"define FLAG_E820_RECLAIM  CONFIG_E820_RECLAIM" which means it will
be either "y" or "n" (right?) and those would *both* seem to pass
the check against zero in (FLAG_E820_RECLAIM ? CHK_PMEM_RECLAIM : 0)
I just rolled out of bed, so if I'm being blatantly stupid just smack
me upside the head and move on :)
