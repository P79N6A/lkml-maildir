I guess it won't hurt - are you actually able to test this code?
afaict most of the data in there is locked with lock_kernel(), if it's
locked at all.
If you had some runtime problem and this patch fixed it then fine.  If
however you're not able to test this code then perhaps the safest option is
to simply remove that locking altogether, which is pretty much a
runtime-equivalent change.
