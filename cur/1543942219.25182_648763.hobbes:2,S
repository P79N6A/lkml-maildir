Exactly, so the first patch in this series (a while ago now) was a
common usage model abstraction of enclosures, and the second was an
implementation in terms of SES.   I will do one in terms of SGPIO as
well ... assuming I ever find a SGPIO enclosure ...

You can do it in user space as well.  It's just a bit difficult to get
information out of a SES enclosure without using it, and getting some of
the information is a requirement of the abstraction.
