I'm sorry to interrupt, but could you continue this discussion
elsewhere? We've begun to bottom-post in this topic, and let's
continue it this way. Fair enough?

So what should I actually post? 'cat /etc/mtab'? If so, here it is:
# cat /etc/mtab
/dev/hda3 / ext3 rw,errors=remount-ro 0 0
proc /proc proc rw 0 0
/sys /sys sysfs rw 0 0
varrun /var/run tmpfs rw 0 0
varlock /var/lock tmpfs rw 0 0
udev /dev tmpfs rw 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts rw,gid=5,mode=620 0 0
devshm /dev/shm tmpfs rw 0 0
/dev/hda1 /boot ext3 rw 0 0
/dev/hda5 /usr ext3 rw 0 0
Best regards,
Jano
