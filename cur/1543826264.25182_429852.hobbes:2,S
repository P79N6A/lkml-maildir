I still see (around 2.6.17-rc3) timer() existing in the same place and with 
the same definition - even if it now seems unused:
void timer(void)
{
        gettimeofday(&xtime, NULL);
        timeradd(&xtime, &local_offset, &xtime);
}

Yep, however I didn't reproduce any misbehaviour at that time.

Yes, I deleted sys_time64 time ago, forgot to update 
arch/um/sys-x86_64/syscall_table.c.

And that's why I didn't send the patches then in first place - I wanted to 
complete them (I have too many incomplete patches, and too little time to 
finish them :-( ).
