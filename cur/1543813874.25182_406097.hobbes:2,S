As a follow-up to close out this thread.  I only had a chance to test 
the nv driver for a short time before needing to go back to the xinerama 
capabilities of the Nvidia driver again.  I subsequently had a severe 
crash that beat up the filesystem pretty badly so I did a data backup 
and a clean install of Gentoo/KDE3.5 (kernel 2.6.15-r1) along with the 
binary Nvidia driver (1.0.8178-r3) and have not had the problem re-occur 
since.  The new install is using the same hardware and kernel config 
which has been stable for over a week of uptime now.  This would lead me 
to believe my previous install suffered from some evil filesystem 
gremlin that had snuck in from an earlier crash and continued to pop up 
to cause havok versus a genuine kernel bug.
I appreciate the help and feedback in trying to get this figured out.
Thanks,
Ken
