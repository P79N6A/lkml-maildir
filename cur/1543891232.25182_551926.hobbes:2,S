Hi Dawid
I tried to enable SPI flash device in our development platform (Mainstone).
Since the platform driver uses NOR flash device - it includes 
"include/asm-arm/mach/flash.h" file where the structure "flhash_platform 
_data" is defined.
The structure with the same name "flhash_platform _data" is also defined 
in "include/linux/spi/flash.h".
These structures are different - so they cause compile errors.
I attached the fix for this issue. IMHO it's more preferable to resolve 
issue by minor modification of SPI driver than touching all arm platform 
drivers.

Could you please take a look at this. The fix is simple. If you don't complain could you please include it. 
Thanks,

P/S Also I have a question:
I faced rather strange problem with sending read and write commands  to 
SPI  flash. It works Ok if I reverse 32bit SPI FLASH command
I mean - read/write/erase works if to substitute
    flash->command[0] = OPCODE_SE;
    flash->command[1] = offset >> 16;
    flash->command[2] = offset >> 8;
    flash->command[3] = offset;
for
    flash->command[3] = OPCODE_SE;
    flash->command[2] = offset >> 16;
    flash->command[1] = offset >> 8;
    flash->command[0] = offset;
in file drivers/mtd/devices/m25p80.c
It seems pretty strange and may require more investigation.
I wonder If you have any ideas why it could happen? If anybody tested 
m25p80.c driver on LittleEndian platforms?
