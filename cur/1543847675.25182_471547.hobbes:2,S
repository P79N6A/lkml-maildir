Hi dean,
Yes, good idea. I effectively did the 1 byte write to make sure it could be
coherent for any code alignment on the machine. The only problem with modifying
the jne into a je is this : How can we take a pointer to this assembly
instruction when it is generated by gcc ? We can always search for an
instruction pattern after the inline assembly, but we have no guarantee that
gcc will not put any code between the inline asm and the actual jne.
