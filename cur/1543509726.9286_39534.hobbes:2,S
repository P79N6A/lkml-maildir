Yep, I was really posting to the "Linux doesn't have it and will have
ages to wait" post before, not the "please can I have 64 bit files"
posts before that.
I'll have a loot at how much work the glibc stubs will be --- even if
it's just for testing.  Having the whole environment tested and
validated will make it a lot easier to present to Linus.
