The i_size limit is also wrong for dense files; I'd be satisfied with
just getting it right!  i_blocks handling through the quota calls is
cleaner these days, but I don't think that's a particularly satisfactory
solution --- reaching maximum file size has all sorts of specific
semantics such as sending SIGXFSZ which you don't really want to have to
replicate.

Yep.

True, but it's not really a problem right now --- i_blocks is counted in
fs blocksize units, so we're nowhere near overflowing that.  It's only
when stat() converts it to st_blocks' 512-byte units that we get into
trouble within the kernel.

Agreed.
