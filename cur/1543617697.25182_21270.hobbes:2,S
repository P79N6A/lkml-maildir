[SNIPPED....]
More sickness follows...
The following script. Used to insert modules, many wouldn't install of
course... In fact, if I would run it several times, I could get the
modules that had to be loaded in a specific order to be installed, then
use `modprobe -c` to make a current listing for /etc/modules.conf.
VER=`uname -r`
for x in `find /lib/modules/${VER} -name "*.o"` ; do
echo $x
insmod $x
done
But with Linux-2.4.7, the system Crashes to a hard-stop on:
MIDI Loopback device driver.
XM 3812 and ODL3
Another OOps at
cs98x0.c
That's about all I could see. There were no logs upon boot, in fact,
some SCSI disk driver installed itself instead of my BusLogic so
no disk I/O was possible!!!

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.7 on an i686 machine (797.90 BogoMips).
    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
