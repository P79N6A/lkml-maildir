That would definetly cost way to much money and time to be in any way

I replaced all cables with "High Quality"-cables.
But as a "Joe user" it is practically impossible to really know if the
cables are good.
All i can say is that the "original" cables that came with the
enclosures appear a bit thin and the ones i bought appear much more
thick, have gold plated contacts and have a massive plaited shielding
IOW appear much more trustworthy. But, as i said, in the end i can't
really know if they are better than the original ones.
