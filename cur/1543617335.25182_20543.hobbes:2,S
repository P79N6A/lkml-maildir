In the same directory, yes.

3.6. is advantageous because of many other things, like LFS, etc.

There were problems with -o conv and remount (for root file system), but
they were cured in latest Marcelo's kernels.

After file system is mounted with -o conv, all new files will be created
in a new format. This file system will then no longer be mountable as
3.5 (and thus, inaccessible from 2.2 kernels).
New files will store generation counters. The possibility of a stale
handle lurking undetected is when old-format file was deleted, its
objectid was reused for new format file, and super-block generation
counter at that time happens to coincide with objectid of parent
directory of the old file. Not exactly likely thing to happen, but
still.
