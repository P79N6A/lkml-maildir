Distributing a copy of GPL is not a requirement for me as a licensor
however I did chose to include a copy of a specific version of a
specific license and did not make any other statements that is the
license for the work.

If they did not make any changes then they have to include the earliest
version of GPL that applies. If they did modifications and chose GPLv4
they will have to include GPL v4 (if such requirement is in GPLv4) because
what good any other license will do me?

Yes, this is my opinion.

License does not say otherwise. License says that if there is an
_additional_ stipulation my the licensor then some other license
(non existing yet license) may be used. They had to use this wording
because these licensed do not exist yet. If GPL would say:
"If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "or BSD license", you have the option of following
the terms and conditions either of that version or of BSD license"
would you still say that BSD is allowed by default by GPL? "GPL v2
and later versions" is not different from "GPL v2 or BSD" or
"GPLv2 or CDDL".
