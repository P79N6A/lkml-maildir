Hi,
In preparation of 2.4.20-pre, here's an updated version of the
block-highme patch. This enables block drivers to do I/O to high memory
pages instead of reverting to low memory bounce buffers.
Changes:
- (scsi) Fix critical SCpnt->request_buffer -> SCpnt->request.buffer
  error
- (scsi) Backport __init_io() changes from 2.5, that enable us to
  politely back off on queueing more I/O with any failure. We use this
  now instead of reverting to single segment requests on sgtable
  allocation failures. For a highmem host this got nasty, because we had
  to map the buffer_head and use a bounce buffer for that single segment
  anyway. That is now eliminated. Even for non-highmem I/O the single
  segment fall back is slower because of the over head associated with
  command setup etc.
