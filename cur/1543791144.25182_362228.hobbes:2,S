That's not a fair comparison.
If you do not tell gcc to optimize for size you can't expect it to 
produce small code.
The following is with allnoconfig + CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y + intelligent 
setting of the options shown by "make oldconfig" after setting 
CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y (the third kernel is built without 
-fno-unit-at-a-time):
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 522545   77694   31256  631495   9a2c7 vmlinux-2.95
 436878   76594   32248  545720   853b8 vmlinux-4.0
 429420   76370   32184  537974   83576 vmlinux-4.0-unit-at-a-time

There's a new reason for removing gcc-2.95.x support.  ;-)
