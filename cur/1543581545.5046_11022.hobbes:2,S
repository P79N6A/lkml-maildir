Doug,
Thank you for enlightening me on the subtle
interaction of module loading and devfs.
One thing that confused me was that "generic" was
present On my system, I use the module version of
scsi generic driver.
Am I right then assuming  that SCSI subsystem
somehow supports the loading of "sg" driver module
automagically (as opposed to mod_sr.o )?
Otherwise I can't explain why "generic" was already
present when I ran "ls", but "cd" wasn't.
(During the boot I see the string "sg" just prior to the
loading of tmscsim (DC390) driver module. The NCR driver
is built-in and recognized earlier. Aha, could it be that
"sg" is used for the initial probing of
device types and such?)
Maybe I am missing something here regarding module
loading very much.
Also, my setting may be quite Debian GNU/Linux
specific.
Anyway, I looked again very carefully at the devfs README file
under
    /usr/src/linux/Documenation/filesystems/devfs
and found it a litte out of date.
 -   Richard Booch has a document
     dated Oct 16, 2000 at the URL site mentioned in the
     README file.
     The one under /usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/devfs
     is dated 3-JUL-2000.
     So at least, we might want to upgrade the document
     to the latest available from the original author.
 -   Yet, even the one at the URL site doesn't
     reflect the name changes that took place last year.
     SCSI device names and others are not quite up to date and
     don't agree with what we see on the real system.
     (I am assuming that this is generally true and
      not Debian-specific.)
Attached is my first cut to update the of the document.
I would appreciate it if the README document is updated
to reflect the current implemntation.
I would be glad to help by typing the first rough draft
initially according to the suggestions.
Happy Hacking,
Chiaki Ishikawa

  SCSI Generic Devices
