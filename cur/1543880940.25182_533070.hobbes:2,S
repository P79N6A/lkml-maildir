I've been running this one for several hours now, with amanda running in the 
background due a typu in one of my scripts, so now its playing catchup.
This one is another keeper IMO, or as we are fond of saying around here, its 
good enough for the girls I go with.  If this isn't the best one so far, its 
very very close and I'm getting pickier.  kmail is the only thing that's 
lagging, and that's just kmail, which I believe is single threaded.  Even 
with gzip eating 95% of the cpu, graphics animations like the cards in 
patience are moving at at least 80% speed.  Nice, keep this one and use it 
for the reference.
