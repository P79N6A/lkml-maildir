Hi Steve.

Which ID's with the following?
 Q> ProFTPD 1.2.0pre1 Server (ProFTPD) [if-c]
 Q> Anonymous access granted, restrictions apply.
 Q> /pub/linux/kernel: No such file or directory
It's neither ftp.demon.co.uk nor unix.hensa.ac.uk but is the one that
running `ncftp ftp.uk.kernel.org` most often gives me...
OK, I've tracked it down. That one is compton-if-c.mirror.ac.uk and
appears to be a dud mirror...
