Sure, but it doesn't solve this case, AFAICT:
void func(void)
{
	static DEFINE_PER_CPU(x, int);
	__get_per_cpu(x)++;
}
The compiler will create a variable called "per_cpu__x.0" and your asm
reference to "per_cpu__x" will cause a link failure, no?  Obviously, you
would have noticed this, so I'm wondering what I'm missing.
I hit this in mm/page-writeback.c:balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited().
Confused,
Rusty.
