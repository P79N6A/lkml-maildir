My assumption would be that once 2.6.9 is released, it's not uber-stable
immediately ... so it'd be nice to keep at least one minor rev back
going on the bugfix stream (eg 2.6.8.X) .... for people who want an 
uber-stable kernel. Doing more than 1 back would indeed seem 
counter-productive.
That said it's unlikely there would still be urgent fixes for 2.6.8 a few
weeks after it was released, but it seems like the right thing to do, at
least in principle (maybe for a security fix, or something).
