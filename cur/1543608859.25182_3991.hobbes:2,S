If you are doing SSL termination without a hardware crypto accelerator
then the cost of the public key operations for the SSL handshake will
far outweigh the cost of TCP termination and the webserver.  With a
typical machine (say a 1 GHz P3) I would estimate you could do 200 SSL
handshakes/sec with apache/modssl (with 95% of your CPU time spent in
OpenSSL RSA code).  With a hardware crypto accelerator you could get
up to 600-1000 handshakes/sec but the crypto will still be the
bottleneck.
