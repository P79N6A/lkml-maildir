Assuming you are talking about a process-global signal (not pthread_kill),
then POSIX does not permit this race condition.  If there is any thread
that can take the signal (i.e. not blocking it, or is sigwait'ing for it),
then one such thread must take the signal.  The selection of the thread and
it beginning its action (i.e. choosing a signal handler, and saving the
signal mask the signal handler will restore on its return; or process death)
must be atomic with respect to that thread blocking the signal.
