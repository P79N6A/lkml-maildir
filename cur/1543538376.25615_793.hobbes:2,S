Why can it not work like this:  App fills memory.  Same app tries
to allocate more memory, OOM occurs, app that tried to allocate
more memory is killed?
Granted, it is possible for app to use all memory and as OOM
occurs a DIFFERENT app tries to allocate memory, but on a desktop
box, I believe that that would likely be rarer since it is rarer
for OOM on a desktop box in the first place.  When OOM, should
not the overcommit STOP?  In other words, we normally overcommit,
but when virtual memory is exhausted completely, any malloc()'s
will return NULL to the app?  *THAT* would be acceptible to me,
if it is possible and no other gotchas result.  I could
understand it then.

Exactly, and it is not easy to determine - if at all possible.

Well, I do like this suggestion, and might try that out
indeed.  Unfortunately, OOM is VERY RARE for me.  So, one might
say I needn't worry because it is such a rarity.  Perhaps so, but
it irks me that something can actually go _bad_ in Linux and
there is no apparent good all winning solution.
How about an algorithm that autocreates more swap space from
certain preconfigured places while emailing you or wailing sirens
that you're in trouble.  Heck, give a daemon your credit card
number and have it order more RAM online when resources get
low.  I guess we'd need a speedy way of delivering it then
though, and an automated way of installing it in a hot swapable
manner...  ;o)
Any takers?
Take care, and thanks for the suggestion.
