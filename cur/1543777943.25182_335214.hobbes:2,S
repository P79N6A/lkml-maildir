The 2.6.13-rc3 version of KDB (Linux Kernel Debugger) supports a USB
keyboard (CONFIG_KDB_USB).  At the moment it only supports the OHCI
interface, this is what SGI hardware uses.  If anybody has hardware
that uses the UHCI interface for the keyboard and can create a kdb
patch, that patch will be gratefully accepted.
