Subject: bttv.c and miroPCTV detection broken since 2.2.0-final

The auto-detection of miro PCTV in bttv.c doesn't work any more. The
probing routine finds Aimslab-VHX instead. The problem is in the
"idcard" function - it probes VHX before miro and gets positive response
(don't ask me why). The detection of miro is a bit strange anyway - miro
PRO is okay, but miro (normal) is just in an else-branch without
condition - it means if "BTTV_UNKNOWN" is specified, and no other card
is detected (Haup. or STB) then Miro is assumed.
As a consequence of the failed detection the driver won't auto-detect
the tuner, which results in a blue-screen in xawtv.
Any idea how to auto-detect the (normal) miro ?
A hotfix for miro-users is to remove the two lines with
Aimslab-detection [... there are some kernel or module options I can't
remember anymore ... I prefer the hard method ;-) ]
