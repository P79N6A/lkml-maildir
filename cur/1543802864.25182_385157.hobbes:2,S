Same problem here with 2.6.15-mm3:
   $ lspci -s 00:02.0 -v
   00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML Express Graphics Controller (rev 03) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
   	Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company nx6110/nc6120
   	Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 16
   	Memory at d0400000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=512K]
   	I/O ports at 7000 [size=8]
   	Memory at c0000000 (32-bit, prefetchable) [size=256M]
   	Memory at d0480000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256K]
   	Capabilities: [d0] Power Management version 2
   $ modprobe -v agpgart
   insmod /lib/modules/2.6.15-mm3/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.ko 
   FATAL: Error inserting agpgart (/lib/modules/2.6.15-mm3/kernel/drivers/char/agp/agpgart.ko): No such device
And as a consequence intel-agp, drm, and i915 cannot be loaded.
The problem disappears if I revert git-agpgart.patch.
