yes, you are probably right. I thought about that, but in no way
I could imagine such a drastic situation. I was wondering if maybe
the kernel did different things for AMD and Pentium, but both
are treated the same, as a i386, RIGHT?????
I have just tried on another AMD core, a 1Ghz Duron, and it outperforms
the AMD K6 (as expected) and the 2.6Ghz P4 as well, probably due to the
same thing.
