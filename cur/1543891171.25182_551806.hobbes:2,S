Ok. So how about the attached patch? It's a bit different than discussed,
but I think it's much cleaner because it preserves the current behavior of
the callback and keeps that bit of page locking inside core code. Not tested
as of yet, but I can run it tommorrow.

[PATCH] Release page lock before calling ->page_mkwrite
__do_fault() was calling ->page_mkwrite() with the page lock held, which
violates the locking rules for that callback. Release and retake the page
lock around the callback to avoid deadlocking file systems which manually
take it.
