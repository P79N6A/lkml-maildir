I thought we did have such a rule.  Well, it's unwritten I guess...
I'll go knock up a Documentation/user_to_kernel_datatypes.txt file to
set this in stone.
Oh, and shouldn't we be using the "__*" style types for crossing the
user/kernel boundry (__u8, __u16, __u32, etc.)?  I thought that is what
those versions were for.
