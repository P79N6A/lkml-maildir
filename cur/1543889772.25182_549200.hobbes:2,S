Doing SETXFER by polling only handles the cases where the driver 
actually honors ATA_TFLAG_POLLING, which is /not/ always the case.
If the new policy ensures that it continues to be OK to /not/ honor 
ATA_TFLAG_POLLING -- thus limiting SETXFER polling assumptions to older 
hardware -- that's fine, and it merely needs to be documented.
But let us not make the assumption that this bandaid fixes all cases, 
because the bandaid is not applied in all cases.
