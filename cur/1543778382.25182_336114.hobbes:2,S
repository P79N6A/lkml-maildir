The current Linus tree includes generic ACPI support
for deep C-states on SMP machines. (deep means higher than C1)
I don't have any problem with people having platform specific
modules to handle platform specific features.  However, if
the system really intends to support SMP ACPI C-states deeper
than C1 and the generic ACPI code doesn't support it,
then it is either a Linux/ACPI bug or a BIOS bug -- file away:-)
I.e. The whole concept of ACPI is that you shoulud _not_ need
a platform specific driver to accomplish this.
cheers,
