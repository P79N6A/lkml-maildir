It looks like what your fix does is to force a 512-byte blocksize on the 
floppy.
Which implies to me that the floppy driver is broken for other blocksizes.
Does your patch still leave the floppy driver broken for something like a 
mounted minix or ext2 filesystem? Those have 1kB blocksizes, and will set 
it to that. If the non-512B blocksize in the floppy driver is broken, then 
such mounted filesystems should not work reliably either.
