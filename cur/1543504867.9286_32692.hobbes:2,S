When you export / and /raid, the underlying physical file systems are
already mounted.

Try explicitly exporting the cdrom ONLY after it is actually mounted on
the server.  This is probably a confusing point since, as you note, the
older nfs server let you get away with mounting it after the export took
place.
Try this little script to accomplish things in the correct order (edit
accordingly).  
---------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
case $1 in
      exp* ) flag=-a
	    ;;
       un* ) flag=-u
	    ;;
         * ) echo "Usage: nfscd exp<ort>|un<export>"
	     exit 1
	    ;;
esac
if [ $flag = "-a" ]; then
    mount -t isofs /dev/cdrom /misc/cd
fi
exportfs -v $flag \*.your.net:/misc/cd
if [ $flag = "-u" ]; then
    umount /misc/cd
fi
----------------------------------------------------
Note that this is quite simplistic, and does zero error checking!
Good luck,
Steve
