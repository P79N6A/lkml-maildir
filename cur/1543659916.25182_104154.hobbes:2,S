The first one isn't in the tree as yet ... I just haven't been excited
enough about speeding up boot speed, to be perfectly honest, seeing as 
it still takes 5 minutes anyway. It might make more sense once kexec
works, and the percentage improvement would become significant.
The local_pgdat stuff definitely makes sense ... I'd kind of prefer it 
to go after the mem_map so I don't have to think about alignment
issues so much, but it's been stable for ages, so I guess I'll push it
as soon as Linus returns from vacation ...
