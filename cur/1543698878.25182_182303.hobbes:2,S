Hi,
the recent inclusion of <asm/system.h> into spinlock.h causes a cyclic 
inclusion under the sparc architecture. This breaks the build (at the 
beginning of make dep) in oplib.h because spinlock_t is not yet defined.
linux/spinlock.h
   asm/system.h
     asm/oplib.h
       linux/spinlock.h
     ERROR! (asm/oplib.h)
I was working with 2.4.23-bk3 and -bk4.
The change was introduced in the following changeset:
--------------------
ChangeSet 1.1192.4.2 2003/12/02 11:25:25 ralf@linux-mips.org
   [PATCH] Include <asm/system.h> into spinlock.h
   <linux/spinlock.h> uses local_irq_save() etc. from <asm/spinlock.h> but
   relies on this header file having been dragged in on some other way.
   So if things are just right the build may blow up ...
include/linux/spinlock.h 1.9 2003/11/28 10:38:30 ralf@linux-mips.org
   Include <asm/system.h> into spinlock.h
--------------------
Not including asm/oplib.h from asm/system.h seems to fix this.
The patch drops this include.
