E2fsprogs with the full revision history imported into git is 100
megs, and that's with deltas.  E2fsprogs imported into Mercurial is 17
megs (and actually, the imported repository was just a tad bit smaller
than e2fsprogs' BK repository).
Which do you think is going to be faster to operate from a cold start
using 4200 rpm laptop drives?  :-)
