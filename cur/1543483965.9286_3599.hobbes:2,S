It doesn't. You can only set and read the hostname.
The "domainname" is something that is only used for the NIS domain, the
DNS domainname is something completely different. However on much
systems where NIS is used they are the same ASCII string for convenience.
On Linux systems, the hostname is usually only set to the hostname.
Eg, just "defiant" instead of "defiant.cistron.nl". The domainname can
then be found by looking up "defiant" through /etc/hosts or DNS.
BSD based systems often set the system hostname to the FQDN, eg
the complete "defiant.cistron.nl" instead of just "defiant". IMHO,
that makes more sense, but both methods seem to work.
Mike.
