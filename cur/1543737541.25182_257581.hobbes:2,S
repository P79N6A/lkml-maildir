Mostly correct reasoning, but the solution is wrong.  Consider what
happens if we call request_port where we have set mapbase and pre-
initialised membase for a memory mapped port (eg, PCI card.)
This would cause us to re-ioremap the mapbase, which is wrong.  We
must obey the UPF_IOREMAP flag here.  Note also that this fix you're
reverting will break 8250 for PPC people...
Could you give further information about the problem you're seeing?
Bear in mind that I know precisely zero about ia64 oopsen so you'll
probably have to explain it to me in detail.
