Ok, I'll probably use it then. How does the overhead of calling
do_gettimteofday() compare to doing an mmio read/write over PCI express?
i.e. is it going to be a performance problem if I call do_gettimeofday
for every mmio read/write?
Also, is there any good reason blk-trace doesn't use do_gettimeofday()?
