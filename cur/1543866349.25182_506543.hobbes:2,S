"attach it".  But it _isn't_ attached.  There is no memory on this node. 
We seem to be saying that we should misrepresent the physical topology
because the kernel doesn't handle it appropriately.

From this a logical step would be to change the kernel to refuse to bring
memoryless nodes online at all.
If that's not an approproate solution, then there must be a legtimate
reason for using memoryless nodes.  
Which is it?
