If Linux will use 3 bits to represent a hole (and I hope not),
please hide it in a macro. The kernel, all 1.5 million lines of
it, is a bit hard to follow when you can't hack Linux full-time.

Code that is not logical tends to exclude the part-time hackers.
Linux development works best when any intelligent person can
fix a bug. Documentation and clean code make this possible.

Coherency problems are bugs which can be tested for with debug code.
#define CHECK_BH_BITS 1

Ugh. Readable code is good.
