Ouch. It's bad for display and bad for typing.
What is easier to type?
ps -t pts/6
ps -t pts/1014962
(and yes, I really type these -- I don't have a
third hand to operate the mouse simultaneously)
What looks better?
UID        PID  PPID  C    SZ  RSS PSR STIME TTY          TIME CMD

Better way:
Have a soft limit, initially set at 99. When 2/3 of
the ptys are in use, increase the soft limit to 999,
then to 9999, 99999, and finally to 999999.
This way, a plain 1-person desktop user would never
have a pty name longer than pts/99 and an insanely
busy server could go as high as needed.
