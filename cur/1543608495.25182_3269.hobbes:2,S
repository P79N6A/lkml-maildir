XML is pretty far from light-weight.  And it's only human readable in theory.
I like the *idea*, but XML is the wrong implementation of that idea.  Other than
that I think we could agree   ;)

hehe, agreed.   The problem then is type information.
Consider:
-------------
int mf = open("/proc/meminfo/totalmem",O_RDONLY);
int32 mem;
read(mf, &mem, sizeof(mem));
-------------
Does this work ?   Yes of course.  But what if I ported my program to
a 64 bit arch...  The program still compiles.  It also runs.  But the
values are no longer correct.   Now *that* is hell.
Same story with ASCII.
I want type information.
