Heh, I actually agree, at least then the interface is complete! We can
always replace it with something more clever, should someone feel so
inclined. Here's a rough patch to do that, it's totally untested (but it
compiles). sparse will warn about the __user removal, though. I'm sure
viro would shoot me dead on the spot, should he see this...
