The only sense I can derive from it is the situation that I'm in.  We use 
cramfs partitions for lots of stuff, but one of them is to hold mirrors of 
the "default" configuration of the user-area of our device.  (Flash)  It 
makes it easy to just copy over the base partitions knowing the permisions 
will stick right.
This may not initially seem like such a great thing..., but imagine a base 
distro being distributed as a cramfs file.  Copy the thing over to your HD 
and you're done, otherwise the distro packaging has to keep track of 
permisions for each file, etc.
On the other hand..., maybe I'm being "selfish", and this is the right way to 
go.  You never write to it, so why track the write bits?  (One answer is 
maybe later we can create a writable cramfs, but oh well)  Lord knows I could 
use a few extra bits in the cramfs inode.... (Using sticky bit to denote XIP 
mode binaries right now..., such a hack)
Thanks,
Shane Nay.
