I have the same problem, with my dual core athlon64.  Booting a uniprocessor
kernel solves it.  Another work around is turning off key repeat.
Best solution is setting processor affinity for the keyboard irq handler and
X to the same cpu.  Seems to be a race condition of some sort.  If a X
developer wants to work with me to debug contact me at
ccalica_at_gmail.com.  I'm using gmane to access the list (occasionally).
Good luck.
