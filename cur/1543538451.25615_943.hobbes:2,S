I'm not sure why printk() needs to have a complicated algorithm.  Under
normal circumstances (that were pointed out above) (a) happens on boot and
there shouldn't be much problem with locks, and (b) only happens when
there's a problem so even if it is slow in this case, it's only reporting
that something went wrong (or some debugging messages that would be
removed before the code is 'published'.)  
I admit that I'm very much a newbie here, but it seems that the effort to
make a faster printk() would be better off in other areas, since, in the
best of all worlds, it wouldn't ever be used during normal operation
anyway?
