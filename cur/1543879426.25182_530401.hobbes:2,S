Its a janitorial work. I'm trying to celanup 
all the corners where ROUNDUP/DOWN & likes are defined.
Kernel.h currently has macros like ALIGN roundup DIV_ROUND_UP.
in this patch series I've added ALIGN_DOWN & round_down
[waiting for comments on the same.]
So as ALIGN macro does the same work as ROUNDUP,
      is at a common place
      & is accessible to everyone
it should be used instead...i think
