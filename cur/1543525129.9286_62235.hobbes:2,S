Looking threw code. I also looked to see if other drivers are using this
method. Yep! Some of the usb drivers. Their is code duplication here.
Instead of rewritten the code over and over perhaps we should place it
somewhere everyone can use it. Just a suggestion. I hate to rewrite the
same code over again just for my vfb driver. The question is do we place
it in mm/vmalloc.c or a seperate file.
