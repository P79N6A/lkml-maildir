I use 'make xconfig' to configure the kernel and I like it - with one very minor
gripe.  There comes a point when I'd just like to jet quickly through several of
the configuration submenus, and that starts me on a flurry of mousing about to
find those "Next" or "Prev" buttons down at the ever changing bottom of the
submenu windows.  Here's a one liner to relocate those buttons to the top of the
window and turn off the fill in the x dimension so they move about a bit less. 
There are probably other ways of achieving the same effect that have better
aesthetics, but this gets the job done.
Cheers,
Dave
