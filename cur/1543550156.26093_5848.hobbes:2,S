Yes. Actually to K&R C, since that's the language that B.S. had available to
preprocess into.
Because of Turing-equivalence of all procedural languages, it is possible
for a "compiler" for any of them to be written as a preprocess for another
language, ala f2c and p2c. (Thus the recurring search for the "universal
assembler" and many of the advantages of implementation sharing in compiler
mid-ware and backend components.) The further the languages drift the more
difficult it is to write automatic translators between them.
C++, of course, is a considerablly different language now than it was when
B.S. introduced it.
