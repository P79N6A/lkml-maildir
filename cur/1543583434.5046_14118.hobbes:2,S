On 2.2. I used the following code to get the IP address of the local machine:

If they are using masquerading, the nfct will be set.  Use
#include <linux/netfilter_ipv4/ip_conntrack.h>
enum ip_conntrack_info ctinfo;
struct ip_conntrack *ct;
ct = ip_conntrack_get(skb, &ctinfo);
if (ct) {
	/* We want the initial source. */
	ipaddr = ct->tuplehash[CTINFO2DIR(ctinfo)].tuple.src.ip;
} else {
	ipaddr = skb->nh.iph.saddr;
}
