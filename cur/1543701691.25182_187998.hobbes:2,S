  I just went digging through my old boxes for something I thought I
had.  Seems I have an old SLS Linux digribution, Release 0.99.  The date
on the postmark is June 23, 1993.  It's 30 5.25 Floppies but doesn't
list what kernel is on the floppies.  If any of the guru's think it
might be worth getting ahold of any packages on it I can see if I have a
working 5.25" floppy around somewhere.
