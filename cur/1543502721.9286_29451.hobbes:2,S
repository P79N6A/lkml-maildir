Admittedly, I have experience with only one RAID controller - Digital's
StorageWorks... but I was under the impression that RAID controllers don't
typically require drivers besides ordinary SCSI or IDE support by the
kernel.  Is this something unique to StorageWorks?  Someone please clue me
in.  It seems really dumb for a RAID controller to depend on some
proprietary interface when normal SCSI or IDE will do just fine.
