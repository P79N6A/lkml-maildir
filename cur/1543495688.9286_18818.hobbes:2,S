Well, I'm using this patch for more than 2 years now (2.0 kernels), using
various Linux Distributions (Debian, SuSE, Redhat) and have never experienced
any problems. So this should be save to patch now.
The main reason it's in /proc/mounts, is because more advanced "mount" and
"umount" (and other programs) need it (and set it in /etc/mtab).
And yes, I always symlink /etc/mtab to /proc/mounts for many reasons.
