Hi Neil,
CPU will not accept another NMI if it is already handling the NMI but in
this case only crashing CPU is in NMI. Other cpus are not and they will
accept the NMI (When crashing cpu sends NMI IPI for stopping these).
So I am not able to understand how clearing the NMI on crashing cpu is
helpful?
Thanks
