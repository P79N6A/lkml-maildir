Yes, I actually found that scripts/mkspec and scripts/kconfig/confdata.c
in the Linux source already know about /boot/config-`uname -r`, so it's
not just a Red Hat specific thing.  I didn't make enough research.
It looks like the interface to /sbin/installkernel is not very flexible as
it doesn't get .config as an argument.  Anyway, I can provide a patch to
install .config to /boot/config-`uname -r` for all architectures if
anybody is interested.
