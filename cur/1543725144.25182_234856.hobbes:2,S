Sorry, I tend to think "ppc == pmac".  So, a couple of thoughts:
(1) Can you make the i8042 disable itself if the hardware isn't there?
    Those damned bad port messages eat my entire syslog buffer.
(2) At the moment, that defconfig is also shared by us TiBook hackers.
    Would it be feasible to have a separate pmac_defconfig?  How do 
    'make menuconfig' and friends choose a defconfig if there isn't a .config?
