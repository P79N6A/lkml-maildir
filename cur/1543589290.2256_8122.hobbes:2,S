Getting the same errors here, but only a few seconds after my adaptec gets initialized and all disks/cdrs/zips get attached + mounted. On 2.4.3-ac14 it only gives these errors and happily runs afterwards. But on 2.4.4 it panics after $random time.
My setup is a P2B-S motherboard with a Quantum Fireball ST 6.4 GB HDD
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.1.11
        <Adaptec aic7890/91 Ultra2 SCSI adapter>
        aic7890/91: Wide Channel A, SCSI Id=7, 32/255 SCBs
 Vendor: QUANTUM   Model: FIREBALL ST6.4S   Rev: 0F0C
 Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
 (scsi0:A:0): 20.000MB/s transfers (20.000MHz, offset 15)
And the specific errors are
scsi0:0:0:0: Attempting to queue a TARGET RESET message
scsi0:0:0:0: Command not found
aic7xxx_dev_reset returns 8194
Device not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.
