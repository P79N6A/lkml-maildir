Those modules allow vmware itself to do a lot of clever unsafe things
behind the kernels back. So we don't have a good way to track what
vmware does. We also get a lot of vmware caused crash reports. Even with
the modules for those small bits it is impossible for anyone but the vmware
people to debug such a crash.
All I ask people to do is to not load vmware from a boot up (system or
modules) and duplicate the crash. Then I can debug it
