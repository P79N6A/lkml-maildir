Well, as davej submitted his patch he seems to just have missed a Changeset 
applied to the 2.4 tree...:
ChangeSet@1.404.2.2  2002-05-06 21:30:10-03:00  hch@infradead.org
[PATCH] memsetup fixes (again)
The mem= fixes from Red Hat's tree had a small bug:
if mem= was not actually used with the additional features, but
int plain old way, is used the value as the size of memory it
wants, not the upper limit.  The problem with this is that there
is a small difference due to memory holes.
I had one report of a person using mem= to reduce memory size for
a broken i386 chipset thaty only supports 64MB cached and the rest
as mtd/slram device for swap.  I got broken as the boundaries changed.
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c@1.42  2002-04-23 18:52:12-03:00  hch@infradead.org
So obviously this should be fixed in the 2.6 tree too!
Regards
   Thomas
P.S.: How can be assured that fixes for the 2.4 tree get into the 2.6 tree 
when they are needed there, too? I'd wonder if this missed CS is the only 
one...
