Ouch.
Ideally, you should have checked here (LM-Sensors ML) 1st.
The driver you chose has already been reworked along those lines,
and accepted by Jean Delvare, and thus slated for .19
an early copy (8/02)
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/lm-sensors/2006-August/017043.html
If youre so inclined, there are ~38 others in need
of similar attention ;)
<cp-pasted from ML thread>
Here is asb100.c... I'll add lm75, lm78, smsc47b397, and w83627hf
to this patch as I have time.  (Jean: don't apply yet.)
pc87360 (one of the larger offenders) is also now fixed.
Im sure if you ask nicely, Jean will provide you with
a current/authoritative list ;-)
http://khali.linux-fr.org/devel/i2c/linux-2.6/?M=A
has a fairly current collection and series-file (8/14/06)
Unfortunately, the series doesnt enumerate the patches
as a set, and several accepted patches arent there yet.
Jean, is this still the best/good place to keep current ?
