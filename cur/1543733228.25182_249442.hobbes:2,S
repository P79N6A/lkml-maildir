What I/O addresses are we talking about here?
There is someone working on a SD/MMC (blah blah) memory card interface
that is on LPC, using what used to be reserved as timer IO ports
(0x40 - 0x5f), and he's splitting timer ports up into 2 ranges:
0x40 - 0x43 and 0x50 - 0x53, so that the LPC ports are available.

| See previous discussion. We have isapnp, biospnp but not great acpi pnp.
| None of them help because you need to deal with hotplug.
