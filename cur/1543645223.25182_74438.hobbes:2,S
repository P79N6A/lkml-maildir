Ingo, the ksymoops patch adds these to linux/sched.h:
extern void show_trace(unsigned long *stack);
extern void show_stack(unsigned long *stack);
This is not good.  In general, it is not possible to do a reliable
backtrace with just a stack pointer as a starting point (it is
necessary to have access to the entire "preserved" machine state
instead).  I'd suggest to either change the argument to a task_struct
pointer (and update half a dozen platforms or so accordingly), or to
leave the declarations platform-specific like they were before.
Thanks,

PS: force_sig_info() still drops the siginfo pointer passed to it.
    Will you fix this soon as promised?
