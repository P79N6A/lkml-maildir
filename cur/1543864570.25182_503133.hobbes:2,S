no, but it bears repeating since some developers might think it *is*.
if you peruse the current kernel code, you'll find some tests of the
simpler form:
	((n & (n - 1)) == 0))
which is clearly testing for "power of twoness" but which will return
true for a value of zero.  that's wrong, and it's why it's emphasized
in the comment.
