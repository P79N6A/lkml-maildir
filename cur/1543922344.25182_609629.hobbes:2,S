There is a ton of evidence both in computing and outside of it which
shows that poor security can be very much worse than no security at all.
In particular stuff which makes users think they are secure but is
worthless is very dangerous indeed.
When you know that security is limited you act appropriately, when you
believe security is good but it is not you take inappropriate risks and
get badly burned.
