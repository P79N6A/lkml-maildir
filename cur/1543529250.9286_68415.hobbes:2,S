Quoting John Newman:
:Can anyone recommend a good app to stress test the memory in my
:Linux box?  I'm getting these strange lockups in a BP6 where
:the box locks hard, usually emitting a constant beep when it's 
:locked.  When I reboot it it usually doesn't come up for about
:five minutes but instead makes a beep pattern that is alternating
:a high and lower pitch beep continuously.
Funny you mention this, because it happened to me this morning for the
first time in 6 months, with 2.2.14.
:usually stays up for anywhere from a day to a week.  Not
:overclocked, happens with any kernel config and I've got my ram
:settings at the most conservative.  Also, the temperature stays
:anywhere from 29C - 34C on the CPU's and in the system as reported
:by lm_sensors and looking at logs of the temps it is never overly
:hot when it dies.
Dual Celeron config, not overclocked.  I don't have lm_sensors installed,
but when I rebooted I went to the BIOS and looked at the temperature.
It was 50C, as usual (I have 2 fans on the Celerons, but no thermal
glue, so I guess the heat does not dissipate properly--it's stable though).
I have put mem=288M in my loadlin paramerters, which is correct.  I rebooted
with mem=287M, and we'll see if I get new lockups.
It's not the first time I see those lockups, and they always happen when my
machine is having many windows opened for a while (4,5 Netscape windows,
VMWare running with 96 Mb configured, around 20 xterms).
Usually nothing in the logs, but this morning, I saw this (not on my
SMP machine, but on a remote syslog) -- the SMP machine is called "nice",
after the French town Nice, not the English adjective.

And that's it. The machine  locked up, because I don't see any new indication
of periodic cron jobs ("rmmod -a") being run on the machine past that date,
on the syslog server.
It looks like a spinlock deadlock problem happened, after the initial oops.
