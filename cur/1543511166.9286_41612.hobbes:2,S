I submitted a similar patch a couple weeks ago.  Comments:
'-march=k6' doesn't always exist.  Fall back to '-march=i586' if k6
isn't known to the compiler.
I'm not sure CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW, which enables _MMX_ code, is a win on
all K6's.  Wasn't the original K6 rather slow when doing MMX?
grep and make sure CONFIG_M586TSC isn't used in code as a conditional. 
(ie. make sure code isn't accidentally ifdef'd out, simply because
CONFIG_M586TSC is not defined)
Regards,
	Jeff
