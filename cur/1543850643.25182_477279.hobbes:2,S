As far as the "fix" of disabling the skip-ACPI-timer-override, that is 
not something that can be put in the kernel as it will break other 
boards that require the ACPI timer override not to be used (like many 
nForce2 boards for example). Breaking working setups in order to fix 
others isn't acceptable.
There are clearly some NVIDIA chipsets which require the override be 
skipped, and some which require it not be. I think the ball is currently 
in NVIDIA's court to provide a way of figuring out which chipsets 
require the quirk and which don't..
