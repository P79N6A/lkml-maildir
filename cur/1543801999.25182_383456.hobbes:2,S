But this isn't at al true. Almost all subsystems maintain the primary
tree outside of the kernel, with the kernel being the primary _stable_
tree. USB, Netdev, Alsa, etc. All changes go someplace else before being
pushed to the primary kernel tree. 99% of the time, patches are going
somewhere else before going into the main kernel. So the above
paragraphs is really misleading.
