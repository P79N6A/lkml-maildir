And the point is?
If I would kill a man it wouldn't become better by pointing out that 
other people were responsible for the killing of several million men.

You completely miss the point.
From what I forwarded it's clear that we have a bug somewhere in the 
kernel.
And the maintainer might well be right that it's not in his driver.
Which means to reassign the bug to the maintainer of the area this bug 
is in.
And in any case, being more friendly to a bug submitter.
