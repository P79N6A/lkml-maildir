I would be surprised if they had.  A more likely source of
problems would be changes in the VM subsystem (XFS metadata
buffers are cached in the page cache).

The failure you see is XFS reporting corruption in a directory
btree buffer which didn't have an appropriate magic number at
its start when read in from disk.  There's thousands of potential
reasons why that may have happened;  more often than not these
days its an error thats occured outside of XFS though, and XFS
is passing on the bad news.
If you can find a reproducible test case, you're half way there.
If you can find a reproducible test case on a kernel.org kernel,
you're 95% of the way there, cos then we can more easily help. ;)
cheers.
