	This could very well be a bug in hdparm, but when I try to set
properties of my cdrom drive, hdparm will not work unless there is a
disk in the drive:
telomere:~> hdparm /dev/hdd  
/dev/hdd: No medium found
telomere:~> hdparm -i /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd: No medium found
This didn't use to happen...
I have a normal ATAPI 12x cdrom drive on my PPro system.
