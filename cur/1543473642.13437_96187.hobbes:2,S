The missing 30k are 5% off space reserved to root.
They dont appear in df, but you can see that when you have 0 
remaining space, you can continue to write files as root until you 
reach total size.
You can set up minfree % using -m option of mke2fs while 
making your fs, or when you want using tune2fs.
Try   tune2fs -m 0 /dev/hda2
and you will recover your "vanished" space
