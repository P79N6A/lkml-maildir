This is incorrect. We will have _programmed_ the APIC with whatever the 
BIOS said in the MP tables, so if we think it's level triggered, it _is_ 
level triggered.
So I really think that all the arguments for i8259 not wanting replay 
weigh equally on level-triggered PCI irq's too.
Now, the one thing that makes me think your approach is the right one is 
that it's potentially going to be better performance - if people disable 
irq's and the normal case is that no irq will actually happen, then 
optimistically not doing anything at all (except marking the irq disabled, 
of course) is always good.
However, because it's a semantic change, I _really_ don't want to do it 
right now. We're maybe a week away from 2.6.19, and the "ISA irq's don't 
work" report is one of the things that is holding things up right now.
So that's why I'd much rather go with Eric's patch for now - because it 
keeps the semantics that we've always had.
