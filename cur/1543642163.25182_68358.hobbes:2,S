More or less what I meant - I assumed the requirement of mutual
exclusion was already agreed upon. I might have phrased it more
clearly as in "the locking protocol provides the "other" nodes with
sensible invalidation data". Something which a "budgeting" type
locking protocol would not normally do (allow each node a range of its
own for exclusive writes; everyone can read everywhere (with a bit
more locking to make the writes look atomic if they aren't already
perhaps)).

Well, SCSI can be *made* to do it (actually, this is what I had in
mind when I wrote it up) - but I don't know whether any mainstream
controllers would be able to "sniff" sensibly.
Anyway, so long,
