See the thread between Olivier Galibert & I. There are ways of doing
this which do not involve putting nfsacl code in the generic sunrpc
layer.
Either a callback or a flag in the "struct svc_program" to override the
standard RPC server reply (instead of checking the ACL program number)
would be fine as far as I'm concerned. I can't speak for Neil's
preferences, though.
I am, however, surprised when you say that Solaris has problems with
this. The PROG_MISMATCH error does also tell the client the minimum and
maximum supported version, so if all is working well, then it recognize
that we support version 3 only. It seems wierd that they should then
choose to treat that as an mount failure.
Cheers,
