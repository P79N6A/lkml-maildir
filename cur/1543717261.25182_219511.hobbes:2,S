We have done the work and are going to be ok going forward to just use
hugeltbfs directly, just mounting it with right uid,gid. the main issue
of course is the existing stuff out there and the fact that upgrades
from 2.4 to 2.6 would be a tad more nasty if we had to change so much
stuff around. it's never really a problem if we have advanced warning
and work towards stuff, it's a problem when we rely on stuff that exists
and then it gets pulled out underneath.

at least we will make the change ;)

right we did the work based on what we were given, shm_hugetlb, was
quite painless. I think the start of this problem in particular was the
bigpages hack that started 2 years ago.
