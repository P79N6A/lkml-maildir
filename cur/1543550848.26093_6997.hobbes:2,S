Alexey Kuznetsov (kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru) changed it. Ask him why he did it,
I agree with you that it would make more sense to keep the old behaviour
(even though it is differing from most other BSD sockets implementations) 
To answer your question: you'll only get the error reported now when the
UDP socket is either connect(2)ed or when you enabled asynchronous
error reporting using IP_RECVERR.
