It is a bug, not an incorrect usage.
This patch (against 2.6.19-rcX) should fix it.
Thanks,

Make sure the events count in an md array never returns to zero.
Now that we sometimes step the array events count backwards
(when transitioning dirty->clean where nothing else interesting
has happened - so that we don't need to write to spares all the time),
it is possible for the event count to return to zero, which is
potentially confusing and triggers and MD_BUG.
We could possibly remove the MD_BUG, but is just as easy, and
probably safer, to make sure we never return to zero.
