In essence, yes. The approximation was too general and vague as you have 
pointed out, and was only close to the correct ceiling or knee for one nice 
value.  I just want to formalise the relationship between the ceiling, nice 
value and INTERACTIVE_SLEEP and make the comment clear enough to be 
understood.

We're in fuzzy land where there are no absolutes I'm afraid. The common case 
is obviously nice 0 and anything else is simply respecting the relationship 
between nice and INTERACTIVE_SLEEP. As timeslices get proportionately larger 
the lower the nice value, it becomes increasingly easy to avoid getting to 
the end of a full timeslice thereby avoiding expiration anyway. It also 
doesn't take much sleep from a task to get to best priority from the priority 
knee/ceiling no matter how low it is. Finally the relationship between likely 
preemption with varying nice levels is sort of vaguely maintained. On balance 
it seems satisfactory to me to maintain this relationship.
