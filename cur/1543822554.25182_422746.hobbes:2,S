Sure - it's sad and we need some workaround.
The init_self() thingy seemed reasonable to me - it shuts up the warning
and has no runtime cost.  What we could perhaps do is to make
#define init_self(x) (x = x)
only if the problematic gcc versions are detected.  Later, if/when gcc gets
fixed up, we use
#define init_self(x)	x
Or something.  Probably a more specific name than "init_self" is needed in
this case - something that indicates that it's a specific workaround for
specific gcc versions.
