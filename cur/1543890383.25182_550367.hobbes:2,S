That is not how Linux normally operates. A BUG() doesn't panic() by
default either.
And on systems with IOMMU that is exactly the wrong thing to do.
Besides the problem is that bad drivers tend to badly abuse it
(e.g. see some particular BSD derviced SCSI drivers). We definitely
don't want any more of such code.
