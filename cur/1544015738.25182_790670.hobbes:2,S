Whever a filesystem submits a bio with the barrier flag set but
the underlying hardware doesn't support it we now get errors in
the form of:
[ 3046.442629] end_request: I/O error, dev vdb, sector 0
since commit a7384677b2f4cd40948fd7ce024ba5e1821444ba which removed
the early check on the queue capabilities in __make_request.  I
think this message is pretty annoying and confusing for the user
as the filesystems already have more descriptive warnings, e.g. for
XFS:
[ 3046.455478] Filesystem "vdb": Disabling barriers, trial barrier write failed
