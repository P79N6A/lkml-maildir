This has nothing to do with linking and ABI.  The assumptions about
continuous allocation are part of the API.  It's required by POSIX and
provided by Unix since the early days.  There are entire code bases out
there which depend on this assumption.  Linking with code like this,
before or after the new version controlled symbol is introduced, will
break it.  Policies or stateful behavior, however yo want to call it, is
just plain wrong for this (and most other things).
