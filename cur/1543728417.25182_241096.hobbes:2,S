Hi Ralf,
Thanks very much for your report.  It looks like this device is the problem:
	0000:00:06.0 Multimedia audio controller: nVidia Corporation nForce2 AC97 Audio Controler (MCP) (rev a1)
and it should get IRQ 21:
	ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [APCJ] enabled at IRQ 21
	ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:06.0[A] -> GSI 21 (level, high) -> IRQ 21
The driver for this should be intel8x0.o, and it looks like you are
loading it as a module.  Could you build it in statically to the kernel
and collect the complete dmesg from a boot with "pci=routeirq" (one
from the boot that hangs would be nice as well, but that is a pain to
collect unless you're using a serial console)?
The usual problem is that a driver looks at pci_dev->irq before calling
pci_enable_device(), but intel8x0.c seems to be doing the right thing
in this regard.
Bjorn
