	Indeed, first rule of realtime signal processing software
	writing is:  If you can't finish the computation before
	next sample arrives, you are not real-time.
	Throwing in additional tasks causing their own IRQ mask-out
	periods, and whatnot, just makes the scheduling delays worse.
	Using e.g. RT-Linux can perhaps alleviate the non-rt scheduler's
	occasionally long latencies.
