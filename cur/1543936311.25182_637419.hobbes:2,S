Hi Jens,
This patch set removes end_queued_request() and end_dequeued_request(),
which became identical by the blk-end-request patch set.
They just calls __blk_end_request() actually, so users of them are
converted to call __blk_end_request() directly.
This patch set is for the 'for-akpm' branch of your linux-2.6-block.git.
Please review and apply.
Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
