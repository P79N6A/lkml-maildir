I've done more tests. It seems that "suspend-to-ram" sequence is the
culprit. After resume, the text console is messed up. Not switching
X/console.
Boot up. Console -> X ok -> Console ok -> s2ram -> console bad -> X ok
-> console bad -> X ok.

It's suspend as indicated above.

I'll test this and get back.
Thanks,
