Hello to all,
first, I am not subscribed for too long so I might have missed a
previous post of this. But I couldn't find it in the archives (or rather on for
2.1.51-1).
With 2.4.0-test3 (i586) you can mount the same device several times on the
same mount point without getting errors. I think this is a bug as it prevents
clean unmounting if you reboot. If a partition get mounted twice and you reboot,
it will get unmounted only once and has to be checked.
Sample (... representing all the other partitions):
	~# mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb5  /mnt
	~# mount
	...
	/dev/sdb5 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
	~# mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb5  /mnt
	~# mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb5  /mnt
	~# mount
	...
	/dev/sdb5 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
	/dev/sdb5 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
	/dev/sdb5 on /mnt type ext2 (rw)
	~# umount /mnt
	~# mount
	...     # not there any more, but you can still unmount it twice
	~# umount /mnt
	~# umount /mnt
	~# umount /mnt
	umount: /mnt: not mounted
Regards,
Claudius
