I suspect that the only reason why this has not yet surfaced as a
major issue in eCryptfs is because nobody is bothering to manipulate
the eCryptfs-encrypted lower files. The only code out there right now
that can make sense of the files is in the eCryptfs kernel module.

Again, eCryptfs is fortunate in that the vast majority of users who
access the lower eCryptfs files will only want to read the encrypted
files (to do backups, for instance). I do not know of any userspace
utilities that can write correct eCryptfs lower file content.

My first instinct is to say that stacked filesystem should not even
begin to open the file if it is already opened by something other than
the stacked filesystem (-EPERM with a message in the syslog about the
problem). In the case when a stacked filesystem wants to open a file
that is already opened by something other than the stacked filesystem,
the stacked filesystem loses. Once the process closes the file, the
process is hitherto prevented from accessing the file again (via the
before-mentioned mechanism of hiding the lower namespace).

Unionfs and eCryptfs share almost exactly the same namespace
issues. Unionfs happens to be impacted by them more than eCryptfs
because of the differences in how people actually access the files
under the two filesystems.

For now, stacked filesystems just need to stay on their toes. There
are several places where assumptions need to be checked.
