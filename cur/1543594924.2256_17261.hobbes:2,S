I don't see why you think it's impossible, the only thing you need is
that your kernel module know how to discriminate the interrupt source.
You can do this also with a irq.o module and other tiny modules that
register their irq source detection code.
Then you have /dev/irqX with the following API:
- ioctl(fd, IRQ_SUBSCRIBE, source_id);
- ioctl(fd, IRQ_ACK, source_id);
- poll
- async notification
Interrupts received between notification and acknowledge are queued
(i.e. counted). An alternative to queuing (user selectable) is to block
interrupt generation at hardware level in kernel space immediately
before notification.
I'm missing something?
