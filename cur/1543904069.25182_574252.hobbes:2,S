I generally run a new release against all incoming patches on lkml for a
few days before releasing.  The latest problem ones have been caused by
a difference of opinion on what the CodingStyle means or about what the
"best" style for a few things.  Multiple initialisation etc being good
examples.
There is no way to test for "what the majority will dissagree with".
