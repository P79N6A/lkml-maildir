You missed.
All the rtnetlink messages contain a minimal fix part, followed
by variable attributes. New attributes can be added any time
not breaking anything.

624? Not a big deal.

Sorry, I am inclined against issuing lots of sequences of ioctls to get
information. This approach is fragile because you never
get a self-consistent state when state is subject to change.
Logic of rtnetlink is a bit different: you get atomic pieces of information,
which are meaningfull itself.

Not at all.
But approach which you outlined really contradicts to logic of rtnetlink yet.
It is not a select(), it is real read(). :-)

Probably. There lots of unused channels. Well, choose the best approach.
