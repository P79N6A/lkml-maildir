You're right. Even if I do know exactly how yield works and am using it to my 
advantage, any solution that depends on the way yield works may well not work 
in the future. It does look like I should just check cpu usage as well in 
prefetch_suitable(). That will probably be the best generalised solution to 
this. 
Thanks.
