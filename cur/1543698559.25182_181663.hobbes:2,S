Yes, turning off TSO with ethtool fixed it (tested on 2.6.0-test11).  At
least we have a workaround now.
Thanks Scott, Harald and Dave.
Is it not supported by the hardware?  Seems TSO could improve
performance a bit since the 1000/MT Desktop is starved for PCI bandwidth
at 32-bit/33MHz.
Thanks,
Stephen
