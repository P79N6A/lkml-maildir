Yes, it does lie. I'm the author of the O_SYNC patch for fat and vfat,
and I'd like to point out that I did test a few flash drives (and hard
drives) extensively (during about a week) with this flag, and they did
not die on me.
As other people said, I think the O_SYNC handling does exactly what it
says, and if it doesn't do what you want, tell HAL not to set it (There
must be a way).
