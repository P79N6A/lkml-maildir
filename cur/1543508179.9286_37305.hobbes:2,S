Oh hum, I'd forgotten that VFAT had those times, but it's still not sufficient.
For unix:
   mtime: The time the file was last modified.
   atime: The time the file was last accessed.
   ctime: The last time _any_ change was made to the file or inode.
   All times are to the second.
For VFAT
   mtime: The time the file was last modified (2 second resolution)
   atime: The time the file was last accessed (86400 second resolution)
   ctime: The time the file was _created_ (1ms resolution)
I suppose the unix ctime could be the max of these times.
I don't think I'd trust it enough to backup incrementally even tho it'd
pick up the commonest problem of a single mtime; unpacked zip files.
