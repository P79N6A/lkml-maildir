Even without virtualization it doesn't make much sense to know the
exact CPU speed for an user process: it never knows how much CPU time
it will get (even with real time scheduling there could be even higher
priority processes)
The solution is to call gettimeofday frequently to resychronize.
It should be cheap enough that it isn't a big issue.
