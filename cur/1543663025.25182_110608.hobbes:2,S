Two of our machines (one running 2.4.18-xfs-ipsec, one running
2.4.19-pre10-ac2)  started spitting this message before some commands
(might be in Debian procps 2.0.7-8) after an uptime of about 248 days
(certainly in the latter case, probably the same in the former).
This smells a bit as about 248 is about half of about 497, which was a 
trigger (which I managed to hit :) in the mid 2.1.x series for the uptime 
counter to wrap.
Apart from the message the machines were still running fine. I rebooted 
the 2.4.18 one recently after about 330-340 days' uptime due to a power 
outage confusing its routing. The 2.4.19-pre10-ac2 one is our mail server 
and will need rebooting sooner as this bizarre message gets mailed back to 
anyone who mails any of our majordomo lists :-/
Anyway, can't grumble. Thanks for all the uptime :)
Matt
