None from me, although the ternary ? : is a pretty odd way to write
	if (blah)
		do_this_void_function();
	else
		do_that_void_function();
so I'm in favor of that half of the patch anyway.  It's my fault for
not noticing that part of the patch in the first place.
Changing the non-void ? : constructions is just churn, but there's no
sense changing it again now that the patch is merged.
