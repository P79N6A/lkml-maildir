I consider that overengineering.  I like the idea of being able to copy 
any old foo.c into the directory and have it just picked up -- no
special makefile, no Config.in, just foo.c.
For modules more complex than a single .c file, a subdirectory with a
Makefile makes sense.  But, for example, most of Donald's network
drivers are single .c files.

For modules consisting of a single file, there is usually only one
config option: CONFIG_FOO=m.  And this is already implied by the fact
that the user copied the file into the directory.  Other config options 
are typically handled by module parameters instead.

This autodetection breaks down if you use versioned dir names -- who
needs bar-1.02.o?  Somehow I still like having extras/Makefile take
care of installation rather than extras/bar-1.02/Makefile having to do
it.  Perhaps extras/Makefile would look in turn for
${dirname}/${dirname}.o and ${dirname}/${dirname%-*}.o.  Not sure about 
that one.

Yeah, I don't know why it needs to be *totally* automatic.  Anyone who
can wield `cp' can wield `tar', given a README.  I distrust things that
untar behind my back, and I *really* distrust things that clean out old
version directories behind my back.  What if I made local
modifications?  What if I want to keep two sources around for diffing?
But either way it's a lot less hassle than driver writers have now,
where they each have to write a Makefile, figure out a way to get the
right -I/usr/src/... worry that if you compile the driver standalone
you might not have built version.h yet, etc.  (Or, like Donald does,
supply a compile command for the user to cut 'n' paste.)

I just don't like the idea of making bar-1.02/Makefile do anything it
doesn't have to.  Maybe it should include ../Rules.extra rather than
the usual $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make.  Then extras/Rules.extra would handle
"MOD_LIST_NAME := EXTRA_MODULES" und so weiter.
