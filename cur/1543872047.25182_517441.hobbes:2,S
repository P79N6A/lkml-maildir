We need it for shared file mappings (for tmpfs only).
Our scenario is:
RAM is implemented through a shared mapped file, kept on tmpfs (except by dumb 
users); various processes share an fd for this file (it's opened and 
immediately deleted).
We maintain page tables in x86 style, and TLB flush is implemented through 
mmap()/munmap()/mprotect().
Having a VMA per each 4K is not the intended VMA usage: for instance, the 
default /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count (64K) is saturated by a UML process with 
64K * 4K = 256M of resident memory.
