Thanks Artem, I got the code and did some test on my EZKIT548 with this
driver.
Here is the test log, only 2 errors in oobtest. After digging into the
mtd-nand driver code, it should be no relation to my bf5xx_nand driver.
Maybe somethings wrong in the mtd-nand code. I intend to get some help
from you, please see my test log below:

I plan to do the torture test after this oobtest passed. And this
nand_test suites are intended to integrated into our Blackfin
uClinux-dist testsuites.
Thanks a lot
