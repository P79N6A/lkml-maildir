I've had the same. I downgraded to 1.14 from RH-6.0, that one showed the
culprits into lost+found, where I zapped them with debugfs and upgraded
back.
Ted is interested in getting hold of a stack backtrace (compile it with -g,
and let it crash under gdb(1)), and of the offending file's inodes without
mucking with them. Need to find them first... ;-)
BTW, this has been what I've got with 2.3.x kernels on P2, compiled with
egcs snapshots or gcc-2.95.1 and latest binutils. One of them (2.3.20) ate
largeish parts of /usr/src and had a snack of /etc, so beware. 2.2.5-22
from RedHat-6.0 works fine on the same machine, AFAIKS. Strangely, 2.3.20
on plain Pentium doesn't show any unruly appetite.
