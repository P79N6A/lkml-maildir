    Hi Alan :))
    The patch I sent you for mmap.c, correcting a corner case,
namely the case where the requested size on a call to 'mmap()' was
greater than SIZE_MAX-PAGE_SIZE, because the size was incorrectly
page-aligned to size '0', does nothing if TASK_SIZE is the full
address space for the task. This happens, for example, under sparc64.
    This new patch covers this case and works even if TASK_SIZE is
very huge. My patch was completed by David S. Miller <davem@redhat.com>
and now should work for all cases.
    The patch is against your 2.4.20-ac1 tree. If you have any doubt,
please tell.
    Thanks ;)
    Raúl
