Nobody denied that. I'm just cautious about arguments which count
instruction cylces on a given CPU.

No problem with that. I have done this already and know about the pro
and cons. 
As I pointed out before, speed is not always the measure.
The point is configurability of features, but OTH you _cannot_ implement
a CONFIG option for each particular spinlock. You have to come down to a
certain set of config options by experimentation or by analysing ofcode
paths. Lot of work to be done though.
