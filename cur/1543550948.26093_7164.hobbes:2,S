oops, i didnt notice (really!). One comment: 5*HZ in your code is way too
much for counter, and it might break the scheduler in the future. (right
now those counter values are unused, RT priorities start at 1000, so it
cannot cause harm, but one never knows.) Please use MAX_COUNTER instead.
The SCHED_YIELD thing is a nice trick, it should be added to my signal.c
change as well, without the schedule().
