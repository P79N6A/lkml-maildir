Ok, I found some ps output of these processes in my sent-mail. (As I said
I had to boot due to the Xfree dpms lock up, so I don't have such
unkillable process in hand. Yet.)
This was with 2.2.12:
root@babbage:/dev>kill -KILL 10362
^ I tried to execute that dozens of times.
root@babbage:/dev>ps 10362
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
10362 ?        RWN    0:03 [mpg123]
root@babbage:/dev>kill -KILL 10362
root@babbage:/dev>ps -l `pidof mpg123`
  F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR    SZ WCHAN  TTY        TIME CMD
000 R  1414 10362 10361  0  62   2    -   361 -      ?          0:03 [mpg123]
And this with 2.2.13pre17:
root@babbage:/home/vherva>ps -l 17625
  F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR    SZ WCHAN  TTY        TIME CMD
000 R  1414 17625 16744  1  65   5    -  1844 -      pts/2     70:05 [enlightenm
root@babbage:/home/vherva>killall -v -9 enlightenment
Killed enlightenment(17625)
root@babbage:/home/vherva>ps -l 17625
  F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR    SZ WCHAN  TTY        TIME CMD
000 R  1414 17625 16744  1  65   5    -  1844 -      pts/2     70:05 [enlightenm
root@babbage:/home/vherva>kill -9 17625
^ (Several  times)
root@babbage:/home/vherva>ps -l 17625
  F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR    SZ WCHAN  TTY        TIME CMD
000 R  1414 17625 16744  1  65   5    -  1844 -      pts/2     70:05 [enlightenm
