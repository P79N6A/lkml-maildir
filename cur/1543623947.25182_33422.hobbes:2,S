Search mail archives for the subject [PATCH].  Note that it would be
very difficult to correlate _submitted_ patches with _accepted_ patches,
unless you had some smarts to detect that a later kernel had that patch
applied.  That is complicated by the fact that submitted and applied
patches are not always exactly the same.
Cheers, Andreas
