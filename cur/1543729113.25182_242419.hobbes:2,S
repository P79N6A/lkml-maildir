growisofs from the dvd+rw tools doesn't work either with 2.6.8, not even
with suid bit set. So it seems that the 2.6.8.1 kernel keeps normal users
from writing CDs except when setting cdrecord suid, which I read on this
list would imply "some security bugs" (I don't know if that is true or not...)
But is that really the intention with 2.6.8.1 to give all programs for cd/dvd
writing the suid bit to allow users writing cds/dvds? (while even with
that at least k3b and growisofs fail at the moment)
At least this is a major change which I guess will make almost everyone
trying this kernel run into problems with cd writing :-(
cu,
Frank
