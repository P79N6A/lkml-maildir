With my Asus P5A board I could update the BIOS by downloading the FreeDOS
installation disk, ripping all install stuff from it, and putting the
flash utilities on it.
The stuff you download from Sony is a self extracting EXE file that
contains, the flash utility, the BIOS image, and a couple of batch
files to put format a system floppy and put copy the correct stuff on
it. How inconvenient. You might be able to pull the image out of the
EXE file, it might even work within DOSemu+FreeDOS or within Wine. I
didn't try it.

BIOS updates was one of the reasons I let the XP partition exist.
Another one was the Lattice CPLD design tools.

I'd think the ACPI people are always interested in feedback, be it
positive or negative.

That's also fixed with the BIOS upgrade: it always turns the fan on in
APM mode.

If you have 2.5.9, you already have ALSA. You might want to compile it
as modules, in my experience ALSA sometimes fails to initialise the
sound device, but works when loaded the second time.

Ehm, you really don't want to be using 2.5.9 if you care about your
data. I see too many IDE problems coming by on linux-kernel that I
currently don't trust IDE support at all. Better stay with 2.4.18+acpi
or 2.4.19-pre*+acpi and ALSA.
