Sorry, still had it today;
So more works/investigation required!!!
     0     0  2325   821   0   0   1020   324  c0133119   D  8801  0:00 sync
or
     0     0  2325   821   1   0   1020   324 wait_on_dqu D   ?   0:00 sync
This time it append after the VM exited (shutdown of the VM).
During the "commit" I did sync many times and no problems, it only append after.
I know I have this "bad" habit of typing sync inconciently.
But hey, I'm used to development kernel ;-))
If you need more info, let me know I can only debug on this system until sunday then I'm gone for 3 weeks (but I might be able to connect/test remotely via vpn) but that could be a problem if it hangs... my arm won't be long enought to reach across the ocean...
