Ok, I was too lazy to check. Anyway, the test-patch is worth trying, since
one of the areas fixed had no pre-emption protection regardless (ie it
used just a plain "smp_processor_id()"), and the patch should be
technically equivalent (just uglier) to a proper get_cpu().

Yes, that was certainly the case here.
