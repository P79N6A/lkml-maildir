My apologies for the brief message.  I'm soon leaving town for a week.
Hlfsd is part of am-utils (aka Amd).  It makes the value of the symlink
different based on the euid that it gets off of RPC info (via AUTH_UNIX).
You can check the sources to it if you're interested.  Get the latest
am-utils in 
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ezk/am-utils/.
  You can find my
LISA-7 paper on hlfsd in 
http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ezk/research/.
Dave is right that Linux does it right.  As long as there's a way to ensure
that access to nfs-based symlinks can pass to the server on each user
access, I'm fine.  Most OSs don't have NFS symlink caches, and thus a simple
turning off of the attr cache works ok; that usually happens with a mount
flag (noac) or by explicitly setting the ac{dir,reg}{min,max} to 0.  But
I've seen OSs, where 0 doesn't work, and you have to set it to a small
positive number.  I've seen OSs (Solaris and Irix) where there's an explicit
nfs symlink cache, and normal attr cache mechanisms do not turn that off.
Luckily Solaris and Irix have a special mount flag to turn off nfs symlink
caching.
Also someone reported to me that at some point freebsd added symlink caches
but that their attribute turning off code got broken.  I've not verified
that with recent freebsd versions.
Erez.
