Yes, please.  I'm reading the code, and %ecx gets set to
(COMMAND_LINE_SIZE-7) which is 256-7=249.  So the upper 24 bits of
%ecx are going to always be zero, and if "edd=" isn't seen, then %ecx
will be zero when dropping into edd_mbr_sig_start.  The only other
register touched is %esi, but it's pushed at the beginning, and pop'd
on all exit cases, so that should be unchanged.
ZF is the only other bit I can picture.  On the "no edd= option" path,
ZF=0 on exit.  With "edd=of" or "edd=sk", ZF=1.  But with "edd=bar",
ZF=0, which you say works too.  So that's not it...
CF is taken care of around the int13 calls already, so that's not
it...
Thanks,
Matt
