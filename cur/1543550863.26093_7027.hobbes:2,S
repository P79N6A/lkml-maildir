Hi,
  2.4.0-test9 failed to boot on my LX164 Alpha system; 2.4.0-test8 works
fine.
  It looses interrupts in the IDE probes; it is a CMD646 controller and
what appears to be happening is that it is getting the wrong IRQs; under
2.4.0-test8 we see:
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: CMD646: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 58
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: CMD646: chipset revision 1
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: CMD646: not 100% native mode: will probe
irqs later
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: CMD646: chipset revision 0x01, MultiWord
DMA Limited, IRQ workaround enabled
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel:     ide0: BM-DMA at 0x8000-0x8007, BIOS
settings: hda:pio, hdb:DMA
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel:     ide1: BM-DMA at 0x8008-0x800f, BIOS
settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: hdb: , ATAPI CDROM drive
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for
PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: hdc: IBM-DPTA-373420, ATA DISK drive
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: hdd: MATSHITADVD-ROM SR-8582, ATAPI CDROM
drive
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
Oct  7 18:19:57 tardis kernel: ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
On 2.4.0-test9 I can't easily get a log saved; however it looks like its
saying that both ide0 and ide1 are on irq 21 and then complains that it is
loosing them.
It is not unusual for PCI devices on Alpha to have IRQs > 16 (indeed my
ether is on 17).
.config on request for anyone interested.
Dave
