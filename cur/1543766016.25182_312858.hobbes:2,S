Subject: [RFC][PATCH] nameing reserved pages [1/3]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

inline functions for naming pages.
-- Kame
Adding page_type definitions and funcs for naming reserved pages.
Reserved page's information is stored into page->private.
This is a weak naming method and anyone can overwrite it. 
This information is used in /dev/memstate in following patch.
