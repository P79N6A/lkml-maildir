I think it should catch on - it is a fairly common kernel requirement.  The
max_anon thing requires it, and I am also pressing it upon the scsi guys to
handle enormous numbers of disks (depends on how they end up doing that). 
In neither case is the associated pointer needed.

File descriptors are like that too.

In this case the debug capability is getting in the way of real-world
requirements, which is not good.
idr_pre_get() is not very good IMO.  For a start, it's racy:
	idr_pre_get();
	lock();
	idr_get_new();
	unlock();
how do we know that some other CPU didn't come in and steal our
preallocation?  That's why I (buggily) converted unnamed_dev_lock from a
spinlock to a semaphore, so we could perform the preallocation under the
same locking.
It would be better, and more idiomatic if idr_get_new() were to take a gfp
mask and to perform its own allocation.  That has its own problems and if
the code is under really heavy stress one might need to emulate
radix_tree_preload()/radix_tree_preload_end(), but for most things that's a
bit over the top.
