You can send them to me if you do not trust feature-request...
Proble with your patch is that it does not look like that it will
build on 2.2.x without complaints, but I can fix that. More important
question to me is: do people really use devfs? 
And if change will not make into next WS release, I can always distribute it
from my site.
