Right, that's a bug.  Although this case shouldn't occur unless
wer have a buggy algorithm (that's why it's a WARN_ON).  But as
we're handling it anyway, we should ensure that the result is sane.
crypt: blkcipher - Fix WARN_ON handling in walk_done
When we get left-over bits from a slow walk, it means that the
underlying cipher has gone troppo.  However, as we're handling
that case we should ensure that the caller terminates the walk.
This patch does this by setting walk->nbytes to zero.
