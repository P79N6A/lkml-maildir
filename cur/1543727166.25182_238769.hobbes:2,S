Hello,
The compilation went fine, but there are some problems I can't solve :-(
I had to disable both drm (dri) and acpi to get rid from warning messages but 
still X doesn't start with the following message in it's log file:
xf86OpenSerial cannot open device /dev/psaux no such device
This wasn't a problem before. Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Remon
