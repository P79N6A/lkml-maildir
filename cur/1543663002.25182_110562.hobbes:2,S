OK, thanks.  Note that out asm-i386/unistd.h syscallX macros do it
wrong, too.
AFAICT, glibc (2.3.1) gets this wrong, and interprets 0xffffffff
return from geteuid() as an error (ie. it's not just an strace bug).
Tested by Tridge.
Paulus points out that this also means special handling on archs (PPC
and PPC64 that I know of) which set a condition code on error: this
can be sidestepped in glibc, as well.
Other archs beware.
Thanks for the clarification,
Rusty.
