This sounds like what I had in mind.

What was the recommended way for getting userspace header at last year's 
kernel summit?

Currently, it's said the kernel headers aren't suitable for userspace.
After the cleanups you propose, the kernel headers will be suitable for 
userspace (the copy steps you propose are not required, distributions 
could equally start to copy the verbatim headers again).
If everyone is working in a different direction, this is only wasting 
work.
