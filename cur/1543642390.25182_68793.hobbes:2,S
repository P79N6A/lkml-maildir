Yes. Chuck's particular example pertains to directory data, but if
we're to expand the discussion to what *should* we be doing, then we
need to consider the S_ISREG case too.

If we could do that for unlocked pages, and at the same time flush out
any pending writes, then that would be ideal. As long as the
page_count() thing is there, we *do* unfortunately have a potential
for cache corruption.

OK. I'll think about that. I'm off to France on a fortnight's vacation
now. Should leave me with a bit of free time, so once I finish the VFS
credential code, I'll try to find some time to catch up on your recent
changes...
