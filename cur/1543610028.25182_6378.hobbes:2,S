The file system cannot judge on what's needed, neither can the file
system developer.
The developer however can offer the administrator
and/or application developer the corresponding interfaces. In the sense
of portability, however, it may be rather useful to correspond to BSD
semantics, so I vote to change sync and offer dirsync -- it might be
useful to use BSD nomenclature though and offer a synonymous noasync
option (which also has dirsync semantics as laid out in this thread
before).
It does not matter whether you look at BSD or Linux man pages, either
one documents "sync - All I/O to the file system should be done
synchronously." It should behave like documented. Let's not introduce
compatibility problems by fixing the documentation.

It depends on the task. If the machine regularly reads data from an
external interface and records it to disk, like in a log, synchronous
data writes may be important.
BTW, Wietse Venema was dazzled when he got to know that Linux values its
syslog (defaults to all-synchronous writes) more than its mail (defaults
to all-asynchronous writes that not even a file fsync() rectifies).

If that's what the admin wants, let him do so.

Yes, but you cannot generalize this example.

Compatibility and reliability are good points.
