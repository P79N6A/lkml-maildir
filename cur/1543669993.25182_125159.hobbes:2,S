I also have had a problem with ck5.  I've been using the ckX kernel for
a while now, and they're great kernels.  ck4 was absolutely solid.  I've
been following the interactiveness changes in 2.5, although I don't use
it, with some interest, so I was really happy when you announced them in
ck5.  However, it broke my Evolution.  In large folders (such as LKML),
the current message jumps around randomly umong the unread messages when
I try and select the next unread message.  This does not happen with ck4
on an otherwise unchanged system (I use gentoo 1.4).  I remember
information about 2.5 breaking Evolution, but that was a long time
before these interactive fixes.  Here are my versions.  If there's
anything else you want, let me know.
