Ok, this was the kind of technical explanation I was looking for, thanks.

Ok, so if I understand correctly, the problem I had in my simple test will be 
solved by distributions once a fair scheduler goes into mainline? This is 
fine then. As long as someone (but not end users) takes care of giving the 
right priority to tasks of different nature it should work fine.
