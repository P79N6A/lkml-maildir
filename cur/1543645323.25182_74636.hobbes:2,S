Hi Ingo,
First of all, YES! I am going to start testing first thing tomorrow.

This is a problem I ran into in my "kill-BHs" project. I was wondering
if callbacks executed through keventd might have significantly
higher latency (and potential starvation) compared to IMMEDIATE_BH
driven task-queues and that might break existing drivers. Is this not 
going to be an issue ?

The cache line bouncing of global_bh_lock and net_bh_lock in
run_timer_tasklet() show up in our profiles, so getting rid of
them is a good thing (TM).

I will start testing this patch and will try to get you some numbers.
Thanks for taking this up.
Thanks
