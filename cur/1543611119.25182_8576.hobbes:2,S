Think this would be a superior naming-scheme.
However there are 2 audiences for the naming-scheme:
1. The developers, hackers (good scheme)
2. Users, Those who compile the kernel (bad scheme)
The naming-scheme you propose would make most sence for the first 
category.. but for the second (and I speak for myself).. they would not 
know that a X.X.X.2.1 would be RC1.
And one big part of changing the naming-scheme would be to get enough 
users to try out the proposed kernel to eliminate big bugs like in 
2.4.15 and 2.4.11.
Perhaps it is a PR-issue?
Then of course there is the matter of freezing development in a RC.. but 
that can be done no matter what kind of naming-scheme you use.
