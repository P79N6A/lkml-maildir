Yes, this was obvious since the first accusation. But "they"
-) didn't formulate it that way but came down with completely false (if
   not intentionally lied *from the very first day of the public
   campaign*).
-) used the Linux kernel as a - innocent - vehicle for their great
   campaign to get bought by IBM (which - for God's sake - didn't work
   out) *without* any serious and real background, evidence or anything
   else.
So it's completely up to these folks to make up for the damage they
evoked.
And yes, I can understand that "they" want to make money and get rich
(who doesn't want this?). And no, this doesn't imply any tolerance or
even understanding of the used means, the lying all the way, spreading
FUD, and all other less then serious accusations and the media show.
	Berndm, shutting now up about SCO since they are apparently dead
PS: I don't understand for what reason any (and which) entity should
    give them money (and if it's only 1$).
