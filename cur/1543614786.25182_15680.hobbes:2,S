Okay, now we have a model number: Toshiba Tecra 710CDT; I think I can 
actually get my hands on one if need be (we have one floating around 
TMTA I believe.)
I'm fairly certain the code as it exists is good.  If not, I would 
rather like to add a WBINVD (which needs to be patched 
out/conditionalized on i386, sigh) in between the low write and high 
read in the A20 wait loop.
