Sorry. I think I even wrote that comment at the top of the function.
And probably the function as well :(

As Andrew says, it would need to be checked each time, because we have
nothing synchronising against free_pages at the top, or nr_free in the
loop.
We could make them both unsigned, and _add_ everything to min rather than
subtracting from free_pages?
