Notice "hung" not "hangs". This happened so far only once - when low battery 
condition triggered suspend to disk. I was not able to reproduce it after 
this running on AC.
Just in case it rings the bell for someone. This is not suspend regression 
reported earlier by Jens - I do not even have SATA nor is using libata 
drivers.
