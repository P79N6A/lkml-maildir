Ok folks, here you have it.
A patch that makes it possible to mount .d64, .d71 and .d81 disk images
from the good old Commodore-machines. You can either copy the images onto
a block-device (for instance a floppy) and mount them that way, or use the
loopback device.
1581-disks (3.5" DD disks) can also be mounted directly from a normal
PC-floppy (dunno about other platforms.)
Most of this driver is written by Dan Fandrich, I've just ported it to the
v2.2 kernels, fixed it up a little, cleaned up the code, added support for
.d71 images and made it compilable into the kernel (before it could only
be compiled as module.) Oh, and I added a Configure.help entry too...
Updates of the patch will be made available on my homepage in the Linux
area;
