Make sure you've turned off APIC mode, even for UP processors.  I'm
trying to get 2.5.70-mm3 working with SMP and I've narrowed it down to
an APIC problem.  Doesn't matter if I'm SMP or UP if I have APIC
enabled.  Booting with 'noapic' doesn't seem to help, but I'm probably
doing that part wrong.
My machine is a Dell Precision 610MT, dual 550 Mhz PIII Xeon, 440BX
chipset.  Latest BIOS from Dell, but it's a pretty stripped down one,
not much to poke at.
