Yes. However, you won't have to do this switch often. Request for
allocating a protected memory, or deallocating it, usually happens once
when you run a process, and once when you close it. Even if a poorly
written program requests byte-by-byte additional memory, grouping these
requests is rather trivial for a memory manager. Memory protection
violations are also rare in the reality, so one can afford the load.
In addition, this scheme solves one more problem: the fixed two-level
memory management - "kernelspace and userspace". Like the "root and users"
notion, it is good to some extent, but limits the system. The layered
kernel memory management scheme would have to allow tree-like memory
management, as a part of the tree-like resources management, thus allowing
both more flexibility and more control at the same time.

Yes. But if you have one hardcoded in the kernel, you run it every time,
even if you don't need it. Then, you run some other personality on top of
it, and possibly more libraries and programs to support and compensate
for the difference. All this is a platform burden. If you can use a more
lightweight approach, this will both increase productivity and simplify
things. Not speaking about all other advantages (see the original post).
