Hmm, I still don't understand why we can't lock dpm_list_mutex before the
"For each" loop (we already do something like this in device_suspend() and
device_resume()) and that would simplify things.
It seems that we can do something like this:
device_suspend:
	Lock dpm_list_mutex (from now on, new devices cannot be added)
	For each device on dpm_active, reverse
		acquire dev->sem (from now on, no new drivers can bind to dev)
		suspend(dev)
		move dev to dpm_off
device_resume:
	For each device on dpm_off
		move dev to dpm_active
		resume(dev) (this cannot fail)
		release dev->sem (allow new drivers to bind to dev)
	Unlock dpm_list_mutex (allow new devices to be added)
Greetings,
Rafael
