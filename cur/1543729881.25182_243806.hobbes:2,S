Can someone please explain to me what is the difference between
patch-kernel and ketchup?
With difference I ask for what problem they solve (and mayby how).
I know very well ketchup uses phython - thats an implementation detail.
Rationale behind the question is if we should include both patch-kernel
and ketchup in the kernel.
