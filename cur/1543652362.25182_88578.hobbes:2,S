I probably didn't state it very clearly, but that was what I was getting
at. It's the same value after a cast. As Andreas points out though, it
may not be bit-for-bit identical on machines that don't use two's
complement. That's why the conversion code cares about the format
specifiers, it seems.

Explicitly, in the scan conversion you'd do a:
  unsigned int *u = (unsigned int *) va_arg(args,long long *);
  *u = (unsigned int) converted_value;
...from wherever you get converted_value from (simple_strtoul? I haven't
looked at that routine). (The cast here is implied if left off, I'm just
being explicit.)

Almost true, as Andreas pointed out. You have to be careful that the
target you're storing to has the correctly declared type inside the
conversion routine.
