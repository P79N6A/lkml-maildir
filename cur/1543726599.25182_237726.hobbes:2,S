Well, as I explained you during OLS ... Drivers will act differently
for suspend-to-ram, suspend-to-disk, and eventually other states we
may introduce, like a system "idle" state.
Disks in general are an example (IDE beeing the one that is currently
implemented, but we'll probably have to do the same for SATA and SCSI
at one point), you want to spin them off (with proper cache flush
etc...) when suspending to RAM, while you don't when suspending to
disk, as you really don't want them to be spun up again right away to
write the suspend image.
USB is another example. Typically, suspend-to-RAM wants to do a bus
suspend, eventually enabling remote wakeup on some devices, and expects
to recover the bus on wakeup, while suspend-to-disk is roughtly
equivalent to a full shutdown & reconnect on wakeup.
I have other platform drivers that will behave differently. Most of the
time the difference is that suspend-to-disk will not bother actually
shutting down the HW, just freeze the state of the device, while suspend
to RAM will actually want to enter whatever D state is appropriate.

No, I don't agree. It's a driver policy to decide what PCI state
to use based on the system suspend level.
