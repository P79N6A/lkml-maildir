Actually it is not exactly same code. i386 and x86_64 use __pa_symbol()
and powerpc uses __pa() for determining physical address associated with
a kernel text symbol. That's the precise intent here. Leave it to arch
code to decide how to calculate physical address associated with a kernel
symbol.

As code is not exactly same, we can't put it in asm-generic/suspend.h.
