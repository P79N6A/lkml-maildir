Why isn't inittab in the kernel tarball?
I have a shell script that initializes /dev.  (I've posted it here a few 
times, somebody ported it to C, and a micro-udev replacement will go into 
busybox in 1.2.)
Why isn't there a command shell in the kernel tarball?  Kinda hard to use your 
system without a shell...
As far as I can tell, what broke with udev was their embedded version of 
"libsysfs", which is an abstraction layer I've _never_ understood the point 
of.  (Because opening single value files in /sys is just too hard.  Nobody 
needed a "libproc", the parsing of which is actual work, but they felt a need 
a libsysfs.  Uh-huh...)
