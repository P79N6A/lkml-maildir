I agree with your points above, except for:

This was to work around those scenarios where you want to mark an IRQ
resource as being in use prior to actually using it in much the same
way as is done with IO ports.
I've come across hardware where you need to claim the interrupt with
the controller masked, configure the device generating the interrupt
appropriately, and only then unmask it.  Otherwise you end up spinning.
To work around that, we've had to introduce additional flags into the
genirq subsystem - IRQF_NOAUTOEN - whereas separating the "obtain"
from the "start using" bit of request_irq would've made this
unnecessary.
Another example where this (was|still is) used is the IDE code, but
that's probably been cleaned up in some way now.
There's nothing wrong with keeping a combined "request_irq" for the
common case though.
