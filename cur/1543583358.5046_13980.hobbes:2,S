Wrong. The report showed a response to a command. Nothing was reported
to have been mounted through the loop device. Instead, the raw command
`mke2fs /dev/loop0` was reported. Performing such a command on early
linux versions resulted in this:
Script started on Wed Feb 28 11:10:11 2001
mke2fs /dev/loop0
mke2fs 1.19, 13-Jul-2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
mke2fs: Device size reported to be zero.  Invalid partition specified, or
	partition table wasn't reread after running fdisk, due to
	a modified partition being busy and in use.  You may need to reboot
	to re-read your partition table.
# exit
exit

This prevented you from killing the system during such a dumb command.
Later versions, resulted in the system halting with no activity. Again,
a pretty good result for such a dumb command.
