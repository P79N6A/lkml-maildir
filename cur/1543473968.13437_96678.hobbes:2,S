No.  You can also add fbdev support to XF86_SVGA.  If you want to use XAA,
it is easier this way around.

For matrox the separation is ok.  Filling one variable with the PCI-ID of
the matrox chipset and mmap()ing the MMIO area is all you have to do to
make the acceleration code work.  Yes, I've tried.
