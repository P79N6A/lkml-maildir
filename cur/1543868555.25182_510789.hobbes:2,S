This seems like a problem, the usb-storage thread is trying to allocate 
some memory which is ending up waiting for VM writeout, which obviously 
won't proceed since this thread is the one that needs to do this.. It 
looks like the allocation in usb_stor_bulk_transfer_sglist is done with 
GFP_NOIO, so I wonder why we're getting into this state?
