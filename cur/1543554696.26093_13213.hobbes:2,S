Well, here is another 'eject'.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <linux/cdrom.h>
int main(int arg, char *argv[])
{
    int fd;
    if(((fd = open("/dev/cdrom", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK)) > 0) ||
       (arg > 1) && ((fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK)) > 0))
    {
        if(ioctl(fd, CDROMEJECT, NULL))         /* If it failed */
        {
           (void)ioctl(fd, CDROMRESET, NULL);   /* Reset it */
           (void)ioctl(fd, CDROMEJECT, NULL);
        }
        (void)close(fd);
        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
    }
    perror("open");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
If there is no media in the drive, it fails to eject (open the tray).
open("/dev/cdrom", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK) = 3
ioctl(3, CDROMEJECT, 0)                 = 671088642 -> error = 0
ioctl(3, 0x5312, 0)                     = 0  CDROMRESET
ioctl(3, CDROMEJECT, 0)                 = 671088642
close(3)                                = 0
_exit(0)                                = ?
I don't see an ioctl for CDROMOPENTRAY so I suppose CDROMEJECT
is the correct ioctl.
The last time I used CDROMEJECT, (Linux 2.2.17), it worked if there
was no media.
