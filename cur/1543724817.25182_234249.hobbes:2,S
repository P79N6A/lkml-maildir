Subject: ACPI hang on Compaq 2199US laptop with kernel 2.6.7

If I have ACPI configured for the 2.6.7 kernel, boot hangs after the 
message "ACPI: IRQ9 SCI: Level Trigger."  If I configure the 2.6.7 
kernel without ACPI, everything is fine.
I would like to have ACPI because my laptop does not have APM.  The 
laptop model is a Compaq Presario 2199US.
