Niels Provos is working on a "hinting" poll() for Linux that uses a system
very similar to this where network devices register themselves with
poll(), and provide hints when they are ready for I/O.  Niels, maybe you
can describe your work?

that's one of many issues that worries me about aio_.  i think you should
definitely try writing a server with aio_ to see what problems you run
into.  i have lots of questions about how usable is aio_ for real
applications.
