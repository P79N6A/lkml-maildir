Did you have a look at uclinux.c, that is the one I was referring
to here?

There is one board setup supported by this that uses DiskOnChip
(the CONFIG_SH_SECUREEDGE5410 define). But your probably right,
it wouldn't need nftl.h.

OK, I'll get that fixed.

Well, it actually support for a completely different board - it
doesn't have NOR flash at all.
This code supports a wide variety of boards, with mixtures of
NOR flash and/or DiskOnChip.

Sounds good to me. The most important is the uclinux.c support.
Since that means I can get rid of the blkmem driver all together
from the uClinux patches.
Thanks
