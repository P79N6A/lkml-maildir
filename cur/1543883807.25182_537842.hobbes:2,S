Hi,
Trent Piepho wrote another patch for it, it just completes Uwe's patch
in the end.
http://linuxtv.org/hg/~tap/dst-new?cmd=changeset;node=bbdd2b53cd5c;style=gitweb
as far as I see from that patch it cleans up a memory leak which would
happen when the system tries to load the dst module if it's not
available and it also prints a message that points the user should
enable it in the kernel if needed.
It also bundles the dst and dst_ca objects to one selectable option.
So the idea remains the same.
From my side I do not see any problem with that patch, if someone else
has a problem with it please state out the reason.
