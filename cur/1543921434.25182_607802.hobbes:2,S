About being rare, when I force the VM to be more aggressive reclaiming buffer
by using the following patch:
--- linux-2.6.orig/fs/buffer.c
+++ linux-2.6/fs/buffer.c
@@ -3225,7 +3225,7 @@ void __init buffer_init(void)
 	 * Limit the bh occupancy to 10% of ZONE_NORMAL
 	 */
 	nrpages = (nr_free_buffer_pages() * 10) / 100;
-	max_buffer_heads = nrpages * (PAGE_SIZE / sizeof(struct buffer_head));
+	max_buffer_heads = 0;
 	hotcpu_notifier(buffer_cpu_notify, 0);
 }
 
I can actually cause data corruption within some seconds. So I think the
problem is real enough to be worth fixing.
I still dont fully understand what issues you have with my patch.
- it obviously fixes the problem
- I am not aware of any regression it introduces
- its small
One concern you had, was the fact that buffer heads are out of sync with 
struct pages. Testing your first patch revealed that this is actually needed
by reiserfs - and maybe others.
I can also see, that my patch looks a bit like a bandaid that cobbles the rd
pieces together.
Is there anything else, that makes my patch unmergeable in your opinion?
