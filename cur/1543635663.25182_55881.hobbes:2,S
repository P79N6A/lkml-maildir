Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.25 - Fix USER_HZ breakage on non-x86 archs

Greetings,
	The following patch adds the deprecated USER_HZ definition that was
added in 2.5.25 to include/linux/times.h for the new
jiffies_to_clock_t() macro and that is currently defined in
include/asm/param.h for i386/ppc. All architectures aside from x86 and
ppc are currently broken without USER_HZ definied and I assume we only
want a different internal kernel timer frequency for x86 right now, so
all definitions of USER_HZ in non asm-x86 param.h are set to the
predefined value of HZ.  
Also, is it correct to do HZ/USER_HZ in jiffies_to_clock_t() when the
values are identical,  or should an ifdef CONFIG_ARCH be added there for
architectures which use a different internitt
el frequency?
Thanks,
