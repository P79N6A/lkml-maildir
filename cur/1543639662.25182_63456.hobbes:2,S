At the moment, VM Regress cannot run multiple instances of the same test
(although it should be SMP safe and is written with SMP in mind) but I
plan to address that. The problem is not the code running, it's printing
out test results but I know how to address it, I just haven't implemented
it yet.
Because this is a benchmark and not a straight-forward test, another
parameter could be added called page reference delay. It would be a time a
page would be locked while it was been "transmitted" and then run multiple
instances of the test for different transmission speeds. I digress because
benchmarks like this are vapourware in VM Regress land at the moment and
I'm not prepared to discuss individual benchmarks just yet.

I understand that but I believe there is a number of benchmarks that
already demonstrate overall performance. A normal benchmark will tell you
X bytes was transmitted but won't tell you where time in the kernel was
spent and won't tell you anything about the end state of the system.
Using VM Regress, you could tell if delays were in page allocation, disk
reads, bad swap decisions etc. by running individual micro benchmarks (you
can already test __alloc_pages and mmap related routines).  A normal
benchmark won't tell you and I'm not aware of any tool that can do the
equivilant outside of stress testing. That is one of my "selling point".

ok, that is more or less what I was looking for. If I can get some sort of
indication from experienced VM developers on whether such a tool is
useful, I'll keep developing the tool. I know it doesn't do enough to be
truly useful yet. This first release was to find if there was any "What
sort of uselessness is that?", "haha, we already have all this
information" or "we don't need such data" reactions.
