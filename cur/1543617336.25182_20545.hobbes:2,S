Subject: [Q] module_init()'s order of execution?

Hello,
AFAIK, the macros module_init() and module_exit() are used both in case
a source is built-in (the code is called from the init stage) or as a
kernel module (implementing a init_module symbol).
In case 2 of /built-in/ modules (or more) I am wondering if it is
possible to know by advance the order used to call the various
module_init() entry points. Is it possible to fix this order, or to
setup a dependency between 2 module_init()?
TIA
