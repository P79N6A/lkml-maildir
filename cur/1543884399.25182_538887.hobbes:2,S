"many ... are marked __attribute__ ((unused))" is not true:
$ grep -r __attribute_used__ * | wc -l
60
$ 
static inline functions don't result in warnings.
And for global functions, it is technically impossible for gcc to figure
out whether a function has any users.
Unused static non-inline functions are the only functions resulting in 
warnings when being unused.
If we don't want gcc to emit warnings for such, we could disable them 
globally.
