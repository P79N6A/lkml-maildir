I don't want to comment on any of the technical issues about VFS etc. as
I would be completely out of my depth, however I do want to say 2 things. Firstly,
this is a feature that Samba users have been needing for many years to maintain
compatibility with NTFS and Windows clients. Microsoft no longer sell any servers
or clients without support for multiple data streams per file, and their latest
XP SP2 code *does* use this feature. Whatever the kernel issues I'm really glad
that Hans and Namesys have created something we can use to match this
functionality - soon we will need it in order to be able to exist in
a Microsoft client-dominated world.
My second point is the following. Hans - did you *really* have to reinvent
the wheel w.r.t userspace API calls ? Did you look at this work (done in 2001
for Solaris) ?

I'm complaining here as someone who will have to write portable code
to try and work on all these "files with streams" systems.
Jeremy.
