We read the specs of the chips, analyzed code, put up hypotheses and
tested them. Then read the specs again, finding new hypotheses and
tested again. Also reading what you guys sent out to lkml and reading
through the public discussions for *BSD, Darwin, XEN etc. helped.
And some colleagues discussed hypotheses and solution attempts with us.
We summarized many of our end results in a presentation that we gave
internally, and I am working on making this available online (in
addition to the paper/slides that Stefan mentions below).
The "real" paper still needs much work.
