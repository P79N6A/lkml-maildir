I appear to get nothing like this, if i pull my power out with a full
battery the PMU says I have 152 mins of battery power (which seems about
right). I even ran the battery completely flat and recharged it as
suggested when I first got the laptop.
The whole of the laptop is warm, esp. around the CPU which is hot to the
touch all the time, even when the CPU is idling.
?!?!
