Ahh. Ok. However, then the test _really_ should be something like
	sector_t maxsector, sector;
	int sector_shift = get_sector_shift(bh->b_size);
	maxsector = (~(sector_t)0) >> sector_shift;
	if (unshifted_value > maxsector)
		return -EIO;
	sector = (sector_t) unshifted_value << sector_shift;
which is a lot clearer, and likely faster too, with a proper 
get_sector_shift. Something like this:
	/*
	 * What it the shift required to turn a bh of size
	 * "size" into a 512-byte sector count?
	 */
	static inline int get_sector_shift(unsigned int size)
	{
		int shift = -1;
		unsigned int n = 256;
		do {
			shift++;
		} while ((n += n) < size);
		return shift;
	}
which should generate good code on just about any architecture (it avoids 
actually using shifts on purpose), and I think the end result will end up 
being more readable (I'm not claiming that the "get_sector_shift()" 
implementation is readable, I'm claiming that the _users_ will be more 
readable).
Of course, even better would be to not have "b_size" at all, but use 
"b_shift", but we don't have that. And the sector shift calculation might 
be fast enough that it's even a win (turning a 64-bit multiply into a 
shift _tends_ to be better)
