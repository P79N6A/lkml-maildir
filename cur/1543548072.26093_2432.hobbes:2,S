Adam from 3ware contacted me and disputes the claims of the 3ware
technical support department.
He says that you can replace a failed drive with any drive, not
just one identical to the rest of the array.  This is helpful,
if true.
However, he did not address that rationale for considering
a Maxtor 53073H6 so different from a Maxtor 53073U6 so as to
refuse to use them to build an array.
He did claim that a change is in the works, that I assume may
address my concerns.
