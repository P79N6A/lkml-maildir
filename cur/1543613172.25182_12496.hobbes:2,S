There isn't, but you can create an UDP socket and to the query,
or run an userspace resolver daemon that talks with your
module, or some other trick.
BTW it isn't the kind of stuff to do in kernelspace.
You may think about do it in a post-processing stage
if possible, or to write a module that exports to userspace
what you need from the kernel and do the rest in userspace.
