oh, ok. But I will still get more data back then with reading through
the regular, say, /dev/hdc-device wouldn't I? As far as I know, read
will only give you data when no I/O error occured.

Really? Are you really sure about that?
Back in the old days, when I did assembly on my Atari ST, I would just
say to the controller "gimme this and that track, in RAW" and it
would do so. I thought that I could do that at least for floppy, not
sure about harddisk (RLL through ACSI interface).
