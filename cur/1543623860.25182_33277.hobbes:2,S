I find the e-diff mode in emacs quite good too.  I had a quick look at
tkdiff and it seems to be much the same sort of idea.

If your saying what I think you're saying, I completely agree.
I often run "patch" and it drops some chunk because it doesn't match,
and it turns out that the miss-match is just one or two lines in a
chunk that could be very big.
I would like a tool (actually an emacs mode) that would show me exactly
why a patch fails, and allow me to edit bits until it fits, and then
apply it.  I assume that is what you mean by "wiggle a patch into a file".

How about an editor which, when you view a file, gives you also a
little window onto that file for every other version in your current
series of change sets.
When you make a change it gets propagated forwards.  To edit a
different changeset you just choose the right little window.
So many ideas... so little time....
