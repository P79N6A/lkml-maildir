    It is not a bug. The I2C patch has changed some V4L, but it was not
commited to V4L CVS. After making the diff files from CVS to -mm, we
noticed that. Patch07 reaplyed part of the patch. Some other V4L CVS
code had already changed to new behavior.

    There's a script to eliminate this before submiting the patch... For
some reason, as you pointed, it had failed for this code... I'll review
it next time.
    This first sync patch had required so many effort, since there were
changes on both sides. I hope next time having less trouble :-)
