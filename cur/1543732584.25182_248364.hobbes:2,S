I dont see why it wouldnt work, it almost undoubtedly will work for 
NFS over TCP. And any problems to cause it to not work would be best 
taking up on the linux-nfs list in order to have a "bind to address" 
option added to knfsd.
Why would it not work?

But you must describe why it would not work. *Why*?

Why could it not be solved? And why is the answer not "ask the knfsd 
people to provide bind-to-ip option"?

But on a server, the packets that go out tend to be replies to 
requests. Or at least, the only packets of interest are replies. It's 
a rare server that just off its own bat goes and talks to clients 
which have not communicated first with the server before.
Anyway, even if the server for some reason initiated traffic, the 
correct answer surely is "modify the server to bind to a specific 
address", no?

Right, but what does bonding (layer 2) have to do with virtual IPs 
and IP source address?
