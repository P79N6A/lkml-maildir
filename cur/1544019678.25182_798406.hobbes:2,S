One reason why I break up paragraphs like this one when cleaning up
changelogs is so that I can actually read them :(

Holy cow man, this patch is HUGE!  I don't have a clue what it does nor
how it does it.  I'd be somewhat scared to merge it into 2.6.29.  How
serious is this bug?
Please use checkpatch?  The patch attempts to add a large amount of
crap, must notably lots of lines which for some reason start with
space-space-tab-tab-tab.  I doubt if you meant to do that (editor brain
damage), and checkpatch's main purpose is to tell you about things
which you didn't mean to do.

Could use

Some places the code uses ep_is_linked(&ep->rdllist), other places it
uses open-coded list_empty().
ep_is_linked() is a fairly poor helper, really - it could be passed any
list_head at all.  I think that it would be better to do
static inline int ep_is_linked(struct epitem *ep)
{
	return !list_empty(&ep->rdllist);
}
and then use this consistently.

Please use braces around the comment and code when doing this. 
Otherwise readers can lose track of the fact that we're in a
single-statement leg of an `if' here.

Please put the braces back?  The `if' clause has them, and most people
prefer that the `else' clause have them too.  Plus they nicely enclose
the comment as well, as described above.
