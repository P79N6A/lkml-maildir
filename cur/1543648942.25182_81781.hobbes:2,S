Hey, but those can be converted, can't they? I for one would be willing to
spend the time and study this to implement it. Indeed I'll do that, unless you
object, of course.
And take a look at this:
CONFIG_PROC_FS=y
[acme@oops net-2.5]$ l net/ipv4/built-in.o
-rw-rw-r--    1 acme     acme       328783 Out 20 01:44 net/ipv4/built-in.o
CONFIG_PROC_FS=n
[acme@oops net-2.5]$ l net/ipv4/built-in.o
-rw-rw-r--    1 acme     acme       320708 Out 20 02:03 net/ipv4/built-in.o
Both with CONFIG_SMP, CONFIG_NR_CPUS=2, so almos whooping 2 pages! Almost
one third of what CONFIG_SECURITY would add! ia32! Imagine on Sparc64! 8-P
