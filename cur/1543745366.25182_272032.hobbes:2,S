Oops, yes, I screwed up.

We can't just do that, because there are programs that's assume '.'
and '..' are the first and second entries in the directory.  Yes, they
are broken and non-portable, but so are programs that depend on
d_off....
So instead what we need to do is wire '.' and '..' to have hash values
of (0,0) and (2,0), respectively, without ignoring other existing
dirents with colliding hashes.  (In those cases the programs will
break, but they are statistically rare, and there's not much we can do
in those cases anyway.)
This patch should do this.
