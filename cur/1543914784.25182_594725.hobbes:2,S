The same prompt existed in arch/i386/Kconfig without help text too but
it was later made invisible and automatic by pre-2.6.13 patch "remove
special HPET_EMULATE_RTC config option", commit
c91096d85c95c6b7fe8d7065e2aa6825e0bdaca9: "We had a user whose apps
weren't working correctly because his "rtc" wasn't working fully.  For
the sake of simplicity, it seems sensible to always enable HPET RTC
emulation."
  - So, which criteria influence whether HPET_EMULATE_RTC should be
    enabled on x86_64 or not?
  - In case that there is no compelling reason to disable it if its
    dependencies are satisfied, shouldn't it rather be invisible and
    automatic like on i386?
