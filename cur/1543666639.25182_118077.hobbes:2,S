No.  RAID copes.  If raid5 sees a write request for a block that it
already has a pending write request for, it will print a warning and
delay the second until the first complete.
In the cas in question I don't think raid5 is contributing to the
problem.  It is just provide extra information which might help point
towards the problem - i.e. it is confirming that some sort of aliasing
is happening.
