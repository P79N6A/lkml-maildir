Jan-Bernd has stumbled over this as well. There is some hardware that
actually requires atomic 64 bit accesses and is only available on 64 bit
systems, and not for PCI devices.
I'd prefer to have an ioread64 function that is only provided on CONFIG_64BIT
systems, which will mean that any driver using it needs to depend on that
option in Kconfig.
As an alternative, you can already use the readq() function that some 
architectures provide. Since linux doesn't run on 128 bit architectures,
you will not see one that can do an atomic read of that size.
