In fact _I_ agree with you and that's what we have in -mm now.  However, Pavel
apparently thinks it's too invasive, so we are considering (theoretically, for
now) a "less invasive" alternative.

The changes of the memory state by themselves are handled correctly anyway.
The problem is the state of memory after the resume must be consistent with
the data and metadata on disk and it will be consistent if there are no
changes to the on-disk data and metadata made during the suspend
_after_ the suspend image has been created.
Also, the on-disk data and metadata should be sufficient to recover the
filesystem in case the resume fails (but that's obvious).

Okay, so I was referring to ext3 and reiserfs.
