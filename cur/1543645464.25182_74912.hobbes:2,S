   Is this actually safe - suppose the machine has no tsc counter (eg old
   x86 or indeed new x86 numa, speedstep using, etc). In that case
   do_gettimeofday doesn't appear to be either IRQ safe or fast enough to
   use in this way ?
This is how netif_rx() has worked for a long time.  ATM is just
copying the input packet logic.
So why are you complaining now? :-)
