Sorry for my slow reply.
If I remember correctly PMSG_FREEZE was intended solely for stopping
activity when suspend to disk implementations are about to do their
atomic copies. I thought that ide reacts to this message by putting a
hold on queues, but doesn't otherwise do anything to prepare a drive for
a restart. If that's true, using FREEZE here isn't going to stop drives
from doing their emergency shutdown actions. Don't we need PMSG_SUSPEND
instead?
