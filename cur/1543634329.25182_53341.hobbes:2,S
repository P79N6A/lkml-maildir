What's wrong with this suggestion, from someone who believes it works?
Other than suggesting that it be hand entered instead of put in lilo?
Disabling 4M pages is unlikely to solve the problem, but (a) the poster
has tried it and I bet you haven't, and (b) all the things you suggest
require hardware action, while a boot option can be done with less effort
and chance of damage.
What you suggest is more likely to work, but I see no reason not to try
the simple fix first, with low time and effort budget.
