Apologies to Joe. I must have been tired when I typed the above. However
I'm still NACKing the patch: removing the '!= 0' altogether reduces code
legibility rather than improving it, particularly when we have that ugly
assignment.
If the intent is just to silence 'sparse', then replace with '!= NULL'.

...however doing something like the above would be altogether
preferable, since that cleans up the assignment which is the source of
the ugliness.
