I've looked over the patch, and I've got some comments....

There's no need to increase the number of blocks that might need to be
dirtied; if ext3_delete_entry() can't find the missing entry, it won't
dirty the block, so the number of blocks that might need to modified
remains constant.

Simply retrying the ext3_delete_entry() isn't sufficient, since
another ext3_add_entry() could move the directory entry again while
you're reading in the blocks as part of ext3_find_entry().  OK, that
would be pretty rare, since enough other directory adds would have
to fill up enough that another split could happen, but *is* possible.
(Surely our scheduler isn't that unfair....)
Probably a better thing to do is use a while loop, and retry as long
(a) ext3_delete_entry fails, and (b) old_dir->i_version has changed.
In practice this will probably never happen, but I'll feel better with
that change.
Anyway, I plan to make these two changes to your patch, and then
submit it to Linus.
