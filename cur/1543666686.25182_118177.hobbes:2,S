Could you send the full bus information for all devices (lspci -vv),
and the contents of /proc/iomem and /proc/ioports ?
I don't believe there's anything in my PCI updates which should have
changed the behaviour - they were touching mainly the scanning for
devices, and the way we write resources back into the hardware.  The
latter rarely happens on x86, except for cardbus devices.
