Only for stupidly designed hardware ... which you might well
be using, though I happen to never have seen anything that's
quite *that* stupid.  (There's always a first time though.)
USB has enough control flow to prevent that from happening.
If the host sends data that the peripheral isn't ready to
accept, the peripheral just refuses to accept it, and the
host will retry later.
