The decision to cripple the devio in this way was conscious. The problem
scenario with 2.4.27 and earlier was how many devices would fail if
a control and other transfer were submitted simultaneously. In other
words, when desktop components (e.g. HAL) rescanned /proc/bus/usb/devices,
some other devices would throw errors. The most notorious example
would be TEAC CD-210PU, because of how widespread and popular it is.
In other words, I crippled your application for the sake of a bunch
of users of other devices. You have to realize though, that your
concerns weren't voiced in the time and it was widely believed that
user-mode drivers did not submit several URBs at once (primarily
because the queueing in HCDs of 2.4 was a suspect).

If you do send a patch, you need to account for the serialization
somehow. The linux-usb-devel people considered a few ideas, such
as per-device blacklists and locking flags, backport of string caching
from 2.6 (to alleviate the most common case of /proc/usb/usb/devices).
But it seems to me that the best approach would be if you made
a special case for bulk+bulk and locked out control transfers somehow.
Another option is to look at an in-kernel driver architecture for
your device. What is it, anyway?
