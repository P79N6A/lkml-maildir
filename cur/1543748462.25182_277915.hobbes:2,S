Yes. See attached files. When I ran rtc_wakeup the priorities were
IRQ 8= 97
IRQ 0= 96
Dropping IRQ 8 (down to 86) below rtc_wakeup kept rtc_wakeup from 
completing any runs.

I know. I MUST KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT. I MUST KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT. I just 
didn't see how it was possible that either of the other two conditions 
could ever be false in this case and I missed the call to resched_task

I did this and latencies in the histogram dropped drastically. The 
highest latency in the histogram is 33 usecs and thus never gets high 
enough to trigger the tracing???
IRQ 8 = 97
IRQ 0 = 96
realfeel = 98
