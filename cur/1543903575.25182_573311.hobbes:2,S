I say: yes please. Even svn (which Linus dislikes very much) has cvs
keywords disabled by default. And at the same time, a patch to
CodingStyle not to include CVS tags, and a patch to checkpatch.pl
to enforce it :)

Common argument for $Id$ tags has been, that upon a problem, a user
can look into dmesg (or whatever log is appropraite - it's not
limited to the kernel) for the version string instead of figuring it
out himself (by means or rpm -q, or whatever hides it).
For the Linux kernel however, I do not think it is important, since:
- the code of a module changes faster than you can think (e.g.
  a change in the network code touched a network filesystem). Result:
  same $Id$ tag in the vendor's version AND the mainline version.
  So the tag is useless.
- you know what version you are running, mingetty usually prints it
  for you; uname -a also shows it.
- if you have a problem, people kindly ask you to bisect anyway, in
  which case $Id$ numbers become irrelevant anyway, because you got
  the git SHA1 ids.
Yep, that's pretty much it from my side. Conclusion: Remove CVS
tags from kernel.
