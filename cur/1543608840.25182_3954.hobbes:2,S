Yes. It would be a waste to have to bring in a cache-line into the L1
cache, and then only use 4 bytes of it. So it should make sense to set
this up somewhat like:
	struct local_task_struct {
		struct task_struct *tsk;
		.. other fields ..
	};
and then use the _exact_ existing infrastructure to get
"local_task_struct" instead of "task_struct", and let the compiler do
all the rest at a higher level. So we'd just rename "get_current()" to
"get_local_current()", and then do
	#define get_current()	(get_local_current()->tsk)
and people who want to know about the local task struct can use that.
