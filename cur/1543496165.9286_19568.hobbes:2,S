Wasn't this fixed for Linux a _long_ time ago?
Perl for example refuses to run a suid script unless it has been told at
compilation time that the OS has closed this hole. Red Hat's perl sure
doesn't complain when I run a suid perl script (not that I use them, of
course).
The usual fix, I believe, is to not pass the original filename as $1, but
a pipe that is connected to the original fd that was created when the
kernel opened the script to find out the interpreter's name.
Y.T.,
