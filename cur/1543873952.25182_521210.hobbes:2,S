Subject: whatever happened with "CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING"?

  a while back, i submitted a patch to remove the config option of
FORCED_INLINING, since it was allegedly scheduled for removal in june
of last year.  (it's still listed in
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt as being ready for removal
in june, 2006.)
  but, IIRC, that inspired some discussion as to whether it was ready
for removal.  was there any resolution on that?  just curious.
