Subject: spinlock recursion bug (2.6.17rc3)

I was moving a 1.2G file over an NFS mount, and wondered why
it had stalled making no progress.  Then my X session locked up
completely, however I was able to ssh in.
running free showed that it was *really* low on memory, yet
there was a ton of stuff in buffers/caches.
It sat there spinning for about 10 minutes making no progress at all
In desperation, I tried throwing away those caches with..
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
And then got this over serial console before the box locked up completely.
BUG: spinlock cpu recursion on CPU#1, rhythmbox/31182

On reboot, I tried to repeat the same operation, and it worked just fine.
