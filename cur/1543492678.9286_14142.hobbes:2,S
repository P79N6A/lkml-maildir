Yes.

Fine I understood the whole point of starting with a PGD gap and then
shrinking the size according to prev/next vmas.
But I couldn't find anything wrong in shm (except that everything there is
a tricky hack).
So I tried to reproduce the bug without shm and I am been succesfully:
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
/* try attaching a single segment to multiple addresses */
#define segsize 0x10000
#define attaches 128
#define base_addr 0x01000000
main ()
{
	int i; char* addr; char* result;
	for (i=0, addr = (char*)base_addr; i<attaches; i++, addr += segsize)
	{
		if ((result = mmap(addr, segsize,
				   PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC,
				   MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_FIXED|MAP_PRIVATE,
				   -1, 0)) != addr)
		{
			printf("not fixed %p\n", result);
			break;
		}
#if 0
		printf("%p %p\n", result, result+segsize);
#endif
		bzero(result, segsize);
	}
	for (i=0, addr = (char*)base_addr; i<attaches; i++, addr += segsize)
	{
		munmap(addr, segsize);
#if 0
		printf("%p %p\n", addr, addr+segsize);
#endif
	}
	exit(result == (char*)(-1));
}
The one above is MikeG testcase converted by me from using shm vma to
ANON|FIXED mmap vma.
And now that I understood the point (thanks to you ;) of free_pgtables() I
am been able to understand it and to find the bug. Here it is the bug-fix
for 2.2.5:

Well, while the above is the standalone-bugfix, I think that if prev is
null we just know that mm->mmap will be after our start-end space. The
same is true for next, if we have a next it will be after us. So I think
this second patch will improve the code:

 no_mmaps:

but I have not tested this second patch because it's really late and I
need to sleep some hour also this night ;).
