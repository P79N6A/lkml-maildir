Hi,
I have this mysterious 8 bit ISA card with nothing more then 2 smb-mounted
ic's
and a button. It seems to be something that should force a system memory
dump.
I think I can handle the code-writing, but since there's no documentation I
have
to find out how things are working.
Ok, the question is: does anyone know a place on the web where I can find
specifications of ISA-slots? I need to know what is supposed to be connected
to
the pins (1, 2, 6, etc.)
