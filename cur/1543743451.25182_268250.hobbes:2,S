Gets me a bunch.  The revelant ones would be:
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/K20iscsi:           if [ -e /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq ] ; then
/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/K20iscsi:               echo "1" > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
and
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:# Turn on the magic sysrq keys
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
But, what about this:
/etc/sysctl.conf:# Disables the magic-sysrq key
/etc/sysctl.conf:kernel.sysrq = 0
which I just commented out...
And this:
/etc/linuxconf/archive/Office/etc/sysctl.conf,v:kernel.sysrq = 0
But everything there is dated early 2001.  I think its filesystem
cruft nowadays, subject to being a space patrol target eventually.
