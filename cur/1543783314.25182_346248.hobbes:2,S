Well...  I would disagree with the very end of it (e.g. having on-disk
block number representation declared as __bitwise, so that it wouldn't be
mixed with __be<n> + having coversion helpers consisting of
static inline u32 foo_to_cpu(foo n)
{
	return be32_to_cpu((__force __be32)n);
}
etc. may be valid technics, assuming that these objects were passed around
enough to deserve it.
Blanket "let's rename for the sake of renaming" is a BS, of course...
