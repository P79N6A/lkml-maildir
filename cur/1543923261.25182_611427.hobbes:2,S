What makes you think it is members only?!?  NTFS-dev is not members  
only at all.  It is moderated which is a very different thing.  Most  
list members have to be approved for posting, too...  And the only  
reason it is moderated is spam filtering.  We delete 99.9% of emails  
going to the list by hand as moderators because they are all spam.   
That means the list and the list archives only contain NTFS related  
messages and not thousands of posts trying to sell you pills and what  
not...
Best regards,
	Anton
