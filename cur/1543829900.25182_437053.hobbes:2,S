drivers/scsi/ahci.c:
// XXX added herp
static int ahci_ioctl(struct scsi_device *scsidev, int cmd, void __user *arg) {
...
For some reason, I have to use an ioctl to reconfigure the controller.
This means that I don't have the "struct pci_dev *pdev" from ahci_init_one
and ahci_remove_one.
I could store a pointer to pci_dev by extending "struct ahci_host_priv",
but before doing this, I'm trying to figure out if there's a "correct"
way of finding a pci_dev from a scsi_device.
From the scsi_device, I know I can get a "struct ata_port", from there
a "struct Scsi_Host", a "struct ata_host_set" and even a generic
"struct device *".
Now all that's missing is a pointer to "struct pci_dev". Is there a function
to enumerate all "struct device", in that case I could compare
"struct pci_dev -> dev", if the pointers match, I've found it.
kind regards,
h.rosmanith
