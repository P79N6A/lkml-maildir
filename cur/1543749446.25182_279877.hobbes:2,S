I had SPINLOCK_SLEEP defined on -rc3-mm1, and have DEBUG_PREEMPT defined both
now and on the base -rc3-mm1. So at least on my box with a UP kernel, neither
of those is a problem... (SPINLOCK_SLEEP doesn't show up on -RT because of an
added Kconfig 'depends on !DEBUG_PREEMPT' the -RT patch adds).

Hmm.. best I can do is:
Dec 13 11:59:06 turing-police kernel:  <3>BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context sendmail(10011) at include/linux/rwsem.h:47
Multiple hits on rwsem.h:47, sendmail/gpg/bash, only on V0.7.31-15, nothing
X-related, and quite possibly due to my ham-handed attempt to make Ingo's
-rc2-mm3 patch apply to -rc2-mm4 myself. ;)
Most likely, the fact you have SMP/HT and I'm just on a PREEMPT-UP kernel is
what's making the difference.  There's almost certainly a '#ifdef CONFIG_SMP'
involved here somehow....
