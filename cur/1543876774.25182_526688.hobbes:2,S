Hmm no .. I currently have nsproxy having just M additional pointers, where 
M is the maximum number of resource controllers and a single dentry
pointer. As tasks get moved around in different hierarchies, new nsproxy's get 
created to point to proper objects in those hierarchies (which can be done with 
just M pointers in nsproxy). I have not considered the case of "search/reuse
nsproxy that has the combination you want" just to keep it simple, but
we should at some point in time do that.
