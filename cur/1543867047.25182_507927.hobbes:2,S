Hi,
I am not sure we would need this, could you explain what are you
trying to use input leds for?
Generally speaking leds within input subsystem are supposed to be very
simple on/off objects, mostly for reporting state of input devices
(keyboards), I am not even sure that LED_MAIL and LED_CHARGING make
much sense here. For more compex objects(blinking/different
colors/different brightness) we have a separate LED subsystem
(drivers/leds).
