So apparently that fixed it, but in general we do not allow these kinds of 
"need to have new xyz with new kernel". 
Kernels are supposed to be backwards compatible. Jean, what was it that 
changed, and why can't we just make them appear the same?
It may be that something like a sensors package isn't important enough to 
worry about (the machine still *works*, and everything else won't notice), 
but if it's a simple matter of adding some random file to /sysfs, we 
should just do it.
