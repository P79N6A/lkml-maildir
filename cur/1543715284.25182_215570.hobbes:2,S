A fixed BIOS will not have a bogus IRQ2->pin-2 mapping,
so the acpi_skip_timer_override workaround would not
find an entry to ignore, and would become a NOP.
So if
1. all nforce2 chipsets have timer connected to pin0
2. we can safely discover we're on nforce2 early enough,
   like andi did on x86_64
then we could apply the workaround automatically always
w/o any harm.
