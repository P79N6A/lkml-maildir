I looked briefly at the source code for libhd.  It consists of two
applications: hwinfo and hwscan, and a supporting library.  It has
compiled into it knowledge of all "possible" device drivers, including
the DAC960.  It has a unique of probe routine for each "possible"
device driver.  It collects information about the devices, such as disk
geometry and partition sizes.
Some of this information is collected using ioctl().  John indicated my
patch to linux 2.4's DAC driver worked.  But I think my patch makes it
only "mostly" worked, and is better because it doesn't leave the driver
in a broken state.
I think this problem needs to be fixed correctly.  I'll try to
put together a fix first for linux 2.5, and then backport it to linux 2.4.
I'll first try to get the Mylex "Global Array Manager" (GAM) software working
on a system around here.  I'll make certain it is using the pass-through
commands.  Then, I'll either try to reverse-engineer the pass-through
commands, or I'll try Christoph's suggestion of moving the
pass-through ioctl's to a new char device, and try writing a LD_PRELOAD
wrapper.
I've looked at Christoph's DAC960 patch fixing up the open method, removing
the release method and adding a media change method.  It looks OK.
I'll apply it to my local source, and begin changes from there.
I'll see if I can get something in about a week.
