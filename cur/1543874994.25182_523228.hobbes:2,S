The series is already very verbose, I don't think I can split most of
them any smaller without producing an unbuildable kernel.
I think 1 up to and including 11 are safe as houses, they shouldn't have
any effect other than to clean up the code.
The rest make functional changes, but they're all quite small, self
contained, and easily bisectable. I'd certainly like Eric to have a look
at them, but at some point I think we're just going to have to bite the
bullet and merge them, and see what we get in the way of bug reports.
cheers
