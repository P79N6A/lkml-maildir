Hello, ( I'm sorry for the length )
From the first time I installed linux
I had problems like:
sig11 with kernel compiling,
crc error on opening archives
error on casual copying of files.
It was on kernel 2.0.35.
On trying - Including the recent release of the kernel I had the same
problems,
But with 2.0.29 my computer works completely fine, but it means
I can't upgrade the kernel.
My guess all the time was that the new kernels support UDMA and my
disk don't like it, and today I proved it
when installed the 35 kernel on old disk and everything was fine.
What do you think - how can I prove that this is a disk problem
so I can exchange it?
Pavel.
Thanks.
