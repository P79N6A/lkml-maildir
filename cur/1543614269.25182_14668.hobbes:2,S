I'll weigh in on this one, basically a "me too".  The only changelog entry I 
find unsettling is "Fix more loopback deadlocks" and all I have to say about 
it is: remember what happened when Al fixed the iput bug.  I'm not suggesting 
that there was no basic idiot testing - I'm practically certain you did some 
yourself, but it would have been oh-so-nice to have an rc3 that lived for at 
least a short time on the kernel list before going to final.
By the way, great job managing this first major point release (2.4.16 doesn't 
really count ;-).
