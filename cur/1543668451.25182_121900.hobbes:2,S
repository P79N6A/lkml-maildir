           Summary: dma not enabled for IDE hard drives
    Kernel Version: 2.5.66
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bugme-janitors@lists.osdl.org
         Submitter: freelsjd@ornl.gov
Distribution: Debian/Sid
Hardware Environment: dual 2.4Ghz Xeon, SE7500CW2 MB, all Intel
                      Promise PDC20267 ATA-100 ide channels in
                      non-RAID mode
Software Environment: testing with hdparm 5.2-1 of Debian/Sid
Problem Description:
I have similar .config settings for both the 2.4.20 and the 2.5.66
kernels with the identical machine.  Under 2.4.20, I do get dma enabled 
and see good performance (Mb/s) from the hard disk I/O.  
However, under the 2.5.66 kernel, dma is not enabled and the performance 
of the hard drives is poor (~2-3 Mb/s under 2.4.20 versus ~30 Mb/s under 
2.5.66).  The "hdparm -I /dev/hda" command confirms that dma is not
enabled under 2.5.66, but is under 2.4.20.
