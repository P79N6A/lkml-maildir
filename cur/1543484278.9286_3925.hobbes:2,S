Hello all.
I've been using mdacon for a while now, and every now and then I want to
change the VTs it claims as its own. The only way I can do this AFAICT is
editing mdacon.c, change two silly params and recompile (I don't have the
RAM to afford modules). Said recompilation takes ~4h on this machine, and
my p200 is broke, so if there's an easy or simple way of putting the
variables as boot params (or even sysctls:), and you have either the time
to do it yourself, or the patience of telling me what to read so that
I could (C manual in hand) do it myself, I'd be very grateful.
While I'm at it, does anybody have a spare dx33 387 kicking around?
and 30-pin 4MB 9-chip parity memory? no? oh well...
John.
