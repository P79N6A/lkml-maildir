If it's the same as test2 then i've already tried it.  I got no 
performance gains as far as dbench is concerned.  Perhaps my block size 
is not optimal on that partition for extents.  Either way it seemed to 
make the kernel unstable and i've been trying to fix things since 
mid-day yesterday.  Been getting very strange problems, no error 
messages are reported or anything like that.
