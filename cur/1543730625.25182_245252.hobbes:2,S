Yup, the current -mm4 code assumes that if you have 6 ports in
the first region, they are 0x3f2-0x3f7.  But your BIOS reports
6 ports at 0x3f0-0x3f5.
So I guess we'll have to do something like Petr's approach of
ignoring the low three bits.  Thanks for the report.  I'll send
you a patch to try shortly.
