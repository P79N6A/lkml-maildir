Haavard,
It means your application is not capable(sic) of using the upper 32-bits
of the 64-bit capability sets supported by this newer kernel.
You might consider rebuilding the offending application linking it
against a newer version of libcap:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/libcap2/
However, it is a warning and, for any existing app that doesn't care
about newly added capabilities, the warning is benign.
Cheers
Andrew
