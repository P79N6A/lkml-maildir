That depends on the number of PCI cards plugged into the slots and how many of 
the four interrupt lines (/INTA - /INTD) are used.
However it doesn't matter.  Even if no cards are present, the array will still 
overflow because the I/O APIC init routines assign a vector to each RTE and 
run off the end of irq_vector.
