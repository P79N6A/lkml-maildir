This is not true at all.  To see what I'm referring to, download the 
module build kit from my website (
http://people.redhat.com/dledford
) and 
see how it uses box stock kernel include files from our kernel-source 
package to build *all* of the needed modules from one source tree (i386, 
i386smp, i386BOOT, i586, i586SMP, i686, i686SMP, i686enterprise).

If you look in the linux/include/linux/modversions/*.h files, you will 
see that the different RPM build package versions have all their symbols 
in those files #ifdef'ed so that you get the ones you need to match the 
running kernel (or if you trick the rhversion.h file, whichever version 
you request, see my Makefile).
