This does not work and has no chances to do. We have already discussed
this, actually. You can get reasoning from saved mailbox, I think.
To resume, proto->connect() method must not ever block.

Please don't do this, any attempt to fix the EAGAIN behavior
with hacks like this are riddled with problems.
Several patches nearly identical to your's have been submitted
in the past.
Alexey is supposed to work on support for unresolved routes, which
is the proper way to fix this problem.
