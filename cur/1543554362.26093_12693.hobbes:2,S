The above needs to get verified: it should be something like
	unsigned long *ebp = *((unsigned long **)t->esp);
	if ((void *) ebp < (void *) t)
		return 0;
	if ((void *) ebp >= (void *) t + 2*PAGE_SIZE)
		return 0;
	if (3 & (unsigned long)ebp)
		return 0;
	return *ebp;
because otherwise I guarantee that we'll eventually have a bug with a
invalid pointer reference in the debugging code and that would be bad.
