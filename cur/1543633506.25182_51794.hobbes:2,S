I agree.  One can argue these rants are just for "micro optimizations"
(although I disagree the size issue is "micro") but someone has to stay
on top of these issues...
Hot swappable CPUs is incredibly specialized and corner-cased.

It is by no means a solution, but I just posted a patch to configure
NR_CPUS... so setting it to, say, 2 on your dual box should help you
out.  On the converse, however, it introduces a default of 64 on 64-bit
boxen so it compounds the problem for users who don't tweak the
setting... something still needs to be done with the hotplug code.
