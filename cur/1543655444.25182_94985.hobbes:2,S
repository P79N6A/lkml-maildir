The current system call restart doesn't change the system call number. We just
substract two from the psw address (aka eip) and go back to user space.

Hmm, probably the best thing to do. I though about changing the return address
in the last frame of the stack but this is ugly and confuses the code. Another
flag in thread_info (_TIF_RESTART?) doesn't add any instruction on the hot
path in the system call handler and is simple enough to implement.
