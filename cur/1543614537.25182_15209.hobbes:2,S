Well, yes, as I had not said it on my previous mail, I'm not putting any
geometry or anything like that on lilo, the disk I have now working like
that is a 60Gigs Seagate Model=ST340823A which is recogniced by Linux as...
hda: 66055248 sectors (33820 MB) w/512KiB Cache, CHS=4111/255/63, UDMA(33)
Of course after using setmax I can access the hole disk.
I have also tried this on a 80 Gigs Seagate Model=ST380020A and it also
works ok.
Regards...
