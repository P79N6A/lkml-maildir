Hmm, it does something here on my nx5000... It causes 2 "bad parity
from KBD" errors and then freezes boot. But the chip is detected and I
see 
mmc0: W83L51xD id f00 at 0x248 irq 1 dma 0
message. (How do I guess right values for irq? I thought that
interference with keyboard means it uses irq 1, but it is probably not
the case, and default values did not work, too).
I'll try turning off ALSA because it actually freezes machine only
after alsa is loaded.
