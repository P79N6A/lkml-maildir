Thanks for the hint, backing out this patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.5/testing/cset/cset-stern@rowland.harvard.edu
|ChangeSet|20040525183839|17182.txt
fixes 2.6-BK for me. Both 2.6.7-rc1 and BK current spit out a bunch of:
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp1: nonzero read/write bulk status received: -2
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp1: error -2 reading from printer
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp1: error -115 reading from printer
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp1: error -115 reading from printer
...
(about ~80 of that last line) but work for me.
