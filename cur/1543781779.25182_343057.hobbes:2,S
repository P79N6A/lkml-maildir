Subject: [PATCH] i386 !NUMA node_to_cpumask broken in early boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/18/252

node_to_cpumask on non NUMA systems is broken if used before all the 
processors have been brought up as it returns cpu_online_map, as opposed 
to NUMA i386 systems which does it earlier than AP bringup. So return 
which processors responded via cpu_present_map and switch to 
cpu_online_map during normal runtime. This was found whilst testing a 
patch which does node dependent work before APs have all gone online.
