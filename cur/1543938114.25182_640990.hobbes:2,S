There are a number of laptops now that ship with solid-state disks.
These things look like normal IDE block devices to the kernel, but have
zero seek time and zero rotational latency. So here, prefetch is a waste
of memory and probably increases latency on average.
This will also be true for using prefetch on a typical embedded board
using compact flash through an IDE interface controller (extremely
common).
