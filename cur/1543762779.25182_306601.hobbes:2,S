If Andrew merged it in -mm, then it's on the right track for mainline I'd 
say. Andrew seems to be quite good at keeping the experimental/needs 
testing stuff in -mm for a while to shake out the bugs, but at the same 
time let the rest migrate onwards to Linus fairly quickly... 
If it's currently in -mm I'd just relax and wait for it to hit mainline in 
2.6.12 or 2.6.13...
