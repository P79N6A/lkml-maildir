Nope, and I probably never will, but I'm glad to be wrong about this one.

Ever heard of the Open Invention Network or the Software Freedom Law Center?
And since when did the FSF become an ally of Microsoft?  The rest of us seem 
to think the Novell deal's a minefield under GPLv2, and would just LOVE 
Microsoft to reopen the antitrust can of worms by suing somebody over Linux 
(they're still a convicted predatory monopolist, only the sentence part was 
defused)...
And yet GPLv3 was DOA until the Novell deal happened and suddenly the FSF had 
this huge thing.  Reminds me of everybody rallying behind Bush after 
September 11 to support abominations like the Patriot Act.   It's sad how 
fear makes people stop thinking.
