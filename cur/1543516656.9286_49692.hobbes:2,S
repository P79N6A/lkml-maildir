I know that.  But MS-DOS doesn't know that.  It puts the current
*local* time right on the platter, and what it reads off the platter it 
still interprets as *local* time even if it was created in the "other"
half of the year.  Even NT is that stupid -- I checked.
My patch (if I'm not mistaken) allows Linux to match those semantics,
which I agree are quite broken.  I don't know any better way to do so,
and I *have* heard from people who want this "feature".

If timezones behaved nicely, there might be a case to be made for
putting them in the kernel.  I'm trying to avoid that, as any sensible
person would.
