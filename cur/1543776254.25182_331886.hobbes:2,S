I don't really see the disadvantage.
Also, metafs means much less of a fight to get people to adopt the whole 
meta concept, because it can be done in a POSIX-compliant way which 
doesn't break tar.
File-as-dir is nice if you're using meta files, but it causes lots of 
unexpected weirdness.  I don't think metafs costs us much in 
performance, and with one or two shell scripts, it wouldn't cost us that 
much efficiency on the commandline.
But, I also like file-as-dir.  I think it might be time for a vote.
I vote metafs.
Or, maybe Hans needs to tell us which way we're going...

Which has nothing to do with whether it's done in "metafs" or not.
