Please don't use negative config options.
I'd much rather have
	bool 'IRQ balancing support' CONFIG_IRQ_BALANCE
than some "Disable IRQ balancing?" question.
Also, the explanation should probably explain that a P4 needs manual IRQ 
balancing since the P4 broke the Intel-documented round-robin behaviour.
Finally, exactly since IRQ balancing is practically required on P4-SMP, I
really don't think a CONFIG option works. It needs to be configured in on
any kernel that expects to use P4's in an SMP configuration.
In other words, I think this needs to do a dynamic disable (with the 
possible exception of a NUMA-Q machine, since that one is already a static 
config option and won't have P4's in it).
