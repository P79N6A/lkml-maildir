Ok.    Because of the module unloading issue, and because we don't have
a lot of these threads running around, the current plan is to fix
thread_create and kthread_stop so that they must always be paired,
and so that kthread_stop will work correctly if the task has already
exited.
Basically that just involves calling get_task_struct in kthread_create
and put_task_struct in kthread_stop.
I have some patches, hopefully I will start getting them out in the next day or
two.  Sorry I should have acted on this sooner, but I got a little distracted.
