the local ops has just been standardized in 2.6.22 though a patchset I
did. I would not expect the code to start using them this quickly. Or
maybe is it just that I am doing a terrible marketing job ;)

Quoting Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual
3.2 Instructions
LOCK - Assert LOCK# Signal Prefix
Causes the processor's LOCK# signal to be asserted during execution of
the accompanying instruction (turns the instruction into an atomic
instruction). In a multiprocessor environment, the LOCK# signal insures
that the processor has exclusive use of any shared memory while the
signal is asserted.
And if we take a look at some of the atomic primitives which are used in
i386 local.h:
add (for inc/dec/add/sub)
xadd
cmpxchg
All these instructions, just like any other, can be interrupted by an
external interrupt or cause a trap, exception, or fault. Interrupt
handler are executing between instructions and traps/exceptions/faults
will either execute instead of the faulty instruction or after is has
been executed. In all these cases, each instruction can be seen as
executing atomically wrt the local CPU. This is exactly what permits
asm-i386/local.h to define out the LOCK prefix for UP kernels.
I use the same trick UP kernel are using, but I deploy it in SMP
context, but I require the CPU to be the only one to access the memory
locations written to by the local ops.
Basically, since the memory location is _not_ shared across CPUs for
writing, we can safely write to it without holding the LOCK signal.

Ok, let's give a try at a clear statement:
- Variables touched by local ops must be per cpu variables.
- _Only_ the CPU owner of these variables must write to them.
- This CPU can use local ops from any context (process, irq, softirq, nmi, ...)
  to update its local_t variables.
- Preemption (or interrupts) must be disabled when using local ops in
  process context to   make sure the process won't be migrated to a
  different CPU between getting the per-cpu variable and doing the
  actual local op.
- When using local ops in interrupt context, no special care must be
  taken on a mainline kernel, since they will run on the local CPU with
  preemption already disabled. I suggest, however, to explicitly
  disable preemption anyway to make sure it will still work correctly on
  -rt kernels.
- Reading the local cpu variable will provide the current copy of the
  variable.
- Reads of these variables can be done from any CPU, because updates to
  "long", aligned, variables are always atomic. Since no memory
  synchronization is done by the writer CPU, an outdated copy of the
  variable can be read when reading some _other_ cpu's variables.
