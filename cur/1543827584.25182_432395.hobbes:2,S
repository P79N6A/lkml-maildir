Greylist those who have not subscribed. Let their email server try
again in 30 minutes. For those who are not subscribed it should not
matter if their message is delayed 30 minutes. And so far spammers
never try again. That's FAR more likely to nail spam than using SPF
as a singular measure. It doesn't even require the remote DNS
transaction to check an SPF record.
