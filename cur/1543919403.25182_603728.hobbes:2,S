Thanks for your comment.  I'll look into it, but unfortunately, most of 
our customers are running much older kernels (e.g. 2.6.9-based from 
RHEL4.x) which don't have the option, and some non-negligible number of 
them are running on non-IA platforms, whereas right now the option seems 
to be implemented only in i386 and x86_64 (correct me if I'm wrong).
Anyways, I'll try to look for a way to manually trigger NMI on their non
-IA boxes, preferably without any additional hardware.
Regards,
Ken
