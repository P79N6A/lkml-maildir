Subject: Where is ext2/3 secure delete ("s") attribute?

I happened upon the chattr command and was pleased to see that "s"
means to write zeros (or is it random data?) to the blocks of deleted
files.  Cool, except I can't see that it works.
First, deleting a large file with the "s" attribute happens far too
quickly.
Second, I can't see where any of this is implemented in the source
code (as of Red Hat's 2.4.18-17.7.x and straight 2.4.19).  The file
fs/ext2/CHANGES talks about how the zero writing was changed to
writing random data--but nothing seems to implement this.
What happened to this feature?  Was it too slow or buggy?  Did the
Federales force its removal?
(Would this be best implemented as a background scrub and I am missing
a daemon?)
Thanks,
-kb, the Kent who would like to have his notebook not be full of
easily undeletable files.
