Thanks.
MD part looks sane to me. However I would rather the
+#ifdef CONFIG_LFS
+#include <asm/div64.h>
+#else
+#undef do_div
+#define do_div(n, b)({ int _res; _res = (n) % (b); (n) /= (b); _res;})
+#endif
+
part went in linux/raid/md_k.h and defined "sector_div" (or similar)
as either do_div or ({ int _res; _res = (n) % (b); (n) /= (b); _res;})
as appropriate.
