Oops, sorry, right.
The preemptible kernel can reschedule, on average, sooner than the 
scheduling-point kernel, which has to wait for a scheduling point to roll 
around.
And while I'm enumerating differences, the preemptable kernel (in this 
incarnation) has a slight per-spinlock cost, while the non-preemptable kernel 
has the fixed cost of checking for rescheduling, at intervals throughout all 
'interesting' kernel code, essentially all long-running loops.  But by clever 
coding it's possible to finesse away almost all the overhead of those loop 
checks, so in the end, the non-preemptible low-latency patch has a slight 
efficiency advantage here, with emphasis on 'slight'.
