I've been trying to find information about the iommu=fullflush kernel switch
and was wondering if anyone had any information on what the actual
performance hit is, forcing it to write out its disk cache every write, or
whatever it does?
It must slow things down, but I was wondering how much.
Also, as this was admittedly a kludge, how far off is a more permanent
solution to the 3ware 4+gig/32bit only on a 64bit system problem?
Thanks
