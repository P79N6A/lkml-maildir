Hi Folks -
I know you all are busy with the kernel patches and stuff but I am having some
serious problems getting DHCP to work properly under kernel 2.2.13.    I have a
Linux Mandrake 6.0 distribution that came with kernel 2.2.9 on a linux box
serving as a router/gateway/firewall between my home LAN and my ISP's network. 
This machine has to ethernet cards, one if for my LAN the other is connected to
the ADSL modem leased from my provider.  My ISP uses DHCP to allocate IP
addresses to qualified NICs.  I have no problems at all using this arrangement
with the stock mandrake 6.0 (2.2.9-19mdk) kernel but I cannot get this to work
when I compile my own kernels.  With my own compiled kernels the machine boots
up fine and doesn't give me any error messages but it I look at the routing
table for the DHCP interface (eth1) the address is 0.0.0.0 and checking the
status of the eth1 using ifconfig tells me that I am receiving and transmitting
(RX/TX) packets fine but does not show a quad decimal number for an IP address.
Does anyone know what the  problem is?  This is getting is bit frustrating. 
Setting up DHCP shouldn't be this tricky.
Thanks.....
