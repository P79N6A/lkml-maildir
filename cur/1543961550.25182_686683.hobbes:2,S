The potential problem isn't while we reprogram the MTRRs, the potential
problem is mapping the SMM area uncachable.  In which case we will
make each SMM interrupt drastically slower.  Which can have all kinds of
unpleasant side effects.
If we really can mess up SMM mode that way we have a really nasty
interaction that is horrible to debug, or recognize.
Further the opportunity for this kind of fixup is small.
Newer AMD systems don't need it as they have an extra
way of specifying memory about 4G as WB.  Systems with just
the MTRRs can only use this when they have right around 4GB
because with more memory there are not enough MTRRs to leave them
non-overlapping and still mark all of memory WB.
