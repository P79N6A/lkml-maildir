Yeah, I know, I am sure there is a way of getting rid of some of those.. (i.e.
the tx functions are inside a spinlock from struct net_device.)

Not really, those macros used to change the variables hide everything from the
driver programmer. Besides those changes in procfs and sysfs which always
return 64-bits, everything else is type casted (if needed) by those macros -
depending on CONFIG_NETSTATS64.

That's what Linus said. But it is only a temporary fix.

I was thinking about making the 64-bit stats mandatory, but then I opted to
make in an option in the config. (As Linus pointed out, some people want
performance, not statistics.)
