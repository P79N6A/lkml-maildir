Nothing.
You have to understand that the kernel developers don't want to add support for doing 
things the "wrong way", even if the "wrong way" is more convenient for YOU.  In the long 
wrong, the "wrong way" will cause more trouble than it saves.
Fixing kernels bugs without rebooting the computer is not something that the kernel 
developers want to support.  Besides, that sounds like a ridiculous thing to do, anyway. 
I don't see how anyone can reasonably expect any OS to handle that.
