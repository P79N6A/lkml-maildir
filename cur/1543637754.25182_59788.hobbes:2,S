I don't know if it is a scalability issue, frankly.  It will be for
buffered writes, but for writes which wait on IO, the mechanics of
the media probably make the benefits small.  Conceivably there are
some additional merging opportunities, but it's thin.
We can do the rwsem thing, and that would be good.  But there may
be filesystems which are relying on i_sem to provide protection
against concurrent invokations of get_block(create=1), inside i_size.

OK. It'd be nice to get some benchmarks first (say, between O_DIRECT-to-blockdev
and the raw driver) to see if it's worth bothering with.
