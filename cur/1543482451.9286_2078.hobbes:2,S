I suppose it depends on how it's done... but Xenix attached shared memory 
(*not* of the mmap() variety) and semaphores into the filesystem (type 
S_IFNAM, with the type S_INSHD / S_INSEM encoded in rdev).  It was generally 
more of an annoyance than anything else, since you couldn't use the ordinary 
file calls to access them (open() got EISNAM IIRC).
That said, message queues *do* fit the file model to a considerable extent; 
one could use special flags to poll() to implement the full functionality of 
System V's msgrcv() and use select() to deal with the most common case 
(possibly with an fcntl()/ioctl() to set a desired message type mask).

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
