 i do not have the distro provided module installed so it will indeed drop
to safe graphic mode if i booted with it... truth is i allways use vanilla
kernels and i've never booted into the distro provided kernel since i upgraded
from 8.04 to 8.10

 what would be the best way to find this out?

 it is indeed a regression if the same problem have would ocurred when i tried
the -rc6 kernel i would have noticed the same behavior when trying to install
the nvidia module.
 Also 2.6.27.x estable kernels do not exhibit this behavior

 Given that this is easily reproducible i may try to biect rc6 <--> rc7...
it may take a few days though
