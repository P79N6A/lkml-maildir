: Something like that should be ok. Btw I'll soon be submitting the comx

: like this idea (it wasn't written by me, but the previus maintainer).
: 
	Is commx tied to syncppp.c somewhat? Or it is another implementation
of syncppp/cisco/FR? I would like to see the code.
	BTW, the idea of using /proc is neat, but think about dedicated
routers witout any /proc. I one time thought about the following:
	cat /etc/cosa/cs8.hex >/proc/cosa/cosa0/firmware
	echo start 0x400 >/proc/cosa/cosa0/command
	But I did not implement this because there can be small routers
without /proc.
: I'd be glad to help. The comx drivers frame-relay code (which I
: maintain, and support since february, I haven't done much with it
: though) needs a bit of redesign, since it is tied to the hardware drivers
: much more than it needs to be.
	You are welcome. I think we should do some design issues and
then start coding or adapting the existing software.
