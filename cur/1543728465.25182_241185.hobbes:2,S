Just tried on my machine:
2.6.8-rc4 fails all tests (did the test just to be sure)
2.6.8-rc4 with the "from_2.6.8-rc4_to_staircase7.I" patch and things look
pretty good:
on my hardware, I could put 60 threads too, and my shells are still very
responsive etc, and I get no slow downs with my watchdog script.
A few  strange things happened though (with 60 threads):
* after a few minutes, I got one message

>>>>>>> delta = 57
57 seconds !?! very surprising
* shortly after that, I tried to run top, or ps, and they all got stuck, I
waited a couple minutes and they were still stuck. I opened a few shells, I
could do anything but commands that enumerate the process list. After a while,
I killed the cputest program (ctrld c it), and the stucked ps/top continued
their execution.
I could not reproduce those problems ; I even rebooted the machine, but only
got one message delta of 3 every 30 minutes or so.
