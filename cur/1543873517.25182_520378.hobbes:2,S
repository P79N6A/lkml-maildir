That's *exactly* what the patches do (except it's called "arch/x86", which 
is clearly the best option - please don't use "ia" _anywhere_ except for 
"ia64", since that's the only architecture that is really "intel 
architecture").

Absolutely. I'm agreeing violently. I just suspect not a lot of people 
really looked at the patches..
