hi list,
i have a question about a sata dvd burner. if this is not the right place to
ask..please tell me
i managed to get my Plextor PX-712SA detected by changing
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/libata.h from:
#undef ATA_ENABLE_ATAPI
to
#define ATA_ENABLE_ATAPI
no i can mount cd / dvds etc.
but i am still not able to burn:
growisofs -Z /dev/sr0=Projekte.iso
	Executing 'builtin_dd if=Projekte.iso of=/dev/sr0 obs=32k seek=0'

please help me...i do not have an extra win install and i want to use my
drive.
if this gives you a hint: somebody says that this is a problem becase this
writer is internal PATA and only has an adapter to SATA...but he doesnt tell
more or have a solution. (german link:
