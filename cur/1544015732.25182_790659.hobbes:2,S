Thank you for comprehensive feedback. We're sorry it took so long to reply.
We will begin the work on a patch set against the net-next tree now and 
try to follow your formatting and functional advice.

We will do that for the updated patch set.

We will clean up the noise, redo the formatting and divide it into logical 
segments for the new patch set.

If the window is halved, (but still not at less than 4 segment), the mechanisms
will be turned off (due to the < 4 packets in flight limit). If the stream backs off
to a minimal window, the mechanisms will be turned on.
The bundling mechanism (if activated) will stay active since it relies on
the packet sizes and interarrival time, not on number of packets in flight.

We have to admit we don't quite see the problem. Since a page can never be removed
before all owners have decleared that they no longer needs it, all data will be correctly 
present. Also, since the packets are placed linearly on the queue and we don't support 
when SACK is enabled, no gaps will occur. But maybe we have misunderstood your 
comment, please let us know if that is the case.

We will look into making the calculation ua_data easier and also the cloning requirement. The check 
is there to avoid duplicate data in the case when a previous packet has been bundled with later ones. 
However, when we think about it, this might not be neccessary since bundling on retransmission is not 
allowed to bundle with packets that are yet to be sent. Thank you for pointing this out.

Thank you very much, this was placed there for a part of the development that we found out
was unecessary.

We were not aware of this and will look into the whole cloned-thin in this patch.

Good question, oversight by us, thank you for pointing it out.

Correct, except we dont collapse but bundle, will be modified and simplified in the next version of the patch.

Even though the path has problems (as shown by the need for retransmission), we still bundle as many 
packets as possible. If you are still not sure, please let us know what part of the code that is confusing.

As far as we understand this comment, you want us to do it on the application layer instead? Do you mean as a 
middleware, application-specific solution or something similar? Also, we believe doing it on the application layer 
will lead to the same delays that we try to prevent, since sent data will be delayed on the transport layer in case 
of loss.
