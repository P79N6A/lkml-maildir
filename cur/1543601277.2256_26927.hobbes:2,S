That is the wrong direction to go into.
We'll be completely screwed on NuMA with the classzone patch. I've said so
before, I'll say so again.
The basic approach of the classzone patch is _wrong_, in making global
decisions where no "globality" exists.
I bet that the improvements are from other things, not from classzone
itself. An dI will bet that if we start doing classzones, we'll regret it
a LOT in a few years.
