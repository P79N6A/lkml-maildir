Linus, that was one of the reasons why struct nameidata had been introduced
in the first place.  _And_ discussed with Peter, BTW, so I've no idea
where the hell does lookup_info come from.
Peter, Trond: please fold that stuff into struct nameidata (note that
flags are already there) and pass the pointer to it into methods.
That would have an extra benefit (also discussed before) of allowing to
bring credentials into the game - we could store them in the same place.
If we are up to changing method prototypes - let's do it properly.
