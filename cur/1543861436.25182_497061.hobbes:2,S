Indeed. If you take arbitrary content and send it out to the world
labelled as ISO8859-1, of _course_ you're likely to be corrupting it.
Far from being the cause of the problem, UTF-8 actually offers the
chance of a _solution_. Because once the Luddites catch up, it'll
largely eliminate the need for using the multitude of legacy character
sets and converting between them -- and the problem of mislabelling will
fairly much go away.
