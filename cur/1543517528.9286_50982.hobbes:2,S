If you look in linux/drivers/video you will see a bunch of fbcon-cfb*
files. Each file has console functions that do things like draw fonts into
the framebuffer. They do this pixel by pixel. With a accel wrapper those
same console functions are preformed with the cards acceleration
functions. Modern video cards have built in hardware routines to do things
like image blitting. This always the CPU to do other things instead of
these complex routines.

It wil help but not cure the problem. Even assembly optimizated routines
which will be written will not entirely cure the problem. The truth is the
only really cure for something like this is real time linux.
