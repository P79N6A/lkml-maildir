not at all, i'm not that concerned with codestyle issues as long as it is mostly
readable :). The only issue of importance is consistency along all the source
files so i'll try to keep up with the rest of ide.

Is this hwif->sg_table walk something similar to what it is being done in
ide_build_sglist() or ide_build_dmatable()?

Exactly my thoughts. On the one hand, it is important to clean up the code
before you stare at it for a magnitude of hours looking for bugs and actually this
cleanup was supposed to be really brief, to begin with, but you know how things
really work out in reality :). On the other hand, there are places in ide-cd that
are just horrible and need rewriting, besides API changes.
On a different note, i'm working on ripping out pipelining from ide-tape
since this'll make ATAPI unification a lot easier. Do you happen to have figured
out what this tape->merge_stage is supposed to do, i know it is a pipeline stage
and in all r/w requests the tape->merge_stage->bh is the buffer that
receives/sends the data to/from the device but still it looks really strange.
What i've done so far is remove the pipeline control algos and have kept the
tape->merge_stage for simplicity. In a different cycle i'll have to kick it out
too replacing it with a simple data buffer.
Any ideas?
Thanks.
