Hi all,
          If i am writing a module and after compilation i am loading it. 
After that suppose i want to access few of the funtions in the module then 
how is it possible(i am not creating a device using mknode for the module).
             is it necessary that to access a kernel module function  we need 
to create a node or device. if its not necessary then how can i access my 
module's function from user program.
