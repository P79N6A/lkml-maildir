More specifically, the "cooperating processes monopolize the cpu"
scenario is at its worst when a shell script is used to drive the bochs
simulator by single-stepping in order to generate instruction-level
boot-time traces of the execution of custom executives.
./foo.sh | bochs is the method, where the contents of foo.sh are
trivially derivable from bochs' debugging interface (a couple of
newlines and then repeating 's' indefinitely, then killing the process
by hand when the exception is observed while tail -f'ing the trace).
