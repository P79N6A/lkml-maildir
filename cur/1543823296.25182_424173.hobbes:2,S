The irq auto-detection should work with shared interrupts, but yes, it 
won't _detect_ them if they are already in use (but it's ok with them 
becoming shared later).
That said, true ISA cards obviously won't ever have a shared irq, in any 
normal circumstances.
Which is one reason why I think it would be silly to force such a driver 
to use a SA_SHIRQ flag, and would prefer to do it the other way instead 
(ie make drivers that fundamentally _require_ - as opposed to "in 
practice use" - an exclusive interrupt say so).

Yeah.
