I assumed from your description that you were running X nice 0 during all this 
testing and left the tunables from both SD and CFS at their defaults; this 
tends to have the effective equivalent of "timeslice" in CFS smaller than SD.

Thanks for that interesting testing you've done. The fluctuating cpu load and 
the apparently high idle time means there is almost certainly a bug still in 
the cpu accounting I do in update_cpu_clock. It looks suspicious to me 
already on just my first glance. Fortunately the throughput does not appear 
to be adversely affected on other benchmarks so I suspect it's lying about 
the idle time and it's not really there. Which means it's likely also 
accounting the cpu time wrongly. Which also means there's something I can fix 
and improve SD further. Great stuff, thanks!
