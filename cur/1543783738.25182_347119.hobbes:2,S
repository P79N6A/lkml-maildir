There is no logic to the above statement.  We know when a kernel is tainted and
do not try hard to debug problems when tainted .  We also know that ndiswrapper
and friends _currently_ let people use hardware that otherwise would have to run
MS stuff.  We know that 4K stacks hurt the above.  Do we really want to break working
configs just to enforce 4K stacks?  How does it hurt to make 4K the default and 
allow 8K?  What _might_ make sense is to make 8K a reason to taint the kernel.
