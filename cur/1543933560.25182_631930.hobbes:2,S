I don't think this is a safe change? subtraction is always safe (if
you think about it as 'distance'), addition isn't always safe unless
you know the range. The time_before macro will expand that out to
(effectively):
  if ( (long)(ent->last_usage + timeout) - (long)(jiffies) < 0 )
which seems to introduce an overflow condition in the first term.
Dunno, I may be wrong (happens often), but at the very least what
you've transformed it into is no longer obviously correct, and so it's
not a great change.
