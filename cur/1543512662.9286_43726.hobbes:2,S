Well, I found this way to totaly kill 2.3.21. I haven't tried with any other
versions of the kernel.
The machine is a dual PIII 450, 256 Meg ram.
When I ran the following program by itself it was killed after it had consumed
all of the memory on the machine.
But when I ran it at the same time as running another program that was using up
most of the CPU as well, BOOOOOM.
Nothing in the logs, just a solid freeze, also no ctrl-alt-del.
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <unistd.h>  
void recurse(int a, int b, int c){ 
	if(a == 1000000){
		printf("Hello");
		return;         
	}
	recurse(a,2,1);
}
int main(){  
	int i;  
	for(i=0; i<10 ; i++){
		recurse(1,2,3);
	}
}
Cheers Mof.
