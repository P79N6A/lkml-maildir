Hi,
I'm trying to use ALSA with my old sb16 in 2.5.61 and it sounds like
hell :) worked fine in 2.5.58.
When trying to use OSS emulation it almost sounds like playing a c64
tape at half speed and the mp3player chews through the song in a few
seconds and I hardly see any interrupts beeing generated for the sb16 in
/proc/interrupts. I see about 1 irq per 2 seconds.
When using native ALSA for playback it sounds almost ok but it's very
choppy, sounds like it skips ahead 0.5-1 seconds every 2 seconds or so.
Forgot to check the interruptrate when trying this.
I've reverted to OSS right now and it sounds great :)
I saw that you've made some rather large changes that went in somewhere
after 2.5.58... Do you have any idea to what might cause this?

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
