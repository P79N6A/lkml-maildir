Allow me to clarify.  A transparent encryption layer like CFS will
encrypt anything written out to a CFS mount and decrypt anything read
from a CFS mount, using the metadata associated with the source
directory.  One potential modification to something like CFS would be
to make the encryption optional; a file behind a CFS mount may or may
not be encrypted, depending on an EA set in the file in the source
directory.  If this were to apply to an entire root filesystem, then
one would want to minimize the overhead imposed by the CFS layer when
dealing with files that are not flagged as encrypted.
I have had a discussion with Steve French[1] on this topic, who has
given me some interesting insights.  In general, one of my design
goals in an encrypted filesystem is to minimize overhead for the
default (unencrypted) case.  In fs/jfs/file.c:106, the fileop read
pointer is set to generic_file_read.  This is passed the file struct,
which can contain the encrypted status of file.  If the file is marked
as encrypted, then the block can be assumed to be encrypted.  The
pages in the blocks that are read can then be placed in a scatterlist
and decrypted with the crypto code in the kernel, according to further
metadata pointed to by the file struct (cipher id, key, etc.) and
according to the credentials in the task structure.  Perhaps this
logic can be placed in a new jfs_file_read and the fileop read pointer
can point there instead; the jfs_file_read will check
filp->f_encryption->encrypted, and if it is set (unlikely()), then it
will continue with a read-and-decrypt, else it will just call
generic_file_read.  This pointer will need to get set for each
relevant function in each filesystem that supports file encryption in
this manner.

Hans has been doing some very interesting work in this area.  I am
aware of reiser4; Hans may remember having lunch with me at the
DISCEX-III conference in Washington, D.C. last year.  My booth (the
BYU Internet Security Research Lab; Trust Negotiation) was right
across from his:
http://csdl.computer.org/comp/proceedings/discex/2003/1897/02/1897toc.htm
He had a lengthy discussion with Jason Holt[2] on the implementation
of crypto in reiser4.
While I appreciate the security features that are part of reiser4, my
efforts toward filesystem encryption are aimed at a more general
level, to provide an encryption layer that will work across several
filesystems.  Perhaps we can look into unifying and abstracting the
key management, authentication, and other aspects involved in a
comprehensive filesystem encryption system, extending and using kernel
structures (struct file, kobject/sysfs, etc.) to maintain that data,
so whether someone is using reiser4, Security Enhanced ext3 (SEext3),
or Security Enhanced jfs (SEjfs)[3], the interface to userland will be
the same.
