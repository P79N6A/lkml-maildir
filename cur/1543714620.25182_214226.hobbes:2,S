I think so.  If
	(number of users * rlimit(RLIMIT_SIGPENDING) * sizeof(struct sigqueue))
is a significant proportion of available lowmem then someone screwed up.
Given that we're currently allowing 1024 sigqueues kernel-wide, it seems
reasonable to permit 128 per user, and infinity for root.  At 144 bytes
each, that's 17k of pinned memory per user.  No big deal.
In fact I'd be inclined to allow 1024 per user as a default, just to be
sure that existing installations will not break.  Think: a machine running
a single application which wants all 1024.

Me not sure either.  I've noticed that anything with "signal" in the
subject seems to cause kernel developers' "Reply" buttons to malfunction. 
Funny, that.

hrm.  I guess that's OK.  It does mean that there's a window in which the
user won't be able to queue as many signals as he expected to, but he was
doing weird stuff anyway.
It needs a comment though.

OK, but you haven't tested dropping the rlimit?
Hey, I just discovered something.  In both bash and zsh you can do
	ulimit 4 1024
and it sets RLIMIT_CORE for you.  How very sensible.
