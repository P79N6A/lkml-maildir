Hello,
- can rtc class behave as a drivers/char/rtc.c. I implemented an interface for 
myself, but it doesn't work, because there seems not to be an rtc driver to take 
control of system rtc for sending events to the interface?
- if not, is there any easy way, how to get events from rtc in kernelspace?
thanks,
