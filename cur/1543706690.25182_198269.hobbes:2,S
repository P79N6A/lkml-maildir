yes it does, and it does for 2.6.2 as well.
I did a couple of dmesg's and it looks like the usb device is not being
detected until after init is ran.  I would think that the kernel would
have done all the device detection before running init but I guess not.
Is there a way to check somewhere to make sure it is done detecting
devices?  I cannot just check to see if any of the usb/scsi stuff exists
since some systems may be booting off ide and have no usb bus enabled.
Here are a few of the lines that get added after I wait for a few seconds
in my init script:
+scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
