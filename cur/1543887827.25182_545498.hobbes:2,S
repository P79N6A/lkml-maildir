Good to here. I think the problem is fixed, then.

There aren't any that I can see - if more come up we'll deal with
them then.

xfs_io is my friend ;)
Without patch:
# touch /mnt/scratch/fred
# xfs_io -c "pwrite 0 5" -c "s" -c "pwrite 5 5" /mnt/scratch/fred
wrote 5/5 bytes at offset 0
5.000000 bytes, 1 ops; 0.0000 sec (78.755 KiB/sec and 16129.0323 ops/sec)
wrote 5/5 bytes at offset 5
5.000000 bytes, 1 ops; 0.0000 sec (542.535 KiB/sec and 111111.1111 ops/sec)
# umount /mnt/scratch; mount /mnt/scratch; ls -l /mnt/scratch/fred
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root      5 May 17 10:04 fred
#
So the second 5 byte write didn't change the file size.
With patch:
# touch /mnt/scratch/fred
# xfs_io -c "pwrite 0 5" -c "s" -c "pwrite 5 5" /mnt/scratch/fred
wrote 5/5 bytes at offset 0
5.000000 bytes, 1 ops; 0.0000 sec (76 KiB/sec and 15625.0000 ops/sec)
wrote 5/5 bytes at offset 5
5.000000 bytes, 1 ops; 0.0000 sec (610 KiB/sec and 125000.0000 ops/sec)
# umount /mnt/scratch; mount /mnt/scratch; ls -l /mnt/scratch/fred
-rw-r--r-- 1 root      root     10 May 17 09:53 fred
#
So yes, I've reproduced it and confirmed the patch fixes the problem.
Cheers,
Dave.
