I asked a couple of our benchmarking teams to try -v9.  Neither the OLTP
benchmark, nor the kernel-perf test suite found any significant
performance change.  I suspect mutex contention isn't a significant
problem for most workloads.
Has anyone found a non-synthetic benchmark where this makes a
significant difference?  Aside from btrfs, I mean.
