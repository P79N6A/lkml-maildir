It results in short read when there is partial overlap, or error if
overlap is complete.

OK. Thanks.

It is same for Netware, with minor difference that NW4 refuses 'leases' 
by default, and on NW5 it should be disabled by default, as otherwise
server can go mad when some client errors happen.

That's difference. With NCP you can have only one request in flight.
For sure on IPX and UDP, and according to Novell even on TCP.

On IPX maximum compatible block size is 1024 bytes... so reading one page
requires 4 exchanges. On UDP/TCP it is easier, but unfortunately majority
of installed servers is still IPX-only (at least I have this feedback
from users).

It would require either another kernel thread doing readahead, or I have
to submit new request from IPX/UDP data_ready callbacks (for TCP it needs
another thread without discussion, as data_ready callback documentation
says that I cannot read data/send new data directly from it... or maybe
special ncpfs bottomhalf).
