Subject: OT: Asus P3B-F MB , Can't set the divisor to any but 5.5 ?

	Hello All, I know this is offtopic & all .  But the bloody asus
	site doesn't even carry anything like this trouble .
	And I'd like a really clueful -bunch- of people to poll this one.
	I have set the Freq.'s to things other than 100Mhz .  But any
	attempt to set the divisor by the switches (yes I set the JEN
	jumper to disable) is fruitless .  The whole thing that started
	this off is the my (brand new) memory appears to -not- be
	asus-PC100 compatible .  I was getting -really- wierd hangs &
	oops & Gosh you name it its happened , including data corruption
	to a couple of files I had edited (in /etc/rc.d/ area) .
	Below is a 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' & 'dmesg'
	Highest stable core Freq. is 83Mhz * 5.5 Divisor = 456.5Mhz
	(458 is what dmesg says.)
	Has anyone else gotten around this  definate -bug- on this MB ?
	Any help much appreciated .  JimL
