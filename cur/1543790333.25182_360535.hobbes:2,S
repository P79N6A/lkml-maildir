Fair enough.

Thanks.  I was about to post a fix for this too.  It is reproducible in
the case where two threads race in the fault handler and both do
alloc_huge_page().  In that case, the loser will fail to insert his page
into the page cache and will call put_page() which has a
BUG_ON(page_count(page) == 0).

I'll agree with the above.  I am not all that committed to the current
layout and what you have here is a little closer to the thinking in my
original patch ;)

I'll agree with Ken that the last return should probably still be
VM_FAULT_MINOR.
