According to Alans changelog the 2.5-ac has a forwardport of the VIA
interrupt line patch, after some difficulties applying 2.5.64-ac3 to 
a rsynched post 2.5.64 kernel (some parts of the console changes didn't
apply cleanly) I now tried it and it shows exactly the same symptoms.
Are there more VIA patches floating aroung? A short search on google
didn't find anything particularly interesting.
Almost more annoying is that even after removing the fb support I cannot
see enough of the messages to be helpful here, neither scrolllock nor
shift-pgup help, probably also an interrupt issue though a bit seems
to go through:
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0xb6, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
