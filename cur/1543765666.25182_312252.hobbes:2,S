Hi,
I'd like to use a hpt366 ide controler card with 2 disk configure in raid1 on
the card with a 2.6.8 (from debian sarge) but impossible to find an equivalente
to ataraid module which is in 2.4.X kernel.
Is it possible to use this card with a 2.6.X kernel or I've to use a 2.4.X ?
thanks for your help
Yoann
