Historical accidents change nothing to my argument. I still don't like
to be confusing user xattrs (which is a _storage_ issue) and the
security metadata (part of a _control_ protocol).
Nor do I see a compelling need to repeat any design mistakes that CXFS
might have made in this area...

What would your expectation be for a SMACK-based client, if it mounts
from a server that turns out to be running with an SELinux security
model, or vice versa?
