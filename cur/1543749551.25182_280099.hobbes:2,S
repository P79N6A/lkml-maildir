I am ready to do the testing with the memory eater, and with "a complie in the 
background plus the memory eater". 
I'm not as good at kernel code management as Mats and did not do the 
regression tests on -bk and past -rc versions, nor can I duplicate the X hack 
on 2.6.9-rc1. But if you give me a patch against any numbered version 
(2.6.8.1, 2.6.9) or against 2.6.10-rc3 , I'll gladly test it, with probably 
no more than 24 h response time ;)
