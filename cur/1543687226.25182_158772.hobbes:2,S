I agree. In fact I'm pretty sure I said something similar a while ago.
Unlike you I didn't do any major changes, certainly none I felt were of
general interest.
This could go in 2.7, though, or possibly in 2.6.x depending on how the
powers that be feel. I think having the scheduler as a plugin is a win
in terms of having whole special-use algorithms. It would have to be
done *very* carefully to be sure it didn't add measurable overhead.
