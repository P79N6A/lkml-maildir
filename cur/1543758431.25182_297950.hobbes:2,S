This patch does some important things for memory hotplug: it explicitly
marks the different types of kernel allocations, and it separates those
different types in the allocator.  When it comes to memory hot-remove
this is certainly something we were going to have to do anyway.  Plus, I
believe there are already at least two prototype patches that do this.  
Anything that makes future memory hotplug work easier is good in my
book. :)
