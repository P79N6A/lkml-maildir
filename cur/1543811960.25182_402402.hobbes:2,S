You can't get away that easily ;-) 
First, even the enterprise distributions nowadays all use hotplug/udev
etc - for reducing the maintenance complexity, and also enterprise
systems do see a fair bit of hotplugging of new network cards, PCI
adapters, drives, or even USB attachments.
Second, sometimes my desktop is the machine I'm logging into from
remote while on the road.
The distinction isn't as clear as you think it is.
