Subject: [PATCH]: 2.6.14-rc5 arch-ixp4xx/system.h: ensure flash is readable before reboot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch was discussed before on l-a-k under the subject "ixp4xx flash:
don't twiddle chip selects?" (that thread starts with discussion of a
*different* patch, this is related, at least stylistically.)  The prior
discussion examined other possible places to do this patch (including within
the MTD driver).
The problem is that a machine reboot hangs because the attempt to read the
flash (the very first instruction fetch after the reset) fails as a result
of the flash being in a non-read (command) mode.
The problem is ARCH specific, I suspect it actually happens on any IXP4XX
system which has onboard flash which is used for a JFFS2 file system and
which does not have a hardware reset on the flash (I am told this applies to
any XScale because the reset line simply doesn't come out of the CPU chip.)
I can only confirm the problem on the NSLU2, it is intermittent (sometimes
very hard to reproduce).  I and other NSLU2/OpenSlug users have been running
with this patch in both LE and BE systems for maybe a month now and have not
seen the hang - so I'm confident of the fix.
The fix is to execute a flash reset command immediately before the reset,
the instruction fetch then works (fetches the instruction at address 0, as
opposed to the results of a flash command.)  The command address (0xAA) is
actually irrelevant - any address works just so long as the write ends up
going to the flash chip - hence the fix works for any endianness and any
flash layout.  It has been tested on LE builds where the address gets
changed to 0xA8 in the hardware.
