Someone already did.  Or, more precisely, there are platforms where
values used in 'return' above are bogus.
Shifting 1 up by sizeof(ssize_t) * 8 - 1 and subtracting one from
the result, in order to derive the maximal allowable value, might work.
I do not think that we have anything with non-8 bit bytes yet.
