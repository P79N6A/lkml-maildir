Hmm, no idea, /sys/block should not have changed with
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED=y. And it works fine for Michal and FC7.
Alan Stern mentioned the --movedev option with its customized initramfs,

Peter, any idea what it could be, that goes wrong on Andrew's box, or
how to look for what exactly is going wrong?

Seems that yellowdog uses RH's nash.
