access_process_vm already calls set_page_dirty_locked, in fact.
So things are relatively simple.
I suggested using pte_modify(pte, vma->vm_page_prot).  That is not the
right thing to do, in fact.  For private mappings, the vm_page_prot value
is always unwritable (PAGE_COPY).  So getting the right bits is tiny bit
hairier.  Either it can do:
	if (vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE)
		entry = pte_mkwrite(entry);
or it can do something branchless like:
	entry = pte_modify(entry, protection_map[vma->vm_flags & 0x7]);
Or maybe there is a more optimal formulation I haven't thought of.
Thanks,
Roland
