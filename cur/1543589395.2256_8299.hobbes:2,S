Both. When a CPU overheats, the OS implements either active (turning on a
fan) or passive (cpu throttling). If the temperature still exceeds the
critical threshold, the OS must shut down.

Once the temperature drops below the active and passive cooling thresholds,
the OS should stop its cooling measures, such as throttling.
That said, I seem to recall your laptop is doing throttling in a non-OS
visible way (BIOS) so I don't know under what circumstances it stops cpu
throttling.
