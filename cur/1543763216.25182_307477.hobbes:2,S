I don't care who merges the patches -- presumably the current system 
works just fine -- but netdev@oss.sgi.com and I should be reviewing the 
patches.

I don't see from the code that the struct net_device interface is going 
down (via dev->stop) at that point.  Am I mistaken?
Moreover, if you look at any other user of netif_msg_if{up,down}, you 
will see that it does not produce multiple lines of status register 
information opaque to anyone but the programmer.  Its not a debugging 
message, but something a user should feel comfortable enabling (if not 
enabled by default).

The above example seems more like netif_msg_tx_err() or even just KERN_ERR ?
