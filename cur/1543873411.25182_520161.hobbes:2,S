PCI grew an interrupt enable while you weren't looking: 
PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE
No idea about ARM, but almost all PCI devices made in the past few years 
support that bit.
Unless you are using a PCI Express device (maybe PCI-X too?), though, 
you cannot count on the bit's presence.  It was added in PCI 2.3 I 
think.  Older PCI devices certainly do not have this standardized bit.
