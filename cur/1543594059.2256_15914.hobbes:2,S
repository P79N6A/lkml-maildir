You mean to put "#include <linux/sched.h>" into include/linux/delay.h?
Otherwise this will not help very much on Alpha when I run into
the problem; or other architectures. :-)  Works for me and indeed
it may be a better place.

'quirks.c' was the only trouble spot which tripped compilation
after changes to it.  So I kept my patch local.

This was probably this hour when I was looking for that error. :-)

How about other architectures?  Each will need an individual treatment?

Indeed it is.  All three actually are (as I wrote).  The last one,
if not present, has a very unpleasant effect of drowning compilation
warnings in a flood as wailing happens in a header which is included
mostly everywhere.  It is very easy then to miss something where one
should pay a closer attention.
I suggested earlier some other patch for that but Alan apparently
did not like that one.  Quite possibly he was right.
