Hello!
Tonight I had a kernel panic (full hang) with the following on the console:
CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
Bank 4: b200000000070f0f
Kernel panic - not syncing: CPU context corrupt
I tried to decode this:
# ./parsemce -e 0000000000000004 -b 4 -s b200000000070f0f -a 0
Status: (4) Machine Check in progress.
Restart IP invalid.
parsebank(4): b200000000070f0f @ 0
        External tag parity error

HARDWARE ERROR. This is *NOT* a software problem!
Please contact your hardware vendor

STATUS b200000000070f0f MCGSTATUS 4
I've been searching for and found some additional info, it
looks like I'm not the first experiencing this problem:
http://kerneltrap.org/node/4993
Here ^^^ it is suggested that there was some thread about A64 MCEs
on LKML but I failed to find it so I decided to post... sorry if
it's redundant.
The kernel is 2.6.16-gentoo-r9 and the CPU is an A64 "Venice" 3500+
I can post further hw/sw environment information if req'd.
Thanks!
Regards,
Sab
