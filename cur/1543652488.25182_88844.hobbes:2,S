Bang, bang, bang ... assshoooole [hearing whispers in my ears]. Great point:
Inaky 0, Jamie 1 - this will teach me to read _three_ times on Monday
evenings. I am supposed to know all that code by heart ... oh well.

He does; grumble, grumble ... let's see ... with pipe you have an implicit
limit that controls you, the number of open files, that you also hit with
futex_fd() (in ... get_unused_fd()) - so that is covered. OTOH, with just
futex_wait(), if you are up to use one page per futex you lock on, you are
also limited by RLIMIT_NPROC for every process you lock on [asides from
wasting a lot of memory], so looks like there is another roadblock there to
control it.
Hum ... still I want to try Ingo's approach on the ptes; that is the part I
was missing [knowing that struct page * is not invariant as the pte number
... even being as obvious as it is].
