To get the filter set used by NL.linux.org:
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@nl.linux.org:/home/CVS login
password: cvs
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@nl.linux.org:/home/CVS checkout spamfilter
You can also use the regexps and the script in this CVS tree to
build your own majordomo.cf automatically whenever new regexps
get added.
regards,
Rik
