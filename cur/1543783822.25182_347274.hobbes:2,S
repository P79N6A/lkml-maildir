that's specious... they can put "supported by Linux" on their products by 
supplying a binary-only driver too... ndiswrapper is orthogonal to that 
problem.
on a tangent... has there been any further research/work on page 
clustering?  wli's patches haven't been updated in a while... it's another 
way to supply larger stacks.  (hell with 16KiB "pages" i'd be stoked to 
"waste" the bottom 4KiB of each stack with an unmapped page to ensure 
overflow is detected.)
