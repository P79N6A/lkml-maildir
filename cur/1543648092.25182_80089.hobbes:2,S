The reason for -fpic for module code lies in the compiler. To improve the
code we use the brasl and larl instructions for function calling and
addressing data. Unluckily these two instructions have a limited range
of +-4GB. For user space programs that means that a single shared object
may not be bigger than 4GB and that no non-fpic code is linked into
shared objects. With these two restrictions we are able to generate
much better code. There is one small problem though: kernel modules.
They get loaded into the vmalloc area which is located AFTER the main
memory. A machine with more than 4 GB of main memory therefore can't
load modules anymore because the calls and references to kernel structure
can't span the distance between vmalloc area and kernel image. To get
around this problem we compile kernel modules with -fpic and make the
modutils create plt stubs and got entries. Easy ?

Because -fpic code likes to relocated absolute addresses.
