Ok, I just committed the "add hidden d_type to the 32-bit getdents" thing, 
and I'd like to have people verify that it works (I just verified that it 
didn't break anything, but hey, nothing is using the data, so..)
However, the more I look at the above, the more confused I get. Your 
explanation simplty doesn't make any sense.
The thing is, it's _trivial_ to convert from the bigger format into the 
smaller format. It would be much harder to convert the other way. What's 
the problem with just using he getdents64 format and converting the data 
in-place?
