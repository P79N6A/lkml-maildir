btw, AFIK the fact dvd player can hang some millisecond across a
close/open cycle, isn't really because of the blkdev in pagecache but
simply because the <2.4.10 buffer cache layer wasn't able to do proper
readahead on the blkdev. Now we do readahead properly and so in turn
the the lack of media-change trust of the vfs shows up. So as far I can
tell the right fix have no influence on the blkdev in pagecache, but it
only consists in resurrecting the media-change detection with a
per-device bitflag whitelist. I cannot see other source of stalls across
a close/open cycle.
