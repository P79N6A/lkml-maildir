Please do not post your driver as a "RAR" attachment,
not only are most Linux folks not familiar with this
archive format, it is also an attachment type rejected
by just about every large email service provider out
there.
gmail.com itself automatically rejects this attachment
type, as I just learned by seeing several hundred bounces
hit vger.kernel.org's postmaster mailbox due to your posting.
