Ok so you just want to turn scatterlist into what I call sg_list in 2.5
time, fine with me too. Depends on whether we want to keep the
pci_map_sg and struct scatterlist interface intact, or just break it and
tell driver authors they must fix their stuff regardless of whether they
want to support highmem. As I write this sentence, it's clear to me
which way is the superior :-)

Yep. Want me to add in the x86 parts of your patch?
