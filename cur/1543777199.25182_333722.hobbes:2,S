    Note that I didn't suggest to backup or have a copy of the MBR,
but of the partition table, the FULL partition table (that includes
the secondary partitions and the like. Once a disk is fully
partitioned, a couple of 'dd' commands do the trick even for
extended partitions.
    It's a mess, anyway :(
