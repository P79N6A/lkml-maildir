It's perfectly safe to _generate_ an IPI from under the runqueue lock. We
do it in a number of cases, and did it for years. What precise hardware
did you run this on?

firstly, the IPI is not sent to all processors, it's sent to a single
target CPU. Secondly, where and why would the hang happen?
we do loop in one place in the x86 APIC code, apic_wait_icr_idle(). I
believe this should never loop indefinitely, unless the hw is broken.

i dont disagree in theory with offloading the SMP-message sending outside
the critical section (it makes things more parallel, and the APIC message
itself goes asynchronously anyway), but i'd like to understand the precise
reason for the hang first. The current code should not hang.
