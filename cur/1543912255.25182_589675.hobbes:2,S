Sorry for not catching this one sooner, but AFAICT, Fedora didn't ship a glibc
that trips over this (2.6.90-12) until Saturday and I installed it yesterday.
-22-rc6-mm1 demonstrated the same issue as well.
The issue:  vdso and gettimeofday seem to be having a quarrel.
At boot, the system clock is just fine.   Right when it hits the 5-minute
uptime mark (and suspiciously close to the jiffie rollover), the date suddenly
shoots forward 4096 seconds.
Dumb test script:
#!/bin/bash
log="uptime.`uname -r`"
touch /root/$log
tail -f /root/$log &
while /bin/true;
do
        uptime >> /root/$log
        date >> /root/$log
        sleep 1
done

uptime keeps reporting the right time, date goes flying ahead.  Once we
get into this state, I can issue a 'date' command to set the *right* time,
and then it will immediately reset back.  Doing a 'touch foo; ls -l foo'
shows the correct time.
Booting with vdso=0 makes the time/date run normally.
Ideas?
