Okay, maybe not. Some combination of the debug options you enabled causes this 
problem, but DEBUG_STACK_POISON itself is not the cause. Today I compiled Yet 
Another (tm) CONFIG_4KSTACKS kernel with DEBUG_STACK_POISON, 
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW and CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE, which worked fine (from 
a random reboot perspective).
I've also upgraded GCC to 4.0.1 as Jakub highlighted elsewhere in this thread 
that it had been released.
Here's a screenshot of the oops. Notice that "stack left" is now -52. We've 
confirmed this is a stack overflow!

I'm going to try the 8K stack kernel with the same stuff and see if I can get 
a stack trace. I hope this is the beginning of the end for this problem.
