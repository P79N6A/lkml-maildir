Subject: [PATCH 00/10] REVIEW: Xen patches for 2.6.24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is my current set of updates to Xen for 2.6.24.  This is largely
a bugfix set, and a couple of them are also relevent to 2.6.23.
These are in the pre-x86 merge form; I'll update them once the merge
goes into git.
Quick overview:
 - remove some dead code in arch/i386/mm/init.c
 - clean up some duplicate includes
 - when sending an IPI, yield the vcpu if the destination doesn't have
   a real cpu to run on
 - fix a bug where a lazy cr3 reload can prevent a pagetable from being
   unpinned
 - deal with split pte locks properly
 - fix an old structure used for the register_vcpu_info hypercall
 - add some multicall debugging help
 - workaround for a bad XFS/Xen interaction
Thanks,
	J
