Hi,
The struct i2c_adapter in 2.4 has following elements which are no longer
used in kernel 2.6:
void (*inc_use)(struct i2c_adapter *);
void (*dec_use)(struct i2c_adapter *);
We used MOD_INC_USE_COUNT for inc_use and MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT. Can anyone
confirm that is no longer required in kernel 2.6?
Thank you.
Jim
