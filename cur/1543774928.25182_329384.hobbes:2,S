According to the user, it is tested and it is running flawlessly for
2 weeks now.

It's my fault. The driver (skystar2) which has been replaced by the 
flexcop-driver was so complicated to read, because of an IMHO abuse of 
bitmask and bit-shifting. I absolutely wanted to bring more readability to 
that driver without having the endian-issue in mind (rewrite was possible 
after the vendor released the data sheets). Sorry for that.

Patrick.
