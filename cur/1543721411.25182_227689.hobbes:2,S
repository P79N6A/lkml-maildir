Looks much better ... but I'd still dispute whether we need to throw 
non-vfork threads cross node by default. I'd suggest that's disabled
by default, and is either enabled by a global userspace option, or a
per-process one (or the option of both). Most thing (except benchmarks)
simply don't want this in real life ...
