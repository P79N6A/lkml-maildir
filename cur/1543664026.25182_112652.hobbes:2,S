Hi,
I am looking for a way to find out which processes contribute the most 
to disk I/O (something like top, but for disk activity). There seems to 
be no way of doing this (sar, iostat and lsof are no good here), so I 
was wondering whether kernel provides this information at all.
I hope this is not considered offtopic - I don't know of any other forum 
pertinent to the question.
Thank you in advance for any pointers,
Simon
