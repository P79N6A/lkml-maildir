Right.  It's definitely broken in that regard.  I sent it out in this
condition so the patch was small, easy to review, and my approach would
be easy to see.

Yes, the SIGBUS issues are "fixed".  Now the application is killed
directly via VM_FAULT_OOM so it is not possible to handle the fault from
userspace.  For my libhugetlbfs-based fallback approach, I needed to
patch the kernel so that SIGBUS was delivered to the process like in the
days of old.
