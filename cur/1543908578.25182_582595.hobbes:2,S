A hang a short-but-variable period after a clocksource was installed: probably
means that the kernel wedged on the first clock interrupt.
I'd expect 2.6.22 to work OK.  It's a little unexpected that the bug was added
after 2.6.22: a number of these reports have narrowed down to the patchset which
added dynticks and clockevents, but that was already in 2.6.22.
It'd be great if you could run a git bisection search please.
