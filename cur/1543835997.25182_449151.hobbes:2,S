Never ever do that. Never use the data from a hardware RNG
directly. There is intentionally no interface to do so.
If you need random data in some driver, use the functions
in random.h to get random data.
The dataflow is as follows:
HW-RNG -> userspace RNGD (through /dev/hwrng) -> the daemon
checks it for sanity and puts it back into the kernel through
/dev/random -> Your driver gets the data from the /dev/random
entropy pools.
This is very neccesary, because your HW-RNG may fail and
so you may unintentionally use non-random data, if you use
the random data from the RNG directly.
The data _must_ go through userspace rngd, which does FIPS
sanity checks on the data.

I second Alan's answer here. ;)
