Horst von Brand,
I am currently building a 4 processor xeon system, each processor
containing 2 megs of L2 cache. I am going to use this for pseudo
realtime image processing. I spent a lot of money for the 2 meg caches
in the hopes that it would keep the main memory from becoming the system
bottleneck.
If the processes are allowed to rotate, I anticipate that each cache
will have to be refreshed. 2 megabytes of data swapped 4 times seems
like a lot of overhead to me. What am I missing?
I hope to have the machine up in a week. If anybody wants to perform
affinity experiments I would be happy to make them an account. Currently
I am still waiting for my heatsinks and memory:-(
thanks
don
