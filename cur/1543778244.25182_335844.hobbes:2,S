> Andrew has no objection against connector and it lives in -mm
A patch sitting in -mm has zero significance.  A lot of junk
and useless things end up there as often Andrew incorporates
just about every single patch he sees posted to linux-kernel
unless he personally knows of some reason why the change might
be wrong.
So "it's in -mm" is not a metric to use.

People like James Morris had very specific objections about it.
You are a control freak and in general very very difficult to work
with, so nobody wants to help you fix things up.
