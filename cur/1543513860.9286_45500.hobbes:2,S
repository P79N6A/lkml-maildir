    The binfmt_aout patch I sent to Alan was a one liner (see l-k) for an
    obvious bug and it had nothing to do with the binfmt_aout stuff that is
    been merged into 2.2.13.
    The patch I produced starting from the 2.3.x code - and that is been
    merged in 2.2.13 - instead has a very good object that is to allow the old
    binaries to run even on filesystems with a blocksize > 1k.
Yes.
I sent my patch mainly so that you could see what was wrong in 2.2.13
and make sure that similar bugs in 2.3.*, if any, were fixed.
The main bug in 2.2.13, failure to allocate bss for libraries,
does not occur in 2.3.*: I see
	do_mmap(..., ex.a_text + ex.a_data + ex.a_bss, ...)
in do_load_aout_library().
And indeed, I can run 2.3.21 without getting segfaults.

    I backported the messages from 2.3.x and I think the point of the messages
    is exactly to remind to to the binary only people to produced ELF
    binaries.
Yes, but please, change things from
	if (jiffies - lasttime > HZ/100) {
		printk("You are using ancient stuff, you fool!\n");
		lasttime = jiffies;
	}
into
	static int count=0;
	if (count++ < 3)
		printk("You still have a genuine ZMAGIC binary!\n");
Really - it is stupid to get warnings all the time.
One has to go in and edit the kernel source just to avoid them.
A few at boot time is enough. It is not an error to use old stuff,
and in some cases it is unavoidable. Part of a stable system is
that it doesnt break old stuff, at least not without very good reason.

[And apart from the above reasons, somehow it violates my
sense of esthetics to see jiffies used in such a context.
Running a binary has nothing to do with the time-of-day.
There should be no reference to jiffies in binfmt_aout.c.]
