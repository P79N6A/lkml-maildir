Well you're just forcing the user to press power/reset/sysrq-b which
will pretty much guarantee data loss if anything is unwritten.

I think it should call sync(), but have a suitable timeout.
Never spend more than 10 seconds on the sync. And give user visible 
feedback during the countdown.
Now of course fixing the complete IO stack to support timeouts
might be too hard (although in theory they're already supposed
to have them, but as we know that doesn't always work reliable)
One alternative would be to do it with a background thread
(which seems to be en vogue right now anyways)
Ok I suppose with that Nick's lock is actually ok, although
I still don't like it very much.
