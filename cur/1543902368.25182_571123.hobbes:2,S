Interesting.  The "right" way to do this seems to be to put both "classic"
and "realtime" RCU into the kernel.  The "classic" RCU would be there
to support synchronize_sched() without calling getaffinity(), while
the "realtime" RCU would be there for the standard RCU API.
I will work this into my -mm efforts.
