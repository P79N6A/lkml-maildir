There were some patches floating around to do exactly this (don't
remember where, sorry ;-) )
There's also an esr_disable flag variable I put in a while back
when doing bringup of NUMA-Q to smack the ESR into submission. 
You might want to try tweaking that on in smp.h. It's not like we
actually do anything with the errors anyway. (all assuming my
mind isn't faulty, and this is actually the same thing). The read / 
write protocol for ESR is really .... wierd, and it seems to need
smacking multiple times to accept a write.
