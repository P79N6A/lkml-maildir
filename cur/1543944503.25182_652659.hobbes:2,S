The bigger risk, in my view, is breaking some piece of existing user code.
Properly written user code wouldn't break, but that doesn't mean much.
Changes, even minor corner case changes, often break something, so should
not be done with out cause.  Whether or not code cleanup in mempolicy.c is
sufficient cause here is not clear to me.
Future room for growth doesn't mean so much for me here; if we close one
future alternative, we always have others, such as more mode flag bits.
