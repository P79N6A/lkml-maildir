greetings!
the lockup of test12 leaves no droppings i can find, but in the 
course of a half-dozen lockups in the last few days i've made an 
observation or two that may be of diagnostic help.
system is a k6-2 on a via chipset mb with onboard everything but 
video (fic va-503a). kernel built with gcc-2.95.2. glibc is 2.2.
the lockups occur during mouse movement -- mouse is kensington 
emulating microsoft. the peculiar thing is that the mouse 
acceleration seems to slow a little in the seconds before the lockup. 
i don't know that this is a useful datum, but it seemed as if it 
might be significant.
the lockups are otherwise neither predictable or reproducible.
