Here's part of the reason why.  The below is from update_cpu_clock()
when now <= last.  I print now, last_tick, timestamp, and a total
timewarp count.  This is a UP kernel, CPU is 3GHz P4 running flat out,
no clockmod (though it is compiled in).

Most happen at boot, but they continue to happen occasionally.  Even
tossing these in the bit bucket, I've given up on timeslice accuracy,
because the numbers just don't add up right.  This and the pm timer
thing make sched_clock() fairly annoying.
