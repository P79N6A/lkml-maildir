Hi all,
  I'm having problems getting Intel ICH audio driver working
properly. It plays MP3's like 1.5-2x faster than normal.
lspci -n:
00:1f.5 Class 0401: 8086:2445 (rev 01)
It's an AC97-compatible embedded soundchip
(SoundMAX audio) in a Compaq Deskpro EN .. intel i810 chipset.
In 2.4-test10-pre4:
kernel: Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.01, 16:08:46 
kernel: PCI: Setting latency timer of device 00:1f.5 to 64
kernel: i810: Intel ICH2 found at IO 0x2400 and 0x2000, IRQ 5
In 2.2.18pre16:
kernel: Intel 810 + AC97 Audio, version 0.17, 10:02:29 Oct 18 2000
kernel: PCI: Increasing latency timer of device 00:fd to 64
kernel: i810: Intel ICH2 found at IO 0x2400 and 0x2000, IRQ 5
kernel: ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, vendor id1: 0x4144, id2: 0x5360
(Analog Devices AD1885)
kernel: i810_audio: Found 1 audio device(s).
In 2.4, sound doesn't even play.
In 2.2.18pre16, sound plays quite fast (1.5x-2x faster).
Is there a tweak for this?
Please direct all replies to my e-mail address
(freyason@yahoo.com), as I am not actually subscribed to the
linux-kernel list. 
Thanks!
Tom
