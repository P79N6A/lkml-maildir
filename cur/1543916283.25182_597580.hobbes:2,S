Neil is just not coping well with jet-lag....
Patch #3 looks good and necessary
  Acked-By: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.de>
I know that should probably be a "reviewed-by"....  I was a bit
surprised that the "handle_completed_read_requests" call was so early
in handle_stripe5 - I don't think the code was originally that early.
But it is probably right.   Hopefully my brain will have cleared by
Monday and I'll review it again then.
