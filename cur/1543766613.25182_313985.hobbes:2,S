  For example a network server app has an open connection on which it
uses async IO to submit two buffers for a read operation. Both buffers
are pinned using get_user_pages() and the connection waits for data to
arrive. The connection received data, it is written into the first buffer,
the app is notified using async IO, and it retreives the async IO
completion. The app reads the buffer which happens to contain a command
to spawn a child, the app forks a child. Now there is still a buffer
posted for read and if more data arrives on the connection that data is
copied to the pages which were saved when the buffer was pinned. The app
is notified, retrieves the async IO completion, but when it goes to read
that buffer it will not have the new data.

  The kernel module which pinned the memory is responsible for unpinning
it if the file descriptor, which was used to deliver the command that
resulted in the pinning, is closed.
