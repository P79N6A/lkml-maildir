Unless the drives are battery backed up as well, I'm not sure that this
is a good thing, or at least a safe thing. And if a write error happens
after the controller tells you the sync() is done? That's a question,
not a comment, I'm not sure Linux software RAID would relocate if the
drive was out of spare sectors, either, but it at least could.
I don't question your statement that caching helps performance, but I
think there is some loss of reliability. I have no numbers to estimate
the effect, so take it as a comment only.
