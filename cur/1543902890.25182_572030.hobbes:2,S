I'm getting this with current GIT kernels when I plug an SD card into
the side of my machine.  It appears to see the filesystem OK anyway, but
for some reason all the hal/gnome desktop stuff isn't seeing it.  Was
working last week.
The message is:
mmc0: Unexpected interrupt 0x00008000.

The machine is a Thinkpad X60, and the SD device is:
15:00.2 Generic system peripheral [0805]: Ricoh Co Ltd R5C822 SD/SDIO/MMC/MS/MSPro Host Adapter (rev 18)
        Subsystem: Lenovo Thinkpad X60s
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 22
        Memory at e4301800 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
        Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 2
Seems to work OK if I manually mount it.  To be honest, I don't know if
this message was always appearing or not; I only checked because it
didn't seem to be working.
