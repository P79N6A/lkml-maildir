Pushed to linux-omap. I guess you're planning to send the missing
Kconfig + Makefile patch for this?
Also, it would be better to use omap_mcbsp_xmit_word() or
omap_mcsbsp_spi_master_xmit_word_poll() instead of OMAP_MCBSP_WRITE as
it does not do any checking that it worked. The aic23 and tsc2101
audio in linux-omap tree in general has the same problem.
Regards,
Tony
