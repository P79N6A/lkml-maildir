I have a few questions about all the network isolation stuff:
   * What level of isolation is wanted for the network ? network devices 
? IPv4/IPv6 ? TCP/UDP ?
   * How is handled the incoming packets from the network ? I mean what 
will be mecanism to dispatch the packet to the right virtual device ?
   * How to handle the SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option ?
   * Has the virtual device a different MAC address ? How to manage it 
with the real MAC address on the system ? How to manage ARP, ICMP, 
multicasting and IP ?
It seems for me, IMHO that will require a lot of translation and 
browsing table. It will probably add a very significant overhead.
    * How to handle NFS access mounted outside of the container ?
    * How to handle ICMP_REDIRECT ?
