This looks like the tty locking changes from Alan Cox.
The tty_io.c do_tty_hangup() no longer switches
the line discipline back to N_TTY, so ppp_async.c
is not aware of the hangup (ldisc->close not called).
The following is a snippet from tty_io.c:
	/* Defer ldisc switch */
	/* tty_deferred_ldisc_switch(N_TTY);
	
	  This should get done automatically when the port closes and
	  tty_release is called */
I'll setup a test connection and verify this.
