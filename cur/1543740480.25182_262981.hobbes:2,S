but initrd needs a FS code linked in :)
the only way to have no fs linked in the kernel, is to use initramfs,
i.e. rootfs as the real root.
The solution to the problem is to provide the basics of a system in
the newc cpio format (see in Documentation/early-userspace/) which
will require no FS code linked in (huh, I guess RAMFS is needed ;)),
tweak usr/Makefile to get it use the in-place initramfs_data.cpio.gz and
put the cpio archive in usr. (I do this way because the initramfs_list
"mechanics" never succeeded in getting me a working kernel :))
