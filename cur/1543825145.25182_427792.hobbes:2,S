Often they flat-out don't work.  Walk into a store and buy a random
laptop.  Odds are it uses an Intel graphics chip.  Now load intelfb on
this.  Watch it completely fail to set a mode, as intelfb has no
knowledge beyond what the CRTC was like on i810.
The support offered by fbdev drivers is laughable in comparison to the
support offered by X drivers.  If you're lucky, it fails cleanly.  If
not, you're silently failing to get a working display.
