I see a large delay _before_:
Calibrating delay using timer specific routine.. (lpj==
The lpj value is 38x the host lpj host value.  Booting with lpj="some 
random number" removes the stall for me.  And finally, breaking into 
kernel in this stall period consistently shows EIPs in calibrate_delay 
in backtrace.

The NET: pause has always been there, I think it just becomes much more 
noticeable if the lpj value is 38x normal.
Conclusion: you are getting bad lpj computation during beginning.  
Doesn't appear to be a kernel bug, so let's take it off list.  You can 
bring it up on VMTN 
http://www.vmware.com/community/index.jspa?categoryID=1
 for more 
on-topic support.  In fact, interesting test you can try - suspend / 
resume during the hang.  Does the discontinuity during calibration make 
it go away?
