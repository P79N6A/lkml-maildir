Hi! I aplied you patch to kernel-2.4.10 and tried to compile it.But during
compiling got error,which was caused by double definition of sort. It is
already in scsi/u14-34f.c,function with 4 parameters,declared as static.
As your #define sort is used only in fs.h,so I renamed it by adding some
symbols to name for ex. _sort,or hihahasort,(that is joke :)
Cheers,YP
