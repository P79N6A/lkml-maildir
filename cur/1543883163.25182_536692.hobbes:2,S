I hope that means your devices have full source code available under
the GPL. Even if they do, kcli will probably encourage other folks to
abuse the kernel license.

Probably no worse than whatever I/O interface you're likely to use
with this. Reminds me of a particular "world-famous filesystem
developer" who eventually figured out that his serial console was the
cause of most of the filesystem latency glitches he was hitting.

Please familiarize yourself with initramfs and klibc. You can attach
an arbitrary minimal filesystem to the kernel image. You don't need a
special compiler, flash, etc., and the kernel build system will build
the filesystem image (a cpio archive) for you.

Moving stuff to userspace usually has negative overhead because it's
pageable, easier to maintain, and easier to debug.

I once spent a few weeks getting OpenSSH serving multiple clients on
vxWorks and I'm happy I'll never have to touch a kernel without
userspace again.
I think there probably is a place for some basic debugging and
introspection, including dumping address ranges, looking up symbols
and the like, but a debugger is different than a command interpreter.
