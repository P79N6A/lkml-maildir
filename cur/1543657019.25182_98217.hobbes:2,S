Hi Richard,
	This is pretty obscure, but I thought I should mention this
bug to you.
	I think there is a module unload race for character devices in
devfs whereby devfs retains a file_operations pointer that is no longer
valid after a character device driver module has been unloaded.
	I was able to trip the problem by adding a 10 second
sleep near the beginning of dentry_open (in fs/open.c) whenever a
parallel port was opened.  Then I was able to produce a kernel paging
error by doing the following:
modprobe parport_pc
modprobe lp
cat /dev/printers/0 &
rmmod lp
	Ten seconds later, I'd get a bad pointer reference on the
address previously occupied by lp_fops.  dentry_open would call
devfs_open; devfs_open would try to read lp_fops presumably because
some pointer to it had not been cleared.
	The problem does not occur without devfs because the regular
chrdev_open calls get_chrfops which fetches the appropriate takes a
semaphore that is used by {,un}register_chrdev, and, with that
semaphore held, fetches the appropriate f_ops and increments the
module's reference count before releasing the semaphore.  I had
previously thought that this was a more general problem, but now I now
think it's limited to devfs, so I thought I ought to let you know.
