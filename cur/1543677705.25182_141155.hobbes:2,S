Subject: [PATCH] disentangle printk's whilst oopsing on SMP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
The attached patch stops printk's issued on different processors from becoming
char-by-char interleaved whilst one of them is oopsing.
