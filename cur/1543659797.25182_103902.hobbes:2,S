Hello list,
I recently switched my debian install over from 2.4.19 to 2.4.20. Since then 
I've been having trouble syncing my Palm m500 over Irda. It works, but the 
transfers seem to stall a lot, making the total hotsync take over 5 minutes 
to complete.
The irda transfers work fine in 2.4.19.
These are the messages in the dmesg:
ircomm_tty_attach_cable()
ircomm_tty_ias_register()
irlap_state_ndm(), media busy!
irlap_change_speed(), setting speed to 115200
irlmp_state_dtr(), Unknown event LM_LAP_CONNECT_CONFIRM
ircomm_param_service_type(), services in common=04
ircomm_param_service_type(), resulting service type=0x04
ircomm_param_xon_xoff(), XON/XOFF = 0x11,0x13
ircomm_param_enq_ack(), ENQ/ACK = 0x13,0x11
ircomm_tty_check_modem_status()
ircomm_param_xon_xoff(), XON/XOFF = 0x11,0x13
ircomm_param_enq_ack(), ENQ/ACK = 0x13,0x11
ircomm_tty_check_modem_status()
irlmp_state_dtr(), Unknown event LM_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT
Framing or parity error!
Framing or parity error!
Framing or parity error!
... lots of framing errors
<here the transfer stalls and JPilot hangs>
after half a minute the transfer continues, only to stall later again.
I'm using the following irda related modules:
irtty irport ircomm-tty ircomm irda
Any ideas?
Thanks!
DK
