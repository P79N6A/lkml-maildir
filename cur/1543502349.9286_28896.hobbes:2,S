I'm actually trying to get people to move away from the legacy support.
The reason I made request_region() return the region it got is that I
personally want drivers to move into doing things like
	resource = request_region(a,b,"driver");
	...
	release_resource(resource);
instead of using "release_region()".
The reason? "release_region()" is a fundamentally broken interface, and
cannot handle the nested resources etc, and doesn't have the nice
sanity-checks that a release_resource() thing can have (ie validating that
it gets passed the same pointer that it got allocated etc).

I want the "flags" field to be completely anonymous, ie usable for the
thing that uses the resource. The allocator and de-allocator should not
look at them.
The "flags" stuff is for things like MTRR etc, where each region can have
it's own attributes (cachable, write-combine, etc etc). And region
attributes depend on what kind of region it is, which is why I don't want
to have the generic resource code really know about it.
release_region() should probably just unconditionally kfree() the area -
it's only legal to do a release_region() on something that did a
request_region() anyway, so the unconditional kfree() is always correct.

I'd prefer to rename it, so that people don't by mistake think that it
does a "real" request_region(). But other than that I don't think it is
gross - although I wonder if vgacon.c shouldn't just be using the native
stuff directly, the way I made the architecture setup files do it.
(The setup.c code actually got a lot _cleaner_ by using the new native
primitives - it's not as if they are ugly or anything)
