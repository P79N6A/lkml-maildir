Interesting
At the time I submitted it there was a big discussion on just how messed up the documentation
directory was, inconsistent and not well laid out. Then more discussion on how it could be laid
out in relation to where various subsystem were laid out (ie drivers doc directory like there was
a drivers src directory and the like).
Therefore I placed it following that pattern.
So what I am hearing is that documentation for a subsystem should just continue to be dumped into
one directory with everything else.
Okay, if that is the goal, I am fine with, but things are pretty jumbled up in there. I will know
where it is at least.
