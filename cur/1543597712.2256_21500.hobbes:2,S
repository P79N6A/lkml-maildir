Good.  I don't want a clueless it manager administrating a linux box
anyway.
Of course the same applies to NT.  Try creating a unprivileged account
named "administrator" with full access to a faked control panel.  Or
for something a little easier - a fake program named "format" 
or "deltree" that writes the same on screen as the real thing.  
And makes the disk click by seeking. :-)
Any os is sooo easy to simulate a break in.

Don't work for a manager that clueless - or tell him it's a hoax.
