Yes, that is how NT stores are defined.

We do this already, but in most cases it doesn't matter anyways. We AFAIK
do not rely on any ordering for copy_*_user for example. There are not
that many users of nt so it's not a huge issue.

You mean sfence? lfence in rmb is definitely needed.
sfence on x86-64 is not strictly needed, but also shouldn't hurt very much 
so I always kept it in.
