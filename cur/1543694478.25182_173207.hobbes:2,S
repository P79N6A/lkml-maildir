Well, this behaviour makes sense.
"If we can't read this, leave it in place, perhaps we can read it in
future (when temperature drops below 80Celsius or something)". "If we
can't write this, bad, but we can reallocate without loosing
anything".
It looks slightly unexpected, but pretty sane to me. Anything else
would kill your data.
