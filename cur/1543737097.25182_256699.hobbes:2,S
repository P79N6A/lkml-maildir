Not all parts of power management integrate well yet with each other,
though it's acting better.  Plus there are some OHCI updates in the USB
patches (you'll have those in the MM tree) that help address some of
the more perverse ways that suspend-to-disk kicks USB around, and
a few similar usbcore changes that need re-integration with the RC3
swsusp/pmdisk updates.
Keep using the "rmmod" workaround for now.  And don't combine
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND with suspend-to-{disk,ram} unless you're
feeling like debugging the results.
