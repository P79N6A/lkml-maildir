This is the linux thread spinlock acquire :
static void __pthread_acquire(int * spinlock)
{
  int cnt = 0;
  struct timespec tm;
  while (testandset(spinlock)) {
    if (cnt < MAX_SPIN_COUNT) {
      sched_yield();
      cnt++;
    } else {
      tm.tv_sec = 0;
      tm.tv_nsec = SPIN_SLEEP_DURATION;
      nanosleep(&tm, NULL);
      cnt = 0;
    }
  }
}
Yes, it calls sched_yield() but this is not a std wait for mutex but for
spinlocks that are hold a very short time.
Real wait are implemented using signals.
More, with the new implementation of sys_sched_yield() the task release all its
time quantum so, even in a case where a task repeatedly calls sched_yield() the
call rate is not so high if there is at least one process to spin.
And if there isn't one task with goodness() > 0, nobody cares about
sched_yield() performance.
