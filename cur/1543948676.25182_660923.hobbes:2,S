thanks for tracking this down. It would be nice to figure out why this 
change made a difference. Perhaps VM86 mode has some restrictions in 
what type of pagetables it can operate in - and the CPU just refuses to 
properly emulate those 16-bit instructions? (this would be very weird). 
We are trying to execute 16-bit BIOS code here, right?
which instruction is the segfault coming from - the int $0x80? So in 
vm86 mode we generated a #GPF which shows up as a SIGSEGV?
