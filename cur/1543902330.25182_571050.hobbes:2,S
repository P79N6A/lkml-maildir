The main use for the SLIT information are the zone fallback lists in 
the VM. These are created at boot.  If you change the SLIT later these
won't be regenerated. 
The scheduler also uses it for load balancing, but it is much less
important there than in the VM.
The only use would be for libnuma applications that read the SLIT later,
but I'm not aware of any.
Don't think that is really useful.
If anything you would probably need a early boot option for this, but that
would become so ugly that I would rather ask for fixing the BIOSes.
Or implement true node hotplug, but that would be also a lot of work.
On 4S it should not make that much difference anyways and 8S is hopefully
ok.
