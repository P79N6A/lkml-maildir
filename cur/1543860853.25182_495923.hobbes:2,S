Hi,
I would like to set up a directory with only links to the source files
I use during the building of the kernel. The development ide/editor
will target this directory instead of main source tree. The benefit of this
is that I don't need to bother about files that are not included
by the configuration.
Can I do this by something like....
make linked_directory
If not, what part of make is a good starting point?
