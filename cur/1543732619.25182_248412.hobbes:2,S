  That I do not really know. But I think this is somewhat the
  discussion here - how to make the support for metas and streams
  as good as possible.
  I suppose it would be difficult to actually query the user about
  something like this unless the applications themselves do. Perhaps
  warnings in the syslog is good for now?
  Already  now  things  like advanced attributes get lost when copying
  data from a supported fs to a non-supported one.
  Perhaps documentation around the ways to use streams and meta data
  should mention that only the supported fs will keep the extra info.
  As long as the user is aware that whatever information he puts in
  the meta or streams will be lost then it is ok, isn't it?
