That's easy.  Look at the connector end (top up) to the left.  Cardbus cards
and pcmcia cards differ at that spot.  This is the best I can do in ascii:
 +----  top
++
|    connector
+----- bottom
^ this part is thick on cardbus.
 +----  top
 |
++
+----- bottom
^ this part is thin on pcmcia.  This is so that cardbus cards won't fit into
a system that doesn't support cardbus.  (This is what I assumed, but I don't
believe all manufacturers made the slots that way)
