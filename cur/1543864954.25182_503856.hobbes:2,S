The wakeup in barrier_sync() would mean that the counter was zero
at some point in the past.  The counter would then be rechecked, and
if it were still zero, barrier_sync() would invoke finish_wait() and
then return -- but the counter might well become non-zero in the
meantime, right?
So given that barrier_sync() is permitted to return after the counter
becomes non-zero, why can't it just rely on the fact that barrier_unlock()
saw it as zero not long in the past?

OK -- but barrier_sync() just waits for readers, it doesn't exclude them.
If all barrier_sync() needs to do is to wait until all pre-existing
barrier_lock()/barrier_unlock() pairs to complete, it seems to me to
be compatible with qrcu's semantics.
So what am I missing here?
