I suspect that spreading evenly over the current tasks mems_allowed is
just what is needed.
There is nothing special about big Altix systems here; just use
task->mems_allowed.  For all but tasks using MPOL_BIND, this means
spreading the caching over the nodes in the tasks cpuset.
We don't want to spread over a larger area, because cpusets need to
maintain a fairly aggressive containment.  One jobs big data set must
not pollute the cpuset of another job, except in cases involving kernel
distress.
