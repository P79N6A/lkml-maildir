I see.
My use for namespaces is to simply customize the fs view on login, so
sys_unshare is more convenient than clone because it now allows a pam
library to switch namespaces, which was either impossible or hard to do
using clone.  Making namespaces first-class objects should also work,
since the namespaces can just be set up in advance and then entered from
inside a pam library.
Still I'd agree with Eric.  It'd be good to see just how much we can do
with the ability to clone a namespace outside of clone().  Going back to
the daemon handing out namespaces...  why can't you just take your
earlier example of /var/namespaces/NS1, etc, where you just create a
bunch of fs trees under the /var/namespaces directory using bind mounts,
and then login or pam does
	sys_unshare(CLONE_NEWNS);
	chdir(/var/namespaces/NS3)
	pivot_root(/var/namespaces/NS3, tmp)
	umount(tmp, MNT_DETACH)
	chroot .
?
No daemon needed...
thanks,
