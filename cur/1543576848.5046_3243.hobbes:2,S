thttpd is i/o bound, not CPU bound, so there's no need for SMP scaling.
It's an effective little server as long as the active document
tree fits in RAM.  
If it ain't broke, don't tell people how to fix it :-)
(If for some reason SMP scaling was desirable, the thttpd
way to do it would be to introduce one thread for each
CPU, and have each thread run the same select() loop.)
