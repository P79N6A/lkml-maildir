Ok. The web site I am trying to access is
https://webbroker.waterhouse.com
I can access it from many machines/networks. The only problems I
have are 2 networks behind Linux gateway machines. One is a SLIP
connection and the other is a T3 connection. Is there anything
I can do on the Linux gateway machines to make it work? It works
for other routers. It looks like a Linux bug to me.
Thanks.
