No need for an EMC module, I think that we can issue a simple  patch to 
dasd.c that removes the (silly) binary module that was there.
I would prefer that the clean up not break one of the few (and 
relatively common) devices supported by the dasd.c driver. If for no 
other reason, it would seem to make it more likely to be able test the 
existing patch properly.
