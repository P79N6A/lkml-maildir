Subject: [PATCH 1/2] [RFC] PCI: read revision ID by default
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/8/550

Currently there are 97 occurrences where drivers need the pci
revision ID. We can do this once for all devices. Even the pci
subsystem needs the revision several times for quirks. The extra
u8 member pads out nicely in the pci_dev struct.
