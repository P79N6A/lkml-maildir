Data that is shared by applications or by the kernel. The user space 
programs may allocate shared data with interleave policy. For certain data 
the kernel may use interleave allocations. F.e. page cache pages in a 
cpuset configured for memory spreading.
It depends what the application or the kernel designates to be shared 
data.

Hotspots create lots of requests going to the same numa node. The nodes 
have a limited capability to service cacheline requests and the bandwidth 
on the interlink is also limited. If too many processors request 
information from the same remote node then performance will drop.
There are different kind of data in a NUMA system:
Data that is node local is only accessed by the local processor. For node 
local data we have no such concerns since the interlink is not used. Quite 
a lot of kernel data per node or per cpu and thus is not a problem.
For shared data that is known to be performance critical--and where we 
know that the data is accessed from multiple nodes--there we need to 
balance the data between multiple nodes to avoid overloads and 
to keep the system running at optimal speed. That is where interleave 
becomes important.
