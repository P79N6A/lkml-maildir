What a shame that other operating systems can manage to really support 
O_DIRECT, and that major application software can use this api to write 
portable code that works even on Windows.
You overlooked the problem that applications using this api assume that 
reads are on bare metal as well, how do you address the case where 
thread A does a write, thread B does a read? If you give thread B data 
from a buffer and it then does a write to another file (which completes 
before the write from thread A), and then the system crashes, you have 
just put the files out of sync. So you may have to block all i/o for all 
threads of the application to be sure that doesn't happen. Or introduce 
some complex way to assure that all writes are physically done in 
order... that sounds like a lock infested mess to me, assuming that you 
could ever do it right.
Oracle has their own version of Linux now, do you think that they would 
fork the application or the kernel?
