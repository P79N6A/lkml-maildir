Are you using 'tleds', or some other program that flashes the keyboard
LEDs?
I was using the abovementioned program, which flashes the keyboard LEDs in
response to network activity, and I had the same problem.  It disappeared
when I disabled the program.
Whether this is a bug in tleds or a general issue with frobbing the keyboard
LEDs, I don't know, though.
