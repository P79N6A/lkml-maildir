For most values of 'scanned over', but not all. There are lots of ways of
looking for something that will prime the dcache..

..which may be zero in the above case if the dentries are all backed by
dirs in the page cache you mentioned. Or one in the case of dentries found
by visiting neighboring files. It's very hard to guess at what that number
is for any discardable VM object because it's entirely dependent on what
else is in cache and what order the data's accessed.
I'm sure that there is some merit to valuing some caches more highly than
other but there are obviously other issues to sort out before we can begin
weighing them against each other.
