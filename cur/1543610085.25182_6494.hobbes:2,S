I am getting this message  "can't open /dev/video0: No such device" in
2.4.14 and I am completely baffeled at this time!
1) /dev/video0 exists   ls -l shows  "crw-rw-rw-    1   root root
81,   0 Nov 17 15:05 /dev/video0"
2) ls /proc/cpia/video0 exists and show lots of info (email me if you
want it)
3) ls /proc/video/dev/video0 also exists and shows:
name            : CPiA Camera
type            : VID_TYPE_CAPTURE
hardware        : 0x18
4) When I start xawtv it gives the message "can't open /dev/video0: No
such device"
lastly it works under redhat's default kernel 2.4.7 and it seems that
the video driver 2.4.14 is 0.74 but the one in redhats kernel is > 1.0
I'm going to try getting the latest driver from their site and see if
that works, anyone else experiencing this or know anything about this?
