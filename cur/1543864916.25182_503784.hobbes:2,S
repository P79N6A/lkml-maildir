Excellent!  But tell me,
+	atomic_inc(&dp->pde_users);
+	if (!dp->proc_fops)
don't you need a memory barrier between these two?  Also a corresponding
one where proc_fops is set to NULL.
+		/*

+		 * allocating ->proc_fops, save a pointer somewhere.
+		 */
+		de->proc_fops = NULL;
+		/* Wait until all readers/writers are done. */
+		if (atomic_read(&de->pde_users) > 0) {
+			spin_unlock(&proc_subdir_lock);
+			msleep(1);
+			goto again;
+		}
I don't understand how this is supposed to work.  Consider
CPU1					CPU2
atomic_inc(&dp->pde_users);
if (dp->proc_fops)
					de->proc_fops = NULL;
	use_proc_fops <= BOOM
					if (atomic_read(&de->pde_users) > 0) {
what prevents dereference of a NULL proc_fops value?
Best wishes,
Duncan.
