linux/hid.h contains definitions needed for drivers speaking HID
protocol, I don't think we want to put quirks for legacy keyboard
driver there. I'd just move the #ifdef within drivers/char/keyboard.c
for now.
BTW, I don't think that mac button emulation will work well when x86
evdev-based driver gains popularity - it "grabs" the device and so no
event will flow through keyboard driver... We'd need a new solution...
