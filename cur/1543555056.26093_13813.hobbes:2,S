That's not nearly enough, you should also resurrect all the stuff from
2.2.x, I'm wondering how this code disappeared from 2.4.x (actually the size <0
can't happen of course since the caller is trusted and the SIGXFSZ could
probably be moved to the VFS but the largefile is definitely an ext2 business):
	if (iattr->ia_valid & ATTR_SIZE) {
		loff_t size = iattr->ia_size;
		unsigned long limit = current->rlim[RLIMIT_FSIZE].rlim_cur;
		if (size < 0)
			return -EINVAL;
		if (size > ext2_max_sizes[EXT2_BLOCK_SIZE_BITS(inode->i_sb)])
			return -EFBIG;
		if (limit != RLIM_INFINITY && size > limit) {
			send_sig(SIGXFSZ, current, 0);
			return -EFBIG;
		}
		if (size >> 33) {
			struct super_block *sb = inode->i_sb;
			struct ext2_super_block *es = sb->u.ext2_sb.s_es;
			if (!(es->s_feature_ro_compat &
			      cpu_to_le32(EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE))){
				/* If this is the first large file
				 * created, add a flag to the superblock */
				es->s_feature_ro_compat |=
				cpu_to_le32(EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE);
				mark_buffer_dirty(sb->u.ext2_sb.s_sbh, 1);
			}
		}
	}
and btw the large file feature setting seems missing also from write(2) ext2
in 2.4.x, confirm?
