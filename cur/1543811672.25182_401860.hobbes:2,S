<shrug>  It will go away when things are fixed, and only users who are 
testing will even bother with it.
Looking over the module subsystem, it looks like one could use 
module_param_named() to achieve proper namespace separation (C versus 
module opt) -- then you could call it libata_fua -- but for a temporary 
module option it seems like more trouble than its worth.
