Subject: [GIT PATCH] driver core fixes for your 2.6-git tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/21/2

Here are 5 bugfixes against your current kernel git tree.
They fix the following reported problems:
	- klist blowing up on CRIS architecture
	- some block device names showing up incorrectly due to
	  mishandled ! formatting
	- sysfs binary file bugfix
	- debugfs build breakage if it is disable and wimax is enabled.
	- PNP modules not properly being autoloaded due to lowercase
	  issues in file2alias.c
All of these have been in the last -next release, with the majority of
them in the -next releases for the past week.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-core-2.6.git/
The patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
