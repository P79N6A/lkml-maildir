Subject: File descriptors in 2.2, 'fixing' OPEN_MAX

Ok, as far as I can tell, file descriptors in 2.2 (and later 2.1
kernels) is set to 1024 maximum. However, 'include/linux/limits.h' has
OPEN_MAX set to 256. This will break a lot of programs which use this to
define their upper limit for file descriptors, particularly Squid and
some flavors of IRCD.
Shouldn't this value be set to 1024... or maybe these programs should
test NR_OPEN instead?
