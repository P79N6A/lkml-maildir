This seems to be now fixing the different problem of swap-space filling up. 
I'm quite willing to for now assume I've got plenty free.

Moreover though -- what I know about log structure is that generally it 
optimises for write (swapout) and might make read (swapin) worse due to 
fragmentation that wouldn't happen with a regular fs structure.
I guess that cleaner that Alan mentioned might be involved there -- I don't 
know how/what it would be doing.

I am very aware of the costs of seeks (on current magnetic media).
