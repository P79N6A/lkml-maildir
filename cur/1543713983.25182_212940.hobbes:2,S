nothing is perfect anyways ;), if you've an implementation it'd be very
interesting to see a result in the kernel compile with -j with mem=800m,
that should be close to a real life worst case. Then we'll see if the
setup after execve is slowed down measurably, it's hard to tell, but we
know there's a chance since you measure significant slowdown from
pte-highmem on very highmem machines with short lived tasks. btw, note that
if the task isn't short lived, good apps should flood with mmap either (at
least on 64bit ;)
