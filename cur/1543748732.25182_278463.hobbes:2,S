I think there are rt stats for this already added by Robert Olsson.
One thing not mentioned, besides the physically contiguous issue,
is that fact that the locking would need to be changed quite a bit
in order to allow runtime reallocation of the hash table.  The current
code is certainly not ready for it.  It might just work to run the
hash freeing via RCU, but I'm not quite sure.
