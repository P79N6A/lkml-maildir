I agree.
There is a similar problem in the Acenic driver, it brings the
link up and receives broadcast packets as soon as the driver
is loaded.  Mostly this is because the driver inits the chip
and registers the IRQ handler at probe time, whereas nearly
every other driver does this at ->open() time.
