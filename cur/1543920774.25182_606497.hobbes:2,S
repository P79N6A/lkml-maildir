Subject: hwmon/f75375s.c: buggy if()

drivers/hwmon/f75375s.c contains the following code:
<--  snip  -->
...
static ssize_t set_pwm_mode(struct device *dev, struct device_attribute *attr,
                const char *buf, size_t count)
{
...
        if (val != 0 || val != 1 || data->kind == f75373)
                return -EINVAL;
...
<--  snip  -->
I'm not sure what exactly was intended, but it was for sure not intended 
to always return -EINVAL...
Spotted by the Coverity checker.
