Never mind.  I seem to have corrected the problem by cleaning up and 
rebuilding from scratch, i.e.
         make mrproper
         make xconfig
         make dep
         make bzImage
         make modules
         make install
         make modules_install
and all worked fine.  Now if I can only remember what events lead up to 
encountering trouble, I might have something useful to report.
