While I am not opposed to choice, I am opposed to having too finegrained
kernel config options. In your view, every single kernel patch would be
a config option... I much rather have config options for "important" big
changes, not for something this small. Another argument is that this
kind of userspace interface is better off being always there or never;
making this variable serves no-one.
