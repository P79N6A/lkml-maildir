Hi,
I'd like to know if anyone is working on support for the AMD Am79C978 
chip.  It provides 10/100Mbps ethernet support, but more interestingly, 
support for the 1Mbps Home networking standard (over standard phone lines 
in your home).
This chip is an extension of the lance architecture.  Does anyone know if 
someone is working on support for it?
Thanks,
Dave
