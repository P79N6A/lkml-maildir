History. Realistically I'd only worry about pioctls that do take a path,
and assume the others will be handled some other way. In fact:

Generally I think this interface will work. I have a few questions:

If you don't specify a pag it should allocate you one, and for non-priviledged
users this should be the only allowed mode.

I assume:
fs is a text representation of whose filesystem you're doing this for?
("openafs", "arla", etc)
domain is what's typically referred to as an afs cell
I'd also like to see a priviledged "unsetpag()", e.g. I no longer wish to be
in a pag.

Currently it's possible to set a token when you have no pag, and these
become associated with the uid that set them. (The pag number is not the uid;
Instead any process without a pag but with a uid that has tokens associated
with it gets those tokens.) As long as the above don't bind tightly to a pag,
sure.
As to pioctl, will it be able to handle things where path cannot be stat'd
in advance? For instance, the prefetching hint (VIOCPREFETCH), if you
could stat it, it wouldn't be a prefetch. Another concern there would be
dangling mount points (a mount point you still have to a volume that's
been deleted) when calling VIOC_AFS_DELETE_MT_PT or VIOC_AFS_STAT_MT_PT.
As long as this is doable, we will conform.

To the extent we can we'd avoid relying on this (8), but I think we'll need it
for now.

The only other concern is transition for existing sites, and that need not
be done in the kernel. All we ask is the current "afs syscall" number be
left vacant, and sites that care can patch their kernel. Nothing need be
distributed.
