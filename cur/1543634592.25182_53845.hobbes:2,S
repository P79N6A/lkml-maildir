+#ifdef CONFIG_X86_NUMA
+       /* "soft" rdtsc implementation */
+       if(!cpu_has_tsc)
+       {
+               char rdtsc_inst[2] = {0x0f, 0x31}; /*rdtsc opcode*/
+               char* inst_ptr = (char*)regs->eip;
+               if((inst_ptr[0] == rdtsc_inst[0])
+                       &&(inst_ptr[1] == rdtsc_inst[1])){
Any particular reason for puting the opcode in an
array and verify against that instead of just
verifying inst_ptr[i] against the constants?
+                       struct timeval tv;
+                       do_gettimeofday(&tv);
+                       regs->eax = tv.tv_usec;
+                       regs->edx = tv.tv_sec;
Looks like the soft tsc is going to be jumping
rather than runing. It is going to be increasing
at a constat rate most of the time, but will make
a big jump ahead every second. Couldn't the jump
easilly be made a lot smaller by using:
   regs->eax = tv.tv_usec<<2;
Of course this is not completely accurate either,
are we willing to pay the price for a more
accurate version?
+                       regs->eip += 2; /*= size of opcode*/
+                       return;
+               }
+       }
+#endif
