There seems to be a race conditions bug in ext2 in the 2.2 kernel
series.  It seems to be relatively rare in actual practice, but I've
recently found a test case which shows off the problem relatively
easily.  I am investigating, and hopefully we'll find the bug shortly.
In the meantime, if you can let me know what sort of load you have on
your machine, that would be useful.  Thanks!!
