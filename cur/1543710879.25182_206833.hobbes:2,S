Can you check that CONFIG_RXRPC was set to "m" or "y" in .config? It should be
turned on automatically if CONFIG_AFS_FS is turned on - in exactly the same
way that CONFIG_NFS turns on CONFIG_SUNRPC (at least, that's how it's set up
in fs/Kconfig).
If it is turned on, can you check to see whether net/rxrpc/rxrpc.ko was (a)
built and (b) installed?
