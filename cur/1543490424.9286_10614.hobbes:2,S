Since I upgraded to 2.2.3 from 2.2.1 and I try to use cdparanoia to
rip a CD to .wav's I get this in my messages file
Mar 19 22:08:53 dogbert kernel: sr0: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.
Mar 19 22:08:53 dogbert kernel: sr0: CDROM not ready.  Make sure there is a disc in the drive.

I am currently on 2.2.3-ac2 with the SMP fix.  I am using a AHA3940UW 
controller with all SCSI drives.  My CD-R is on the second channel.
cat /proc/scsi/scsi shows me this:
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 06 Lun: 00
  Vendor: YAMAHA   Model: CDR100           Rev: 1.11
