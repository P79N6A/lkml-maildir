Following sets of patches add EFI support to x86_64 architecture.
The patches have been tested against 2.6.21 kernel on Intel platforms
with EFI1.10 and UEFI2.0 firmware. The patch files document
implementation and note issues from testing.
Although the tools below are _not_ needed for building the kernel,
the needed bootloader support and associated tools for x86_64 platforms
with EFI firmware and specifications are listed below.
1. UEFI specification:  
http://www.uefi.org
2. Booting EFI64 enabled kernel requires boot loader support.
Patches to elilo and gnu-efi library with x86_64 support and documentation
have been submitted to respective project maintainers.
	elilo: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/elilo
	gnu-efi library: Nigel Croxon at HP is the current maintainer
3. The tool to convert ELF to PE-COFF image:
	binutils-2.17.50.0.14 supports Intel64 EFI.
	see 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/
4. x86_64 platform with EFI/UEFI firmware.
Greatly appreciate your comments on the patches and feedback 
from testing,
thanks,
Chandramouli Narayanan <mouli@linux.intel.com>
