lrmi makes two mmaps of interest on "/dev/mem":
1) the lowest page, which includes the interrupt vectors and
   the BIOS data area
   the BIOS code it executes does need to write to that BIOS
   data area, so PROT_WRITE is necessary, but more on this...
2) the ROM image from 0xa0000 -> 0x100000, no PROT_WRITE necessary
But the thing about #1, which needs the PROT_WRITE, is that it does
not want anonymous pages for that stuff, it's mapping the real
physical memory at those addresses, and indeed /dev/mem is going to
setup all the damn page tables already regardless of whether
MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE is set, and logically indeed MAP_SHARED is
the thing which should be specified here because this mapping is
not "private" to the application in any sense.
That is, /dev/mem mmap()'s do the remap_pfn_range() for the whole area
being mmap()'d (which is where the VM_RESERVED comes from), and
therefore no COW page faults should ever occur for such areas.  Faults
can occur for protection violations or memory errors, but that's it.
I would even argue that MAP_PRIVATE on things like /dev/mem should be
flagged with at least a kernel log message if not an outright -EINVAL
as well.
