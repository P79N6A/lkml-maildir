Well, that and the knowledge of how to monitor it on the other end, 
which I lack :-).  And does one need a null-modem cable?  I haven't used 
serial cables since USB was introduced.  Is serial monitoring preferred 
over netconsole?
In any case, I've figured out how to get netconsole working, and have 
started monitoring it from my wife's laptop.  I just need to reboot and 
make sure it is working (that I got the UDP addresses right), and then 
wait for a crash.  I won't get to this until this evening, probably.
Mark, I'm going to start CC'ing you, and I'll forward you the previous 
emails.
Thanks, everybody, for responding.
