I second Greg's objection, and share his worries. "No possible
regression" is something extremely hard to evaluate in general.
Besides, the goal of -stable as I remember it is not "no regression"
but rather "only bugfixes", i.e. patches don't go in without a good
reason (default policy = reject), rather than patches are rejected if
they may cause problem (default policy = accept.)
Adding support for new devices, even if it's only adding an ID in a
list, is not always safe. I am not happy about new IDs being considered
as OK for late RCs, I am even less so for -stable.
The sole fact that Adrian felt the need to release a -pre1 for
2.6.16.30 betrays his lack of confidence IMHO. And the size of
ChangeLog-2.6.16.29 speaks for itself.
Given that 2.6.16.y follows the naming convention of -stable and is
released in the official v2.6 directory on ftp.kernel.org, I'd like to
see it follow the same rules we have for "real" -stable trees. Adrian,
if you are going to diverge from the original intent of -stable, this
is your own right, but then please change the name of your tree to
2.6.16-ab or something similar, to clear the confusion.
I will not use 2.6.16.y with its current rules, for sure, and I doubt
any distribution will. Wasn't the whole point of 2.6.16.y to serve as a
common base between several distributions?
Thanks,
