Enough already!  These concerns have been raised already, and found  
to be insufficient.  There are several points:
1)	ndiswrapper is broken already, and works sheerly by luck anyways;  
NT stacks are 12kb, so you're already asking for stack overflows by  
using it.
2)	ndiswrapper encourages use of binary drivers instead of the open- 
source ones that need the testers, so you're only hurting yourselves  
in the long run.
3)	All the in-kernel problems have been fixed, and this makes a lot  
of stuff less fragmentation-prone and more reliable.
Does anybody have any _in_kernel_ bugreports which are unaddressed,  
or maybe something out-of-kernel that is not handled by the above  
points?
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett

There is no way to make Linux robust with unreliable memory  
subsystems, sorry.  It would be like trying to make a human more  
robust with an unreliable O2 supply. Memory just has to work.
