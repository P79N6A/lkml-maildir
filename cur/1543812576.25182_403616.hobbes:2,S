Well actually is a virtual memory driver somewhat based on scullp
device in the book Linux Device Drivers 3rd edition.
Nonetheless the question is the same: a char device with mmap
implemented can get called any time a new vma is created or destroyed
(a process creating a new mmap):  vma_open() and vma_close().
But if a user process changes the mmap protections calling mprotect()?
How can the driver know about that? Is there any way to do that?
Thanks
