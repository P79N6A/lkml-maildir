Linus, please pull from the 'for-linus' branch of:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ericvh/v9fs.git/ for-linus
This tree contains the following:
Latchesar Ionkov(3):
  Reorganization of 9p file system code
  Change net/9p module name to 9pnet
  Set error to EREMOTEIO if transport write returns zero
Eric Van Hensbergen(3)
  Cache meta-data when loose cache option is set
  Renable mount-time debug option
  Fix a race condition bug in umount which caused segfault
The bulk of the changes were in the reorganization patch which mostly
moved files and interfaces around in preparation for work on an
in-kernel 9p server.
