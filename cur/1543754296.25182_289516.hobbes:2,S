No argument from me :).  I have always hated the dynamic resolution
model used by DRM/AGP and (originally) MTD.
I have a very dim and distant memory from about 6 years ago that
somebody wanted the ability to run DRM with and without AGP support.
IOW, the decision about whether to load AGP or not was left to the
user, instead of AGP always being automatically loaded by modprobe.
Again this comes down to static vs. dynamic symbol resolution.
