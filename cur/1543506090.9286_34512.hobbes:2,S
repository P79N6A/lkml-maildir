It's even easier than that.  2.2.11 and 2.3.12 onwards have a(n almost)
monotonic bounding set for many privileged operations which the kernel
kernel restricts to root (specifically, the new capability stuff).
Put ~(1 << CAP_SYS_MODULE) (actually 4294901759) into
/proc/sys/kern/cap_bset to disable the usual kernel module mechanism.
Send ~(1 << CAP_SYS_RAWIO) (4294836223) in there to protect direct against
hardware access, and /dev/port, /dev/kmem, /dev/mem and (as of 2.3.14pre1)
/proc/kcore.
With these two disabled, there should be no way to modify the kernel.
(Interesting diversion: what about systems with swappable kernel code?
We'd have to deny access to block devices too, in that case.)
Matthew.
