The ssh command is just
$ ssh kwad -L 2249:localhost:2049 -L 2248:localhost:870 -N -f
(port is forwarded to 2249 while mountport if forwarded to 2248)
Options is /proc/mounts are
rw,v2,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,tcp,nolock,addr=localhost
I just had another network failure. I ran umount -f from vt1 to see
kernel message. I waited for about 1 minute but didn't get any crash.
So I switched back to X... and got the crash then.
Looks like this crash doesn't want me to see any message...
