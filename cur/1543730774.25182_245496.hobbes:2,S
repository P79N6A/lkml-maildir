It breaks the concept of a file. In ways that offer more versatility,
challenge the imagination to make even better progress and keeps
Linux competing with competitors who are implementing this stuff
as we speak.
I for one would truly welcome the coming of thumbnails and descriptions
in picture files, because I have a real-life project going on where
that would be extremely handy to have in the actual file.
Were I any richer, I'd pay Namesys to have this work for me :)

Then I guess OS X ships a broken implementation of cp, yes?
On the cat example, what if cat < a > b simply copies the "main stream"
and not the metadata, as a feature. The key being, "as a feature"
The metadata streams could get file descriptors of their own OR
another program, streamcat or something, could be written to compensate.

With all due respect, I hope not too many people agree with you :)
