We had the three psmouse regressions below in 2.6.16-rc5.
Duncan already stated that this patch fixed (more exactly: works around) 
his problems.
Does anyone still observe a psmouse regression in 2.6.16-rc6 compared 
to 2.6.15, or is everything fine now?

Status     : Dmitry: Working on various manifestations of this one.
                     At worst we will have to disable resync by default
                     before 2.6.16 final is out and continue in 2.6.17 cycle.
