I also agree the patch shouldn't matter, but one suspect thing is the
fact add_to_swap_cache goes to clobber in a non atomic manner the page
lock. so yes, we hold the page lock both in swap_out and in
shrink_cache, but swap_out can drop it for a moment and then later
pretend to be the onwer again without a real trylock.
