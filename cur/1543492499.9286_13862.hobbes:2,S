You need capabilities directly tied to the UID or you cannot
securely eliminate root from the system.  Whether program
capabilities (which HAVE to be a subset of the capabilities
of the owner) exist in the executable or the filesystem does
not change this. One of the capabilities in question is the
ability to override UID/permission protections on files.
***
The possibility of creating a binary that
posseses a capability that the owner does not 
is one definition of a security hole.
***
Any given user is going to have a set of "standard capabilities".
- create and modify files owned by the user in directories owned by 
  the user.
- run binaries that the user/group permissions allow them to run.
An ordinary user is _NOT_ going to be able to set any capabilities
on binaries they create other than those.  However, they _may_ create
a binary that has one or both of those capabilities turned off.
A restricted user may have one or both of those capabilities turned off.
A power/admin user may have additional capabilities, for example:
- chown a file not owned by themselves
- run a file that they do not have explicit permission to run,
- perform other file operations where there is not explicit permission,
- open a TCP socket below 1024,
- assign another user the ability to use capabilities that the
  assigning user has permission for,
- mount/unmount filesystems
And others.
Many (all?) of these capabilities are currently part of "root", and
are only usable by root or SUID-root programs.  For capabilities
to work properly they still need to be tied directly to a user or
you still need root to own and control all binaries that have capabilities
beyond what an ordinary user may do.
