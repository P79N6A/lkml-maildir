Hi again!
I forgot to mention 2 other disadvantages:
- the write isn't supported in busmouse but it was in pc_keyb.c (i don't
know if it was used by any tool or not)
- Ther was a fasync fn call in psaux_release but fasync struct handled
in busmouse so i just commented it out but it works fine on my machine.
br,
