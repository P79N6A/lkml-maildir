    spinlock: lockbreak cleanup
    The break_lock data structure and code for spinlocks is quite nasty.
    Not only does it double the size of a spinlock but it changes locking to
    a potentially less optimal trylock.
    Put all of that under CONFIG_GENERIC_LOCKBREAK, and introduce a
    __raw_spin_is_contended that uses the lock data itself to determine whether
    there are waiters on the lock, to be used if CONFIG_GENERIC_LOCKBREAK is
    not set.
    Rename need_lockbreak to spin_needbreak, make it use spin_is_contended to
    decouple it from the spinlock implementation, and make it typesafe (rwlocks
    do not have any need_lockbreak sites -- why do they even get bloated up
    with that break_lock then?).

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
