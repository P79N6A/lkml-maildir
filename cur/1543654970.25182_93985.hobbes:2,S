The mount comes up fine and works for quite a while and then crashes. 
 This is under relatively heavy load (tar files being unpacked, data 
files manipulated, etc.).  No iptables/chains.
The mount is automounted,  the resulting mtab entry on IRIX is:
lego:/export/turb3 /data/turb3 nfs vers=3,rw,dev=100007 0 0
I believe the mount is UDP,  I'm not specifying any special options.
I'll look into trying nolock and v2.  SHould I try TCP?
