That's what transport classes help achieve.
We just gotta move gunk from the core (HCIL etc.) to scsi_transport_spi 
before we get there.

Mostly agreed.  Some of the firmware-based and emulated SCSI stuff is a 
bit of an I_T mix.

I think just about everybody agrees with this.
The current thread is more about the path to take, to get there...
The general point about specs is that you gotta think about them, not 
just blindly implement them.  SNIA for example is notorious for 
generating silly storage-related specifications.  And some of the T10 
stuff is... well... obviously designed by committee :)
