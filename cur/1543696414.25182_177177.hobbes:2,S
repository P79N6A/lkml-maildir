See the patch that went into Linus's tree yesterday to fix where this
would happen.
But yes, usages of these macros is touchy, and we need to get it
correct.  Your proposed patch will never allow the reference counts to
go back to zero.
Also, notice that when the kobject is initialized, the kset set by these
macros is then incremented.
