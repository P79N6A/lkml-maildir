Ok so only 32k pages to play with? I have tried parallel kernel compiles 
with mem=256m and they seemed to be fine.

Really? That means we can no longer even allocate stacks for forking.
Its surprising that neither lumpy reclaim nor the mobility patches can 
deal with it? Lumpy reclaim should be able to free neighboring pages to 
avoid the order 1 failure unless there are lots of pinned pages.
I guess then that lots of pages are pinned through I/O?
