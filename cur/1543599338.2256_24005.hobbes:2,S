Hi,
I'm not subscribed to l-k anymore since I'm not doing much kernel hacking
now - so please don't send your replies only to the list but also to me.
As you all know, on Ext2FS Partitions the SGID flag has a special function
on directories: files within that directories will be owned by the same
group that also owns the directory - which is useful for creating
directories which are shared between the members of a group.
But that only makes sense if the umask is set to give full permissions to
the group (e.g. 007 or 002). Noone would do that if there is a system-wide
'users' group - so some distributions add an extra group for every user
which lets the /etc/group file grow very fast and makes the admins life
harder ...
The following small patch adds a function to the SUID flag on directories.
If the SUID flag is set for a diectory, all new files in that directory
will get the same rights in the group-field as they have in their
user-field.  So, if one sets both - SUID and SGID - on a directory, it
will also work with a umask like 022 or 077 and there is no more need for
an extra group for every user.
Also, the SUID flag will be set to all subdirectories of a SUID directory
(as it is already now with the SGID flag on directories).
