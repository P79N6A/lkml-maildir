In fact, I am referring to the first part of my test case (i.e. mount the ext3
fs, enable medium errors in scsi_debug and try to read a file from the fs).
So, when I try to read a file, ext3_get_block() needs to read metadata from the
disk. However, given that the SCSI disk simulated by scsi_debug reports medium
errors, ext3_get_block() returns EIO to the caller (i.e. do_mpage_readpage()).
That's why get_block() is failing.
Then, do_mpage_readpage() calls block_read_full_page() (via "goto confused").
block_read_full_page() attaches buffers to this page and calls ext3_get_block()
which fails for the same reason as before. Consequently, block_read_full_page()
sets the PG_error flag.
Moreover, all subsequent readpage calls will go through block_read_full_page()
because the page has now buffers attached.
Basically, my problem is that afterwards, when the device no longer returns
any errors, the PG_error flag is never cleared and, as a result, I keep
getting -EIO. That's the problem I'd like to address.

Yes, indeed. do_generic_mapping_read() doesn't populate the pagecache if an
error occurred.
Still, __do_page_cache_readahead()->read_pages()->ext3_readpages()->mpage_readpages()
does populate the pagecache even if the page reads failed.

I don't think so, unless I'm missing something.

The PageError pages are part of a regular file and have been read through
readahead.
