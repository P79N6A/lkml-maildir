Subject: 2.4.20aa1 patch reversing problems.

I got the full 2.4.20aa1 patch and patched a pristine 2.4.20. No
problems there. I then wanted to reverse all the XFS patches to apply
the latest stuff. To my surprise, I can't reverse several of the patches
without error. (at least 3 of the 7{0,1}_* patches)
I'm not sure why this would be, I've gone in order, and reverse order,
and I still get problems. It seems quite odd to me that this would
happen...since I thought the split patches would be in the full patch as
well. 
Is something amiss here? Help and advice is much appreciated.
