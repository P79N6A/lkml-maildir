hello
something similar:
catting /proc/bus/pnp/devices makes my system oops, doing it twice makes my 
system crash :p
the oops looks very much like the oops (also bad EIP value, also no stack 
trace) i get on boot with the first patch (below) applied. As i already 
mailed, i need to revert that patch to make my system boot.
this oops happens with all 3 patches below reverted, so i guess it'll happen 
too with stock test9.
would the -mm5 pnp-fix-4.patch be worth a try ? it seems related
thanks,
greetings,
frank
