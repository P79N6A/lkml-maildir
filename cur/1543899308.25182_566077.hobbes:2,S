If you're looking for someone to blame, consider the fact that this has
gone away now I've switched back to slab. :)

That patch was a straw man for Marcel to comment on, not necessarily a
real fix. I don't know the code that well, and naïvely reordering bits
of it could have introduced another race which I just haven't triggered
yet.
Strictly speaking, it wasn't a 2.6.22 regression either -- I actually
saw it for the first time in 2.6.21-rc iirc.
Thanks for tracking these, btw. It's very useful.
