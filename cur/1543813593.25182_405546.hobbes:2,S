That does seem reasonable, but I'm looking at total system load, not per 
runqueue. So a global_weighted_load() function would be required to return 
that. Because despite what anyone seems to want to believe, reading from disk 
hurts. Why it hurts so much I'm not really sure, but it's not a SCSI vs IDE 
with or without DMA issue. It's not about tweaking parameters. It doesn't 
seem to be only about cpu cycles. This is not a mistuned system that it 
happens on. It just plain hurts if we do lots of disk i/o, perhaps it's 
saturating the bus or something. Whatever it is, as much as I'd _like_ swap 
prefetch to just keep working quietly at ultra ultra low priority, the disk 
reads that swap prefetch does are not innocuous so I really do want them to 
only be done when nothing else wants cpu.
Cheers,
