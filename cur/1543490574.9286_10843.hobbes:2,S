Debian effectively does this via their /etc/alternatives symlink nest. It
provides the same "mapping" functionality of the patch completely in user
space, runs scripts from other unices, and doesn't modify the kernel. And
I don't know about other people but I haven't been bit by an incorrect #!
in over a decade. Packages systems like Debian make the problem even more
unlikely to occur in the future, at least for the typical user.
