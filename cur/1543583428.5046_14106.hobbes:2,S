That means that there's a bug in someone's driver.
For some reason, the function to decrement the module use is called more
than once when a controlling process releases use of a module. 
This will prevent you from being able to 'rmmod' or 'modprobe -r' it; a
"Device or resource busy" error or similar will result IIRC. 
Submit a bug to the driver maintainer.
