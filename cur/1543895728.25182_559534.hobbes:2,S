Your controller is repeatedly reporting PHY readiness changed exception.
 Are you reading the system image from the device attached to the first
SATA port?

The error handling itself tries very hard to ensure that there is no
data corruption in case of errors.  All commands which experience
exceptions are retried but if the drive itself is doing something
stupid, there's only so much the driver can do.
How reproducible is the problem?  Does the problem go away or occur more
often if you change the drive you write the memory image to?
