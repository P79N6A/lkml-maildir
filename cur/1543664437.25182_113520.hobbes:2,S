Feel free to bug me with kbuild related issues.
In this area Roman is 'only' taking care of kconfig & related issues AFAIK.

I have tried before - no luck.
This one happens due to a $(Q)$(MAKE) used as part of a $(if

See around line 335 - 345.
It requires more than trivial changes to get rid of this one.
