>RT-LSM introduces architectural problems in the form of bogus API. And
that may be true of LSM, but not RT-LSM in particular. RT-LSM doesn't
introduce *any* API whatsoever - it simply allows software to call
various existing APIs (mostly from POSIX) and have them not fail as
result of not being root and/or not running on a capabilities-enabled
kernel without the required caps.
No audio apps "use" RT-LSM in any way - it just lets them do things
they otherwise could not do. And all the alternatives to RT-LSM have
this feature as well - controlling rlimits won't be done by the audio
apps, but by some part of the security infrastructure.

We haven't encouraged anyone to ship anything with it on by default:
the idea is for the module to be present and usable, not turned on.
