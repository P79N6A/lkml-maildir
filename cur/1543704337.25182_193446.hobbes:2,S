My Dell C840 got bit by the 8.19 bogomips too, and I found some MORE damage
caused by this.
2.6.2-rc1-mm1 with X86_PM_TIMER finds my Ethernet cards just fine.
2.6.2-rc1-mm2, the 3c59x driver fails to find the MAC address for the cards:
(the Xircom pcmcia (eth2 below) and Orinoco wireless (eth3) drivers *do* find
their cards):

(eth0 is the onboard ethernet, eth1 was the one on the docking station). lspci says:

Building without X86_PM_TIMER the 3c905 is found:
