My name is Tom and I am new to the open source world.  I was a PC and AS400 
programmer for many years and have turned my focus entirely toward linux as I 
am disabled now with plenty of free time.  I can't find any highly technical 
manuals for the latest linux kernels explaining their functioning.  Maybe 
such a thing is not compiled and must be gotten from decentralized sources.  
Could someone tell me a book or something, especially for the 4Mpg kernel.  I 
want to know pretty much how it works from a programmers perspective and 
module interface.  I'd like to write a  module for the ICH5 disk controller 
in native mode that doesn't rely on a qnx micro kernel file system like the  
Window's version does.  I would really appreciate the help.
Tom
