I wasn't aware of the little detail.  I re-tested with hashdist=1 and
this time it shows a slowdown of about 3%-4% on a 4-Way Power5 system 
(2 NUMA nodes) with 64GB.  Don't see a big problem if the things is off
by default on non IA64 systems though.

Serves me right for not reading the entire thread. :)
