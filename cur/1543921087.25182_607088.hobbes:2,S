They don't -- that's why I asked if you need both scenario's active at the 
same time. SIGDANGER would just be SIGPLEASEFREEALLYOUCAN with the operator 
deciding through setting the level at which point applications get it.
Or put differently; what's the additional value of notifying an application 
that the system is about to go balistic when you've already asked it to free
all it could earlier? SIGSEEDAMNITITOLDYOUSO?
Don't get me wrong; never saw this discussion earlier, may be sensible...
Rene.
