I use the 'map_user_kiobuf' and 'lock_kiovec' kernel routines in a module
for 'user space memory'. After that if I pass the
'(iobuf->maplist[0])-mem_map) <<  PAGE_SHIFT)' to the hardware for DMA
operations and it works fine for Intel platforms. Now how can I use the
'iobuf' struct obtained after lock_kiovec operation to get a PCI bus
address that I can pass to hardware for DMA operations on my Apple
machine.?
thanks,
Daljeet.

Wrong approach, you can use kiobufs if you want DMA to the malloc()ed
userspace memory:
 * lock down the user memory using map_user_kiobuf() + lock_kiovec()
   (see linux/iobuf.h).
 * translate the iobuf->maplist into a scatterlist [1]
 * feed pci_map_sg() with the scatterlist to get DMA addresses.
   you can pass to the hardware.
And the reverse to free everything when you are done of course.

[1] IMHO it would be more useful if iobufs would use a scatterlist
    instead of an struct page* array.
