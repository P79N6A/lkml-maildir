The device node name?  From the rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/*.  Udev is
the one which creates it in the first place, deriving it in a
user-defined way from the sysfs information.  It does _not_ give back
that information to the kernel.  Maybe it should.

The kernel does not provide a cd burning service, only a scsi packet
transport service called SG_IO.
The kernel *does* provide a device enumeration service, only it does
it at this point through udev for reasons that are 50% technical and
50% political.  If you want to be able to use a 2.6 kernel with
hotplug devices udev[1] is mandatory.  As such, from an engineering
point of view, udev is part of the kernel even if it isn't in the
source tarball on kernel.org.  And for now it is the lowest level
interface to device enumeration.
  OG.
[1] Or hotplug, maybe.
