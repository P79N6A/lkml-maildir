    Yep. I've argued for fairness here, and that is presently what
    we get. Between nodes the threshold should probably be higher
    though.
While I like the idea of a self-tuning scheduler, when combined with
this new sched_domain algorithm it's hard to tell if the tuning or the
algorithm is at fault when we get results we don't like.  Have you done
much running with the auto-tuning turned off, using the old values,
to see the impact (positive or negative) that just the new algorithm has?
