FAT has to fill the hole completely, but DIO doesn't seems to do.
e.g.
        fd = open("file", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC);
        write(fd, buf, 512);
        lseek(fd, 10000, SEEK_SET);
        write(fd, buf, 512);
We need to allocate the blocks on 512 ~ 10000, and fill it with zero.
However, I think DIO doesn't fill it. If I'm missing something, please
let me know, I'll kill that check.
Thanks.
