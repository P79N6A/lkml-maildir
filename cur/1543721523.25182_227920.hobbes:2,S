Subject: ip6_tables warning (was: Re: Linux 2.4.27-pre6)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is not a new problem, but I never bothered to report it before:
| ip6_tables.c: In function `tcp_match':
| ip6_tables.c:1596: warning: implicit declaration of function `ipv6_skip_exthdr'
It needs to include <net/ipv6.h> to kill the warning.
Sorry, no patch, since my development machine is offline.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
