on my debian (unstable) laptop newly running 2.6.0, i've noticed
an irritating tendency for music to not pause, but instead to
try to go too fast, skipping small parts of the song (fractions
of a second).  this results in music with regular beats sounding
erratic.
i'm using gqmpeg -> mpg123-esd -> esd -> oss -> alsa (maestro3).
switching esd to use -tcp instead of -unix seems to alleviate
the trouble a bit.  ogg123 playing through esd doesn't seem to
do it as much either.
has anyone else noted this problem and tuned it away?  thanks.
