Note that my email simply describes a long term target.  For the short 
term, and perhaps medium term, libata will continue to use 
->eh_strategy_handler().
Given Mark's messages, my own knowledge, and other reports, there 
continues to be room for improvement in the current EH code.
In general, we need to distinguish between PCI bus errors, SATA bus 
errors, and ATA device errors, and handle each error class 
appropriately.  In the SCSI layer, ->eh_strategy_handler() or no, this 
will likely consist of taking the SCSI device offline and dealing with 
the error(s).
