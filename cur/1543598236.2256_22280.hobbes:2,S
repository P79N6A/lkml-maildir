It's a custom embedded system.  The designers have a few details and a
picture (the BIOS runs on cases 1 and 3) here:
http://www.varisys.co.uk/custom.html
The BIOS code is at
http://www.humboldt.co.uk/gbios.html
The BIOS is actually scriptable in TCL (Python or Perl wouldn't fit in 
the ROM). I'll port the latest version back to the Sandpoint reference 
platform soon.

Approximately true. If you have ECC memory then it will have to be 
cleared in the BIOS, because of write-back caching. The first time you 
write to a memory location, the processor reads in the whole cache line 
containing that information. If the memory wasn't cleared, the ECC codes 
for the data are wrong, and you get an unrecoverable ECC error 
interrupt. What actually happens probably depends on the BIOS version.
