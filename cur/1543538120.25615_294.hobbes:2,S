no, its a (failed) attempt at greco-roman rhetoric. i was just trying
to make an allusion to the fact that nobody can point to any
particular place in the kernel that prevents a SCHED_FIFO runnable
thread from making back onto the processor quickly. in fact, most
people who know about such things believe that fixing it given the
current kernel would require patching all kinds of "random" locations
where something is done to prevent this (presumably desirable and
correct) behaviour from happening.
so somehow, despite the fact that it would seem extremely desirable
that if current->need_resched is set, the processor should be context
switching ASAP, we've ended up with a system where that does not
happen. no, i know its not because of a bunch of random hacks. i'm
just not good enough with rhetoric to have gotten the feel for this
across.
