Hi,
       Okay the VIA DRM people have asked to include it in the kernel, it
only allows accelerated XvMC for non-root users, and 3d for root users
(the 3d paths are still not secure)...
The bk tree at
bk://drm.bkbits.net/drm-via
the patch against Linus latest (along with some cleanup patches...)
is at (it is quite big...)
http://www.skynet.ie/~airlied/patches/dri/via_unichrome_patch.diff
Can VIA people test this tree for me? either use bk or grab Linus latest
and apply the patch...
Dave.
