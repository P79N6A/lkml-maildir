I just had one more of these thrown at me by 2.3.5 smp:
 kmem_grow: Called nonatomically from int - size-32 
I was busy dailing my ISP via ppp at the time. 
It happens while my ip-up script is running, possibly while named is 
starting up, because the next line in my syslog invariably is a named 
message with the same timestamp. It does not happen every time, though,
and I failed to trigger it on demand when repteatedly restarting named 
while not connected. 
Based on when I started getting these, my guess is that this got 
introduced in 2.3.4 or 2.3.5. I've scanned both patches, but am not 
enough of a kernel guru to spot the change responsible for it.
Want more info? Just ask!
