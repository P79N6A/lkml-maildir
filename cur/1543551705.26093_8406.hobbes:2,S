You're right. If someone want to hack kernel but he knows only perl it's not
a good idea to write source in perl and apply that patch into the kernel
tree somehow ;-) I think everything can be done in C because C is Turing
compatible language. We can use many-many languages because 'they have
got some nice features' but everything can be done in simple C as well !
This casue much easier maintaing not counting the fact that not every kernel
hacker know C++, only C. Let's inmageine a superb programming language.
Linux kernel at this point won't include sources written in 'superb'.
Because it's hard to maintain, not every hacker know it and it make
diffult to cooperate (interfacing between the two languages, ugly hacks
to do that, slower and bigger code).
