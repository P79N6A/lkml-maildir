I am plowing along as I am learning about the in'n'outs about i386.  I am
totally stuck on this one.  I would appreciate any help.
As you can see, the function turns off paging mode (of course it
runs from identically mapped page) and tries to jump to an absolute
address at 0x10000000.  It appears the machine would reboot when running
"ljmp" instruction.
Any pointers?
I was not too certain about the %cs, %ds business and did quite 
a few experiments with different values but with no luck.
Thanks in advance.
