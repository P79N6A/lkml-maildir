Seems that this will only delay the lock in spa_svr but not inhibit it.

It's a bare bone scheduler that allows to prioritize procs to the admins 
desire, instead of leaving the priority management to the scheduler, which

And that's why the same problem exists in the child scheds, i.e. spa_ws, 
spa_svr, zaphod, but not spa_ebs.
