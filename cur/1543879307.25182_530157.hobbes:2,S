If you really need a ton of ports you could probably build a 1U server
with 2 * 2-port 10gig NICs, and use VLAN-capable switches with 10gig
and 1gig ports to fan out each 10gig link from your server to 10 1-gig
ports.  That would get you 40 ports of 1-gig from each server (plus
whatever the server has on board).
