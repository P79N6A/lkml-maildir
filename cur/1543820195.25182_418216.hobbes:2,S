Interesting approach. However, I'm worrying about hurting interactive
response by this change.

If nice is changed, the task priority is also changed. I don't think
changing the task priority for this purpose is a good choice, but
only lengthen the timeslice would work and that is what I'm considering.
Another obvious bad case is an imbalanced number of runnable tasks
in the different groups. Since minimum timeslice is 1 tick,
minimum share is the factor of number of runnable tasks in the group.
If 1% share group contains 99 runnable tasks and the other 99% share
group has just one runnable task, the load of the two groups would be
the same. (It becomes worse in small HZ configuration.)
I've tried different approach to compensate for this badness.
Which is to requeue the starving tasks to the active as if they are
TASK_INTERACTIVE, but it sometimes hurt system response and other
undesirable side effect was observed.
Now, I'm thinking to enlarge the timeslice of starving groups.
Thanks,
