But how would HAL safely determine whether a (IDE/USB) drive is busy?
As my test app demonstrates (without HAL running), the *very first* open()
happening during an ongoing burning operation will kill it instantly, in the
USB case.
Are there any options left for HAL at all? Still seems to strongly point
towards a kernel issue so far.
One (rather less desireable) way I can make up might be to have HAL
keep the device open permanently and do an ioctl query on whether it's "busy"
and then quickly close the device again before the newly started
burning process gets disrupted (if this even properly works at all).
