The dmesg you attached says this:
< ACPI disabled because your bios is from 00 and too old
< You can enable it with acpi=force
...
< ACPI: Interpreter disabled.
So I'd expect the CONFIG_ACPI !CONFIG_APM kernel to fail to poweroff the
system.

Did you configure with ACPI in 2.4.21?
If you configured with APM in 2.4.21, you might consider sticking with
it rather than switching to ACPI in 2.4.22.
Also, if there is a BIOS update available for this system you should
consider it.
