And this will actually do what?  Elaborate please.
I think my problem is that somehow, the dvb stuff now has a dependency
on the nxt200x thing, whatever it is, as if I force a kernel build
without it, then I get depmod problems at the end of the build telling
me:
WARNING:/lib/modules/2.6.15-rc2/kernel/drivers/media/video/cx88/cx88-dvb
.ko needs unknown symbol nxt200x_attach.
This was never a requirement up thru 2.6.14.2, and I didn't try 15-rc1
as the -rc1's are usually a disaster of some kind, and this is also my
main box.  I don't need a filesystem muckup again.
So whatever did that seems in error to me, and should be backed out in
favor of some other method to bring in the nxt200x bearing cards.
