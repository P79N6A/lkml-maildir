Subject: newer parallel ZIP (2.2.1 imm.o buggy)

I tried using both an older and a newer parallel ZIP drives on my laptop,
using kernel 2.2.1.
ppa works perfectly for the older.
imm doesn't work for the newer.
My machine supports SPP and PS/2.
I suspect imm is trying to use EPP/16 whereas it shouldn't.
I'm trying to debug the whole thing.
Regards,
David
