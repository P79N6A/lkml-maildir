Subject: RPC switches into debug mode

Code fragment from net/sunrpc/sched.c, 2.2 and 2.3 kernels.
#ifdef RPC_DEBUG
        if (task->tk_magic != 0xf00baa) {
                printk(KERN_ERR "RPC: attempt to wake up non-existing task!\n");
                rpc_debug = ~0;
                rpc_show_tasks();
                return;
        }
#endif
When that test triggers, every following RPC operation is logged.  It
*really* slows down NFS until somebody spots it and resets rpc_debug.
Why is rpc_debug set to ~0?  If this debug is useful, could it be
automatically reset after a few seconds?  And is anybody interested in
an 2.2.12 RPC debug log for this message?
