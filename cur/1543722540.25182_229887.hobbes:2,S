A testcase would be, on a 2G box:
a) free up as much memory as you can
b) write a 1.2G file to fill highmem with pagecache
c) malloc(800M), bzero(), sleep
d) swapoff -a
You now have a box which has almost all of lowmem pinned in anonymous
memory.  It'll limp along and go oom fairly easily.
Another testcase would be:
a) free up as much memory as you can
b) write a 1.2G file to fill highmem with pagecache
c) malloc(800M), mlock it
You now have most of lowmem mlocked.
In both situations the machine is really sick.  Probably the most risky
scenario is a swapless machine in which lots of lowmem is allocated to
anonymous memory.
It should be the case that increasing lower_zone_peotection will fix all
the above.  If not, it needs fixing.
So we're down the question "what should we default to at bootup".  I find
it hard to justify defaulting to a mode where we're super-defensive against
this sort of thing, simply because nobody seems to be hitting the problems.
Distributors can, if the must, bump lower_zone_protection in initscripts,
and it's presumably pretty simple to write a boot script which parses
/proc/meminfo's MemTotal and SwapTotal lines, producing an appropriate
lower_zone_protection setting.
