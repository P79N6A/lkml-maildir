This could be the problem where fragmented memory causes atomic higher
order allocations to fail, for which there is a fix in -mm, which should
make its way into 2.6.11.
Also, the increased atomic memory reserves in current 2.6-bk should
alleviate the problem.
As a temporary workaround, you can increase /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes
BTW. what does `free` say when the allocation failures are happening?
