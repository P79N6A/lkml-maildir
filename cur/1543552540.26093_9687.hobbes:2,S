I dunno. The main reason I'd like to get the block devices into the page
cache is that right now there is no way to mmap them - something that can
potentially be _very_ useful, regardless of readahead.
And quite frankly, the generic file readahead has been pounded upon and
tested a lot more than the block device read-ahead ever was. I bet it
performs better if for no other reason.
