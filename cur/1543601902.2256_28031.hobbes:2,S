Is this something Linux could recognize and patch, like the Athlon problem
with the VIA chipset? Linux works around many bugs, this would be just
another in the init portion, which is released when complete and has no
runtime penalty.
However, I thought this was something disabled in SMP mode, since it used
to work with a uni build. I'll have to look again, I would really like to
have a clean power-down after running long term stuff to completion.
