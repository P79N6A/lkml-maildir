Ah, OK didn't know that ... however, I'm not convinced that panicing is 
really that useful ... what happens if you proceed? IIRC, this is before 
console_init as well, so people won't even see the error. At least it 
should only do that on machines that are borked in such a fashion - 99% of 
machines will work fine, AFAICS.
