This interpretation puts kernel developers in the
position of making the legal decision about which
interfaces cause derivate-work risk and which
do not.  That's hardly a recipe for legal clarity.
(Not that legal clarity is a goal of Linux
kernel development... :-)
Different developers are likely to have
different viewpoints on which interfaces pose risks.
I guess Linus gets the last call (as usual),
so there's some possibility of some amount
of uniformity here.
Most kernel developers will naturally tend
towards making more symbols EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL,
whether there's valid legal basis for it or not.
(Please let me know if there's a lawyer somewhere
reviewing the insertion of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPLs)
David currently suggests that *all* interfaces
be so designated.  I suspect he strongly believes
that any use of a kernel interface creates a
derivative work.  I have a different opinion.

Well, if it makes sense to have developers giving out legal
advice, then I guess so.
