It's not a personal issue. Generally, I like UTF-8.
I'm simply saying that allowing UTF-8 in MODULE_AUTHOR and printk's as 
you want to can have unwanted effects.
And I gave modinfo as an example for a tool that is not yet able to 
handle UTF-8 correctly in all cases.
In my opinion, it's not worth the hassle to allow UTF-8 there.
Feel free to disagree.

Agreed, if we allow a non-ASCII charset, it should be UTF-8.
