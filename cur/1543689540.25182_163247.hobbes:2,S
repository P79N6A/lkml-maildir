I hadn't thought of that.
I wonder if it's useful, though.  The only time it's likely to not set
the flag with it not already set, in real use, is when other VM code
calls remap_file_pages() with the whole vma.  But then the flag is
cleared by the next line.
So it's correct and nice, but I'm not sure it adds anything practical.
