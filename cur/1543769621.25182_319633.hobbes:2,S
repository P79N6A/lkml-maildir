I am using a Promise TX4 SATAII150 controller. I have the same issue on
multiple hardwares (different boards, different processors). I am very
sure it is not a problem with the cableing or any other part in the box,
because I exchanged every part behind the controller with other parts.
HDD's and cables work excellent on a ICH6.
I tried with the latest stable kerenel (2.6.11.x) and even with the
newer 2.6.12rc4 where ordered flushing was introduced, but it does not
solve the problem.
Any ideas ?
Regards
Andre Russ
