I guess I don't follow.  How would the load balancer know that it needs 
to run?  Running on every task wake-up seems expensive.  Also, static 
priority isn't everything.  What about the gang-scheduler concept where 
certain tasks must be scheduled simultaneously on different cpus?  What 
about a resource-group scenario where you have per-cpu resource limits, 
so that for good latency/fairness you need to force a high priority task 
to migrate to another cpu once it has consumed the cpu allocation of 
that group on the current cpu?
I can see having a generic load balancer core code, but it seems to me 
that the scheduler proper needs to have some way of triggering the load 
balancer to run, and some kind of goodness functions to indicate a) 
which tasks to move, and b) where to move them.
