Well, Linus makes mistakes like everyone else. Besides, he himself
also recommends that people build kernels as non-root :
"I would suggest that people who compile new kernels should:
...
 - compile the kernel in their own home directory, as their very own
   selves. No need to be root to compile the kernel. You need to be root
   to _install_ the kernel, but that's different. "

 for the
source of that quote.
