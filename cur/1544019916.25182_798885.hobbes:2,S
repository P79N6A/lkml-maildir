IPPROTO_MH is only defined in linux/in6.h, but inclusion of it:
/usr/include/linux/in6.h:31: error: redefinition of ■struct in6_addr■
/usr/include/linux/in6.h:52: error: redefinition of ■struct sockaddr_in6■
/usr/include/linux/in6.h:60: error: redefinition of ■struct ipv6_mreq■
Ick. That's even worse than tunnels.
