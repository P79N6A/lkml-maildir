It's a bit similar to the pm_trace thing.
As long as there is a sane default (ie. the consoles are disabled), I don't see
a big problem with that.
Moreover, distributions will probably want to have a switch so that they can
tell the user "please do 'echo 1 > ...' and retest" and if they start to add
such things by themselves that wouldn't be nice.
