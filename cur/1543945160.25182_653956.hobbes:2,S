Subject: [PATCH 01/12] PCI: remove pci_find_present
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/14/510

No one is using this function anymore for quite some time, so remove it.
Everyone calls pci_dev_present() instead anyway...
