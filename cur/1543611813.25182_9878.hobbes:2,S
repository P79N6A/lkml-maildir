Nathan, thanks for taking the time to merge these.  I've got some more 
stuff here that I've done just recently for ANK, and a few moments of 
spare time.  If you'll send me the last version of the .c file you had, 
I can probably do a pretty quick merge of everthing together (I need the 
.c file instead of the patch because I'm not starting from the same 
source you are).  Hopefully, between your efforts and the feedback I've 
gotten in the last few days, we can send a final version to Marcello for 
the 2.4 kernel series that actually works well.
