I figured out why my IP takeover was taking a couple seconds to take
effect even though it returned immediately--the
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/min_delay setting is by default set to 2,
giving a 2 second delay before the route cache is updated or flushed. 
This meant that packets continued to go out the old interface for two
seconds, until the route cache was flushed and the new route was used.
Now what I'm trying to figure out is why anyone would want this value to
NOT be set to zero.  When would you not want route flushes and route
changes to take immediate effect?
Thanks again,
Chris
