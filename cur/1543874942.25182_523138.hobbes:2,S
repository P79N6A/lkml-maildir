So can you bisect to find what caused the problem?
We've been afflicted with such strange overcurrent messages
off and on for some time.  Some hardware triggers them, while
most doesn't, and the USB developers don't have any of the
hardware that triggers it (that almost goes without saying).
It's been clear to me that _something_ the software does is
making that more likely to happen.
One thing we've been lacking is anything like a usable clue
as to what kind of changes would have that failure mode ...
and thus, what kind of changes could remove it.
