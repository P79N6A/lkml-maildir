Based on reading this thread and some articles referenced and searched, it
would appear that EVMS and LVM2 could/should use the same underpining,
such as device-mapper. If you have two competing planes they should still
land on the same runway. That way other software could be written which
did still other things, or the same things in different ways. Having two
kinds of lowest level under them seems like more code to maintain than is
necessary, and may lead to conflicts if both are in use. I know the EVMS
folks say that won't happen, and there's a good reason for having two
groups inventing the wheel, but I'd feel better if ther was one wheel and
a single API which all *VM* software could use.
I suspect that there's som NIH involved...
