The libc headers end up including kernel headers via the sym-links.
They must *only* use the headers with which libc was built. Therefore,
any sym-links should be removed and replaced with a copy of the
appropriate headers.

Again, the C-library was built to work with certain structures
(for instance) that existed at the time it was built. Let's say
I use /usr/include/sys/stat.h to get the structure members of
'struct stat'. If I use the headers that existed at the time the
C library was built, all is fine. If I use the kernel headers
that exist now, the offsets may be incorrect because there have
may have been members added to that structure.
This comes about because the C library used kernel headers,
which it shouldn't have done in the first place.
FYI, you __never__ include C library headers when building
any kernel modules.
Cheers,
