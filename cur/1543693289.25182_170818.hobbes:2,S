People really should start making a habit of reading documentation when
upgrading things, especially when they know they have a problem. If you
read the SBP2 section on linux1394.org, you'll see where it says that
later versions of 2.4 need the rescan-scsi-bus.sh script. It also
explains why, and links to the script.
