I have:
Linux video capture interface: v1.00
bttv: driver version 0.7.63 loaded
bttv: using 2 buffers with 2080k (4160k total) for capture
bttv: Host bridge needs ETBF enabled.
bttv: Bt8xx card found (0).
bttv0: Bt878 (rev 2) at 00:0b.0, irq: 10, latency: 32, memory: 0xe3000000
bttv0: subsystem: 144f:3000  =>  TView 99 (CPH063)  =>  card=38
bttv0: model: BT878(TView99 CPH063) [autodetected]
bttv0: enabling ETBF (430FX/VP3 compatibilty)
i2c-core.o: adapter bt848 #0 registered as adapter 0.
 working in 2.4.5-ac12 SMP+RAID.  I used
Bttv-0.7.63-2.4.3.patch.bz2
from the website.  Video4linux has always worked in the various 2.4
kernels I've tried.
>and accesing mod_video, the box locked up hard (not even sysrq worked).  And
I don't run mod_video, but xawtv works fine.  Did you try that or
rebuilding mod_video?

You must have grues.
