Subject: [PATCH] Dell inspiron multimedia keys need to be assigned keycodes

Hi,
I have a Dell I8200, and tried to dig into the issue of why the
multimedia keys which worked fine in v2.4, stopped working in v2.6.
What I found (which may be new to some Dell users who are not familiar
with the new internals, such as myself) is the following:
The basic problem is the new (wrt 2.4) mandatory passage through the
input layer.
In 2.4, under X, the keyboard was in RAW mode, and the server got the
scancodes and did whatever
it did with them.  In a vt, the keyboard is in XLATE mode, and
complains it cannot process these keys, but who cares.
Now, in 2.6, the keyboard ALWAYS translates keys, passes them
translated through the input layer,
and on the other side, if we are under X, then keyboard.c
un-translates them to emulate the good old RAW mode. 
So there are two issues:  first, atkbd.c must be taught how to
translate these keys to something
meaningful.  Since in 2.4 they are not translated at all, I just had
to come up with SOMETHING.  I
am not sure these are the best keycodes to translate to, but they work
fine for me: just plain 129-132.
Then, keyboard.c must be taught how to un-translate these back to the
good old e0 01 -- e0 04.
I would appreciate any comment to whether these translated codes may
cause conflicts; and if not, than on behalf of Dell Inspiron users,
please apply the patch below.
Thanks,
Itay
