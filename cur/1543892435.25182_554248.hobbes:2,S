if the infrastructure your are advocating does not allow us to keep the 
existing output then it's simply not flexible enough. Why on earth are 
you even arguing about this? A "cleanup" should not change the output, 
simple as that. Do a patch that has the _same_ output and then we can 
see whether it's a good patch. You made the same mistake with your 
/proc/timer_stats cleanups. I dont like NACK-ing patches but you seem to 
be missing the basic precondition of cleanups: no functional effect to 
the code, and certainly no change in output.
