Of course it is appropriate. Day's response is very strange
indeed. As part of a student's research, he should ask questions
of people who are likely to know some answers about his query.
In fact, if students for which I am an adviser didn't ask such
questions, and simply selected a project, I would question
the validity of the project. Projects are not selected in
a vacuum. Just like "real world" industry, there must be
a need (read market) for the project (read product).
Cheers,
