Subject: [GIT PATCH] ACPI patches for 2.6.24-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
please pull from:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git release
This request is larger than I'd prefer at -rc3,
but as I wasn't available for an -rc2 merge, some things waited until now.
The good news is that the larger text changes are low risk.
The EC changes are tweaks to the -rc0 update --
as we've learned about new and creative ways that vendors
can make their EC's violate spec...  Thanks to Alexey for
being extremely responsive in debugging these...
Fixed a popular battery oops regression.
Fixed a boot hang on some unusual AMD boxes seen with the new CPU_IDLE.
Fixed a long-standing IRQ8 issue that some OEMs
and Linux distros are eagerly awaiting.
Fixed the processor throttling extensions that we first
started supporting in 2.6.23.  The reality is that it took
until now to properly test the code, as only very new platforms
have it.
And a couple of small cleanups -- the larger ones are waiting for 2.6.25.
thanks!
-Len
ps. individual patches are available on linux-acpi@vger.kernel.org

    ACPI: fix two IRQ8 issues in IOAPIC mode
    
    Use mp_irqs[] to get PNP device's interrupt polarity and trigger.
    There are two reasons to do this:
    1. BIOS bug for PNP interrupt
    2. BIOS explictly does override
    mp_irqs[] should cover all the cases.

    cpuidle: fix HP nx6125 regression
    
    Fix for 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9355
    
    cpuidle always used to fallback to C2 if there is some bm activity while
    entering C3. But, presence of C2 is not always guaranteed. Change cpuidle
    algorithm to detect a safe_state to fallback in case of bm_activity and
    use that state instead of C2.

    ACPI: thinkpad-acpi: fix oops when a module parameter has no value
    
    set_ibm_param() could OOPS with a NULL pointer derreference if one did not give
    any values for a module parameter it handles.  This would, of course, cause all
    sort of trouble for future modprobing and require a reboot to clean up
    properly.
    
    Fix it by returning -EINVAL if no values are given for the parameter, and also
    avoid any nastyness from BUG_ON while at it.

    EC driver in this particular case has fake _INI method, not present on

    its presence as a flag for early init.

    ACPI: Use _TSS for throttling control, when present. Add error checks.
    
    _TSS was erroneously ignored, in favor of the FADT.
    
    When TSS is used, the access width is included in the PTC control/status
    register.  So it is unnecessary that the access bit width is multiplied by 8.
    At the same time the bit_offset should be considered for system I/O Access.
    
    It should be checked the bit_width and bit_offset of PTC regsiter in order to
    avoid the failure of system I/O access. It means that bit_width plus
    bit_offset can't be greater than 32.

    ACPI: Enforce T-state limit changes immediately
    
    When a T-state limit change notification is received,
    Linux must evaluate _TPC and change its current
    T-state immediately to comply with the new limit.
    
    Previously, Linux would notice the new limit
    only upon the next throttling change.

    ACPI: Always return valid 'status' from acpi_battery_get_property()
    
    If a battery is at a critical charge level and not being charged or
    discharged, then the ACPI _BST method will return a state of 4, and
    the current acpi_battery_get_property() code will not set any property
    value for POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_STATUS.  This will cause an oops in
    power_supply_show_property() when it reads off the end of the
    status_text array.  This actually was causing a 100% reproducible
    crash on boot on my laptop with two batteries, when one battery was
    completely drained and the laptop was not plugged in.
    
    Fix this by making sure acpi_battery_get_property() returns
    POWER_SUPPLY_STATUS_UNKNOWN for any battery state it doesn't already
    handle explicitly.  There doesn't seem to be any status enum value
    defined that makes more sense than 'unknown' for a battery at a
    critical charge level.

    ACPI: thinkpad-acpi: allow for syscall restart in sysfs handlers
    
    Map an mutex_lock_interruptible() error return into ERESTARTSYS, as the
    only possible error from mutex_lock_interruptible is EINTR, and that will
    only happen if signal_pending() causes the mutex lock attempt to abort.
    
    This still allows signals to be delivered ASAP, which is much nicer than
    just doing mutex_lock, and still shadows userspace from EINTR when
    SA_RESTART is active.

    ACPI: thinkpad-acpi: prefer standard ACPI backlight level control
    
    Newer Lenovo BIOSes support the standard ACPI backlight brightness
    interface (_BCM, _BQC, _BCL).  It should be used instead of the native
    thinkpad backlight brightness control interface when possible.
    
    This patch disables the native brightness support in the driver by default
    when we detect that the standard ACPI interface is available.  The local
    admin can still enable it using the module parameter "brightness_enable".
    
    Note that we need to detect the standard ACPI backlight interface only in
    boxes for which we would load the native backlight interface in the first
    place, and that no ThinkPad BIOS has _BCL but misses the other methods, so
    the detection routines can be really simple.

    Add a "brightness_enable" module parameter that allows the local admin to

    It can also be used to force the backlight support to be enabled, but that
    is currently a no-op as the backlight support is enabled by default when
    available.  This will be changed by a different patch.

    ACPI: thinkpad-acpi: support 16 levels of brightness (v3)
    
    Lenovo ThinkPads often have 16 brightness levels in EC, and not just eight
    levels like older ThinkPads.  They also have standard ACPI backlight
    brightness control.
    
    We detect the number of brightness levels by the presence of a BCLL package
    with 16 entries.  If BCLL is not there, we assume eight levels (Z6*).  If
    it is there, but it doesn't have 16 entries, we assume eight levels (T60).
    Otherwise we assume sixteen levels (T61, X61, etc).
    
    We don't use _BCL because it can have side-effects in thinkpads.  Thanks to
    Thomas Renninger <trenn@suse.de> for notifying me of this potential
    problem.
    
    Using the standard ACPI backlight brightness control *instead* of the
    native thinkpad backlight control is a better idea, though.  A different
    patch will take care of this.

    ACPI: thinkpad-acpi: revert keymap changes
    
    Revert commit fba956c46a72f9e7503fd464ffee43c632307e31, "Map volume and
    brightness events on thinkpads".
    
    That commit made some modifications to the default keymaps that cause bad
    behaviour on all IBM ThinkPads if HAL doesn't know to change them into
    passive (on-screen-display only) events.
    
    The proper solution for IBM ThinkPads is to use the _NOTIFY version of the
    key codes for the IBM default map (which are not available in mainline
    yet), and for the Lenovo keymap, it will take some studying of the various
    DSDTs and testing to know the best path (which I will do shortly).
