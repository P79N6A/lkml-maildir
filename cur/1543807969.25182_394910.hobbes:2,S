I strongly disagree with this opinion.  I don't think there's any problem with
Pavel, at least I haven't had any problems in communicating with him.
Moreover, I don't think the role of maintainer must be to actually write the
code.  From my point of view Pavel is in the right place, because I need
someone to tell me if I'm going to do something stupid who knows the kernel
better than I do.
Furthermore, in many cases this is not Pavel who opposes your patches.
As we speak there is a discussion on linux-pm regarding a patch that you
have submitted and I'm sure you are following it.  Please note that Pavel
hasn't spoken yet, but the patch has already been opposed by at least
two people.  Is _this_ a Pavel's fault?  No, it isn't.
Greetings,
Rafael
