At least in .25 mainline current_thread_info() is still using
[re]sp arithmetic.  Also I think the stack backtracers also
rely on suitable alignment of the stack top. So right now it is still 
fundamental. Now that could be all fixed by using segment
register references and might be, but so far that doesn't
seem to be finished yet.
