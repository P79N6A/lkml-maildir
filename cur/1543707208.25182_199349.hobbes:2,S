Any chance to get this warning for 2.6?
What would happen if a symbol filename is changed by replacing
the '-' with '_'?
The module-init-tools wouldn't care. I don't know the internals
of kudzu, but discover2 uses modprobe to load the modules. The
internal workarounds in discover2 for the inconsistency would
become obsolete.
Maybe the alsa stuff? There are many alsa modules with '-'.
Would it be easier to fix the output of /proc/modules than
renaming all modules with '-'?
Of course I would be glad to help.
