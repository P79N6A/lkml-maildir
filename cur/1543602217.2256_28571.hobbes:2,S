But this happens naturally with LRU.  Think how it works: to get evicted a 
page has to progress all the way from the head to the tail of the LRU list.  
Any page that's accessed frequently is going to keep being put back at the 
head of the list, and only infrequently accessed pages will drop off the tail.

OK, that does get at something you can do with aging that you can't do with 
an LRU list: look at the weightings of random pages.  You can't do that with 
the LRU list because there's no efficient way to determine which position a 
page holds in the list.
One application where you would want to know the weightings of random pages 
is defragmentation.  That might become important in the future but we're not 
doing it now.
A little contemplation will probably turn up other uses for this special 
property.
