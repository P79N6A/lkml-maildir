Hi all.
I have download some extra-tools to make my linux box talk to others
servers and machines i have here in my network, like some Net(a)wares
and Mac-in-tosh'es. Grabbed ncpfs-2.0.10 and netatalk-1.42b. None of
them compiles with 2.2.5. Is some other thing i have to do, except await
a new release of this packages? Both give me messages like "In file
included from... (snip) (variable) redefined... (snip) Structure
undefined... (snip)... (variable) undeclarated..." and so on. If i need
some special action to do, please tell me. If i need to put this message
in other places, don't flame me in this list: PVT-me.
Thanks all.
