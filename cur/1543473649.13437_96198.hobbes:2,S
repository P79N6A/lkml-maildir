make xconfig is still broken on Intel.  This part of the patch (to
arch/i386/config.in) causes `make xconfig' to print `Ooops' instead of
generating a useful tk script to run:
+#
+# Define implied options from the CPU selection here
+#
+if [ "$CONFIG_M386" != "n" ]; then
+  define_bool CONFIG_WP_WORKS_OK y
+  define_bool CONFIG_INVLPG y
+  define_bool CONFIG_BSWAP y
+fi
Specifically, it appears to be choking on the "n".
There's a boot-time version number display buglet:
  Swansea University Computer Society NET3.039 for Linux 2.1
That should probably be `2.2'.
Make xconfig has two other glitches that were also in 2.2.0-pre1.  The 
"Mice menu" has some non-mouse options in it -- "Digitizer Pad",
"QIC-O2 tape", "Do you want runtime Configuration for QIC-O2",
"Watchdog Timer".  The "Watchdog Cards" menu has some non-watchdog
items in it -- "/dev/nvram support", "Enhanced RT clock", and "Tadpole 
ANA H8 Support".
Lastly, since 2.1.132 my AWE 64 Gold card is being identified as
`EMU8000' instead of `AWE32'.  It still appears to work, so maybe this 
is only a cosmetic change.
