For the lkml readers, my original post (with patch) didn't seem to go

Yes.

Yes.  But for those drivers that do care, they can get it with the new
usb_if_to_ifnum() function.  This will provide the _correct_ interface
number, the old interface only provided the index, which people seemed
to use as the ifnum.

Yes.

Yes.  dev.driver_data should be wrapped by a function, like
pci_set_drvdata() and pci_get_drvdata() are for.

Yes it should.

Yes, that's the part that I am pretty sure is not working properly right
now, and is next on my list of things to clean up.
