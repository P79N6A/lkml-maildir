Hello list!
I solved the problem and wanted to report what tell you what the problem
was:
- the filessystem support was fine
- init was fine
but....:
I forgot that init was dynamicly linked and there were no libc.so.6 nor
ld-linux.so on my system!
I am afraid that the kernel says there is no init, because there where
an init,
only it had not the libs it needed.
Could we not change the panic message to
"could not execute init correctly (possibly a problem with init or
init's libs)" ?
