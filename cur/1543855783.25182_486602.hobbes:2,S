Usually failslab, as it exposes unique stacks more quickly.

When conducting an expensive test, one would naturally prefer not to
repeat it on cases that are nearly the same, and therefore unlikely to
expose a bug, at least until all the "more distinctive" cases have
been hit.  Which cases actually do contain a bug is of course
not knowable a priori, and "distinctiveness" is subjective.
The claim of this patch is that uniqueness of call stack is 
a better proxy for likelihood to contain a bug than mere number
of calls to should_fail() -- which can be thought of as the null proxy.

Sure.

True.  "space" seems useful only for storage allocation calls.
Should it be dropped from the common set of debugfs entries?
