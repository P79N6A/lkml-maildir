I will.  It's not split up at the moment because I'd like to
work a bit more on -rmap before submitting it for inclusion
and bitkeeper is a really nice tool to help me carry the patch
from version to version.
If -rmap makes it into the kernel I'll work with small patches
in the same style as Andrea, that's just the easiest way to
work.
I'll also take some of rusty's scripts to automatically check
if a patch (1) has been applied to the latest kernel or
(2) if it still applies cleanly.
Basically I'm looking for a way to minimise the work of
carrying the -rmap VM across kernel versions, so I can spend
my time doing development and cleaning up the code further.

Actually some stuff can be modularised somewhat. Christoph
Hellwig for example has a nice patch which replaces all
knowledge of page->wait with wake_up_page().
This makes the fact of whether we're using per-page waitqueues
or hashed waitqueues completely invisible to the rest of the
kernel.
Similar things are possible for other areas of the code.

One thing William Irwin (and others, myself too) have been
looking at is making the pagemap_lru_lock per-zone.
This would allow us to "split up" memory in zones and have
each CPU start the allocation chain at its own zone.
This works out in practice because the reverse mapping code
allows us to scan and free memory by physical address,
meaning that reclaim_page() becomes a per-CPU local thing
under light memory loads.
Of course the current problem with that code is truncate
and the lock ordering between the pagemap_lru_lock and the
page_cache_lock ... something to look at later.
kind regards,
Rik
