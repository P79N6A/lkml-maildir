No, alloc_bootmem_node should work for 4G allocations too; So my approach
should work unless there was some other bootmem request served out of that 
node earlier.  Btw, the default is to allocate 64MB for swiotlb.  
Do you modify that for your boxes?  IMHO, we should stick to fixing the 
stock kernel now for 2.6.14.  
However, IS_LOWPAGES macro in my patch enforces that iotlb start and end 
locations to be within 4G.  I can change that to within and upto 4G, and the 
patch should work for you too.
Thanks,
Kiran
