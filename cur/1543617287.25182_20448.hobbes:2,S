 Now, is that a chipset problem or a firmware (MP table) one?  If the
former, we should code a workaround triggered by the chipset's PCI ID, so
the I/O APIC path works, otherwise vendors should fix their firmware.  For
UP systems a simple possibility is to remove the MP table altogether if
it's too hard to fix -- it is not needed at all.
