Great, now, that this is settled, let's go back to the compare and swap 
issues.
As far as I can tell, we need compare and swap on a single queue 
implementation for rwsems. Again most architectures provide something like
that today. As for those which don't, why not provide either of the following 
approaches
(a) spinlock around the update code in the kernel. We could provide multiple
spinlocks to avoid potential collision.
(b) only provide futex in the kernel and user library approach using 2 queues 
as shown by Rusty. The lack of cmpxchg support would be exported by the  
futex_region call.
