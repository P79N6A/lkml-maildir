That was quick :-).  Backing out the sysctl_check.c diff gives me a
working kernel.  Beats the #$%@! out of me how/why, though.
Michael Cree: could you try backing out the diff below from your
2.6.24-rc3 tree and see if things are now working for you?
Here's "uname -a", just to confirm (maybe) I'm running on what I say

Linux smirkin 2.6.24-rc2-g6f37ac79-dirty #2 Fri Dec 7 08:03:12 CST 2007 alpha
Here's the diff I backed out (patch -R).  It's short...
