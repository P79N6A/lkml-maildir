NO!
We used to do this a LOONG time ago.
Distributing the VM information on how to properly insert a pte into the
page table into drivers is _NOT_ something I want to do again. It was a
pain to get it properly modularized, we're not going back to the horror.
Note that if there really are only 9 "nopage" routines, then it is a lot
easier to just add the single "SetPageUptodate(page)" into those 9
routines, and thus let the VM know of the race.
