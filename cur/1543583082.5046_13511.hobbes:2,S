I think there might be a bogon in __down_interruptible's
handling of the semaphore state in this case.  I remember
spotting something a few months back but I can't immediately
remember what it was :(
I'd suggest you slot a
	sema_init(&port->physport->ieee1284.irq, 1);
into parport_wait_event() prior to adding the timer.  If that
fixes it I'll go back through my patchpile, see if I can
resurrect that grey cell.
