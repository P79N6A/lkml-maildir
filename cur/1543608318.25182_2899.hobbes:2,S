Again, standard procedure for removal of user-visible API:
	* next devel and following stable branch - use of that API is
possible but produces a warning
	* devel branch after that - API removed.
The fact that nobody had even started that with procfs is a separate story.
But no matter what user-visible API changes we start now, the earliest point
when the old stuff can be removed is 2.7.
