Unfortunately, I seem to be experiencing a similar (if not identical)
problem.  It's a bit easier, though less time-consuming, to reproduce in
my case.  It seems that all I need to do is to leave the system idle for
awhile (1-2 hours seems to do it)... I can still switch between VTs (for
awhile, anyway), but anything that needs to write to disk will hang at
that point, with the disk-activity light remaining on indefinately.  The
only escape is the reset/power button.  So far it's happened three
times (in under 24 hours)... the system's been rock-solid with the
entire 2.2.x series up until this point.
