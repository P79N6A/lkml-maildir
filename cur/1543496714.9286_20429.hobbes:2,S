I have a similiar problem with 2.2.[89], 2.2.7 is OK. I get "lost interrupt"
messages during boot in the partition check of my ide drive on the secondary
interface. The system won't boot up:(
Are you using SMP? 
Does the problem exist in 2.2.7 or 2.2.8?
I am using 2.2.[89] SMP compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3 . I suspect it's SMP related,
because some SMP IRQ changes went in 2.2.8. I should really try 2.2.[89] UP to
see whether the problem is there or not, will do that soon...
