(slight tangent)
FWIW I think the i386 CPU selection logic in make config should be
reconsidered in 2.5+...
The alpha presents you with a list of platforms, and allows you to
select a specific one, or a generic option that includes all platforms. 
The current way of doing things on x86 -- essentially selecting a
minimal level of CPU support -- is nice for vendors like Mandrake who
drops support for older CPUs.  But it isn't nice for the case where a
user wants support for their specific processor and no other.  I have a
P-II, why include code that only works on K7 or P-III?  The embedded
people, I think, would find such a change useful too.
The only problem with an alpha-like configuration is that Mandrake
cannot select a minimum CPU level of support anymore... I guess that
could be solved by an "advanced" sub-menu, similar to that which is
found in drivers/video/Config.in, which allows fine-grained Y/N
selections of CPU support.
