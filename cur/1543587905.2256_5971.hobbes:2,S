Hi
I have the same problem, but i think it 's a BX chipset related problem.
I Have a BP6 whit a BX chipset and a htp 366 chipset.
on a single device, hdparm report ~ 18/19 MB/s
with 2 devices on the same chipset (hda/hdc) 
hdparm report ~ 9 MB/s each
with 2 devices not on the same chipset (hda/hdg)
hdparm report ~ 16/17 MB/s
