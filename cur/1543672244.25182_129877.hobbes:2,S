The integrated graphics seemed to be a key too. I test the agpgart
changes I make on a half dozen boxes before asking you to pull them,
and still couldn't reproduce this bug. The only difference was that
I only have boxes without onboard graphics. All of them worked just
fine, and all of them used agp & dri.  Maybe I was hitting the bug,
but the integrated chipsets thrash agpgart a little harder..
