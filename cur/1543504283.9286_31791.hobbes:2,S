I'll second that.  I tend to be most interested in the stack trace of the
offending thread.  Besides, if the thread crashed while it was modifying
global structures that get modified by other threads, it was probably
holding a mutex for those structures while the coredump was being
generated.
I'll send my workaround to Xavier Leroy for inclusion in FAQ.threads,
which currently has some comments about how coredumps don't work with
pthreads.
