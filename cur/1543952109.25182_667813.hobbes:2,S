Sorry, but we have insufficient information here.
Presumably it fixes some build error, but the changelog should tell us (at
least) what that error was, why it occurs and how the patch fixes it.
Often (for bugfixes) I'll go off and find this stuff out from the mailing
list and put together a proper description.  I also need to do this so I
can work out whether the patch is needed in 2.6.25 or -stable.  But I can't
even find any reference to the original problem in the lkml archives.
