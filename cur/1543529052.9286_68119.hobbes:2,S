This morning I thought I'd give 2.3.50 a whirl, and when I went
to compile netfilter, I got an error and the compile stopped.
The error was something about NF_REASON_MIN_RESERVED_FOR_CONNTRACK
and when I looked at the 2.3.50 patch, I see that the definition
of this value has been removed.
Is there a reason?
Tim
