Thanks for the explanation.
Obviously its true as long as you can allocate the skb that big.
I think you won't realistically be able to get 64K in a
linear SKB on a busy system, though, is not that right?
OTOH, having large MTU (e.g. 64K) helps performance a lot since it
reduces receive side processing overhead.
So, if I understand what you are saying correctly,
things do work correctly (just slower for small skb) if NETIF_F_SG is set bug
clear, it seems that all we need to do is drop the following in dev.c:
        /* Fix illegal SG+CSUM combinations. */
        if ((dev->features & NETIF_F_SG) &&
            !(dev->features & NETIF_F_ALL_CSUM)) {
                printk(KERN_NOTICE "%s: Dropping NETIF_F_SG since no checksum feature.\n",
                       dev->name);
                dev->features &= ~NETIF_F_SG;
        }
is that right?
