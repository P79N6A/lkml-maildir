  I have exchanged Email with him explaining why I feel it's highly
desirable on news servers, and I sent him some metrics with and without.
I had the impression he would reconsider the issue in the future. Note
that means "think about it again" rather than any implied change in his
conclusion.
  As long as patches are available I will continue to apply them, but I
certainly think the increased stability would suggest a backport to 2.4
at some time. I'm not totally sure that's now, Ingo is far better
qualified than I to evaluate the overall impact on more typical loads.
