	The SBS Communications group structured their software this way
(w/useless wrappers) to make files portable from one operating system to
another.  Now that this package will be taking a life of its own, the change
you propose makes perfect sense.
Thanks,

o OsMapPhysToVirt
  -> should be ioremap/pci_iomap()
o OsUnMapVirt
  -> iounmap, etc.
o OsAllocateNonPagedMemory/OsMemcpy/OsStall/OsSleep/OsZeroMem
  -> useless wrappers.
o OsAllocateDeviceMemory
  Yuck, virt_to_bus !
  Please read:
  - linux-2.6.x/Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
  - linux-2.6.x/Documentation/DMA-API.txt
  drivers/net/*.c provides a lot of good examples for recent PCI
  devices.
o OsReadPciConfiguration
  Please see pci_resource_{start/len} and friends.
At this point, lnxosl.c will be removable and nobody will regret it.
