One word here: tmpfs.
I use several amounts of RAM as tmpfs. And with that you can
certainly reach the point of swapping sth. out.
But my machine has only 1GB of RAM and I set up only 2GB of swap.
I compile and test many things there directly from the CVS, run
things like the fcgp to produce nearly a GB of PostScript files
and many more fun things.
So if you plan to use tmpfs, better have enough swap available.
Files in tmpfs can also not be removed by the OOM killer. So you
should define your tmpfs limits properly.
