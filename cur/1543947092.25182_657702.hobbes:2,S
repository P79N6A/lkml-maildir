I agree...its a pretty weak benchmark.  BUT, it does pound on dcache_lock and therefore was a good demonstration of the benefits of lower-contention overhead.  Also note we also threw other tests in that PDF if you scroll to the subsequent pages.

Note that the "3%" figure being thrown around was from a single patch within the series.  We are actually getting a net average gain of 443% in dbench.  And note that the number goes *up* when you remove the ticketlocks.  The ticketlocks are there to prevent latency spikes, not improve throughput.
Also take a look at the hackbench numbers which are particularly promising.   We get a net average gain of 493% faster for RT10 based hackbench runs.  The kernel build was only a small gain, but it was all gain nonetheless.  We see similar results for any other workloads we throw at this thing.  I will gladly run any test requested to which I have the ability to run, and I would encourage third party results as well.

We can clean this up, per your suggestions.

Its very subtle to get this concept to work.  The first few weeks, we were getting 90% regressions ;)  Then we had a breakthrough and started to get this thing humming along quite nicely.
