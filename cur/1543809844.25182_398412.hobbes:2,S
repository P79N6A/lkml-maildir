OK smarty pants ... some of us are a bit slower on the uptake.  How
about this then.  It won't solve the target problem, but it will solve
the device put.

[PATCH] add execute_in_process_context() API
We have several points in the SCSI stack (primarily for our device
functions) where we need to guarantee process context, but (given the
place where the last reference was released) we cannot guarantee this.
This API gets around the issue by executing the function directly if
the caller has process context, but scheduling a workqueue to execute
in process context if the caller doesn't have it.
