I tried it with the serial console inactive (not disabled) and file
transfers don't work whether I set IRQ 0 or 4.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong
- I connected to the target via SSH and ran "gkermit -r" then ran
ckermit locally and issued a "send file.txt" command.
Normally I connect to the target with "kermit -c" which gives me a
serial console, then issue a "gkermit -r", then escape to my local
Kermit and issue the send file command.
