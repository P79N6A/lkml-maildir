I realize what the purpose of the global lock is...
How is the asm code in ACPI_ACQUIRE_GLOBAL_LOCK specific to interaction
between OS and SMI?

;-)  Under Windows?  Irrelevant.  Linux uses the hardware totally
differently from Windows.
Under Linux?  You cannot come close to saying CONFIG_ACPI is used by a
large number of users...  I don't think that claim can really be made
yet.

Compare your x86 asm code with the spinlock asm code.  More importantly,
why is a spinlock or other kernel intrinsic avoided in acgcc.h?  It's
much less portable this way.

(1) A working lock interface does not imply that -users- of the lock
interface are correct
(2) Nobody here puts stock in Windows tests, which I'm assuming the WHQL
is.

The difference with ACPI is that vendors can write code that is executed
in the kernel's context (instead of what you can consider the BIOS's
context).  That is a whole new can of worms.

ACPI is so new I do not think this is necessary.  I am reading straight
from the spec, the same thing system implementors will read.
Anyway, for the main point, which you missed:
The global lock is not ONLY for SMM type stuff.  The vendor can use it
in control methods all over the place.  And the vendor can just as
easily screw up it up.  I do not trust a bios vendor to get runtime OS
locking correct...  and that is -totally- different from trusting the
BIOS to provide us with a tiny bit of information.
Look at the Linux boot sequence, which Randy Dunlap documented.  We
collect as much information as is reasonable from BIOS at startup, so we
won't have to talk to it again at runtime.
