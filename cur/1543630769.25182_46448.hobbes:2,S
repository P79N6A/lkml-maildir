No, am not.

I thought you said the toolchain would merge them?
I don't care about the bloat: I care about the compile time exploding
because every file is different in different trees, due to the
filename strings.
It'd be very nice to have a solution to this, and I'll keep sending
patches to Linus until he applies them or says "no do it this way".
Cheers!
Rusty.
