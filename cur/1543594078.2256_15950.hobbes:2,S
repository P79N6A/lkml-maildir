A number of Specbench numbers of Itanium systems is now available.  Itanium
performs relativly bad for the integer numbers compared to the entire
competition but is a true fp killer.  As a developer I hate that compiling
code for Itanium due to the extra complexity of optimization and code
generation is way slower than for others CPUs.  So all in all Itanium is
a two edged sword.
