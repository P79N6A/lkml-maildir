Yes. If we find ourselves having handed out more IOUs than than we
have money, it means we have already run out of memory - and a
non-overcommit system would have started killing processes already.
Overcommit has delayed the problem but not avoided it in this specific
case - in other cases, we could have survived unscathed thanks to
overcommit.
