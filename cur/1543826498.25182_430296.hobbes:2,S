Many notebooks don't allow changing between piix and ahci modes.  My 
notebook detects one piix interface and four ahci ports.  The piix 
interface is connected to the harddisk while one of the ahci ports is 
the hotswap bay.  So, my harddisk suspends and resumes fine but I can't 
use my dvd rom after suspend/resume.
