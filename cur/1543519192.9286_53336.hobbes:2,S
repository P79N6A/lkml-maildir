  Hello,
I have a problem with stock 2.2.13.I have a machine that serves web traffic
at about 10Mbps (as mrtg says),and recently,with the bandwith increase from
5 to 10 Mbit I had interesting problems - after about 14 hours of serving
trafic at about 10Mbit,the machine stopped responding to pings.When it was
rebooted (it's 10K km from me,I couldn't see what has happened) ,it ran
normal,and the logs showed that it accepted ctrl-alt-del and rebooted
normally - i.e. it wasn't hung...I'm beginning to suspect (i'm probably,very
probably wrong) that the NIC driver stops when it oferflows and wraps it's RX/TX 
counters.
Here's the output from dmesg :
