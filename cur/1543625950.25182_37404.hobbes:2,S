I'm curious how you are doing this cleanly in 2.4. There are lots of
places in the kernel that do direct list management on the queue_head.
Are you adding two separate hidden lists and splicing content to the
queue_head?
2.5 has this done much more cleanly (of course I'm very biased). See the
deadline I/O scheduler patch I've posted before, stuff like this can be
done a lot cleaner there. Internal I/O scheduler structures are
completely hidden from drivers.
