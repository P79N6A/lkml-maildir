Ok,... so here's my patch which I request for inclusion:
--- begin of patch ---
--- end of patch ---
(Ahh,.. my first kernel patch,... *lol* )
;-)
Seriously,.. I thought about adding something like:
"Most users of modern computers won't need this, but it is safer to say 
Y here."
But according to you answer I think that you like the way it's at the 
moment. =)
Never mind! But if you think it's ok I could make a (real) patch which 
adds such a text.
Best wishes,
cam.
