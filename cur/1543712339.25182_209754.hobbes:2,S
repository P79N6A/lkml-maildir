What about latency?
What about recently discussed PRD table "limit" of 256 entries?
AFAIR these are the reasons why IDE driver is currently
limiting max request size to 1024K on LBA48 disks.

Most modern PATA disks support LBA48 and IDE driver has been using
large transfers for some time. :-)

large transfers are part of LBA48 spec
