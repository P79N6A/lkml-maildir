Why can't we use something similar to check memory sizes?  I have a thinkpad
770X with 192MB and 2.2.13 only reports 64MB.  If I tell linux that it has
192MB then it will crash - I need to tell it 191MB (or rather, the amount
that the machine displays on boot.
One other wierd thing happens on the TP.  When I suspend the box, and then
unsuspend it, the sound stops working until I unload and reload the cs4232
module.  Actually I've just found out that if I lower the CD volume in
"xmix" then the sound starts to work again.
Cheers
