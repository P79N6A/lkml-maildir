Which is only (or more accurate: at most) true if the kernel module
developers actually work for the company selling the product.
And it is not (necessarily) true if the company selling the product
hires external people or companies for such a job - than it is much
better (and cheaper) if you get the whole source. It takes a lot of time
(both work time and calendar time) to coordinate debugging of 2rd party
closed source modules.
