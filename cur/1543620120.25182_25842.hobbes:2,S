Subject: Fix for duplicate /proc entries

Hello,
 I think that I have found a problem with proc_dir_entry(). It seems to
allow multiple /proc entries to be created with the same name, without
returning a NULL pointer. I asked the folks on #kernelnewbies, and they
said that perhaps this is a feature. In either case, I believe that the
following patch fixes the issue by checking if a proc entry already exists
before creating it. This mirrors the behavior of remove_proc_entry, which
checks for the presense of a proc entry before deleting it.
Thank you
 - Brent
