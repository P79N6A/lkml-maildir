I haven't read it all, but the stuff I looked at looked
all reasonable and indeed cleaned up the 32bit code significantly
(and be neutral on 64bit). Thanks for doing that work.
My suggestion would be to deprecate and then remove es7000 and
numaq too. The es7000 subarch is only for very old es7000 systems (the
newer ones all work with bigsmp) and I expect the user base is very
likely zero or very near it. For NUMAQ it's similar -- there's
apparently one system left at IBM, and I'm sure IBM can find some
replacement. Especially NUMAQ has some ugly ifdefery outside the
subarch code too that would be good to remove. Overall that would
be a good cleanup without impacting the user base really.
Also bigsmp is kind of obsolete too, it could be probably
merged with default with very tiny impact because it's not
all that different.
