Just to add a little noise: My box (msi 694d pro AI motherboard,
revI, i.e. vt82c686a) been a *lot* stabler since I removed the
Live! and dropped back to the onboard soundcard.
The only time it has frozen has been when checking to see if this
also fixed the X-freezes-on-reentry thing (which I know was
silly, since CVS X has had that fixed for some time and the fix
is on the slow path to 4.1).
I used to get a freeze (that is a lock-up where I have to reset
the box, unable to even alt-sysrq my way out) between one and
five times per day, nearly always in X, nearly always with sound,
nearly always using up a lot of (memtested) memory.
'nearly always' means 'at least once not' -- scientific as hell.
If I could put in words the difference between the Live! and the
via, I would. Alas, I can't, so you're stuck with this inane
rant:
    please please please fix it.
