No, I didn't. We're in 2.5.x timeline and doing early testing (esp. with
"exotic" or rarely used features) is IMHO best done at early times. THis
is why I did it. For now, I don't exactly care for pure stability _if_ a
user can easily choose really dangerous code, esp. if it's advised as
experimental, but "you should say yes" in it's help text. This is, I
like to compile with many features to see where it breaks.
Not doing this means to walk through a mines field later, at 2.6.x
times. That is playing minesweeper with some poor end user. No good...

Btw., that patch got merged to Linus and I'm currently running
2.5.73-bk6 with TF and TCQ enabled (in config, but gets somewhat
disabled because of missing hardware of too many drives per channel) on
a laptop and my (quite a bit loaded) mirror box. No problems /
corruption so far:)
