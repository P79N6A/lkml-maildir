It makes the already unfortunate coupling between the security modules
and the core syslog code even worse, by making assumptions about how the
security modules treat different type codes.  If you were to go down
this route, I think you would want to map the type codes to abstract
permissions in the core syslog code and only pass the abstract
permissions to the security modules (so that they no longer see 2, 9,
and 1 separately but as a single permission).  Might be nice to have
actual #define's for the type codes too.
We wouldn't want the SELinux checking changed; we can already run klogd
confined by policy, and decomposition into privileged and unprivileged
components is preferable to privilege bracketing within a single
component.
