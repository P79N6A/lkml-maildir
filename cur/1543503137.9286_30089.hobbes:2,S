There wouldn't be only one extra syscall if the suspend flag is
implemented.  The manager would be like this:
	pid = clone (..., ... | CLONE_SUSPEND, ...);
	if (sched_setparam (pid, ...) != 0
	    || sched_setscheduler (pid, ...) != 0)
	  {
	    ... kill newly created thread and report error ...
	  }
	kill (pid, SIGCONT);
The child does not have to be modified at all, no trampolines and the
only new syscalls is the `kill' call.
