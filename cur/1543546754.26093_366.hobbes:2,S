Nod. I do recall the discussion which led to this. "Don't
you use my headers for anything; they will be dead in a
week." led to the notion of tight versioning of the include/
hierarchy. If I had a say I would split out implementation
details to local or private headers.

Yes, that worked. I had 2.3.13, 2.2.15 seems to ignore
/lib/modules/build/ I also think
/etc/modules.conf:
path[build]=
should work. I have both in, and something made it work.
