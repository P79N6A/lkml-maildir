ah, quite right, i missed that.  that's because the fusion Kconfig
file starts with:
menu "Fusion MPT device support"
config FUSION
	bool
	default n
config FUSION_SPI
	tristate "Fusion MPT ScsiHost drivers for SPI"
	depends on PCI && SCSI   <-- not dependent on FUSION
	select FUSION
	select SCSI_SPI_ATTRS
	...
  for now, then, i'm just going to remove the FUSION menu change from
the upcoming patch and decide what to do about it later.  as i
mentioned, i wanted this first patch to restructure entries that
required nothing more than the obvious rewrite.  upcoming patch ...
uh, upcoming shortly.
