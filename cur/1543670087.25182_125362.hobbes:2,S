Historically, one of the motivations for the /sbin/hotplug
approach was to avoid the costs of running Yet Another Daemon
that's idle almost all the time ... and all it'd do when it
learns about a new device is fork an easily-customized shell
script, which normally loads driver modules and runs device
setup scripts.  (Modprobe does per-driver scripts, which are
no good for per-device actions, and needs a config file.)
Cheaper all around to have the kernel do that; plus, it had
information that was not otherwise available to daemons.
Much easier to adopt and evolve shell scripts, too.
That is, the design center was for medium-weight events that
always involve starting new processes, and which moreover
tend not to run often.  How often do you connect a new USB or
PCI device?  If it takes a full second to react, that's OK;
and Linux is usually faster than that.  (Windows isn't! :)
I'd certainly agree that some hotplug agents need to be
talking with daemons.  But I've always thought of them as
being application-specific ... tell the print server about
a new printer, for example.  And what you need to tell that
server seems unlikely to be what you'd tell something that's
sampling your collection of video or audio streams.
