is this when a 3D screensaver is active?
Probably worth running without the proprietary nvidia driver.... it
also tends to get more people to pay attention :)
In addition to this suspicion; you're the first one to report this oops
since at least a year as shown in
http://www.kerneloops.org/guilty.php?guilty=journal_dirty_data&version=2.6.23-release&start=1540096&end=1572863
so it might well be something weird on your side (like the binary
driver or some heat problem created by having a 3D screensaver)
