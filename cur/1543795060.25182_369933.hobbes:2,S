Ah. But why is this not done through module parameters? That would be 
more consistent with how you specify resources for other drivers.

This could be a bit more questionable. Setting the initial state of 
hardware is better done (IMHO) by reacting to some hotplug event. E.g. 
fedora uses an 'install' line in modprobe.conf to restore mixer state 
for sound cards.
