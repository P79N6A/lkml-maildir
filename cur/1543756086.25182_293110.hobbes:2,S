Except some ia64 platforms don't have one legacy space per host bus like sn2 
does.

Yes, on sn2 each host<->pci bridge has two busses hanging off it, and each of 
them has its own legacy space.  Child bridges under that bus are routed 
according to the child bridge, which may not route legacy accesses.

No ia64 boxes that I know of support cardbus.

Pretty much, yes.

Don't know, Andi probably does.
