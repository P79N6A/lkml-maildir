Hi Nick,
Your patches improve the performance if lots of processes are
accessing the same file at the same time, right?
If so, I think we can introduce multiple radix-trees instead,
which enhance each inode to be able to have two or more radix-trees
in it to avoid the race condition traversing the trees.
Some decision mechanism is needed which radix-tree each page
should be in, how many radix-tree should be prepared.
It seems to be simple and effective.
What do you think?

Thanks,
