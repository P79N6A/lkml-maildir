Subject: [PATCH] Fix booting on some recent G5s
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi !
Some recent G5s have a problem with PCI/HT probing. They crash
(machine check) during the probe of some slot numbers, it seems
to be related to some functions beeing disabled by the firmware
inside the K2 ASIC.
This patch limits the config space accesses to devices that are
present in the OF device-tree. This fixes the problem and shouldn't
"add" any limitation. If you plug a "random" PCI card with no OF
driver, the firmware will still build a node for it with the
default set of properties created from the config space.
Ben.
