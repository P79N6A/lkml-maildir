That particular statement looks OK.  I'd be suspecting the
next line:
    EL3WINDOW(0);
which is a rather sickly macro which does an outw(N, ioaddr), where
ioaddr was passed into the probe function from the PCI layer.
It seems that this is the first IO instruction which the driver
executes, and that's a likely place for it to crash.
My guess would be that something has gone wrong with the PPC
emulation of `outw' to this PCI device's IO space.
What I suggest you do is to add a
	printk("ioaddr=%lx\n", ioaddr);
immediately before that EL3WINDOW statement, then take it up
on the appropriate PPC mailing list.
