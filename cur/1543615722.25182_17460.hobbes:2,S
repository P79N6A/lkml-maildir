*Stop*.
First of all, exporting size of superblock is wrong, since the entire
->read_super() mechanism is going to be replaced with ->get_super(type, ...)
(get_sb_...() becoming commonly used instances of the method).  Moreover,
freeing superblock is very likely to become a method (for quite a few
reasons).
Please, don't turn fs type into a bloody mess.  It's bad enough as it
is; at least don't add the stuff that will go away anyway.
