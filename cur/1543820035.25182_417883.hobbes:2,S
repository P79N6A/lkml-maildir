For the E752x chipsets, if the Dev0:Fun1 is hidden after the BIOS hands
control to the OS, I think the driver should simply honor this and not
un-hide it.
The test is to check if bit 5 of the DEVPRES1 resister is set.  If set
the device is available, otherwise its hidden.  (see section 3.5.41 of
e7520 specification
ftp://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/30300602.pdf
 )

Yes, basically we should consider removing the un-hide code in
e752x_probe1, and handle the case where the dev0:fun1 is left hidden by
the BIOS as an error condition at driver probe time.

You can never predict when a SMI will bubble through the system.  Even
if you handle case where the BIOS re-hides Dev0:Fun1 and not panic how
do you deal with the race between the BIOS SMI based handling and the
driver?  Who will end up reading (and clearing) the error registers
first?  There is no good way to share today.

No, you should return an error from e752x_probe1 if bit5 is cleared
already.  To do anything else you are assuming that you are privileged
to have more knowledge about what the BIOS is doing than you should.
I'll send the patch to e752x_edac.c this weekend.
