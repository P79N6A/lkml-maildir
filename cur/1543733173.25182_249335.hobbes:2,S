Everyone else in the discussions but you seemed to have no plans to
merge them, yet you keep going back to that plan and ignoring the other
opinions.
If you are merging them then something is wrong in the design. The only
things they fundamentally share are knowledge of the current display
layout, and state management for rendering. 
As you say "if BSD isn't even going to use the code". So why are you
trying to make it hard for the BSD side ? They've got a perfectly good
frame buffer layer too and not suprisingly it has the same requirements
for knowledge.
