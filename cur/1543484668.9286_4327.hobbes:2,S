Let me do a translation of what I think everyone is saying here:
* The Linux module interface is designed to minimize overhead.  That
  means raw linkage into the kernel, which means when the kernel
  changes, so does the module interface.
* A stable ABI requires some kind of layering to isolate it from
  changes to the kernel code (otherwise the kernel would be
  effectively barred from any improvements.)
* NT does such layering for everything, which is part of why its
  performance sucks so badly.
* Linux will not do such layering for everything.  However, there is
  no reason why one can't build a layered ABI adapter (effectively an
  ABI to API converter) on top of Linux.  This implies some
  performance cost, but will allow binary modules to work more or less
  indefinitely, barring huge changes to the kernel internals.
* Linus Torvalds has no interest whatsoever in developing such a
  plug-in ABI.  Someone else is welcome to do it.
