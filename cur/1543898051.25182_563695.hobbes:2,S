Configures, builds, boots on first try.  Dell Latitude D820 laptop, T7200 CPU,
x86_64 kernel.  Doesn't break any of the out-of-tree stuff I use.

Odd - just for grins, I checked what 'make oldconfig' did when handed a .config
from 22-rc4-mm2, and it behaved just fine, much to my surprise.
I can't comment on the DMAR issues, my .config didn't include PCI_MSI so I never
got asked about that one by oldconfig.  Maybe if I get brave this afternoon. :)
