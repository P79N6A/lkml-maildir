A little contradiction there.  "There can only be one" versus
"the one whos stack-selector is being used by the CPU"
Of course there can only be one stack _at a time_,
but the stack selector is switched as part of the context
switch - so there is one stack per process.
The same applies to kernel stacks. There can only be
one at a time, but the kernel stack pointer is
updated on task switches so there is one kernel
stack per process too.
