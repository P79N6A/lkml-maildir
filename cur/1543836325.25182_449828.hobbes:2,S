We knock things down to UDMA33 if they are on an unsuitable cable. The
rest of the displayed data looks correct.

So this appears to be a cable confusion. One thing that was fixed in
recent patches was a bug where if the core code decided something was
PATA but the drive setup was in fact SATA it incorrectly clipped to
UDMA33.

I think the needed patch is in 2.6.18-mm, not sure about 2.6.18-rc base.
Jeff Garzik would be able to verify what has it merged.
