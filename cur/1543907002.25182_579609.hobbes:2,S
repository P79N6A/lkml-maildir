This GIT-PULL is for Blackfin new GPIO update, so I including this SPI
driver patches related to GPIO update. You know, there are still some
SPI patches not included in this GIT-PULL because they are not related
to GPIO update.
So next GIT-PULL, I will try to send out anomaly update from you and
Robin.
