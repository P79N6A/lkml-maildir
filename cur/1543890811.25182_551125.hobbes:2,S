Yes, the hierarchy can be flattened completely and global task weights
computed and used to achieve group fairness. The changes aren't to
pick_next_task() but rather to the ->fair_key computations. In fact, I
went a step beyond that.

The step beyond was to show how nice numbers can be done with all that
hierarchical task grouping so they have global effects instead of
effects limited to the scope of the narrowest grouping hierarchy
containing the task. I had actually assumed the weighting and
flattening bits were already in your plans from some other post you
made and was building upon that.
