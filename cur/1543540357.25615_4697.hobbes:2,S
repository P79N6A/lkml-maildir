FYI, Linus sent me the fix below which worked.
================
Dax - to me it looks like the agp code hasn't initialized yet, and that
agp_bridge.version hasn't been set up by the time drm_agp_init calls it.
Might it be as simple as moving the
        DRIVERS-$(CONFIG_AGP) += drivers/char/agp/agp.o
line in the main Makefile one line upwards (ie move it to _before_ the DRM
line).
Please advice if that helps, I don't have the hardware to test..
                Linus
