Hello everybody
Sorry to bother you with such a question, but I have a 
Intel 1.7GHz Celeron processor with ASUS P4S533 motherboard.
The problem I have is that cat /proc/cpuinfo reports that
cache size      : 20 KB
As far as I know, the CPU has 128K L2 cache.
The kernel version installed on my computer is 2.4.18.
I tried using cachesize=128 as a boot parameter, but it did not help.
L2 cache is enabled in BIOS.
Could someone tell me why it is happening, how to fix it and should I
be
worried that the motherboard is defective.
Thank you very much for your kind help
Lazar
