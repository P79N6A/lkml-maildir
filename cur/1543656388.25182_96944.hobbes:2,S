I discovered after sending the above:
Dec 16 15:08:04 keller kernel: ieee1394: sbp2: sbp2util_allocate_request_packet 
- no packets available!
Dec 16 15:08:04 keller kernel: ieee1394: sbp2: sbp2util_allocate_write_request_p
acket failed
Dec 16 15:08:34 keller kernel: ieee1394: sbp2: aborting sbp2 command
These messages correspond with the pauses...  However, the ieee1394 code
has not changed in some time (as in many months).
