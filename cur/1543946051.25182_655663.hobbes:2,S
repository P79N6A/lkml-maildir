Subject: [patch 1/2] x86: define outb_pic and inb_pic to stop using outb_p and inb_p
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The delay between io port accesses to the PIC is now defined using outb_pic
and inb_pic.  This fix provides the next step, using udelay(2) to define the
*PIC specific* timing requirements, rather than on bus-oriented timing, which
is not well calibrated.
Again, the primary reason for fixing this is to use proper delay strategy,
and in particular to fix crashes that can result from using port 80 writes
on machines that have resources on port 80, such as the ENE chips used by Quanta
in latops it designs and sells to, e.g. HP.
