Uh nasty :)

It barfs at a lot of commands, not surprisingly. ide-cd really has no
concept of devices other than cd/dvd.

You need to patch cdrom.c as well:
	if ((fp->f_mode & FMODE_WRITE) && !CDROM_CAN(CDC_DVD_RAM))
		return -EROFS;

I'm tempted to say ide-scsi + sd, but that goes against my principles...
It shouldn't be too much work to make ide-cd work gracefully.
