What kind of abstraction are you thinking about? I can easily extend
the devfsd protocol so an attempt to lookup a non-existent device node
will send a message to devfsd which can then run a script. Once the
script finishes, devfsd wakes up and the lookup() method returns.

Pretty amazing. However, I can't really see the point. If you've got a
daemon at the other end of that pipe, you may as well start it at boot
time and have it create the pipe.
The point of this example is to show that you can do all kinds of cool
stuff if you wanted to.
