This is the "first" IDE controller on my notebook:
./devices/root/pci0/00:07.1/01f0
./devices/root/pci0/00:07.1/01f0/0
./devices/root/pci0/00:07.1/01f0/0/power
./devices/root/pci0/00:07.1/01f0/0/name
./devices/root/pci0/00:07.1/01f0/0/status
./devices/root/pci0/00:07.1/01f0/power
./devices/root/pci0/00:07.1/01f0/name
./devices/root/pci0/00:07.1/01f0/status
Guys I have done it already!
For your convenience I will attach the ata prefix to the
currently used port number in the next patch round.
OK?
