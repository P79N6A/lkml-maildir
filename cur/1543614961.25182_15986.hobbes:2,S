And can anybody explain, why is it so ?
(I mean checking for -1, and the switch(errno){}.)
AFAIK, syscall returns us a number (on i386 it is in eax)
and we can use it. Is errno a kernel thing, or GLIBC ?
Haven't we a return code in eax, after   int 0x80 ?  
(sorry, but I never worked on Linux on other architectures)  
 
Best regards.
