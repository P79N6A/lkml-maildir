Greetings;
I thought maybe I'd exersize this kernel, but a patch I thought was in 
seems not to have been, so I believe this is the 2nd time I've 
encountered this:
  CC      drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_devintf.o
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_devintf.c: In function `ipmi_new_smi':
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_devintf.c:532: warning: passing arg 1 of 
`class_simple_device_add' from incompatible pointer type
drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_devintf.c: In function `ipmi_smi_gone':

which of the 'git' patches fixes this?
