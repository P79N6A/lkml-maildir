Hi,
I'm running 2.4.0-test9 on an Aladdin V based mother board.  The IDE
interface locks up (i.e. reads/writes etc fail, drives cannot be
detected when booting) and only works again after power cycling.  Same
problem occured with 2.4.0-test5 and up.   The problem does not occur with
2.2.x kernels (2.2.14 and 2.2.17 tested) with the 1.0 beta 3 driver.
The primary interface has two UDMA33 drives (both of which are
automatically put into UDMA33 mode).  The secondary interface has a CD-ROM
drive and a Zip disk but neither are used. 
Unfortunatly I have been unable to determine what particular circumstaces
cause the problem as it occurs infrequently (maybe after a few 
hours).  This first signs are the following messages
hda: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hda: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hda: DMA disabled
hdb: DMA disabled
hda: drive not ready for command
ide0: reset timed-out, status=0x80
hda: status timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
...and so on...
The problem appears t only occur if I have not previously booted Windows
98. 
lspci reports the IDE interface as
  Acer Labs M5229 IDE interface (revision c1)
