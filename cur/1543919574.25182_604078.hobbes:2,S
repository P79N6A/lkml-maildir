Subject: [BUGFIX][PATCH][ for -mm] bugfix for memory cgroup controller [1/5] charge refcnt race fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/12/55

The logic of uncharge is 
 - decrement refcnt -> lock page cgroup -> remove page cgroup.
But the logic of charging is
 - lock page cgroup -> increment refcnt -> return.
Then, one charge will be added to a page_cgroup under being removed.
This makes no big trouble (like panic) but one charge is lost.
This patch add a test at charging to verify page_cgroup's refcnt is
greater than 0. If not, unlock and retry.
Changelog v2->v3
 * adjusted to 2.6.23-mm1
Changelog v1->v2:
 * added cpu_relax() before retry.
