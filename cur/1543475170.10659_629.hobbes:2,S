I had a similar problem with one NTFS partition.
The following patch solved it for me:

In super.c:ntfs_init_volume() it reads mft_clusters_per_record from 
offset 0x40. It contained 0xF6. And instead of interpreting it as -10
(there is some special code later on) it took it as +246.
Best regards,
Werner
