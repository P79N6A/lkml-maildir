Check out /proc/acpi - you should find a few things that you can tinker 
with, including one for your screen; often called `lcd'. If you "echo 1 
 > lcd" in the right directory, it should switch it on. "echo 0 > lcd" 
switches it off. Whatever is managing your power that turns it off, 
isn't turning it back on. Look into these. It's not likely to be the 
console/X driver's fault.
