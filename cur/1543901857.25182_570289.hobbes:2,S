It's one of these:
ata4: EH in ADMA mode, notifier 0x0 notifier_error 0x0 gen_ctl 0x1501000
status 0x400 next cpb count 0x0 next cpb idx 0x0

sd 5:0:0:0: [sdb] 156301488 512-byte hardware sectors (80026 MB)
sd 5:0:0:0: [sdb] Write Protect is off

sd 5:0:0:0: [sdb] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't

Essentially the controller has been given a command (a cache flush, 
which for whatever reason seems to cause this frequently) but it doesn't 
give any indication that it has done anything with it (CPB response 
flags remain at 0). There have been a few reports of this, and I'm at a 
loss to explain why it happens. Certainly the publicly known information 
on this controller doesn't seem to give any hints on what if anything we 
could be doing wrong.
A workaround was added in sata_nv a while back that adds a delay between 
  completion of an NCQ command and issuing of a non-NCQ command, or vice 
versa. This seems to have improved things (for unknown reasons), but 
hasn't entirely fixed the problem. If your drive has NCQ support, it may 
be a remaining case of this problem.
I've previously asked for info on this issue from NVIDIA (as well as 
Jeff Garzik who has access to the controller documentation), but haven't 
gotten any info yet. Consider this another ping :-)
