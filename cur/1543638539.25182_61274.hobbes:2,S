Hi there,

Absolutely not.  Many systems have a symlink 'linux' to the current
kernel tree, which is a directory e.g. 'linux-2.2.16'.  If the tarball
extracts into the 'linux' directory it would overwrite the (presumed
working) source.  I'm sure that the use of 'linux' was an oversight.
At least I hope it was.
