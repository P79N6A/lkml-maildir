The almost exact error is:
kernel panic skput:over:0481b97c:243 in swapper task - not syncing
...at this point the machine is completely deadlocked and we're forced to
reboot.
It is a Celeron 300A with 64 megs of RAM, it serves as a dedicated
WWW/SMB/FTP/SQL/SMTP/POP3/IMAP/IPMASQ.
Stock Redhat 5.2 kernel.
This is an Enterprise solution for a very important client, we would
appreciate any help- even the smallest.
Here's some various info on the hardware from Linux:
