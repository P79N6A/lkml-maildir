I have to admit I don't understand much about git, but this monster 
merge somehow worries me:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=210cc679faf0e1cabda9fc5d1279644f5e52aecb
It's commit message says: 'Auto-update from upstream', and it indeed seems 
to contain changes already made to the upstream tree. Would someone please 
explain to me why it shows up in Linus' tree?
Thanks,
Tim
