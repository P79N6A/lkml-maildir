The original issue was the possibility to add support for C++
solely to support an existing implementation of a filesystem.
Not to rewrite the kernel in C++, neither to encourage the use of C++.
And with this in mind the figures above does not matter.
Likewise does neiter of the many arguments in this thread.
Now if the C++ fans could present what is needed to actually support
building a module in C++ instead of arguing.....
