	And unacceptably slow.  With LKM_LOCAL, OCFS2 approaches ext3
speed untarring a kernel tree, because everything under the toplevel
directory is a candidate for LKM_LOCAL.  Network communication may be
fast, but pagecache operations are even faster.  I don't know by how
much, but I bet if we turned off LKM_LOCAL in the OCFS2 DLM, we'd lose a
lot of speed.
