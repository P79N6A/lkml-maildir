Hi!

[Please inline patches, it makes it easier to comment on them.]
You seem to reuse same key/iv for all the blocks. I'm no crypto
expert, but I think that is seriously wrong... You probably should use
block number as a IV or something like that.
Does it slow down swsusp in measurable way, or is it just lost in the
noise?
