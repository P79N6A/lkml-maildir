What about 2.4.0-ac5? That had the same problem as -ac12. Did it also have
the new DMA mapping?

Yes, I'm pretty sure the problem is not only the epic100 driver, now that
I have done some more investigation. With the broken drivers (I tried
2.4.0-ac12 and 2.4.1-ac5), something generates an enourmous amount of
interrupts as soon as I run 'ifconfig eth0 up'. Within 10 seconds, I got
roughly 950000 interrupts on IRQ11, instead of 30!
After disabling the usb-uhci (I was using the JE driver) in the BIOS
setup, the system reproducibly locked up hard a few seconds after
'ifconfig eth0 up' instead of just getting slow.
Unfortunately, I have no way to also disable the sound card, but at least
it does not make a change if the sound driver is loaded or not.

On Monday I can ask the system administrator for the keys so I can open
the machine and put the card into another slot. Right now, USB, sound and
network are hardwired to the same IRQ, that's how the system arrived here.
