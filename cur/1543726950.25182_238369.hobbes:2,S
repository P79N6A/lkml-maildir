I agree with that. Like you and Andrew said, this metric (write block) 
is just an estimate (quite wrong indeed) of what really occurred in the 
system because some writings are accounted elsewhere (pdflush or 
journaling file system).
I also agree that a rough estimation is not very interesting, therefore 
I'm working on another patch to provide accurate values.
Best,
Guillaume
