I'm not really sure what to think of all this patent stuff myself, but
I may need to get some directions from lawyerish types before moving on
here. OTOH I certainly like the suggested approach more than my
conservative one, even though I'm still too chicken to follow it. =)
On a more practical note, though, someone left out an essential 'h'
from my email address. Please adjust the cc: list. =)
Thanks,
Bill
