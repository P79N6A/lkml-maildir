REAL pre-8 (NOT the one from the _testing_ directory) works fine
here. I have de4x5 compiled with egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1
release), in kernel.
I also observed strange problem with CD-ROM (Alan, I don't know if
it's the same one you're talking about).
"eject" stopped working!?!
{atlas} [~]% eject
eject: CDROMEJECT ioctl failed for `/dev/hdc': Operation not supported

readlink("/dev/cdrom", "/dev/hdc", 1024) = 8
open("/dev/hdc", O_RDONLY)              = 3

fstat(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0444, st_size=0, ...}) = 0

ioctl(3, CDROMEJECT, 0x4000b3f0)        = -1 EOPNOTSUPP (Operation not supported)
write(2, "eject: CDROMEJECT ioctl failed f"..., 71eject: CDROMEJECT ioctl failed for `/dev/hdc': Operation not supported
) = 71
_exit(1)                                = ?
It could be a user space problem, after all, but it worked before!
