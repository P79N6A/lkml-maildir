Linus - I haven't tested this patch myself yet, but I do think something
needs to happen with linux/irq.h.  It seems a comment in the file isn't
sufficient.
The file itself is misplaced and misleading sitting in the include/linux
subdirectory, which causes problems when people decide to include it into
architecture independent files, in the belief that it's a generic include
file.
I believe that linux/irq.h should at least become asm-generic/irq.h to
stop this happening.
What are your thoughts on this?
(Unfortunately, bkbits browsing using lynx or links seems to be rather
broken at the moment, otherwise I'd have checked whether you've already
integrated this patch.)
