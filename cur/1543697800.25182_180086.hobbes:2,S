The individual patches in the broken-out/ directory are usually
changelogged.  This one says:
  It was EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(), however IBM's GPFS is not GPL.
  - the GPFS team contributed to the testing and development of
    invaldiate_mmap_range().
  - GPFS was developed under AIX and was ported to Linux, and hence meets
    Linus's "some binary modules are OK" exemption.
  - The export makes sense: clustering filesystems need it for shootdowns to
    ensure cache coherency.
