Well yes. Now you are even resending my *private email to you* to a
public mailing list! That is very very much not done.
A very good resource is RFC 1855, the netiquette standard.
http://www.rfc1855.org/
"- If you are forwarding or re-posting a message you've received, do
   not change the wording.  If the message was a personal message to
   you and you are re-posting to a group, you should ask permission
   first.  You may shorten the message and quote only relevant parts,
   but be sure you give proper attribution."
"- Limit line length to fewer than 65 characters and end a line
   with a carriage return."
In fact, someone else has already posted a complete gzipped copy
of rfc1855.org to this list. Which in itself probably goes against
RFC1855, just like this part of this thread itself, actually.
Which is why I responded to you in private email.
Mike.
