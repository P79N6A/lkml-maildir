    You're assuming that before the GNU C compiler there was nothing but
    a howling void.   This was NOT the case; on the contrary, the wide
    availability of GCC has salted the fields that used to produce free
    C compilers.
    If RMS had been run down by a streetcar in 1983, GCC wouldn't exist,
    but one of the other free C compilers would now dominate the C
    compiler marketplace.
