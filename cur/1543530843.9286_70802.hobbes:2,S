Do you know which standard this is?

That sounds really scary, my worry here is not really whether the NICs
support it, the interesting issue is whether all (or at least the
majority) of the switches, hubs and routers on the market will do
it. The only way to be sure is if the Ethernet standard allows for
this, if there is some proposal to allow this by the 802.1Q people,
but it's not in the original Ethernet standard, then it should
certainly only be an option. The think I don't like is that it will
require that you implement driver specific versions of
dev_change_mtu() for each driver.
