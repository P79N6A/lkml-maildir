Could you please just do me a small favour and drop something
in to linux/Documentation. Becouse I'm right now already confused
about which driver to use and which alias to put in /etc/modules.conf
so kudzu stops hollering about not knowing what to do
if I out of a sudden reboot in to 2.5.xx kernel.
Many thank's in advance.
PS. I could of course figure it out of my self, but since
I don't attach anything to USB on my box *that* frequently.
