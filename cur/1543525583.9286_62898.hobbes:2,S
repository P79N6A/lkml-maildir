German,
Did the following on my machine:
$ getcwd
/usr/src/linux-2.3.44/drivers/scsi
$ grep scsi_init_mallo *.c
$
So there are no references to (or definitions of) scsi_init_malloc() 
in my 2.3.44 tree which I believe to be clean. Eric Y. has said 
he was going to get rid of it and it seems like he has succeeded.
Also scsi_init_malloc is not mentioned in patch-2.3.44 so it
wasn't in 2.3.43 either.
