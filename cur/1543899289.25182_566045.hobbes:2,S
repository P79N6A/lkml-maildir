I don't think we can do that. I suspect rename looks like:
	write directory entry in source
A)	(uninterruptible wait for write)
	write directory entry in destination
	(uninterruptible wait for write)
	write something else
If we freeze some task in place "A)", we'll write to the disk when the
directory write is finished :-(.
