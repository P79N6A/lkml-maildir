I'm afraid we can't deduce the nonexistence of a race from my failure
to search very hard.

Oh yes, we're quite equal on this: I wasn't trying to blacken
your approach, just raising an issue and asking for help.

On that we differ, and always shall, I expect.  Yes, carrying around
the PageSwapCache? &swapper_space stuff does make sync_page look
cleaner, and shrink_list quite a lot easier - I gave up on trying to
eliminate it completely, would uglify shrink_list too much.  But it
is a fiction, and for everywhere else (I think that's correct) it's
just baggage - made sense when you could stuff it in page->mapping
and then forget about it, but a lot less sense if we have to check
PageSwapCache all over (even if that is hidden in an inline function).
