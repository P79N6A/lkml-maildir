Andrew has some work to do before he can regain momentum:
- Which subsystem maintainers will have public git trees?
- Which maintainers will continue to use bk?
- Can Andrew legally use the bk client?
- Can Andrew legally use a bk client which won't go phut at cset 65535?
- How do I do a bk `gcapatch' is there is no Linus bk tree to base it off?
- If none of the above, which maintainers will put up-to-date raw patches
  in places where Andrew can get at them?
I don't know how all this will pan out.  I guess the next -mm won't have
many subsystem trees and I'll gradually add them as things get sorted out.

yup.

I could aggregate a subsystem maintainer's quilt series into -mm of
course.  That would be nicer than a huge rollup for both code reviewing and
for the old bsearch-to-find-the-regression process.
Of course, quilt-based patches can be checked into an SCM and publically
exported.   Lots of people do that.

Yes, it would be nice to have gregkh's patches in -mm as individual patches.
Of course, whatever gets done, I'd selfishly prefer that most (or even all)
subsystem maintainers work the same way and adopt the same work practices.
I guess it's too early to think about that, but if one maintainer (hint)
were to develop and document a good methodology and toolset, others might
quickly follow.
