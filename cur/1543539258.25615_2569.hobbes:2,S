People!
Somebody He-e-e-elp Me!
;-)
I've got some unclear problem with Linux kernel 2.4.0-testxxx :) and UDMA66.
My PC is based on GigaByte GA-BX2000-Plus motherboard with Promise Ultra66
integrated controller onboard.
In brief:
PIII-500Mhz
128Mb RAM
Matrox G400-SH 16Mb
Primary Master:
Samsung SC-148 CDROM
Promise Ultra66 Primary Master:
Fujitsu MPE3084AE  8.4Gb
(W2K installed)
Promise Ultra66 Primary Slave:
Quantum Fireball lct08  8.4Gb
(Linux)
Whatever I do I just have the same phenomenon after kernel compilation and
reboot:
Kernel is loading...
...skipped...
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33Mhz system bus speed for PIO modes; overridewith idebus=xx
PIIX4: IDE Controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: chipset revision 1
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at oxf000-oxf007, BIOS Settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA

    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xe400-0xe407 BIOS Settings: hde: pio, hdf: pio (??? - I
do not understand it at all! And what about DMA???)
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xe408-0xe40f, BIOS Settings: hdg: DMA, hdh: DMA (OK -
Here it is, but I do not have any drive attached here!)
hda: SAMSUNG SC-148B, ATAPI CDROM drive
hde: FUJITSU MPE 3084AE, ATA DISK drive
hdf: QUANTUM FIREBALL lct08 08, ATA DISK drive
    ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6, on irq14
    ide2 at 0xd400-0xd407, 0xd802 on irq11 (Yes, ide2=0xd400,0xd802,11 but
what's wrong?)
...And system is halted.
I tried 2.4.0-test1, 2, 3, 4 without any sufficient difference.
This way I am forced to boot from diskette old 2.2.15
with kernel parameters like "ide2=0xd400,0xd802,11 root=/dev/hdf1"
Does anybody know how to heal it?
Regards,
Mike
