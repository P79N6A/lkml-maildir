Yes, I finally was able to get 2.4.20 to build for me.  Turns out that I
had to massage the build configuration a little bit first.  Reminds me of
a few fernels that wouldn't build *unless* SMP was enabled in the config.
SMP on a single CPU machine?  Yes, I like wasting 400K by putting in a
feature that I won't actually be using.

Ah, the archives.  Would these be the same archives that are both
incomplete, and scattered across three, maybe more, locations?  Kernel
Traffic is the best of the lot, and I had problems searching it.  I do a
simple search for 'modutils' and it spits out 350+K of stuff.  Stuff that
has absolutely nothing to do with the module utilities.
