Stupid question time:
A great deal of text has been expended over the years by people desperately 
trying to make sure you didn't need /proc mounted to have a usable system, 
for some definition of usable.  Now with rootfs, initramfs, sysfs, and the 
libfs inspired "make a filesystem rather than an ioctl" policy, the main 
argument against requiring the use of /proc is that it has a lot more gunk in 
it (left over from the days when it was the only ramfs type system to export 
values in) than anyone is comfortable with.  (The argument against /dev/pty 
largely seems to be inertia, now that the "number of ptys" issue as a config 
tunable seems to have been cleared up).
There seems to be some sort of nebulous plan for eventually stripping down 
/proc, perhaps making a "crapfs" that's a union mount on top of /proc 
providing deprecated legacy support for a release or two.  But I haven't 
heard it explicitly stated.
So my questions are:
1) will some subset of /proc, /sys, /dev/pty, etc become required at some 
point in the future on everything but the most customized embedded systems?  
Or is keeping the system usable without them still a goal?
2) Is there a plan to rehabilitate /proc?
(I ask because I don't know.  Maybe I missed some important posts...)
