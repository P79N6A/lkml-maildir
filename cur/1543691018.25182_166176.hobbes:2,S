The kernel is cool, but it is a large piece of code with a lot of ideas
in it that some folks find challenging (interrupts, multiprocessing,
threads and locking) [One thing to be said at least the Java taught
university folks understand some of this unlike those they used to feed
pascal]
Have fun but if you find the kernel daunting and hard work, don't give
up but pick up something smaller, easier to understand and use a
debugger on - like desktop applications, then come back and try the
kernel again later.
