No,  it doesn't do  that.  I  press PrintScreen  (without Alt)  and it
tells the input system that it is a KEY_SYSRQ.

It's a simple SysRq (0x54), not Alt-SysRq (0x38 0x54) in my notebook.

I know this part of the history, and hence why PrintScreen is emulated
by Alt-KPAsterisk.
    Vojtech> The kernel works with real keys. There is no real sysrq

On my notebook, there IS a  real SysRq.  (The [Fn] part is not visible
to the kernel.  So, that's irrelevant.)

Deprecate the old one.

On  some keyboards  (e.g.  my notebook),  they're  separate.  Is  that
enough a reason to have 2 different keycodes, then?
