	Hi;
	Im pretty sure this is broken, but I dont know exactly
what it is trying to do.
	The first snprintf is overwritten regardless-- missing
else block? And its format string should probably be "%4X:%4X",
because whats there wont fit in the buffer.
	Then the first 3 chars in the string are filled in
with raw numbers (For my card, non-ascii) and then a single
decimal digit?? (This string is printed out during boot time--
which is how I noticed it because of the 'garbage' chars.)
	I dont know what a PnP string is supposed to look like...
