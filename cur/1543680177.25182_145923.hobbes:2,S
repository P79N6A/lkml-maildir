This is exactly my point. It seems that all I'm earing here is that the OS
cannot do the right thing alone. I'm asking you why other apps/OS/kernels
can make it work just fine ? And I am not running RealPlay as superuser.

If a big buffer is for example 32kb, this will give you about 350ms of
sustainable CPU blackout. That is pretty much difficult to hit. Having a
blackout of more than 300-400ms means that either the load is not
realistic or that the timeslice policy has to be tuned. Has anyone tried
to lower the maximum timeslice and to assign it in an exponential fashion ?
Example, maximum timeslice = 100-120ms with :

In a scheduling model that is timeslice driven, two factors influence the
maximum CPU blackout time. One is the number of TASK_RUNNING tasks and the
other one is the timeslice avg length. Interactivity is ruled by the
ratio between the lo-priority timeslice and the hi-priority one. If we
lower the maximum timeslice and we assign it in an exponential way, we can
lower the avg timeslice by keeping "almost" intact the ratio (interactivity).
In this way you basically maintain timeslice ratios (interactivity) while
lowering the cycle time it takes to the scheduler to exhaust the active
array. And this time is basically our maximum blackout time.

Again, while I see one application that survives skips, this makes me
think that other apps do not have the correct timing code.

That's not fiddling. It is tuning your app so that it won't require
realtime when it is not needed. This is design in my books.
