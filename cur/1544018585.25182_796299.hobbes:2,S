Subject: [PATCH tip][0/2] ftrace interface for blktrace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Jens,
	Here is a third version, that also implements blk_add_trace_msg,
using ftrace_vprintk.
	As soon as the TRACE_ITER_CONTEXT_INFO option is implemented
I'll provide the struct trace_event->bin() callback to synthesize the
old blktrace record format so that we can test the output of trace_pipe
with blkparse -i -.
	Please let me know if this is acceptable for inclusion on
linux-tip.
Best Regards,
- Arnaldo
