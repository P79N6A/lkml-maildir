Either of these really is wrong... it's the userspace which should ask 
for what should be imported; the kernel shouldn't hard-code which libcs 
want what.
I just posted a patch to the netdev list which splits the top of 
<linux/socket.h> out into <linux/sockaddr.h>, userspace can choose to 
include one or the other.
