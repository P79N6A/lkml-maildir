Times have changed. Seems Linux folk is now talking about NDAs without 
any flame. Note that I don't care at all and I haven't ever signed any 
NDA.
I just was thinking about what a port of an O/S requires and how much
knowledge is necessary to really understand the arch dependant code and
drivers in order to provide a good port rather that some bag of hacks for
such a project.
I am interested in having some information on caching stuff and IO stuff 
of the IA-64, but didn't succeed find such general infos. I just found 
some presentation of the chip at Intel Web site and, btw, found some 
comparable infos at Compaq site that say that the Alpha 264 is overall 
better and faster than the Merced.
If you have some public URLs that contain relevant general informations
on the IA-64 and Merced, you may want let (us) me know. Thanks in advance. 
Regards,
   Gérard.
