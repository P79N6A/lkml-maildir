The signal subsystem is similar to the "no-op" subsystem in that
neither of them actually need any state - in principle, it could be
useful to attach a signal subsys to multiple mounted hierarchies, to
provide signal semantics for each of them.
Would it make sense to allow a class of subsystem that explicitly has
no state (or at least, has no state that has a global meaning on the
machine), so that it can be multiply-mounted?
