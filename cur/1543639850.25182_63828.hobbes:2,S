Hmmm, It appears that now we need a gendisk per disk, rather 
than per controller, as this snippet from patch-2.5.30 implies?
And we need to set the gendisk's first_minor to be the minor 
number of the first partition for each disk, is that about right?
-       hd_gendisk.nr_real = NR_HD;
-
-       for(drive=0; drive < NR_HD; drive++)
-               register_disk(&hd_gendisk, mk_kdev(MAJOR_NR,drive<<6), 1<<6,
+       for(drive=0; drive < NR_HD; drive++) {
+               hd_gendisk[i].nr_real = 1;
+               add_gendisk(hd_gendisk + drive);
+               register_disk(hd_gendisk + drive,
+                       mk_kdev(MAJOR_NR,drive<<6), 1<<6,
                        &hd_fops, hd_info[drive].head * hd_info[drive].sect *
                        hd_info[drive].cyl)
I think this is why cciss is broken, we have just one gendisk
per controller.  (please pardon my ignorance, I haven't ever 
had to look at this partition related code before.)
