The patches that are going around in this thread (stuff from Andrew
Morton and Andrea) should address some of the ReiserFS issues.  Have you
tried them?
Note that many of the patches will _not_ improve recorded latency,
because anytime current->need_resched is unset, the spinlocks will not
be unlocked and thus preemption will not be enabled.  The patches only
measure the time premption is not enabled.
Of course, true latency will decrease, so see if your `hiccups'
decrease.
Perhaps if we start putting in some conditional schedules like this, I
can write a macro to use the instrumentation stuff to report the shorter
latencies.

Its really just as easy if not easier to lookup the file and line number
that /proc/latencytimes reports.

No, thank you for it.
