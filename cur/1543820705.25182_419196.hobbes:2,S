Thanks, that boots. Of course, since I've only seen the RAID-5 hang bug
once ever, I've got no idea whether it actually fixes it, but I guess that if
the machine is stable for a week or so, it actually fixes my kswapd problem
too :-)
Oddly enough, I've seen other oopses on 2.6 with amd64 and software RAID
(

) involving
invalidate_mapping_page somehow. I wonder if there's a trend here somewhere
or if I'm just into conspiracy theories...
