 Chris, I don't think I understand your definition of `maintenance' - one
of my boxes sometimes gets rebooted more often than weekly, but only if
I'm testing new pre-patches or new -ac patches, or if I'm testing a full 
system rebuild. Your kit doesn't sound *bleeding_edge*, I'd expect it to
keep running for weeks or months.
 Having said that, I've never upgraded a bios in my life, and I'd get
worried to get these messages afterwards. Why did you already suspect
memory corruption ?

 Never tried this version, but I was having a lot of problems 18 months
ago, and again more recently when a fan started to fail. At those times
memtest86 detected no problems. If you want to provoke sig 11, the best 
options are running jade (make htmldocs or whatever you prefer), building 
the kernel, and (best/worst test) building gcc.

 Have you considered the usual problems (poor cooling, inadequate power
supply) ? - I know you're using Intel cpus, but even they need cooling and
power. Do you get reliable readings from lm_sensors ?
