I believe this whole thing is fundamentally flawed.  The perfect
readahead size depends on the device in question.  If we set a single
system-wide value depending on memory size, it may easily be too small
and too large at the same time.  Think hard disk and SSD.
It may make sense to have a _maximum_ readahead size which depends on
memory size.  But the preferred size (if there is enough RAM) should
depend solely on the device, possibly as a function of the
bandwidth * read latency product.
