   As I indicated to Adam, there's a fairly limited range of devices
   available for these systems and there shouldn't be a huge problem
   converting the few drivers we need to these interfaces.
Ok, so to reiterate my other email, I'm fine with this as long as
suitable names are used to describe what is happening in the API
and to avoid confusion with existing practice.
