When exactly is this needed?  The securityfs mountpoint will be available 
via a core_initcall, after which we can initialize the selinux subtree.

With securityfs, we'd have /sys/kernel/security/selinux configured during 
kernel initialization.

Could be a simple change to look for the presence of
/sys/kernel/security/selinux

I think it should reduce and simplify the SELinux kernel code, with less
filesystems in the kernel, consolidating several potential projects into
the same security filesystem.
