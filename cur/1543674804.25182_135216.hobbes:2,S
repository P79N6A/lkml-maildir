Good. Let's do that...

Permission provides a pretty major source of optimization as far as
NFS is concerned: we can ignore it for all operations *except* open(),
and cached lookup().

Is this really desirable? It makes maintenance easy when you are
making add-on patches for the kernel, but IMHO it otherwise just makes
for a confusing interface.

All those are good as far as I'm concerned.

That's no longer in 2.5.x. Do you perhaps mean the new getattr()?

setattr() may help for NFSv4 where we can do open(O_TRUNC) atomically
on the server, and could optimize away the truncation.
The other ops aren't really prime candidates for optimization,
although we could possibly plonk the lookup+op into a single RPC call
by means of the COMPOUND call (again NFSv4 only).

Hmmm...

We could mitigate the effects by making the nameidata field an
optional one. Of course, that would make it harder to add support for
credentials.

Swapping will fail to offend any deeply held religious beliefs of
mine. No problems there...
     > We do all methods.
Yep. As you can see I've looked only at those methods that are known
to have the largest impact w.r.t. the NFS client.
