Hi,
In the i386 kernel (from 2.3.11), CR4 value is saved into the variable
mmu_cr4_features, which will be restored to CR4 in some case.  But the
variable is not exported.
In the CR4 register, there is a flag that enables reading performance
counters using RDPMC instruction in user mode.
I strongly hope to add "mmu_cr4_features" to exported list to make
this bit on/of from a kernel module.
