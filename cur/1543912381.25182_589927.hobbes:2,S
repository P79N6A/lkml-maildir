Subject: [KJ][patch 0/3] use abs() from kernel.h where appropriate
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This small series of quite trivial patches converts a own definition
of the abs macro to the one from kernel.h and replaces some inline
calculations of abs with the macro.
