It's not the merging that I worry about. It's latency and starvation.
Think of it this way: if you keep feeding a disk requests, and the disk 
always tries to do the closest one (which is a likely algorithm), you can 
easily have a situation where the disk _never_ actually schedules a 
request that is at one "end" of the platter. 
Think of all the fairness issues we've had in the elevator code, and 
realize that the low-level disk probably implements _none_ of those 
fairness algorithms.

Hmm.. Where does it keep track of request latency for requests that have 
been removed from the queue?
