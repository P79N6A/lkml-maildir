Well that's nice and simple.  Could you please run `vmstat 1' during that
big `dd'?  Wait for everything to achieve steady state, send us twenty
lines of the vmstat trace?

Greater than 90% I/O wait is to be expected in these tests.  What is of
interest is the overall bandwidth.  2.5 megabytes per second is very
broken.  I have a 53c1030 box here which uses the MPT fusion driver and it
happily does 50MB/sec to a single disk, but I guess that's a different
setup.
