It is clear what happens. Both kernels see different partition tables.
You did not show the 2.4 boot messages, but no doubt they will mention
something about the boot manager shift.
Give 2.6 the appropriate boot parameter and all will be fine.
What parameter? Quoting from ide.c:
 * "hdx=remap63"        : add 63 to all sector numbers (for OnTrack DM)
 * "hdx=remap"          : remap 0->1 (for EZDrive)
So if you have OnTrack you need "hdc=remap63".
