Your concerns are valid, and are relevant for _any_ scheduler design. 
However none of these occur with staircase. Ingo is describing a special 
case where it runs for more than 1ms and less than 10ms. Most things do 
not run exactly in this manner, which is why you haven't seen it, and 
neither have I till I created his test case.
As for the multiuser machine, this is actually an area where staircase 
_excels_ at when put into non-interactive mode. The fact that 
interactivity is not as good in interactive mode under load in a single 
desktop mode doesn't really describe that interactivity is still 
remarkably good considering how strict the cpu distribution is - and 
that's by design. I have now a couple of users using staircase in 
non-interactive mode sharing resources between up to 10 users happily, 
where previously the mainline 2.6 kernel was unable to do this in a fair 
manner.

Great.
