This came from commit a87d091434ed2a34d647979ab12084139ee1fe41 ("x86,
sched: enable wchan config menu item on 64-bit").  We have had
CONFIG_SCHED_NO_NO_OMIT_FRAME_POINTER for some time on various
architectures, this commit just made it available on x86_64 (by changing
its dependency from X86_32 to X86).
