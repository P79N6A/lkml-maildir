Ok, but if the allocator somehow manages to stripe between two swap
devices, what happens?
IIRC original code was something like .1% overhead (8bytes per 4K, or
something?), bitmaps should be even better. If it is 1% in worst case,
that's probably okay, but it would be bad if it had overhead bigger
than 10times original code (worst case).
