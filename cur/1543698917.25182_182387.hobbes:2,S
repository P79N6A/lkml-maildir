I just managed to get it into the same state with NUMA disabled:
 Cpu0 :   0.3% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,  99.7% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu1 : 100.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,   0.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu2 :   0.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice, 100.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu3 : 100.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,   0.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu4 : 100.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,   0.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu5 : 100.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice,   0.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu6 :   0.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice, 100.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
 Cpu7 :   0.0% user,   0.0% system,   0.0% nice, 100.0% idle,   0.0% IO-wait
