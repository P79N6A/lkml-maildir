Dump/restore are useful, on-line dump is silly.  I am personally amazed
that on-line, mounted dump was -ever- supported.  I guess it would work
if mounted ro...
dump is still the canonical solution, IMHO, for saving and restoring
filesystem metadata OFFLINE.  tar/cpio can be taught to do stuff like
security ACLs and EAs and such, but such code and formats are not yet
standardized, and they do not approach dump when it comes to taking an
accurate snapshot of the filesystem.
