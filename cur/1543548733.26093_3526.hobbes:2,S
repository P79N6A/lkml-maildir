Hi,
I just installed succesfully the RedHat 6.2 in a 1000Mhz AMD server.
After I reboot, being finished the installation, the kernel starts and
crashes in
the following panic:
disabling CPUID serial number general protection fault: 0000
(...reg dump...)
Kernel panic: attempted to kill the idle task!
Any clue about this?
Thanks in advance.
