So, if the result is that 
	myfile:resource
is the resource fork for
	myfile
where that last one is the same as 
	myfile:data
then, I'm perfectly happy. 
However, when 
	myfile
starts to refer both to a file and a directory, that's when I get
upset.
Because applications that are used to working on an HFS partition
WILL NOT be able to access 
	myfile 
and 
	myfile/resource
when someone wants to test-drive this application on an ext2fs.
E.g. not knowing yet wether to convert a filesystem to HFS for running
this fanyc apple-emulator.
