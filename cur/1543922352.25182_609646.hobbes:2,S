One minor difficulty:  PCI has a limit on the number of BARs,
but other busses don't.  It'd be better as a "struct resource *".

Wouldn't it be nicer to have PCI use those dev_*() calls?
Ideally pci_request_region() wraps dev_request_region()...

Another minor nit:  addressing the various resource types.
The platform bus code has multiple lookup schemes. 
Calls like resource_iomap() might be more flexible, so that
lookup schemes can stay flexible.
