Good question.
Can't tell. So far this is ahci specific as the ahci requires the DMA
addresses to be written in some register. One would have to look up the
individual specs to check whether this is also true for other drivers.
AFAICS the SATA spec doesn't require you to implement it this way, though.
Cheers,
Hannes
