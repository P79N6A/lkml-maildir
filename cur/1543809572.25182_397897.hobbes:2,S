try to avoid this!
It is very useful for EVERYONE to only have ONE interface to report such
temperatures. That way *all* applications will just work, and nobody
needs to do 5 to 50 different interfaces in their application.
Please try to see if it's possible to use the existing userspace
interface. Pretty please with sugar on top ;)
