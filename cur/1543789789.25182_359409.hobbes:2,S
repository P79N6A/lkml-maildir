Maybe I can test it tomorrow. But as the posted patch work as-is, cannot 
do any harm because it just makes sure the register is set as it should 
be, and we are talking about a not-so-often called slowpath, I think it 
should just be merged and get forgotten, without making a big hassle 
making around it :)
On the other side, as this bug is a little annoyment, it can be tested 
in -mm until 2.6.15 or so. I have the cure now, so I'm happy with it :)
