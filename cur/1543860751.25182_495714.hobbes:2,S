False:
2.6.0 - 2.6.19:  libata guarantees that all PCI BARs are reserved to the 
libata driver.
2.6.20:  no guarantee that all PCI BARs are reserved to libata driver. 
Real-life ata_piix example already provided, where a PCI BAR is no 
longer reserved to the driver.
2.6.21 - infinity:  libata guarantees that all PCI BARs are reserved to 
the driver.
