Slowpath meaning VM slowpath or lock slow path? Its seems that the rwsem 
read side path is pretty efficient:
static inline void __down_read(struct rw_semaphore *sem)
{
        __asm__ __volatile__(
                "# beginning down_read\n\t"
LOCK_PREFIX     "  incl      (%%eax)\n\t" /* adds 0x00000001, returns the old value */
                "  jns        1f\n"
                "  call call_rwsem_down_read_failed\n"
                "1:\n\t"
                "# ending down_read\n\t"
                : "+m" (sem->count)
                : "a" (sem)
                : "memory", "cc");
}

Not sure what you are saying here. A pagefault should be considered as a 
fast path and swapping is not performance critical?

Ok too many calls to schedule() because the slow path (of the semaphore)

But that is only happening for the contended case. Certainly a spinlock is 
better for 2p system but the more processors content for the lock (and 
the longer the hold off is, typical for the processors with 4p or 8p or 
more) the better a semaphore will work.
