The desktop/server user base is quite conservative so that will take a long 
time, but gradually probably.

What advantage would that have over the current setup?
We already should handle holes between nodes reasonably efficiently
and with nonlinear memory even holes inside nodes shouldn't be a problem.

If the great merged architecture ever happens this would be needed anyways.
Just basic 32bit support isn't too difficult anyways -- the problem 
are more the old bugs.
