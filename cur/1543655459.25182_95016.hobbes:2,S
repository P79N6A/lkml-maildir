SYSCALL is AMD.  SYSENTER is Intel, and is likely to be significantly
faster.  Unfortunately SYSENTER is also extremely braindamaged, in
that it destroys *both* the EIP and the ESP beyond recovery, and
because it's allowed in V86 and 16-bit modes (where it will cause
permanent data loss) which means that it needs to be able to be turned
off for things like DOSEMU and WINE to work correctly.
