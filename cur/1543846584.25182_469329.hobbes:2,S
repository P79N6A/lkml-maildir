Subject: [PATCH] Generic platform device IDE driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently the platforms that have very simplistic needs for IDE devices
are forced to invent their own driver for adding the built-in devices.
At the moment ARM is the in-tree user in this category, h8300 could be
switched to something more generic, and SH is roughly in the same
category as ARM.
The only constant that really tends to change between these platforms
are the I/O base and the IRQ, with everything else rather constant. The
ctl base could also change, but everyone seems to keep it at 0x206, so
it's debatable whether it's worth leaving this configurable or not.
I've hacked together a quick driver, 'ide-platform' (for lack of a
better name), that allows for these specifics to be passed in via
platform device resources (registering a device per-port) rather than
having to add more of these things to drivers/ide.
With this we can remove ide_arm (and the h8300 driver can likely be
reworked to use this too), and I don't have to invent a new driver for
SH that does effectively the same thing.
This is intended purely for the simple NO_DMA ide_generic case.. nothing
complicated.
What do people think about this, is there a better way to do this?

    ide: Simple platform device IDE driver.
    
    This adds a trivial platform device IDE driver. Users are required to
    register a couple of resources:
    
    	- I/O Base
    	- CTL Base
    	- IRQ
