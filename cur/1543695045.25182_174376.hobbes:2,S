Yeah, these are just churning out...  This release is done in advance of
a talk about it for the CGL meeting tomorrow at OSDL.
I've released the 005 version of udev.  It can be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-005.tar.gz
rpms are available at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-005-1.i386.rpm
with the source rpm at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-005-1.src.rpm
udev is a implementation of devfs in userspace using sysfs and
/sbin/hotplug.  It requires a 2.6 kernel to run.
The major changes since the 004 release are:
	- klibc is now included in the udev tarball.  If you want to
	  build udev with klibc, please see the README file for how to
	  do this.
	- LABEL for the device symlink now works again
	- if the 'dev' file is not present (like the device was yanked
	  out before udev started looking at it), udev will now timeout
	  properly.
	- the namedev.permission and namedev.config files are renamed to
	  udev.permission and udev.config.  Make sure to realize this if
	  you have customized your rules in the past.
	- man file updates
The biggest stuff is the klibc integration.  If you build with klibc,
the 453K binary shrinks to 45K.  Nothing like a power of ten decrease :)
The rpms are still built with debugging enabled, using glibc, so they do
not get any size savings yet...
Again, many thanks to Dan Stekloff, Kay Sievers, and Robert Love for
their help with patches for this release.  I really appreciate it.
The full ChangeLog can be found below.
The udev FAQ can be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
Development of udev is done in a BitKeeper tree available at:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/udev/
I have the initial framework of some regression tests in the bk tree,
but there is a libsysfs bug that is keeping these tests from working
properly right now.  The libsysfs people are working on fixing this.
If anyone ever wants a snapshot of the current tree, due to not using
BitKeeper, or other reasons, is always available at any time by asking.
thanks,
greg k-h
