Why? We can just stay with the GPLv2 forever.

The "or later" clause is not part of the actual license. It's part of
the preamble.

As things are now we'd already need acceptance from all major
copyright holders to switch license away from GPLv2...

I don't see the point. RMS can create GPLv3 any way he wants, the
Linux kernel will still be under GPLv2 terms... GPLv3 really doesn't
change anything for the kernel. It would only change something if we
switched the kernel to GPLv3, but doing that would probably be next to
impossible anyway since all copyright holders would need to agree on
the switch and; a) some copyright holders have already publicly stated
that they will not agree to GPLv3 terms, and b) some of the copyright
holders are dead.
