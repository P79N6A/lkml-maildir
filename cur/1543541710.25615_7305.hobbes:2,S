But stat myfile#utar _does_ exist, and is a directory. Program could
get confused because myfile#utar does not appear on directory listing,
that's about it. I added magicall files that do not appear on
directory listings, but are there for every other operation. This sees
to have done very little breakage.

This is not hack. Imagine file that is both tarred and gzipped. Now, I
can look at its uncompressed but still tarred version:
cat file.tgz#ugz
or I can look at it as a directory
ls file.tgz#utar.
Okay, this is not what you asked for (resource forks), but I believe
it is even more usefull.
