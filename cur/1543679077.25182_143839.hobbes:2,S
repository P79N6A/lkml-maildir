Hi,
	I am new to Linux Kernel. I am experimenting with Device Driver in Kernel
version 2.4. Is there a method by which the device driver could be indicated
by the
kernel of the termination of a "user process" asynchronously.
I know of the function find_task_by_pid that the driver could call to get
the task
structure given the pid.
Thanks in Advance
Srini
