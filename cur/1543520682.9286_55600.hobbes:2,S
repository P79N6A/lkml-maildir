Since 2.3.29 up to 2.3.35, netscape (4.7) has been dumping core with
signal 7 when exitting. It indeed issues the message 'Bus error' under
2.2.13 but dosen't dump core nor the kernels prior to 2.3.28 (at least
2.3.20, 2.3.25, 2.3.27 and 2.3.28).
Is this due to some changes in the kernels post 2.3.29 ?
