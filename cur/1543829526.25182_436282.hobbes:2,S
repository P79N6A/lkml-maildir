Hi,
I'm seeing a spinlock held panic with a kernel stack like this:
spinlock - panic, lock already held
..
__do_softirq
do_softirq
=========
do_IRQ
common_interrupt
spinlock/spinunlock
..
when I load up the system in testing.
The code protected by the spinlock is quite small - counter increment.
I'm using 2.6.11-1.1369_FC4 #1, installed inside of vmware,
running as a guest on a Windows XP box.
Is this
(a) linux allowing the IRQ too early
(b) vmware not doing something right
(c) enivitable
(d) somehow my fault
(e) something else?
Thanks,
Darren
