No! You test for the return value of the assignment which is the assigned
value, no an indication whether the assignment was successful or not. (How
could it be unsuccessful, BTW?)
Or is C that different from C++ ???
What you probably mean is that 
 if (<expression having a int or a pointer as result>)
is not defined.
I don't if it this, but hundreds of
 if (err)        statements would be wrong and should be recoded to
 if (err != 0)
