I've just got another one InnoDB crash with 2.6.0-test4.
As in previous case there was no messages in kernel log.
You can find mysql error log here.
http://sysadminday.org.ru/linux-2.6.0-test4_InnoDB_crash
It's a development server, so this isn't a big problem.
I do understand that this can easily be a hardware problem,
but the kernel silence is really sad in such case.
Memory is fine (at least according to memtest 3.0).
Any hints will be appreciated.
