The following shell-script shows that gcc-2.8.1 produces code with
data allocations adjacent. However, they are reversed!
cat - <<EOF >x.c
int a, b;
EOF
gcc -c -o x.o x.c
cat - <<EOF >y.c
extern int a;
extern int b;
int main() {
printf("a=%p\n", &a);
printf("b=%p\n", &b);
return 0;
}
EOF
gcc -o y y.c x.o
./y
a=0x804a42c
b=0x804a428
The output shows variable 'a' as being in the higher address.
So, it's not good to assume anything about so-called adjacent
variables.
Cheers,
