Thats the To: line of this message Russell, as it came in here.  I 
assume it was originally filled in to be to me and that you cleaned 
that to prevent your getting a bounce from verizon?
And no, it hasn't bounced yet as it typically will lay in the queue 
somewhere in lala land for anywhere from 4 hours to 6 or 7 days.  By 
that time the friggin message is no longer germain to the 
conversation, so they get deleted here.
