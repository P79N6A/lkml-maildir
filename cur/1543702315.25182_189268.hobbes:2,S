In Linux 2.6.x, you load modules with names like 'dmfe.ko'.
And be sure to use module-init-tools, not modutils.
The module-init-tools location is listed in the Documentation/Changes
file.

Are you building the module for 2.6.x in the norm(al) way
or using some homebrew commands or script?

of course ;)
