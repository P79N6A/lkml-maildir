Subject: Possible memory detection problem on 2.2.14

Hello:
I upgraded to 2.2.14 and the kernel doesn't find all my memory anymore.  
I have 128M on an Abit BX6r2 motherboard using the latest BIOS (bxrnw).  
The BIOS reports the full 128M, but Linux only finds 64M.  If I pass the
kernel "mem=128M" it gets all my RAM though.  My kernel config is
attached.  Everything was fine on 2.2.13, and other boxes I have on 2.2.14
all the memory is found (also 128M machines, different motherboards
though).
