Maybe renaming ATTR_MODE to ATTR_MODE_SET (changing it's value as
well, so that binary stuff breaks visibly as well)?
This would make sense, because we are changing what this attribute
acually means.  In the new code attr->ia_mode only contains the
originally set mode, not the ones we've added to change the suid bits.
