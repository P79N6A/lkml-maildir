Miles,
I read you experiment the same pb, as it makes me lost my previous day ;-(.
As far as I can investigate, it came from a pb with 'make mrproper' which (i
don't know yet when/how) rm a char dev namely /dev/null which is then replaced
by a ordinary file?
Anyway you have to 'rm /dev/null' and recreate the char dev:
e.g. with a debian install
# cd /dev
# ./MAKEDEV null
