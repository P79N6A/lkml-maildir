    Sigh...   And what, pray tell, do we do with these numbers?  That's
    right, at some point(s) we use them to obtain <drumroll> pointers
    to driver-supplied objects.  And that's where the lack of refcounting,
    locking, etc. bites you.
Ha, Al - did you try to understand?
Given a number, one can copy it around freely, without the need
to obtain a reference each time one copies it.
Many of these numbers are just copied around and never used.
In such a case, refcounting is a real waste of time.
But if one really wants to use the number, then a lookup is done,
and one gets a properly refcounted pointer.
So, instead of the dogmatic "numbers are bad", one might try
to estimate the cost of always refcounting versus the cost of
sometimes doing a lookup.
    Let's sort that mess out for good.  Papering over this stuff won't do
    us any good and will only bring more kludgy interfaces.  $DEITY witness,
    we already have enough of those.
[this sounds like the canonical content-free diatribe]
    It's not about pointers vs. numbers - ...
[stuff I completely agree with deleted]
    By now all uses of mk_kdev()/major()/minor()/MAJOR()/MINOR() in the drivers
    are either trivially removable or represent very real problems.  And it's
    not that there was a lot of them - in my current tree there's ~85 instances
    of kdev_t in the source.  And only one of them (->i_rdev) is widely used -
    ~500 instances, most of them go away as soon as CIDR patch gets merged.
    The rest is part noise, part real bugs that need to be fixed anyway
    (~40--80 of those).
Yes, I tend to agree. Funny that you do not mention MKDEV - that was
the thing I worked on eliminating long ago.
