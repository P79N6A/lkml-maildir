Well the documentation is a bit inadequate.
The reality is a bit more complicated and reveals if you look at the
actual usage pattern:
1. Two drives on a channel share them.
2. primary and secondary channel are tightly coupled by the
    host controller hardware (in esp the PIIX) and have to
    be allocated in one go.
3. Some host controllers don't like it if you really use the last entry.
4. trm380 can deal with much more then anybody else.
