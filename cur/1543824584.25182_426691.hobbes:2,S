Anytime you start to make unquantified assumptions in the context of / 
dev/random
the issue turns up that this whole thing is not worth the trouble  
because much
simpler approaches will be sufficient enough to acomplish what it  
does. On the other
hand you can't provide any actual full analysis of it's behaviour -  
which is just
*not acceptable* for anybody trully concerned. And this in  
conjunction makes the WHOLE
idea behind it questionable.
