Hi,
I applaud removing such legacy-should-be-dead-by-now functions; however,
I'm not entirely sure your conversion is correct. While you convert all
places that do cli/sti with locks.... you do not seem to be adding the
locks to the places that the cli/sti pairs protected against (the IRQ
handlers).... so it looks like your conversion is incomplete ;(
Greetings,
