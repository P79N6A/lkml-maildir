I don't know yet, and I may never know :-) I've been running it for a
while and so far works but that's what I thought yesterday of -rt13. It
is not practical for normal use, it just heats the cpu unnecessarily and
there's no way to control it other than a reboot. I'll keep my machine
running like this till I go home later.
