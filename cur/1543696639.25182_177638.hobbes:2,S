Oh, I didn't notice that file. :-)
Recreating is just booting and waiting for a week, but the box is still up.
This is the line that stands out (complete file attached, 137 lines).

I seem to remember a changelog mentioning a leak being fixed in ipv6 code, 
but it looks like there may be another one? The only ipv6 service running is 
sshd, and the mrtg-sshs that go off every 5 minutes are NOT over ipv6. 
netstat -na shows nothing interesting. Only the ssh I connect with uses a bit 
of ipv6 (ffff:1.2.3.4). So, one listening socket, and one established.
$ cat /proc/net/sockstat6
TCP6: inuse 2
UDP6: inuse 0
RAW6: inuse 0
FRAG6: inuse 0 memory 0
$ cat /proc/net/rt6_stats 
0000 0006 0000 0008 0000 0008 0003
nothing over 6 in /proc/net/dev_snmp6/*
$ cat /proc/net/snmp6
