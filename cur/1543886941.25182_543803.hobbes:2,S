It was °C, and that's IMHO better readable than some kind of "degrees C".
Only using 7bit ASCII might have been a good advice in the last 
millenium. But in the current millenium, most environments handle UTF-8 
just fine.
And we are only talking about documentation and comments - IOW, things 
not visible for someone running a kernel. Code (including printk's) must 
stay 7bit ASCII.
In the worst case, if you managed to find a not UTF-8 capable 
environment for viewing the kernel sources, the few characters that are 
not 7bit ASCII are displayed incorrectly, and you'll have to guess which 
character someone might place in front of a "C" describing something 
named wBAT_TEMP (you will likely guess it correctly).
And it's nothing new, comments containing non 7bit ASCII characters are 
already present in 10 year old kernels (often, but not limited to,
developer's names).
