As a heads-up.
This one breaks the fragmentation reduction patch in 32 bit emulation mode.
Our test case shows the standard 17 fragmented regions in /proc/self/maps (as in
the 2.6 standard kernel) vs the 2 regions in 2.6.12-rc5-mm2 (and before).
Somehow the new way of detecting 32 bit remulation mode seems to fail here.
I'll try to figure out a fix.
