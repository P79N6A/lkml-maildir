Actually we reset the flag on every context switch, so that works just fine.
But I was considering to do it less often so that we switch the FP 
state non lazily for FP intensive processes and avoid the overhead
of all these exceptions.

P.S.: Original profile data looks a bit fishy. Normally avoiding a single
function call should not make tht much difference unless you call
it in a inner loop, but that is not the case here.
