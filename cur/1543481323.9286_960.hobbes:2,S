If you have any of these drives that are stable with DMA and or UDMA
transfers, I need the model plus firmware information reported by
hdparm -i /dev/hdx.
Should your drive have drive that fails, I need that information also.

Model=WDC AC32500H FwRev=24.09P07 good DMA
Model=WDC AC31600H FwRev=23.16U73 good DMA
This is my database for a new test in the works.
I need more reference points.
Cheers,
