I have been seeing some odd errors in 2.4.20.
KERNEL: assertion (newsk->state != TCP_SYN_RECV) failed at tcp.c(2229)
KERNEL: assertion 
((1<<sk2->state)&(TCPF_ESTABLISHED|TCPF_CLOSE_WAIT|TCPF_CLOSE)) failed 
at af_inet.c(689)
KERNEL: assertion (newsk->state != TCP_SYN_RECV) failed at tcp.c(2229)
KERNEL: assertion 
((1<<sk2->state)&(TCPF_ESTABLISHED|TCPF_CLOSE_WAIT|TCPF_CLOSE)) failed 
at af_inet.c(689)
KERNEL: assertion (newsk->state != TCP_SYN_RECV) failed at tcp.c(2229)
KERNEL: assertion 
((1<<sk2->state)&(TCPF_ESTABLISHED|TCPF_CLOSE_WAIT|TCPF_CLOSE)) failed 
at af_inet.c(689)
Could some one tell me what that means and if I should be worried.
Also  I get alot other TCP: messages  Could some one explain to me what 
these mean?
