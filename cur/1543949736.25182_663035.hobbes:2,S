Hi Jeremy,

Ah, it's supposed to be
if (kernel_text_address((unsigned long)addr)) {
  pages[0] = virt_to_page(addr);
  vaddr = vmap(pages, 1, VM_MAP, PAGE_KERNEL);
  memcpy(&vaddr[(unsigned long)addr & ~PAGE_MASK], opcode, len);
} else
  memcpy(addr, opcode, len);

Not really :
1-byte changes :
- kprobes is a 1-byte breakpoint
- smp alternatives changes an f0 prefix into a 1-byte nop when a single
  CPU is active (the opposite is done when bringing up a second CPU).
Aligned on word size :
- immediate values are aligned on word size
At boot time only, before kernel pages are marked RO :
- alternatives and paravirt are applied at boot time only
But yes, I guess it's cheap and allows supporting users which does not
have their instructions aligned. I'll change it.

Thanks!
