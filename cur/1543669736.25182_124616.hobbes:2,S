It currently does not work for files that are modified by sysfs itself,
because the generic dnotify mechanism only works for file system operations
initiated by the user.
I have verified that adding calls to dnotify_parent() to sysfs_create and
sysfs_hash_and_remove makes it work. I'm not sure about the locking rules
there, so I'm not sending a patch but it should be trivial to do for
someone more familiar with the sysfs code.
