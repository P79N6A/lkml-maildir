Ingo,
this probably has to do something with the random unmotivated
hardlocks which I suffered from with 2.6.23
when I used 2.6.23-based kernels my rig from time to time (sometimes 2
times a day) just locked and wouldn't react to keyboard-input or magic
sysrq key anymore
if I have a more precise look at my memory (in my head) it probably
happened more often around usage with realplayer (<-- at least that
app; 32bit on amd64) [perhaps also with 32bit thunderbird]
the next suspect is nvidia-drivers: with earlier versions this
happened more often for me (that's at least the "feeling" I have)
so you guys might want to start with those 3 points (thunderbird,
realplayer, nvidia-drivers);
considerung use / test with latest cfs-backports would also be a good
idea, with early backports I had some problems, whereas it's now
perfectly stable (fair group scheduling not enabled)
unfortunately I can't / couldn't reproduce it
in addition to that I'm pretty busy right now so I can't investigate
any further ...
hope you also find the culprit for that buggy ;)
Regards
Mat
