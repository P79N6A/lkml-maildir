Sigh...  How many do you want?  Look, couple of days ago I'd done the
following: picked a random number in range 1..`wc -l fs/devfs/base.c`,
checked what function it was in (devfs_readdir()) and spent less than
two minutes reading it before finding a bug (a leak - there's a couple
of paths that grab an entry and return without releasing it).
So tell me how many times I should repeat that exercise and while you
are at it, tell me what stops you from doing the same.  Because you
know, reading devfs code is something I'd rather avoid - it's not my
idea of fun reading.  IF it will stop you from claiming "Al hadn't
done public whippings lately, so devfs is bug-free" for a couple of
months - by all means, tell how many bugs do I need to find and report
to shut you up for a while.
Richard, devfs code is _ripe_ with bugs; you can't spit into it without
hitting one.  And excuse me, but when finding one is a matter of two
minutes I can't believe that you are incapable of doing that on your own.
It used to be annoying; by now it's beyond annoying - it's ridiculous.
