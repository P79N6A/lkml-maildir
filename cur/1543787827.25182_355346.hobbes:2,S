I would agree that it makes sense for resource release functions to be
written defensively and be able to cope with being passed a NULL
resource, just like kfree(), vfree(), crypto_free_tfm() and others are
already doing.
Seems safer and allows us to get rid of checks for NULL before calling
such functions thus making code simpler, more readable and in some
cases smaller.
