Hey,
  Does anybody know how to find the specific information included in the file 
descriptor in Linux. When a file is created, the file manager creates a file 
descriptor, in which it stores detailed information about the file. But I do 
not know where I can find this detailed information? Does command ls -l 
display all the information included in the file descriptor.
  Does anybody can help me?
  Thanks in advance
