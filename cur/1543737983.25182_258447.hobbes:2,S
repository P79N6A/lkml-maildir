I recently upgraded from linux 2.4.27 to 2.6.8.1 and noticed my laptop 
now makes a high pitch noise while idle. I traced it back to the 
processor module for acpi. 'rmmod processor' stops the noise. 
Using speed step to turn it down to 733 Mhz makes it a 
        little quieter and doesn't change the tone. 
Is there any way to stop this? I googled around and found it had 
something to do with idle frequency of 1000 Hz in 2.6 instead of 100Hz 
in the 2.4 kernel. I couldn't find much else on this. Hunting around the 
code didn't help much, I don't know C. 
The laptop is a Compaq Evo N160 from Dec 2001. The reference in google 
was to a Centrino laptop with the same problem. I wrote to Dominik 
Brodowski who suggested posting here.
