Subject: [DVB patch 0/5] DVB update, mostly dvb-usb

Hi Andrew,
Here's another update for DVB. Two of the patches are
huge (sigh), one drops the dibusb driver, and the
other adds a generalized dvb-usb driver. Both dibusb
and dvb-usb were written by Patrick Boettcher, and
dvb-usb is a refactored version of the dibusb driver,
extended to support a whole zoo of devices.
Unforunately the dvb-usb patch comes with some
incompatible changes to the dibcom frontend drivers,
so we can't have both the dibusb and the dvb-usb drivers.
The dvb-usb driver has been in CVS for more than a
month and is considered stable by its author.
The two big patches probably exceed the mailing list
limit and are also available here:
http://linuxtv.org/downloads/patches/2.6.12-rc4-3/quilt/dvb-remove-dibusb-driver.patch
http://linuxtv.org/downloads/patches/2.6.12-rc4-3/quilt/dvb-add-dvb-usb-driver.patch
Please apply.
Thanks,
Johannes
