As stated in my previous mail, I don't agree here... there are
dependencies that cannot be dealt otherwise. USB was an example
(ieee1394 is another), IDE is one, SCSI, i2c, whatever ... 
Of course, if we consider those "bus" drivers not to have class
and thus not to be stopped and only the "leaf" devices to get stopped,
that may work... I'm not sure we are not missing something there
though...
