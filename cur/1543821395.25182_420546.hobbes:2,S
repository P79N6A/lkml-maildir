I tried something very similar to this years ago, except I made it
explicit instead of hiding it in the blk_run_backing_dev() which we
didn't have at that time. My initial results showed that you would get a
load of requests for different pages so would end up doing io randomly
instead again.
Your patch isn't exactly pretty, but that is fixable. I'm more
interested in how you'd control that sanely.
