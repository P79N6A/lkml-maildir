I'm seeing a problem on ARM with -rc3-mm3 and -rc4-mm1. -rc3-mm2 and
-rc4 are fine and looking for the problem reveals the problems start
after these patches are applied:

The system appears to be ok and boots happily to a console but if you
load any graphical UI, the screen will blank and the process stops
working (tested with opie and and xserver+GPE). You can kill -9 the
process but you can't regain the console without a suspend/resume cycle
which performs enough of a reset to get it back. chvt and the console
switching keys don't respond.
I tried the patch mentioned in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/28/304
 but it
makes no difference.
