Ok - so now you've broken alpha build ;(.
Yes - as your patch comment explains, the alternatives suck worse.
I'll send a patch that provides a NULL pm_power_off pointer for alpha,
which in my 43 seconds of deep analysis of this issue, seems to be the
thing to do for arch's that don't define a useful pm_power_off.
