Well, at early 2.3 times, Riley Williams announced he'd be willing
to take the maintainership as Peter Moulder (who did good job btw) 
had said he had no more time to do it. There was talk about porting it
to 2.3:

Then on October, Pierre Peiffer asked for directorions to port e2compr to        
2.4, and people like Eric Biederman replied. See: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100209862820677&w=2
(I have stared at the code long enough to know I'm not up to the task        
(that was when I tracked down a lock up bug that happened with samba, and       
Peter later fixed.) ;)
That said, it would be cool if e2compr would be ported to 2.[45].
