Hmm.. Can you try to pinpoint more exactly the change that caused it?

Don't pull one at a time - instead just get my latest BK tree, and then
you can do
	bk clone -ql -rXXXX linus-BK test-tree
to get a tree with the top-of-tree being XXXX.
Together with "bk revtool" you can traverse the merge tree to decide on
interesting points you want to back up further with. If, for example,
the kernel still doesn't work at XXXX, you can then do a 
	cd test-tree
	bk revtool 
	.. find an interesting spot YYYY ...
	bk undo -aYYYY
to clip some changes from the test-tree to see if that helps.
