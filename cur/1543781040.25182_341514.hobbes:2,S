Does this patch actually fix it? It shouldn't.
The logic is like this: If a default ACL is associated with the parent
when the inode is created, xattrs will be locked so that the ACL can be
inherited. Since reiserfs_new_inode is called from the VFS layer with
inode->i_sem downed, {set,remove}xattr is locked out. The default ACL
can't be removed/added/changed while reiserfs_new_inode is running.
Therefore, if there is a default ACL, xattrs must be locked.
