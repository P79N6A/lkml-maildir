Mel,
There's no question that that's the case today.  However, there are good 
reasons for using a largish filesystem blocksize, 16K for example, once it 
becomes possible to do so.  With an active volume mounted using 16K blocks, 
you'd see that the balance of allocations shifts towards order 2.  The size 
of the shift will be workload-dependent, ranging from almost no order 2 
allocations, to almost all.  To keep things interesting, it's quite possible 
for the balance to change suddenly and/or strongly.

But how will you shuffle those pages around?
