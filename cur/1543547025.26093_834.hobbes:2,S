Maybe I wasn't very clear... What I mean is that drivers that use
blk_queue_make_request (such as md) are handed buffers directly and
don't get requests added to their queues in the regular sense, instead
they remap b_rdev before ll_rw_blk gets the queue for the device and
adds them to the destination queue.
So per request accounting isn't done for md currently, although (as per
your next mail) I do agree that having statistics for both makes sense.
