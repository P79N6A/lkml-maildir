No, that's not correct.  We rekey once at most every five minutes, and
that requires a SHA hash, but in the normal case, it's only a partial MD4.
An AES encrypt for every TCP connection *might* be faster, but I'd
want to time it to make sure, and doing a bulk test ala "openssl
speed" isn't necessarily going to be predictive, as I've discussed earlier.
