What this functionality requires is that MS_ASYNC is a full barrier wrt.
dirtyness. That is, we want to call set_page_dirty_mappig() as soon as
we touch a page in a dirtying fashion after MS_{,A}SYNC gets called.
Hence we need the full page_mkclean() functionality, otherwise we don't
set AS_CMTIME again in time.
