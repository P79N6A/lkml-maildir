Microsoft basically does this when installing the OS:
if (on good bios list)
	install in ACPI mode
else if (bios date after x)
	install in ACPI mode
else
	install in APM/legacy mode
Note that they do this at system install time, so if you install in APM,
upgrade bios, you're still in APM mode.
I think the same thing is appropriate for us, but system boot may be a
better time to make the choice.
