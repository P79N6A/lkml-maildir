But it doesn't look like dma_alloc_coherent is guaranteed to return
memory allocated from the regular page allocator, nor even memory
backed by a struct page.
For example, I see one that returns kmalloc()ed memory. If the pages
for the slab are already allocated then __GFP_COMP will not do anything
there. i386 looks like it has a path that uses ioremap...
Now I haven't looked through all these closely like you will have, but
I'd like to know how __GFP_COMP solves all the potential problems I
see.
