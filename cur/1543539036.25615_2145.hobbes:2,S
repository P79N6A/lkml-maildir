I am using amd processor k6-II 400 mhz. I have the ali15 chipset. 
I have not been able to compile a kernel since 2.3.99-test1-ac13.
It always fails during make dep. with a message saying that there 
is a kernel bug in buffer.c at line 2443.
I am not a computer programmer, so I have no idea what this 
means.
