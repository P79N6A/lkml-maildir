In a strange twist, the last-call draft contains a clause that
expressly permits some forms of "tivoization", provided a suitable
contractual arrangement exists ("Basic Permissions", second
paragraph).
Now a lot of the free software market follows this "sell yourself into
slavery" model (and even the FSF recommends to make money this way),
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to state it so plainly in the
license.
