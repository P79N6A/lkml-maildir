Not to rain on anyone's parade, I've done my own testing of 2.4 and for
some networking stuff it is literally twice as good as 2.2, but I find
the statements below to be pretty misleading.
Aren't these quoted results from *static* web page tests?  And didn't 
Linux use khttp?  If so, then unless NT is also using a kernel resident
server, comparing these is perhaps useful for marketing but is not useful
for engineering (and this is absolutely an engineering forum).
For us, in this forum, the point of benchmarks should be to expose where
there is room for improvement, ideally compared to a theoretical limit
(Linus' definition of "the best", one that I agree with), or compared to
some other platform.  Looking at the results below, you'd think that Linux
screams.  And it does, but on what I believe is an apples to oranges 
comparison.
I'd be far more interested in seeing NT and Linux compared on something
which uses http to get a 20 little CGI scripts which do nothing but say
"I am script #18", and are implemented on both platforms as stand alone
perl programs.
I think Linux is likely to smoke NT on that, but I'd like to know that.
Any takers?
