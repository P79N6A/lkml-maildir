Ingo, of course it was a joke.
Even having main dispatcher as epoll/kevent loop, the _whole_ threadlet
model is absolutely micro-thread in nature and not state machine/event.
So it does not have events at all, especially with speculations about
removing completion notifications - fire and forget model.
