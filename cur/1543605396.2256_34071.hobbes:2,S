I have been running 2.4.10-ac11 for 7 days now with
TCP_CONNTRACK_CLOSE_WAIT set to 120 seconds - this has stopped nearly
all firewall activity on established connections.
I use "mc" extensively for ftp, and previously would get numerous blocks
after closing a session or starting another ftp session with the same
instance of "mc".
What would we need to do to make these values tuneable either via
insmod/modprobe or /proc?
