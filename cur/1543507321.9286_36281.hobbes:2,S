good idea ...
general memory block transformation routines :)
just like C++ STL generic algorithm applying interface ...
struct transformation_module{
...
};
struct transformation_applying_point{
...
};
struct transformation_applying_ruleset{
...
};
...
transform(skb,transformation_algo,transformation_data);
...
if (device_output_queue->transformations_list)
 apply_transformations	(
	TRANSFORM_SKB_AT_DEVICE_OUTPUT_QUEUE,
	(void*)skb,
	device_output_queue->transformations_list	);
for justification, there could be an reference rot13 transformation
module :)
or even more innocent - byteorder swaping transformation :)
I feel I am been missing possibility for rot13 transformation of all IP
packets for longer.
