I agree, having cleanly supported PAG support in the kernel would be
great. The problem is that we can't just "keep sticking on the side of
it". We'd be perfectly happy to do so - that's the way we do it on every
other unix platform that afs has EVER supported as far as I know.
The problem is that certain kernel developers have specifically and
intentionally (YES, intentionally, I've seen the discussions.) gone to
efforts to prevent the AFS developers from continuing to do this. We're
just looking for an alternative that allows AFS to continue to function
at all on newer kernels than 2.4.
