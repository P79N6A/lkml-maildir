Rene testing the patch Yinghai Lu sent would can reveal reliably whether 
it works fine for all Duron steppings?

Please explain why having this code twice in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/common.c
should be safer than doing the logical thing of putting it into an own 
function:
void clear_set_pat(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c)
{
	clear_cpu_cap(c, X86_FEATURE_PAT);
	switch (c->x86_vendor) {
	case X86_VENDOR_AMD:
		if (c->x86 >= 0xf && c->x86 <= 0x11)
			set_cpu_cap(c, X86_FEATURE_PAT);
		break;
	case X86_VENDOR_INTEL:
	if (c->x86 == 0xF || (c->x86 == 6 && c->x86_model >= 15))
			set_cpu_cap(c, X86_FEATURE_PAT);
		break;
	}

I'm actually on a crusade against:
- the many empty or unusable commit descriptions that recently came
  through the x86 tree
- the fact that Yinghai Lu ignored Pavel's valid commit to not do
  copy&paste programming
