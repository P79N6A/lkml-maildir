Just reading the code.

No, its not a deadlock. Its just a potential performance
problem. 
Actually, ext2 is full of calls to mark_buffer_dirty() while holding the
superblock lock. Juan Quintela (which is being CC'ed) has a patch to
minimize the contention of the superblock lock by calling balance_dirty()
only after the sb lock gets unlocked all over ext2. Would you accept that
patch for 2.4?
Moreover, it seems mark_buffer_dirty does not makes a lot of sense wrt
balance_dirty:
---
/* atomic version, the user must call balance_dirty() by hand
   as soon as it become possible to block */
void __mark_buffer_dirty(struct buffer_head *bh)
{
        if (!atomic_set_buffer_dirty(bh))
                __mark_dirty(bh);
}
void mark_buffer_dirty(struct buffer_head *bh)
{
        __mark_buffer_dirty(bh);
        balance_dirty(bh->b_dev);
}
--- 
If we call mark_buffer_dirty() on an already dirty buffer, we may sleep
waiting for bdflush even if we haven't caused _any_ real disk IO (because
the buffer was already dirty anyway).
I think it makes more sense if we only call balance_dirty if we actually
caused real disk IO.
Would you accept a patch to change that situation by making
__mark_buffer_dirty return the old dirty bit value and make
mark_buffer_dirty only sleep on bdflush if we dirtied a clean buffer?
