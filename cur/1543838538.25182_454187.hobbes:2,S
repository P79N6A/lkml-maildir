A couple of things.
-  I think do_each_pid_task is probably the most descriptive name
   I can come up with.  As these are tasks of a pid.  I don't quite understand
   where the old name came from.
- Whatever we pick for the new function is the name we are going to use
  for a long time so I don't want it to be clumsy.  The existing function
  will go away after everything is updated.
- If you pick the wrong one you will get a compile error, as integers and
  pointers are not very interchangeable.
I hate the temporary confusion but I don't see a better alternative.
