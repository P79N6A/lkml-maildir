You can get the specifications for the SPI family of interfaces at
http://www.oiforum.com/public/impagreements.html
 .  However, it is an
electrical (physical and link layer) interface.  It does not specify a
host interface, since the interesting feature of most devices is not
an SPI-4 interface.
There may be cards out there that do have SPI-4 interfaces and Linux
drivers, but the two are not necessarily related: the likely problem
areas for a device driver are those shared with any 10 Gbit card, and
are not specific to SPI-4 cards.
