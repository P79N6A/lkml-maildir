Re-CC'd to linux-kernel, hope you don't mind.
Anyone interested in testing patches, this simple change is what needs
testing on various PCI and CardBus modems:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg34097.html
(since it's a web archive, you may have to hack the patch in manually...)
It seems straightforward enough, and both tytso and I think the change
is ok, but (at tytso's suggestion) I'm going to test some various
winmodem and other use cases because assuring ourselves that it is good
enough for a general rule...
