This is a `there-is-work-going-on' signal ;)
Got the dependency handling somewhat functional.  Unselect "Loadable
module support", and see how it works.  I wonder if this should be
called a `theorem prover'.
Notice that `functional != working' ;)
This release introduces the `j-k-space' configuration in menuconfig,
which means that the kernel can be completely configured using the keys
j (down), k (up) and space (toggle, select etc.).
Symbol files are now in a seperate tarball.
`Apparent' changes in version 0.1.3
  - Dependency handling (menuconfig)
  - Seperate binaries for each type of config
  - Expanding shorhand notations in dependencies
  - Correct handling of empty expressions
  - Correct handling of line numbers in symbol files
  - Values can also be enclosed in single quotes
  - New tag `rules:' to specify generic constraints
  - Code cleanups and restructuring, as usual ;)
