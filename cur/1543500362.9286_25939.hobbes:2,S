This is an idea I have had before; I ran with it farther, though.  I lack
  yet the knowledge to implement it (or even know if it is really
  feasible.
Actually, it is a thought provoking idea.  Why stop at URLs, though?
  I would see it being kind of useful in the Microsoft-ish direction of
  internet-integration.  Create a "filesystem" which performs anonymous
  (or not; don't know much about filesystems yet) FTP, HTTP fetches,
  etc.  Imagine getting news by simply cat'ing /net/http/www.cnn.com.  
  Or grabbing a file of yours on another system (say serv1.moo.edu)
  by cp /net/ftp/serv1.moo.edu/the/file/is/here/file.txt file.txt
  The user/admin can choose to use the "filesystem" or not by mounting it 
  or not or deselecting it in his/her kernel config, to add some choice
  in the matter and for a modicum of security.
Organize the filesystem by protocol at the top layer, and use different
  controls to change parameters (like ioctl, but I don't know if such
  controls exist for such things.  Such a tool would make the filesystem
  able to do non-anonymous ftp and control some bits.
It would be a huge challenge, though.  I think it would be worth it, though.
