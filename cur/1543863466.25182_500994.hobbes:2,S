Ok, damn you.  I admit I thought of exactly this case and then glossed it
over because I didn't want to complicate the patch and discuss the arcane
justification.  And I was doing a good job of repressing the memory of it
completely before you dredged it up.

I didn't test it either.  And I do sort of think the vDSO should be (the
only thing) in that case's core dump on anal principle.  Now that you've
brought it up, I feel all dirty for ever having sent in code that doesn't
cover the case.  (Not that we really care, since CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO won't
actually be turned on in practice.)
Starting the loops with "vma = current->mm->mmap ?: gate_vma" should do it.
But I guess Andrew would prefer it:
static struct vm_area_struct *first_vma(struct task_struct *tsk,
					struct vm_area_struct *gate_vma) 
{
	struct vm_area_struct *ret = tsk->mm->mmap;
	if (ret)
		return ret;
	return gate_vma;
}
and:
	for (vma = first_vma(current); vma; vma = next_vma(vma, gate_vma)) {
Thanks,
Roland
