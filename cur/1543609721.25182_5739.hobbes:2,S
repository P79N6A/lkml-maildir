Hi All,
Haven't posted or been around in a while so I hope this isn't a rehash.
I didn't find anything in a quick goggle search...
I'm having trouble writing CDs. I'll get from 0% to 75% (varies)
through the process and the whole machine locks up, no oops and nothing
in the log after a restart.
I've been running a 2.2.19-6.2.12 kernel (RH 6.2 updated rpm). And today
I tried using a monolithic vmlinuz-2.2.20 with identical results.
Here is a typical record command, I've tried it at 2, 4 and 8 speed.
cdrecord -v speed=8 dev=0,3,0  -data ~ftp/pub/ISOs/enigma-i386-disc1.iso 
I'm running an AMD Athlon Processor at 1200MHz on a Soyo SY-K7VTA PRO   
board with lots of ram and no other responsibilities.                   
below is the scsi details, has anyone heard of similar problems?
