I wanted to say two things:
1. Those two lines in ip_forward.c must be deleted. They are wrong
   as soon as ip_masq become more clever.
2. ip_masq_user does not get maddr, which is wrong.

Parse error 8) I did not understand you, honestly.

The only reason was that ip_masq was not enough clever to make this itself.
Reread my explanation again. If it is tought now, it can be removed
together with argument "maddr".
In any case, masquerading within policy routing is too late to remove
in 2.2, so that the code should be correct.

If it were true, it would always return. Now maddr is always not zero
due to those lines in ip_forward.
