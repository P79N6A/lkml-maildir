I think one source of argument here is that (for examples) OLTP, news
spooling, and software development are almost, but not quite, totally
unlike one another in the ways they use storage, so different folks have
different priorities. It's fairly easy to see how EROS is a win for OLTP,
but this may not be so clear for other activities.
