No, if you turn it into a trylock, it will randomly fail if any other 
process is holding the lock for whatever reason. So you will still get 
spurious -ENOSPCs, although with lower probability.

But that premature ENOSPC possibility will still exist.
The only right solution that I see is to drop this flushing code at all 
(because it's unfixable), catch -ENOSPCs exactly before you are about to 
return them to Linux VFS, flush at this point (you are not holding any 
locks here) and retry.
There seems to be more bugs with forgetting to flush delayed allocation 
--- you should flush delayed allocation after *every* failed allocate 
attempt, but the code flushes it only after failed delayed allocate 
attempt --- i.e. nondelayed allocators, such as xfs_iomap_write_direct 
(and maybe other places) will still return -ENOSPC without attempting to 
flush other inodes with delayed allocation.
Syncing should be really moved at the topmost place.

This is what I tried: I turned that 500ms wait into a completion:
Use xfs_sync_inodes and not sync_blockdev. sync_blockdev writes dirty 
metadata buffers, it doesn't touch inodes and pages at all.
Also, change that 500ms delay to a wait for completion, so that the
behavior is not dependent on magic timeout values. XFS developers insist
that it can't deadlock (I hope they're right).
