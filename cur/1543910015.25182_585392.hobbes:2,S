A whole bunch of atomic_read uses will be broken without the volatile 
modifier once we start removing barriers that aren't needed if volatile 
behavior is guaranteed.
barrier() clobbers all your registers.  volatile atomic_read() only 
clobbers one register, and more often than not it's a register you 
wanted to clobber anyway.
