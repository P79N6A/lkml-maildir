I think that for the initial test just installing older version of 
bluez-utils might be enough to verify whether they do or don't cause the 
BUG to trigger.

Thanks. Looks like there are the following reports that could potentially 
be used to switch the dongle from HID to HCI (assuming that Logitech 
didn't change behavior of its devices too much)
ff 80 00 00 03 00
ff 80 80 02 00 00
ff 80 80 01 00 00
(and maybe ff 80 09 01 00 00 ?)
This doesn't look like what is currently supported by hid2hci function 
switch_logitech(), but I would rather leave this to Marcel.
Thanks,
