Ok. Fair enough. The new "run the child first" approach has advantages,
but it is entirely possible that the advantages unfairly prioritize things
that do a lot of forking.

This, however, is a bash bug, not a kernel issue. Bash does something
strange with the terminal and ignores ^C at times, and basically only
react correctly to the ^C under the right circumstances. Changing the
child to run first probably makes the pre-existing bug much easier to see.

Reverting it outright may be an acceptable approach. I'll think about
it: the arguments _for_ the patch are true and real, and it shows up as
real improvements on some things..
An alternative approach might be to not give the child the _whole_
timeslice, but give it more than half. Partition it out 66% - 33% or
something.
