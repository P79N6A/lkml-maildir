I could if I had any. The _RT run had NO latency traces > 250 usec (the
limit I had set for the test). The equivalent _PK run had 37 of those
traces. I can rerun the test with a smaller limit to get some if it is
really important. My build of -12 is almost done and we can see what kind
of repeatability / results from the all_cpus trace shows.
