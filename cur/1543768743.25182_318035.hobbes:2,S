On FreeBSD the default thread stack size is not computed from ulimit -s,
but is constant.  They apparently only recently increased it to 1MB
(resp. 2MB on 64-bit arches), from 64K.
On Linux, the default thread stack size (except with fixed stack LinuxThreads)
is determined from ulimit -s (with a constant default if ulimit -s is
unlimited).
If your threaded application has specific needs for stack sizes, it can
always pthread_attr_setstacksize to whatever you find appropriate.
The thread library needs to know the stack size limit before creating
the thread, that can't be changed dynamically.
