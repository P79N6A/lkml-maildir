Weird, that's unrelated path.  It seems sd->s_parent is NULL in
sysfs_link_sibling(), which doesn't make sense because it's being called
from sysfs_create_link() which makes sure parent_sd isn't NULL &&
sysfs_addrm_start() should have caused oops earlier as it deferences
parent_sd.
Can you please retry the test (test clean 2.6.22-rc6-mm1, apply patch,
rebuild and test)?
Thanks.
