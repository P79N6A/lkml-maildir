Preface: I have no plan of kbuild and kernel configuration, so take this
with a grain of salt. But maybe it gives me the chance to calm all this
because I'm not biased towards either side.
Are you telling that kernel programmers don't rewrite code from scratch?
Is that a correct interpretation of "improve the existing system"? Note
that "it can't be done" can also imply "cannot reasonable be done".
If that's not what you mean, stop reading this mail, drop a line to
clarify this and forget this piece of mail. If it _is_ what you mean,
then with all due respect, why cannot kernel programmers rewrite a
subsystem (even if it interfaces with the whole world of kernel
configurations) from scratch?
Eric has done it, without being of kernel hacker temple's fame.
Whether he doesn't listen to other developers, I cannot tell, I got my
/fetchmail/ issues resolved. Still, I share the opinion that the kernel
build stuff is mainly for developers (and if it cuts down turnaround
times, it well deserves a try), and if -- as a side effect -- it's good
for the user, so be it, and if it's clear and self documenting, that's
nothing a developer would reject. Resurrecting this IMHO dead thread
around Mrs. Tillie won't bring any good. (Although Aunt Tillie should
really get her kernel as .deb or .rpm.)
AFAICS, Eric has gone lengths to get a competitive kernel configuration
system working well enough for production use, minor issues seem to
remain, like split Configure.help. I can easily understand no-one is
throwing this work away. If he's convinced the system is more consistent
and robust in itself, that's good -- but all this advocacy seems to be
torn down to some (personal) vendetta. Linux does not deserve that.
What I'm missing in this thread are facts. The point "communications
problem" has been raised. It seems to me as though the two opposing
parties (pro and con CML2) were not clear about what they expect from
the other party. If something has gone on behind the scenes, well, I
will have missed it...
I'm really hoping that this issue can get resolved in one way or
another, my personal opinion is that one single config stuff parser is
the goal, be it mconfig or be it CML2.
