No.  Well, I don't think so anyway.  In 2.5 we now have a pci_bus_read_*
and pci_bus_write_* functions, which the pci hotplug drivers use, as
they at least know the bus on which the devices they are looking for are
on.  I also had to convert over some ACPI code that was using the
pci_read_config functions to get everything to work properly, but I
don't seem to be able to find that code in the latest 2.5 tree, so I
guess you don't need to do that anymore?
(For the LKML readers, this is a spill-over from the pci hotplug and
ia64 mailing lists, where on 2.4 we now have a problem with pci hotplug
drivers as ia64 uses a pci "segment" and the existing pci_*_nodev
functions in the pci hotplug core don't properly set up this field.  See
the archives for either of those lists for more info.)
