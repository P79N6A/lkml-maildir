I'll give it a try and read something more about kobjects and ksets as
well ;-)

For now it could be a module option or even hardcoded in the .ko. It won't
be user-writable anyway, only root-writable. And if root wouldn't want to
use the most preferred module, he could simply not load it...
The reason why I wanted the cra_preference is a situation where a given
functionality is non-modular and compiled into the kernel and requires an
algorithm thet in turn will have to be compiled in as well. Distributors
would of course select the pure software implementation for this. But then
you install a cryptocard - without preferences you couldn't load a module
with driver for it.
