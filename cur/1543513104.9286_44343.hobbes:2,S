Hi,
I believe that we are advised to use copy_to_user() for converting to user
space. But since this is not exported, are we supposed to export it(in
ksyms.c), rebuild the kernel and then use it ? Suppose I want to write device
drivers, the probability is very high that I will have it as a module and the
probability is even higher that I'll have to use functions like
copy_to_user/copy_from_user or the obsolete versions memcpy_tofs/memcpy_fromfs
and these aren't exported. Looks like linux by nature, doesn't encourage
modular devide drivers.
Am I right or am I missing something ?
Forgive me if this a stupid question.
Thanks
Kesava
