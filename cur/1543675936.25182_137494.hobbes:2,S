In this case, I was being stupid with the gethostbyname exmaple. But I 
do know what a kernel is !
To fill in the blanks, I am writing a network based filesystem, and I 
now realise that the place to do the gethostbyname() is in a mount helper.

What I would like to achive is a self-contained module which implements 
a filesystem. The user-space apps then interact with the fs as normal.
I am trying to avoid havng "helper daemons" for various reasons, too 
long to go into here

And if your a filesystem ? Is it really recommended to do;
userspace->kernel->userspace->kernel->userspace ? That seems like a lot 
of context switching to me.

As I said, for my own reasons I would like not to have a deamon like this.
Thanks for the help.
