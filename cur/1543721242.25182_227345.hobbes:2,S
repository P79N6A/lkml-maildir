Hello
I would like to know what's the difference between
Input Core (CONFIG_INPUT) and USB HID (CONFIG_USB_HID) in 2.4.25
They seem to enable the same thing - USB HID. However I don't
know which one should I enable or if I should enable both. I find
existence of two options with seemingly the same function confusing.
