It doesn't matter what your taste is, or mine.  That's why we have
conventions.  We just follow them and don't spend time grousing about
trivia.  The worst thing for a reader is to have the flow broken up by
inconsistent style.  New code follows the conventions.  Old code
(eventually) gets fixed up to follow the conventions.  End of story
(and a deathly dull one it is at that).
Thanks,
Roland
