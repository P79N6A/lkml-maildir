Hmm, I wonder whether something changed.  It shouldn't be possible to
rmmod module b if module a has done a symbol_get on it...  This may mean
more stringent locking will be required after all to support unloading.
That, or a rmmod lsm hook.

No, that's good, thanks.  Though I guess "unloading" of this type won't
be needed if true module deletion has to be supported.

Excellent :)
