Hi!
I had some spare time and decided to make a bash script which generates
(with the help of some description files) a nice HTML Index for
linux-2.6.4/Documentation to give it a better look. (I think it would be
interesting for kernel-hq.)
I did it for 2.6.4, because I had the tarball of it on my hdd. I have a 56k
modem which doesn´t make downloading kernel source fun. (I know that there are
patches, but I´m too lazy.). But it should work with nearly any source version
(should work even "stand alone") but then you have broken links.
The package is not a patch, but a tarball, because I only needed to add files
and not to change any existing.
You can get the tarball at:
  
http://members.aon.at/gwiesner/misc/2_6-html-doc-index.tar.gz
Install it by typing:
  cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.4   # or whatever dir
  cd Documentation
  tar -xzf 2_6-html-doc-index.tar.gz
To generate the HTML files run:
  ./mkhtmlindex.sh
The script will generate a index.html in Documentation
and a index.html in every subdirectory of it. (not recursive, only 1 level)
The descriptions of the files are in the files.desc and dirs.desc files.
I would be glad to hear some feedback.
BTW: This is my first contribution and please CC me, as I´m not in the list.
