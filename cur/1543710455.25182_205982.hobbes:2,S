Is reclaim the same as swapping, though?  I'd expect pages to be
written to the swapfile speculatively, before they are needed for
reclaim.  Is that one of those behaviours which everyone agrees is
sensible, but it's yet to be implemented in the 2.6 VM?

The idea is that you write pages to swap _before_ the memory pressure
arrives, which makes those pages available immediately when memory
pressure does arrive, provided they are still clean.  It's speculative.
I thought Linux did this already, but I don't know the current VM well.
