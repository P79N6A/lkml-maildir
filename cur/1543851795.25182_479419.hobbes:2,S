Hi All, 
I want to write a layered driver for a device in Linux. I am overwriting
make_request_fn in blk_dev strucure. Whenever they is an I/O my
make_request_fn is called so that I can change the buffer_head and send
to other disk by calling submit_bh in my make_request_fn as following.
		bh->b_dev = MKDEV(252,0); // I am changing to other disk
device
		atomic_set(&bh->b_count, 1);
		submit_bh(WRITE, bh);
This is not working. It is giving me kernel panic Could you help me how
should I go about it? 
My purpose is all I/O to Disk1 should to passed to Disk2. 
Regards,
Srinivas
