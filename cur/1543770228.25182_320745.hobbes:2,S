You lost!  CONFIG_HZ didn't get set.
Something obviously went wrong in the magic in kernel/Kconfig.hz.  Wanna do
`grep HZ .config' and see if you can work out why it broke?
Roman, is there a better way of doing the below?
From: Christoph Lameter <christoph@lameter.com>
Make the timer frequency selectable. The timer interrupt may cause bus
and memory contention in large NUMA systems since the interrupt occurs
on each processor HZ times per second.

+	 a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus
