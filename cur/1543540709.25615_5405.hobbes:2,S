It is a pre-flash machine, IBM 380XD, PIIX4, mobile pentium. 
The other tables are present.

Is there a way to build a correct substitute? The motherboard's

I did not activate the interpreter because 120k seemed a bit much.

That answers the question I did not ask for fear of sounding like a
flame:
Q. Why did ACPI go in so late in 2.3?
