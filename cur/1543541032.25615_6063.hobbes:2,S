Has there been any effort to impliment a lottery scheduler (or something of
the sort) under Linux?  I've searched on the web but wasn't able to find
anything.  I've been working on my own, but don't see any reason to reinvent
the wheel here, I'm sure it's been done before, probably better than I could
do.
Mine basically keeps a list of users, and every X clock ticks resets a
ticket counter for each user.  Everytime a users' process is chosen in
schedule(), the number of available tickets is decreased.  When in turn
goodness() is called, the weight is modified based on a the percentage of
remaining tickets/possible tickets. Lastly, sys_txaction allows root to
modify certain values, currently only the number of tickets, weather or not
a user is governed by this restriction, and weather or not a certain process
is governed by the restriction.
I've got no problem posting a patch to 2.2.16 if anyone wants to see it, but
I'm going to warn, I'm not the most experienced kernel hacker here.
