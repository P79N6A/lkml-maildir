Hello,
I have 3 hard disk in ma machine, one IDE and two SCSI. I just
played with windows 98 and my second SCSI disk come with just
one big (more that 8 Gb) partition instead of the ten little I
had on it (in the order: sdb1:NTFS,sdb2:/boot,sdb3:/usr/src,
sdb5:/data,sdb6:/home,sdb7:fat 16,sdb8:linux swap,sdb9:NTFS,
sdb10:/) and I also know the approximate size of each partitions.
Is there a way to reconstruct the table of partition?
I know that the data are still there: cat /dev/sdb...
Please, cc all answer to greg@ulima.unil.ch as I am just near dead...
For all of you that have good table of partition: just fdisk p them
and print that, it could be of some use...
Thanks,
	Greg				mailto:greg@ulima.unil.ch
