booting-without-of.txt should be changed.

OK, let's make the compatible "fsl,mpc885-i2c", "fsl,cpm1-i2c", 
"fsl,cpm-i2c".
For now, match on the last one, but if any differences pop up, we have 
the more specific ones.

Ah, missed that -- there's opendrain support for port E, but I missed 
that port B had it as well.  Feel free to add it.

Gah, I hate powerpc bit numbering, especially without the 
numbered-as-if-64-bit hack.  I specifically looked at the manual before 
to see if it was shifted, saw "0-6", and concluded it wasn't. :-P

That doesn't mean that this isn't a good time to review what the code is 
doing. :-)

If slave operation isn't supported, how is this value used?

OK.  Would that allow it to become one driver, rather than a wrapper and 
an algorithm?
