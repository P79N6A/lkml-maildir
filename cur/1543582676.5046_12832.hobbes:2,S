If the app is not reading from the socket buffer, the receiving TCP is
supposed to stop sending window-updates, and the sender is supposed to
stop sending data when it runs-out of window.
If TCP ACK's data, it really should (must?) not then later drop it on
the floor without aborting the connection. If a TCP is ACKing data and
then that data is dropped before it is given to the application, and the
connection is not being reset, that is probably a bug.
A TCP _is_ free to drop data prior to sending an ACK - it simply drops
it and does not ACK it.
