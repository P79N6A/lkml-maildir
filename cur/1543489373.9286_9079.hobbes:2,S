Subject: PROBLEM: Realtek 8193 network support in kernel 2.2.x

Hi all,
[1.] Can't select RTL8193 device in kernel configuration
[2.]	I just downloaded kernel 2.2.3 and want to compile in support for a
Realtek 8139 network card which I'm installing in my machine soon (and
which will soon be used department wide here at uni when we change over
to UTP cable). However none of the config programs (make
config,menuconfig,xconfig) will let me select the RTL8139 driver. We
have some older kernels running here (2.0.36) which let me compile
support for the 8139, but 2.2.3 does not. Am I missing something stupid,
is it just me or have things changed since 2.0 days.
NB: this also applies to the NI5010, Packet engines yellowfind and
Alteon AceNIC devices as well. I've also looked at 2.2.0,1 and 2 and
none of them offer 8139 either.
