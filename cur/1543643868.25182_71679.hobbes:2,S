this can happen if there's a genuine PID space squeeze wrt. nr_threads -
that is solved by adding Linus' suggestion to the PID allocator. I believe
you saw that problem, not any inherent get_pid() algorithmic inefficiency.
nevertheless we do lock up for 32 seconds if there are 32K PIDs allocated
in a row and last_pid hits that range - regardless of pid_max. (Depending
on the cache architecture it could take significantly more.)
