The workaround hasn't been removed. It's still there,
drivers/acpi/pci_link.c:
788 
789 /* Make sure SCI is enabled again (Apple firmware bug?) */
790 acpi_set_register(ACPI_BITREG_SCI_ENABLE, 1, ACPI_MTX_DO_NOT_LOCK);
791 
The thing is acpi_set_register doesn't permit anymore to write the SCI
bit since the last ACPI merge. Or maybe you meant that the
acpi_hw_register_write modifications should be reverted until a better
solution is found?
Fred.
