Having three interfaces is bad enough ... ensuring that none of
them can ever be used safely would be stupid.

I had earlier pointed out a different issue, whereby "oneshot"
semantics weren't consistently followed.  I've been working on
some patches to address that.  The ACPI bits still need work,
but I'll forward one part soonish.

That's the issue addressed by those patches.  (Specific to rtc-cmos,
not to RTCs on saner hardware.)

Pray tell, *HOW* could it arbitrate?

Yeah, what ever happened to timerfd?  :)

There's the "rtcwake" thing.  That got merged into util-linux-ng, but
I happened to notice its setup_alarm() is calling gmtime() instead
of localtime() ... my suspicion is that the uClibc version I was using
had some timezone bugs, or else there's some other bug lurking in the
vicinity of dual-bootiness.
Note that "wakealarm" is not intende to be a "timed sleep" interface
at all ... it's just to set the wakealarm.  Something else is in charge
of putting the system to sleep, such as "echo mem > /sys/power/state"
or some GUI thing hooked up to logic that knows about how to make frame
buffers recover.
