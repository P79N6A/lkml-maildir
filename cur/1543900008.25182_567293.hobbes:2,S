On the RTC list, the outcome of that discussion was that
the release() method -- not generally implemented at this
time, and only supporting the /dev/rtcN access mode -- should
only disable the IRQs enabled through that /dev/rtcN file.
Now, it turns out that of the three kinds of RTC IRQ (alarm,
once-per-second, and 2^N-per-second), two of those modes can
be accessed through in-kernel APIs outside /dev/rtcN calls:
 - 2^N-per-second "periodic" irqs, using rtc_irq_set_freq()
   and rtc_irq_set_state()
 - alarm irqs, using rtc_set_alarm()
So it would be incorrect to disable those IRQs, when some
other kernel activity had enabled them.  But for now it
would be correct to always disable once-per-second "update"
IRQs in a release() method.
There's a separate issue -- longstanding, not new to the
RTC framework -- of how several consumers of RTC IRQs ought
to share the different kinds of IRQ.

That can be done with /sys/class/rtcN/device/power/wakealarm,
writing it to the time (in seconds) the RTC alarm should kick
the board's power-on circuitry.
