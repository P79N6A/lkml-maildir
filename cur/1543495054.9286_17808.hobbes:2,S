The signal's data contains *only* the file descriptor -- but you need
more.
You can tell which fd the signal refers to, but not
whether the fd is ready for reading or writing
(unless you do a poll() on it after getting the signal,
which adds another system call I'd rather avoid).
Wouldn't it make sense to have three different signals associated
with each fd, corresponding to the three different FD_SETs returned
by select()?  (Or maybe four, one for 'new connection'.)
aio_ lets you do this, but F_SETSIG doesn't, I think.
I know, you can probably get by guessing what the fd is ready
for, but it seems kludgy.
