It's not hard you know[1].

I don't pretend to understand the PM layer at all, but it looks like
that both nmi.c's and oprofile's resume functions will get called. This
won't work: if oprofile has control of the perfctr's/nmi stuff, you
can't let the NMI watchdog's resume() be called, as it may conflict with
what oprofile is trying to resume.

There's some evil spaces in your patch.
