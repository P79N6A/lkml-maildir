Also, when a really good idea *does* come along, (morse code on the
keyboard LEDs, for example), it get included, which is good.
I am thinking of re-wiring the MHz indicator on this machine to the
parallel port, so that it can display the number of unread E-Mails
I've got :-).  The turbo light is currently a SCSI bus activity
indicator.  Oh, and it would be really cool would be two bulbs behind
Linux and BSD case badges, which light up to indicate which OS is
running :-).
