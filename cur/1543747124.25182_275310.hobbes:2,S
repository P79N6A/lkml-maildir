Indeed. Also some report less than the full amount because they only
support VGA modes in the lower bits of memory and others like Intel
ICH/GCH based systems report 1Mb because in essence the question has no
right answer.

Very very few cards have a PCI resource map that gives useful size
information because they have apertures and are sometimes also windowed
or not all CPU accessible.
