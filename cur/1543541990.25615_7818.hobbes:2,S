Interesting.  Here is a bug report I recently made.  Is this related?
Subject: es1371 noisy on my system
Problem summary: sounds played on my system becomes very distorted
when there is another process using a lot of CPU, even if it is niced.
System:
- Red Hat 6.2 with Red Hat's version of 2.2.16.
- the last entry in the change history in
  /usr/src/linux-2.2.16/drivers/sound/es1371.c is:
 *    05.01.2000   0.22  Should now work with rev7 boards; patch by
 *                       Eric Lemar, elemar@cs.washington.edu
- Abit BP6 with 2 Celeron 300a CPUs running at 450MHz (stable, honest!)
- A one year old version of the Sound Blaster / Ensonic card.
  /proc/pci says:
  Bus  0, device  17, function  0:
    Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq ES1371 (rev 6).
      Slow devsel.  IRQ 19.  Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=12.Max Lat=128.
      I/O at 0xb000 [0xb001].
Observations:
- sound is OK (slight crackling) when nothing else is happening on system
- when one CPU-intensive process is run at the same time, the sound is
  bad, but can be understood.  Even if the process is "nice -19"
- when a second CPU-intensive process is run at the same time, the
  sound is almost totally distorted.
- these observations apply even when I change music playing programs.
  I tried:
  - xmms
  - mpg123
  - play applied to a PCM file produced by mpg123 -s
