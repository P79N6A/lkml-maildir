Current users I know of (but there are more):
- e2fsprogs uses it e.g. to create unique UUIDs for disks (it ships an own library for that)
- 
http://commons.apache.org/sandbox/id/uuid.html
 uses it with own libraries
- SAP Netweaver on Linux uses it (
http://www.sap.com/platform/netweaver/index.epx
)
I'm mostly interested in fixing problems I see with SAP (I'm working for SAP).
SAP Netweaver often needs during a very short time frame lots of unique UUIDs 
(to reference the data afterwards) when new data is imported into the database.
Main problem with current implementations is, is that they don't 100% 
guarantee uniqness of the generated UUIDs. Sometimes, esp. on very fast 
multi-processor machines, double UUIDs are generated and returned to the 
application which is very bad and may result in unreliable behaviour.
Current implemenations use userspace-libraries. In userspace you e.g. can't 
easily protect the uniquness of a UUID against other running _processes_.
If you try do, you'll need to do locking e.g. with shared memory, which can 
get very expensive.
My in-kernel implementation does guarantee the uniquness through the mutex.
The problem will get even worse with virtualization technologies like XEN and
containers. There it's even impossible to protect against processes in other VMs.
Another user which could benefit from it are embedded devices. They could 
drop their userspace-implementations in favour of this smaller kernel version
to create UUIDs for their disks, using it in the webservers, ...
Best regards,
Helge
PS:
I did created bugreports against the e2fsprogs userspace implementation 
at Red Hat and Novell (only accessible for RH/Novell employees), but as I 
explained above, the userspace-implementation may not be sufficient:
