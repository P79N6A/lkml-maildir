  DECLARE_PER_CPU (int x[3]);
doesn't work, although you can always do
  typedef int three_ints_t[3];
  DECLARE_PER_CPU (three_ints_t x);
I encountered the same thing while doing a user-space
`MAKE_THREAD_SPECIFIC' macro.  The solution I went for looks like this:
  #define DECLARE_PER_CPU(type, name) \
    __attribute__ ((__section (".percpu"))) __typeof__ (type) name##__per_cpu
