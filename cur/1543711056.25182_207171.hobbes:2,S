  ARP-request is just one more of network packets that are passed
  up into network code like any other by calling  netif_rx().
  As long as the packet is recognizable by the upper layers as
  an SKBUF with ARP request, all will be fine.
  Oh yes,  not all network interfaces need to support ARP at all.
  The PPP is one such example.  Nor do all ARP request frames carry
  same tags as ethernet ARP does.   Nevertheless one can pass ARP-
  requests thru a PPP link. See  drivers/net/ppp*  files about
  how that is handled.
