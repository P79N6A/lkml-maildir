Oh, I didn't know that... what are the alignment requirements?  At the
very least, I can document them in include/linux/sched.h and submit a
patch for that.  It could solve a lot of headache in the future.  Aside
from the "these are hardcoded - don't touch" comment, I don't see anything
that could imply alignment constraints.  The comment above just refers to
the hardcoded member offsets in the arch/ directories, right?  So if I
update those, I should be able to "touch" in order to get a commonly used 
pointer into the first cache line?  Or did I miss something there?
