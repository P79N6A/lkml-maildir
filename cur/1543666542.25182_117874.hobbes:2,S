Has anyone been having IRQ mishandling problems in the later 2.5.6x kernels? 
My poor IBM seems to be panicing randomly with system calls to irq functions. 
1) Panic on sending a 1.3GB file from other PC to the IBM while sound blaster 
was playing some mp3s
2) The IBM Panics when I turn on the PC next to it (NOT grounding problem) we 
get a kernel panic with softirq and timers.
I know timers changed alot from 2.4 -> 2.5 but this problem is a showstopper 
at least for me.
I first thought it was serial related but having the panic happen after 
sending a large file makes me wonder if there's something broken with timers 
and interrupt handling (whos not releasing that timer!).
Thanks, 
Shawn.
