There are 2 problems with this.
a.  CONNECTOR depends on NET, but select won't enable NET, so if
NET is not enabled otherwise, CONNECTOR still won't build.
This is a longstanding select/kconfig issue.
b.  CONNECTOR depends on NET, so if select did follow the depends
chain and enable NET, it would be enabling the networking subsystem,
which is something that should not be done quietly.
select should only be used for enabling small library-like code
(if even then).  Avoid it whenever possible.
