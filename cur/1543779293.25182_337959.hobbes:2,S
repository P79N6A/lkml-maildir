   Ok, here's an optimization that should help reduce contention on the
cmpxchg, has zero impact on the nojitter path, and doesn't require any
changes to fsys.  When a caller already had the xtime_lock write lock
there's no need to fight with other CPUs for the cmpxchg.  The other
"reader" CPUs will have to fetch it again since a seqlock write is in
progress.  Therefore we can simplify this path as shown below.  The
write is atomic, and we don't care if another CPU has changed last_cycle
since it can't return the value until the write lock is released.  This
has only been compile tested, but I'm interested to hear your opinion.
Thanks,
	Alex
