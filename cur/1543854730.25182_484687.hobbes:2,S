My understanding is that Eric has changed UP current (and other PDA ops)
to not touch %gs at all, and the difference in reported times in due
omitting the %gs load in entry.S (though %gs is still save/restored on
the stack).

Yes, that would be my thought too, but maybe there's excessive aliasing
on one of the ways, but I think he's using a Pentium M which has a 8-way L1.

Yes, assuming oprofile doesn't interfere with things too much. 
Actually, just counting cache miss events during the course of a syscall
would be most interesting (ie, no need to sample).
