No, not at all. With memory-to-memory copy, you are I/O bound. With any
CPU that runs faster than memory access (anything faster than a
486-DX/66), you get the checksumming for free if the code is properly
written, which Linux's checksum while copy sees to be.
Also DMA (even if it worked) is not free. The wall clock still runs while
the user-space page(s) are locked into memory.
