Subject: [PATCH 9/12] repost: cciss: add busy_configuring flag
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

PATCH 9 of 12
This patch adds a check for busy_configuring to prevent starting a queue
on a drive that may be in the midst of updating, configuring, deleting, etc.
This had a test for if the queue was stopped or plugged but that seemed
to cause issues.
Please consider this for inclusion.
Thanks,
mikem
