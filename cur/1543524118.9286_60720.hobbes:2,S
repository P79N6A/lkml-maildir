	Early part of the week?  The tutorials are on Tuesday and the
BOFS are on Wednesday and Thursday.  You gonna try for Wednesday?  I
don't quite count "Thursday" as "early part of the week".  :-)
	Seems like there are some other issues vis-a-vis cryptography
in the kernel.  If we have the loopback encryption and CIPE and FreeSWan
and who knows what else using crypto algorithms in the kernel, we really
don't need three implimentations of 3DES, two of Idea, blowfish,
and a partidge in a pear tree.  Maybe a separate BOF on cryptography
in the kernel would be timely, given the resent changes in US export
policy and the changes in policy at crytography.org.
