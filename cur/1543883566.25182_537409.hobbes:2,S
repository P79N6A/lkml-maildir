Could you use the more conventional name %dl (or whatever is being meant)
here?

I think I commented similarly on a previous version of the patch: This will 
- result in still bringing the first 128 bytes into the cache
- prevent caching of memory beyond the buffer being dealt with

Similarly, I continue to believe this is wrong here (again I commented before
that this is likely unnecessary, or if at all, it should be an lfence).

Operations of this type generally should use 'test', not 'or' or 'and'.
