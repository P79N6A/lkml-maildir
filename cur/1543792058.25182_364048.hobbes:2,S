I was having that problem using busybox insmod, changing to latest kernel 
tools was fixed for me, I don't know why, but in my case was a ramdisk to 
load sata drivers before mounting the root disk. Anyway module-init-tools is 
not too bigger even building them with glibc instead uClibc as static 
binaries.
