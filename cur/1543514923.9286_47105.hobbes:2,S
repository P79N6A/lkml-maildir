A patch to Documentation/Changes is in Linus' inbox recommending
2.9.5.0.16 (a stable version kept up by HJ Lu based on cygnus' CVS tree).
Again, though, I've tested binutils down to 2.9.1.0.7 and they all
correctly compile the kernel (albeit suboptimally at times). I'd look
elsewhere for the cause.
