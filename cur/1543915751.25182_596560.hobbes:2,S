Before Calling msg_unlock() they call ipc_rcu_getref() that increments a 
refcount in the rcu header for the msg structure. This guarantees that 
the the structure won't be freed before they relock it. Once the 
structure is relocked by ipc_lock_by_ptr(), they do the symmetric 
operation i.e. ipc_rcu_putref().
