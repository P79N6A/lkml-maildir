Please try to reproduce in:

I spotted many bugs and races there. It's rock solid here while a
clean-2.3.7 was corrupting the fs (due block_partial_write bugs).
Unfortunately such a beast is so different from stock 2.3.7 that it's
quite difficult for me to extract the interesting patches alone without
major editing work :(.
With clean 2.3.7 I also reproduced a complete lockup in shrink_mmap (with
SMP kernel and UP cpu). This never happens in 2.3.7_andrea1 that runs with
bonnie + memoryhog for hours without any sign of corrption (again on an UP
machine with SMP kernel, I am stressing it in real SMP only now that seems
stable on UP). Between 2.3.7 and 2.3.7_andrea1 there's no one common line
in shrink_mmap so I have no idea about the 2.3.7 trouble.
