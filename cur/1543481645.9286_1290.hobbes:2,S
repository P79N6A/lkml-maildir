	When in doubt, never assume a negative connotation of something
ambiguous someone says.  Especially on the net, where less emotional
subtlety makes it through.

	It is not all volunteer work now and is likely to become less so
with time as big money moves into OSS.  The small fry will continue to
innovate at the fringes everywhere, but *relying* on volunteer labor for
support of needed kernel features is not a business option.

	Specifics please, and info as to why this design would be any
better than other NGOSes out there.  I am basing my predictions on OSes I
know exist today, with running code in some form.

	Sure, you can only make a probabilistic statement.  I think it is
very *likely* that within two years, one of the currently-existing NGOSes
will be a competitior to Linux in some area of computing.  In fact, that
is already happening today.  Flick, the high-security cousing of the Fluke
PVM kernel, was developed in a DARPA-sonsored project.  The military is
interested in Flick because it is an interrupt-model kernel which,
provides an inherently cleaner and more watertight design than a
traditional process-model kernel like Linux.

	Fair enough.  I think I have a little Bruce Perens in me sometimes

	That isn't 'very' short by the standards of the OSS development
world.  And things are only going to get faster now that the OSkit is out. 
Maybe I didn;t play that point up enough, but that's what I mean.  You
should see the number coll, wacky research OSes that have been built on
top of the OSkit in a very short (by your standard) timeframe.  It is
pretty impressive, IMHO.

	It isn't an issue of performance, it is an issue of capabilities. 
Hardware keeps getting faster, and I doubt any competitive NGOS would
exhibit a large enough performance gap with Linux to have it be a factor. 
Look at Java.  It is proof that a good idea can come along and cause a
mass exodus if it offers clear benefits.

	I would.  Linus has said many times in the past that he doesn't
see a case for microkernels, which in some form will be the foundation of
most NGOS designs.
