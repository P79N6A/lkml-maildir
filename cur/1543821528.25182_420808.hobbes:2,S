Subject: [NFSD] kconfig: Select things at the closest tristate instead of bool

Hi:
I noticed recently that my CONFIG_CRYPTO_MD5 turned into a y again
instead of m.  It turns out that CONFIG_NFSD_V4 is selecting it to
be y even though I've chosen to compile nfsd as a module.
In general when we have a bool sitting under a tristate it is
better to select things you need from the tristate rather than the
bool since that allows the things you select to be modules.
The following patch does it for nfsd.
