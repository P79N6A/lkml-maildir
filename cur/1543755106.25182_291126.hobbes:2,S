I have posted 4 patches to LKML earlier today. Some of them might fix
some of your problems.

It would be interesting to know at which level the problem appears.
Can you reproduce the problem using "xev"? If xev works as expected,
the problem is possibly that the left mouse button gets stuck and
stops your application from accepting keyboard input. This patch fixes
the button stuck problem:
        [PATCH 1/4] Make mousedev.c report all events to user space immediately
If the keyboard gets stuck also using "xev", the problem is at a lower
level. Enable i8042_debug in drivers/input/serio/i8042.c to see if the
keyboards produces any data in the stuck state.

Probably fixed by this patch:
        [PATCH 2/4] Enable hardware tapping for ALPS touchpads

I see this too when I don't use the X touchpad driver. With the X
driver there is no problem. I think the problem is that mousedev.c in
the kernel has to use integer arithmetic, so probably small movements
are rounded off to 0. I'll try to come up with a fix for this.

You can disable tapping by setting the tap_time parameter for
mousedev.c to 0. The default value is 200ms.
