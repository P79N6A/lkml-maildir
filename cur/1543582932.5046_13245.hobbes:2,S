I got them immediately at the first run, which more or less was what I
expected because reiserfs ate one of my mailfolders that way (only a
CVS log folder, so nothing special was lost). You have to remove the
files between runs, otherwise the same blocks seem to be allocated to
the files.
I'll upgrade to linux-2.4.2 to see if it solves the problem. (was
running 2.4.2-pre4 + your patch)
