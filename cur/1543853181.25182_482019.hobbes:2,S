Yes, I have a test suite (part of the mdadm package - anyone can try
running it - "make everything ; sh test").
The trouble is that I don't run it as often as I should.  I plan to
fix that, but it really needs to run automatically to be reliable - I
can't be trusted to run it when required. :-(
I've taken steps to setting something up to that it does run
automagically every night against various kernels, but there is still
a way to go...
It did catch this raid6 problem when I did run it, but there were a
few other bugs in there that the test suite would not have found
(e.g. one was a memory leak and checking generically for memory leaks
is not trivial).

I'll suggest something when I submit the patches which fix all the
bugs I found (test-suite still running just at the moment).
