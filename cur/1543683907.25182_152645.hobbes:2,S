Thanks for doing this guys.
I wanted to apply this but then I've noticed that it moves
around some config options which are destined to die.
So instead I want to:
- kill CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_MODES (and ide_modes.h)
- kill CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX
- redo your changes in respect to CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE
- use "if BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI ... endif" instead of "depends on"
- use "if IDE_CHIPSETS ... endif" instead of "depends on"
Does it sound sane?  If so I will later post patches for you review.
:-)
