Subject: [patch, 2.5] __vmalloc allocates spurious page?

Hi,
I think __vmalloc allocates an unnecessary page. While the virtual 
address space should have a one-page hole in it, that is taken care of 
by get_vm_area. All other routines (particularly map_vm_area)
subtract PAGE_SIZE from area->size before usage, so the last page 
table entry isn't even set up.
The unnecessary page is allocated only if size is initially a multiple 
of PAGE_SIZE, which sounds like a common case.
