Subject: ide-scsi problems with plextor IDE drive

I've been having some intermittent problems with a brand new plextor IDE
CD-RW drive under linux.  I haven't had any problems reading or writing to
the drive under winDOS 95, nor have I had problems writing to the drive
using cdrecord, but I've had tons of problems reading from the drive (e.g.
mounting a CD).  I'm accessing the drive via ide-scsi emulation.
I'm running 2.2.14 and have tried the latest IDE patch (ide20000124) to
see if that would help, but I still have problems.
Here's what happens when I try to mount a CD:
[root@manteador ~]$ mount -t iso9660 -o ro /dev/scd0 /mnt/cdrom
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/scd0,
       or too many mounted file systems
[root@manteador ~]$ 
Relevant errors from 'dmesg' caused by the mount attempt:
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: PLEXTOR   Model: CD-R   PX-W8432T  Rev: 1.05

Unable to identify CD-ROM format.
/etc/conf.modules relevant contents:
# kernel 2.2.x ATAPI SCSI emulation
options ide-cd ignore=hdc            # if /dev/hdc is your CD-writer
post-install sr_mod /sbin/modprobe ide-scsi # auto probe module 
alias   scd0 sr_mod                  # load sr_mod upon access of scd0
alias   scsi_hostadaptor ide-scsi    # SCSI host adaptor emulation
I need some assistance in determining if this is a hardware problem or a
linux problem so that I can RMA the drive or linux ;-)
If I try to mount the CD using straight ATAPI mode it works just fine
(i.e. /dev/hdc without scsi modules).
Now oddly that I've re-enabled the ide-scsi modules, I can mount cdroms
with no problem.  This doesn't always work.
Perhaps I should enable verbose scsi error reporting...  I'll wait to hear
back from you fine folks first.  Please CC me on replies since I'm not
subscribed.  Tx!
