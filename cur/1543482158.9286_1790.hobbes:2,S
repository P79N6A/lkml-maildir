The ".0" is not good. It is like "Windows NT 4.0, service pack 0".
With "released" in the past tense, this press release is lifeless.
I suggest present tense for the whole thing.

I had to word wrap the above, because the lines got too long.
It would be better to stick to 72 characters.
I like "WAN (wide area network)" better than "wide area network (WAN)".
Think about "wide support for a wide". "256-bit" is better than "(256-bit)".
Feature check:
-  priority traffic  <-- important new QoS queueing stuff
X  usage limits
-  firewalls         <-- much more flexible now
X  accounting
X  virtual private networks
You missed two.
"proprietary protocol network devices" sounds really weird.
It might be best to split off the encryption. I have this:
:   ability to replace many expensive proprietary network devices.
:   Users can take control of their intranet with priority traffic,
:   usage limits, firewalls, accounting, and virtual private networks.
:
: * Strong 256-bit encryption, available as an add-on component
:   uncompromised by US export restrictions. Linux protects both
:   network infrastructure and hard disk storage, including swap space.
If you want that second one as a complete sentence:
   "Linux provides strong [...]"

This fits better in the BACKGROUND section.

Hmmm. Try this:
: * Linux has enterprise-level network filesystem support, with data
:   replication for performance, mobility, and extreme reliability.
:   File server destruction need not and should not stop business.
I still think "complete with" is appropriate.

Except for audio, Linux had no multimedia capabilities before?
I suppose it is mostly true, but we shouldn't imply that it is.
This seems nice:
: * Video conferencing and recording support, TV tuner support,
:  enhanced audio support, and other exciting multimedia enhancements.
Again, if you prefer whole sentences: "Linux 2.2 provides [...]"

Use "High-end", not "High end", but only if you insist.
Try simple terms like "computers with multiple processors" instead of
complicated terms like "symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)".
I hate "performance is significantly enhanced" for some reason.
It is passive voice and seems to parody the typical press release.
Don't ever write "Linux's". Besides violating Linus's trademark rights,
it just doesn't look that good.

Ah, but no NTFS support? Not only that, but Samba is old news.
Samba isn't even part of the kernel. Linux supports some BSD
filesystems, but not many Unix filesystems. (only the old "sysv")
Terms to avoid: "partition", "slice", and "filesystem". Prefer "documents"
over "data". Kill "legacy", since it hurts our credibility. ("upgrade" is
pushing our luck but worth the risk) Avoid "enables $FOO to" constructs.
Good idea:  be buzzword compliant
Bad idea:   make fun of marketing language
If you use the "Windows", you need to credit Microsoft. If you stick to
plain "NT", you can credit Northern Telecom Limited instead.
Try this:
: * Linux allows easy access to documents stored on NTFS-format hard disks.
:   This NT compatibility support provides an upgrade path to Linux.

This was introduced around Linux 0.02, if then.
Don't ever use "modify". Why would anybody want to do that?
Use "customize". Use "every user" rather than "any user".

This is getting _way_ too detailed.

OK, as long as we can really expect that.

Simplify! Kill "distributions" (what are they?), GNU (not fair),
the Alpha and UltraSPARC (huh?), the 386 (long gone), and "Titanic"
(getting old).
Stick to the goal. This document has "designed by committee" all over it.
Oh, so it was designed by committee... Try to hide that!

You forgot IRC, "Ask Slashdot", email, and web-based discussion groups.
The term "Usenet" is kind of dead. Many people know mailing lists as
"email groups". It is better to be vague: "cost-effective Internet groups".

We can't use "UNIX" here. We can't use it anywhere at all.
Only reporters may use the term without prior authorization,
and they still have to be careful about proper use.

[huge list]
That list has got to go. It is growing without bounds. It is full of
sites that aren't really suitable. The list will never be fair.
It looks totally "designed by committee". It must die, die, die!!!
I have personally checked these sites:
    www.Linux.ORG www.uk.Linux.ORG www.LinuxResources.com
They are all generic Linux sites. There isn't much non-Linux crud
or distribution-specific crud on them. They look appealing.

If you have translators, please encourage them to make an approximate
translation that fits their culture. Exactness is of little use.
They should also change the URLs to native-language web sites.
