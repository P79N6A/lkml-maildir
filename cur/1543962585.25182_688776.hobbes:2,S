So, I was wondering if it would be worth while having subsections to a
series file like:
# NEXT_PATCHES_START [<label> [<base>]]
# NEXT_PATCHES_END
With <label> sections being logically separate enough that we can talk
about them/drop them/merge them at different places etc.
Or am I over engineering? :-)

Yeah, I saw that, thanks.
