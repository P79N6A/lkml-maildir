Consider following simple Kconfig:
config A
        bool "a"
config B
        bool "b"
        depends on A
config C
        bool "c"
        select B
config D
        bool "d"
        depends on A
        select B
We should try to coe up with something that warns on
on the select in "config C", because B has dependencies C
does not have.
The select in D is OK since D has at least the same dependencies
as B.
So if we had a expr_is_subset_of(expr *e1, expr *e2)....
Roman - what do you think?
