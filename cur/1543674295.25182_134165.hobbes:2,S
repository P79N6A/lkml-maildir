Hi Jamie!
No, you don't understand (or maybe you were being facetious 8).
A normal futex blocks: ie. you can only have one futex being slept on
per process, so pinning a page is probably fine.
The NGPT guys wanted to allow waiting on more than one futex per
process.  If you want to allow this through *any* mechanism, you have to:
1) Allocate something for each futex.  The normal case uses the stack,
   so never fails.
2) Control the number which can be used at once.
The current implementation needs a tighter #2.
Cheers,
Rusty.
