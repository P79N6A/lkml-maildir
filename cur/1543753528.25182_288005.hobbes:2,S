I've rewritten some CBC code to fit the facilities I introduce in my LRW
patch[1]. Here are the results for my P4@1.8GHZ:
loop-aes, CBC: ~30.5mb/s
dm-crypt, CBC prior to my rewrite: ~23mb/s
dm-crypt, CBC with my LRW patch: ~27mb/s
dm-crypt, LRW with my LRW patch: ~27mb/s (slightly faster than CBC)
As you can see my LRW patches (actually it's the generic scatterwalker
which is part of the LRW patch set) halves the gap to loop-aes. 
I'm sure dm-crypt is never going to achieve the speed of loop-aes.
That's just the price you pay, when you have to do things right and
clean, so they get merged into main. Kernel developers are choosey
customers, you know.
