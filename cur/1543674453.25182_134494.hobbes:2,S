Ok, that's fine with me.  A bit of documentation for all of this might
be nice.  Just add some kerneldoc comments to your public functions, and
you should be fine.

You could do something like what has been done for the mii module.  Look
at lib/Makefile and drivers/usb/net/Makefile.mii for an example.
I'm not saying that this is the best way, but it could be one solution.
Ideally, the user would never have to select the firmware core option,
it would just get automatically built if a driver that needs it is also
selected.

The patches look great.  Add a bit of documentation, and some build
integration, and I'd think you are finished.  Unless anyone else has any
objections?
Very nice job, thanks again for doing this.
