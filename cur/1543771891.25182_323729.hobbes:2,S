Subject: [PATCH] [RESENT] Fix Oops in IPMI with acpi=off|ht : ipmi_si_intf-acpi-disabled
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[The patch was dropped in 2.6.12-rc5-mm2 with bk-acpi although it
wasn't related to it.
This patch is rediffed against 2.6.12-rc6, please apply]
This patch fix ipmi_si_intf to not use ACPI tables if the ACPI
subsystem is disabled, removing a Oops in ACPI layer (which is really
fixed by a previous patch sent by me but not confirmed by ACPI team).
