Subject: [patch 3/9] drive->dsc_overlap fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/3/326

drive->dsc_overlap is supported only by ide-{cd,tape} drivers.
Add missing clearing of ->dsc_overlap to ide_{cd,tape}_release()
and move ->dsc_overlap setup from ide_register_subdriver() to
ide_cdrom_setup() (ide-tape enables it unconditionally).
