IIRC, that was the case for HP-UX 9.x. I'm not sure for 10.20, especially
with the introduction of the NFSv3 stuff (but I expect that it is - it
used to use the old Sun automount, but has since been replaced with AutoFS,
CacheFS, etc).

That works fine - we mainly still use 2.2.5, but 2.2.11 was also fine.
I haven't tried serving from Linux to HP-UX.
