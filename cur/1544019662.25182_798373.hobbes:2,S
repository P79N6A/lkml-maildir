I think staging is great activity, but I also think it is no good idea 
for kernel core piece.

The fact is simple more. if auther refuse to receive reviewing,
the code don't clean up at all, don't fix up at all.
then, dropping is better.

Again, I respect for your drivers/staging activity largely.
then, I don't oppose any driver merge to staging.
but I don't think driver/staging is good place for non driver code.
The problem is, any patch must be reviewed by stakeholder, not maintenar only.
then, the patch should post lkml and subsystem mailing list at first.
I like reviewed code than unreviewed code.
