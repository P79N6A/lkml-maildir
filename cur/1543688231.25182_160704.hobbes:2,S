Thanks, that did the trick.  Seems this "no root" stuff
didn't realize that I want a root after all.

There is more than one way to specify a root, it seems.  I never
set any numbers for my root, I use the root=/dev/md/0 parameter
to the kernel.  I don't have any initramfs.
Why don't those who want to keep an initramfs simply
specify root=/dev/root which don't need extra parsing?
