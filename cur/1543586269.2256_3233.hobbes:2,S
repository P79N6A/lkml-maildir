Hello EveryBody,
I have a COMPAQ ML570 (2xPIII-700Mhz/1MBytes Cache, 2 x NCR SCSI controller, 
1 SMART ARRAY 5304 (128 MBytes Cache). I test with linux 2.4.2-ac20, and all 
disks, CPU's and memory have been detected by the KERNEL.
See your BIOS Version, My COMPAQ has BIOS P20 01/21/2001, I download from 
compaq.com
Best Regards
André Margis
