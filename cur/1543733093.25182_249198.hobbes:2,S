Did you compile SCSI CD-ROM support? If you did try loading sr_mod. Works 
fine here, just don't forget to rmmod sr_mod before turning off the DVD
as it seems that there is a problem with hot removal either in sr_mod or
in firewire system (I am inclned to say its sr_mod as sd_mod seems to
handle surprise removal OK).
