The alternative, of course, is to compile to an .s file and insert
.code16gcc into the .s file.  This makes the Makefile uglier, but would
be more resilient against oddball gcc changes.
I'm a bit surprised about the claim w.r.t. -fno-unit-at-a-time (although
I guess that is the default and one would thus typically not see this.)
 Got any pointers why that would cause a global asm() to be scrambled
around?
