I believe that gcc/egcc are buggy here - your code _should_ be legal.
Also, whatever version of g++ you are using is _also_ buggy - it should be
generating code to produce 1, not 2, but it is not.

The _expression_ is correct - the _compiler_ is buggy.

I understand how ?: works.  What I said was that gcc/egcc would not compile
this line:
   x = (y) ? x = 1 : x = 2;
But if you change it like this:
   x = (y) ? (x = 1) : (x = 2);
then gcc/egcc don't give you an error.  Try the same workaround in your own
compiler, or upgrade it.
