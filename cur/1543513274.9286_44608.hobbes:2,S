What can I say? Me too.
It is not a hardware restriction, probably just a historical accident.
At some point in the distant past, the card microcode did use the top
one or two bits of addresses for its own purposes. However, this was
sensibly fixed when it caused problems with tests on large-memory
machines.
The card contains a bridge chip (PLX) which can be programmed to map a
window into the host's PCI address space. Unfortunately, this feature
is used in the boot loader (presumably for convenience). The microcode
is trying to read a command block from host memory but the read access
never gets through the PLX (I have checked with a logic analyser).

DMA is completely unaffected in this respect. The PLX only maps direct
reads from and writes to the memory space on the other side. I believe
that the microcode turns off the window and uses DMA exclusively (also
handled by the PLX).

I haven't found anything obvious under drivers/sound.
