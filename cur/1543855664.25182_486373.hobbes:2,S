FYI.
With some help from Keith Owens, we've determined that gcc 3.3.5
resulted in XFS stack usage of about 1.9KB through the writeback and
allocation path with another ~800 bytes of stack usage in generic
code in this path.
The big difference between the numbers I was getting from checkstack
and reality was CONFIG_CC_OPTIMISE_FOR_SIZE=y being set on the
kernels I was stack checking. IOWs, CONFIG_CC_OPTIMISE_FOR_SIZE=y
appears to reduce XFS stack usage by at least 20% and so probably
should be used with XFS on 4k stacks.
Keith also confirmed that gcc-4.1's aggressive inlining of static
functions substantially increases stack usage (by ~15%) through this
call chain.  Given that many of the inlined static functions are not
required by the critical path (i.e. they'd previously been factored
out to reduce stack usage), gcc is effectively undoing past mods
that had substantially reduced XFS's stack usage.
Cheers,
Dave.
