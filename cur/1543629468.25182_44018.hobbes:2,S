Hi folks.
[Sorry if this is considered noise here.]
I would like to know if current 2.4 kernels support the goodies in the new
powerbook G4 (the gigabit ethernet card, the firewire and usb ports, the
airport card etc).
I would like to buy one, but first make sure I can happily use linux on
it. Does anyone have closer experience?
Thanks,
