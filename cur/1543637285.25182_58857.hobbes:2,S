Alan,
2.4.19-rc3-ac1 hangs on boot on my laptop (Fujitsu P-series, TM5800
CPU), whereas plain[1] rc3 boots fine.  The hang appears to be during IDE
detection:
...
block: 704 slots per queue, batch=176
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=XX
ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:0f.0. Please try using pci=biosirq
ALI15X3: chipset revision 195
ALI15X3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
With rc-3, I get this same error unless I have 'ide0=ata66 ide1=ata66'
on the kernel command line.  However, -ac1 hangs with or without these
options.
[1] Actually, two one-liner patches... one to extend the ext3 journal
commit interval to 30 seconds, and another to fix suspend issues in
sound/trident.c.
