Torsten,
thanks, here is my strace related to tpm:
open("/dev/tpm", O_RDWR)                = -1 ENODEV
(No such device)
write(2, "Can\'t open TPM Driver\n", 22Can't open TPM
Driver
) = 22
I also inserted some printk in tpm.c and tpm_nsc.c
(tpm_atmel.c as well). I only saw "init_tpm" be
called.  "tpm_open" was not even called!
This machine (IBM thinkcenter S51) has a TPM
(confirmed by IBM support and its own specs). So, the
only possible problem is the driver. Any idea?
thanks a lot,
Gang
