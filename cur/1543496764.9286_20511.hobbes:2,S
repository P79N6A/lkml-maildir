1) Andrea noticed that 'unlock_kernel()' only releases the kernel lock
if the lock was obtained once.
He added two new functions: one stores the current lock depth,
releases the lock and sets current->lock_depth =-1.
The other reverses that.
I think we need these functions:
* it's save to call the functions without the kernel_lock held.
* the unlock is effective for recursive calls.
2) Here's a excerpt from an email I wrote a few days ago:

I didn't use NFS, knfsd, other fs except ext2.
