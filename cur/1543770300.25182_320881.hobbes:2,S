You're right.  I even signed off on your change.
Andrew,
    Drop my "cpuset rmdir scheduling while atomic fix" patch. 
    Dinakar's dynamic-sched-domains-cpuset-changes.patch fixed it.
Dinakar's change wasn't quite the same as mine.  It is actually the
better of the two - it reduces the dentry spinlock region, instead of
moving the cpuset_sem region outside the spinlock.  I just ran my stress
test that shows this bug.  Dinakar's fix is fine, as expected.
