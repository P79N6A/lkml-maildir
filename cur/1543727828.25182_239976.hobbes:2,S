Yes. However, I don't see that the kernel really would ask for new keys 
very often.  Any normal operation is that you have the key already.

The fileserver generally is the one that _asks_ for keys, not the other 
way around.
So the "I don't have a key" case is more of an issue where somebody tries 
to mount an encrypted filesystem, and the filesystem says "you don't have 
a key".
It's not a thing like "you tried to open a file" that happens thousands of
times a second - that one would get an EACCES if you don't have a key. 
It would be more like "the mount binary needs a key to mount this volume, 
so let's request that key first".
David, have you actually coded up something that uses the user callback, 
maybe you can describe a realistic schenario...
But at least to me, the /sbin/request-key thing is more like loading a 
module. You might do it to mount a filesystem or read an encrypted volume, 
but you wouldn't do it in the "normal" workload. It's a major event.
