What other evets/usages does this device support?

No but it could be added.

Ah, OK.

It may be a HID-class device but it is definetly not an input device
and it would be wrong to present it to userspace as a device having 2
LEDs on it - it would be a lie. If we did that then some application
might mistake the device for something else and decide to switch that
LED off thus turning your KVM off. A random application should not be
aware how a random vendor decided to interpret the specs.
