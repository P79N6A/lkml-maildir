I have been having the same problem with a AC32500.  My hdparm -i is as follows:
--
 Model=WDC AC32500H, FwRev=24.09P07, SerialNo=WD-WT334
 Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec SpinMotCtl Fixed DTR>5Mbs FmtGapReq }
 RawCHS=4960/16/63, TrkSize=57600, SectSize=600, ECCbytes=22
 BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=128kB, MaxMultSect=16, MultSect=off
 DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=0(slow)
 CurCHS=620/128/63, CurSects=4999680, LBA=yes, LBAsects=4999680
 tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 *mword2
 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:160,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4

(DMA is listed as "yes" because I turned it on using hdparm after determining
that it didn't need the firmware upgrade, as reported by the WD upgrade program
you referenced.)  I guess this is one you can add to your "good" list.
Thanks,
Kyle
