That BUG means lock->magic was not set properly, which is a debug-only
parameter to make sure the lock was properly initialized.
Thus, either you are not properly initializing your spin_locks or there
is a memory corruption problem.
The EIP at the time of the BUG should of been reported - what was it? 
Find it in your System.map to see where the problem is ...
