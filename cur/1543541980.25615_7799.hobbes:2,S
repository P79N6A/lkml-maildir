After struggling with this problem for a while in my general archive
tree, I threw up my hands and created a bunch of symlinks. What about
something like this:
arch/net -> net/arch
That way you can work with your source where you want it and random
people looking for stuff will also tend to find it... that is the
symlinks serve as nothing more than reminders for people updating
particular sections of the kernel...
