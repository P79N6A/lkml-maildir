Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Preempt realtime Oops syslog
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/15/567

Add bust_spinlocks when kernel die from do_trap to flush Oops
dump to syslog immediatly. Oops is missing from syslog if it is from
non-preemptible section, because on PREEMPT_RT kernel, Oops printk
doesn't wake up klogd from non-preemptible context; see
release_console_sem in kernel/printk.c. 
Tested by Oops in module_init and insmod that kernel module. The
Oops is in non-preemptive context because modules are loaded from 
inside a realtime priority thread in a preemptive realtime kernel. 
Only apply to PPC arch because bust_spinlocks has already been used 
by x86 and other architectures
