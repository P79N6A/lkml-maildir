I would rather try to merge 8250_early and early_printk.
"console=uart,io,0x3f8" is already pretty similar to
"earlyprintk=serial", and it would be nice to have only one.
"console=uart" does have the disadvantage that you have to know the
port address.  But it has the advantage that it doesn't depend on
compiled-in legacy serial port names.  If you need early console
output, you're probably a developer and can come up with the address.
I think it would be nice to have a "console=vga".  That could use
the current "earlyprintk=vga" implementation, and automatically
hand off to tty0.
Then we could remove "earlyprintk=" and always use "console=uart"
or "console=vga".
