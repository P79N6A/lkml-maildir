You can get a copy, it would be interesting to know how JFS/XFS does.

It varies a bit bitween versions, but at least e2fsck has regression
test suite... I had nasty e2 corruption in past (suspend wrote 0 onto
strategic place in bitmaps) where it put filesystem in self-destruct
mode. e2fsck reported fixing the corruption, but did not really fix
it... e2fsck was fixed in the meantime.
(I also have way to corrupt ext2 in a way that basically can't be
repaired automatically. Deallocating free block bitmap and putting
data in freed space is an evil way to corrupt filesystem).
