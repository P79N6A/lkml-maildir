I've seen something similar with my setup.
eth0: 3c509?    private network 192.168.x.x
eth1: 3c509-TPO Connected to cable modem (Road Runner)
No routing, forwarding, or address translation between networks.
May be related: I noticed that about the time I start having these problems, I
seem to get fifo errors on the interface.  Looking at /proc/net/dev (reformated
so it doesn't have to wrap in the mail):
Inter-|   Receive                                                |

I also noticed that the ping times (for me) seem to be a multiple of 1000 + a
small number of milliseconds.
Looking through dev_do_watchdog (in linux/net/sched/sch_generic.c) I noticed
that the watchdog expires in 5*HZ.  If for some reason either the card stopped
interrupting, or the driver got confused, could you have something like this? :
software sends ping
500 ms later watchdog sends packet
500 ms later watchdog receives reply
ping responds with 1000+ time.
If this is the case, does anyone know if there is a way for the busy flags to
get out of sync, or a way to reset the card without downing & uping the
interface to debug this?  Or any other ideas (or other possible problems?)
Thanks for any help you can give me.
