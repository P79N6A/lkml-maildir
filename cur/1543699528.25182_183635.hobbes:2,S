2.4.24-pre1 now contains the bulk of the XFS code.  These split patches
only contain XFS updates from 2.4.24-pre1, plus add on code such as
ACL, DMAPI and KDB.  If you do not need those features and you are not
seeing any bugs in the base 2.4.24-pre1 XFS code then you do not need
to apply any of these patches.
Read the README in each directory very carefully, the split patch
format has changed over a few kernel releases.  Any questions that are
covered by the README will be ignored.  There is even a 2.4.24/README
for the terminally impatient :).
