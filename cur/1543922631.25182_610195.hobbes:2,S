The kexec issue is solved as that of IA-64. The EFI runtime code and
data memory area is mapped with identity mapping, so they will have same
virtual address across kexec. The memory mapped IO memory area used by
EFI runtime services is mapped with fixmap, so they will have same
virtual address across kexec too. And the efi_set_virtual_address_map
runtime service function will be skipped in the kexeced kernel (set to
"nop" in /sbin/kexec). So the kexeced kernel can use the virtual mode of
EFI from kernel bootstrap on.
