Hi,
I've a mysterious problem with Linux kernels on a production system.
The box is a web frontend machine and the problem is that after a
couple of days of running one of httpd process "sticks" in.  Commands
w, ps and their friends usually hang after this case.  I cannot stat
the files under /proc/<PID-of-this-httpd-process>/, so I think this
should be a kernel-related problem.  Only the reboot helps.
I tried out a lot of kernel versions: 2.4.10, 2.4.19, 2.4.19rmap14b
(the last one with the new procfs code), but these didn't help.
Any idea?
