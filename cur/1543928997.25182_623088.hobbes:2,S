Subject: capabilities-introduce-per-process-capability-bounding-set.patch breaks FC6 Avahi
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

avahi-daemon fails to start on FC6 when
capabilities-introduce-per-process-capability-bounding-set.patch is
applied.
strace shows
	capset(0x19980330, 0, {CAP_SETGID|CAP_SETUID|CAP_SYS_CHROOT, CAP_SETGID|CAP_SETUID|CAP_SYS_CHROOT, 0}) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
I don't know if this is expected, but the changelog doesn't seem to
imply that this will break things.
