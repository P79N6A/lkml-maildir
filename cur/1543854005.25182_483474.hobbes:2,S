I'm not certain, but I think that this is an unrelated issue. Both the 
working kernel and the failing kernels quirk the device in the same way:
PCI: VIA IRQ fixup for 0000:00:0f.0, from 11 to 2
Both the working kernel (2.6.17-gentoo-r8) and the first failing kernel 
(2.6.18-gentoo) have the same patch for 'fixing' the quirk issues: 
Chris's changes were reverted, the VIA IRQ quirk was back in the 2.6.16 
state. Since then the same issues have been observed with unpatched 
2.6.19-rc.
This is not definitive but suggests the issue is elsewhere.
