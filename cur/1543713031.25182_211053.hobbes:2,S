Does the device perform translation internally to pretend to be a block
device, or does the host access the flash directly and perform the
translation itself?
If the translation is done by the host, it sounds like your flash
controller should be implemented as an MTD device. There is a set of
helpers to allow a translation layer to be implemented simply -- see the
ftl, nftl and inftl code in the 2.6 kernel for examples.
