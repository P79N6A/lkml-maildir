Hi,
http://www.kerneltrap.org/~npiggin/v17/
Still working on SMP and NUMA. Some (maybe) interesting things I put in are
- Sequential CPU balancing so you don't get a big storm of balances 
every 1/4s.
- Balancing is trying to err more on the side of caution, I have to start
  analysing it more thoroughly though.
- Attacked the NUMA balancing code. There should now be less buslocked ops /
  cache pingpongs in some fastpaths. Volanomark likes it, more realistic 
loads
  won't improve so much

  This improvement is NUMA only.
I haven't had time to reproduce Cliff's serious reaim performance 
dropoffs so
they're probably still there. I couldn't reproduce Martin's kernbench 
dropoff,
but the 16-way I'm using only has 512K cache which might not show it up.
