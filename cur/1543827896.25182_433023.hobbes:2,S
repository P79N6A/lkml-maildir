We already do this.  The original questions were related to whether
i_blksize and i_blkbits need to be per-inode or per-filesystem, and
thats what I was trying to answer...

|   of per-filesystem?
| 2) Move i_blkbits (blocksize for doing direct I/O in bits) to struct
|    super.  Again, why is this per-inode?
As to whether a new inode operation is useful/needed - *shrug* - not
really my call, I was saying we can work with whatever ends up being
the final solution, provided it keeps per-inode granularity.
cheers.
