It's at least not as bad as the current hack (when properly done in
the capabilities modules instead of adding one ontop).
I must say I'm not exactly happy with that idea still.  It ties the
privilegues we have been separating from a special uid (0) to filesystem
permissions again.  It's not nessecarily a bad idea per, but it doesn't
really fit into the model we've been working to.  I'd expect quite a few
unpleasant devices when a user detects that the distibution had been
binding various capabilities to uids/gids behinds his back.
So to make forward progress I'd like the audio people to confirm whether
the mlock bits in 2.6.9+ do help that half of their requirement first
(and if not find a way to fix it) and then tackle the scheduling part.
For that one I really wonder whether the combination of the now actually
working nicelevels (see Mingo's post) and a simple wrapper for the really
high requirements cases doesn't work.
