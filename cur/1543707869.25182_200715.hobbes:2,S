select's behaviour is fun when trying to do smooth game animation on
X...  Humans are pretty good at noticing jitter in the animation of a
moving object.  Years ago, I ended up writing an estimator which
deduced the granularity and rounding of select(), so that I could then
_reduce_ the timeout given to select() followed by a busy wait up to
the desired time.  That was needed for SunOS.  Nowadays with 1kHz
jiffies it's not a problem, but not all systems have that.
So, I agree, the change might break current apps.
If the current behaviour is retained, shouldn't select(), poll() and
epoll() at least agree on the same rounding direction?  poll/epoll
should be suitable as replacements for select, but I don't think they
are timing-wise.
(Btw, Bill, did you take a look at epoll too?)
