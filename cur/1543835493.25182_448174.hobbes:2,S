I don't like "double ESC" idea at all.
I am a Midnight Commander user and I use "old ESC mode"
where single ESC works after a delay.
I patched mc to look at KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US environment variable 
so that delay is configurable (instead of hardcoded 0.5 second one).
Will push the patch to mc-devel.
25 millisecond timeout works just fine on local ttys, serial lines,
and over ssh. So I am setting KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US=25000.
