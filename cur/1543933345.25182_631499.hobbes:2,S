I noticed you also have a spinlock held in usu_probe_thread(), the
usu_lock.. That spinlock would preclude anything inside request_module()
from sleeping..
One thing that has bothered me is that I don't see a reason why this
couldn't become a complete, yet you have a comment which says that it
can't be a complete.. I honestly didn't understand the comment.. I would
imagine that you tried a complete , and it didn't work?

Great, thanks ..
