It's not even about SMP. "byte" and "short" are not IRQ-safe or even 
preemption-safe (although I guess alpha doesn't support CONFIG_PREEMPT 
right now anyway) on pre-byte-access alphas.
Just don't do it. Maybe we'll never see another chip try what alpha did 
(it was arguably the single biggest mistake the early alphas had, and 
caused tons of system design trouble), but just use an "int".
That said, I'd suggest putting it in the thread structure instead. We 
already have thread-safe flags there, just use one of the bits. Yes, 
you'll need to use locked accesses to set it, but hey, how often does 
something like this get set anyway? And then you just do ti _right_, using 
set_thread_flag/clear_thread_flag etc..
