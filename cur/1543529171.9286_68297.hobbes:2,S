No. I wasn't. Of make oldconfig, config, menuconfig, xconfig, it was the
only one that would wite a .config on 2.3.44 at least, straight "out
of the box". The rest wouldn't write a EXT2_FS entry, possibly because of
a broken other fs section somewhere close above. I thought you were all
using xconfig.
