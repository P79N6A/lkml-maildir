This would be *very* expensive to do.  More likely, you would want to
have a pool of threads already spun which would select on several
descriptors.  That way you could take advantage of multiproccessor
systems and the benefits of threads without the overhead of spawning a
new thread for every connection which could get huge on a big server.
