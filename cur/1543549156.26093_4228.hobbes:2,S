    Historical.  SCSI was made modular very early on when the modules
technology was pretty primative.  As time has gone on, the two
initialization paths have converged, and now they are essentially redundant.
    The one thing that is different in the module/non-module case is for the
case of SCSI compiled into the kernel, you need to look at the list of
compiled-in host adapters.  Unless of course you are cleaning that up as
well.  I haven't seen the threads that got this work started, and it is only
in reading this morning's messages that I see the rationale for all these
changes in the first place.  There are a couple of ways of addressing this,
some better than others, and some are more work than others.  I can give you
assistance and ideas if you want.
