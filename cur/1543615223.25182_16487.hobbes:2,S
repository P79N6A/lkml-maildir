 two points. First for clarification - do you see the effects also on
elapsed time? Or do you say that the CPU time reporting is screwed?
 Second - you mention that you see the effect mainly on linear algebra
stuff. Could it be that you are memory bandwidth limited if you run two
of them together? Are you using Intel CPUs (my guess) which have the FSB
concept that may make memory bandwidth scaling a problem, or AMD Athlons
which use the Alpha/EV6 bus and should be a bit more friendly.
 Finally, how big is "1/10th of physical" memory? What kind of memory.
