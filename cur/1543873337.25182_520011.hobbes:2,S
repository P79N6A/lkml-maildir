Subject: [BUG: kernel/irq/proc.c] unprotected iteration over the IRQ action list in name_unique()

Hi,
1-st issue:  unprotected iteration over the IRQ action list in name_unique()
the racing sequences:
[ 1 ]  request_irq() -> setup_irq() -> register_handler_proc() ->
name_unique() -> iterate over the action list (*)
setup_irq() releases a desc->lock before calling register_handler_proc().
[ 2 ]  free_irq() -> delete some element while (*) is still in progress -> bum!
something like this should make it safe :

+++ kernel/irq/proc.c   2007-03-14 16:59:47.236950000 +0100

 {
        struct irq_desc *desc = irq_desc + irq;

                        return 0;
+               }

+       spin_unlock_irqrestore(&desc->lock, flags);
        return 1;
 }
2-nd issue:  now it's about register_irq_proc() which is also called
by setup_irq().
register_irq_proc() is called for all descriptors for which
(irq_desc[irq].chip == &no_irq_chip) != 0           (*)
at startup time from init_irq_proc().
Let's suppose (*) is not true for some desc at startup and changes at
some point later.
If so, register_irq_proc() takes effect being called from setup_irq().
Now let's suppose request_irq() is called on 2 cpus for the same
interrupt line and both end up in (%) below
[ request_irq() -> setup_irq() -> register_irq_proc() ]
void register_irq_proc(unsigned int irq)
{
        char name [MAX_NAMELEN];
        if (!root_irq_dir ||
                (irq_desc[irq].chip == &no_irq_chip) ||
                        irq_desc[irq].dir)
                return;
            (%)  <=== both are here
        memset(name, 0, MAX_NAMELEN);
        sprintf(name, "%d", irq);
        /* create /proc/irq/1234 */
        irq_desc[irq].dir = proc_mkdir(name, root_irq_dir);
...
Both will try to initialize "irq_desc[irq].dir" and "smp_affinity"
entry... Not bum, but a possible leak indeed.
TIA,
