Fundamentally, these locks are fast because they *don't* tell the kernel.
Also, if you die with a lock, "autocleaning" it is often far worse then
just locking up, since the data it was protecting may be inconcsistant.
At the end of the day, this is the place for an application-specific
answer.  And this is nothing that can't be done in userspace (ie. if
you can't get the lock for some length of time, notify the lock master
and it will do all the cleanups and release the lock).
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
