Unfortunately any code like this
	if (a)
		b = 99;
generates conditional move (cmove) instructions on 686.  In vsprintf.c
there are several of these constructs, in particular strnlen generates
it.  So printk("%s", text) tends to fault as well.  Some people have
argued that critical routines should always be compiled with -i386,
unfortunately that includes all of printk and all console handling
(both serial and screen), not really an option.
If anything is going to detect the mismatch and complain, it has to be
the boot loader, after uncompressing and before entering the kernel
proper.
