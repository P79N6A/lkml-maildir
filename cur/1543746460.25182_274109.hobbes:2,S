Something like the following? I can bring the interface up and down
without locks now.
I introduced the smc_phy_configure_wq() wrapper for the workqueue call
because smc_phy_configure is also called directly from a couple of
places -- I guess I could also have prefixed both of those calls with a
dev_hold() or punted both to the workqueue but this way seems nicest.
