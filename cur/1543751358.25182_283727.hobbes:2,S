In this case, the patch was taken from 2.6.9-mm.
Whilst it's not officially 'upstream', and things do occasionally
get merged there that don't move to Linus' tree, this one was
chosen on the merits that it was a useful feature worthy of inclusion.
Quite a few features have been beaten out this way.
Ext3 reservations, 4K stacks to name two off the top of my head.
All these have had exposure in Fedora testing trees which has turned
up bugs no-one saw when they were in -mm. Had they not gotten
that exposure, those features may have never got to where they
are today.
The odd part is.. this patch was included in our 2.6.8 tree
without problems. It also didn't cause problems for everyone
when it was in -mm (though some did see the same bug).
Spooky.

Thanks.  Had I not already dropped this when I updated our tree to 2.6.10,
this would have been useful.
