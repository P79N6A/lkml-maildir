Tried. Nothing changes with this patch. I'm booting the patched kernel
commenting out the unicode_start line for now, and there aren't other
"system" problems.
I confirm the behavior previously posted for the serial devices on
flush with this patch too.
"With the patch, flushing the input results effectively in a complete flush.
However after doing the flush I can't read [further] chars [sent to
the serial port]
without closing and reopening the port. I've verified this behavior both
communicating between two serial ports and both communicating with an
usb-serial device (driver cdc-acm)."
