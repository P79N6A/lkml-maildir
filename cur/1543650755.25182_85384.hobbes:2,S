ext3 has some SMP scalability problems.  The BKL is used to protect many
journal operations, and we see huge amounts of CPU spent spinning on it
on 4/8/16 proc machines.  So much CPU, that it masks anything else we're
doing on the system.  But, on a single-proc or just a 2-way, you
probably won't see much of this to be significant.  
We haven't tested reiser extensively here, but from what I've seen it
scales much, much better than ext3 (as does jfs and probably xfs too).
