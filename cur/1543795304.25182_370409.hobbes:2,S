Possible, but if you are draining, it's just as handy to drain them all

That will only delay the problem. Pages end up on the per-cpu lists from
either an allocation or a free. While the allocation would make sure the
pages were contiguous and on the same list, the frees will not. The test
case you are running is a tight loop of one process allocating and freeing
order-1 pages. This is probably staying on the one CPU so draining in
batches on just the local CPU will appear successful. On long lived loads,
it will not be as successful. Draining all the pages on all lists would
cover all cases while using the existing code.
When I was testing my version of drain-percpu for anti-defrag and order-10
allocations, I found that draining just the local CPU made little
difference but draining all of them made a massive difference. This is an
extreme case, but it still applies to the smaller orders.

Measure it by counting how often you drain the pages and add it to
frag_show(). This is a hack obviously and not a permanent solution, but
it's the easiest way to find out what's going on.

Depends on if your workload involves one or more processes. If the load is
multiple processes on multiple CPUs, the per-cpu pages will be spread out
a lot.

If CIFS still needs high order allocations, you could try -jN kernel
compiles over the network filesystem. Network benchmarks running over a
loopback device with a large MTU while another load consumes memory might
also trigger it.
