Ok, Chris Wright pointed me to the justification: it was because on 64G 
powerpc machines, MAX_ORDER of 11 was too small to allocate sufficient 
hashes.
See 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/old-2.6-bkcvs.git;a=commitdiff;h=50c2cb5183e4f101f923212e39a58a66a530cf77
Since MAX_ORDER is now 13 on powerpc, I think we're good.
Thanks Cdub!
