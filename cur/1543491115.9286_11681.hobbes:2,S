I have to thank Mike Galbraith who forwarded me a mail where I seen that
also Riccardo is currently not receiving linux-kernel.
So basically this is only a "me too" ;).

Subject: kernel list stopped here please help
I stopped receiving messages from linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu since two
days ago, the last message I received is this:
	894 Mar 25 David Whysong       (4,443) SCSI errors
I also tried to resubscribe but no-reply.
Can you give me some hint to fix the list problem?
