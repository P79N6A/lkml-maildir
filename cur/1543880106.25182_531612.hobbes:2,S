Makes sense.

So, now we have two locks protecting cache_chain? Please explain why
you can't use the mutex.

Considering you're doing this at out_of_memory() time, wouldn't it
make more sense to add a ->nr_pages to struct kmem_cache and do the
tracking in kmem_getpages/kmem_freepages?
I would also drop the OFF_SLAB bits because it really doesn't matter
that much for your purposes. Besides, you're already per-node and
per-CPU caches here which attribute to much more memory on NUMA setups
for example.
