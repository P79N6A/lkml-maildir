I just use two trees (linux.vanilla, and linux.new)
	diff -urN linux.vanilla linux.new >linux.new.diff

Yes it should..
Every line in the new file will appear in the diff file with a +
before it.
> 	-Does a patch made for version X will apply on version Y ?
If the file(s) you patched haven't changed, they will apply.
If they have only slightly changed, they will in most cases
still apply (with offsets)
If they have undergone quite drastic changes, chances are
your patch will need re-applying by hand, and then re-diff'd.
regards,
Dave.
