I think this is yet another example of the fragile mess that is UID
emulation with capabilities. Your patch is an example of privilege
escalation - luser can kill a more-capable process. In the kill CONT
case we reached the opposite conclusion to this one. As was the case
then, I didn't disagree then :*). If it meets folk's expectations, then
this is probably a good patch...

Its late and I'm obviously tired, but is there any reason not to simply use:
 if (p->uid == current->uid)
	 return 0;
Whatever the case, could you put the new code closer to the sig ==
SIGCONT test? The capability tests are at the end of cap_task_kill() and
this new check breaks that pattern.
Cheers
