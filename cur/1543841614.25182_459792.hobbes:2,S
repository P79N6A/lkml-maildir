It appears to be undocumented and uncommented hence it's not an API
_at all_, is it?
What's __raw_writeq() supposed to do, anyway?  On alpha it's writeq()
without an mb().  On parisc it's writeq() only the data is byte-reversed. 
On sparc64() it's incomprehensible.  On everything else it's writeq().
What a crock.
