That explains why adding the fourport module fixed Rob's issue, as the
fourport code sets a uartclk value for its ports.

Would it be more intuitive to give ports the default uartclk of
1843200 at init time? That would avoid this issue, but would make the
baud rates come out wrong on hardware with a non-standard clock, if a
base baud wasn't specified.
