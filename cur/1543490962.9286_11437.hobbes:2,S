Whoa, hold on - kmod does not get involved in module removal (since about
2.1.10x) - check Documentation/kmod.txt - if you're not running something
in the background like the appropriate cron job, you're not removing
modules.
Anyway, can we also get the output of /sbin/lsmod here, and the output of

Looking at the setup of my machine, I think I may see the problem -
block-major-8 is the scsi-disk device.  If you have unloaded ppa, but have
not unloaded sd, then I could see this problem arising.
I have a couple of ideas of approaches to fixing the problem, but I'd like
to hear what the output  requested above looks like.
