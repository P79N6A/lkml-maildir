I'm using transparent proxy to redirect ports 8000-8799 on my box to other
ports. (it's to help folks get around port filters)
I need to know these ports are marked as used or not by the kernel, or if
there's a way to do this -- specificly, I'd like to avoid a user process
from accidentally getting stuck with one of those ports when trying to make
an outgoing connection or dynamicly assigned listening port (like an IRC
DCC).
