I'll accept extents - the "segment" reference was wrong.

Definitely different. RAD50 was used in FILES-11 and RT-11 disks. It was used
to store 3 characters in a 16 bit word. SIXBIT was used on TOPS-10 36bit
systems to store 6 characters in a word. It also allowed for a fast file
name search since the names were all on word boundaries (full filename
compair took 2 compair, and 1 mask operation 6+3 file names).

Still got the manuals ? :-)
