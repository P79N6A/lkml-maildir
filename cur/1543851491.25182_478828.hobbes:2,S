Jens, Andrew,
I am not pursueing this patch set. I have convinced myself that blktrace
is capable of being used as a an analysis tool for low level I/O
performance, if invoced with appropriate settings. In our tests, we
limited traces to Issue/Complete events, cut down on relay buffers, and
redirected traces to a network connection instead of filling locally
attached storage up. Cost is about 2 percent, as advertised.
Thanks,
Martin
