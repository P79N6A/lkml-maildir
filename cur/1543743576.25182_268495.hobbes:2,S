Oh, are you talking about the output of getprocattr?  Perhaps the output
should (temporarily) be default list the selinux info on the first line,
without a "selinux: " prepended, and list any other modules after?
Or do you mean something else?
You mentioned a common LSM sysfs framework.  Does it offer support for
both per-module and per-pid-per-module files?  If so, then I suppose it
would be fair to force LSMs to use those, and reserve the existing
{gs}etprocattr files for selinux use (or nuke them).
