We have been discussing passing an opaque value into request_irq like
sparc64 does. It could be a pointer to the irq descriptor. rmk was
interested in it since he can have heavily nested interrupt controllers
and partitioning the NR_IRQS space is a pain in this case.
This will work on 32bit archs since we store irqs as ints everywhere, but
will break on 64bit unless we do some tricks (like sparc64 is currently
doing)
