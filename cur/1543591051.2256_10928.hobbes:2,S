I saw them before. However, in my case they were obviously the result of 2
consecutive 32-byte errors, as the latter occurred many more times.
I never saw an offset different from the block size, though.
Assuming you did have 32-byte errors, you had 7 errors for 1.3 GB.
I have approx. 6 errors for 256 MB. But I have only 128 MB RAM.
