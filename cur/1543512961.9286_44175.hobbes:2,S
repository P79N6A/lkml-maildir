This is just a simple question of mine. Creative have made it clear they are not 
going to give out source or data sheets to the emu10k. That sucks already but I 
am really wondering why they couldn't. They claim that they'll have to give the 
firmware out also and that's soemthing they can't do.
Ok.
First off does firmware have to be in some human readable form? Can't it just be 
something that you shove into the DSP before you start playing sounds with it?
Second if the firmware can be in some human unreadable form that why would 
creative have any problem with a OpenSource driver? All the Opensource guy will 
know is that he gives the card this and that after uploading the firmware and 
click we have ourselves a sblive.
Finially if no one minds here ... how do i make use of the two dsp device the 
current creative 0.3 drivers provides? They call it /dev/dsp and /dev/dsp1.
Thanks loads..!
