I understood (or misunderstood)  Mr. Cox notes that when a new thread
is created, scheduler  goes through all existing threads and changes
their time slice / priority , in order to accomodate a new thread in a 
fair manner.  I do not know what Mr. Ingo suggested, but what I
learned from reading various CPU cookbooks is that most CPU's or MMU's 
have better methods for this 'fairness' approach. 
Regarding POSIX threads being "braindamaged pile of crap", it is
unfortunately the only available standard for writing relatively
platform - independent multithreaded servers.
