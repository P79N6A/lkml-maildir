I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with a structure
per filesystem block construct. In the places where you want to
have a handle on that information.
In the data path of a lot of filesystems, it's not really useful, no
question.
But the block / buffer head concept is there and is useful for many
things obviously. fsblock, I believe, improves on it; maybe even to
the point where there won't be too much reason for many
filesystems to convert their data paths to something different (eg.
nobh mode, or an extent block mapping).

If you don't need to manipulate or manage the pagecache on a
per-block basis anyway, then you shouldn't need fsblock (or anything
else particularly special) to do higher order block sizes.
If you do sometimes need to, then fsblock *may* be a way you can
remove vmap code from your filesystem and share it with generic
code...

Agreed :)
