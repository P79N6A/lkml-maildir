Fine, I Agree, and this is why I used it in first place, I just forgot.
To wait for already running IRQ handler, that tested the dev->insuspend.
(And I assumed that interrupts are disabled on the cpu that runs .suspend, but I know now
that this isn't true.)
Besides that can I ask few more .suspend/resume questions:
1) some drivers use pci_disable_device(), and pci_enable_device().
should I use it too?
2) I accidentally did this:
	pci_set_power_state(pci_dev, pci_choose_state(pci_dev, state));
	pci_save_state(pci_dev);
I somehow thought that this is correct, that I should save the pci config state
after the power-down, but now I know that it isn't correct.
I now need to send a patch for dmfe.c network driver that has the same commands written by me.
(but it works perfectly anyway)
Is it possible to access pci configuration space in D3?
And lastly speaking of network drivers, one issue came to my mind:
most network drivars has a packet queue and in case of dmfe it is located in main memory,
and card does dma from it.
in .suspend I ignore that some packets may be in that queue, and I want
to ask, whenever there are better ways to do that.
this is my dmfe .suspend routine.
	/* Disable upper layer interface */
	netif_device_detach(dev);
	/* Disable Tx/Rx */
	db->cr6_data &= ~(CR6_RXSC | CR6_TXSC);
	update_cr6(db->cr6_data, dev->base_addr);
	/* Disable Interrupt */
	outl(0, dev->base_addr + DCR7);
	outl(inl (dev->base_addr + DCR5), dev->base_addr + DCR5);
	/* Fre RX buffers */
	dmfe_free_rxbuffer(db);
	/* Enable WOL */
	pci_read_config_dword(pci_dev, 0x40, &tmp);
	tmp &= ~(DMFE_WOL_LINKCHANGE|DMFE_WOL_MAGICPACKET);
	if (db->wol_mode & WAKE_PHY)
		tmp |= DMFE_WOL_LINKCHANGE;
	if (db->wol_mode & WAKE_MAGIC)
		tmp |= DMFE_WOL_MAGICPACKET;
	pci_write_config_dword(pci_dev, 0x40, tmp);
	pci_enable_wake(pci_dev, PCI_D3hot, 1);
	pci_enable_wake(pci_dev, PCI_D3cold, 1);
	/* Power down device*/
	pci_set_power_state(pci_dev, pci_choose_state (pci_dev,state));
	pci_save_state(pci_dev);
I guess, everybody makes mistakes... :-)
Other network drivers has a bit more complicated .suspend/.resume routines, 
but I didn't see a driver waiting for output queue to finish
