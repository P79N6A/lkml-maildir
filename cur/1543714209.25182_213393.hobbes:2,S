The sysfs directory layout is a logical representation of the underlying
data structures in the kernel.  Each directory (with exception of attribute
groups) has a 1:1 relation ship with a kobject.

Is there a dvb_adapter structure and a separate dvb_frontend
structure?  Are you prepared to ref count and dynamically allocate both
of them?

You could use attribute groups if all you want to do is provide some
logical breakout of attributes inside one kobject.  That is what I did
to put the wireless and netstat elements in different directories for the
network devices.
