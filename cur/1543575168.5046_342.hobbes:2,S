Signal 11 just means that you "seg-faulted". This is usually caused
by a coding error. However, if you have tools (like the C compiler)
that has been running fine, but starts to seg-fault, this points to
the very real possibility of a hardware error.
Modern RAM (with no error correction), running outside of its
timing specifications, is often the culpret. Even power supplies can
cause this problem. All you need is a single-bit error in a pointer's
value and -- signal 11.
Also, a bad opcode fetched from RAM with an error, also traps to
the same handler.
Do:
char main[]={0xff,0xff,0xff,0xff};
Compile and run this (it will compile!). You will see what
bad opcodes will do.
