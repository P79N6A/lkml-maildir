i am writing a 2.4.x device driver LNVRM I was going to use proc for debug
and interface
But proc dose not support report files because it dose not have OPEN and
RELASE functions
My report files work like this
    1. OPEN
        Memory is allocated and status information is loaded into the memory
    2. READ
        Normal read of the memory (report)
    5. RELASE
        The report memory is freed
so now I want my driver when is starts to make an mount point in /proc/lnvrm
and then
auto mount my FS also my FS will have whatever status info and a fixed file
in it called
device witch will be a char device node witch will point to my auto assigned
mayor / minor
number  I do not want to use 2.4.x vdev as this way just dose it all in one
I have done proc code before but run into lots of brick wills I guest I need
to know
1. how do you make a mount point in /proc ?
2. how do you auto mount that point ?
3     how do you make a device node in proc ? (I wont use this but it is
interesting to me)
also I have written a read / write FS before but this was mainly by locking
at outer peoples work
is there some relay good info on writing a linux FS for free download ? (no
I don't have any CC's)
thank you
