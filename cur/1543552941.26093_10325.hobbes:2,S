 It disables the HC's IRQ as it's stuck asserted otherwise.  With another
device sharing the IRQ you receive a never-ending storm of interrupts,
which is wrong and also hurts performance badly -- basically after an EOI
you receive another interrupt as soon as an IRQ controller can feed it. 
The USB driver is expected to reenable the IRQ and handle it.  If no USB
driver gets installed the IRQ remains disabled as expected.
