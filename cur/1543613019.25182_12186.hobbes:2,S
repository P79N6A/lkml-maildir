Subject: TCP LAST-ACK state broken in 2.4.17-pre2

Hi,
I came across the following behavior (sorry, no tcpdump but this should
be easy to reproduce with the right tools):
hostA                 hostB
  --------FIN----------->
  <-----data+FIN---------
  --------ACK-------X       (packet lost)
  <-----data+FIN---------   (retransmit)
  <-----data+FIN---------   (retransmit)
  <-----data+FIN---------   (retransmit)
          ....
  <-----data+FIN---------   (retransmit)
  --------RST----------->
HostA is running Linux 2.4.17-pre2. HostB is running Symbian OS. All the
sequence numbers pan out.
Either LAST-ACK is completely broken or Linux just cannot handle a
FIN-ACK that is piggybacked on a data segment, when received in LAST-ACK
state. It should be acked as an out-of-window segment, as usual.
Finally, the LAST-ACK state times out and Linux responds to the FIN
segment with an RST.
Cheers,
	MikaL
