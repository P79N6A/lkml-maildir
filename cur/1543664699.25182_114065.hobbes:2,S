Hello all.
How, in 2.4(.20), do i raise the number of file descriptors a process can
open? I have an app that could grown as high as 2k fds in about
hundreds of seconds (sorta of internet app) but i'm restricted to about
600 (after this, the great SYN i've received almost stops my machine for a while).
I've looked in the past messages, only found a thread from '99.
And i've changed value of __FD_SETSIZE to a really high value (16384) in
include/linux/posix_types.h and recompiled but didn't work.
In *BSDs i can change this w/ a select() system call, in linux isn't
working even if i hardcode value in.
Is this possible?
Please c/c me as i'm not subscribed to list.
Thanks in advance.
