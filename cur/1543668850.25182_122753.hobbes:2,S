Hi,
Configured for an EV56 LX164 machine, build fails in kernel/sys.c for me:
kernel/sys.c:226: conflicting types for `sys_sendmsg'
include/linux/socket.h:245: previous declaration of `sys_sendmsg'
kernel/sys.c:227: conflicting types for `sys_recvmsg'
include/linux/socket.h:246: previous declaration of `sys_recvmsg'
The sys.c declaration is "cond_syscall (sys_sendmsg)", which expands to
asmlinkage long sys_sendmsg(void) __attribute__((weak,alias("sys_ni_syscall")));
using the definition of cond_syscall in include/asm-alpha/unistd.h.
In socket.h, we have asmlinkage
"long sys_sendmsg(int fd, struct msghdr *msg, unsigned flags)"
