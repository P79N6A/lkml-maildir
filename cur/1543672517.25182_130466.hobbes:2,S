Having to have a pgdir per thread would be a bit sucky, wouldn't it?
On PPCs with the hash-table based MMU, if we wanted to do different
mappings of the same address on different CPUs, we would have to have
a separate hash table for each CPU, which would chew up a lot of
memory.  On PPC64 machines with logical partitioning, I don't think
the hypervisor would let you have a separate hash table for each CPU.
On the flip side, PPC can afford a register to point to a per-cpu data
area more easily than x86 can.

I was thinking of something like 64kB per cpu times 32 cpus = 2MB.
Anyway, 32-bit machines with > 8 cpus are a pretty rare corner case.
On 64-bit machines we have enough virtual space to give each cpu
gigabytes of per-cpu data if we want to.
