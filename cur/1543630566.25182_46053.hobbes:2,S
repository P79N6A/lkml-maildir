Hello!
I've just tried to use this sound card (embedded on motherboard) and
got the much of crackling and noise with proper sound.
Is this problem known and fixed already?
modprobe'ing of i810_audio.o and ac97_codec results here:
-- cut --
i810: Intel ICH2 found at IO 0xe000 and 0xdc00, IRQ 9
i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 6 channels.
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x8384:0x7600 (SigmaTel STAC????)
i810_audio: only 48Khz playback available.
i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 Unable to map surround DAC's (or DAC's not present), total channels = 2
-- end --
why last two lines appeared?
