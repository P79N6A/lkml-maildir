That's not right. SIGKILL forces an exit, which should close all file
descriptors and FINs should get sent for the ones which are TCP.
do_signal -> do_exit -> __exit_files -> close_files -> fput -> _fput ->
  __fput -> sock_close -> inet_release -> tcp_close -> tcp_send_fin
You can get a RST instead if you had leftover data in the receive queue, but
either way the connection should not hang around in ESTABLISHED state after
the process that owned it is gone.
