Just a note, some other distros already use the 'U' flag in taint
messages to show an "unsupported" module has been loaded.  I know it's
out-of-the-tree and will never go into mainline, just FYI if you happen
to see some 'U' flags in the wild today...
Oh, and I like this feature, makes sense to me to have this.
