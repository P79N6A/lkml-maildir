The first part of this series (1-7) contains miscellaneous patches,
some of which are needed for fuse writable mmap to work correctly.
Some of these are resends of patches already in -mm, with minor
updates.
The rest of the series adds shared writable mapping support to fuse,
with some write performance improvements thrown in.  Survives
fsx-linux, LTP and bash-shared-mappings.
There are dependencies on patches in -mm, notably
  per-backing_dev-dirty-and-writeback-page-accounting.patch
