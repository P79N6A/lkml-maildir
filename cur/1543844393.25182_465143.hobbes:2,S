Target is, after all, uCLinux embedded processor, where one should
be able to pre-determine what things go in as baseline kernel (what
hardware was used to build it) and what are possible options.
All Blackfins have internal UART (or two).
Some multiplex on same pins also CAN.
One of these weeks I should push onward my own BF537 project, I am
still just pre-collecting all tools to be able to debug it once
I commit boards to manufacturing...
