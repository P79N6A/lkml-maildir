Hi Stephen,
Firstly, thank you for your accurate description below.
Just two other questions, to expand a little.
1) How can i increase the system-wide FD limit? (with the ac patch, not using
   ulimit)
2) Do i need to still tweak /proc/sys/fs/inode-max and /proc/sys/fs/file-max,
and if so, how would i work out suitable values?
Thanks once again for your help,
Chris.
