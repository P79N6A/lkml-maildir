There are certainly cleaner ways of making this happen.

Yes, exactly.

I'm suggesting that sticking them in as an environmental variable might be
incorrect in the first place.

But it's inefficient, and occasionally these modules will touch hardware they
don't actually support. (e.g. acpi PCI hotplug driver)

Sure, but we're still tailoring the kernel interface to a specific
userspace implementation rather than requiring usage of the already available
bus-specific interfaces.  I agree it makes things easier, but as a general
convention, I don't think a specific userspace implementation should dictate
the kernel interface, especially when it doesn't fit well with some buses.

With the increased popularity of userspace drivers, I think we're eventually
going to need some driver matching infustructure in userspace anyway.  If we
move away from loading modules as a means of binding drivers to devices, and
allow userspace to match drivers to specific hardware, then we can support
really useful features like configuration caches that maintain a list of
hardware detected during the last boot-up.  This would reduce boot time and
allow for persistent configuration of driver settings for each device
instance.  Also we could support driver priorities (e.g. discriminating
between drivers that partially support a feature set and drivers that
completely support a feature set).  This is currently not possible in
kernel-space.  Finally, a fair ammount of complexity could be moved out of
the kernel.  I think these sorts of things would go a long way toward the
"just works" factor.

Yes, I think it may be a workable immediate solution.
