Which is, honestly, a bug.  The IO subsystem should not be capable of 
engaging in such deep recursion.  ext2/ext3 barely allocate anything 
on the stack (0x90 bytes at most in only a couple of calls), the vm 
is in a similar state, and even the network stack's largest allocations 
are in syscalls and timer code.  Face it, the majority of code that is 
or could cause problems are things that probably need fixing anyways.
