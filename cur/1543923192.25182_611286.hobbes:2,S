Subject: [PATCH] 0/4 fs/ioctl.c coding style, rename vfs_ioctl/do_ioctl, refactoring (take 2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series of 4 proposed patches changes fs/ioctl.c and Unionfs as
follows.  This series is against v2.6.24-rc1-192-gef49c32.
Patch 1: just applies coding standards to fs/ioctl.c (while I'm at it, I
figured it's worth cleaning VFS files one at a time).
Patch 2: does two things:
(a) Renames the old vfs_ioctl to do_ioctl, because the comment above it
    clearly indicates that it is an internal function not to be exported to
    modules; therefore it should have a more traditional do_XXX "internal
    function" name.  The new do_ioctl is exported in fs.h but not to
    modules.
(b) Renames the old (static) do_ioctl to vfs_ioctl because the names vfs_XXX
    should preferably be reserved to callable VFS functions which modules
    may call, as other vfs_XXX functions already do.  Export the new
    vfs_ioctl to (GPL) modules so others can use it (including Unionfs and
    eCryptfs).
Patch 3: factors out the switch statements' cases for
FIBMAP/FIONBIO/FIOASYNC, into three small static helper functions.
Patch 4: demonstrates how Unionfs can use the new vfs_ioctl.  I successfully
tested unionfs with this new exported vfs_ioctl.  (eCryptfs could do the
same.)
I'd like to propose that the first 3 patches be merged in -mm and even
mainline, pending review.
Erez Zadok (4):
      VFS: apply coding standards to fs/ioctl.c
      VFS: swap do_ioctl and vfs_ioctl names
      VFS: factor out three helpers for FIBMAP/FIONBIO/FIOASYNC file ioctls
      Unionfs: use vfs_ioctl
