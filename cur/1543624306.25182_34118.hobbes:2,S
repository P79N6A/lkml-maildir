I've completed the split into generic visw and voyager.  The base abstraction 
stuff is at:
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/split-2.5.6.diff
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/split-2.5.6.BK
And the voyager stuff which goes on top is at:
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/voyager-2.5.6.diff
http://www.hansenpartnership.com/voyager/files/voyager-2.5.6.BK
There are now no voyager ifdefs anywhere in the arch/i386 directories (there 
are still one or two in the asm-i386, though).
That's all I need to do for this split up if anyone else would like to pick it 
up.
