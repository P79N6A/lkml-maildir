Hi,
If anyone is planning work on/uses igafb.c, could they please drop me a
mail.  I'm looking at the possibility of sucking the support igafb.c
provides into cyber2000fb.c, and will need testers (esp. Sparc please)
I believe most of this was done a while ago by various other people
(Pete Zaitcev?)
Thanks.
