How?  No matter what we do, the outputs are going to be a deterministic
function of the state of the pool.  If the attacker can guess the entire
state of our pool (or narrow it down to 2^32 possibilities), we're screwed,
no matter what.  Right?
I must be misunderstanding your point.  What am I missing?
