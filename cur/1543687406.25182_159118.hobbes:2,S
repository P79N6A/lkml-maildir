I can't reproduce your problem here until I hit swap hard. You sure that's not 
happening? Kernel threads do get slight extra priority over regular threads 
by now which should help throughput under load. Perhaps this has tipped the 
balance on your machine when you hit swap pressure hard. Do a vmstat run 
while you can reproduce the problem.

But not in 16.3?

As Nick said, no this isn't the case.
