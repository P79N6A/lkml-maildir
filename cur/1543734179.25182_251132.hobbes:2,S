We've addressed this before. Zillions of drivers provide multiple
functions to multiple higher level subsystems. They don't all have to
be compiled together to make it work. 
2D and 3D _are_ to most intents and purposes different functions. They
are as different as IDE CD and IDE disk if not more so.

The memory manager is a later problem. Yes you need minimal memory
management in kernel but you have to put the pieces together in a sane
way *first*. Having a vga class device is easy. It fixes up your
multiple pci device registration problem, it allows DRI/fbdev
co-existance, it fixes hotplugging. It's about using the kernel tools we
already have and implementing it the way the kernel wants to think. If
you fight the kernel you get a mess, if you move with it then it ends up
where you want it. Kind of like Aikido source management.
The basics I have provide (well they crash but they will provide) the
equivalent of pci_register_* for video and DRI modules. Notifiers for
use between the two and an ability to find one from the other.
Once you have that then you can begin plugging in crap like memory
managers for those cases you need it kernel side.
