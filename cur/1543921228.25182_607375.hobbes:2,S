Would the following patch be more acceptable then? I've limited the device
id's to just the nForce 4 chipset, because that's the only one I have here
to test with at the moment - it appears to work fine:
hpet clockevent registered
hpet0: at MMIO 0xfefff000, IRQs 2, 8, 31
hpet0: 3 32-bit timers, 25000000 Hz
Time: hpet clocksource has been installed.
Switched to high resolution mode on CPU 0
Switched to high resolution mode on CPU 1
At the moment, I'm not clear on how to detect if the HPET has not been
enabled by the BIOS (but given that this is hidden behind hpet=force,
would this be acceptable, since the user would have to explicitly call
hpet=force, and then it either works or doesn't?)
