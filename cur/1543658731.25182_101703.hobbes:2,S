I completely agree. For example, I have already a bunch of cases where I
have to explicitely "hide" the host bridge from linux PCI layer as those
have BARs that mustn't be touched. A typical example is the 405gp
internal PCI host. It has a BAR that represents the view of system RAM
from bus mastering PCI devices. Of course, the kernel doesn't understand
that and tries to remap it away from 0 where it belongs ;)
