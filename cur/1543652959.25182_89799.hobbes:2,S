Too much data and the data becomes noise.
I also think that if your goal is to make things progress more smoothly,
adding work for people like dave is not a good plan.
This is not an easy problem space, on the one hand you want to have all
bugs tracked, on the other hand, trivial bugs in the bug db just make
the bug db unusable.  No engineer is going to put up with 100,000 stupid
bug reports.  You need a plan to get rid of those or keep them out of 
the bugdb or it's unlikely to get used by the people who really need to
use it.
