This doesn't come from just redhat or rpm.  You should most likely replace
your headers with a fresh copy from the glibc and g++ packages.

The GLIBC documentation instructs the installer to create these links, from
glibc-2.1.3/INSTALL:491
  Finally, configure glibc with the option
  `--with-headers=/usr/src/linux-2.2.1/include'.  Use the most recent
  kernel you can get your hands on.
     An alternate tactic is to unpack the 2.2 kernel and run `make
  config' as above.  Then rename or delete `/usr/include', create a new
  `/usr/include', and make the usual symbolic links of
  `/usr/include/linux' and `/usr/include/asm' into the 2.2 kernel
  sources.  You can then configure glibc with no special options.  This
  tactic is recommended if you are upgrading from libc5, since you need
  to get rid of the old header files anyway.
     Note that `/usr/include/net' and `/usr/include/scsi' should *not* be
  symlinks into the kernel sources.  GNU libc provides its own versions
  of these files.
