Could you download my tracing patches from here:
http://people.redhat.com/srostedt/tracing/mcount-tracing-patches-v6.tar.bz2
Apply the above patches and select all but the histogram tracers. Then 
run this program
   
http://people.redhat.com/srostedt/tracing/trace-cmd.c
  ./trace-cmd -f echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
then do this (mount debugfs):
   bzip2 -c /debugfs/tracing/latency_trace > /tmp/trace.bz2
and send the result to myself and Ingo.
