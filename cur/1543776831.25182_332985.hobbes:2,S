You would need to allocate it using vmalloc if you wanted
to put it node local, eating up precious TLB entries.
Anyways, i386 NUMA is so broken anyways regarding all that that I wouldn't
worry about node local allocation. Just allocate it somewhere, just
not statically. 
I only worried about static memory consumption of a kernel. An IDT is quite
big and NR_CPUS tends to be too.
