This is PowerPC specific stuff.  Setting aside pmac's, and boards which
use U-Boot, and other boards with a firmware that sets up the
environment directly for the vmlinux file (which is the kernel proper)
to run, the code under arch/ppc/boot/simple/ is typically run.  This
code is linked to run at 8mb and will relocate itself there, regardless
of where the firmware actually loaded it into memory.  This linked
address may be changed by enabling the ADVANCED_OPTIONS option and
choosing an alternate address.  This really only makes sense on machines
where loading at 8mb won't work as you have 8mb or less of memory.
