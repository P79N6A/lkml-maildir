Subject: PLIP patch for 2.3.15 (no-irq, parport api)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello.
I modified the PLIP patch to apply on kernel 2.3.15. Due to the size of the
patch, I decided against posting it to the mailing list.
You can find it (as well as the 2.2.10 version - which should apply on
2.2.12), at:
   
http://thor.prohosting.com/~zimerman
The highlights:
   * Make the PLIP driver support parallel ports with no IRQ.
   * Separate the PLIP driver from the hardware, making it use the parallel
     port API.
Please let me know if you find anything wrong.
                                                   Nimrod
