Sounds like the academic masturbation of trying to find an optimal 
solution to a non-existing problem instead of fixing real issues.
The fact that most testers have a PC plus Toralfs randconfigs has
already catched virtually all compile issues visible on a PC in the 
past during -rc.
If you want to attack real problems then write a script that sends the 
names of all people who signed-off patches touching include/linux/ or 
include/asm-generic/ without having tested the compilation of at least 
the defconfig on all architectures to George W. Bush together with the 
information that these people possess at least as many weapons of mass 
destruction as Saddam Hussein in 2003...
