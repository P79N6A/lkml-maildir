   Err, Dave, that's *exactly* the point of the ccCluster stuff.  You get
   all that seperation for every data structure for free.  Think about
   it a bit.  Aren't you going to feel a little bit stupid if you do all
   this work, one object at a time, and someone can come along and do the
   whole OS in one swoop?  Yeah, I'm spouting crap, it isn't that easy,
   but it is much easier than the route you are taking.  
How does ccClusters avoid the file system namespace locking issues?
How do all the OS nodes see a consistent FS tree?
All the talk is about the "magic filesystem, thread it as much as you
want" and I'm telling you that is the fundamental problem, the
filesystem name space locking.
