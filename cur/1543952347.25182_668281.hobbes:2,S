Yes, IMO you are right. 4c7ffe0 ("fbdev: prevent drivers that have hardware 
cursors from calling software cursor code") introduced the senseless code.
I'm going on testing today, but I think that's it.
Again, please CC me, thanks.

Since 4c7ffe0b9f7f40bd818fe3af51342f64c483908e ("fbdev: prevent drivers that 
have hardware cursors from calling software cursor code") every call of 
i810fb_cursor fails with -ENXIO because of a incorrect "!".
This hasn't striked until eaa0ff15c30dc9799eb4d12660edb73aeb6d32c5 ("fix ! 
versus & precedence in various places") surrounded the expression with 
braces, so that the intended behavior was inverted. That caused 'pixel 
waste' - the same line of multi-colored pixels repeated over the whole 
screen - during console switch.
This switches back to the original pre-4c7ffe0 behavior.
