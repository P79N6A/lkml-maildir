	Yes, I know, I've been doing that for IrDA. What I meant was
that this specific module parameter could be remove entirely because
redundant.

	I think it would be nice to give some more explicit feedback
to Jouni.

	You misunderstood. The HostAP driver has a pretty much
complete generic 802.11 stack. However, other driver can't depend on
that code until it's in the kernel.
	By "big 802.11 reorg", I meant "make the other driver depend
on HostAP 802.11 code".
	Of course, I'm quite partial to the HostAP code because I'm
more familiar with it and I believe it's the most advanced (host WEP,
802.1x, WPA, AP...). Other candidated are linux-wlan-ng or the *BSD
stack (by the way of the MadWifi driver).

	Thanks ;-) I would need to make sure that there is no popular
driver still using the old driver API (orinoco_cs is converted in the
CVS).
