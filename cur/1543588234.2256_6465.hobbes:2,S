You surely can do 
#undef ENABLE_SX_SPECIALSTUFF
however, then the "upgrade path" to a configurable parameter in the
configuration stuff is harder.
Now, as far as I know, this is rarely (if ever) used right now. (but
I've been tempted to do it in the past) Maybe with better
configuration tools, always declaring it a configuration option is a
good idea.
Think about it. Consider the issue, decide whatever you want. Tell me
about it. (i.e. what you suggest is the best way to deal with this.) (*)

(*) you may say: "But I just did that". However the above hints at
that you skipped over the "but I'd like to prepare for the case where
the configuration of that parameter should be made easier by including
it in the config mechanism."
