Hi Greg, all,
> This patch doesn't apply on top of my stack, first because the
> hardware monitoring drivers have been moved to drivers/hwmon, second
> because the via686a driver had indentation cleanups since 2.6.12.
> 
> Could you please provide this patch against 2.6.13-mm1?
On Denis' request, I have done that myself.

We can save 0.5kB of data in the via686a driver.
