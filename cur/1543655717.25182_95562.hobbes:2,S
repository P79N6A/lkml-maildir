I suspect that is most often the case. My task, working for an OEM,
is to provide access to the available hardware. The customer's decide
if the hardware is appropriate to their needs, and still many customers
are demanding access to these devices. I am going to try to do a study
on whether additional hardware timers are of any benefit given the
resources available on current standard hardware and the availability of
the high-res patch, but the additional hardware is probably still going
to be available because it is needed on others OS's.

Hmmm, that sounds promising.

Very good.

I've already sent Santa my list.
Thanks for the advice.
