Hi there.
A plea for help it seems to me kernel related.
I endly want to burn an audio cd and the new version of cdrecord should make
that possible also for Linux users.
I use gcc 3.2 and glibc 2,3 on an AMD K6-3 machine.
But compiling fails with this 1-11a38 version and I realy don't know where to
get any help.
The previous version compiled ok.
This is the error what causes the problems:
	==> COMPILING "OBJ/i586-linux-cc/scsihack.o"
In file included from scsi-linux-sg.c:69,
                 from scsihack.c:127:
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h:172: parse error before "u8"
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h:172: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h:173: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
make[2]: *** [OBJ/i586-linux-cc/scsihack.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/cdrtools-1.11/libscg'
make[1]: *** [all] Error 2
Any help would be very kind, thank you
