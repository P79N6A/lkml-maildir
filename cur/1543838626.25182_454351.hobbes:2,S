Which .config settings are necessary? I tried to use it (uniprocessor, 
no debug options enabled), but the compilation failed. 2.6.18-rc4 
kernel. All 7 patches applied.
And: Are you sure that the slabifier works on vmalloc ranges? The code 
uses virt_to_page(). Does that function work for vmalloc on all archs?
The lack of virt_to_page() on vmalloc/mempool memory. always prevented 
the slab allocator from handling such memory.
