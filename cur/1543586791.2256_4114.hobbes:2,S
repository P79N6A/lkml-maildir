Hi,
although the comments in errno.h say that ERESTARTSYS should not be seen
by userland,many drivers seam to return it from their
file_operations.Should glibc convert this errno so that the user program
sees something meaningful?Because it does not.Is EINTR not a better errno 
to return from the drivers?
Thanks.
