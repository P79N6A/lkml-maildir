There is at least one reason I think your code cannot work: When
resuming, you are basically blowing up the MMU hash table and kernel
page tables when copying the pages. I'm hacking on an implementation
of pmdisk at the moment that switches the MMU off during the page
copy to avoid that problem. This isn't the best way though.
I'll keep you informed of my progress
Ben.
