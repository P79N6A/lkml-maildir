I've also set up systems where there is a carefully rate-limited  
SCHED_RR 98 ssh process (NIC interrupt thread is SCHED_RR 99) behind  
an additional set of rate-limiting rules in IPtables.  Basically, no  
matter what somebody is doing to the workstation, even if I let them  
create as many processes as they want or get the box completely into  
a swap storm, I can "ssh -p 222 root@some.box".  Once it connects I  
type in two passwords through a custom PAM plugin and then have my  
login script touch /etc/nologin and send SIGSTOP to every
The resource consumption issue is immediately over and I can go about  
kicking the user and filling out all the icky paperwork.
