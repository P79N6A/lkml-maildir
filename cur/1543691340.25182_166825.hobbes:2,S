Looks like someone needs to fix up include/asm-sparc64/termbits.h:
/* These have totally bogus values and nobody uses them
   so far. Later on we'd have to use say 0x10000x and
   adjust CBAUD constant and drivers accordingly.
#define B2500000  0x00001010
#define B3000000  0x00001011
#define B3500000  0x00001012
#define B4000000  0x00001013  */
thanks,
