Not quite.
sys_kill knows about three kinds of things referred to by pid.
- individual processes (positive pid)
- process groups (pid < -1 or pid == 0)
- The group of all processes.
When you have multiple instances of the same pid on the box
The group of all processes becomes the group of all processes I
can see.  At least that was my impression.

Ok. I'm not quite certain what the difference is.  In OpenVZ it appears
to be something significant.  In most conversations it is not.

Well the number of places you need to translate may be small.
But the number of lines of code is certainly large.
Every driver, every ioctl, every other function that could
be abused ioctl.
And if the values are ever stored instead of used immediately
you can get a context mismatch.
