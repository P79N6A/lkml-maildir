I would hope that the kernel does check the return, since it still can
fail for other reasons an return a NULL, and it is more likely to fail
for other reasons, since this will already BUG on the duplicate case.
But your suggestion is probably a good one, and I'm sure there are
probably other calls that should have that same check.
