Using ssty or fbset only changes the resolution on the local VC. I did 
this because often with fbset the user sets the mode to something the 
monitor has a hard time with. If this happened to all the VCs then you 
have to type blind to fix all the VCs. So IMO it is better to risk losing 
one VC then all of them. You can change the size of all VCs by calling the 
vt ioctl call VT_RESIZE

Not in this set of patches but with client support coming soon we will be 
able to change the VCs resolution via fbset again.
