Proxy ARP of subnets is also very handy when it comes to a remote VPN
though an tunnel device. If there is a remote subnet, proxy arp makes it
appear nicely on the local net. If subnet Proxy arp has been removed, it
makes it more difficult for some VPN applications I have installed with
2.0.x to upgrade to 2.2 ... would have to proxy each IP address
individually.
