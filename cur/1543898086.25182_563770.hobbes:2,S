The Coverity checker spotted the following use-after-free of "skb" in 
drivers/net/wireless/libertas/rx.c introduced by
commit 9012b28a407511fb355f6d2176a12d4653489672 (WTF did this commit
with the title "libertas: make debug configurable" add the 
"skb->protocol = __constant_htons(0x0019);" line?):
<--  snip  -->
...
static int process_rxed_802_11_packet(wlan_private * priv, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
...
        libertas_upload_rx_packet(priv, skb);
        ret = 0;
done:
        skb->protocol = __constant_htons(0x0019);       /* ETH_P_80211_RAW */
...
<--  snip  -->
