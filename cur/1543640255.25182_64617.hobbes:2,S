The gdt descriptor alignment really shouldn't matter, but that bogus GDT 
_size_ thing in the descriptor might do it. 
Right now it's set to be 0x8000, which is not a legal GDT size (it should 
be of the form n*8-1), and is nonsensical anyway (the comment says 2048 
entries, but the fact is, we don't _have_ 2048 entries in there).
