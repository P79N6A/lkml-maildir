Why does this has to be done manually?
Reporting a bug in a Bugzilla only requires creating an account (if you 
don't have one) and entering the bug. It's not a "do it again", since 
the user already has the whole contents of the bug report. If you've 
written an email with a good bug report pasting it into a Bugzilla 
shouldn't be a problem.
The big problem for users of many bug tracking systems (including the 
kernel Bugzilla) is not that bug reporting was too hard. The problem is 
that bugs aren't handled in time.
