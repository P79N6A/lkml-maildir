We just "fixed" this sort of problem for ppc64 the other day. Course we
don't use bzImages but rather zImages but none the less it was still
anoying since we can boot zImages over the network and
of course that makes it quite reasonable to blow past the 1.44
floppy limitation. The bug we fixed was that an uncompressed
kernel could only be up to 4 meg in size, if it was larger, at
uncompression time you'd just lose everything past the 4M mark.
Todd Inglett raised the limit to 8 meg for us, and that's a mighty
large penguin....
Regards,
Tom
