Platform management, early console access, acpi, hotplug io-node w/ root,...
pci_bus based access is useless before pci driver is initialized.
All exceptions will be forced to use fake structs...
Sounds we need to be ready to live with all exceptions here too :)
Or just to make them all happy with that simple bare functions.

OK, if simple and pure pci config access is not possible in Linux land,
let pci driver fake itself, not everyone else :)
Just export the two APIs like pci_config_{read|write}(s,b,d,f,s,v),
or the ones in acpi driver. Hide the fake pci_bus manipulation in them. 
This way is way better than having everyone fake pci driver ;-)
Thanks,
J.I.
