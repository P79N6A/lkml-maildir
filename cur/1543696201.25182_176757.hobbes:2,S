I have an i686 with RH9 and i installed Red Hat unofficial rpm's 
(kernel-2.6.0-0.test9.1.70.i686.rpm , etc..)
Everything is working fine expect for this boot messages (I'll try to 
remember):
USB not working - missing 
	usb_uhci
	mousedev
	keybdev
Also i can't mount my fat32 partitions. (I have no problem with RH9 kernel, 
fstab is ok)
Finally,  mouse movement is way too accelerated.
