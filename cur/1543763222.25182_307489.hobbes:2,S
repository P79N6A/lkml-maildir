Yes.  That's why I was particularly glad to see the patches from Karsten;
they were the first ones that actually got "it works for me now!!" reports.
With luck, all full speed ISO-OUT transfers will now work through EHCI.
Even through the funky multi-TT hubs from Cypress.  My main question is
whether this is also true of the TDI (nee ARC) EHCI silicon that's being
embedded in various non-PCI chips.
This all seems off-topic for latency though.  :)
