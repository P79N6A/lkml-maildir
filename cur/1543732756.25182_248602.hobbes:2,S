Ok, and right now I'm in vim typing this message and want
to ":new /tmp/backup.iso/etc/fstab"
modifying 1000+ applications is not an option IMO. Putting it in
a preloaded library might be doable except maybe for permission
problems but this is incredibly clumsy and lacks the possibility
to implement sane caching behavior because it is process bound.
