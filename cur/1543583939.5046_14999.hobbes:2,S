Can you provide me with a dmesg from a boot with aic7xxx=verbose?
I just tested this on a 3940AUW and the behavior was as expected.
Perhaps you have a motherboard based controller that has no seeprom?
I don't know how to detect flipped channels in that configuration
but I'll see what I can find out.
