I got around to trying it on a NUMA-Q again.  It makes it well into 
the kernel this time.  I've been getting some strange CPU numbering 
problems, but that was happening to a lesser extent before I threw 
kexec in there.
Right now it's dying in the memory allocator, but that is probably 
just something that didn't get initialized right, or some cross-quad 
memory that isn't set up right.
I would really like to see this go into 2.5.  The fact that it gets 
this far on something as exotic as a NUMA-Q is a tribute to its 
maturity.
