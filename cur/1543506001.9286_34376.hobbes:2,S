Subject: [PATCH] USB mouse suspend/resume fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The USB mouse driver oopses when my laptop suspend/resumes as well as when
I disconnect the mouse. The problem is due to a null pointer dereference
in mouse_irq when state == USB_ST_REMOVED. The following patch allows
the mouse to function following a resume or reconnect. It also fixes
an issue with module use count not incrementing if driver already in
use.
Although this works, I'm not sure its the right thing to do. Should
the driver really suspend the use of the mouse when it is disconnected,
or should it close it and require /dev/usbmouse to be reopened? If
so, that will mean the X server and gpm would need to be recoded to
expect that to happen. Alternatively a virtual mouse driver could
interface to a userspace program that multiplexes access to the
real mouse drivers and handles them disappearing...
Lastly, if I insert the mouse driver automatically with the following
modifications to conf.modules, then the first open of /dev/usbmouse
will fail due to mouse_probe() being called after open_mouse() has
returned EINVAL due to mouse->present being false. Can someone
point me to a better method of inserting the mouse driver automatically,
or can the driver be fixed to handle this?
