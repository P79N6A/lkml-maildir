There are several parts of XFS which do not compile correctly with gcc 2.95.2,
but do with egcs 1.1
For example consider the appended test case. It breaks with 2.95-stable
(from CVS March or so) because the bh->b_blocknr >>= block_bits;
shift is miscompiled. The problem seems to be that it forgets to reload
the %cl register used for the variable shift after the long long shift 
before, leading to a bogus shift.
Another problem is that linus' do_div in asm-i386/div64.h seems to cause
miscompiled code when used in anything more complicated than printk (no 
extracted test case yet sorry) 
Assembly from gcc 2.95 for the 
            bh->b_blocknr = (long)mp->pbm_bn +
                        (mp->pbm_offset >> inode->i_sb->s_blocksize_bits);
                bh->b_blocknr >>= block_bits;
                bh->b_state |= (1UL << 4 );
