I think I have a compromise that'll make everyone happy here. I've
added a tunable called trust_pct in /proc/sys/kernel/random. Set it to
100% and untrusted sources will always add a bit of entropy. Defaults
to zero, which should be fine for everyone who's got a head.
Then we can add SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM for network devices unconditionally.
Untested, applies on top of my previous patches:
