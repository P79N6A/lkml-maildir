You may have any issues here, esp. with initscripts. You may try
current cooker.

EBUSY but no idea why it is reported; probably by driver?

check that /dev/snd is not a file or link or whatever. Remove it,
remove /lib/dev-state/snd and try again. If it persists (i.e. you
have non-directory /dev/snd appearing every time on boot) try
to find out why it is created. ALSA initscript in Mandrake creates
/dev/snd as link to /proc/whatever if it believes devfs is not present. It may be one possible reason.
