Damn, I know this is off-topic, but I'm looking at this transcript and
it stinks.
Every time a questioner uses the word 'kernel', Chris_MSNBC spells
it correctly.  Every time Linus uses the word 'kernel', Chris_MSNBC
misspells it as 'kernal'.
IMHO, the transcript makes Linux look like a happy-go-lucky,
I-slapped-it-together-in-my-spare-time project.
