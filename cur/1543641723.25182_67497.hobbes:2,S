Hi Alan,
somewhere between 2.4.18 and 2.4.19 i810_audio.c was changed to exclude
softmodems from initilization. Since then, i cannot use the mixer anymore
and also 44.1khz rates don't work anymore. Reverting the change made these
things work again.
I don't know if it's right what i did, could you please have a look at the
attached patch ?
For completeness, here is the output of dmesg and lspci -vv:
non-working:
i810: Intel 440MX found at IO 0x8400 and 0x8200, IRQ 5
i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 2 channels.

i810_audio: codec 0 is a softmodem - skipping.
