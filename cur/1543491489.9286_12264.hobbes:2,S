Greetings,
I'll be the first to admit that I might be doing something wrong, but I
can't seem to get ipchains -y to work as advertised.
I'm currently running 2.2.3-ac4.  If I add a rule like:
ipchains -A input -j DENY -p TCP -s 0.0.0.0/0 -y -d 207.49.94.113/32
the rule denies _all_ TCP packets to that IP address.  Same with \! -y, and
with both -y and \! -y with ACCEPT instead of DENY.
Am I doing something wrong?  Or is there a bug here?
