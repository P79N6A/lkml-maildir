This never had to do with the clocksource. The tracer itself isn't atomic
against NMIs. hmm, it may actually be. It does a tracer disable for the
CPU by an atomic_inc and this would prevent the NMI from causing harm.
I'll test without this patch and see what happens when I turn on a high
rate of NMIS.
I still want to add a bit more notraces around for the simple
reason of cleaning up the output and prehaps speeding up the code a bit.
