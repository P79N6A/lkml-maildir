Hello-
My system hangs on startup at the following prompt:
checking file systems
/dev/sda: recovering journal
I have tried letting it just sit there and "recover" for 2 hours at
first and then for 24 hours with still no luck. Does anyone have any
ideas? And/or does anyone know the severity of this problem?
