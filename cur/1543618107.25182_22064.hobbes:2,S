Since the preemption patch only allows additional preemption in kernel
mode, I'm curious to know what the compute bound tasks are doing in 
kernel mode. Did Linux add in-kernel matrix multiplication while
I was not looking?

"Statistically"?  As far as I know, most I/O in Linux does not block.
When you say "statistically", you should have some analysis with clearly
stated assumptions.

Sorry. No sale.
