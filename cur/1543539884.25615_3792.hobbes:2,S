I didn't say you would. My point was that changing firmware live on a
production system where any downtime is critical would not be very safe.

In the case of hard drives, they should be hot-swappable in this
environment - in which case, you can remove them, upgrade them off-line on
a spare workstation, then restore them once you know they work.
What would you have done in your production system if the firmware upgrade
had, say, upset the SCSI ID selection so it conflicted with another drive
in the RAID array? You just lost two drives at once. Or, worse still, if
it starts flooding the bus with crap, because the firmware upgrade went
wrong, or the image had a bug in??
