Ingo was talking to Andi, the x86_64 maintainer, not to Andrew.
And I share his opinion that the maintainer of the subsystem, which is
affected by such a fundamental patch, could have at least shown any
public sign of interest, disgust, comment or what ever in a 3+ month
time frame.
Especially about a patch, which is a logical consequence of an almost
two years public and transparent effort to consolidate the time code in
the kernel.
I for my part have no problem maintaining the set for another round out
of tree and weed out eventually problems in -mm, but my expectation for
qualified response of the responsible maintainer is exactly zero right
now.
Thanks,
