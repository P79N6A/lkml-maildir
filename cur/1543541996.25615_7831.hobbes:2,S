I don't have a high bandwidth connection either.  I still _very much_
prefer a large patch to an URL.  Once it's loaded, (I'm patient) it
can sit and wait to be read/re-read.  I'm a busy little penguin.. if
I have to go get it, I probably won't (unless it's really important)
simply because I have so many things I want to do that hours run out.
wrt money: I live in Germany!!.. and I still prefer to load the patch.
Heck, most of the time, there's more generic noise than patches by far.
:) send lotsa [mondo] patches. I _love_ patches.. especially the kind
it hurts to read.
