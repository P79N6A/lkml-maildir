I'm not a knowledgeable person, but I've been following Mosix/beowulf/? for
a few years and trying to keep up.
I've thought that it would be good to break up the different clustering
frills -- node identification, process migration, process hosting, distributed
memory, yadda yadda blah, into separate bite-sized portions.  
Centralization would be good for standardizing on what /proc/?/?/? you read to
find out what clusters you are in, and whatis your node number there.  There
is a lot of theorhetical work to be done.
Until then, I don't expect to see the Complete Mosix Patch Set available
from ftp.kernel.org in its current form, as a monolithic set that does many things,
including its Very Own Distributed File System Architecture.
If any of the work from Mosix will make it Into The Standard Kernel it will be
by backporting and standardization.
Is there a good list to discuss this on?  Is this the list?  Which pieces of
clustering-scheme patches would be good to have? 
I think a good place to start would be node numbering.
The standard node numbering would need to be flexible enough to have one machine
participating in multiple clusters at the same time.
/proc/cluster/....	this would be standard root point for clustering stuff
/proc/mosix would go away, become proc/cluster/mosix
and the same with whatever bproc puts into /proc; that stuff would move to
/proc/cluster/bproc
Or, the status quo will endure, with cluster hackers playing catch-up.
