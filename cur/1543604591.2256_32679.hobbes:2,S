I posted this a while back in linux-smp (which seems like a dead list?)
I have several P4 Xeon SMP systems (Supermicro P4DCE, Intel i860
chipset)

	How much of a problem is this really?  The program's I am
running on these systems (I have 9 of them) seem do ok right now.
Currently the jobs running on them are heavily CPU bound and don't do
any I/O, but this is going to change when I link them up over a private
network so they can work together on some distributable jobs).  I am
running 2.4.10 on most of them, and 2.4.10-ac10 on my developer system
in the farm.  The only difference this newer kernel seems to have made
from older ones is that there is only one 'warning unexpected IO-APIC'
message in my startup instead of two.
Snippet from dmesg:
