Ok.  SUBTERFUGUE, which I just posted an announcment for, demonstrates process
following over vfork and clone.  The patch it uses is pretty similar to what
was being discussed here in December, but adds a couple of things.  Here is a
description of the patch (from 
http://subterfugue.org/patches.html
).  The
patch itself, against 2.3.42, is appended below.
(Sorry, I don't have a working strace, but I believe the same techniques used
in SUBTERFUGUE will also work for strace.  I'll happily render any needed
assistance to make that happen.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the changes included in the patch.  Most are fairly innocuous
extensions, but the first two might break some things.
  1. The exit_code reported during PTRACE_SYSCALL stops now has its high bit
     (0x80) set, to distinguish it from signal stops.  Unfortunately, this
     breaks strace, and probably any other program that uses PTRACE_SYSCALL
     (see ptrace(2)).  The fix is pretty simple--just mask off the high bit
     (or adapt the program to make use of the extra information).  A patch is
     available that does this for strace.  (It doesn't appear that gdb is
     affected.)
  2. When a new child is created with clone and CLONE_PARENT is set, and the
     child is being traced (e.g., it's done a PTRACE_TRACEME), it will now
     report to the first process' parent.  This is correct behavior, but it
     opens up what some would consider a security hole--a malicious child
     might unexpectedly invoke PTRACE_TRACEME, causing it to report to a
     waiting parent process that never expected to hear from it.  This was
     discussed on linux-kernel for a bit; there didn't seem to be a
     consensus about whether this was even a hole at all.
  3. A new wait flag __WALL is implemented, to allow clone and non-clone
     children to be waited for simultaneously.
  4. A new ptrace command PTRACE_GETPPID is implemented, which lets a
     tracing process discover the original parent of a traced child.  This
     information is otherwise unavailable.
  5. Exits of the system calls fork, vfork, and clone are now reported.
