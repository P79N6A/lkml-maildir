Subject: Problem initializing PCI boards where IRQ has to be guessed

I had this problem in 2.4.27...the same code is in 2.6.8.1
If the bios doesn't assign an interrupt, the guessing algorithm is 
able to work only in a very special case (when the mask is one bit).
In 2.4.27 (I have lxr.linux.no for 2.4.26, its the same in
2.6.8.1)
933         if (!irq) {
934                 DBG(" ... failed\n");
935                 if (newirq && mask == (1 << newirq)) {
936                         msg = "Guessed";
937                         irq = newirq;
938                 } else
939                         return 0;
In 2.4.27 I have:
