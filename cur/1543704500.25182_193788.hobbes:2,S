There are two things to do. First you should mount the disk with the
noatime option.
The other thing is ext3 which is updating its journal every 5
seconds. I was told that laptop-mode was imported into 2.6 by now (I
think that it is in the main stream). Check the kernel docs there
should be some mount option to state the dirty time for the ext3
journal. The method changed since 2.4 so I don't remember the 2.6
option since I don't use it yet, sorry.
