Theres still boatloads of bits in my tree (around 4MB worth),
last night I spent some time banging on it trying to get things
into a usable, testable state again. The fact it doesn't boot
on my testboxes right now is somewhat limiting, as is being
buried alive in non-2.5 work.

Probably numerous reasons (as me). My laptop hangs on boot (no idea why),
my VIA C3 box dies with preemption, some other boxes are still unusable
due to broken SCSI drivers afair.

There's mountains of silly one liner fixes for various problems
(from compile fixes to stability to security issues) in my tree
that need pushing to Linus, the hard part right now is finding
time to do so, but lots of it can even wait until after the feature freeze.
What's important right now is getting everything in that we *need*
included, (biggest absense imo is probably a replacement LVM right now)

*nods*, and with the addition of the various debugging aids that have
popped up in the last week or so, I've no doubt we're on track to nail
down a lot more hard-to-find bugs than we ever have been before long
before hitting a x.x.0 release
