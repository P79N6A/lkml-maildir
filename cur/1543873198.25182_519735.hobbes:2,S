OK, thanks!  I'm still quite a git-nubie.
I'll update all the move patches. It may take a bit of hand work.
What I really did to do this patch series was to make all my changes in
git.  But the changes where not smooth from change set to change set. So
I did one big git-diff, and then used good old midnight commander (mc)
to parse the patches. And then pulled them into quilt to comment and
send them.

I wish I knew this before breaking it up.   But I'm sure I can do
another big patch and automate these updates :)
