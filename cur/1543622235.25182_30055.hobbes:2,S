My scripts are on master.kernel.org:/home/torvalds/BK/tools, although I
haven't bothered to clean some of them up that really should be cleaned
up (things like email parsing that breaks on some emails due to MIME
and/or "^From " in the body etc). 
Those tools include all the scripts to make changelogs, apply patches
from emails etc.
And they require the recent bitkeeper that can take comments and user
information for "bk import -tpatch". 
(Yeah, "master" isn't an open machine, but Marcelo, Rik, Jeff etc can
all get in on it, if somebody wants to push the tools out somewhere else
they can certainly do so).
