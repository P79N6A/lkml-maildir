It is no such thing.
  Restriction \Re*stric"tion\, n. [F. restriction, L. restrictio.]
     1. The act of restricting, or state of being restricted;
        confinement within limits or bounds.
You can fully exercise your rights under the GPL; they are not
restricted.  However, you cannot expect future support from Sveasoft.
Only your contract entitles you to that support, and if you do
something to terminate your contract, it is outside the GPL's scope.
This is unpleasant for a lot of people.  It is probably suboptimal for
the free software community.  Life can be hard like that.  Any
competent lawyer could have a copyright infringement claim dismissed
if the claim were based on your theory of the GPL.
