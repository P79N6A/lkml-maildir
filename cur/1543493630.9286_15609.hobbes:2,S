I haven't seen anyone else complaining about it, but here goes anyway.
I am mounting some Samba shares on my Linux box from various servers, one smbfs
mount from a Win95 box, another from another Linux-2.2.6/Samba-2.0.3 box.
The read/write performance to the mounted filesystems is _very_ slow.
Write performance is about 40KB/s (thats KBytes), and read performance is about
1-200KB/s.
When not communicating over a mounted smbfs, such as NFS, SMB, FTP, etc, I get
normal transfer speeds.  These machines are on a quiet LAN.
Another oddity:  smbclient performs at normal speeds to the other Linux/Samba
box, but smbclient to the Win95 box results is horrid write performance
(~10-15KB/s) but much better read performance (600KB/s).  Yet both mounted fs's
perform close to the same!
Samba is version 2.0.3 on both Linux machines, as well as smbmount.
Any ideas?
