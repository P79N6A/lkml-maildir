Sure we can. In that case we can pre-create only alowed devices for a container
and be happy, but this is not a flexible way of doing things. The main problem is
that udev will stop working in such a container. Patching one is not an option
either, for the reasons I have described before.
Many virtualization functionality we're submitting can be achieved via proper
userpace modifications, but we want to be able to run old software (from old
and even historic distributions) inside containers, so we have to make this
at the kernel level.
Thanks,
