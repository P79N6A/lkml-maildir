I'm quite currious. The time you give of user vs. system is sampled
on the system clock (this is how it's done one linux). The problem
is that this data is highly inaccurate. Events in the kernel happen
every couple of microseconds. Sampling on the system clock, which
happens every 10 ms on an intel system, leaves 10000 microseconds
unaccounted for! Have you tried the Linux Trace Toolkit? This tool
will provide you with the exact times, down to the microsecond of
usage for any process and exactly how much time this process lost
waiting for I/O. This is information that is currently unavailable
by any other means.
