No, the problem only seems to exist when the low level SCSI drivers are 
being used as modules, not linked into the kernel.
Just tried it with 2.4.10-pre10: sym53c8xx and aic7xxx loaded as module
==> "cat /proc/partitions" gives infinite output (and my /dev/hda does
not show up at all). Both drivers compiled into the kernel ==> everything 
is fine; even my /dev/hda shows up.
