    If you add a comment convention to /proc/mounts so you can use it
as a substitute for /etc/mtab, you will probably break the apps that
use /etc/mtab. I was wondering, then... does the kernel *read*
/proc/mounts contents? If the answer is no, then you can add all
syntactic noise you want to /proc/mounts, exporting options needed
for userspace programs, with no problem. You can make /proc/mounts to
look like /etc/mtab. That will solve most of the problems.
    If the kernel needs to read /proc/mounts, then you have a
problem: you will need /etc/mtab as long as you have to use loop
devices, user mounts, etc.
