Hi!
Just a few suggestions...
1. The old protocol must stay with 255 + null command 
line... I suggest:
For boot protocol <2.02, the kernel command line is a 
null-terminated string up to 255 characters long, plus the 
final null. For boot protocol >=2.02 command line that is 
referred by cmd_line_ptr is null-terminated string, the 
kernel will truncate this string if it is too large to handle.
2. I suggest adding a new configuration to set the size of 
command-line, so it won't be hard coded...
Add CONFIG_CMD_LINE_SIZE with default of 1024.
I've done this by init/Kconfig...

3. Set the COMMAND_LINE_SIZE to CONFIG_CMD_LINE_SIZE
I've found that not all files that includes setup.h and 
param.h include config.h... So I've written:
#if defined(CONFIG_CMD_LINE_SIZE)
#define COMMAND_LINE_SIZE CONFIG_CMD_LINE_SIZE
#endif
So that it fails if you try to use COMMAND_LINE_SIZE and did 
not include config.h, another alternative is to include 
config.h in these include files... I don't know what the 
conventions are.

Alon Bar-Lev.
