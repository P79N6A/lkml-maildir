On second thoughts, I think it's a bad idea to change the macro - in 2.6
at least. There are lots of uses of kunmap_atomic, and most of them do
the right thing. It's only inattentive people like me that need to fix
their code. :>
It would be good, though, to have kunmap_atomic warn on invalid
parameters (want a patch for that?)
