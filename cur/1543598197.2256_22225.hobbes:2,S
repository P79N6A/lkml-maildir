Honestly, I don't have a clue what you are talking about.  I think you
have a misconception about how the entropy gathering works, the
differences between /dev/random and /dev/urandom, and what entropy even
is.
I don't know what your problem is with with allowing net devices to feed
the pool.
Finally, /dev/random and /dev/urandom have the same "strength" -- the
_only_ difference is that /dev/random will block if the _entropy_ count
is 0. note, again, this is not the byte count.  by design, the size of
the pool does not decrement as you read from it. just the estimate of
the entropy.
