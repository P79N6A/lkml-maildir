my host is a vpn gateway, and i have several virtual interface to run
vpn. ie tap0, tap1....
I have to add routes to these TAPs to make vpn work. but after i restart
the tapX, i have
to re-add routes relate to this interface~
If i have to maintain several vpn and lots of TAPs , So i need a simple
way to maintian route tables.
sometimes it's quite diffcult to do this with shell scipts ,especially
when it's quite complex.
thanks~
