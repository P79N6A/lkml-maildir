Mathiue, FWIW I like this idea. A few years ago I implemented something
similar, but that had no explicit clients. Consequently I made my hooks
code more generalized than is needed in practice. I do remember that Karim
reworked the LTT instrumentation to use hooks and it worked fine.
You've got the same optimizations for x86 by modifying an instruction's
immediate operand and thus avoiding a d-cache hit. The only real caveat is
the need to avoid the unsynchronised cross modification erratum. Which
means that all processors will need to issue a serializing operation before
executing a Marker whose state is changed. How is that handled?
One additional thing we did, which might be useful at some future point,
was adding a /proc interface. We reflected the current instrumentation
though /proc and gave the status of each hook. We even talked about being
able to enable or disabled instrumentation by writing to /proc but I don't
think we ever implemented this.
It's high time we settled the issue of instrumentation. It gets my vote,
Good luck!
