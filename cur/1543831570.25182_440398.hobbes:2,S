Yes, that would be the right way to go. But it is a longer term
solution and AFAIK noone is currently working on it.
In the mean time, several users can benefit from an intermediate
solution like the one I suggested. Besides, it is not a wrong solution
per se, it is equally wrong as the ac_read/write routines that are
exported.
So I still think that exporting the current acpi_ec_read/write would
be a good thing to so, but I agree it should be marked as an
intermediate solution.
