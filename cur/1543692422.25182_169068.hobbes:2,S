No. It (kernel changing according to 'm' options) happens at the moment,
and it's evil and broken. Adrian proposes that it should not happen at
all.
The suggestion is that if your kernel was built with
'CONFIG_ALLOW_IPV6_SUPPORT=y' then it has all the structures etc. of the
right size, and the tristate option 'CONFIG_IPV6' becomes available. If
you build with 'CONFIG_ALLOW_IPV6_SUPPORT=n' then you cannot build IPv6.

So build with CONFIG_MODULES=n.

No. It's very clear. 
But the current situation is confusing, where you set 'CONFIG_IPV6=m'
and 'make modules' to build IPv6 support since it appears to be modular,
and then the module either doesn't load or loads and oopses due to
structures changing in size.
