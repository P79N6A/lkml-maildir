I don't think that's true.  We rely on taking function pointers of 
static inlines pretty extensively; native_read_tsc is hardly unique in 
this respect.  I don't remember seeing any problems of the sort you 
describe.  (I can well believe this may have been a problem at some 
point, but not during the pv-ops development timeframe.)

I'm trying to remember the real reason for 
__native_read_tsc/native_read_tsc.  At least part of it is that 
__native_read_tsc is used in a vdso, and so *must* be inlined to avoid a 
bogus call from user to kernel space.  But I don't know why you wouldn't 
want to inline native_read_tsc everywhere.  I have a feeling it may be a 
relic from unification - possibly because x86-64 was late to the 
clocksource party - but I don't remember anything specific.
I think we can probably make do with a single native_read_tsc, so long 
as its always inlined.
