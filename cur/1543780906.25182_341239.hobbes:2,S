Well I have a small-C runtime library that I put together for
imbedded systems. Once somebody heard that I was using the
"obsolete" int 0x80, they insisted that I re-do everything to
use the new interface. Since I wasn't getting paid to think
on that project, I did what I was told. Bench-marks to 'getpid()'
showed the 0x80 interrupt faster by a few cycles so the "suits"
claimed that I must have done something wrong. So we had a
"code-review".
Finally it was decided; "The CPU must be handling things differently..."
i.e., go back to the simpler int 0x80 interface. It was obvious
to me that any difference in speed was simply noise. Both ways
are essentially the same for performance so I wouldn't lose
any sleep over an "older" 'C' runtime library.
Cheers,
