It should work...

I hope that it only complaints 'matroxfb: cannot ioremap...' without oopsing.

It is guarded by (class != VGA) && (class != IDE) because of devices of
these classes use hardwired I/O port under normal conditions.
matroxfb enables I/O and MMIO itself after correctly configuring rest of
hardware (disabling VGA I/O ports).

I do not think that Millennium II is busmaster capable.

Yes, no-one initialized them.

You are OK. Throw your BIOS away. BIOS MUST assign addresses to all
devices in the box. It MUST NOT enable secondary video adapters, but
must assign addresses to them.

It is unfortunate, that you did not send full output, so I do not know, which
regions are unused... Go to file linux/arch/i386/kernel/bios32.c before
function pcibios_fixup_io_addr and add here (code untested...):
/* cut... */
static void __init pcibios_fixup_mem_addr(struct pci_dev* dev, int idx) {
  static unsigned int base = 0x88000000; /* should be free */
  unsigned int reg = PCI_BASE_ADDRESS0 + 4*idx;
  unsigned int bus = dev->bus->number;
  unsigned int devfn = dev->devfn;
  unsigned short cmd;
  unsigned int size, addr, try;
  if ((bus != 0) || (devfn != 0x98)) return; /* not 00:13.0 */
  if (idx > 2) return;                       /* only base0,1,2 */
  pcibios_read_config_word(bus, devfn, PCI_COMMAND, &cmd);
  pcibios_write_config_word(bus, devfn, PCI_COMMAND, cmd & ~PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY);
  pcibios_write_config_dword(bus, devfn, reg, ~0);
  pcibios_read_config_dword(bus, devfn, reg, &size);
  size = (~(size & ~15)) + 1;
  base = (base + (size - 1)) & ~size;
  /* I hope that bottom four bits are read only */
  pcibios_write_config_dword(bus, devfn, reg, base);
  printk(KERN_INFO "PCI: MMIO %02x:%02x [%d] relocated at %08X\n",
        bus, devfn, idx, base);
  base += size;
  pcibios_write_config_word(bus, devfn, PCI_COMMAND, cmd);
}
/* & paste... */
and then search for call to 'pcibios_fixup_io_addr(drv, i);' :
\Begin
              pcibios_fixup_io_addr(dev, i);
-    } else if (a & PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK)
+    } else if (a & PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK) {
           has_mem = 1;
+          pcibios_fixup_mem_addr(dev, i);
+    }
 }
 /*
\End
Maybe it helps you... But you should bug your motherboard/BIOS author
for fix. BTW, if someone before matroxfb enables I/O and/or MMIO on
Matrox, you must add 'video=matrox:init' parameter to kernel command-line,
otherwise matroxfb thinks that VGA BIOS initialized Matrox properly.
                                            Best regards,
