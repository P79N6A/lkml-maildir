You'll still need to do some *very* basic checking - there's fairly
scary-looking 'outb' call in  callintf_smi()  and host_control_smi() that seems to
be totally too trusting that The Right Thing is located at address CMOS_BASE_PORT:
+		for (index = PE1300_CMOS_CMD_STRUCT_PTR;
+		     index < (PE1300_CMOS_CMD_STRUCT_PTR + 4);
+		     index++) {
+			outb(index,
+			     (CMOS_BASE_PORT + CMOS_PAGE2_INDEX_PORT_PIIX4));
+			outb(*data++,
+			     (CMOS_BASE_PORT + CMOS_PAGE2_DATA_PORT_PIIX4));
+		}
This Dell C840 has an 845, not a PIIX.  What just got toasted if this driver
gets called?
Can we have a check that the machine is (a) a Dell and (b) has a PIIX and (c) the
PIIX has a functional SMI behind it, before we start doing outb() calls?
