yeah, almost - what we want is:
		many insns;
	} else if (...) {
		single insn;
	}

i used to be such a person but got converted: it makes visual sense to 
have symmetry of curly braces. So it's fine to have:
	if (...)
		single insn;
	else
		single insn;
but otherwise, if any of the blocks grows larger than 1 line, it should 
be curly braces all around.
