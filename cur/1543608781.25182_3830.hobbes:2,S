It should be "10 times in at _least_ one second, and at most 5 seconds
apart", but yes, I can imagine that it doesn't work very well if you have
tons of memory.
The problem became more pronounced when we started freeing the swap cache:
it seems that allows the machine to shuffle memory around so efficiently
that I've seen it go for half a minute with vmstat claiming zero IO, and
yet very few out-of-memory messages - I don't know why shrink_cache()
_claims_ success under those circumstances, but I've seen it myself.
Shrink_cache _should_ only return success when it has actually dropped a
page that needs re-loading, but..

Note how you also go for seconds with no IO and no shrinking of the
caches, while shrink_cache() is apparently happy (and no, it does not take
several seconds to traverse even a 16GB inactive queue, there's something
else going on)
With the more aggressive max_mapped, the oom failure count could be
dropped to something smaller, as a false positive from shrink_caches
should be fairly rare. I don't think it needs to be tunable on memory
size, I just didn't even try any other values on my machines (I noticed
that the old values were too high once max_mapped was upped and the swap
cache reclaiming was re-done, but I didn't try if five seconds and ten
failures was any better than 10 seconds and five failures, for example)
