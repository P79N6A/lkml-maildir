Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Updated version:
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/patch-2.6.15-rc7-bird1.bz2
URL of splitup: same place, bird-mbox.
Mostly endianness stuff - finished off befs, killed the minor stuff that
had cropped up since the last (partial) endianness sweep in fs/*, handled
most of nfs and nfsd (that had uncovered several bugs in the latter).
Merged a patch from Alexey that should've been in -rc6-bird3, but had been
missed.
