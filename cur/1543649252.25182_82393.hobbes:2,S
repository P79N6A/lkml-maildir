Subject: 2.5.44 : remove STATIC static ?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello all,
  The following files contain:
#define STATIC static
arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/cris/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/sh/boot/compressed/misc.c
arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/misc.c
drivers/net/irda/donauboe.c
drivers/scsi/53c700.c
drivers/scsi/NCR_D700.c
drivers/scsi/advansys.c
fs/xfs/linux/xfs_linux.h
init/do_mounts.c
Is this macro really needed (for some reason that escapes me), or can we 
remove this macro? It seems to serve as to 'hide' a common keyword. 
Regards,
Frank
