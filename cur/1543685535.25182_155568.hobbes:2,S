Personally, I prefer the european flavour too.
However, a quick count on the original tree shows:
spaans@spaans:~/bk/export$ grep -ir 'flavour' . |wc -l
     74
spaans@spaans:~/bk/export$ grep -ir 'flavor' . |wc -l
    192
which is why I chose to do it this way.
There's no reason to not do it the other way around, of course.
