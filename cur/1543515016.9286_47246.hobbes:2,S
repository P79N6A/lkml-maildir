Fwiw, The O_DIRECTORY hack is still worthwhile even with d_type in some
cases.  Potentially, a filesystem can know that an entry is not a
directory but that cannot be reported in d_type.
I have updated the O_DIRECTORY patch for 2.3.25.  It is a big
improvement :-)  Now I can scan all ~70,000 files starting from / in 50
seconds (I think it was about 2 minutes before).  Much more noticable: I
can scan from / again in 1.3 seconds.
Yes, the kernel manages to cache all that's required for scanning the
names of about 70,000 files over 3 filesystems, totalling 2.5GB.  It
needs 8MB of buffers to do it.  I don't know how much memory goes on
inodes and dentries (slabinfo shows 4788 inode_cache and 6748
dentry_cache).  It couldn't do that before: a repeated scan meant lots
of disk access, just like a fresh scan.
I don't know how much that is due to the dynamic inode table changes
between 2.3.18 and 2.3.25 (I just switched kernel version too), and how
much is due to reading fewer inodes.  There is still quite a lot of
async activity afterwards: that will be writing back the updated atimes.
I would like to avoid updating the atimes for searches like this, and I
have an O_NOATIME patch for that very purpose.  Anyone interested?
Anyway, here is the O_DIRECTORY fast lookup patch.  Only works with
ext2.  The rest don't implement the optimisation, but it could be added
in most cases.
