That would be easy to change if it was desired though, by taking both
namespace semaphores when two namespaces are involved.

That's true.
Let's not get confused between binding across namespaces, and
chroot/chdir into an fd supplied by a process from another namespace.
In the case of bind mount, that _won't_ see changes made in the other
namespace.  The /dentry/ visible in the other namespace is simply
mounted here.  The fact that it happens to come from another namespace
is irrelevant: the other namespace is not used for single dentry bind mounts.
In the case of chroot/chdir, that _will_ see changes made in the other
namespace.  Effectively, that transitions into the other namespace as
a whole, which is exactly what we want in some cases (when userspace
policy determines that a per-session namespace is wanted).

Nice.  The process in the originating namespace can also bind a small,
carefully selected tree of mounts to a tree in that temporary
directory before passing it, so the recipient can chroot/chdir into
the set of mounts and get only those explicitly authorised by the
originating process.
