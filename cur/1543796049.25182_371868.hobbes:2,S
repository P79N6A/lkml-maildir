2.6.14 was released about a month ago... so, to be safe, I'd say about 2 
months ago in cvs...
The idea of a bisection test is to always make your next test based on 
half the amount of changesets... It's not as easy to do this with cvs as 
it is with git, but we can make the best of it......
so, ideally, your tests can be like this:
1- 2months ago.
2- 1month ago
3- 2 weeks ago
4- 3 weeks ago
5- 2 weeks, 3 days ago
6- 2 weeks, 1 day ago
.... at that point, we can look at the cvs commit logs and either
a) start checking out individual patches
or
b) start making the checkout based on time of day in addition of date, 
in the form,
YYYY-MM-DD HH:NN
