As I said to Matt privately, I think adding this kind of ioctl is
ugly. We have enough ioctl's as it is. All Matt is trying to do is to
access drives via location, so exposing location-based device nodes
via devfs is IMNSHO cleaner.
The plan I have (which I hope to get started on soon, now that I'm
back from travels), is to change /dev/scsi/host# from a directory into
a symbolic link to a directory called: /dev/bus/pci0/slot1/function0.
Thus, to access a partition via location, one would use the path:
/dev/bus/pci0/slot1/function0/bus0/target1/lun2/part3.
