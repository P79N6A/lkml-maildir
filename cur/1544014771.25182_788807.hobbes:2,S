Subject: [PATCH 09/10] NOMMU: Teach kobjsize() about VMA regions. [ver #3]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/8/146

From: Paul Mundt <lethal@linux-sh.org>
Now that we no longer use compound pages for all large allocations,
kobjsize() actively breaks things like binfmt_flat by always handing
back PAGE_SIZE for mmap'ed regions. Fix this up by looking up the
VMA region for non-compounds.
Ideally binfmt_flat wants to get rid of kobjsize() completely, but
this is an incremental step.
