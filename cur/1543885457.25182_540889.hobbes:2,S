Yes, the new implemantation should work correctly.
However, this particular case was already fixed earlier,
	workqueue-make-cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue-work-on-idle-dwork.patch
	
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm-commits&m=117081275901499
Note that INIT_DELAYED_WORK() sets work->data = 0, and
cancel_rearming_delayed_work() does "Was it ever queued"
check.
Still, before this patch, cancel_rearming_delayed_work() hangs
if this work was used before, but not active + re-arming now.
