Looking at the Biostar pages I am still not completely convinced that
your CPU/MB combo is supported. At least it is not listed there.
So far TA770 A2+ SE, rev. 6.X, is listed. Did the Biostar folks confirm you
that your mobo model/revision is supported, too?

Looks good so far.

This reminds me of some system hangs with older kernels when C1E was
activated.
Can you please try to boot with idle=poll, or idle=mwait, or nolapic_timer
when using 2.6.26.X?
Can you also try to boot .27 or .28?
Thanks,
Andreas
