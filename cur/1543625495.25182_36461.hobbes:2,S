Hello Oleg,
detailed investigation showed the following interesting results:
1) the problem is not dependant on any nfs-flags, whatever I try it shows up
2) the problem _is_ dependant on the fs mounted in the following form:
mounting two fs that are located on the _same_ reiserfs _works_.
mounting two fs that are located on _different_ reiserfs _does not work_.
How about that?
Regards,
Stephan
