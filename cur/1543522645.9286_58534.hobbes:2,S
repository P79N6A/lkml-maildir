Hi Linus, hi All,
  I know that you are busy with todays revealing of Transmeta
secrets, but... could you, please, apply this patch into
Linux kernel? ncpfs is really angry without it.
  Patch is for 2.3.40-pre6. I sent you simillar for inclusion
into 2.3.40-pre5, but you did not applied it, apparently.
				Thanks,
