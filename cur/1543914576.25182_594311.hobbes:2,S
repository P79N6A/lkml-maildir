Subject: RFC [PATCH] menuconfig: distinguish between selected-by-another options and comments (resend)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/14/82

menuconfig currently represents options implied by another option ('select'
directive in Kconfig) by prefixing them with '---'. Unfortunately the same
notation is used for comments. If the implied option is module capable,
user can still switch between Y and M, all without any feedback until she
visits option's help. (try saying M to MAC80211 and then toggling CFG80211)
This patch changes notation of selected-by-another items by introducing 2 new
representations for implied options:
{*} or {M} for options selected by another modularized one, thus builtin or
module capable,
-*- or -M- for options that cannot be at the moment changed by user.
The idea is to represent actual capability of the option by braces (dashes)
around and to always report actual state by * or M inside.

Hi list,
after being a little annoyed by menuconfig not showing me current state of 
selected-by-another options (which were looking as comments), I made up a 
little patch to help users tell these 2 things apart.
I'd like to hear your comments especially concerning the following:
 * English grammar and style in new menuconfig README (I'm non-native english 
speaker)
 * the way to present the new combinations to user (currently I use "{ }" 
and "- -", which may be replaced by something more sexy and clear)
 * the use of "if (sym->rev_dep.tri == mod)". It seems inappropriate to use 
something from struct symbol directly, as all other uses of it are 
abstracted.
TODO is to also change legend text in menuconfig's window header.
Regards,
         Matěj Latil
