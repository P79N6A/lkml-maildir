Yep, the flags field should be able to do that for you. Since we have
the handle_mm_fault wrapper for machine faults, it isn't too hard to
change the arguments: we should probably turn `write_access` into a
flag so we don't have to push too many arguments onto the stack.
This way we can distinguish get_user_pages faults. And your
architecture will have to switch over to using __handle_mm_fault, and
distinguish kernel faults. Something like that?
