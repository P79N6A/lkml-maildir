i've released the v2.6.23-rc1-rt0 kernel, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
as the rt0 name suggests it, this is a devel release, the first one 
after a rebase to 2.6.23-rc1. There's lots of changes and a reduction of 
50 patches (we are now at 320 patches) - so code from -rt is moving 
upstream at a steady pace. (latest bigger chunks that moved were CFS, 
lockstat, most of the -hrt queue, plus various fixes)
more info about the -rt patchset can be found in the RT wiki:
  
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org
to build a 2.6.22.1-rt5 tree, the following patches should be applied:
