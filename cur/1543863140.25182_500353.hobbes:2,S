Could I ask you what precisely is the driver you are talking about doing? 
Why is it not going to be a part of mainline kernel (i.e. being able to be 
put on blacklist easily).

Sure, there are such in-kernel drivers ... for example Wacom driver. This 
driver is in-kernel, and it is hooked inside the usb_hid_configure() 
function to be ignored by the HID layer completely, and all the driver 
specific handling is handled in drivers/usb/input/wacom*.
(When looking at that code, it looks quite ugly by the way. I have no idea 
why wacom driver is not using HID_QUIRK_IGNORE, but has a hardcoded hook 
in the usb_hid_configure() instead. I will probably fix this.)
