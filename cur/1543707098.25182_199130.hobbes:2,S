I recommend Dan Kegel's page for anyone trying to build a cross compiler
to linux.  See
	
http://kegel.com/crosstool
This isn't very hard to follow, and it gives you a properly configured
and built gcc/glibc for the target.
I don't recommend the inhibit_libc trick for building linux crosses.  It
may work well enough for kernel builds, but it will give you a subtly
broken gcc, and that may lead to confusion later.
