I have a problem now.
I'm not able to reproduce the bug on an IBM xSeries box.
CPU: Dual Core 3.8 Ghz
RAM: 1 GB
The big difference in the configuration is that the laptop read data from a 
USB HDD and copied it to another USB HDD (dm-crypted)
The IBM box reads it from an NFS share and copies it to the local hdd 
(dm-crypted)
