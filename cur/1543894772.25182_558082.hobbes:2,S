Well tabs should _never_ be assumed to be 8, and in this regard, as I 
see it, CodingStyle has a bug. Tabs are there so that the user can set 
their width according to _their_ taste, simply so that both sides,
	from CodingStyle:
	Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8
	characters.  There are heretic movements that try to make
	indentations 4 (or even 2!) characters deep, and that is akin
	to trying to define the value of PI to be 3.
Linus (did he wrote that part?) and the heretics both can have their fun 
without impacting each other. If we wanted to force the user to have 
exactly 8 screen blanks, we should use spaces throughout.
(And BTW,  int pi = 3.141592 _is_ going to be 3 ;-) and floating point 
is mostly an agreed no-go in kernel anyway, even if it's supported.)
