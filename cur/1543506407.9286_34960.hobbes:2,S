From then on, after every install of a module it checks if any of the

Seems to me you won't gain much if you allow loading and initialization
of
a module and only rely on a periodic check to see if it messed up the
syscall table.
A crack module could do anything during initialization.  It could set
ADDITIONS_ALLOWED
in your module.  It could search memory for your stored syscall table
and patch
that one too.   Or you could force crackers to modify something else
instead
of the syscall table.  The obvious crack workaround is to overwrite the
syscall
destinations adresses instead.
For better module security, allow only modules that is known to be ok.
Consider encrypting your modules using pgp or something.  Then have the
compiled-in module loader decrypt and verify the module before
initializing it.  A cracker would be unable to produce a new encrypted
module or tamper with an existing one.
Not that this would help that much.  The root crackers don't need
modules,
that's merely a convenience for hiding easily.  They could replace
ps, top, etc. instead.  They could replace libc.  They could unmount
/proc
and mount a loop device in its place, with a process updating the now
artifical /proc.
