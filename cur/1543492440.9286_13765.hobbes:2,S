Heh, you've gone a long way from 'this is cool!' to 'just plain broken'
;-)  No matter: the answer to your question is you _don't_ under this
scheme.  (well, there's some kind of perl setuid thing, but that's another
matter)  This is for ELF executables only, which fortunately are the rule
rather than the exception.  Scripts will have to wait for FS support, and
setuid scripts will break with all the standard tools + nfs.  I did forget
to mention in my last post: if caps are present in the FS, ignore whatever
you find in the binary.

The meaning of 'setuid 0' is outdated, this is a better way to use it.
