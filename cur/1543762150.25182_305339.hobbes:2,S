No. I am not worried about driver being possibly defective etc.
This happens. I am mostly unhappy with this possibly defective
drive being able to solidly lock up a Linux system!
(Linux is on *hda*, I don't think it's ok for IO problems
on *hdc* to affect hda and overall system stability).
Unfortunately, the disk promptly stopped misbehaving.
I'll keep an eye on it, tho.
