So it seems my initial debugging report was, err, incomplete. I failed to 
notice that the amd_apic_timer_broken function was getting called twice, 
once for each core.
The second call shows this:
  MSR_K8_ENABLE_C1E == 0x14c14015
which causes our ENABLE_C1E_MASK check to be true and thus properly 
return 1 from the function. So when we call the above function from 
init_amd we prolly need to do a
  set_bit(X86_FEATURE_LAPIC_TIMER_BROKEN, c->x86_capability);
for each core if any of them happen to return true upon checking for a 
broken timer.
Andi, does that seem right?
