It is a newly installed system - 2.6.15-rc6 has been the first kernel at 
all on this machine - this kernel crashed too. After that I upgraded to 
2.6.15-rc7 - it crashed as written in the initial mail. Next was to 
apply the libata1 patch. It did not give a kernel panic but shut down 
the SATA subsystem (the hardware is a Promise SATA II 300 TX4 PDC 20718 
and an onboard Promise SATA II 150 PDC20579) - non of the six attached 
disks has been accessible anymore after calling hddtemp on one of the 
disks which have been in standby. Calling hddtemp on a spinning disk 
works without a problem.
A further problem is that calling "hdparm -C" _always_ give "drive state 
is:  standby" - even when the disks are clearly active. Maybe this 
indicates something to you.
I can try to downgrade to 2.6.14 if you like. I started with 2.6.15 
because I have been told it is the first kernel which is able to deal 
with "hdparm -S x" / "hdparm -y" for SATA devices.

Thanks.
