the light dawned... of course it doesn't say.  If you have userlevel
threads (or some M:N system), either you force the threading library
to reimplement the fcntl lock interface, or they have to share locks.
I can't imagine that even the posix threading people require a
reimplementation of the grotesque solaris file locking scheme in
userspace.
