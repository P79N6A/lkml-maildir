Gabriele,
I ignored your patch because:
1. I do not believe you have the 3w-xxxx driver running on an
   alpha SMP system.
2. I removed the bitfields from the 3w-xxxx driver but I have
   yet to add full big endian support due to lack of demand.  I have
   such a patch for this driver (which already includes the unpacking
   of the wait_queue_head_t variable) but I have not submitted it to
   the main-line kernel.  The in-kernel 3w-xxxx driver is still missing
   the byte-swaps.
   The 3w-9xxx (9000 series 3ware driver) has full big endian support.
3. Your patch was garbled.
Is this an official request for big endian support for the 3w-xxxx driver or
are you looking for anybody who has a packed 'wait_queue_head_t' and
submitting a patch to fix it?
