Well the initial approach was to put the minimum functionality
in-kernel and drive it all from userspace.  I that proved to
be inadequate then the kernel-side might need to be grown.
I'd expect that a defrag would be a batch process which is done
during quiet times.  Although one _could_ have a `defragd' which
ticks along all the time I suppose.
A defragmentation algorithm probably would not be a "per file" thing;
it would need to gather a fair amount of state about the fs, or
at least an individual block group before starting to shuffle things.
