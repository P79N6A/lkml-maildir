Tivo gets sick of the endless flamewars on lkml, signs a copy
of QNX, pushes it out to the hardware.  No more Linux on Tivo.
You also can't replace that but Tivo can.  As I see it the two
are completely orthagonal:
a) Can anyone but the manufacturer upload new software into a
   a device without taking extreme measures (soldering a new
   public-key-containing-chip onto the board)
b) Is the software currently installed on a device licenced under
   a rule which requires the distributor to also distribute source
   code upon request.
Now I think it would reasonable to ask that the source code be able
to be built by [same compiler, same flags, same ...] to produce an
identical binary to the one running on the device so you can confirm
that it's exactly the same code.  That's separate from being able to
upload a changed binary.
