this reminds me of another issue: x86_64 currently seems to manually map
the whole module via PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC. Andi, we could change it to use
vmalloc_exec(), right?
and yet another sub-topic: when building modules we should align .rodata
(the first non-executable section) to page boundary. This adds ~2K to
the module size but it's not an issue i think. Data section overflows do
happen and if it has a function pointer that can be used as a trampoline
then we want the whole data section to be non-executable.
