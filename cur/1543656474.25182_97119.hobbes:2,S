You're for the most part SOL unless you can either hack the support or
can wait for it to be finished. More details below.

Try 2.5.52-mm1 + 2.5.52-wli-1. The -wli bits are orthogonal but they do
a small bit to reduce the cpu inefficiencies of many task loads.
-wli is actually maintenance and follow-through on various early 2.5
promises.
proc_pid_readdir() is the cpu culprit, which I have not yet addressed.
You are also going to have severe memory management problems due to the
number of L2 and L3 pagetables created as well as kernel stacks.
2.5.52-mm1 will have 2 of 3 possible things that can be done about L3
pagetables. L2 pagetables limit you to 64K processes with more practical
limits around 16K. As 16K is feasible here, you are running the wrong
kernel version(s).
