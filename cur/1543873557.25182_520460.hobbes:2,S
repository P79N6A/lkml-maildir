ACPI_BAY is experimental, ibm-acpi bay handling is not.  In fact, ACPI_BAY
will debut in mainline in 2.6.21, ibm-acpi bay handling sort of works since
2.6.10.
I hope to have something much better than this stopgap patch for 2.6.22, and
to deprecate ibm-acpi bay (or have it working in *cooperation* with
ACPI_BAY) for 2.6.23.

That's the plan, yes.  Failing that, we shall attempt to make both drivers
cooperate (not only load together, but actually work together).
