No, it was more the comment that was irritating me.

I just remember reading some document which said that using too many
locks is not a good idea. Well I guess you're prepared for bug reports

Sounds good, they are unused in the Freescale BSP aswell-

No indeed not. My concern is that of these 137 interrupts only 7 are
used in the Freescale BSP which shoud be quite feature complete.
I think we should check the potential use of these interrupts before
adding ~10k of struct irq_desc to the kernel.
What about the *_EOF interrupts? They are now demultiplexed in a chained
interrupt handler and then merged back together to a single handler in
ipu_idmac.c. Is there a potential use of these interrupts outside this file?
I just had a short look at your framebuffer driver. Am I understanding
it right that you setup two descriptors and pass them to the DMA engine
alternately? Wouldn't it be easier to pass just one descriptor and chain
the end to the beginning? I mean both descriptors read from the same
memory anyway.
Another thing is the overlay framebuffer. I think it's mainly useful to
display video streams. Maybe it's better to implement this as a v4l
device as unlike the framebuffer API the v4l API is designed to handle
different image buffers.
These things just popped up in my mind, I don't know if they are
practical, I still have a quite limited understanding of the whole
imaging stuff on the MX31.
