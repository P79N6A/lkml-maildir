Take a look at those options. :)  I added one to tweak TASK_SIZE
from the PPC default of 0x80000000.
I've run a system with a TASK_SIZE of 1GB, MAX_LOW_MEM at 16MB,
PAGE_OFFSET at 0x40000000, and HIGHMEM on with the PKMAP_BASE
placed up higher than the default 0xfe000000 (with a 1GB of RAM
installed) to allow for close to 3GB of vmalloc space.  Certain
embedded systems with large PCI windows (like non-transparent
bridges, for example) gobble up vmalloc space pretty darn quickly.
This is just getting worse with RapidIO on a 32-bit processor.
