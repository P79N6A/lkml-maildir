Of course.
But clearly the author of this patch thought it useful
to introduce this behaviour. And it certainly does not harm.
[What does harm a little bit however, is the fact that we wrap.
For security reasons I would much prefer a 31-bit pid.
However, Linus did not apply my (trivial) patch, not sure precisely why,
perhaps just 2.4 freeze. It is a good time now, now that ipc problems
have been cleared up.]
