With my patch, fcntl will return -1 and set errno to EINVAL. It is up
to the mail proram to detect this condition and proceed accordingly.
BTW, it is requred by POSIX to return EINVAL if file locking is not
available for the file desrcriptor.

If it happens, it is caused by the broken mail proram.

It is irrelevant to my patch. My patch fixes a POSIX bug.
