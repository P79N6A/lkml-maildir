You can find more and more keyboards with extra keys, such as media
players control keys (Start, Stop, Pause, etc.), sleep and so on.
The problem is: the scancodes won't even show on a showkey -s!
The question is: what to change and where? I'd like the kernel to at
least tell "Unknown scancode: <the_scancode>", but how can I do that?
On kernels 2.2.x and 2.3.x
