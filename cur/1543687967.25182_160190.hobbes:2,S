Likewise, my EPoX 8RDA+ board is working 100% perfectly since the nforce2-apic 
fixes were merged in -mm. No spurious interrupts, no weird ACPI glitches, 
everything from power management to PCI IRQ routing is just fine.
I'm still not sure I understand the local apic lockups experienced by others, 
but anybody considering the purchase of an nForce 2 board can probably put 
their mind to rest.

With the 1000Hz timer in linux 2.6, I'd guess your PC had been up for 
516847/1000/60 = 8.61 minutes.. Oh, look!

Evidently not.
