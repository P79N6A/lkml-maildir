Gahh, and I just built -18 but amanda is running so can't reboot 
anyway.  This is my night to do a graveyard at the tv transmitter so 
it'll be the middle of the day Saturday before I get one eye open 
simultainiously again.  -19 wasn't there 3 or 4 hours ago.
Thanks, I report back when I have done it.
