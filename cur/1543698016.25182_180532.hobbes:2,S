Due to the really hard drugs the processor designers must have been
on, the only way to implement this is via the particularly nasty flavor
of segmentation on Intel processors (sane forms just use bits in pointers).
c.f. pax and exec-shield for examples of how to do it in Linux (please
do not start that debate; the only relevant point here is they use the
segmentation stuff). I suspect OpenBSD might also implement it.
