So I'm trying to get the Intel PowerTop stuff working, and discovered that /
proc/timer_stats and/or /proc/tstats has moved to /debug in -mm2 - but only if
you're building for S390.  For other architechtures it just evaporates
entirely.  I had to bash this patch in to get it to get included in an x86_64
build:

Am just replicating the choice to put it in arch/s390/Kconfig - not sure why
it was in there rather than lib/Kconfig.debug - is there a reason here?
Having bashed *that* into place, I hit this at kernel link time:
