Good, the problem is identified:
The old flip buffer code can't keep up unless
it processes received data directly in
the ISR (2.6.9 or 2.6.10+ with low_latency)
instead of in scheduled work (2.6.10+ without low_latency).
The discarded receive chars causes dropped frames
in ppp_async and stalls in data transfer.
I don't remember the details, but I think it is
safe to run low_latency on a uniprocessor.

Alan's new tty buffering code safely handles
high receive rates without data loss, so the
low_latency flag is not necessary.

The fix is already present in 2.6.16 series, so there
is nothing to patch. If you wish to run 2.6.10-2.6.15
you should be able to safely use low_latency on
a uniprocessor machine.
