Question - is hardware APM suspend supported in any current available
kernel/apmd? I ask this because when I press the power button on my
computer, which is supposed to do a hardware suspend (according to my
BIOS) and I'm in X, the screen basically turns to garbage and I can't do
anything except reset/poweroff my computer.
