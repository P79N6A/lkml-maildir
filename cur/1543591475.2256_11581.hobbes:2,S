<sarcasm>Oh, sure.  The CML2 NEWS file is ample proof of that.</sarcasm>
OK, Jes, you've just demonstrated that you're blind to facts and can't 
be reasoned with.  I'll continue listening to everybody else as I've

The whole of the Bill [of Rights] is a declaration of the right of the
people at large or considered as individuals...  It establishes some
rights of the individual as unalienable and which consequently, no
majority has a right to deprive them of.
