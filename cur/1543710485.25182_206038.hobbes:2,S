Ingo, Hi
We tried it (2.6.4) our side. As long as we tested, we did not need _any
changes_ to the kernel tree, and I guess what you are missing is a shell
script that calls icc converting the GCC specific options to Intel
compiler.
Attached is the script. Just type "make CC=kicc" for example.
Can you be more specific about the issue with dec_and_lock.c?
