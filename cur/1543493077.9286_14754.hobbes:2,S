Depending on what the benchmark is, some of these _can_ have a quite
noticeable difference.
For example, if the benchmark consists of web-serving 50.000 different
small files, you want to make sure that you can have all of them cached
at the same time.  So you probably want to increase inode-max quite
noticeably. 
I agree that you should not need to touch any of the values for any REAL
WORLD benchmark.  But some of them can certainly be an issue for the
above kind of loads that aren't very realistic.

And make sure you log as little as humanly possible.  In particular,
older versions of apache did reverse name lookups etc, which just killed
performance.
