No, I have no port specific rules in the firewall (iptables), but this
machine does SNAT for 32 other linux boxes which also get some directories
from the same server (including YP). I had some trouble with the
YPSERV-calls until I bound two more IPs to the network card and
masqueraded the 32 boxes via these additional addresses. What might happen
is that the specific port gets allocated by some port remapping in
iptables during the request, but I don't see why this should happen only
for specific directories (e.g. /home works and /compass doesn't while
both are from the same server).
