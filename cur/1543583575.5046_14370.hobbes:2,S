Hi,
I want to add a function defined in my loadeble kernel module as system
call.
I know the procedure regarding how to add a system call permanently into
the kernel. But, doesn't know regarding how to add it for kernel loadable 
module.
I will be thankful, if you can provide me any info/pointers.
Thanks,
Madhu
