I read in Documentation/kmod.txt that kmod is preferred over kerneld, is
'kmod' a part of the linux kernel or is it a separate program like
'kerneld'? and if it is a separate program, from where can I download it
? and if it were a part of linux kernel, is it inside the kernel, so it is 
loaded when I start linux, or is it a module to load or what ?
thanks...
