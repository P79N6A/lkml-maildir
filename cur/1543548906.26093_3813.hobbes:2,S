For a good many people, yes it does work.  For this hardware it doesn't work.
pcmcia_core and yenta_socket are the only two modules I can load, and once
loaded they can't be unloaded.  Trying to rmmod yenta_socket yeilds a segfault
and the module remains in a (deleted) state.
The kernel pcmcia can't get the sockets set up correctly.  It used to work; on 1
socket only and randomly blew up the kernel.  The other socket hung the
interrupts.
