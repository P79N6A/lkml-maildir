It is of course possible to build it as a modules. That is what I do. But 
it would be guaranteed to work only if NLS was enabled during the previous 
kernel compile and even then you would still have to do the make 
{old,menu,x,}config, followed by make dep and make modules. On a fast 
mashine you might as well do the make bzImage, too... - Also it would only 
work if you are compiling the modules on the same kernel with the same 
config as the currently running kernel.
Also, the original poster said he was using RedHat 6.2, which means he is 
probably using a 2.2.x kernel as that came with RedHat 6.2 and considering 
he doesn't want to recompile the kernel chances are he has some ancient 
2.2.x kernel at that (whatever came standard with 6.2 + eventual updates...).
So it would be a good idea to get at least 2.4.4 kernel and then yes, you 
would have to compile it from scratch...
