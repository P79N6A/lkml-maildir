Subject: [PATCH] x86-64: Fix bad assumption that dualcore cpus have synced TSCs (resend)

Andrew,
	This patch should resolve the issue seen in bugme bug #5105, where it
is assumed that dualcore x86_64 systems have synced TSCs. This is not
the case, and alternate timesources should be used instead.
For more details, see:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5105
Andi's earlier concerns that the TSCs should be synced on dualcore
systems have been resolved by confirmation from AMD folks that they can
be unsynced.
Please consider for inclusion in your tree.
thanks
