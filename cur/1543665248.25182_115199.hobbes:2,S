i believe this is rather due to IO scheduling / VM throttling. Andrew 
added some nice improvements lately, so this should really not happen with

okay, could you please test BK-curr, or 2.5.64+combo-patch? Do the skips
still persist? Did they get worse perhaps? I guess it might take a few
days of music listening while doing normal desktop activity, to get a good
feel of it though.
