Hello,
I have released a new version of the GNU-EFI package.
This package is used to build EFI applications on Linux
for both IA-32 and IA-64 architectures.
This is a maintenance release with no new features just
updates to support the latest GNU compilers:
	- updated linker scripts to support latest gcc sections.
	  Provided by H.J. Lu from Intel. Special thanks to Jim Wilson
	  for his help.
	- updated library to compile cleanly with gcc4.1.
	  Provided by Raymund Will from SuSE
I have tested the package on Linux/ia64 with Debian gcc-4.0.3
and binutils 2.16.91. With this, you can build a working elilo3.6.
It compiles on Debian/i386 with gcc 4.0.3 and binutils 2.6.91.
I dot have the setup to test i386 efi
binaries.
You can grab the package at:
	
ftp://ftp.hpl.hp.com/pub/linux-ia64/gnu-efi-3.0c.tar.gz
	MD5SUM: 823e5f04d1c0a7b88831f91fbf12d470
This is the last gnu-efi release that I manage. I am handing over
the maintenance of the package to Nigel Croxon from HP. Please forward
any new questions to him from now on. He is copied on this announcement.
Thanks.
