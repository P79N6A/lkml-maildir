Hi everyone,
this is my first post to this ML so please be kind :-) !
I'm an italian user of the Linux system and I'm a student of a
Computer Science Engineering. At the moment I'm attending a course
called "Operating Systems" in which we make an in-depth study of the
Linux kernel.
Final Exam of this course consist in both a practical project and a
written test. While I don' expect you to help me survive to the
written test, I'd like you to give me some suggestion and directions
to develop a kernel improvement project.
I don't want to make some accademic&not-usable project, but rather a
project the Linux Kernel community would appreciate and use.
So, which parts of the Kernel need an improvement ? Direct me to some
Web site too.
The project must refer to kernel 2.2.x and i386 platform.
Thank you !
