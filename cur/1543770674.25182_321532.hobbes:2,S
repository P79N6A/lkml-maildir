I seem to have gotten you rather excited, you've actually gone as far as 
creating a strawman argument for my allegedly "strawman" statement. What 
i originally stated was that media applications are not common place as far 
as _hard_ realtime systems are concerned, this was in reply to Bill's 
emphasis on media applications. Now i'm not trying to undermine the 
audiophiles' goals or aspirations and i do indeed see the benefits for 
them but in the event of Linux becoming an RTOS, the main fields 
of interest wouldn't be from media application providers (even if there 
certainly will be an increase in their interest).

Terribly sorry old bean, but Linux isn't the center of the universe. I'm 
afraid Linux wasn't the push factor which led to the proliferation of 
multiprocessor systems.

No, i never said that, please look at the original statement and the 
context to which it was based on.
