I can now make it work, most of the time.
Compile 2.0.37 as UP. After the system comes up, ifconfig the interface
down and then back up. It still spits out a couple of Transmitter Stopped!
errors but otherwise I can at least ping the other machines on the net.
This is with the driver compiled into the kernel.
I have the tulip-diag program, wish I know more about how to use it to
provide some more meaningful information that might help make a better
driver.
