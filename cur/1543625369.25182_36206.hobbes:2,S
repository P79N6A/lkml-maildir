Dear Maciej,
thanks for your comments and the patch. I overlooked that NMI watchdog
thing. I'll test it, although I am certain that it'll fix our problem.
Btw, we _have_ already fixed our BIOS (at least on my test machine).
I just submitted the patch because I thought that Linux putting the
8259A in polling mode is also a dangerous thing that should be avoided
if possible. You have shown me that there are some more situations where
it is impossible than I had seen.
Many people seem to think our BIOS is particularly nasty. I'd like to
repeat that this is a pretty common Phoenix BIOS. Of course I can't tell
what other manufacturers do, but I'd consider it at least possible that
their BIOS's act similarly.
Martin
