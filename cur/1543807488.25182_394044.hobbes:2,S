That naming _has_ to change.
"exec" has a very clear meaning in unix: it talks about the notion of 
switching to another process image, or perhaps the bit that says that a 
file contains an image that can be executed. It has nothing to do with 
"current".
What you seem to be talking about is the _effective_ environment. Ie the 
same way we have "uid" and "euid", you'd have a "container" and the 
"effective container".
The "owner" name also makes no sense. The security context doesn't "own" 
tasks. A task is _part_ of a context.
So if some people don't like "container", how about just calling it 
"context"? The downside of that name is that it's very commonly used in 
the kenel, because a lot of things have "contexts". That's why "container" 
would be a lot better.
I'd suggest
	current->container	- the current EFFECTIVE container
	current->master_container - the "long term" container.
(replace "master" with some other non-S&M term if you want)
(It would make sense to just have the prepend-"e" semantics of uid/gid, 
but the fact is, "euid/egid" has a long unix history and is readable only 
for that reason. The same wouldn't be true of containers. And 
"effective_container" is probably too long to use for the field that is 
actually the _common_ case. Thus the above suggestion).
