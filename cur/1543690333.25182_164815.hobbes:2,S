Similarly, I often ctrl-z the configure step, and when fging the
process again, things end up a bit strange - IIRC, it goes to the next
menu level up from the current one, and sometimes ends up with strange
keystrokes? It's been a while since I have tried, so I can't quite
recall the details, sorry.
Probably not quite so easy to fix as the solution to this one,
unfortuneately :(
