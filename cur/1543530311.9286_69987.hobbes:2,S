It happens here too and I noticed it happens when I have more than one
device (my net card) on the same IRQ of the psaux port. Question: can the
psaux port only have the IRQ 12 ? Why is it hardcoded in the source ?
I played a bit with my BIOS (here I have a P3BF mainboard) and managed
that ps2 device is the only device with irq 12, and now everything works
correctly.
