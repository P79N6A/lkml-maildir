I still run into the pdflush problem once a month or so, but only with
boxes that are up for a week or more.  It usually takes the box down if
for no other reason than it's too busy prink()ing to do anything else. 
I haven't been able to sysrq it and the particular box that it happens
on doesn't like NMIs so kgdb and the NMI oopser are out.
Are there any good reasons not to do something like the attached patch? 
It would at least keep pdflush from evicting everthing interesting that
may have preceded it in dmesg.
