Good point. Generally, video devices starts with an open volume when the
user opens the video application. After closed, it turns off audio. In
fact, for most applications, this is really not important, since default
is also stored at the application itself. If we compare with a TV set,
when people turn TV on, they expect to listen something.
About cx88, in the past, we were starting with a low volume, but people
complained that this is bad, since they don't know for sure if the audio
is working fine.
If we decide to change to start without volume, we will need to patch
all other devices, since current V4L default is to start at maximum
volume (except for msp3400, that starts at about 90% of max scale, due
troubles with maximum volume on some boards).
