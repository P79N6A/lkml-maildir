We cannot include the full trace in the syslog - it's possibly thousands
of lines long.

well, the mouse could stop moving for a number of reasons. It's handled
via the X server and if the X server is preempted (for whatever reason)
then the mouse pointer isnt updated.
you could try to change the mouse IRQ to be non-threaded. Also, do you
have kernel_preemption set to 1? It defaults to 0.
