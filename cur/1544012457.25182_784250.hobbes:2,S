Hi!
in-tree documentation says that default for ext3 is errors=remount-ro,
and that's sensible, but I see errors=continue on my disks, due to
superblock settings. (Maybe documentation should mention that?)
I don't know where errors=continue came from (and I think its
dangerous); mkfs does not seem to have such option, nor can I see
anything in /etc/mke2fs.conf...
