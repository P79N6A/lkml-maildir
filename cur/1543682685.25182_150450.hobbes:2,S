: include/asm-generic/errno.h says that 75 is EOVERFLOW.
: Now look in Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt and it says that
: EOVERFLOW is used for:
: -EOVERFLOW (*)		The amount of data returned by the endpoint was
: 			greater than either the max packet size of the
: 			endpoint or the remaining buffer size.  "Babble".
: 
: The device returned too much data.
: See whichever host controller driver you are using for details.
Strange.  Thanks.  For some reason I was thinking those error codes returned
by the driver were more specific to it.  I see where the message is generated
and now just need to figure out what the deal is with it here.  It works fine
under at least two other OSes so I know the keyboard works.
