Tape needs special multipathing logic.  Don't you think moving
multipathing to the mid-layer requires the mid-layer to know much more
about the upper layer and muddles up the scsi stack's layering?  To keep
multipathing high and generic we need better error reporting than the
one bit that hits the md layer in 2.4...
