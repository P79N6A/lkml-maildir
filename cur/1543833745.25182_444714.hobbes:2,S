Problem solved!

Okay, the wait percentage is no problem, but the speed is.
I had to use a second power supply for two of the four SATA disks,
because the main supply is not good enough and causes crashes and
reboots (see my other threads, I will answer there too).
In a test that checked each disk seperately I noticed that exactly those
disks connected to the second power supply perform very poor with write
accesses (65 MB/sec vs. 2 MB/sec). I replaced the second (bad) power
supply with a very good one and now all disks are working fine. My new
main power supply should arrive soon.
I still can't understand why disks work slower when provided with
"wrong" power... The disks are Maxtor MaXLine III 7V300F0.

Yeah, the kernel is okay :)
PS: Now a very annoying hunt for some error in my computer ends after
about three weeks. The system now is stable and fast and I am happy...
Bye and sorry for bugging you,
