To shorten my reply from one post to two:
I wasn't aware the lookup race had been fixed.  Silly me.  As to the
number of results for the terms I used, I was looking for that specific
post, as I'd cited it before.  'devfs deadlock' also returns plenty of
good (and irrelevant)  results at that same archive.

Given akpm's track record and, the fact that he's going to be maintaining
2.6, his word is enough for me.  But...

One should do one's own research.  If I'd done my own better, I would've
found a better example than the one I posted previously.  However, since
you seem unwilling or unable to do your own homework, and I have nearly
unlimited free time until next Monday, here's some more:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103696697201341&w=2
Some parts of that post have been fixed.  I haven't taken the time to read
the rest of the thread (I don't remember that thread being very long).
However, I'm all but positive the problems Viro points out in this post
still apply:  
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107223747630894&w=2
These posts are out there and they are _not_ hard to find at all.  That
last one was from about two weeks ago.  The other is much older, and I'd
have to do some digging in ugly, ugly code to find points that still
apply.  However, as I started this paragraph by saying, this stuff isn't
hard to find at all.
Please consider doing your own homework.  It's not like discussion of
devfs and its problems has been rare.
Thank you.
