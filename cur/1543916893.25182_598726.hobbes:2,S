That is the same as you try to read once more after an expired timer. You 
won't wake up until the next timer event will show up. That is, after at 
most TP time for periodic timers, or after the time  the next 
timerfd_settime() will setup.
I'd like to keep the "timerfd not set yet" and the "timerfd already 
expired and not re-armed" acting the same way. That is, wait till next 
event happen (unless O_NONBLOCK of course).
