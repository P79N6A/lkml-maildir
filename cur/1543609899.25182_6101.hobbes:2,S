YES! Kill this bastard (the best of all is to use rm(1), then reboot).

Dunno how, but usbkbd often manages to disable hid.
Never let it get built. We do have reports of people who
have keyboards not working with hid, very infrequently.
Of course, those guys prefer just to build usbkbd than to
help figuring why hid does not work. If not for that,
usbkbd would be removed from kernel sources long ago.
