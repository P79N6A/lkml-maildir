This is utterly wrong. I'm going to say this only once. Devfs allows
for automatic notification of device changes as well as any inode
changes or lookups. All notification is done via $DEVFS/.devfsd
without a single extra syscall, and the data transferred is very
compact.
Horst, you are entitled to your opinions on the merits (or not) of
devfs. But you continue to make statements about how devfs "works",
which are not based in reality. I don't know where you get these ideas
from. Many of your "descriptions" of how devfs works are not only
totally different from how *my* devfs works, they are very different
from how I would conceive *any* devfs to work.
You do this time and time again. I don't know if it's deliberate FUD,
or simply that you've never bothered to read the FAQ or the source.
But I do know that so often when you describe how devfs "works", it is
completely wrong. I'm getting really tired of this.

I've exaplained this before.

It's done *NOW*. It *WORKS*. Configure devfsd and observe!

I've been through all this.

This is all untrue, as I've said time and again. No "oodles" of
ioctl()s or syscalls. A handful of pages for devfs code and data.

This again is untrue. I've explained this elsewhere.
