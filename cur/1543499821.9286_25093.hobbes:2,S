I thought mine might be hardware related, but I have not been able to
duplicate any problems 2.2.5.  For one test, I've been running a kernel
compile burn-in script which basically runs "make -j4" and compares the
output from run to run - I got it when I had one of the buggy AMD K6
chips.  After that, I've tried to only get quality stuff.  I had power
supply troubles, so I got a good PC Power & Cooling Turbo Cool power
supply.  I got name brand memory (can't remember _which_ brand :-) )
after I had some suspect RAM.  After that, my system has run virtually
flawlessly for 6-9 months now.  Until I put 2.2.9 and then 2.2.10 on it.
I ran a lot of the late 2.1.x kernels on this system and never had any
trouble (well, except for known things).
I didn't get the bit flipping others are talking about - I got total FS
corruption, with "attempt to read past end of device" and readdir
errors.  Unless maybe that was caused by bit flipping in the FS
structure.
I wondered if maybe the changes in the aic7xxx driver (I have an Adaptec
2940) related to tagged queueing being enabled by default might be
causing problems, but I think that only happened in 2.2.10, so that
wouldn't be it either.
I've had 2.2.6 running on my news server without a lick of trouble for a
couple of months now.  I'm afraid that right now I can't afford to
experiment very much - I don't have filesystems that I can trash at
will.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
