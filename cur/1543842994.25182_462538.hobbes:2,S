Please tell me if the next one is linewrapped too.

My fault. My firsts tests were on a Vector Linux, and, I don't know
why (bad cfg I guess), but udev didn't create the nodes automatically.
Now, in Debian, it does. I have noticed that and the last patch
doesn't have such lines. Sorry.

Ups, it is just an example for a user-space program that wants to use
the cfag12864b. I will remove the License line anyway.

The same as the kernel, I think. Is that right?

It isn't anymore. In the patch it is also removed and all the printks
improved, as Alexey Dobriyan told me also to do.

I thought the same, but LCD is already used by the "PDA Frontal LCD
Panel". They got the "linux/lcd.h" and "drivers/lcd/*", as well as a
fixed major number.
So I thought "bigger" and, IMHO a new folder for this kind of
misc-secondary-display devices (LCD or not) will be fine.
I think (maybe I'm wrong but...), we can just put the drivers right
there. There are a lot of this kind of hardware, but it will take time
to code more drivers. So if the resulting drivers are so different or
the drivers/* get a major update, relocate them. If not, leave them
until we have enough samples to start classifying.
