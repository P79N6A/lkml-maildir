Hi All,
Just a quick question:
As I know, swsusp is for hybernation (S4), right? The memory content will be written to the swap partition. What happens if the swap space is already used from programs? Abort? Or do I have to reserve swap space which never has to be used from programs?
Thank you!
Marc
