If I got the discussion so far correctly then the PCI-SGI spec does not
guarantee that there is no posting, but you know that the chipset
you are using right now doesn't do it. 
The problem with the explanation is that there will be very soon
chipsets not from Intel that also implement PCI-Express. And also
even systems with non Intel CPUs that also do PCI-Express and
mmconfig.
Did you check with other chipset vendors like Nvidia or VIA too? 
I would like us to not fall into the "all world runs a Intel chipset"
trap.
