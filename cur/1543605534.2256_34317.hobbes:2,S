I would certainly expect so.  I have a Gigabyte GA-7DX with the infamous VIA
686B southbridge...and an SBLive! Value...and I have no IDE devices at all
(complete SCSI).  I have never encountered data corruption.
Just out of curiosity...is this IBM drive a 75GXP model?  What does IBM's
Drive Fitness Test tell you about it?  I ask because the 75GXP is IMHO a
flawed product line.
