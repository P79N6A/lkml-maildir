Same as atomic_read on x86.

Same as atomic_t.
AFAIK, Linux requires aligned loads and stores to int and long (and pointer)
to be atomic.
Pretty much everywhere that uses RCU for example does so using atomic pointer
loads and stores. The nastiest issue IMO actually is reloading the value
through the pointer even if it isn't explicitly dereferenced. RCU gets this
right with ACCESS_ONCE. Probably a lot of code using basic types does not.
x86 atomic_read maybe should be using ACCESS_ONCE too...
