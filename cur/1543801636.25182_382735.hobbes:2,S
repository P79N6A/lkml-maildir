Hmmm it would be terrible. Just thinking about what a conversation
would look like :
  "Hi guys, I found a bug in xxx subsystem, basically it did blablabla
   to my box when I tried to blablabla. I fixed it the dirty way, please
   consult the patch list and look for subject XXX.
   => reply :
   Hi foo,
   there was an cleaner fix, yours is buggy because blablabla. please
   use my reply to your mail on the patch list instead.
  "
Most people here *comment* patches :
  - methods
  - bugs
  - typos
  - coding style
There's no way to do this on two separate lists. It's already very
annoying when someone posts an HTTP link to some content outside !
