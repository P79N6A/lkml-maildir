No, pci_read_bridge_bases() is obsoleted by new pci setup code. ;-)
You have to set up bus resources properly in pcibios_fixup_bus().
For a single root bus configuration, you don't need to do anything
with the root bus itself - its resources already point to ioport_resource
and iomem_resource, which should be ok. For pci-pci bridges you have
to add something like this:
	struct pci_dev *bridge = bus->self;
	if (bridge) {
		int i;
		for(i=0; i<3; i++) {
			bus->resource[i] =
				&bridge->resource[PCI_BRIDGE_RESOURCES+i];
			bus->resource[i]->name = bus->name;
		}
		bus->resource[0]->flags = pci_bridge_check_io(bridge);
		bus->resource[1]->flags = IORESOURCE_MEM;
		bus->resource[0]->end = ioport_resource.end;
		bus->resource[1]->end = iomem_resource.end;
		/* Turn off downstream PF memory address range by default */
		bus->resource[2]->start = 1024*1024;
		bus->resource[2]->end = bus->resource[2]->start - 1;
	}
Check arch/alpha/kernel/pci.c:pcibios_fixup_bus() for reference.
