IIRC 8-bit sound, ISA. GUS on DOS used to emulate it

Never heard but ac97 suggests it's not that old

Kahlua is a liquor in Mexico named after some ancient (Mayan or Aztec)
deity :-)

Turtle Beach, I think it's newer than (at least the original) GUS.
> SOUND_PAS
Pro Audio Spectrum. Earlier than GUS? 8-bit I think

The original one (8-bit)? Not sure about relation to Kahlua and PAS

Look strange.
Don't you all think a large part (if not most) of the "ALSA-unsupported"
cards is no longed in any (Linux-related) use? I wouldn't be surprised
if they just don't exist anymore. Who is to write drivers for them and -
more importantly - who can test them?
The oldest card I currently have is (the original) GUS, it has 16-bit
DACs (and 8-bit ADC) and it's long dead (never bothered to fix it but
I think it could be easy). And I see it would be supported.
My oldest working (or at least installed) card is SB64 ISA, and it's
supported too. Yes, I have few junk-grade machines here.
