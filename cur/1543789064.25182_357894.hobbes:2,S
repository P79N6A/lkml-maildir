  Hi all,
  I have a ramdrive set up at boot time. The script is very simple, sets 
up the filesystem and mounts the ramdrive. The interesting part is that 
at first it doesn't work, but run a second time it is fine.
At first the mkfs part is ok, but mount reports no fs.
The second time, mkfs part is ok again and mount works as well.
I sent to syslog the output of the first run:

2.6.13.4 is running.

Any ideas about the hysteresis? :)
