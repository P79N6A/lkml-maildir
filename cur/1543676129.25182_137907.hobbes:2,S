It's hard. The shell might be printing and you cannot prevent that.
That said, the main problem was somebody could be stuck in waiting for
tty *forever* and thus everyone who tries to write also hangs.
This particular patch is in 2.4.20 already. There is another patch in
2.4.20 (?) which seems to fix the "main problem" (the n_tty_write_wakeup
function in n_tty.c), but I didn't verify it.
