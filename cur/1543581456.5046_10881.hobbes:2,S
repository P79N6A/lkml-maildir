Excuse my ignorance, but in file include/linux/fs.h, 2.4.x source
in the struct buffer_head, there is a member:
	unsigned short b_size;          /* block size */    
later there is a member:
	char * b_data;                  /* pointer to data block (512 byte) */ 
Is the "(512 byte)" part of the comment in error or do I misunderstand
the nature of 'b_size'
