David Ford is the typical challange responce user:
He writes emails, e.g. to me, but does not whitelist
me. I was fooled, answered his email, and now his
software wants me to confirm myself.
<insert some very unfriendly words here/>
I should experiment with newsreaders to read mail,
that way I could plonk him.
