The last time around for this question, I was half-paying attention, and
the rationale sounded like "We had an input device framework, no output
device framework, and too many bad shrooms to do something comprehensible".
(This is such a *frequent* FAQ, even all the time since 2.6.0 escaped, that
maybe we need to add a 3-4 line explain to the Kconfig 'help' stanza for
CONFIG_INPUT_PCSPKR - although for some reason, INPUT_SPARCSPKR and
INPUT_M68K_BEEP don't seem to cause the same questions....)
