Why do we even need a fbdev layer then!!! We might as well remove it 
completly!!!!
Its totally destroy's my dream of a real multidesktop OS :-( This is why 
I'm so upset. Using userland libraries to do multidesktop OS is a really 
limited retarded way of doing it. I worked on this for 3 years. Testing 
different systems with different configurations. Now I realize it will die 
a painful death.
