Giving apps more information about memory usage would certainly help.
If Squid could just be told "use 50% of the free memory as a cache" it
would make life a lot simpler :-)
Ideally, you would get a trappable signal which says "We're getting
short on memory, can you cut down your usage?" Then your well-behaved
app would trim itself a bit, solving the problem without killing
anything.
