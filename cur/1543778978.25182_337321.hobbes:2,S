 Hmm, that's what's in the GCC info pages for the relevant functions 
(I've omitted the "l" and "ll" variants):
"-- Built-in Function: int __builtin_ffs (unsigned int x)
     Returns one plus the index of the least significant 1-bit of X, or
     if X is zero, returns zero.
 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_clz (unsigned int x)
     Returns the number of leading 0-bits in X, starting at the most
     significant bit position.  If X is 0, the result is undefined.
 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_ctz (unsigned int x)
     Returns the number of trailing 0-bits in X, starting at the least
     significant bit position.  If X is 0, the result is undefined."
If that's not enough, then what would be?  I'm serious -- if you find it 
inadequate, then perhaps it could be improved.

 GCC should know the semantics of underlying CPU instructions used and be 
able to optimize expressions for common cases, e.g. like:
	return x == 0 ? 32 : __builtin_ctz(x);
when the CPU provides a "ctz" operation that returns 32 for 0.

 It depends on how many submodel-specific variants of inline assembly you 
need, how many reloads are required for constraints, possibly defeating 
the gain, etc.
 In this particular case "bsf" and "bsr" are notoriously slow for some 
i386 submodels, so using the generic O(log n) algorithm may result in 
better performance for them.  E.g. the execution time for "bsf" for the 
original i386 is 11 + 3n clock ticks (n refers to the resulting bit 
index), "bsr" for the i486 is 7 - 104 ticks (so again 3n), for Pentium -- 
7 - 72 ticks (2n, then).  It does not immediately mean they are worse, but 
they are slow enough for the pessimistic case checking alternatives is not 
unreasonable.
