Actually, I'm programming out in user space.  I was looking at the atomic.h
stuff to see how much would be usable.  But I have to look at reading
and writing pointers atomically also since that is heavily used in  
lock-free
programming, e.g. RCU for preemptive user threads which I have a couple of
implementations for.  I remember a discussion a while back about dependent
load memory ordering (alpha doesn't have it) for RCU but I don't recall any
discussion of the requirement for gcc to do atomic loads and stores.  I  
guess
it's just assumed.
It would be nice to have macros tied to the linux ones, ie. check the  
current
linux versions when porting them.  But I can always use asm if I have to.   
I'll
probably have to modify the conditions of use to say "no warranty is  
implied
and we really do mean it" and add a compiler flag to select between the  
safe asm
version and the "Do you feel lucky?" C macro version.
