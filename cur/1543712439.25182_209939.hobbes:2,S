Not sure.  Things like "low latency" and "high throughput" may need other
things, such as "seek latency" and "bandwidth" as _inputs_, not as outputs.
Such device parameters should have reasonable defaults, and use a userspace
app which runs a quick seek latency and bandwidth test at mount-time,
poking the results into sysfs.
