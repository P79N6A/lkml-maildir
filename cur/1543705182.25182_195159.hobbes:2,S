I disagree on the "bug" part. I will check with the compiler guys, but 
as long as gcc doesn't rely on 16 byte alignment I will rather just disable it 
in the compiler.
I don't see much sense in enforcing this just because of some obscure SSE2
function that can align itself. Saving instructions and stack space
would be more important.
