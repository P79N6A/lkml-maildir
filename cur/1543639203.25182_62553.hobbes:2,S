There is a convention amongst NFS clients that each client will always
flush *all* changes to the server upon close(), and it will always
check the file attributes upon a call to open() (and if the mtime or
file size have changed, one flushes the page cache).
This suffices to guarantee file cache consistency *provided* that only
one client opens the file at any given time.
If locking is used, all changes are flushed to the server upon
taking/releasing a lock, and the page cache is guaranteed to get
flushed upon taking a lock.
Cheers,
