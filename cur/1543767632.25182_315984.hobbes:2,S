Some time ago, I thought they decided to make zImage = bzImage.  That was
going through my mind when I tried "make zImage" and was actually surprised
it didn't work.
So I guess for some arches (x86 in this case) they could either make zImage
= bzImage or just remove it.  Although I'm not sure how many people actually
try it anymore =)
