On the contrary, on important 24x7 systems you don't want to have to
arrange for downtime just to update firmware/microcode. S/390 already
supports this (running Linux under VM and maybe running it in an LPAR
or raw, but I'm not sure) under the name "Concurrent Maintenance of
LIC" (LIC being Licensed Internal Code, the equivalent of microcode or
firmware). This includes processors. As other architectures begin to
play in the five-nines arena, we don't want Linux being left behind on
those architectures just because of some "oh, you can always recompile
the kernel or reboot" mentality.
