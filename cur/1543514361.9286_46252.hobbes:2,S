	I sent a patch to Ingo Molnar who adjusted it a bit and posted
it to linux-kernel last week and sent it to Linus.  It appears to have
been applied in 2.3.24.  All you should need to do is comment out that
section of init/main.c that was causing the problems (the part that
has the FIXME note).  I have not finished getting 2.3.24 to build
yet, but I was able to boot 2.3.23 this way with a ramdisk.
