This statement is a little misleading, the clustering software is other
stuff from SGI, they just have xfs filesystems on the machines. Now CXFS
is another story, but it only exists for Irix now and it is almost certainly
not going to be open source when it is available for Linux (and yes I know
that makes packaging and support really interesting).
