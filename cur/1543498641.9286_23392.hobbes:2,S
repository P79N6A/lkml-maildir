This is i586/UP; linux-2.3.6, compiled with egcs-19990608
(-fno-strict-aliasing instead of -fno-strength-reduce), binutils-2.9.4.0.1,
glibc-2.1.1. emacs (linked dynamically) to write this. No trouble at all.
I'd suspect your configuration is somehow broken (Used xconfig, perhaps? Or
didn't do "make oldconfig"?), or you are using broken compiler flags (with
gcc-2.95 snapshots the -fno-strict-aliasing is _mandatory_)
