This has been an interesting thread.  A few observations:
-the hdparm utility source dist includes a utility to activate the
Special Hardware in an ? laptop.  So there's the electrical
end taken care of.  The success of it the rest of the way
is made possible by (Linux) OS IDE hotswap support.
Having the OS part working well is a prerequisite for other
hardware/vendor specific magic utilities.  My compaq
laptop docs with a base station, which has the electrical
stuff for hot dock.  I sure wish I could use the IDE in the
base station under Linux after I dock...
-some very cheap IDE swap bays have a mechanical interlock
with the power switch.  Your turn the key, and the drive shuts
off, before you can pull it out.  power sequencing solved? don't
know about ATA133 on something this cheap though. Stll,
*very* useful for cloning drives, backup, sysadmin type stuff.
Just don't forget to tristate before you power off.  The expensive
stuff lets the OS control those two steps.  Kind of like the
difference between Mac/Sparc floppy power eject and PC
manual eject.  I'll still use the manual method, and save myself
hours doing workstation backup and cloning; as long as it exists :)
-PCMCIA has electrical hot swap support...?
Lots of reasons to support it, with a warning.
