You just don't get it. This is policy.

How dare somebody decide that a BSD license that
makes source-code available, but doesn't give its
control to Stallman, somehow taints the kernel.
Wake up! This is policy and bad policy, too.
If it wasn't for UC Berkeley, there wouldn't even
be a Linux, it was deliberately designed to be
compatible so the Berkeley (read UNIX) utilities
would run. This was well before GNU did anything
but a 'C' compiler and eimacs.
BTW us.ibm.com has an interesting policy, the
name in the DNS expires in a few minutes and only
becomes available for a few minutes each day. That
means that anything sent to Josh Boyer <jdub@us.ibm.com>,
in the c.c. list, above, gets cached here until the
name resolves.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
