I'm  not  sure  how  representative  for  the  "embedded  development
community at large" your statement is.
Just to add a data point to the statistice, I do agree with Rob's
opinion about needing Per to build the Linux kernel.
All other arguments aside, natively compiling the Linux kernel  on  a
target  board, especially with root file system mounted over NFS, has
always been an excellent stress test (you may even call it regression
test) for Linux running on some target hardware.
Losing this ability just because  some  scripts  are  implemented  in
language  FOO when plain shell will do as well is something we should
try to avoid.
Of course, YMMV.
Best regards,
Wolfgang Denk
