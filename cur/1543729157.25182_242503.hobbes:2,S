Usage:

I will push this if you are OK with it.

Agree. Discussed a long time ago if we should introduce
preprocessed _defconfig files, but people told me

IIRC it is possible just to add to a .config file, and then the last
assignment will decide.
But I have not tested it since long time ago so I may be wrong.
