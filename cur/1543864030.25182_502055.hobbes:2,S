Again, there IS a reason:  O_DIRECT eliminates the cpu overhead of the 
kernel-user copy, and when coupled with multithreading or aio, allows 
the IO queues to be kept full with useful transfers at all times. 
Normal read/write requires the kernel to buffer and guess access 
patterns correctly to perform read ahead and write behind perfectly to 
keep the queues full.  In practice, this does not happen perfectly all 
of the time, or even most of the time, so it slows things down.
