OK. But any variable is not set to EIOCBRETRY  in 2.6.14, 2.6.19,
2.6.20.
Is it correct?

We'd want retries to act only on the remaining bytes which haven't been
transferred as yet, so even in the EIOCBRETRY case the right thing to do
is to return the number of bytes that were successfully read without
blocking. The high level AIO code (see aio_rw_vect_rety) has the ability
to handle this.
So this is still correct.
Is there a real bug that you are seeing here ?
