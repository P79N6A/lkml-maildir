Detection at compile time is not reliable. Just last week, on a
plain x86 box with a good gcc, I was compiling with a compiler
called "/usr/local/bin/powerpc-linux-gcc". Guess what that does.
My compiler was not in the RPM database. My compiler could not
produce executables that would run on the build system, so build-time
tests wouldn't work. Compiler version information is fairly useless,
since x86-specific bugs don't matter at all. Maybe I even patched
my compiler.
Complaints about the local compiler are useful, but not sufficient.
They only protect the menuconfig program, the mkdep program...
As above, actual bug tests are better than trying to interpret
what the compiler reports for a version.
