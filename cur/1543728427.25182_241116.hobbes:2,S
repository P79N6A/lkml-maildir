For x86 at least, this can be entirely decoded in userspace using
the /dev/cpu/x/cpuid interface. See x86info for example of this.

ditto.
As these require arch specific parsers anyway, I don't think it makes
too much sense making a kernel abstraction trying to make them all
look 'the same', and if it can be done in userspace, why bother ?
The only other concern I have is the further expansion of sysfs with
no particular gain over what we currently have. The sysfs variant
*will* use more unreclaimable RAM than the proc version.
/proc/cpuinfo has done well enough for us for quite a number of years
now, what makes it so urgent to kill it now that sysfs is the
virtual-fs-de-jour ?
