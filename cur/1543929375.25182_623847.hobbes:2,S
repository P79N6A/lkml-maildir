It's very very hard to generate good C code because of the numerous ways
objects get temporarily created, and the week aliasing rules (as with C).
There are reasons that Fortran lives on (and no I'm not suggesting one
should rewrite the kernel in Fortran ;)) and the fact its not really got
pointer aliasing or "address of" operators and all the resulting
optimsation problems is one of the big ones.
