"Benefits all around?"  Such a machine would be slower and more
expensive than four single processor boxes, so what's the point?
This is fundamentally the problem with these kinds of schemes -- they
get outcompeted on price and availability by the massmarket items.
This is part of the very attraction of Linux -- it's running Unix on
stock, cheap, hardware.
