Linus,
They are correctly checking for PGE bits in the feature flags.  Some 486
processors and all Pentium and above support 4MB Page Extensions and IO
breakpoints.  If a processor has these bits set, it's a safe assumption
that a CR4 register is present to enable debugging extensions (since
this is how they are enabled).  I did not see a check for CMPXCHG8,
WriteCombining, or IO breakpoints in this code section to determine is a
CR4 register is present.
The "textbook" method from Intel is attached in a code snippet from
MANOS (which I copied verbatim from an Intel manual for detecting CR4.
:-)
