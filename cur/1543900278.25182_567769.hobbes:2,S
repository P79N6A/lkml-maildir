 Indeed.  I am surprised they have decided to drop the poll command -- it 
surely does not require much logic as it mostly reuses what's used to 
produce the vector anyway and it is commonly used when 8259A 
implementations are interfaced to non-i386 processors.  PPC is another 
example.

 Strictly speaking it would not be a register, but a "PCI INTA address 
space" much like PCI memory or I/O port address spaces.  Though as the 
former ignores addresses driven on the bus, the space occupied does not 
have to be extensive -- I would assume whatever slot size is available 
with the address decoder you have implemented would do.

 You may have to modify other functions from arch/mips/kernel/i8259.c; 
yes, this makes the whole experience not as pretty as one would hope...
