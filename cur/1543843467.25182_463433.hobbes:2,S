I am not really sure, but I think the bind to an adapter under linux only 
chooses the source ip, not really the adapter used to send the packets.
Did you check that the two destination ips have routes through different 
interfaces, and not go out through the same one?
(You should even be able to verify this with tcpdump, if you get packets 
on one interface and nothing on the second)
