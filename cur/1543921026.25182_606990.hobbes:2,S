Too bad, since ^ is a valid character in a *file*name. Everything is, with
the exception of '\0' and '/'. At the end of the day, there are no control
characters you could use.
But what you could do is: write a FUSE fs that mirrors the lower content
(lofs/fuseloop/however it was named) and expands .zip files as
directories are readdir'ed or the zip files stat'ed. That saves us
from cluttering up the Linux VFS with such stuff.
