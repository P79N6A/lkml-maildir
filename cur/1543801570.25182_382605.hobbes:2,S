Nothing is wrong with that.
"brainstorming" was the most dominant word in the whole text. ;)
I just personally liked the idea of having a device node in /dev for
every existing hardware wlan card. Like we have device nodes for
other real hardware, too. It felt like a bit of a "unix way" to do
this to me. I don't say this is the way to go.
If a netlink socket is used (which is possible, for sure), we stay with
the old way of having no device node in /dev for networking devices.
That is ok. But that is really only an implementation detail (and for sure
a matter of taste).
The _real_ main point I wanted to make was to _not_ use a net_device for
the master device. What else should be used for master device, let it
be a device node or a netlink socket, is rather unimportant at
this stage.
