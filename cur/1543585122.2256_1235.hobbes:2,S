Thank you for your answers, Mike and Russell.
They made me sure something weird going on with my setup.
And I think a have figured the problem.
I was using etherboot to boot the kernel and initrd.
I should have told you that before, and I'm sorry I did not.
Bootin' localy, with lilo,  seems to  solve the "PID problem".
I guess that's more of mknbi from etherboot question than kernel-related...
I  have to check more in depth the etherboot documenation/sources.
Art.
