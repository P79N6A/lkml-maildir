Most interesting - here's the results from tcpdump

Looks like it's trying to access sunrpc services but I do not run sunrpc
on my machine AT all. Must be something I've cocked up with the machine's
configuration. I've checked inetd.conf and all sunrpc services are
disabled, quite properly.
Cheers,
