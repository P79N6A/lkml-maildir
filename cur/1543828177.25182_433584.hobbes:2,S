It looks like at least Serverworks HT1000 has trouble with MSI
too, but it's PCI-Express. But I guess those can be black listed
Also I think Intel has supported it well for a long time so might
want to white list all from VENDOR == Intel.
Blacklisting all old non PCI-E bridges non Intel seems reasonable
It seems AMD 8132 can be made to work, but it needs a special
quirk too and then it can be white listed.
The rules will be relatively complicated I guess, but should
be doable.
