Sure, but the Fortuna is supposed to be "more secure" because it
resists the state extension attack.  I don't think the state extension
attack is at all realistic, for the reasons cited above.  But if your
implementation doesn't resist the state extension attack, then why
bloat the kernel with an alternate random algorithm that's no better
as far as security is concerned?  (And is more heavy weight, and is
more wasteful with its entropy, etc., etc.?)

P.S.  I'll also note by the way, that in more recent versions of
/dev/random, we use a separate pool for /dev/urandom and /dev/random.
A further enhancement which I'm thinking might be a good one to add is
to limit the rate at which we transfer randomness from the primary
pool to the urandom pool.  So that it's not that I'm against making
changes; it's just that I want the changes to make sense, and protect
against realistic threats, not imaginary ones.
