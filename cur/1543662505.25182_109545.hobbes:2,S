Subject: [PATCH][2.5][0/14] *NEW* smp_call_function_on_cpu with Less Breakage (TM) Technology!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is yet another resend of my somewhat stale smp_call_function_on_cpu
patches with suggestions taken from Matthew Wilcox and James Bottomley to
recode smp_call_function as an smp_call_function_on_cpu user. The main 
reason for the resend this time is that i haven't changed the number of 
parameters to smp_call_function and hence _not_ breaking anything.
The purpose of smp_call_function_on_cpu is to invoke a function call on an 
arbitrary remote cpu or group of cpus utilising Interprocessor Interrupts. 
At present Alpha has a version (which i based this on) and IA64 has one 
called smp_call_function_single. This just makes it a general kernel 
function and part of the SMP API.
The i386 version has been tested on 8way P3-700 (courtesy of OSDL)
PS: Andrew, no the email address change isn't a killfile/procmail evasion 
tactic ;)
Linus please consider...
