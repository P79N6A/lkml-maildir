From Documentation/Changes of 2.2.4:
Sysklogd
========
   Older versions of sysklogd sometimes segfault under 2.2 kernels.
Upgrading to the latest release fixes that problem as well as adding
support for new features like system power-off on halt (with
appropriate incantations of halt; see the man page) and automatic
decoding of kernel oopses.
This is not correct, sysklogd package has nothing to do with powering off
the computer. It's the task of init and should be corrected.
If somebody would say what is the minimum version of SysVinit that
supports poweroff for 2.2 kernels I would produce a patch but cuurently I
don't know that.
