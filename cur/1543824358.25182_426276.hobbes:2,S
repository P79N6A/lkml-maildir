If one has syslogd which does not rotate logs, [s]he gets what [s]he deserves.
There are two desirable properties of logs:
 (a) do not lose information (i.e. save entire log)
 (b) do not overflow log storage
and they are simply incompatible. You must pick one.
I took (b) and am a very happy user of daemontools' multilog ever since.
I never need to manually manage my logs again...
