Drat!!!!!!!!!! The other WDC rule........
Fastest drive must be master..........do not ask why.
Both of these will report ATA-66.
Cavier drives with the "R" are fakes!!!!!
ATA-66 compatable, not ATA-66 Compliant.........
*************
Side note Fujitsu MPDxxxx drives are in the same class as WDC "R" drives.
MPC -->> ATA-33
MPD -->> ATA-33, but fakes ATA-66.........
MPE -->> ATA-66
*************
If you reverse the drives, I expect the missed interrupt goes away.
If it does not let me know.
Also you have not enable PIIX tuning.
This will force the drives to their correct limits with respect to the
host adapter.

This would help, but Memorex CDRW-2216 has an IRQ issues :-(
