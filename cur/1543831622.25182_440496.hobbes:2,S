i think you misunderstood what nested locking means in the lockdep case. 
(and that is my fault, for not adding enough documentation to 
down_write_nested() and down_read_nested().)
nested locking does not mean the same instance is allowed to nest! It 
only allows different-instance nesting, 'nesting within the same lock 
class'. (Lockdep has a very broad notion of 'lock class', to achieve the 
collection of very generic locking rules and to do as generic validation 
as possible. See Documentation/lockdep-design.txt for more details.)
Rw-locks on the other hand have special permission to nest for the same 
instance too. See commit 6c9076ec9cd448f43bbda871352a7067f456ee26:
    lockdep so far only allowed read-recursion for the same lock instance.
    This is enough in the overwhelming majority of cases, but a hostap case
    triggered and reported by Miles Lane relies on same-class
    different-instance recursion.  So we relax the restriction on read-lock
    recursion.
    (This change does not allow rwsem read-recursion, which is still
    forbidden.)
also please see the testcases in lib/locking-selftest.c, we specifically 
test the rwsem scenario you outlined above, to make sure the validator 
immediately flags it:

           recursive read-lock #2:             |  ok  |             |  ok  |
