This is a good idea, but I have two issues:
1) A major reason for having msecs_to_jiffies() and co. is to avoid
having to do this type of conversion ourselves. A weak argument,
admittedly, but just something to keep in mind.
2) This still has a serious logical flaw: If I request 1 second of
sleep, and I don't sleep the entire time, then it is now guaranteed that
I will think I did not sleep at all (ie. ssleep_interruptible() will
return 1). That's just another version of the original issue.
I just don't think it's useful to have this coarse of granularity, at
least in terms of interruptible sleep.
