It may not be a bios problem. mask = (info->irq[pin].bitmap &
pcibios_irq_mask). So an IRQ might not match the mask because the user
specified a more restrictive mask than the $PIR table.
I suppose we could use a second variable (pir_mask?) that didn't get &'d
with pcibios_irq_mask to do the checks.
Ideas, anyone?

Not yet. Wanted to do a bit more testing, especially considering the
pcmcia problems people have had. Do your pcmcia difficulties occur
without the patch, as well?
I'll test my 16-bit pcmcia modem/nic with my pcmcia scsi adapter, and
see if I get the same breakage.
Has anyone tried dual cardbus cards?
