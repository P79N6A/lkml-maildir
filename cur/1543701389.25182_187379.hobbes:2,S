Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 012 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've released the 012 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-012.tar.gz
rpms built against Red Hat FC1 are available at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-012-1.i386.rpm
with the source rpm at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-012-1.src.rpm
udev allows users to have a dynamic /dev and provides the ability to
have persistent device names.  It uses sysfs and /sbin/hotplug and runs
entirely in userspace.  It requires a 2.6 kernel with CONFIG_HOTPLUG
enabled to run.  Please see the udev FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
For any udev vs devfs questions anyone might have, please see:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev_vs_devfs
The major changes since the 011 release are:
	- updated ide devfs compatible script
	- command line options are now available, allowing you to query
	  the udev database.  This is just a first cut, the query
	  functionality will be extended later.
	- lots of minor bug fixes and tweaks.
Thanks again to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a
full list of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of this tree used to be found at:
	
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/bitkeeper/udev/
But that box seems to be down now.  Hopefully it will be restored
someday.  If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just
email me.
thanks,
greg k-h
