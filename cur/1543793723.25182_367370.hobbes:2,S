Yes, but 1024 pages in one block is one bit per page. Usemap uses 1 page
for all 1024.

That's what I thought when I wrote it first but it broke down fast
according to bench-stresshighalloc. I'll need to re-examine the patches
and see where I went wrong.

That's iterating through, potentially, 1024 pages which I considered too
expensive. In terms of code complexity, the page-flags patch adds 237
which is not much of a saving in comparison to 275 that the usemap
approach uses.
Again, I can revisit the page-flag approach if I thought that something
like this would get merged and people would not choke on another page flag
being consumed.
