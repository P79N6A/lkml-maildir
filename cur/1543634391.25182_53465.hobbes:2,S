This is actually yet another "32-bit virtualspace sucks" issue. You can't
get at all your RAM from userspace because the virtualspace set aside for
the kernel prevents you from using it to map physical memory. 64-bit
virtualspace is too vast to be easily exhausted this way.
The original form of highmem was "BIGMEM" which used (almost) disjoint
user and kernel virtual address spaces, but this is not terribly
efficient with respect to lazy TLB entry invalidation.
Cheers,
Bill
