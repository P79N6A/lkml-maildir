Hi all,
I am trying to compile a program using a MIPS-LINUX cross compiler(gcc). I've set up a connection between my i386 Linux machine and a MIPS(RM7000) processor. This is again connected to a WinNT Terminal where there should be an output from the MIPS processor.
I have 2 kernels in my Linux machine under the directories:
1) /usr/src/linux - kernel version 2.2.14
2) /root/kernels/linux - kernel version 2.4.14
I am using a boot image generated from the older kernel for booting. The problem is the older kernel doesn't support MIPS architecture. What should I do to upgrade my kernel so that it supports MIPS architecture & that I'll be able to cross-compile my programs properly.
Domcan
