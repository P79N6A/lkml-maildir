What will happen when a PATA disk lies behind a Marvel(ous) bridge, as
in most SATA disks today?
Is large transfers mandatory in the LBA48 spec and is LBA48 really
mandatory in SATA?
And yes, I saw that the dmesg showed a Maxtor drive, but I'm uncertain
if that disk of yours has a Marvel chip on or not, since newer Maxtors
might (have) come out (already) without a Marvel chip, I just don't
know.
