Well, your aggressive tone definitely doesn't encourage speedy answers.

iirc it was a patch that came in over Andrew. I can't find the email anymore
unfortunately. The argument looked plausible and I think it fixed
a boot problem for the submitter on some arch (probably IA64, on x86-64 it 
worked fine without it, but I've never tried sparsemem and the code was 
originally written before sparsemem). Andrew do you still have the patch with 
the description? It must have been between 2.6.13mm1 and  2.6.13mm2.
You're right that four zones should in theory fit into 2 bits, so I'm
also not sure why it was needed.
