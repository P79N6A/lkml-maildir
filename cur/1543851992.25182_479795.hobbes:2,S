OK.

Page freeing is not actually a fastpath.  It's rate-limited by the
frequency at which the CPU can _use_ the page: by filling it from disk, or
by writing to all of the page with the CPU.
Plus this is free_pages_bulk(), so the additional test occurs once per
per_cpu_pages.batch pages, not once per page.
And I assume it could be brought down to a single comparison with some
thought.

I think you missed the point.
At present the code does interleaving by taking one page from each zone and
then advancing onto the next zone, yes?
If so, this is pretty awful frmo a cache utilsiation POV.  it'd be much
better to take 16 pages from one zone before advancing onto the next one.

Umm, but that's exactly what the patch we're discussing will do.

yup.
