Not much to post - strange behaviour began, and thirty seconds
later the machine was totally dead, no reaction to keystrokes
any more.
Hope to find time one of these days to set up a serial console
and capture messages.
And to read the source.
And to hear from others. Maybe Jens once said that it was easy to fix
ide-scsi but that there was no interest. Possibly he has a more precise
idea what kind of things are broken. Or maybe you do.
