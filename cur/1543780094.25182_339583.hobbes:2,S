By netpoll_poll() tickling the driver enough to free the currently
queued outgoing SKBs.
Also note that by the time we're in this loop, we're ready to take
desperate measures. We've already exhausted our private queue of SKBs
so we have no alternative but to keep kicking the driver until
something happens.
The netpoll philosophy is to assume that its traffic is an absolute
priority - it is better to potentially hang trying to deliver a panic
message than to give up and crash silently.

That's fine. But in fact, it does show up occassionally - I've seen
it.
NAK'ed.
