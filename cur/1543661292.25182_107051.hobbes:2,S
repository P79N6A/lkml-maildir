Hi there, i have a little shutdown problem. I tried to find the answer 
on the internet,
irc channels and so on , but no one there knows. Someone in the mandrake 
irc channel at freenode.net advised me to turn to you.
I use mandrake dolphin 9.0 download version,
on an AMD k6 400 3d now, with dfi motherboard, and ami bios.
when i shutdown after the message
powerdown
i get an error:
EIP: 0050:[<00008865>] Not tainted

call Trace : [<c01148dd>] [<c0110000>]
Code: Bad EIP value
        Is there any direction where is should look for this error?
and how can i get around it?
I tried the <linux noapic> at boot but that did not solve this error.
When i turn off the power after this error and then power up the pc and 
boot agian
everythings works as normal. < but wen shutting down the error is there 
agian.>
Hopefully you can give me some information , so that i can solve this 
litttle problem.
With lots of greeting from the netherlands,
