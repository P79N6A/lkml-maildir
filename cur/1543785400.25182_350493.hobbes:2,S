What exactly does devfs do that udev doesn't, exactly?  I haven't  
been able to find anything on my wide variety of hardware, although I  
will admit that there are some drivers that do not yet fully/ 
correctly use the new driver model.

udev isn't that big or that slow, especially not the new netlink- 
socket version, so unless you can provide a concrete example, I'm not  
entirely sure what you're talking about.

What makes you think specifying nodes is incompatible with  
hotplugging?  I have my USB mouse and keyboard show up as /dev/ 
gyration_mouse and /dev/macally_keyboard, and I point my little input  
event program at those.  Admittedly, X kinda gets confused when I  
unplug and those go away, but X doesn't support hotplugging anyways.

So there are broken non-new-driver-model drivers.  If you depend on  
them (especially if you depend on them for your commercial product),  
please feel free to fix them, because otherwise they won't be, and  
they'll get more out of date with every kernel release until somebody  
deletes them because they're unmaintained.

See above.  Feel free to fix the driver if you need it.

Yes it does.  It works correctly for me.

So?  You need to change your /dev paths _now_.  You've known that  
those paths were kinda going away for a _long_ time, so it's not like  
you haven't had time to fix your code that used them.  And if you  
need a kernel-generated /dev, then ndevfs will work (albeit with sane  
paths, as opposed to the old devfs /dev/ide/host0/bus0/... crap).

devfs can't be maintained _within_ the kernel tree, let alone _out_  
of it.  Besides, it contained unfixable races, etc.

This sentence doesn't parse, perhaps you'd like to clarify?  In any  
case, devfs is going away because it's sufficiently racy and broken  
and has been marked as DEPRECATED for a year.  udev _has_ been  
completely working for a while, even if not for the full year.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
