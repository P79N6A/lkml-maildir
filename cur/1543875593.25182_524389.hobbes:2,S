Well, that seems to be a good suggestion.  We will try it out by
asking the reclaimer to do as much as possible in minimum time/effort.
 However we have to figure out how hard we want to push the reclaimer.
 In fact we can push the shrink_active_list() and
shrink_inactive_list() routines to reclaim the _all_ container pages.
 We do have reclaim priority to play with.  Let see if we can comeup
with some automatic method to reclaim 'good' number of pages each time.
