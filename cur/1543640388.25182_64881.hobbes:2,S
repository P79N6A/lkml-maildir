I've already told you about fops_get(). And for a block device, it's
def_blk_fops.open().

Well, I was going to say that once devfs_unregister() has been called,
you can't get reach devfs_open() for that entry, because the
corresponding dentry is unhashed, and devfs_lookup() won't reach the
entry either.
However, after thinking about it more closely, I note that if you have
already started devfs_open(), and then the module tries to unload,
there is a small window before the call to def_blk_fops.open()/fops_get()
where the ops pointer can become invalid. I've fixed that in my tree,
by using devfs_get_ops(), which safely handles this. I've also added
some comments, to make it clearer.
