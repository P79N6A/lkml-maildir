The kernel-doc syntax looks good to me.  I'm not so sure about
the presentation part, but I guess that Alexey is stil working
on that part.
I think that I'm agreeing with what Martin Waitz said, that the
implementation is good, but not so sure about the usefulness of it.
Alexey, do you see lots of nested structs (and/or unions) in
kernel APIs?  I haven't gone searching for them.  Have you?
OTOH, it's not costly, so if it works, it's fine.
