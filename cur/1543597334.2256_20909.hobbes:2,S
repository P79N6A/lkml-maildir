I'll agree with that.  The big thing we lack in 2.4 is filesystem
space reservation.  It's the companion of allocate on write, and with
a little care could handle a lot of the bad cases with sparse files.
If done right we don't need to care how a file is layed out on disk.
We reserve the whole 1G during swapon, or more likely we reserve
storage from the swap page when we allocate it.  But this garantees we
won't have space problems later on during the write.

Unifying the cases is good, but a lot of the over complex code is simply
because people just don't get around to updating the swap code to use
the new inferfaces when everything else is updated.  The code is just
patched to keep working when inerfaces are changed.

Hmm.  I'm not certain what you are going for here.  Having swap going
to an address_space object is only a couple of days work to get
going, and gives the benefits you are describing.  Basically the only
case left in the code would be the swap file case.
Removing anonymous shared copy on write pages is something that might
be worth doing but it is something we need to examine very closely.
Over simplying things in the case of swap is very dangerous.  Last
time we tried we would up cache tons of worthless dead swap pages.
