I tried stepping up from 2.6.5-rc3-mm4 to 2.6.5-mm4.
This Quokka seems too zonked to work though.
It came up, but I couldn't run "xterm".  Trying from
the xemacs shell I saw an error message about not enough ptys.
I use the devpts fs mounted on /dev/pts
It mounts just fine, but doesn't work apparently.  There are no
such problems with 2.6.5-rc3-mm4
