Add a large global variable to the .data segment (you need to initialize
it). If you want to tune the size of the kernel between 1.1 and 1.3m then
calc the size of your current image and add to it the delta.
main()
{
	static int foo[1024*1204] = { 1, };
}
the above proggy for example would generate a 4mbyte ELF executable.
You can add such a variable where you want (just choose your preferred .c 
source ;).
