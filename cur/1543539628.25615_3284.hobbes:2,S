*grin*  Actually, in those days, that was an out-right lie!  Spin down the
hard drive and then send it a seek command... most hard drives won't do that
anymore.  Or, run a full stroke seek test for an hour... (I've actually seen
a modern seagate IDE drive sling a pickup head off doing that once.)
The point is, you can never protect the hardware from itself.  Read another
way, there's no such thing as a "safe" nuclear weapon.  A gun without any
bullets isn't very useful now is it?
