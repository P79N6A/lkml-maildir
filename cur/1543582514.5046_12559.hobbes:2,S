Isn't this more or less the default already in 2.4?
If I read the code correctly, we set the dentry d_flag
DCACHE_NFSD_DISCONNECTED on such dummy dentries.  We only force a
lookup of the full path if the inode represents a directory or the
NFSEXP_NOSUBTREECHECK export flag is not set.
It doesn't seem like a major change to delay that full path lookup of
the dentry until nfsd_lookup('..') is actually called (in the case
where the 'subtree_check' flag isn't used).
However, outright banning lookups of '..' by any one filesystem isn't
an option: path lookups are used for a lot more than just
`getcwd'. Imagine for instance trying to follow a relative soft link
across such a filesystem.
Cheers,
