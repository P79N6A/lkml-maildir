I don't think it matters, because /share/$USER duplicates a part or
the whole of the user's namespace.
So backup would have to be taught about /share anyway, and deluser
operates on /home/$USER and not on /share/*, so there shouldn't be any
problem.
There's actually very little difference between rbind+chroot, and
CLONE_NEWNS.  In a private namespace:
  1) when no more processes reference the namespace, the tree will be
    disbanded
  2) the mount tree won't be accessible from outside the namespace
Wanting a persistent namespace contradicts 1).
Wanting a per-user (as opposed to per-session) namespace contradicts
2).  The namespace _has_ to be accessible from outside, so that a new
session can access/copy it.
So both requirements point to the rbind/chroot solution.
