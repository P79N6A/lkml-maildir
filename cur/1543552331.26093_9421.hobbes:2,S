This method above is taken from 
http://www.isd.cme.nist.gov/projects/emc/shmem.html,
 and it said the
buffer size should not bigger than pagesize, but I map almost 31M in a
machine, that's no problem, and the memory near 32M whenI write a random
number, then read out it, they are different, and the read is always
65535. So I think I can use almost 31M, or absolutely 30M. How do you
think about this? (BTW, the pagesize in my machine is 4M)
Best.
