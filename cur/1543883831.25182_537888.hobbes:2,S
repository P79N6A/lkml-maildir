This is a series of patches to improve i386 stack handling in several
manners. The net result is to improve system stability via IRQ stacks
while remaining memory efficient and to improve stack debugging.
[1/3] dynamically allocate irq stacks
	This conserves memory while using IRQ stacks.
[2/3] make irqstacks unconditional, while retaining 4/8k stack selection
	This makes IRQ stacks the standard for mainline.
[3/3] DEBUG_STACK option enabling vmalloc()'ed stacks and __pa checks
	Stack debugging option using vmalloc() to establish guard pages.
