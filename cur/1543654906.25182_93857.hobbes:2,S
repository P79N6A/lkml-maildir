FreeBSD splits #! magic strings on whitespace and passes multiple
arguments. Linux passes everything after the first whitespace as a
single argument but strips trailing whitespace. NetBSD does the same as
Linux but passes trailing whitespace as part of the argument.

Bash is (correctly) complaining that it's been passed an invalid
argument, but the reason for the different behaviour between it and
FreeBSD is because of binfmt_script. There's no clearly defined standard
for how this should behave.
