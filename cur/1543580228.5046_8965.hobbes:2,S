Subject: [UPDATE] Fresh zerocopy patch on kernel.org
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/1/30/48

At the usual place:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/zerocopy-2.4.1-1.diff.gz
(As usual, please allow some minutes for the mirrors to get it)
Changes since last installment:
1) Merge to 2.4.1 final. (me)
2) Accept TCP flags (ACK, URG, RST, etc.) for out of window packets
   if truncating the data to the window would make that packet valid.
   (Alexey)
3) Add SO_ACCEPTCONN, Unix standard wants it. (me)
Have fun testing...
Later,
David S. Miller
