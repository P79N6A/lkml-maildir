  Award v6.0 on the ASUS MB we have didn't seem to have a problem.
  I chopped the disk into two 15G partitions and stuffed the second one full
of files.  That took a few hours.  I had no problems and some spot
comparisons of files revealed no errors.  I'll have our intern use it to
encode CDs for the near future.  We'll see if anything weird happens.
