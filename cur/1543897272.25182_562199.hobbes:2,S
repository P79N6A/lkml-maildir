I may have misunderstood your make system. I cd-ed into the cdrtools
directory, ran ./Gmake.linux clean (I had already compiled with GCC),
and then ./Gmake.linux CCOM=suncc. I didn't see any errors at the end of
the make output.
However, what confused me was that the cdrecord binary wasn't removed.
And scrolling back, I see several compile errors from Sun's C compiler.
Shouldn't "make clean" remove the executable files?
