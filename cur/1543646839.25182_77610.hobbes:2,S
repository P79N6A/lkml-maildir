IMHO the problem istn't to make a patch, it's more a "policy" question:
The problem is that from the point of view of a _user_ it's quite
surprising to see the speaker support at the input devices - and if the
speaker doesn't work you wouldn't search for an option under "Input device
support". From a programmers point of view "Input device support" might be
the best place but it will produce much confusion among many users. Is it
perhaps possible to move the speaker support to "Character devices"?
TIA
