Could this be a problem with my chipset (Via)?  I'm on an Abit VP6
motherboard.  I'm actually suprised I haven't had problems with ide in
2.4.19 (the hpt controller and via).
Below is the usb stuff from lspci -v:
00:07.2 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB (rev 16) (prog-if 00
[UHCI])
	Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc. (Wrong ID) USB Controller
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 12
	I/O ports at d400 [size=32]
	Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 2
00:07.3 USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. USB (rev 16) (prog-if 00
[UHCI])
	Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc. (Wrong ID) USB Controller
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 12
	I/O ports at d800 [size=32]
	Capabilities: [80] Power Management version 2
