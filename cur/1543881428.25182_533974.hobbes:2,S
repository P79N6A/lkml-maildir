Our you could think outside the circle:
Store all your "small files" as symlinks, then use "symlink" to create
them and "readlink" to read them. (You would probably end up use
symlinkat and readlinkat).
Only one system call instead of three.
I guess you don't get meaningful permission bits then... I wonder if
that really matters.
