Hi
The NETLINK_ROUTE family deifned as a part of the netlink socket
protocol has the data handler of the sock structure set to
rtnetlinl_rcv. However this function dequeues the data packet ( in the
skb ) from the  receive queue of the sock structure and processes it if
the flag in the nlmsghdr is set ot NLM_F_REQUEST.
While sending information back to the user this flag is not set. So the
packet is dequeued and lost . Arnt there provisions made to handle
packets from the kernel to the user ?
Thanks in advance
Praveen
