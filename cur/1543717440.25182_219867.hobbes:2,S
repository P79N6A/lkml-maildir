hi, yea nice to get a reply from you, I looked through all the listed 
kernel bugs relating to api, and I found several submitted by you- I guess 
i shouldve guessed you were the maintainer.
> try booting with "nolapic"
This worked - now seeing as it worked, and I can't find any mention of it 
in the bootparam man page [and i havent dug through the source yet], what 
exactly did i do?

hehe no problem, I was under the impression that was the 'official' site 
for acpi, but i found that odd seeing as nothing on the site seemed newer 
than ~12 months, and i knew that ACPI had undergone some fixes/changes 
since then.
Anyways, thanks for the help. It's nice to have a bettery monitor now, 
although Im guessing my laptop doesnt support other extensions [i.e. 
current cpu temp in c is -------], but i suppose I can kind my answers 
about that stuff in the man pages/documentation. Anyways thanks for the 
help with the ACPI.
