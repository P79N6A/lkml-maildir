Easily done.  Because I don't really know how big we need to make the
stacks yet, I've put a non-accessible guard page just below the 
interrupt stack.  I can arrange for (SP & ~8192) to hit this page.

How do you tell GCC to stay away from that register when compiling
the kernel without also making it unusable in userland?
