Subject: [PATCH] [2.5.45] Extended /proc/partitions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

  Hello,
  this patch (against 2.5.45) extends contents of /proc/partitions by starting
offset of each partition. This can be terribly useful if you (or someone who
then passed you the computer for a repair) by some mistake over-dd'd the
partition table on a disk, but the system is still up. I know that you can also
dig this out by some ioctl()s, but this can make life a lot easier for those
who don't know C or can't dig the ioctl codes from the kernel source code.
  Note that it's possibly totally flawed (I don't know anything about this
piece of code), but it looks to work ok.
  Kind regards,
