I made sure, that I am booted 2.6.5, removed /usr/src/linux-2.6.5, 
and /lib/modules/2.6.5, unpacked the tarball by hand, in case the ebuild did 
some patching, made a symlink with ln -s linux-2.6.5 linux and cd'ed into 
linux.
There I copied agpgart-2004-04-06.diff into /usr/src/linux and applied it with 
patch -p1 < agpgart-2004-04-06.diff
It said, that it was applied against sis, intel, efficion and via (not this 
order..) and I found no *.rej files, while the supposed to be patched files 
had an actual timestamp.
After that I copied over my .config from 2.6.5-rc3, made make oldconfig, 
without any problems, and make all modules_install install after that.
Grub points to vmlinuz, so everything fine there.
I rebooted.
Same error, uname -r:
Linux energy.heim10.tu-clausthal.de 2.6.5 #1 Tue Apr 6 20:26:45 CEST 2004 i686 
AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2000+ AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux
So yes, I am pretty sure, that I am innocent ;o)
Glück Auf
