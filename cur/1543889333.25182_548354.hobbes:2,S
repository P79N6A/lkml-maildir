What's the proper way now to figure out which device type it is --
block or char?
Before, I had a function (in my udev-alike userspace app), something akin
sysfs_scan_devices(char *topdir, mode_t type), and called it twice --
  sysfs_scan_devices("/block", S_IFBLK);
  sysfs_scan_devices("/devices", S_IFCHR);
How it's supposed to work now?  (Note that it skips symlinks for obvious
reason, hence it can't find anything in /sys/block, even with the compat
"layer" in place)
(Not complaining, but asking instead)
Thanks.
