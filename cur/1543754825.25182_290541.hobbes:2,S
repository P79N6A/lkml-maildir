I just got an interesting "I see these problems too" report.  It
may provide a useful clue.  According to "Art Haas" <ahaas@airmail.net>:

I do have CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_MASQUERADE=y on the system where I'm
seeing this, though it's not doing anything just now.  Haven't yet
made time to see if disabling it improves things ... but if that's
a factor, it could explain why more people aren't suffering with
this problem.
