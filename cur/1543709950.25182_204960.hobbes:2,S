I will try, to see what happens. But please write an exploit for
truncate too since you obviously can, blaming on the vm is a
red-herring, if the vm has an issue, truncate always had an issue in any
kernel out there since 1997 (the first time I rememeber).
Unless it crashes the machine I don't care, it's totally wrong in my
opinion to hurt everything useful to save cpu while running an exploit.
there are easier ways to waste cpu (rewrite the exploit with truncate
please!!!)
