On Novell server. On server cmdline type
'set display watchdog logouts = on'. Though I'm not sure that this exist
on NW3.12...

You do not have. I'm just trying to help you with your problem. As it
does not happen here for me, it must be something specific to your site.
Also, as on IPX watchdogs are served by userspace ncpd, which
version of ncpfs do you use? Latest is 2.2.0.18. Some of previous
versions (2.2.0.17) commited suicide (exit(0) instead of return 0) 
when message was sent to your workstation, but you were not logged
in or you had all consoles 'mesg n', so watchdogs were not processed 
anymore after this... 2.2.0.16 and 2.2.0.18 should be safe, but
you can try yourself... do 'ps -ax | grep ncpd | wc -l'. Then
do 'nsend <yourself> "Hi"' and do 'ps -ax | grep ncpd | wc -l' again.
If number differs, your ncpfs should be updated...
                                        Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
