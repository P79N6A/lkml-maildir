I ran make clean and then make prepare but it gives an error saying
"no such file or directory : modpost ", ....
Then i ran make( in the kernel source tree) , and terminated it after
a few files were compiled and then again tried to compile my module,
this time it worked without any errors, ....... any particular reason
for this ??
Thanks
