No, it should be fine as is (unless perhaps some barrier is needed).
The check
	size = (i_size_read(inode) + PAGE_CACHE_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
	if (!page->mapping || page->index >= size)
		goto err_unlock;
handles the case that worries you: page->mapping will be NULL.
do_no_page has to do the more complicated truncate_count business because
it deals with all kinds of ->nopage, some of which leave page->mapping NULL:
so it's unable to distinguish one where the driver left it NULL from one
where truncation has suddenly made it NULL.
