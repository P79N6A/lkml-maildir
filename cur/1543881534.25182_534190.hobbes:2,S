Ingo,
This turns out to be only part of the story.  There are two scroll options for
the glitch1 script.  With 'jump' scrolling I get:
cfs v5 	jump	-19	500 FPS
cfs v5 	jump 	-10	500 FPS
cfs v5 	jump	-5	150 FPS
cfs v5 	jump	0	25 FPS
cfs v5	1 line	-19	230 FPS
cfs v5 	1 line 	-10	195 FPS
cfs v5	1 line 	-5	720 FPS
cfs v5	1 line 	0	970 FPS
cfs v5	1 line 	10	430 FPS
sd 0.46	1 line 	-19	0.5 FPS
sd 0.46	1 line 	-10	0.8 FPS
sd 0.46	1 line 	0	2.3 FPS
sd 0.46	1 line 	10	93 FPS
sd 0.46	1 line 	19	93 FPS
sd 0.46	jump is basically the same as the 1 line case.
glxgears alone gets about 1500 FPS
So in one case nice -10 gives us the worst performance.  In the other case,
where you predicted nice 19 would get the best numbers nice 0 does...  Nor
does the SD scheduler produce the results predicted.
Thanks,
Ed Tomlinson
