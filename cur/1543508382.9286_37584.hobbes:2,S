Not exactly. It does something _similar_ to poll and calls the
same per-descriptor check functions but saying it translates
to poll is going a bit far :-).

Er... The difference between select and poll is not that great
if you manage your fd space effectively. Also poll scales to
large numbers of fds worse than select. And poll will dirty
a lot more cache than the equivalent select - which is a problem
for real life which sooner than it is for benchmarking :-).
(Poll uses 8 bytes per fd, select uses 3 bits...)
