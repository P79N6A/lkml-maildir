Not sure, the theoretical max amount of memory one can 'lose' in socket
wait queues is well over the amount of physical memory we have in
machines today (even for SGI); this combined with the fact that we limit
the memory in some way to avoid DoS attacks, could make for all memory
to be stuck in wait queues. Of course this becomes rather more unlikely
for ever larger amounts of memory. But unlikely is never a guarantee.

Yes, however it is possible for kswapd and direct reclaim to block on
get_request_wait() for the nbd/iscsi request queue by sheer misfortune.
In that case there will be no more reclaim; of course the more active
processes we have the unlikelier this will be. Still with the sheer
amount of cpu time invested in Linux its not a gamble we're likely to
never lose.
