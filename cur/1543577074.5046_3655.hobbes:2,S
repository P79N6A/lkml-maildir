You can easily do reader-xchg semantics even if you don't have an atomic
xchg and are using spinlocks. In fact, it will work the obvious way
correctly, assuming that the reader either gets the old value or the new
value but not some "partway old and new".
A xchg() that uses spinlocks and a simple read+write inside the spinlock
will give that exact behaviour as long as the "load-and-zero" is not
used for the xchg _value_, but only used for the spinlock, which is the
obvious implementation.
So we're fine. The parisc implementation isn't the fastest in the world,
but hey, that's what you get for having bad hardware support for SMP.
