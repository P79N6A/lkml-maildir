Probably for no good reason.

I guess that dropping the BKL around the machine_restart() call would be an
appropriate 2.4 fix.
Where exactly does the rebooting CPU get stuck in machine_restart()?  If
someone has done lock_kernel() with local interrupts disabled then yes,
it'll deadlock.  But that's unlikely?  Confused.
