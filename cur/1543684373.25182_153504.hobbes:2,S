How about
	ln -s noext=1,speed=6 /proc/module/psmouse
to create it with options required on load.
Symlink is the only node creator that allows arbitrary
content.
Otherwise, to be consistent with one value/file, it seem
that instead of an options file you write to each option
should have its own file.  Options that can only be set
during load would be readonly files.
Drifting slightly off-topic for this.  Wouldn't it be less
costly to have the configuration options be extended
attributes of a file or directory instead of separate files
in a directory?  I've been wondering this for some time.
I wouldn't want dynamic values, such as counters, to be
extended attributes but values that never change could be.
Extended attributes provide a nice NAME=VALUE implicitly in
a consistent way without having to have all those inodes.
DISCLAIMER:
	i don't use modules myself so the options in my
	examples are unlikely to be valid.
