  We call XvShmPutImage and then do an XSync, which will wait until X
sends a message indicating it has processed all outstanding requests.
The XvShmPutImage uploads the image to video memory immediately, so the
call to XSync blocks us until it is complete.  We are not preempting the
X server.
  I will get accurate information about the priorities of all processes
involved here.
