Hi,
are there any plans to use (unsigned int) instead of (unsigned short) for
the cylinder numbers in the 2.2.x kernel series ?
The problem is using a > 32GB disk with the   'append="hdc=18170,64,63"'
startup command results only in a third of the original disk performance,
e.g. about 6 MB/s instead of 21 MB/s. The original performance was
measured by either jumbering the disk for 32GB (no append needed) or by
using a 2.3.x kernel (here the problems seems to be solved).
Regards,
  Edgar
