After looking at the Radeon driver I'm increasingly convinced that it's
causing your problems.
Please try disabling Xscreensaver and see if the xruns go away - looking
at radeonfb it seems like the xruns could be triggered by video mode
switching, there are lots of places where it loops waiting for the
hardware to be ready.  If that eliminates them I have a patch you can
try.
