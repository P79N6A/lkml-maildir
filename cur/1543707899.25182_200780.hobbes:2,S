What happened to the experiment of having slab pages on the (in)active
lists and letting them be free'd that way? Didn't somebody already do 
that? Ed Tomlinson and Craig Kulesa?
That's still something I'd like to try, although that's obviously 2.7.x 
material, so not useful for rigth now.
Or did the experiment just never work out well?
