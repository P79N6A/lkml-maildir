Err, debian/sid *isn't* defaulting to gcc-4.2 yet, but it is made
available to people who want to install it and play with it.
Additionally, the kernel build is actually tied to a specific compiler
(doesn't default to just using whatever the default compiler is) so even
when gcc-4.2 is eventually made the default compiler the linux images
built for Debian won't use it immediately.  That change will be made
seperately and after additional testing to make sure it doesn't break
the built kernel which is distributed.
