Nope. Capabilities mean SFA to root ATM: root can just bypass them all.
Not a very useful `feature', but hard to remove I suspect.

Root can bypass every piece of sanity and security checking in the kernel
ATM. This isn't a feature, it's a bug, but there's not much that can be
done about it ATM. In the meantime, we should just make sure the checking
is as sane as possible.
