Looking closer, I think we already have it.
It's called /proc/NNN/root.
Does chroot into /proc/NNN/root cause the chroot'ing process to adopt
the namespace of NNN?  Looking at the code, I think it does.
Furthermore, I think a daemon can acquire file descriptors for
multiple namespaces already, by open("/") and passing descriptors
between processes.  And the chroot can be done using /proc/self/fd/N
after receiving a descriptor.
This is because file descriptors, and current->fs->pwd and
current->fs->root, record the vfsmnt as well as the dentry that they
opened.
So no new system calls are needed.  A daemon to hand out per-user
namespaces (or any other policy) can be written using existing
kernels, and those namespaces can be joined using chroot.
That's the theory anyway.  It's always possible I misread the code (as
I don't use namespaces and don't have tools handy to try them).
