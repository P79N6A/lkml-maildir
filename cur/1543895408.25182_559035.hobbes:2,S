And if some of the sent files were unix sockets, rightly so, since the
sent sockets might need to be garbage collected.
And BTW the whole gc is done with the unix_table_lock held, so it will
stop some socket operations anyway.  The fact that it needs to stop
some more operations is a necessary thing.  But we are talking about a
_spinlocked_ region, which for zillions of sockets might run for a
long time, but it's not as if it's really going to affect performance
in real cases.
