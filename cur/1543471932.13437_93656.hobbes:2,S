I put out a new arca-57 patch. It would be nice if people with mm
unbalancing problems or people that is used to print using a parallel port
would try it.

Differences between linux-2.1.131-ac11 (you can sync with linux-2.1.131-ac11
with Alan Cox patches at 
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/alan/2.1/
)
and arca-57:
o	new IEEE1284 parport code from Tim Waugh with some fixes from me.
	It works fine here. It simplify radically the code of lp.c, the only
	not very cool thing is that it decrease the way the printer can be
	tuned via tunelp since IEEE1284 has its timings and its fixed way
	to work... It's very fun though, so try it an be happy ;)
o	get_wchan() moved in arch specific section and CTRL+SCROLL-LOCK
	use get_wchan() to get the PC filed information. Due this change
	the arca-56 kernel compile only on i386 and alpha (alpha is just
	uptodate too).
o	fixed page bound limits and the case of a new forked not
	scheduled yet process in get_wchan()
o	fixed a little bug in a emergency SMP code in irq.c (Ingo and
	Linus)
o	idle task reschedule fix
o	fixed APM that would go in ap_do_idle() even if the CPU is been
	busy for a lot of time
o	jiffies wrap update
o	fixed scsi code to not hang after ~0UL sec after the first
	scsi reset
o	ppa reset handler set (avoid kernel crash in case of reset of the
	ppa host forced by the scsi midlevel driver)
o	reimplemented time to jiffies functions handling all kind
	of overflows, it fixes also a schedule_timeout() printk flood
	due to an overflow in timeout = (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1; in poll()
o	removed unused flag from the mmstruct since we don't do aging
	anymore
o	new delayed ack heuristic invented by me to handle better
	performance on congestioned networks
o	the mm subsystem should be more balanced due a my change in
	do_try_to_free_pages(), this should avoid che cache to grow
	and then to decrease in cycle.
o	my own kswapd implementation that runs in background and
	schedule() as a normal process but with dynamic priority
o	little vmalloc fix
o	the kernel will boot in the past of one hour (see `uptime`), if in
	the first hour something screw up let me know because it means
	that you catched a probably trivially fixable jiffies wrap bug
o	some minor things
