Yes. It took me an extra cup of coffee to explain the idea. 
An important detail is that frontends would no longer contain
module_init() and module_exit() functions. Instead, the card driver
would call a function in the frontend module to attach the frontend
client to the tree and simultaneously set the correct parameters for
that specific card. This provides type safety, and a guarantee that the
client parameters match the correct card when mixing cards from
different manufacturers.

Possibly, though they tend to have very limited I2C controllers which
makes it more awkward.
