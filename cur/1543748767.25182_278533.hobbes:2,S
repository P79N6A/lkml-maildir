I forgot to ask a final thing:
What is the proper way of configuring my INT pin on the Host Controller?
I can choose:
level/edge triggered
high/low   active
I've been told that PCI interrupts are level trig. active low. Is this
true? I've seen another driver initialize to level trig. active high!
(not that I haven't tried all the 4 cases anyway...)
Thanx again,
