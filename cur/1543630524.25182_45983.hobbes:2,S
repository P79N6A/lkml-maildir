I like to see user application such as VNC, SAMBA build directly
on top of IB API.  I have couple of IB cards that can 
send 10k 32KBytes message (320MB of data) every ~1 second over 
1x link with only <7% CPU usage (single CPU xeon 700MHz).  
I was very impressed.  
Go thru the socket layer API would just slow thing down.
With IB bandwidth faster than standard 32/33MHZ PCI, one might
run DOOM over VNC over IB on remote computer faster 
than a normal PC running DOOM locally....
One might create a OS that miror the complete process state
info (replicate all the modified page) everytime that 
process is schedule out.
