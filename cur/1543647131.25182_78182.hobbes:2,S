*argh* I hate this! Just to doublecheck after I sent you the last mail
an hour or so ago, I did a recompile, fresh kernel-tree, just unrar'ed,
apply patch (just like I did earlier today), this time it Oopses again.
Every time. Earlier today, with same kernel, never any Oops. This is
incredibly weird. Anyway, here comes the Oops. I had to write it down by
hand, so it _might_ be some errors, but I really don't think so, I did
my best, and I even understood my notes when I wrote this textfile :)
Best regards,
