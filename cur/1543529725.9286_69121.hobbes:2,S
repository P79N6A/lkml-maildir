Thats a mess in more than one way. The code is design with have only one
card in your system in mind. Multihead it crokes.

Accels help alot. Semaphore would be the best solution.

Yep. This is one of the thing we are working on.

Me too. Email me the patch I will send it off to the linuxconsole project.
