My bad, see below, I just lucked out not to boot at the wrong time, and 
after that the problem doesn't happen (or is unlikely).

Okay, now I see what's happening. In arch/i386/kernel/time.c, the routine 
is far more limited than the comments admit. And the code tests for a 30 
minute change, while the comments only say 15.
Since the code change is complex, requiring backing the time over an hour 
and potentially date boundary, I just patch the comment to admit what's 
happening.

  Having the feature freeze for Linux 2.5 on Hallow'een is appropriate,
since using 2.5 kernels includes a lot of things jumping out of dark
corners to scare you.
