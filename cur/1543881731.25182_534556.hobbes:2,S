Right, and REQ_RW_SYNC isn't 1 either, so it returns a large number if
set.

I went to run a test testing many disks, with a fio file like so:
[root@AS4 ~]# cat many-rw-256 
[global]
rw=write
bs=256k
direct=1
ioengine=libaio
iodepth=4096
[md0]
file_service_type=roundrobin:16
filename=/dev/sdix:/dev/sdiw:/dev/sdiv:...
filename is 256 scsi disks, using scsi_debug. I wanted to evaluate the
possible extra CPU usage from one process with a lot of io contexts
attached. And the benefits of such a patch as this one:
