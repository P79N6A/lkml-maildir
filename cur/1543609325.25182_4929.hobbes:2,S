OK, I have found out that when I use three hosts to try to test SYN
cookies there is no pause, so the pause was a red herring.  However,
tests still seem to indicate that the SYN cookies feature doesn't do
anything. 
Host A sends a SYN flood to host B, now sporting a new 2.2.20 kernel
(with SYN cookie support, of course).  Host C makes repeated TCP
connections and ICMP echo requests to host B in order to monitor host
B.
However, even after setting tcp_max_syn_backlog to 1 on host B, I do
not observe any difference in connection times (from B to C) during a
SYN flood (from A to B) whether tcp_syncookies are on or off on host B
(1 or 0).  I am restarting the server on B each time I make an
adjustment in /proc.
Is there anyone who has any evidence that SYN cookies do anything in
kernel 2.2.x?  If so, how did you get that evidence, because I would
like to reproduce it.
