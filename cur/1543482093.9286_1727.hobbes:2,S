I doubt it. If it was bad hardware I'd be crashing all the time. This is
the *first* lock-up I've seen for a very long time (and I've been using
Linux since 2.0.27), I have had another report from someone else who
experienced the exact same lockup that I had.
And, my system is not overclocked (I want my machine to give me many years
of enjoyment, instead of running flat out and burning out shortly!), fans
are working properly. The system runs at very conservative settings which
ensures 24/7 100% high availablity except when the power goes out. 8)
I've been talking to that guy about the circumstances in which the lock-up
occurred. The only common factor between his and mine seems to be a fatal
cocktail of DDD & gdb that makes the kernel do a caca[1].
Cheers,
Alex.
