What, exactly, is the point of merging something that nobody is going 
to use unless they want to test it, in which case they can grab a patch 
from somewhere?
It's half the speed of the current system. The current system works, no 
matter how horrible its internals can be. That makes the NEW system 
BROKEN. If it's KNOWN to be BROKEN prior to merge then it shouldn't 
even be in a 2.5.*-pre#.
kbuild 2.4 works, but it's ugly! Let's create a new system!
You mean the new system is half the speed but it's more attractive? 
Well I guess we'll go with the new system anyway!
(sound familier?:
Oh look at this new processor with all this fancy shit from <company 
name withheld>! It even scales to absurdly high Mhz numbers!
Let's all spend a ton of money to get it!
Oh wait, you mean this old processor that costs nothing compared to the 
new one outperforms this new one? Oh well, let's get the new one anway!)
