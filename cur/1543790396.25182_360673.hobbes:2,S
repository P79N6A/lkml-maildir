Yes.  You don't need (unless there is a compeling reason) to compile
qlogicfc (CONFIG_SCSI_QLOGIC_FC) as the qla2xxx driver along with the
2200 and 2300 firmware mofules:
	CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2XXX=m
	CONFIG_SCSI_QLA22XX=m
	CONFIG_SCSI_QLA2300=m
will be fine.

Could you send me your .config file?  I have a fealing you have and
entry similar to the following:
	CONFIG_SCSI_QLOGIC_FC=m
in there.  Don't compile the qlogicfc driver.

Thats fine.

Not sure there, but the removal of the qlogicfc driver could help
clear up some of the noise, like...

this.  the qlogicfc driver is being loaded before qla2xxx and the
supporting 2200 firmware module.
