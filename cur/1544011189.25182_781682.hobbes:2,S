We accept temporary / hacky solutions as an exception and only when there is
a justified need, i.e. it fixes real user problem and we are close to release
date, or it is a standalone issue in a newly merged driver and we don't want
to delay it more from being used by users just because of it.  This is not
the case here.  The alone fact that you need such invasive temporary changes
is a hint that there is a problem with either the implemention or the proposed
solution.
Looking once again at the patchset, it doesn't seem to remove a single struct
ide_atapi_pc field.  The problem is just moved from one place into the other
introducing new design issues, clearly not an improvement.  This again seems
to come back to the approach taken for removing struct ide_atapi_pc (which is
a "hard" problem currently) -- if we stop being so focused on the idea that
struct ide_atapi_pc has to be removed _now_ at all cost and instead look into
possibilities of solving smaller problems, the big one may solve itself in
the meantime...
[ That being said it still good that you've posted this patchset early so we
  can still discuss it and potentially choose the other way before investing
  too much time into it. ]

Unfortunately no.  Sorry but upon closer look the new code is just broken.
Before the patchset we had separate fields (i.e. pc_flags) for drive->pc
and floppy->failed_pc.  After the changes we have a _single_ pc_flags for
both REQUEST SENSE packet command and the original failed packet command.
[ ->failed_pc is used to keep pointer to the failed packet command while
  the driver is issuing REQUEST SENSE pc to the device (=> drive->pc now
  points to REQUEST SENSE pc) ]
Since REQUEST SENSE pc is using exactly the same pc issue code path as any
other pc [ ide_issue_pc() ] the code will be incorrectly checking pc_flags
of the original pc (i.e. original pc may have PC_FLAG_DMA_OK set which will
be incorrect for REQUEST SENSE pc).

Or use mixed approach.

Well, we don't have to port ide-cd over struct ide_atapi_pc completely.
Moreover we can be fixing other drivers as we go (BTW I thought that all ATAPI
drivers have been already fixed WRT s/pc->c/rq->cmd/).

Yes, we have to be very careful with using private buffers by not increasing
stack usage too much.

Sure and I didn't question the goal.
What I was asking in my mail was for you to take your ide-cd maintainer hat
off for a minute and instead put IDE maintainer one on.  From the perspective
of the whole subsystem porting ide-cd over to ide-atapi is of much higher
importance than getting rid of struct ide_atapi_pc.  The former can be pretty
much done now and shouldn't really be difficult problem once you start working
towards solving it.  Porting ide-cd over ide-atapi will decrease the amount
of all ATAPI code and its complexity immediately enabling the possibility of
other improvements inside IDE subsystem itself (right now they would require
ide-cd specific changes), which in turn should give a feedback loop into
ide-cd which may as well help solving the other issue (struct ide_atapi_pc
removal).  OTOH having struct ide_atapi_pc removed just for the sake of it
alone wouldn't give us much benetifs, especially looking at the potential
time it will take to done properly.
[ Yes, I'm a bit disappointed that 2.6.29 is going to be the next release
  that we will miss on ide-cd -> ide-atapi conversion (I was initially
  hoping for .28) and the fact that in few weeks this will become a limiting
  factor to the further progress on core IDE changes (despite few issues
  to still take care of things are starting to look really well there)... ]
