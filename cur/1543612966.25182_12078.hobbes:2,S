Hi Kai,
I also got ACPI IRQ routing working on a system over the weekend. Sounds
like yours is better, so great we'll adopt yours. Thanks for stepping up on
this.

Like I said above, I think it's too early to be optimizing this code. My
main concern was more about integrating ACPI into pci-irq.c in a readable
manner. It is pretty $PIR-specific (no surprise there). Anyways let me work
with your new code and I will be able to comment more.

At this point, I'd think one to *enable* it would be better until the code
is tested more.
