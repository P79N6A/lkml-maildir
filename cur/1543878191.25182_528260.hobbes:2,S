Nah, just standard display algorithms.  Alignment doesn't change.

Because when you display the text, it doesn't affect the
alignment == indentation.  In fact you have to turn on
nonstandard editor options to even see if this happened.
Not everyone does so, which is why such things persist.
So in practical terms "\n \t" and "\n\t" are identical;
although the former "should not" be used, it doesn't
actually affect what CodingStyle is primarily trying to
control (i.e. what the code looks like).
