No. The directory is quite visible with a standard 'ls -a'. Instead,
they simply mark it as a separate volume/filesystem: i.e. the fsid
differs when you call stat(). The whole thing ends up acting rather like
our bind mounts.
It means that you avoid all those nasty user issues where people try to
hard link to/from .snapshot directories, rename files across snapshot
boundaries, etc.
