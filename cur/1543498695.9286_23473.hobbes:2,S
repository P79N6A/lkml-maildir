To say this in other words - what you're saying is that the system calls
on Linux are so slow that you can't use them to write network servers ?
And that the "correct" solution to that is to give up and put everything
inside the kernel ? 
This is a philosophy question of course, but, this surely must be a "road
to hell" because just as with direct device<->device HW serving, you'll
end up doing a lot of redundant code probably, and a lot of internal
kernel implementation dependencies.
Also this resembles our fine discussion on zero-copy fileserving. 
If the syscall latency really is that bad for performance (given that you
use sendfile() and friends), wouldn't a more modest approach be to
architecture some kind of "low latency service" layer, where these servers
can live. Kind of like kernel modules, but with a tighter API towards the
kernel. Something that both knfsd and khttpd could run on top of - like a
"generalized kttpd" but in another way than the original poster suggested.
How is this solved in other OS'es ? IS really a httpd on linux that bad ?
