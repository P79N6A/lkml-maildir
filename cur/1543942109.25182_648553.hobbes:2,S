Ah, but it's not ... the current patch is merely exporting an interface.
The debate in STGT vs SCST is not whether to export an interface but
where to draw the line.
You could also argue in the same vein that sd is redundant because a
filesystem could talk directly to the device via /dev/sgX (in fact OSD
based filesystems already do this).  The argument is true, but misses
the bigger picture that the interfaces exported by sd are more portable
(apply to non-SCSI block devices) and easier to use.

Look, just read the spec; SGPIO is a bus for driving enclosures ... it
doesn't require SES or SAF-TE or even any SCSI protocol.

Wrong ... we don't export non-SCSI devices as SCSI (with the single and
rather annoying exception of ATA via SAT).
