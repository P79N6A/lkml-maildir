Right.
On PARISC, I don't see where they are emulating compare and swap
as indicated.  They are doing the funny hashed spinlocks for the
atomic_t operations and bitops, but that is entirely different.
cmpxchg() has to operate in an environment where, unlike the atomic_t
and bitops, you cannot control the accessors to the object at all.
The DRM is the only place in the kernel that requires cmpxchg()
and you can thus make a list of what platform can provide cmpxchg()
by which ones support DRM and thus provide the cmpxchg() macro already
in asm/system.h
We really can't require support for this primitive kernel wide, it's
simply not possible on a couple chips.
