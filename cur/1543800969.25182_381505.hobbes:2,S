If you did that you did it wrong. The -stable patches are *not*
incremental, they all apply to the base 2.6.x kernel.
What you should have done is :
2.6.14 -> 2.6.14.1
then before applying the 2.6.14.2 patch you should have reverted the
2.6.14.1 patch
2.6.14.1 -> 2.6.14
Then you go from 2.6.14 directly to 2.6.14.2
2.6.14 -> 2.6.14.2
etc...
2.6.14.2 -> 2.6.14
2.6.14 -> 2.6.14.3
2.6.14.3 -> 2.6.14
2.6.14 -> 2.6.14.4
2.6.14.4 -> 2.6.14
2.6.14 -> 2.6.14.5
If what you say you did above actually worked that's pure luck.

No, just revert the 2.6.14.5 patch and you'll be left with a plain
2.6.14 to which you can then apply the 2.6.15 patch.
It's only ever "revert one, apply one".
I cover this in the "The 2.6.x.y kernels" section in
Documentation/applying-patches.txt , was that section not clear? If
not, then feel free to offer suggestions on how I can improve the
wording to make it more clear.
