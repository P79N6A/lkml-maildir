Hi,
Ok, so as far as I can see, we can only control the execution flow by modifying
values in the output list of the asm.
Do you think the following would work ?
#define MARK_JUMP(name, format, args...) \
        do { \
                char condition; \
                asm volatile(   ".section .markers, \"a\";\n\t" \
                                        ".long 0f;\n\t" \
                                        ".previous;\n\t" \
                                        "0:\n\t" \
                                        "movb $0,%1;\n\t" \
                                : "+m" (__marker_sequencer), \
                                "=r" (condition) : ); \
                if(unlikely(condition)) { \
                        MARK_CALL(name, format, ## args); \
                } \
        } while(0)
The jump is left to gcc, we only modify an immediate value (a byte) to change
the selection. The is no memory load involved on the fast path :
...
   6:   b0 00                   mov    $0x0,%al
   8:   84 c0                   test   %al,%al
   a:   75 07                   jne    13 <my_open+0x13>
   c:   b8 ff ff ff ff          mov    $0xffffffff,%eax
  11:   c9                      leave  
  12:   c3                      ret    
  13:   b8 01 00 00 00          mov    $0x1,%eax
  18:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   19 <my_open+0x19>
  1d:   c7 44 24 0c 00 00 00    movl   $0x0,0xc(%esp)
  24:   00 
  25:   c7 44 24 08 06 00 00    movl   $0x6,0x8(%esp)
  2c:   00 
  2d:   c7 44 24 04 02 00 00    movl   $0x2,0x4(%esp)
  34:   00 
  35:   c7 04 24 0c 00 00 00    movl   $0xc,(%esp)
  3c:   ff 15 94 00 00 00       call   *0x94
  42:   b8 01 00 00 00          mov    $0x1,%eax
  47:   e8 fc ff ff ff          call   48 <my_open+0x48>
  4c:   eb be                   jmp    c <my_open+0xc>
