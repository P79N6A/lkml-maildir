the DRM has some major 64-bit issues that we need to break backwards
compatibility we haven't simply be able to declare a time when the people
who need to work on it can spare the amount of time needed together...
I think the plan is to fix the issues in the DRM CVS and try and push them
to Linus in one big push which breaks all platforms together and we can
have a flag day....
One remaining issue is what types to use in the headers used in both
kernel/userspace, we don't want to have two separate headers (why should
we?) so what types should we use ... surely someone has done this before..
Regards,
Dave.
