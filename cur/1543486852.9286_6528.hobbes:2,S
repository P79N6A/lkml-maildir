Not as I read it:
:2.27.   What needs to be recompiled when upgrading from glibc 2.0 to glibc
:        2.1?
:
:{AJ,CG} If you just upgrade the glibc from 2.0.x (x <= 7) to 2.1, binaries
:that have been linked against glibc 2.0 will continue to work.
:
:If you compile your own binaries against glibc 2.1, you also need to
:recompile some other libraries.  The problem is that libio had to be
:changed and therefore libraries that are based or depend on the libio
:of glibc, e.g. ncurses or slang, need to be recompiled.  If you
:experience strange segmentation faults in your programs linked against
:glibc 2.1, you might need to recompile your libraries.
Ok, so readline wasn't mentioned there. I did recompile it, dunno why. I think
I traced some segfault in some program there, but can't remember.
