I guess I'm agnostic on the exact term used - but one point is that
this isn't intended just for the virtual server support that you're
working on, but rather any kernel facility that wants to be able to
associate data and/or behaviour with a group of processes (not
necessarily related by process inheritance, but where the grouping is
inherited at fork time). This includes Cpusets, and general resource
isolation/management, without virtualization.
Terms like "process group", "session", etc, are already used up. A
"container" seems like a reasonable term for a generic process
grouping from which the processes can't escape without root
privileges. Since you're not only "containing" processes but also
"virtualizing" them, the term "virtual server" would seem better for
your work, unless you were wanting to keep the same name as Solaris
Containers.

OK, I'll take a look at that.

As PaulJ mentioned, it's much more efficient to read this once for a
given container, rather than having to iterate over the whole of
/proc. If it's possible to use RCU for this, I'd be very happy to
change it to do that.

If the only way to get a process into a new container is to clone the
current container and shift the current process into it, that's a very
restrictive model, and too restrictive for some of the things that I
and others want to do. (E.g. moving a process between different
resource containers based on which client it's currently doing work;
adding a new process to an existing running job).
I'd be interested in supporting the clone-based model as well, though.
With the addition of that, it would always be possible for a subsystem
that wants to just support the clone model, to always fail its
can_attach_task() call to prevent the container system from moving
external processes into the container.

No, I'm putting a pointer for each independent hierarchy that you want
to maintain - multiple classes of resources can be tracked in the same
hierarchy. The max number of hierarchies is a number that's
configurable at compile time.

I think that nsproxy would be a good example of something that could
be attached  as a generic container subsystem. I'd need to make a
couple of additions - a way to dynamically create a new container at
fork/unshare time and move the newly unshared process into it, and a
way to auto-delete a container (see below), so I'm not suggesting it
quite yet.

There are too many different resources and competing views on resource
control to be able to handle this via a few extra flags, I think.

That's there for compatibility with cpusets. I was thinking of adding
an auto-delete option that does queue_work() to trigger a vfs_rmdir()
from the work queue, which would avoid the races that PaulJ was
concerned about. But I can also envisage more exotic cases where
userspace wants to do something more complex (e.g. read some final
accounting values) before deleting the container.
