With the merge of uCLinux there are more machines like this too. I've
been playing with one recently where alignment exceptions are imprecise
:)
Adding a probability to get_unaligned() lets _all_ architectures set
their own optimal threshold for when to emit inline load/store code, and
when to take the exception.... and the ones which will set that
threshold at 0% become an arch-specific special case which you really
don't have to care about.
