hopefully not sounding like a salesman.. ;)
compaq have something called IRC - integrated remote console. Which is
integrated into a lot of newer servers (and available as an ISA board for
older ones). This allows complete control of the server - from POST
messages, BIOS setup, OS and on via a serial line. (ie for a terminal or
modem.) Can do things like callback aswell.
It works by snooping/intercepting keyboard and text-mode graphics in some
way (not sure how). So the OS doesn't even need serial-line support.
Incredibly useful, but not used/known too much cause of course NT has no
plain text interface. But it is very suited to Unix OS's.

Paul Jakma.
Opinions are mine not Compaq's.
