Noticeable: the IDE initialization, more VM work, and MD should work in
every configuration.
Famous last words.

-----
 - pre9:
    - USB: documentation.
    - Yeah. MD/LVM should really be fixed this time.
    - SH architecture update
    - i810 RNG driver update
    - IDE-PCI: make sure we initialize the chipsets correctly
    - VIA IDE driver fixes
    - VM balancing, part 53761 of 798321
    - SCHED_YIELD cleanups
 - pre8:
    - initialize to zero -> put it in the .bss instead 
    - no extended dumb serial driver options, if no dumb serial driver
    - access() on a special file on a read-only filesystem is special.
    - DRM update
    - fix SCHED_YIELD problems.
    - quintela: fix the synchronous wait on kmem_cache_shrink().
      This should fix the mmap02 lockup.
    - syncppp got lost in the Makefile reshuffle. Unlose it.
    - firewire update
    - flock blocking list fix
    - correct watchdog initialization order
    - USB-storage: reset fixes. Race condition fixes.
    - USB: fix freeing already free'd device.
    - minix truncate fixes
    - USB: pack only the relevant subset, not the whole descriptor (so
      as to not create extra unaligned fields).
    - nfsfh: DCACHE_NFSD_DISCONNECTED checking typo
    - dquota silly bugfix
    - sound updates (get rid of check_region, check request_region() instead)
    - scsihosts boottime parameter passing
    - avoid double init of MD
    - eicon ISDN driver update
    - fix Cyrix MTRR thinko
    - toshiba driver 2.4.x update
    - Makefile subdirectory traversal cleanup and documentation
    - cciss typos from bad merge fixed
    - cdrom driver oops fix for CONFIG_SYSCTL=y CONFIG_PROC_FS=n
    - coda initialization - we already did the module_init, no need for
      the extra double init. 
 - pre7:
    - USB: remember to release the kernel lock and other updates..
    - recognize the k6 model 13: it's a K6-2+ mobile processor.
    - file locking deadlock detection bugfix..
    - NFSv3 is not really really experimental any more.
    - don't raise privileges when re-trying a failed NFS RPM request
    - alpha cross-compile fixes..
    - sound init cleanups
    - shm statistics bugfix.
    - nfsd: mark us as a O_LARGEFILE case, so that the VFS allows
      the full 64-bit access..
    - fix up ac97 codec initialization
    - Ingo: clean up VM handling, improve balancing.
    - add SGI PCI ID's.
    - export the new lock copy/init functions
    - cs4281 sound driver
    - official Compaq CISS driver.
 - pre6:
    - TUN/TAP driver: use proper device number (misc device, minor=200).
    - teach st.c about some SCSI tapes that really aren't SCSI tapes (OnStream)
    - samba 2.2 needs leases for efficient file sharing.  They are kind
      of like file locks with async IO notification.
    - broadcast I/O APIC interrupt MP-tables are legal..
    - alpha RTC year magic again..
    - careful memory ordering by Andrea..
    - make the scsi-generic module work properly again.
    - file locking fixes
    - update atp ISA net driver
    - VIA IDE driver bugfixes
    - more linux-2.2 driver sync-ups
    - new PCI ids
    - emu10k stereo sound fix.
    - makefile documentation update
    - USB uhci updates
    - networking updates
    - codafs fixups
    - VM UP deadlock fix
    - Add Camino chipset ID to eepro100 driver. 
 - pre5:
    - Make SCSI initialization order be same as before.
    - fix cardbus bridge resources..
    - don't disallow Onstream ide-scsi devices
    - byteorder: use statement expressions instead of macros, to avoid argument re-use.
    - codafs update
    - more USB updates
    - _fput/__fput are no longer used. 
    - ixj telephony driver fixes
    - pmac SCSI driver init update
    - Andries: net device name allocation as in 2.2.x
    - sis900 driver update
    - more drivers synced to Alan's 2.2.x changes
 - pre4:
    - continued SCSI cleanup
    - more USB updates
 - pre3:
    - USB updates
    - NFS over TCP - handle TCP socket writability right..
    - NFS cache coherency across file locking fix
    - floppy: we'd better hold the io_request_lock when playing with "CURRENT".
    - acenic driver update
    - ARM update (including ARM drivers)
    - adfs correct dentry operations
    - netfilter update
    - networking updates (iipv6 works non-modular etc)
    - Sync up with Alans 2.2.x driver changes
    - SCSI initialization - move over to the modular case. No more
      double initialization.
    - block_prepare_write and block_truncate_page: if the page is
      up-to-date, then so are the buffer heads inside it once they
      are mapped..
    - uninitialized == zero. Remove extra initializers.
 - pre2:
    - scsi fixes
    - network updates
    - PCI bridge scanning fix: assign numbers properly
    - sparc updates
    - Riel VM update
    - disallow re-mounting same filesystem in same place multiple times.
      Too confusing. And /etc/mtab gets strange.
    - PPC updates (including PPC-related drivers etc)
    - more initcall updates
    - various net drvr updates and fixes
    - "extern inline" -> "static inline".  It doesn't matter right now,
      but it's proactive for future gcc versions.
 - pre1:
    - MM balancing (Rik Riel)
    - pcmcia debounce logic. Ugh.
    - 3c59x driver update
    - SysKonnect gigabit driver update
    - ACPI interpreter updates (and file renames - making this part big)
    - don't do notifier locking at low level: higher levels do (or
      should do) this already. 
    - truncate unmapped/uptodate case handled correctly
    - IDE driver picks up master/slave relationships on its own.
    - misc small fixes to random drivers by Tigran
    - mktime(). Do it just once - not 16 times.
    - NFS sillyrename fixups
    - acenic update
    - epic100 credits, 8139too driver update, sr.c initcalls
    - name clash in hamradio/pi2.c and hamradio/pt.c  
    - sparc64: register window race. Non-deadlock rwlocks.
    - USB: storage update
    - USB: OHCI controller unlink and bandwidth reclamation fixes
