So, your excuse for bad code is that you want to avoid a discussion?
Are you new here? ;)

I'd start with the comment, and work from there.  
ISOLATE_PAGE_NOT_LRU
ISOLATE_PAGE_REMOVED_FROM_LRU
ISOLATE_PAGE_FREEING_ELSEWHERE
Not my best names in history, but probably a place to start.  It keeps
the author from having to add bad comments explaining what the code
does.

Hirokazu's page migration patches have some functions called the exact
same things: __putback_page_to_lru, etc... although they are simpler.
Not my code, but it would be nice to acknowledge if ideas were coming
from there.
