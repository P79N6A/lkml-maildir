Hmm..  I just checked Ralf Brown's out and E820 doesn't appear to
give cache info, or if it does, then the returned data would be
"reserved" according to the INT list.
Does anyone have more comprehensive (if that is possible) info on
the E820 BIOS calls?
Is it possible to read this info from the chipset itself?
Granted, it would be chipset specific likely, but that is ok...
;o)
Thanks for the hint Alan.
