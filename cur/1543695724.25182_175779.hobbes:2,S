Where can I find a step by step tutorial on installing alsa since OSS 
has been deprecated?  I've been using the shareware OSS on this mobo 
for years, the audio chipset is VIA 8233 family.  I have as much of 
it compiled into the kernel as there are checkmarks in kconfig but 
nothing soundwise is working yet.  I also put that LXD option on the 
grub line, but thats being ignored, the dmesg comment is still there.
If grub.conf wasn't where it goes, please advise on that too.
I've been booted to this for about 10 hours now, and so far sound is 
the only thing not working that I've needed.  Not all of my usb stuff 
has been exercized yet though.
So far it just plain feels good, congrats to all involved.
Mmm, the pair of warnings about the check_region call being deprecated 
are still there in the advansys driver, but it worked normally for 
amanda last night.
