     Get back to me in a decade and ask the same question.
     Broken behavior in one filesystem is not the "weight of years of
     accumulated cruft".

     Hey, if I could take 2.2.x device drivers and plug them into
     1.2.13, I'd do that and get 220k back on my install floppies.  But,
     oddly enough, there have been 4 releases of the kernel since then
     with 4 different device driver interfaces (and nothing but paranoia
     and contempt for any attempts to publish a driver interface), so
     nothing will work without massive hackery.
     But why the devil should I reward sloppy coding practices by taking
     all my toys and playing with a different crowd?  Even if Linux
     wasn't Unix's only hope, there are massive benefits to making it
     easy to upgrade to new kernels.
