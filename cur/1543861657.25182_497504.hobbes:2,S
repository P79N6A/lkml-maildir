True - however if you look at the underlying link for those you'll
notice that most of the links will continue to use www2 instead of www.
The ones that explicitly point to www probably have a good reason for
doing so, but I'll have to check on that.  Regardless the kernel.org
webpages need some work and it's on my todo list (maybe I should post
that somewhere...)

Could, but the bigger problem seems to be people explicitly pointing
rsync at 1 instead of the generic name or 2.  Beyond that traffic seems
to distribute as we are expecting.

The frontpage itself cache's pretty nicely and the upper 'dynamic'
content isn't constantly being generated on every page request so by and
large this caches and we don't have any real issue with it.

While I agree that most users don't care, they are useful.  If someone
notices that 1 has an incredibly high load and moving lots of traffic in
comparison to 2, than they can manually redirect to 2 for better &
faster service on their own.  Since these images aren't particularly big
they cache just fine and it's not that big of a deal, and there are much
longer poles in the tent right now.

Honestly - negligible at best.  We have bigger issues from trying to
service 200 seperate rsync processes on top of http, ftp, git, gitweb,
etc than worying about a couple of small, 90% static pages.
