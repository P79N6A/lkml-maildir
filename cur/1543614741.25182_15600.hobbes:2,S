I tested this patch and unfortunately, I have to say, it is not working
(if it should prevent the suddenly changing time on VIA-boards).
I have the same problem with suddenly changing time as without this patch.
Furthermore, there are these entries in messages. They came in while
printing via parport to printer HP6P.

Kernel tells that lp0 uses
"lp0: ECP mode".
I configured in modules.conf:
	alias parport_lowlevel  parport_pc
	options parport_pc      io=0x278 irq=5 dma=3
which should be correct regarding bios configurations.
Unfortunately I can't say, if these entries came in before or after the
problem with the changing time.
The entries in messages and the time changing problem appeared during a 
lot of diskusage (io).

Andreas Hartmann
