They show a relationship, yes.  And it would be nice to be able to try
to keep that link around if possible.
But what devices currently have this problem?  I only thought network
devices renamed themselves, and there are no symlinks to those devices,
only out from it.  In grepping the tree, they seem like the only users
of this functionality, and they would never need the symlink "reaname".
