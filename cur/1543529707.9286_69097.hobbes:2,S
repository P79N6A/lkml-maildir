Argh. What's the screams all over the place ? You CAN NOT boot Linux without
command line option. I repeat. You CAN NOT boot Linux without using command
line option. Never was, never will. You MUST specify at least one option:
root=blah-blah-blah ... This option is not specifyed as append=... in LiLo
but, for example, in loadlin you must specify it explicitly. And compiled
defaults (where you need to RECOMPILE kernel just to reflect changes in
jumper settings) are kludges. Thus they were removed (not all I afraid).
