6. Why does my kernel compilation stops at random locations with:
"Internal compiler error: program cc1 caught fatal signal 11."? 
            (REW) Sometimes bad hardware causes this. Read the Web page
at 
http://www.BitWizard.nl/sig11/
 about this. The important word here is
random. If it stops at the same place every time, the kernel source
might have a glitch or your compiler might be bad. The Web page is
mostly about the random error source: hardware. There is a bunch of
different error messages that you can get if you have bad or marginal
hardware.
            (ADB) Overclocked processors very often fail long
compilations with a sig11, because a long gcc compilation puts more
strain on the processor. As the processor heats up, it may attain a
point where internal timings get out of spec. At this point, something
gives and you get a sig11. Also, some old K6 revisions would sig11 when
compiling large programs if > 32 Mb of RAM were installed on the Linux
box. AMD will exchange these faulty processors for free. Benoit
Poulot-Cazajous correctly diagnosed the problem and devised an ingenious
test for this bug that is run at boot time in 2.2.x kernels.
