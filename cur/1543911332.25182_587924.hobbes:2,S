Subject: 2.6.23-rc3 issues: AMD64 laptop hard-reboots soon after executing init

That pretty much sums it up - It's an x86_64 system, I pulled my
2.6.20 .config file over, verified settings in make menuconfig, built
it, and, if I use my normal init system (Gentoo distro), the laptop
does a hard reboot just a little bit before I would hit a login
prompt. If I append init=/bin/bash, I get the same behaviour after
about the same time (but I do get a bash prompt). I have tried several
different configurations (mostly playing around with ACPI/Power
Management and company), but I haven't been able to track it down. No
oops messages, nothing informational (that I've been able to see), no
warning, doesn't matter if it's just idle or if I'm doing something -
I just suddenly get hard rebooted (no controlled shutdown, the screen
just goes blank, and suddenly I'm back at the BIOS memory test
screen).
I'm not sure what will be useful for tracking this down, so I've
attached several things - dmesg output from 2.6.20 (good) and
2.6.23-rc3, and my .config files from 2.6.20 and 2.6.23-rc3.
Any other information needed? Any suggestions what to
enable/disable/etc in the configuration?
