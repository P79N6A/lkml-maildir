Ah, thanks for pointing it out, I try to forget my forays into the ACPI
code :)
But even then, you are building up a few pci structures yourself to talk
to the pci device.  In looking at the few places you call this function,
is there any reason that acpi_ex_pci_config_space_handler() can't just
call pci_bus_* itself, instead of having to go through
acpi_os_read_pci_configuration()?  If so, the one other usage of the
acpi_os_read_pci_configuration() can cause that function to be
simplified a lot.
Anyway, this is a nice diversion from the real problem here, for 2.4,
should I just backport the pci_ops changes which will allow pci
hotplugging to work again on ia64, or do we want to do something else?
thanks,
