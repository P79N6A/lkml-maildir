Subject: suspend/hibernation regression between 2.6.19 and 2.6.20 w/ Thinkpad T41

It is a small - but IMHO nagging - regression between these 2 kernel versions.
To make a "software suspend" at this notebook ("suspend to RAM") you have
to press <Fn>+ <F4>. Pressing the <Fn>-Key after that wakes up the notenbook.
If you hibernated the system ("suspend to disc"), you have to press the power
button to wake up the notebook.
But now there is an issue if you want to wake up this notebook, after it was
suspended with <Fn>+<F4> again. It is now not possible to wake it up with <Fn>,
instead you have to press the power button as you would have it to do after a
hibernation.
This issue occures in the current 2.6.21 kernel too.
(all tested at a stable Gentoo system - also with git-kernel-versions).
