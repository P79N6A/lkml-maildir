Yes, I was just looking into the locking... But it's rather messy with locks
between calls and goto's and I think I'd better get some sleep before saying
anything for certain. Is there any reason holding the lock between
listening_get_first() and the first call to listening_get_next(), but not
between consecutive calls to listening_get_next()? Otherwise we could just
always release the lock in listening_get_first.
(All this applies to established_get_first/next too.)
OOPS, I just realizes we might be talking about different locks :)
I was talking about 
read_[un]lock_bh(&tp->syn_wait_lock); in listening_get_first/next
What lock are you talking about?
As far as I can see, in TCP_SEQ_STATE_OPENREQ tp->syn_wait_lock is always
held and in TCP_SEQ_STATE_LISTENING the tcp_listen_lock and so on?
