You mean like the "panic_on_oops" sysctl??  (implemented in i386 & ppc64)

Yes, kmsgdump is now here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.
Sorry about any confusion there.
From Vince:

Um, could you elaborate on why you would want that?
kmsgdump assumes that the entire floppy belongs to it, so there
should be plenty of room for multiple oopsen (although I don't
know what it does on disk-full....).
I plan to add support for > 32 KB log buf sizes, but that's all I have
planned for now.
