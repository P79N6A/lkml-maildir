I'm not sure that gets suspend2 any closer to merging. 225 small
patches is still awful lot of code :-(. Now... if something can be
done in userspace, it probably should. And I'm trying to show that
suspend2 functionality can indeed be done in userspace.
So... to get 225 patches in, you'll need to explain that
userland-swsusp can't work. If you can do that, please be nice and do
it soon, so that I don't waste too much time on userland-swsusp.
