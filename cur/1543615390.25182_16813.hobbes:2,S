Look at serial.c:
#if (LINUX_VERSION_CODE > 0x2032D && defined(CONFIG_DEVFS_FS))
        serial_driver.name = "tts/%d";
#else
        serial_driver.name = "ttyS";
#endif
tty_name will just print "ttyS".   So the transition for this case
was fixed->broken.

Oh dear.  Why cannot devfs expand the minor part itself?
It looks like all the drivers need to be given a %d, as Ivan suggests.  And we
need to audit all uses to make sure nobody is doing printk(driver.name);
I think it would be better to drop the printf control construct from the
names altogether.
