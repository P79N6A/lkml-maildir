It works nicely for many people.

Yes.  They are few, tho.  The USB-IF is currently working on a bootability
standard to eliminate this problem.

No correction.

See www.linux-usb.org for a link to a list of good devices.

THe stock kernel won't work.  There are patches floating around to make
this work.  Basically, the kernel needs to pause for a couple of seconds
before attempting to mount the root fs so that the plug-n-pray detection
can work, identify the drive, and get going.
