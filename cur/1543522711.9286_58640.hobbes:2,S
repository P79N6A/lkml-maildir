Works marvelously.  After a few open/closes by say xmms or others
(especially if you are piping multiple things into the card), it starts
fuzzying for the first few seconds of play back.  After a while it just
stops working (pure silence).  I have had the fuzz happen as module and
compiled in.  Havent yet experienced silence as compiled in (maybe
because I havent had it up that long).
I am using the Hoontech implimentation.  I am also using RedHat 6.1 with
all updates with kernel 2.3.40pre6.
