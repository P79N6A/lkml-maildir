BTW. I guess one reason why this stat isn't in the OOM output is
that it probably isn't a kernel bug (but a userspace leak). It's
relatively rare to have a kernel leak in the pagecache or anon
memory so it usually shows up in slab.
Actually I think the oom killer output is a bit too verbose... no
not so much verbose, but it doesn't present the information very
kindly to administrators. IMO, it could be presented better to
non kernel hackers.
