For example, we can make sure that the code in question that actually 
touches the hardware stays exactly the same, and then just move the 
interfaces around - and basically guarantee that _zero_ hardware-specific 
issues pop up when you switch over, for example.
That way there is a gradual change-over.
The other approach (which would be nice _too_) is to actually try to 
convert one clock source at a time. Why is that not an option?
