I don't understand the reasons for making the tainted string all the same 
length anyway. Why not just remove all the extra spaces?
Unless you know what you're looking for, I can assure you that:
Tainted: G    B SOMEOTHERTEXT
Is not intuitively readable (which text does B belong to?).
Tainted:    B SOMEOTHERTEXT
Is better, but still not very good. Why not drop the spaces?
3rd party parsing purposes?
