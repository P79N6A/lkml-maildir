The problem is that do_tty_hangup() in tty_io.h calls the
write wakeup callback with disabled interrupts. The
notes in this function question the validity of disabling
interrupts at that point. I'm not familiar enough with the
locking issues for this function to comment.
At some point ppp_synctty.c was changed to use
spin_lock_bh and spin_unlock_bh in the write wakeup callback.
These macros complain when called with interrupts disabled.
Perhaps changing ppp_synctty.c to use spin_lock_irqsave
and spin_lock_irqrestore is the best fix.
