I'm certainly not advocating a segmented scheme, the reasons, 
not the least of which, are that it won't work to allow access 
to more than 4GB.

Tell that to a customer that wants (for whatever reason) an intel
system.

Merced has it's own set of problems, not the least of which is the
dearth of applications from ISVs.

The question is: 
    A customer has a choice of OS vendors for the Intel 4P box
    with 64GB ram they have bought for 1/2 the price of an equiv
    native 64-bit box:
	1) NT 	(Which supports the PAE)
	2) Unixware (Which supports the PAE a couple of different ways)
	3) *BSD	  (Dunno PAE support)
	4) Linux  (no PAE support).
The customer wants to run oracle.   Oracle can take advantage of 
64 GB of ram under the first 2 choices, but not 3 and 4.  Which
OS is the customer going to choose.    Probably won't be linux.
If nothing else, implement the same API as Unixware does to get
application capture

I support it as well.  I still believe you need to provide an API
to allow application access to the PAE memory.  Can't use the segment
registers anyway for that purpose.
