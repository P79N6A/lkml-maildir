mm..  Given that you propose leaving bits out for the 2.6.23 merge, and
that changes are still pending and that nothing will _use_ the framework in
2.6.23 I'd be inclined to err on the side of caution and hold it all back
from 2.6.23.
This has the advantage that the merge will happen after the kernel-summit
containers discussion which I suspect will be an important point in the
life of this project...
