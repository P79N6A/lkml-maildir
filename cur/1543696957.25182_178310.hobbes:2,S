Actually, look closer. We don't do that.
Why? Check out get_signal_to_deliver(). And grok the absolute horridness.

No. If it happens during do_signal() (on x86 or ppc), we'd just not
_handle_ the signal at all. We'd return to user space, restart the system 
call, and handle the signal as the restarted system call is returning. No 
bug.
In short, even on ppc, the window _literally_ is "after we've returned, 
but before we restart".

It doesn't. 
The rule is: the restart_block is _only_ meaningful if you return 
-ERESTART_BLOCK. So at any other time it contains stale data.

You're missing that the only thing that ever looks at restart_block is the 
code that is inside the signal handling of ERESTART_BLOCK.
The bug was that sometimes we had _already_ done that ERESTART_BLOCK 
handling (correctly), but then basically "aborted" (thanks to another 
signal) before the restart had actually taken effect.
And that race literally is only in user mode.
