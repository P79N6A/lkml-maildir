Yes, that was an 'accident' from -v8, yes we did think the cmpxchg was
good, however I did get some spurious lockups on -v7, and I only noticed
the thing after I'd done most of the testing, so I decided to let it be
for now.
Let me put the cmpxchg back in and see if this is all still good (only
3*2*2 configs to test :-).
