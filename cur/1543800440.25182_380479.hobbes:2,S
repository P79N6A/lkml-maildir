Why would you "hardwire" it?
#export CC="distcc"
should do it.
It seems you forgot to specify the compiler:
#export CC="distcc <arch-blablabla->gcc" should be the correct way. What
I do is:
#export DISTCC_HOSTS="localhost <machine1 machine2 machineN>"
#make CC="distcc ccache gcc" -j5 bzImage modules
