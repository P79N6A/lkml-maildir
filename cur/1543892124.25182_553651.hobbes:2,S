It's not abusing the system because it was killed, it was killed because 
it was abusing the system and attempted to mlock more memory than allowed 
in its exclusive mems.  So we OOM the task but it can continue mlock'ing 
memory and intrude on the memory of other cpusets because of the 
TIF_MEMDIE exception and our SIGKILL hasn't been handled yet.
