Only as long as it's reusing the same gendisk for different devices,
more on that below.

And loops is broken the same way ;-)  This I need an blockdevice to actually
attach it scheme breaks in many ways, like the need to reset a gendisk
instead of allocating a new one, lots of warts in ->open and problems with
udev.  Just keep a single character device around for all administrative
work (like device mapper) - otoh if packet writing really moves to the
block layer all this is magically fixed..
