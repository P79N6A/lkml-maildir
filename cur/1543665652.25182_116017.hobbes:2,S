Hmm.  I don't know.   It looks like a tool chain problem.  Maybe
a very old/strange version of mknbi.  I have never seen a 1MB limit
on any of the tools.  Though I have not played with the version of
mknbi that came with netboot.
Anyway if you re-ask on the etherboot-users list I am certain someone
can get this sorted out for you.
