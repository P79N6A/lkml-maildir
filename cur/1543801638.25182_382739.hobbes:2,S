Hi Paul
Thanks for reviewing route code :)
As I said, the problem comes from 'route flush cache', that is periodically 
done by rt_run_flush(), triggered by rt_flush_timer.
The 10% of LOWMEM ram that was used by route-cache entries are pushed into rcu 
queues (with call_rcu_bh()) and network continue to receive
packets from *many* sources that want their route-cache entry.
