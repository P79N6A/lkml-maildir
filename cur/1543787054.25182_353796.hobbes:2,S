That's what *we* are concentrating on.  Technically, I have no problem
with the aic94xx driver being based on a domain device.  However, you
cannot have two separate transport classes for SAS.  So these two need
to be unified before this driver becomes includable.
It looks to me to be a fairly simple exercise to unify these two classes
giving LSI a functional interface and you a domain device based one and
removing all the duplication of mid-layer functionality as part of doing
this.

Actually, it was intended to be such.  The sysfs components of the
transport class are the unified management interface to the transport.

No, the point of a transport class is to export the underlying
attributes of the actual devices that are present.  This is supposed to
be independent of the driver used to connect to them (and that's what
your sas class breaks).

I've told you before, if you find something that's broken send a patch
in to fix it.  I've already told you why the code in sas_discover can't
work for other drivers (although I still don't have an explanation from
you of why scsi_scan_target can't work for sas_discover).

As I've already said several times you're welcome to send in a patch to
change this as well ... as long as you either don't break every other
driver, or fix them all with the patch.  You were given a step by step
procedure at least for the I replacement piece.

The only power of a maintainer is to say "no".  So, although I cannot
make you fix any of the problems in your submission, I can say no until
an acceptable submission comes along for this driver.  At this point, I
believe all the technical issues of what needs to happen are well
understood; I also believe that this is an important enough piece of
hardware that an acceptable driver will come along even if you want to
play dog in the manger, so all I can do is wait.
