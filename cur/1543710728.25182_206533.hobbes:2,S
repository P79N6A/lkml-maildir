I had the line "post-install emu10k1 /usr/local/etc/emu-script" in my 2.4 
/etc/modules.conf file which would tweak the OSS emu10k1 driver after it got 
loaded.
Moving that line to /etc/modprobe.conf gives me errors - basically the system 
is ignoring the line because its not valid anymore.
What's the preferred way of doing this now?
Cheers,
Mark.
