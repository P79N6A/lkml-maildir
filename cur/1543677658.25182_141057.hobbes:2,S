The situation is much worse.  The io_submit_one() code in 2.5.71 
distinguishes between conditions where io_submit should fail (which goto 
out_put_req) and conditions where the queued operation completes 
immediately (which result in a call to aio_complete()).  The patch in 
2.5.71-mm1 which separates out aio_setup_iocb() loses track of this 
distinction, mishandling any case where the queued operation completes 
immediately.  Aio poll, for instance, depends on being able to indicate 
immediate completion.
So the part of aio-01-retry.patch that splits out aio_setup_iocb() is 
completely broken.
