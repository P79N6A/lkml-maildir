Subject: [PATCH 2/3] [kbuild] Possibility to sanely link against off-directory .so
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/11/166

This patch introduces two special variables which make it actually possible
to link something against .so being built in another directory. The
variable $(<foo>-linkobjs) allows the user to specify additional objects
to link <foo> against, while not creating any dependencies of <foo> on the
objects.
I need this in order to link scripts/lxdialog/liblxdialog.so from
scripts/kconfig (I'll be able to build that lib thanks to the previous
patch and the actual change to make it a library will follow in the next
patch).
On 6 Nov 2002 Sam Ravnborg <sam@ravnborg.org> disputed this approach,
saying that such an extra complexity will bog the whole kernel build, but
this involves only the host tools build and there I think the extra penalty
is negligible. Also, .so has two users instead of a single one now, so it's
not that easy to use his suggested approach to offload the functionality to
the leaf makefiles.
