Do you mean, use the RTC interface itself (i.e. - turn the mfgpt driver
into an RTC driver), or just emulate parts of the RTC interface in the
MFGPT driver.   I would be fine with the second option - the first doesn't
really fit, since the only functionality the RTC and the MFGPT share is
the periodic interrupt feature (which is sub-optimal on RTC anyway).
If the "timer interrupt" feature feels tacked on, thats because it is.
The best use for the MFGPT block is to drive a duty cycle on the
output pin suitable for LEDs and such.  Most Geode customers would use 
it for that purpose.  Running a close second on the usefulness scale is
the watchdog timer - its always nice to have that sort of functionality 
available at the hardware level (and its a double bonus that the watchdog
can be set up to continue running while in suspend).
The interrupt/NMI functionality was added to the hardware for the BIOS to 
use, and we added it to the kernel driver for a sense of completeness.
I personally can't fathom anybody using the timers, and I would gladly 
remove them if nobody else can come up with a realistic usage model.

That was the plan - I do have a watchdog driver that I had when I first
wrote the MFGPT driver for a now defunct project.  I should dust it off
and add it in.
Thanks,
