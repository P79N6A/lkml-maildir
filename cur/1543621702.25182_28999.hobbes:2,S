Hi,
I have the same problem here... I reported it in another thread (look at "Reiserfs Corruption in 2.5.5-pre1")
Maybe it's something with devpts but I enabled only devfs...
If you start the gnome-terminal from an xterm for example it starts but hangs before or shortly after loading bash
Sometimes gnome-terminal starts without problems but most trys it hangs
If you strace gnome-terminal you can see an endless loop doing some funny things (I have deleted the output but I'll post it later the day, including "ps axlwww" output)
