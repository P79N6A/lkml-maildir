Hi Greg,
Good bug report.
> WARNING - broken Config.in!  CONFIG_XXX was not declared!
I'm applying a "vfix: shut the hell up" patch real soon now.
Most of these are harmless but I do have to stare closely at them
before I take out the "puts".
> WARNING - broken Config.in!  m was not declared!
Yes, that one is a genuine bug.  It's fixed in 2.2.0-pre7-ac4.

Ouch.  Yes.  After the next AC release, I am open to patches on
that one.

This is the notorious Nested Submenu bug.  I've got a fix in the
pipeline, it ought be merged two AC releases from now.
All these bugs have been in xconfig a long time.  I am fixing the old
bugs slowly because it's important to me not to introduce any *new* bugs.
Good bug report, thank you Greg.  If you want, check xconfig again in
about a week, and keep holding my feet to the fire on the ones that
aren't fixed yet.
