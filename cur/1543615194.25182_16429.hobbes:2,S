If it's got to be done, I'd much rather it were "page + offset", so that the
usbcore code can be simpler.  We know how to turn scatterlists into
bulk queued requests, so there's no need for anything more ... :)

I'm unclear on what "bouncing to lowmem" involves, but I'd rather avoid
teaching all three HCDs a second model for addressing transfer buffers.
At least until later in the 2.5 series, when we believe they'll share a lot
more common code and so that new model can be taught to just ONE
piece of code.  Fixing bugs in one place easier than in three!

Well then you'll  be glad to see a patch from me, soonish, that teaches
the usb-storage "transport" code to use bulk queueing.  That'll get the
bandwidth utilization up as high as it can get.  It won't address any of
these highmem issues though.
