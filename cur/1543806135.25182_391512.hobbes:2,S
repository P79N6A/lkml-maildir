No, it won't wait for anything, because if umount happened between 
mntput/dput, dentry is not in s_dshrinkers list.
if umount happens in parallell with dput() (where shrinker operations 
are), then it will behave ok - will wait for dput() and then umount. It 
was intended behaviour!
Also, please, note that such early mntput()'s are bugs!!! because such 
dentries can reference freed memory after last mntput(). And I remember 
some patches in 2.4.x/2.6.x which fixed this sequence everywhere.
