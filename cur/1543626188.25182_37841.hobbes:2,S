2.4.19-pre4-ac2 is the first kernel since ages that is able to boot up on
an Intel SC5x00 server with SDS2 board without either
- losing one processor
- losing one gig of RAM
- locking up in highmem
- locking up when loading the GDTH driver
2x 1,13GHz PIII Processor, 2 GB RAM, ServerWorks OSB5 chipset, GDTH
8523RZ controller driving four 36 GB U160 disks). Nice little box for
kernel compiles (actually it is a java application server running
apache / tomcat and various webapps, but until our stability issues
are ironed out I can play with it). 2.4.19pre4ac2 survived the
stress-kernel test from VA Linux for hours. Something no other kernel
in the 2.4 series was able to do. Now if I could please get a sensor
driver for the ADM1026...
