	Here's the problem. RedHat ships the code in "object code or 
executable form". This requires them to distribute the source code in 
the "preferred form for modifications". The problem is, the preferred 
form for modifications might well be Linus' BK tree, which RedHat 
might not even have!

	If you assume that live access to Linus' BK tree is the preferred 
form for modifying the Linux kernel, then RedHat can't ship a 
compiled kernel if they can't give people access to Linus' 
repository.
	The GPL is nonsense. Lots of people have suffered absurdities 
similar to this one in a crazy attempt to comply with it. I think if 
the people who *chose* it had to suffer its insanities a little, 
they'd think twice the next time they choose a license for their open 
source projects.
