He's saying that when you find the first invalid assertion, such as
not having CONFIG_RTC defined, when reading the .config file, you
should prompt for a fix.  Then once the input is taken, continue your
checks, prompting for each following problem as needed.

No, we're just asking you to make the CML2 parser more tolerant of old
and possibly broken configs.
I haven't looked at the parser in any detail, but I assume that there
are heirarchal configuration settings.  When there is a mis-match,
where a sub-option conflicts with an upper option, how hard would it
be to print a warning, and just reset the sub-option to an acceptable
state?
Going back to the original CONFIG_RTC bug report I filed, all I had to
do was fire up vi and edit the .config file to turn on CONFIG_RTC,
which I think is completely bogus.
CML2 should be able to say "Hey, you need RTC turned on since you've
got SMP on, but it's not.  Should I do this for you?  Yes/No"
For trully broken .configs, maybe it makes sense to just give up and
say "Hey!  This .config is totally bogus, can I just ignore it and
have you redo your config in a sane manner?"
Make the computer do the work, not the user.
