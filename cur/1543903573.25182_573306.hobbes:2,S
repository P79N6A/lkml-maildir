One problem is that those strings more often than not are involved in
some magic computation, like placing version and date information into
extracted output.  While an import of the unexpanded version is really
the sanest option, it might render the resulting code inoperable.
CVS diff itself reports those differences, too (and it makes for a
good quota of merge problems even in CVS), so it is not like we are in
bad company here.
Uh, strike that.
