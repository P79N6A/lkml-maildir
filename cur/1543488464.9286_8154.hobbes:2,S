For what it is worth, UNIX itself has been around for 30 years,
and now we have Linux.  I'd bet that should someone here decide
to reimplement MOSIX or clone it, that they could do it, and it
wouldn't take 20 years.  I'd bet that if someone were as
committed as Linus was creating Linux, that they could start such
a project, and get enough followers, coders, and hackers to whip
out a full clone/replacement of MOSIX before a year or 2 expired.
The internet, and the hacker community at large have done many
such undertakings allready.
Linux, GNU, Wine, DOSemu, KDE, GNOME, and many other projects
show that with enough dedication, anything can be done, and it
doesn't take 20 years.
