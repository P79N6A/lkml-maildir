I haven't been, but it doesn't look too painful to do it.  The Natsemi
SCx200 merge is what's screwing up BK's automerge of it (I hadn't updated
that tree since April...).
The move work took me a few hours last time I did it, I can resurrect that
now that there's interest.  Give me a few hours, today's kind of busy...
Thanks,
Matt
