What I'm going to say may not be popular, and probably won't win me
friends, but here it is anyhow:

I'm sorry it _is_ a public service.  Once tens of people started
contributing to it, it became one.  This is like saying that the
Washington Monument belongs to the peole that maintain it, any building
belongs to the repair crews and janitors.  I'm not saying that Linus is
necessarily a janitor, but when you consider how much of the Linux kernel
that he didn't write, you may relize that it's not just his kernel.  It
also belongs to every single person that has written even a single
line of code in it.
