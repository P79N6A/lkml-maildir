The IT8212 is not a fake raid card - it depends on the firmware whether
you see a drive per raid volume (hardware raid mode) or not (ATAPI
capable firmware). We've found the raid firmware seems quite
temperamental and there is little performance gain from raid 1 in
hardware over software so using md or device mapper is recommended for
that reason.
