Hi,  I know there is this option in the kernel:
Default RAM disk size
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM_SIZE
  The default value is 4096. Only change this if you know what are
  you doing. If you are using IBM S/390, then set this to 8192.
I grabbed that from ~/linux/Documentation/Configure.help.  I have never
gone about changing this before as the largest RAM disks I have delt
with were no larger than 3Mb.  But it defaults to 4Mb, so perhaps
increasing this would solve your problem.
