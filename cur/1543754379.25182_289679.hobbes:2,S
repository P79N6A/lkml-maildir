I'd think that adding nanoseconds to ns_at_last_tick is not a good idea.
It might minimize the error shortly after the tick, but not the total 
error average over the whole tick period. And it introduces clock jumps.
Tiny, but unnecessary.
Just as you say,

finetuning the scaling factor should be enough.
