Well, don't mistake me for being fanatical about it. Having the values
be static is cleaner, but if its a real performance issue, then clearly
performance wins.
I do like Ray's suggestion, and think using the inline'd function is
preferred to the raw variable, as it better establishes through use if
nothing else, the read-only nature of the value outside of ntp.
