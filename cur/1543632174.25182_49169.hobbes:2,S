Due to a error with merging some stuff from a older DJ tree. I fixed it
in the fbdev BK repository.

I'm even more disappointed that some people DONT test my patches especially
when I announce them and usually wait about 5 days before pushing them to 
Linus. Some of the changes I have done have been sitting around for months
in the DJ tree. The good news is that people can now look at skeletonfb.c
to see how to port the fbdev drivers to the new api. Of course I have a
feeling most will not bother so I will have to do it for them.
