Indeed.

Yes, it's more the inconsistency between the tests than the tests that
prompted me to try it, and the scale of the interactive performance
improvement was quite a surprise.
On the other hand, Alan is now reporting that on one of his workloads
it does cause erratic behaviour for interactive loads.  So this is
definitely not a cure-all.
We already do have some problems with excessive swap time being
consumed under some loads: I can reproduce stalls of several seconds
on a PAE box with simple "dd > /dev/sd*".  That's something I need to
follow up further once we've found the source of some SMP data
corruption we're still seeing on big boxes (I'll be sending patches
for a shm race shortly that we found while chasing this.)
I suspect we'll need to instrument the activity of the various lrus in
the VM more accurately before we'll ever understand _why_ the VM works
well or badly in any given situation.
Cheers,
 Stephen
