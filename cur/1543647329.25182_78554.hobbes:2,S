Well, the notion is to provide timers that have resolution
down into the micro seconds.  Since this take a bit more
overhead, we just set up an interrupt on an as needed
basis.  This is why we define both a high res and a low res
clock.  Timers on the low res clock will always use the 1/HZ
tick to drive them and thus do not introduce any additional
overhead.  If this is all that is needed the configure
option can be left off and only these timers will be
available.
On the other hand, if a user requires better resolution,
s/he just turns on the high-res option and incures the
overhead only when it is used and then only at timer expire
time.  Note that the only way to access a high-res timer is
via the POSIX clocks and timers API.  They are not available
to select or any other system call.
Making ticks shorter causes extra overhead ALL the time,
even when it is not needed.  Higher resolution is not free
in any case, but it is much closer to free with this patch
than by increasing HZ (which, of course, can still be
done).  Overhead wise and resolution wise, for timers, we
would be better off with a 1/HZ tick and the "on demand"
high-res interrupts this patch introduces.
