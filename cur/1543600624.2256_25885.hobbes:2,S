I'll merge the blkdev in pagecache very early in 2.5.x, but I'm a bit
nervous about merging it in 2.4.x.
That said, if you'll give a description of how you fixed the aliasing
issues etc, maybe I'd be less nervous. Putting it in the page cache is
100% the right thing to do, so in theory I'd really like to merge it
earlier rather than later, but...
