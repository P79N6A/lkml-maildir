Here's the disassembled code when using -Os. It seems it's optimised, as
with -O2. My GCC's version is 4.3.2 (Gentoo Linux).
If you want to test yourself, the output was generated with 'objdump -d
-S -a'.
What do you think?
static void print_that(unsigned long num)
{
	printf("input << 5 == %lu\n", num);

	return 0;
