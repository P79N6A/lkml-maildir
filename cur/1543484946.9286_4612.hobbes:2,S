I'm moving towards the more generic PPS API and the nanokernel
favoured by NTPv4. PPSkit-0.5 is a big step towards it, but it might
cause some problems due to the massive changes made (if it compiles,
it should be working as ever). Anyway, here're some facts:
			    NEWS for 0.5.0
+ Prepare for new ``nanokernel'' by moving closer to Dave Mills'
  naming convention, even if there are problems with namespaces:
  Renamed ``hardware_pps'' back to ``hardpps''. Re-introduced
  ``hardupdate'' as inline function.
+ Added test in adjtimex() to reject unsupported mode bits
  (``~ADJ_SERVED_MODE_BITS'') with ``EINVAL''.
+ Increased year in LSM file; it's 1999 for several days now :)
+ Moved kernel time related code from ``sched.c'' to ``time.c''
  (likewise for the header files ``sched.h'' and ``time.h'').
+ Added ``#ifdef CONFIG_NTP'' to remove unneeded code where NTP is not
  needed.
+ Split ``CONFIG_PPS_SYNC'' into ``CONFIG_NTP_PPS'' (basic PPS
  support) and ``CONFIG_NTP_PPS_SERIAL'' (support for PPS signal on
  serial port).  Added new ``CONFIG_NTP'' for basic NTP support
  (embedded systems might not want it).  Updated ``Configure.help'',
  all ``config.in''s and ``defconfig''s to have compatible defaults.
+ Merged patch into Linux 2.2.1 and included fix.
Here's the LSM entry:

Note: People living on "master.kernel.org" can find the stuff in my
home directory (~windl) as well.
Those looking for primitive designs can have a look at
TTLtoRS232.ps.gz, a simple converter to convert TTL-level PPS pulses
to RS232 level (yet untested, but built). Comments appreciated.

Ulrich Windl
