1) Moving from 2.2->2.4, it wouldn't work at all without a newer compiler and 
newer modutils, and it really helped to have a C library and eight zillion 
other things upgraded.  So talking about what 2.6 will need that's an amazing 
red herring.
2) In terms of a 2.4 backport, if the old stuff isn't removed (the current 
garbage that does menuconfig et al), then who cares?  It's another option 
they don't have to use.  It's also Marcelo's call.
3) The fact Linus was cc'd on this before I trimmed it suggests to me that 
people are still wishfully thinking that the battle they lost before the 
linux-kernel summit would just magically re-open at the last minute.  It's 
not about the fact that reiserfs, ext3, and a new VM subsystem went into 2.4 
but THIS is way too much, it's a group of people bitching about python 
because they don't like the concept of significant whitespace.  Technically 
speaking, this is another variant of the good old indentation/coding style 
thread that just won't die.
It's insidious, isn't it?
