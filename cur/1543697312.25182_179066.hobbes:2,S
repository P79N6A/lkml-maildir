On ppc32, we have started doing just that, a syscall called
sys_swapcontext that does all the variations of get/set_context.
We'll do as well on ppc64 soon.
It also helps perfs because on ppc, the kernel actually knows if
things like the FPU or the Altivec unit were ever used by the
process, and so if it's worth saving/restoring those registers
as part of the context.
