I did a little closer investigation. The BUG was triggered by a page with
page->mapping pointing to an address space of a mapped ext2 file
(page->mapping->a_ops == &ext2_aops). The page had PG_locked, PG_uptodate,
PG_active and PG_swap_cache set. The stack backstrace showed that kswapd
called do_try_to_free_pages, refill_inactive, swap_out, swap_out_mm,
swap_out_vma, try_to_swap_out and add_to_swap_cache where BUG hit.
The registers look good, the struct page looks good. I don't think that
this
was a random memory corruption.

I was refering to the "if (!order) goto try_again" ifs in alloc_pages, not
the "if (something) BUG()" ifs.
