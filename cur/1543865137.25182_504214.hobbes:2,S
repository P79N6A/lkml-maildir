If SGPIO is defined as a generic protocol, could there be bits that are
used universally by all controllers that support a SGPIO interface, and
then of course chipset specific bits as far as how this is used?  For
example, AHCI 1.1 specifies that Enclosure Management via SGPIO is 
supported, and uses the message interface defined in SFF-8485.  If there
are any parts to your implementation that are remotely standard, it would
be preferrable in my opinion to split them out into a separate file
so that you have vendor specific code in the driver, and generic sgpio
defines in a separate file that can be shared somehow.
Probably I should have more appropriately asked whether there were any
bits in this that could be made common :).
