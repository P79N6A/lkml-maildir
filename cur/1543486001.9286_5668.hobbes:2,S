Doesn't the cache just contain the pathnames of the libs? So if you have new
libs with the same name, the cache points to them now.
Also, as someone else asked on this thread, shouldn't all the bins in /sbin
be linked static? So that if you do mess up, at least you can boot the system
single-user... With glibc now, everything is linked dynamic even if u specify
-static because of nsswitch. You have to go through hoops to actually get a
static binary.
the make install_root=blah is the safest. (there is such a variable, right? or
do you have to do make install prefix=blah?)
