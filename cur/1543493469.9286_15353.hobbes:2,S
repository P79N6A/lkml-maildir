a conf deadline is rapidly approaching, and I am stuck trying to 
open a raw socket in the kernel.  I did build a small program to 
open a raw socket using socket(AF_INET,SOCK_RAW,IPPROTO_RAW)
this seems to work and gives me the deisred behavior in the context
of my program.  i want this same function basically in the kernel.
I tried sys_socket with the same parameters (and even placed some
printks in the kernel to see what my app did), but i still can't
get it to even create the socket.  
when i run my app, i find that sys_socket(2,3,255) is what is called
eventually.  but i tried that to no avail.  
Is there something else i need to do to get the raw socket.  -OR-
is there any other way to send a IP packet that i have populated
myself?
thanks
