I don't know the details (yet I hope), but I'm quite sure that interrupt 
handling in XT-PIC mode leads to problems on several SiS configurations 
(when you reorganize PCI cards in a system and the behaviour changes or 
when you disable the VGA IRQ and some things start to work, the suspect 
becomes obvious). One user reported that putting 2 disks on one channel 
instead of one on each (so 1 IRQ used instead of 2) solve instability 
issues too... I ruled out IDE driver problems several times by 
repeatedly checking the code and the run-time register values against 
known-good values. My lack of knowledge on the interrupt handling 
details is what prevents me from being 100% sure that the problem lies 
here. This is why I'm willing to work on this subject.

Now I remember why your name ringed a bell ! Thanks for your testing 
work on swsusp, my amount of free time went up thanks to 2.4's swsusp.
