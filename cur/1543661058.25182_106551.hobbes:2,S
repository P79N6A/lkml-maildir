You're rant is totally inappropinquate because:
 1 - this is a glibc issue, applications should not include kernel
     headers
 2 - there is no sendfile declaration in glibc's <unistd.h>
 3 - there _is_ a <sys/sendfile.h> for sendfile(64) in glibc
 4 - solaris _does_ have a linux-compatible sendfile now
