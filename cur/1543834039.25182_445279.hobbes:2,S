This patch also doesn't have a compile time known ring, it's using
get_kernel_cs() because the Xen method for booting native is dynamic and
would resolve to ring 0 in that case (XENFEAT_supervisor_mode_kernel).

I totally agree.  I actually started doing rearranging the patch order
last night and that was one of the bits that got consolidated.  It was
getting light this morning and I gave up since I was wasting lots of
time fixing patch rejects from all the rearranging, and needed a bit of
sleep before KS;-)

check and report back.
