We do want to keep a very tight handle on bloat in per-cpu
allocations.  By definition the total allocation is multiplied
by the number of cpus.  Only ia64 has outrageous numbers of
cpus in a single system image today ... but the trend in
multi-core chips looks to have a Moore's law arc to it, so
everyone is going to be looking at lots of cpus before long.
