No, he's talking about the gcc272 package that includes version 2.7.2.3
of gcc:
$ apt-cache show gcc272

Installed-Size: 1596
Maintainer: Debian GCC maintainers <gcc@packages.debian.org>
Version: 2.7.2.3-16

 This is the old version of the GNU C compiler's C part. It should only
 be used for backward compatibility purposes.
