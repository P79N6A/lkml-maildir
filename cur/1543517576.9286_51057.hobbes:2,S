Hi!
I sent this message to linux-scsi a couple of days ago but unfortunately
didn't arouse that much interest. However, since this one's pretty crucial
for my work on noflushd, I'm trying linux-kernel as well. The bottom line
is: Is the patch below save, and if no, under which conditions can it
break?
By the way: I see rw_intr - running in bottom half/interrupt context -
calling requeue_sd_request() calling scsi_do_cmd() calling SCSI_SLEEP
(under certain circumstances). Is this the sleep guaranteed to never
trigger when called from an interrupt context?
Regards,
Daniel.

Hi!
I'm currently working on a userland daemon to spin down idle disks. While
IDE support is fine, SCSI turns out as a problem. The reason is that
unlike IDE, the current SCSI implementation won't try a spinup if a spun
down disk is accessed.
Below you'll find a - completely untested - patch against stock 2.3.28,
that tries to add spinup support. Since I don't really understand what I
am doing here but merely ripped out some parts from the infamous
scsi-idle-patch, I'd be happy if someout could glance over it and tell me
what kind of Bad Things I introduced. 
I've seen the spinup code in sd_init_onedisk() using sd_wait_cmd() which
Alan came up with during his cleanups. I've also seen a lot of weird
locking stuff going on there. But I'd like to issue the spinup from
rw_intr, so the semaphores are out. Now is it safe to issue a cmd from
rw_intr without any further locks held or which looks would I have to
acquire? Or is it just a stupid thing to do anyway?
Regards,
Daniel.
