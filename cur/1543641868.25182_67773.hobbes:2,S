Hi.
I have some bash code (to probe hardware), an hardware/driver database
and a python script to partly generate the database direct from
kernel sources.
It should be in 
http://people.debian.org/~cate/files/kautoconfigure
and in 
http://people.debian.org/~cate/files/gnome-os
If someone find it usefull I can continue to work on that.
ciao
