I understand that. But who would care about specific minor numbers?
Hmm how does your patch relate to this: 
http://lwn.net/Articles/110426/
As an aside, I also notice on my system from the following output that
the limit of the number of partitions for a sata/scsi disk seems to be 15:
$ ls -la /dev/sd[ab]
brw-rw---- 1 root disk    8,  0 2007-11-13 10:35 /dev/sda
brw-rw---- 1 root plugdev 8, 16 2008-03-06 12:11 /dev/sdb
