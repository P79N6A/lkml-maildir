generally the preferred way is for you to use request_firmware() API
which causes userspace to upload it to you via standard mechanisms.
This avoids kernel size bloat if it's not needed (by only having the
firmware in memory that is really really needed) and also avoids the
entire question of "can it be done within GPL" (not saying it can or
cannot, but usually if someone asks its a huge flamewar and this just
sidesteps the entire issue)
