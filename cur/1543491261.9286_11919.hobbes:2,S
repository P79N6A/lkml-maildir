I want to do some experimenting to see if I can build a repository with 
the complete history of the kernel in it.  When I get it done, I'll make
it available.  I'm planning on using Riley's set of tarballs listed on
his web page - is there anyone out there who knows of the location of any
of the missing tarballs?  Speak now so they can be included.  See 
	
http://www.MemAlpha.cx/kernel.versions.html
for the list to date.
