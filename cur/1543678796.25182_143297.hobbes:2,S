my current code including the older 2.4.21rc8aa1 does that too, merged
from your previous patches.

this sounds like an hack, forbidding merges is pretty bad for
performance in general, of course most of the merging happens in between
the unplugs, but during heavy I/O with frequent unplugs from many
readers this may hurt performance. And as you said this mostly has the
advantage of limiting the size of the queue, like I enforce in my tree
with the elevator-lowlatency. I doubt this is right.

I got a few complains for performance slowdown, originally it was 2MB,
so I increased it to 4, from 4M it should be enough for most hardware.

Yes, it largely depends on the speed of the device.

this is very similar to my status in -aa, exept for the hack that
forbids merging which I think is wrong and the fact you miss the 
wake_up_nr that I added to give a meaning to the batching again and that
you don't avoid the unplugs in get_request_wait_wakeup until the queue
is empty. I mean this:
+static void get_request_wait_wakeup(request_queue_t *q, int rw)
+{
+	/*
+	 * avoid losing an unplug if a second __get_request_wait did the
+	 * generic_unplug_device while our __get_request_wait was
running
+	 * w/o the queue_lock held and w/ our request out of the queue.
+	 */
+	if (q->rq[rw].count == 0 && waitqueue_active(&q->wait_for_requests[rw]))
+		__generic_unplug_device(q);
+}
+
you said last week the above is racy and it even hanged your box, could
you elaborate? The above is in 2.4.21rc8aa1 and it works fine so far
(though especially the race in wait_for_request is never been known to
be reproducible)
thanks,
Andrea
