Subject: BUG: 2.4.21-rc-ac3 [drm:i830_wait_ring] *ERROR*

Hi Alan,
	I've got the following error from the i830 drm modules. I attach the 
relevant lines, including when X/drm was started. The X server (4.3) was 
killed after the kernel gave the errors. 
It happened when I changed from X to a console via Ctrl-Alt-F8. I checked 
the sources:
if(time_before(end, jiffies))
                    ^^^^^^^
	DRM_ERROR("space: %d wanted %d\n", ring->space, n);
	DRM_ERROR("lockup\n");
Just in case, I had running my own program 
(
http://mnm.uib.es/~gallir/cpudyn/
) to change the frequency of the cpu 
dinamically according to the load. 
I tried to repeat it with _and_ without that daemon running (i.e. at 
constantfrequency) without success yet.
Regards,
PS: the laptop is a Dell X200, AGP is integrated in the kernel,
