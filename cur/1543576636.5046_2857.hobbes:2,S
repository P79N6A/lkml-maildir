	I would consider that application broken. The data connection should be
opened when it's needed, not left idle for hours and used later. If the data
connection does break somehow, there should be a provision for
re-establishing it without losing all application-level state.
	I'm not saying it shouldn't be possible to work around a defective
application protocol. But to expect there to be some easy way to just flip a
switch and fix it is unreasonable.
	The NAT may not even consider a keepalive to be activity. There's no
logical reason it should if the timeout is less than many hours.
