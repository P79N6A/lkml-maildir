The comment attached to the drop-in replacement patch is wrong:
| [1. text/plain; add-sem_is_read-write_locked.patch]   
| 
| From: Rik Van Riel <riel@redhat.com>
| 
| Add sem_is_read/write_locked functions to the read/write semaphores, along the
| same lines of the *_is_locked spinlock functions.  The swap token tuning patch
| uses sem_is_read_locked; sem_is_write_locked is added for completeness.
The function names you've used are incorrect.
Furthermore, the substance of the patch is wrong in a number of ways:

This uses the function wrong name. And:

Is inconsistent, though the tests are valid.
Also, you don't need to bracket the expression handed to the return directive,
but that's a minor matter.
