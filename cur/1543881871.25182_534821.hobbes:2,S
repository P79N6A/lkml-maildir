just found and fixed the bug below in SysRq-T - should be included in 
v2.6.21 i think.
-------------------------->
Subject: [patch] make SysRq-T show all tasks again
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
show_state() (SysRq-T) developed the buggy habbit of not showing 
TASK_RUNNING tasks. This was due to the mistaken belief that 
state_filter == -1 would be a pass-through filter - while in reality it 
did not let TASK_RUNNING == 0 p->state values through.
(fix this be restoring the original '!state_filter means all tasks' 
special-case i had in the original version. Test-built and test-booted 
on i686, SysRq-T now works as intended.)
