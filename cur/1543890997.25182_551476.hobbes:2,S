Yes.
I just ran it for a little while and nothing fell over, and level
triggered irqs continued to migrate.  So it's not horribly broken.
Outside of implementation errors the worst case that can happen with
this code is the current behavior, with a small slow down.
So since I can not reproduce the original problem I would appreciate
an eyeball or two more just to make certain I reimplemented this
correctly and didn't do anything stupid.   But I don't expect anything
to be found.  The code is pretty straight forward.
