Even though I have some boxes which are hurt by this, I have to agree, 
although I wouldn't be unhappy if there were a few more options to 
enable just parts of ACPI. There are more important things, however, and 
since I can live with ACPI=force or no acpi at all it's an annoyance 
rather than an issue.
I have a few machines which are never going to 2.6 because their ACPI is 
totally broken and 2.6 APC no longer functions to turn the machine off. 
Since I expect 2.4 to be viable longer than the machines, I have no 
issues with that, either. If I don't have time to look at it why should 
I ask anyone else?
