THose patches come from someone who is pretending to be davej@redhat.com ;)
We suspect the culprit is git-intelfb, which does
 config FB_INTEL
 	tristate "Intel 830M/845G/852GM/855GM/865G support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
-	depends on FB && EXPERIMENTAL && PCI && X86_32
+	depends on FB && EXPERIMENTAL && PCI && X86
 	select AGP
 	select AGP_INTEL
 	select FB_MODE_HELPERS
It's rather nasty that this can break the build.
It also seems plain wrong to me that a "select AGP" can force CONFIG_AGP=y
into CONFIG_AGP=m.  There's no sense in that.
