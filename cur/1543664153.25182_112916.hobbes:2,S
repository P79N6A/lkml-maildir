There's bugs in the APIC that mean that once we get an error, we never
manage to get rid of it, I believe. I don't believe Intel have ever
acknowledged that or worked around it, but I think Sequent engineers spent
a lot of time with bus analysers, etc looking at this, and that was the
ultimate conclusion. It's not like we do anything with the error anyway, so
disabling it seemed like the prudent thing to do.
Now in the case Rusty has, would be nice to find why it's changed, this was
just a workaround. On the NUMA-Qs, this always happened, so it's not so
interesting ;-)
