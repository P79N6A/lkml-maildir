Arjan,
Unfortunetally my poor knowledge of Linux kernel mechanisms (and code!) prevents me from understanding what could be the causes for that overhead. Do you mean it is a hardware issue? Or is it a kernel one? Anyway another machine of mine, that is equipped with 2GB RAM, doesn't show any proportional reduction of low memory at all. So this makes me think (oh, dear!).
Anyway I started a little research (eh?) in Linux code in order to understand how the low memory mapping is done, just in case... Please be patient if what I've done shows nothing relevant for this subject.  
I've just read arch/x86/mm/init_32.c where, if I understand well(?) the mapping happens. I started from pagetable_init() following the flow to kernel_physical_mapping_init() where the hard work is done. Comments before this last function say that "maps the physical memory to kernel virtual address space, a total of max_low_pfn pages, by creating page tables starting from address PAGE_OFFSET".
Ok, then... max_low_pfn is set upon what the BIOS had provided in arch/x86/kernel/setup_32.c, by function find_max_low_pfn().
After having inserted a couple of printk() showing the value of max_low_pfn and pfn (a local variable of kernel_physical_mapping_init() that is incremented in a for() at each iteration, and which counts how many pages have really been mapped) in the relevant(?) sections/functions, this is the first part of dmesg:

I think it only remains to me to understand which policy /proc/meminfo uses in calculation of total low memory.
As for it is concerned with my other question, I understand yours and Alan replies on the PCI hole.
Thank you.
