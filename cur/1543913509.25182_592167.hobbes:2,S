That's the first line of encode_lookup:
	static int encode_lookup(struct xdr_stream *xdr, const struct qstr *name)
	{
		int len = name->len;
		__be32 *p;
		RESERVE_SPACE(8 + len);
So len is either very large, or it's just garbage.  Do you know if
fsstress is trying to do something with a particularly long filename
here?
