Someone at Intel can correct me, but I believe they use a modified MESI cache 
coherency protocol.  Note that this coherency does not guarantee indivisible 
read-modify-write operations unless atomic opcodes are used.  (xchg or lock 
<opcode>)

See Alan's and others' postings.  The kernel relies on the hardware to keep 
its act straight, then takes care of MMU coherency.

See 1 and 2.  Consider using futexes or some other mutex mechanism appropriate 
to user or kernel code.
