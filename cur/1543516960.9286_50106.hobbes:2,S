Hi All,
I have what seems like a simple question.
I have a Dell PowerEdge 1300 which has a dual processor motherboard but is
only fitted with one processor and some sort of 'dummy' board in the 2nd
processor slot.
Having just installed Redhat 6.1 on the machine I find that it has
installed 2.2.12-20smp by default (yes, I know that's a redhat-ism).
My question is; Do you see a problem running the smp kernel with a single
processor installed ?
Excuse my ignorance, I have searched the archives and come up empty on this
subject.
I just have no idea what implications might be in running the smp kernel
and as this machine is going to be a rather well used production squid
server, I don't want it falling in a heap because I 'assumed' everything
would be fine. By the way, the machine won't have a 2nd processor installed
anytime soon.
Any pointers or comments would be most appreciated.
Regards,
Brad.
