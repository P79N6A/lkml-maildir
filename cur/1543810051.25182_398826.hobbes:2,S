Hi,
I have a module from the 2.6.9 kernel that uses tcp_protocol which is no longer exported.  To use it I can EXPORT_SYMBOL(tcp_protocol) in ipv4/af_inet.c
However, I'd like to modify the module and post it for people with new kernels to also use without having to modify their ipv4 support in the kernel.  Has something else come along and deprecated tcp_protocol that I should use instead?
Thanks!
George
