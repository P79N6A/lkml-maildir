CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP was introduced in 2.6.24-rc1.
If I read this Kconfig.x86_64 correctly then it seems that DISCONTIG is 
still the default. Andy?
config ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_ENABLE
       bool
       depends on NUMA
       default y
config ARCH_DISCONTIGMEM_DEFAULT
        def_bool y
        depends on NUMA
config ARCH_SPARSEMEM_ENABLE
        def_bool y
        depends on (NUMA || EXPERIMENTAL)
        select SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP_ENABLE
config ARCH_MEMORY_PROBE
        def_bool y
        depends on MEMORY_HOTPLUG
config ARCH_FLATMEM_ENABLE
