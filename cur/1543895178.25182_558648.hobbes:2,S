Actually I don't keep a tree for header stuff (except for the automatic
export-to-userspace one at linux/kernel/git/dwmw2/kernel-headers.git
which just tracks Linus' tree.
I figure that keeping headers in shape is a task for _everyone_, which
is sort of why we now have the infrastructure for exporting them and
checking on that.
Could you include it in your kbuild tree, or would you like me to (try
to remember to) send it to Linus myself after 2.6.22 is out?
