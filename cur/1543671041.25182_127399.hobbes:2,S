Well, actually, it does -- that's the nature of language.
Anyway, the real point is (1) whether or not people understand what it
means, and (2) is it a `gratuitous' invention, in the sense that its
being used by only a very few people in place of a more commonly
accepted word, _only_ because of ignorance.
I don't think (1) is an issue, since canonicalize is a straight-forward
construction; indeed, since the usual meaning of `canonize' is the one I
quoted, I guarantee that using it to mean `make canonical' will get you
a few puzzled looks.
As for (2), I can't speak for the wider population, but as I said, I've
heard `canonicalize' used by programmers quite often, whereas I've
never, ever, heard `canonize' used in this context.  I think one reason
for its popularity is that it has a sort of charmingly tongue-twisting
sound to it, and I suspect many people use it because of that even
though they realize it's `not quite right.'  IOW, there's a good reason
for its use, beyond the mere ignorance of a few.
Anyway, my take: keep canonicalize, it's hip, it's now.
