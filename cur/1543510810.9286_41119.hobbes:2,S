BK has a distributed repository model with more than 8 years of proving 
at Sun.  
Furthermore, it seems that the push/pull model is supported by BK (in 
fact, that's the only model supported):
$ bk help pull
USAGE
    bk pull [-iqv]
    The pull command is used to update your repository as painlessly as
    possible.  The default behaviour is to pull changes from your parent
    repository and apply them with the minimal amount of human interaction.
    If there are no over lapping changes (on a per line basis, not a per
    file basis), then the changes are applied automatically.  This may
    not always produce the semantically correct result.
OPTIONS
    -i          force the resolution of changes to be interactive, do not
                apply changes automatically
    -q          be quiet
    -v          be verbose (these stack, the more you do the more verbose it
                gets, the default -is -vv)
    pull also accepts all options valid for resync.
SEE ALSO
    bk help parent
    bk help pull
    bk help resync
$ bk help push
USAGE
    bk push [-qv]
    The push command is used to update your parent repository with
    your work.  The push command will never create conflicts in the
    parent repository, instead it first does an implicit pull to make
    sure that your repository is a superset of your parent.  If there
    was new work in the parent, the push command will exit, to give
    you a chance to rebuild your tree and verify that the pull worked.
    If there is no new work in the parent, then the push command
    updates the parent and applies the changes.
OPTIONS
    -q		be quiet
    -v		be verbose (-vv, -vvv, ... for even more detail)
    push also accepts all options valid for resync.
SEE ALSO
    bk help parent
    bk help pull
    bk help resync
