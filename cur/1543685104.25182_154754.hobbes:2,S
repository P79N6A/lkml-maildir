No, you've got this backwards. The thud program is a short piece of code
written to allow other kernel developers to reliably reproduce a specific
problem with the scheduler - that is, when only a small number of maximally
interactive tasks suddenly become CPU hogs they were able to starve most other
processes for several seconds.  This is an entirely real world case (see my
original posting to explain this), and it causes problems because, as you say,
the scheduler is not psychic.
I say you've got it backwards because thud is a much simpler piece of code than
Konqueror + XFree86, and it is simpler because uses 'reverse-engineered'
knowledge about the scheduler to manipulate it's dynamic priority to the point
where the scheduler problems I reported could be reproduced. As Con's changes
have broken these assumptions, thud needs updating so that it can continue to
behave equivalently on the newer schedulers. (The changes I gave will have no
effect on the old versions of the scheduler)

I think you're confused between the thud test and the thud implementation.  The
thud implementation is a hacked up bit of C. The thud test is seeing a
maximally interactive task suddenly become a CPU hog. Once the implementation
no longer performs the test it ceases to be interesting[1], and it must be
updated, otherwise you aren't getting the test coverage you think you are
getting. 
Certainly, thud isn't the only program by which a scheduler should be measured.
If you have a better, more realistic and reproducible test case, or even just a
different one, which can help evaluate the performance of the interactivity
estimator then I'd love to see it :) (Actually, if you/someone can write a
simple program which can replace xmms skips as the standard "scheduler is
good/bad" benchmark that would be great. It wants to do n milliseconds of work
every m milliseconds and report the minimum/maximum/average time it took to do
the sleep and the work. Or something like that)

The scheduler DOES have to cope with tasks which behave oddly, because it can
make bad decisions, and it has to be able to recover quickly or these corner
cases may be used to form a denial of service attack.

That doesn't preclude making things better. Otherwise, why ditch the "good" 2.4
scheduler :)
