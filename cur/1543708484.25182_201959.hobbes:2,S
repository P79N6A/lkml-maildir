Why not use something like percent, parts per milion or whatever?

How do you solve this one?
I want to kill your system.
I launch task A, "semaphore grabber", that does filesystem
operations. Those need semaphores. I run it as "true background".
I wait for A to grab some lock, then I run B, which is while(1);
A holds lock that can not be unlocked, and your system is dead.
This may happen randomly, even without me on your system.
