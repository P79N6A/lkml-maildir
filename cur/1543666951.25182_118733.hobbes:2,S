Hi Martin,
The table isn't used at the moment, however at some point it should
be. I have been reluctant to change the driver over to the new hotplug
scheme since in the past there has been a significant number of AceNIC
users running on older kernels which do not have the hotplug
infrastructure (2.4.9 etc). On the other hand I don't remember hearing
from a single person who wanted to use AceNIC in a hotplug
environment.
Anyway most people seems to be at 2.4.18 or later these days so maybe
it is time to retire the old code. I will try to find time to take a
look at it (or if someone beats me to it and sends me a patch ... ;-)
Cheers,
Jes
PS: There is an email address listed in the driver, please CC patches
to it.
