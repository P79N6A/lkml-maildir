Yes, it's suboptimal, but an option.

I was referring to the small amount of space allowed for DMA
operations, obviously not the speed of accessing SRAM.

Ok, so you're looking for a complete change to the streaming DMA APIs,
I guess.  Possibly requiring another call to allocate streaming-capable
memory since kmalloced buffers can't be used directly on your arch (or
all arches).  I agree it's suboptimal, it's one option to make it work
in the current API.
