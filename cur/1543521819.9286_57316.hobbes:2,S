This "problem" was handled in the '50s when the National Bureau of
Standards, with the cooperation of the rest of the world's standards
bureaus created the notion of the leap-second. The NBS is now
known as NIST. They have a web-page www.nist.gov which is kind of
interesting. The leap-second swallows the time necessary to make
our time correspond with the rest of the time in the known universe,
in little increments, rather than having to add a whole day once
every 400 years. Further, it keeps daytime time in the daylight.
So there is no Feb 30, 2000.
Cheers,
