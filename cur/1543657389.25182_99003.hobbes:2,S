This is not correct.
The functions should either be removed completely (preferred, since they 
aren't even proper C syntax in the first place - since when do we put 
semicolons at the end of a function?) or the file should be taught to use 
proper "module_init()/module_exit()" semantics that work _correctly_ for 
both modules and built-in.
The patch just hides just _how_ crap this file is, and as such should not 
be applied. Crap doesn't get better from being hidden.
