Btw, what compiler version do you have? The UP+preempt bug is a real bug,
but as far as I've been able to find out it's almost impossible to get gcc
to actually generate code that might trigger it. So while it's entirely
possible that the bug you're seeing is due to the (now fixed) UP+preempt 
bug, it's also quite possible that there's something else going on too.
