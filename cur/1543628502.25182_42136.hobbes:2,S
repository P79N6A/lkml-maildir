all additional eyeballs are welcome :) The only volatile portion of the
migration concept is the initialization (when there is no migration
mechanizm yet to migrate the migration helper threads ... catch-22), the
actual migration part is much more robust than any previous attempt. (and
we had a fair number of approaches in the O(1) scheduler which were all
pretty intrusive and unrobust.)
