I'm not sure I would agree about distribution kernels, and kernel.org 
kernels certainly have the options to trade overhead for more response.

Let me agree with Mike and Con, I understand just well enough to pretty 
much leave them alone. The swappiness is available, that's one of the 
things which wants tuning. But the old 2.2 kernels did run better on 
small machines, even a stripped 2.6 kernel is slower.
