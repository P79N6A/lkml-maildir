Ups, sorry.

Doesn't work: the woken up thread could be woken up by chance through a 
signal, and then the task structure could go out of scope while wake_up 
is still running - oops. Seen on s390 with sysv msg.

poll_idle polls the need_resched flag, and next generation pentium 4 
cpus will poll the need_resched flag with the MONITOR/MWAIT 
instructions. We cannot rely on the async IPI.

The patch already contains the instrumentation - it only needs testing.
