No, I don't think I've ranted about 'restrict'. I think it's a reasonable 
solution for performance-critical code, and unlike the whole type-aliasing 
model, it actually works for the _sane_ cases (ie doing some operation 
over two arrays of the same type, and letting the compiler know that it 
can access the arrays without fearing that writing to one would affect 
reading from the other).
The problem with 'restrict' is that almost nobody uses it, and it does 
obviously require programmer input rather than the compiler doing it 
automatically. But it should work well as a way to get Fortran-like 
performance from HPC workloads written in C - which is where most of the 
people are who really want the alias analysis.

Yes. I think we could use it in the kernel, although I'm not sure how many 
cases we would ever find where we really care.
