G'day all,
I have a laptop (Dell Inspiron 8000) which has an Ati M4 Mobility.
The problem happens whan I try to do 3D stuff on it.
The example I am using is quake2 pointing at the Mesa GL drivers. (Redhat
7.1)
I get about 5-15 seconds into the demo when the whole machine locks up. It
sometimes comes back and says something along the lines of ~"R128 timed
out".
Some times I even get a message in /var/log/messages along the lines of 
"error in r128_flush_pixmap_cache" or something like that.
I don't have the laptop in front of me at the moment, and that is why my
recollection of the error messages is not precise.
I am wandering if this is a known bug, or new one, or if I am to blame.
BTW : I am running Redhat 7.1 with 2.4.2-2.
Mof.
