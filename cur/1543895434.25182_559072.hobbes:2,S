We're talking about emulating pathname-based security on SELinux.
Pathname-based security is inherently non-tranquil (names can change at
any time) and ambiguous (a single name may refer to different objects in
different namespaces, multiple names may refer to the same object in a
single namespace), and thus cannot possibly meet information flow  /
classical confinement requirements.  So using restorecond as the basis
for such an emulation loses nothing from what you already had.  Using
restorecond as the fundamental basis for the security of SELinux itself
would be a bad thing, agreed.

Understand that we view it as a method of last resort, only to be
considered after trying first to:
1) Configure policy transparently to label the file correctly at
creation time (based on the creating process' label, the parent
directory label, and the kind of file), or if that fails,
2) Modify the library or application code to label the file correctly at
creation time (e.g. when multiple files that should be protected
differently are created by the same process in the same directory,
e.g. /etc/passwd vs. /etc/shadow).

I think you misunderstand what I mean by named type transition here -
that is a reference to earlier discussions in this thread on extending
the SELinux type_transition statements to let the kernel directly label
new files based not only on creating process and parent directory label
but also the last component name.  With such an extension, SELinux could
directly distinguish e.g. /etc/shadow from /etc/passwd at file creation
time in the kernel without needing anything like restorecond in
userspace.  There is no temporary mislabeling with such a mechanism.
