Why is your smbd touching /dev/cpu/*/msr?  Something is very odd about
that... assuming you're not exporting /dev through Samba I would guess
this is a preemption bug.
Could you please send me a) your System.map and b) your kernel
configuration?
Could you also try disabling preemption and see if that helps?
