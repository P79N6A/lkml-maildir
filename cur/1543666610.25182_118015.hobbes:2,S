that ipv6 stuff crept in there (due to a bad merge on my part).  i believe
i have that right now.

fairly certain.  the only dangerous thing proc.c is snprintf().  i didnt
want to spend a lot of time on proc.c doing it the 'right' way (using
atm_dev_hold/release) since it will be change to a seq interface.

i dont know.  i believe all of the adapters do a synchronous close.  after
the close finishes, no more traffic should arrive for a particular vcc.
the bottom halfs (halves?) should not have references to vcc after a close()
for it finishes.

atm_dev_deregister() does that.  if a driver need to remove the atm
device (i suppose its being unplugged) it could close the vcc's and 
call atm_dev_register() which will wait the ref count to drop to 0.
