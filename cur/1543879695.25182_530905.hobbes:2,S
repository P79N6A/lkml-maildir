So this doesn't change process_input_packet(), which treats the case
where the first byte is 0xff (PPP_ALLSTATIONS) but the second byte is
0x03 (PPP_UI) as indicating a packet with a PPP protocol number of
0xff.  Arguably that's wrong since PPP protocol 0xff is reserved, and
the RFC does envision the possibility of receiving frames where the
control field has values other than 0x03.
Therefore I think this patch is probably better.  Could people try it
out and let me know if it fixes the problem?
Paul.
