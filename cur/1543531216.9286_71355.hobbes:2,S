Probing in slot order has the advantage of being an ordering which is
known and obvious to the user.  It is counter intuitive to have cards in
slots 1, 2, 3 get attached to drivers in the order 3, 1, 2, for example.
Further, several kernel subsystems have their own command line options
to allow the user to specify an arbitrary order.  It might be useful to
replace or supplement that with slot-based ordering.
