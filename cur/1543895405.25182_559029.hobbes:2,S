Rationale for both: This was already a (IMHO) rather huge patch for such
a bugfix so I didn't want to change even more code for the sake of
cleanup. I had planned to send a second patch for 2.6.23 that would do
the clean up, should have mentioned that (or included the second patch).
Will resend the patch later today, together with the cleanup patch.
Whoever applies it can then decide if the cleanup should go into 2.6.22
or 2.6.23.
Thanks,
Björn
