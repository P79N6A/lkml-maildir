Just maybe people would like to know if there is a secret OS on the tail
of their drive, or the potential for one being there.
Go research EDDS BEER PARTIES and you will find out this is not a joke.
If the noise pisses you off turn down your kernel printk noise makers.
Better yet stub it out in your own kernel.
Do not remove items that have meaning or valid tests.
Erik, get over it and just live with a stub out.
Cheers,
