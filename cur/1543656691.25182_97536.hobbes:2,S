Heh, if anyone has kept an open mind around here, it's Pat.  Look at the
crap that the driver writers have forced him to accommodate.  Here's a
small drawing that some people did at OLS 2002 to help get across how
all of the wide range of busses, classes, devices, and drivers interact
with just one kind of subsystem:

The existing code handles monstrosities like that quite well, because he
has kept an open mind, and listened to the driver and subsystem authors.
And yes, we need to start writing more class support, it's next on my
list too.  Patches to do this would be greatly appreciated.
