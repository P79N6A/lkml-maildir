Subject: [PATCH 05/14] readahead: thrashing recovery method: refill holes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/16/73

When thrashing happened in the following abnormal cases:
	1) the old chunk is lost;
	2) random pages are lost due to unbalanced aging.
There will be hole(s) in the otherwise continuous readahead pages.
We recover from it by simply refilling all possible holes and
turning off lookahead.
These kind of abnormal situations are not expected to repeatable for the same
stream. They happen in a random fashion and do not tell much about the system
load. So the best thing we can do is to do nothing more than refilling the
holes.  If thrashing persists, it will quickly fail into the 3) case where we
get the exact thrashing threshold:
	3) the new chunk is thrashed.
