100% agreed. Many (I mean MANY) posters add a "PS: please CC me as I'm
not subscribed" line. This means whe might lose their reports while they're
often the most important ones.
Another problem is that many of us post from multiple addresses (work, home,
kernel.org, ...), and this must be taken into account to. Next, some spammers
use *valid* posters addresses, so those will pass through your filters anyway.
I'm already getting several spams a day pretending to emerge from several
LKML posters, so spamlists are also built from large mailing lists.

We already have this large moderators group : all the users. I really
don't mind getting that small rate of spams in my LKML folder. Those
are very easy to identify at first glance, it will be harder when they
will begin with [PATCH] or things like this. You need 15 seconds to
hit the "D" key to remove 30 of them, that's OK.

Your description is generally interesting, but would require a lot of
work, and I'm not sure you'll find many kind people as you who would
devote a great part of their time to moderate such a list.
