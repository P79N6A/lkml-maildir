Well, I don't quite understand. Doesn't bitmap_find_free_region() _have_ 
to return an error if the request cannot be satisfied? Isn't it what it 
does if after scanning the bitmap no suitable free region is found? What's 
the difference? Why don't we want to fix _that_ function? It also has 
other users - currently I see 3 of them in the kernel:
mm/vmalloc.c
arch/powerpc/sysdev/msi_bitmap.c (5 occurrences)
arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh4/sq.c
are we sure that they all are safe wrt to this problem?
Yes, I understand that the caller _can_ verify whether the requested 
region at all fits into the bitmap, but from the PoV of offering a 
consistent API this seems strange.
Thanks
