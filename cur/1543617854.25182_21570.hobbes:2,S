The vservers (see my sig) are pretty good to solve that. You can run any linux i386
distro and version all at once on the same box.

I solved this in virtualfs (
http://www.solucorp.qc.ca/virtualfs
) by introducing
new weak symbol.

Yes but the reverse is true. With the trap, you end up in your own code
with full privilege. Does it opens worst problem.
For privilege stuff, the virtualfs dispatcher connects to special server. Using
unix domain socket, credential passing and file handle passing, you can do
a lot of privileged stuff this way.
