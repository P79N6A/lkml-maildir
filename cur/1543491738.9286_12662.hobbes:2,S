Hi
I was able to compile your fs-type and loading the module. But mount
fails with "mount: fs type rawfs not supported by kernel".
Must there be an option in "make menuconfig" for rawfs to get kernel
support? Or must it be applied to the kernelsource tree?
I had a look at your diff-file and compared ksyms.c - no difference.
What have I done wrong?
Dietmar
