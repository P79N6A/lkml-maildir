for that matter, it's not getting to where it makes sense to have wildly 
different storage on a machine
10's of GB of SSD for super-fast read-mostly
100's of GB of high-speed SCSI for fast writes
TB's of SATA for high capacity
does it make sense to consider tracking the dirty pages per-destination so 
that in addition to only having one process writing to the drive at a time 
you can also allow for different amounts of data to be queued per device?
on a machine with 10's of GB of ram it becomes possible to hit the point 
where at one point you could have the entire SSD worth of data queued up 
to write, and at another point have the same total amount of data queued 
for the SATA storage and it's a fraction of a percent of the size of the 
storage.
