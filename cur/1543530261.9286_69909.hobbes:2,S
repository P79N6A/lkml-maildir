Overcommitting memory is not the problem I have in mind here.

You can still run out of memory, with or without COW, overcommit etc. I
think we are talking at cross purposes here: By running out of memory, I
mean there isn't any free memory to give to apps requesting it (via
malloc() etc.)
If Netscape blows up and grabs all my memory, other applications can't get
any - so I have problems. I need Netscape to be killed to fix the problem
- and I can't log in to do it manually. THIS is the OOM situation I am
thinking of, not a kernel-level problem of being unable to handle a page
fault.
