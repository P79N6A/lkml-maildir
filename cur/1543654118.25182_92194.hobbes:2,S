You can probably use any of the GUI frontends to gdb. I've used DDD in the

This is on a remote computer using kgdb to debug on a remote linux box via
serial port.
Since the local box contains the kernel source, I have my doubts about using
cygwin as one computer, but I guess it MAY be possible, if you know how to
cross compile.
