Hi Len,
Here are 2 patches to fix a couple bugs with the bay driver.  The first
addresses the problem that jikos reported with the bay driver failing
at load due to BUG: at lib/kref.c:32 kref_get().  Since the bay driver
is also a platform driver, I found that when it is compiled into the 
kernel (built in) there is a problem with it being simultaneously an
acpi driver as well as a platform driver.  Since it wasn't really useful
for the bay driver to be an acpi driver, I removed that code.  The second
patch addresses the build issue with bay when dock is not built by making
the bay driver depend on the dock driver.  
Thanks,
Kristen
