Subject: [PATCH] Export symbol from I2C eeprom driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Trivial patch to export a symbol from the eeprom driver. Currently
there are no exported symbols. The symbol lets the radeon DRM driver
link to it and modprobe will then force it to load along with the
radeon driver.
