Hello again
Ive tried some advices you gave me, use hda=remap at boottime, puting
this options CONFIG_PARTITIO_ADVANCED=y and CONFIG_LDM_PARTITION=y,
taking out initrd suport. But I havnt had any improovment.
But I am starting to thing it is about how my HD is managed.
I have a SEGATE 20Gb drive. My BIOS does not recognize that amount of
disk, so I use a program that is on MBR provided by Segate that makes
the 20Gb abiavle. In kernel 2.4 it works just fine, but maybe that is
the cause 2.6 can not boot... am I right? what else could I try?
