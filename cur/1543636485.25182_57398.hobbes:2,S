You solve a problem and introduce a potentially more serious one.
Strict overcommit is requisite but not satisfactory.

This is what I would do first [make sure you don't hit any resource,
malloc, kernel memory mapping, etc limits -- this is a simulation that
must eat all available memory continually]:
main(){void *x;while(1)if(x=malloc(4096))memset(x,666,4096);}
When the above used up all the memory try to ssh/login to the box as
root and clean up the mess. Can you do it?
