Got removed.  Block2mtd is the new one and works with logfs.  At least
my version of it does and I pushed my patches to David - not sure if
they made it to mainline already.  Mtdram should work as well.

It is and changing this wouldn't be too hard.  All device access goes
through five functions (read, write, erase, is_bad and mark_bad).  As
soon as someone seriously cares I will add a struct logfs_device_ops and
have a second set of these functions for block devices.
On hard disks it shouldn't make too much sense.  The filesystem will
fragment like a splinter bomb and be just as popular.

My plan was to move this code to lib/ sooner or later.  If you consider
it useful in its current state, I can do it immediatly.  And if someone
else merged a superior btree library I'd happily remove mine and use the
new one instead.
Opinions?

That's what I tried first.  But the brick I carry on my neck decided to
compile and link the read logfs_fsck() unconditionally and so this
collided.
Will change the Makefile and this.

No more than EXT2_SB() or EXT2_I().
Since you are the second person to ask, I sense a majority vote to
change the case.

Yes and no.  The zlib workspaces weigh about 300k.  On any decent SMP
machine, that hardly matters and getting the scalability is nice.  For
low-end embedded, that amount of memory per filesystem can matter.
I have no clue how many people would suffer one way or another.

I do.  Looks like I should use them here and in at least one other
place.  Will recheck them all.

As should be all oder struct foo_ops.  Will do.

Interesting.  I'll have a look at this.

There is an explanation in the top 30 lines of the file.  Should I add a
reference here?

Inodes are stored in an inode file.  The inode file's inode (master
inode) caused me a bit of headache.  It needs to be released as the very
last, so that any regular inodes can still use it for writeback.
Doing so would gave the user an unpleasant message:
		if (invalidate_inodes(sb)) {
			printk("VFS: Busy inodes after unmount of %s. "
			   "Self-destruct in 5 seconds.  Have a nice day...\n",
			   sb->s_id);
		}
This function mainly exists to smuggle the master inode around this
check.  I didn't know any better way to deal with the problem.
Add this as comment or is there a better strategy I should persue?

Would this help.  Looks like the function does a division and adds any
remainder to tsp.tv_sec.  But any value for tsp.tv_nsec >= NSEC_PER_SEC
is caused by either a bug or data corruption.
If the goal is to prevent illegal values, I could do something cheaper
like:
	if (tsp.tv_nsec >= NSEC_PER_SEC)
		tsp.tv_nsec = 0;
> Should use >= NSEC_PER_SEC here.
Will do.

Neat!  Will do.

No worries!  Thank you a lot for what you've found.  It seems to include
some bugs.
