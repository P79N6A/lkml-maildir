Hi !
I have a little question about creating linux threads inside the process
init.
Is there some limitation in the clone() function when the parent id is 1?
I was trying the 'pthread_create()' call in the init process code but it
nevers returns.
The same code in a child process, in the same module after the fork(), runs
ok.
I used the linux kernel v2.4.19-pre8.
Could you CC the answer/comments to my personnal email, please?
Thanks for your comments,
Jorge Fernandez
