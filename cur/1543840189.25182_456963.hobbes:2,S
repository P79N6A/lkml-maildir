It would be great if the arcmsr driver could be included in 2.6.18 so it
can make into all the new distro releases that will be happening the
last 3-4 months of the year.
It is completely self contained and it isn't changing any existing code
(ergo it can't break anything) so I believe there is quite a bit of
precedence for "late" inclusion in 2.6.18?
There are lots of users of this hardware (myself included) that would be
very appreciative.
