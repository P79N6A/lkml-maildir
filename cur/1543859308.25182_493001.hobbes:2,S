  all right, i may have misread what's going on with
kmem_cache_alloc() and kmem_cache_zalloc(), and my earlier submission
may be entirely nonsense, since it involved transformations like this:
         * it with privilege level 3 because the IVE uses non-privileged accesses to these
         * tables.  IA-32 segmentation is used to protect against IA-32 accesses to them.
         */
-       vma = kmem_cache_alloc(vm_area_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
+       vma = kmem_cache_zalloc(vm_area_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
        if (vma) {
-               memset(vma, 0, sizeof(*vma));
                vma->vm_mm = current->mm;
                vma->vm_start = IA32_GDT_OFFSET;
                vma->vm_end = vma->vm_start + PAGE_SIZE;
can someone briefly tell me if what i did makes sense?
