Sorry to send it again.  I missed one information which might be important.
During the fdisk partition process, p (primary partition) is selected
instead of e (extended).  Also this is secondary disk and not going to be
used for boot.  My boot drive is IDE.
Folks,
Thanks for many warm hands on helping my problem.  Special thanks to Daniel,
Dave and Douglas.
I used fdisk and was able to make two partitions. One from cyliner 3 to 4003
(4GB) and another from 4004 to 8683 (4.6GB).  Then I used "w" option to
write table to disk and exit.  It looks OK.  However, after reboot system,
the partition table is gone.  I have to re-do the process again.
I must missing something here. 
I am using RedHat 6.0 (Linux 2.2.5) and my driver is loaded through command
"insmod hpfc" where "hpfc" is my driver name.  Need advice there again.
Thanks!
