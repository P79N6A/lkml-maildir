To whomever maintains sysklogd:
In sysklogd-1.3-31/syslogd.c. line 1016, is the following construct,
rewritten here to show the problem:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/select.h>
main()
{
   int nfds;
   fd_set unixm;
   for (nfds = 0; nfds < FD_SETSIZE; nfds++)
   {
       fprintf(stderr, "%d\n", nfds);
       if(FD_ISSET(nfds, &unixm))
           printf(".");
   }
   return 0;
}
This will segfault after nfds > 576. On this system, FD_SETSIZE is
the default of 1024. I believe that the limit should have been
FD_SETSIZE/NFDBITS but I am not sure what the designer's intentions
were, like why this information was copied in the first place.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
