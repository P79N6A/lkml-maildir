The oprofile for the 01 kernel says
CPU: P4 / Xeon, speed 1497.76 MHz (estimated)
while the 02 kernel says
CPU: P4 / Xeon with 2 hyper-threads, speed 1497.57 MHz (estimated)
What's going on there?
Other than that, nothing in the kernel profile jumps out at me:
schedule, __copy_from_user_ll and __copy_to_user_ll are all
significantly lower *after* the CPU scheduler changes, which
is an indicator that cache behaviour is better.
Sar says average context switches/second were 9064 and  6567 before
and after.
The only thing I can see is the CPU utilisation averages show the
scheduler patches have more of a tendancy to load up one CPU more
before moving to another. This actually should be good behaviour,
generally but I wonder if it is hurting at all. I would be really
surprised if it was that significant.
