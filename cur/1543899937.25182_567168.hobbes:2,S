I am relatively new to linux device development. And want to understand
Linux conventions.
Suppose I have a PCI card that is represented in the system by a
character device.
If I have two of those PCI cards in the system when the driver module
loads, is it convention to have two different major numbers, or have one
major number and two different minor numbers?
Thanks,
Jon
