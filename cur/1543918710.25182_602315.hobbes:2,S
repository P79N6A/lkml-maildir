I've seen this issue (to a much lessor extent) on 2.6.17 as well.
So if earlier kernels had the regular spin_lock() there (rather than trylock)
then this is still *an* issue, but not *the* issue.  And in my specific
case (only 2 CPUs), the trylock cannot be the problem here.
But with more cores it definitely could be an issue.

I suspect this one more, as there really are not many other possibilities.
One thing to try might be to just have the power_off() code do msleep(1000)
before the ACPI poweroff call.  That would give enough time for the other
core to "halt", and is easy enough to try for diagnosis purposes.
I'm off rock climbing for a week or so, but if you cook something up
in the meanwhile then I'll test it on return.
