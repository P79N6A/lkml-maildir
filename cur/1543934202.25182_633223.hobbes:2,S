Subject: [PATCH] net/x25: Add missing x25_neigh_put
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Julia Lawall <julia@diku.dk>
The function x25_get_neigh increments a reference count.  At the point of
the second goto out, the result of calling x25_get_neigh is only stored in
a local variable, and thus no one outside the function will be able to
decrease the reference count.  Thus, x25_neigh_put should be called before
the return in this case.
The problem was found using the following semantic match.
