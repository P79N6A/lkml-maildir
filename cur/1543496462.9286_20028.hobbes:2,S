It just occured to me after my first message on this, that it
might be entirely possible to implement the entire idea
completely in userspace.
Open each serial port on the server, and then connect the two
together via software.  I'm concerned with latency, and other
types of delay problems too though, so any advice would be
greatly appreciated.
Any pointers to some Linux serial programming documentation would
be also appreciated.
Thanks in advance.
