Dear.
I have considered myself as a rather unofficial maintainer of this code,
and wouldn't mind make it official now when I actually have a job which
both cares about and actually can support my upstream Linux activities,
which was a major pain for a while.
Overall, there is a lot of cleanup which really is needed in the i386
boot process; I have done some work on it already, but more is needed.
