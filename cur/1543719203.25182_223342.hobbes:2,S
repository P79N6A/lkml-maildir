I'm reviewing these now.
I am worried though -- the first couple patches include a TON of 
whitespace changes and cleanups unrelated to the patch at hand.  This 
makes it MUCH more difficult to review each patch.
I'm considering rejecting the entire series because of this obfuscation 
of changes, and getting you to resend with the whitespace crapola 
separated out.
