No. But I guess it is not allocated. It would be stupid to allocate it.
"du" agrees with me that no block is allocated :)

Yes. I tried touch and du reports file takes zero bytes.

There is no such problem in reiserfs and also so were requirements of those
people.
Anyway as I said, I had problem creating ext3 filesystem that can hold this
many inodes just because I had not big enough block device.

They are stored in tree.

One superblock.

Bitmap locations are indeed static and allocated at mkfs time (and at resize
time if you happen to grow the volume after creating)
This is not fast at all. And also we load those bitmaps at mount time,
this leads to a lot of complains about "reiserfs mounts large volumes slowly".
