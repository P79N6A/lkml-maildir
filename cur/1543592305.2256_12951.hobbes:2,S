Hi all,
Please excuse me if my doubt is silly but do help me in answering this.
I compiled the ramfilesystem under fs/ramfs and got the object file
inode.o.
1.Should I do insmod to insert this module. 
2.After inserting this module how can I use "mkfs" to make this file
system befor mounting it.
Please help with the answers as I am highly confused.
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
sathish.j
