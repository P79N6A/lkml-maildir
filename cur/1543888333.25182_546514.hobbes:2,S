Then again, IPv6 in < 2.6.can't remember, but .8 is one of them
_was_ pretty awful. I think it started being okish around .14 or .15?
If you feel like spending lots of time, you could try to shoehorn net/*
from the latest rhel4/centos4 kernel (2.6.9-based) into your router, someone
might have spent the effort fixing the relevant bugs in that tree (but maybe
not, until the 4.5 kernel it used to spew Badness in dst_release at
include/net/dst.h:149 every few seconds if your box was on a ipv6 network :D
)
Personally, I'd get a new router without binary blobs, value of time spent
doing the shoehorning > price of new router, I'm sure, but you may value
your free time differently :)
I do know sixxs ipv6 tunnels are rock solid with openwrt (2.4-based) ;)
