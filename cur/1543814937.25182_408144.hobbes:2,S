I did not try it, but because of the code and the outputs I got when I tried
to find the problem I'm sure it would work.

I don't see how that setting could change the device ID or the vendor ID. As
I understood the above code will simply not try to enable the sound device
if:
a) the vendor is not ASUSTEK
b) the device is not ID is not PCI_DEVICE_ID_VIA_8237
For a) it means that an MSI/Epox/whatever board with the same VIA chipset
and the same problem will not be handled. For b) see my previous comment
(and your concerns).
Well, it would be nice if a kernel developer could comment on it, or simply
include the right version in some upcoming release. ;-)
