Actually, you need more than PF-key v2. v2 does not handle policy and
IPSEC must, so extensions are required. Currently, FreeS/WAN, KAME and
Open BSD each have their own slightly different extensions.

I think it was actually done, for an older version of FreeS/WAN. There's
link in the WWWref.html doc file to a site in Scandinavia with the code.
What would, I think, be far more interesting would be a port of the BSD
photurisd(8).  Since Linux ipsec_pluto(8) and BSD isakmpd(8) both
implement the same protocol, IKE, the payoff for a port in either
direction is not huge. Photuris, though, is a different protocol for
the same function, and a much cleaner design, so that would be a win.
