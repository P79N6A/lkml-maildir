Hello,
I have a need to run thousands of IP addresses on one host.  (It's
running apache.)
Unfortunately, when I configure the host for more than about
2000 ip aliases, the machine starts to bog down.  At about 3000
aliases, the system spends about 50 percent of the time in
the kernel.  Since the alias hash table only holds 256 entries,
I surmise that the kernel is spending its time looking to
see if it should answer the IP addresses.
What I'm considering:  somehow, making a single ip alias
interface serve an entire class C network when a special
interface flag is set.  Has anyone worked with something like that?
It seems this would only work for TCP.  I'd also have to ensure
that the getsockname() address came from the IP address in
the SYN packet itself, not the interface address.  If someone
could point me in the right direction, I'd greatly appreciate
it.
It occurs to me that I could be creating a lot of work for
nothing, as it appears the loopback interface already exhibits the required
behavior.  On interface serves 127.0.0.0/8.  Can this be done
with extra loopback interfaces?
Thanks for any info.
