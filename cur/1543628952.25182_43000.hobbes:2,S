Can I do this with a DOS bootdisk? I remember that most of the Flash updates 
require you to startup the computer in a real DOS environment, at least those 
I have seen for my ASUS P5A and A7V boards.
Windows XP didn't live long on my system - I just booted it after I bought 
that thingy, then I installed Linux on the whole disk. I can live with the 
reboot problem, as long as I'd have to install XP or some other Microsoft 
shit on it to fix it.

I'll try. Is anyone interested in getting positive feedback? You?

That's right. With APM, I had the problem that the fan didn't turn on if it 
wasn't on after a power-on. Twice, my machine went off because it overheated.

I'll try that, too.

Umm, I really forgot that. I am currently using a vanilla 2.5.9 kernel and I 
am quite happy with it.
Thanks,
