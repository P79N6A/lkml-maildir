Hello all,
	Just upgraded to 2.3.51 earlier today.  In the course of plugging
in a suggestion from Linus concerning shmget errors (mounting shm file
system DID fix that problem) I noticed a rather strange anomoly.  File
systems which use to NOT show up with "df" now do show up with wierd numbers.

	Before (2.3.50 and earlier) this would never have shown the "none"
entries or the "automount" entries.
	BTW...  Is it just me or does it seem like we've recently aquired
a lot of new "none" type file systems (pts, usbfs, devfs, shm, etc)?  I
know proc and pts have been around for a while, it just seems like I've
had to add a bunch of new ones to fstab in the last couple of months.  Is
this a new paradgm to add special purpose file systems?
	Mike
