"static tracepoints" does not equate directly to "all of LTT". I'm not
saying we should accept LTT as-is. I'm saying we should not reject the
concept of static tracepoints.

If people are *using* them, it's no easier to maintain them outside of
tree, than in-tree. it's significantly harder.

Your argument about schedstats only seems to illustrate the flaws in the
arguments for dynamic tracepointing - you've put your finger on exactly
what the problem is, when the code changes, the tracing HAS to change
too. The best time to do this is when the code itself changes.
It's the same arguement for putting documentation in the C file against
the source itself.

If you're talking about the scriptable awk-like "stuff" that comes with
Systemtap, yes I agree it should not be in the C code, it's foul.
However, I don't think a simple macro hooks are a burden.

How can you possibly say that maintaining the same set of data in two
dis-coupled trees is easier than doing it in the same place? You don't
require any *less* information to do it with systemtap than you do with
some form of static tracing.
If you're talking about the effort of maintaining just what's in the
kernel tree, then of course it's a little easier, but that's only half
the equation. And I don't think it's much of a burden, frankly. Yes,
if we have 2 billion tracepoints, it'll be a pain in the arse, but the
taste of the subsystem maintainers is what would regulate this, along
with everything else that we do. They'll accept a few important ones,
and reject the rest. If it's not valuable in general, they won't take
it. I don't see what the big problem is.
What *is* a problem is having a two separate mechanisms for doing
dynamic and static tracing. They should share the same logging 
facilities and readback mechanisms so we can read both types
consistently from userspace, and the data is correctly interspersed.
