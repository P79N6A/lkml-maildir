Hi,
I've been trying to compile 2.5 kernels in my all SCSI machine, however 
failing miserably. It compiles but gives me a nasty oops upon reboot. 
Since I've not had such show stopper with any 2.4 kernel, I tried to 
compile an early 2.5, eg. 2.5.1-pre1 (not avoid 2.5.0 to avoid umount 
breakage) and it compiled, as one would expect. However, I start to get 
oopses right from 2.5.1-pre2 onwards. I tried up to 2.5.3-final and the 
same result is obtained.
Upon boot, I see it oopses when detecting SCSI devices (namely the two 
hard drives) related to the aic7xxx driver. This doesn't surprise me at 
all knowing that since 2.5.1-pre2 I get compile warnings precisely with 
this driver. Here's the stderr from the 'make bzImage' process:
In file included from aic7xxx_linux.c:122:

I'm not sure how can I dump the oops output here but if it is really 
needed, I'll try to provide you with it. My .config is goes attached. 
This is a Pentium-Classic 100MHz, 32MB RAM.
I don't know if someone arose this problem before. If so, my apologies. 
I don't know if this is somehow connected with the oopses but it's just 
too much coincidence. Sorry if I'm talking nonsense here, but what you 
see here is well...a newbie :|
Thanks in advance,
