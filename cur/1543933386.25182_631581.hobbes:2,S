Linus vetoed going to a larger soft page size, with good reason.
Just look at how much the 64kB page size on PPC64 sucks for most
workloads - it works for PPC64 because people buy PPC64 monster
systems for the kinds of monster workloads that work well with a
large page size, but it definately isn't general purpose.
