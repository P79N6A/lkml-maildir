I like how simple it appears to be :)
At first I missed the fact that owning uid is always 0 so I thought the
uid processing wasn't quite enough.  But since it's always 0, the only
question is whether there are any /proc/sys files whose users currently
depend on being setgid 0 and setgid non-0 with no capabilities.
On my laptop, 'find /proc/sys -type f -perm -020' gives me no results,
so that is promising.
So this certainly seems like a good first step.  In fact, combined with
/proc/sys/ being partially remounted per container like /proc/sys/net is
doing, we may not even need to do anything with CAP_NS_OVERRIDE.
