My ISP uses Solaris boxes for mail service and so on. I had to unsubscribe
of LKML from that address due to ENC. The damned solaris box trashed
ECN enabled packets so vger could not reach it. Now I am subscribed
from an IRIX box and it works.
The admin of the Solaris boxes told me he was talking with Sun... that
was months ago.
Anybody knows if Sun firewall soft is already ECN aware ?
Thanks.
