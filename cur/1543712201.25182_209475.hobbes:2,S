You need such an .inf file on the windows side; M$ has a template where
you simply need to insert your vendor/device ID and other stuff. I'm not
sure about the license for these files, so I don't know if it is allowed
to distribute them.

Until now DEV_CONFIG_CLASS was 0xFF, which results in Windows getting
hickup. If you directly set this to 0x02 (Network Device) Win is happy.
Might be a good idea anyway.
