I talked with Al about this off list a bit, and pointed out it's
different than it appears.  GEN_RTC really is a mostly-generic RTC
driver.  There's some fakey stuff going on for UIE (all under
GEN_RTC_X), but the real meat of the driver is common export get/set
time and per-arch (which can abstract further, see ppc32) poke the
hardware for the time. There's 2 (afaik) problems, one being a lack of
alarm support, and the other being hardware access isn't (today)
abstracted out far enough for i2c stuff to work.
Russell King has both of these fixed in the ARM-specific but hardware
poking abstracted rtc driver.  I'd like to try and merge things at
somepoint...
