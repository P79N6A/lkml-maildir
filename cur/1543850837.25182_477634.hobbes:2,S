Hi Ulrich,
I'm fairly certain the patch is safe, even for non-US regulatory domains.
Looking at the zd1211rw code the highest channel in the geo object
would appear to be set in zd_geo_init as determined by
zd_channel_range which just does a simple look up in channel_ranges[],
so if this code behaves correctly [and there is no indication it does
not], then setting the upper channel to be that in the geo object
would appear to be safe for any of the supported regulatory domains.
Cheers,
Holden :-)
