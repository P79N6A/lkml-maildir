   I have been playing with the rocket port driver in 2.4 trying to make 
   it work. It appears that the driver hasn't been modified in some time,
   as it did not work at all on the debian potato inbstall of 2.2.17, nor
   did it work under a fresh 2.4.0-test6 compile. 
Yeah, I need to get the latest Rocketport driver updated for 2.4.  I
think I have it working for 2.4 and devfs; I'd appreciate it if you
could test it for me.  You can get the driver at:
	
http://rocketport.sourceforge.net
Most of the users of the driver are still using Linux 2.2 (and they
usually get the driver from the manufacturer when they buy the card), so
the main maintenance happenss outside the kernel.  It's about time to
get an update folded into the Linux 2.2 and 2.4 trees, though.
   here is the diff against a 2.4.0-test6 kernel

For future reference, use the -u flag to diff to create unified diffs.
They contain a lot more context and are much more useful when sending
patches to authors.
