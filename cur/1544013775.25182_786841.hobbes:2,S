I'm not sure if this is good idea.
Either pci config space needs to be restored early, or it can wait.
Sometimes restoring it early and sometimes restoring it late seems
harmful: it will make code harder to understand and harder to test.

If drivers have to assume it is restored late, anyway... why not do it
late, always?
