Since you asked, for the record I am the maintainer of
http://www.buraphalinux.org/download/bls1.1/
 which is a small-time
compiled-from-source distribution (except java and ant).  It is used
at the university where I teach, and for some government sites in
Bangkok.  My distribution uses vanilla kernels, vanilla gcc, vanilla
libc, etc.  I apply patches for path differences, CVEs, and for trying
to get old stuff to build with newer gcc, but otherwise I don't patch
things.  Of the known distributions, we are most similar to Slackware.
 I did try everything I knew before bothering the list with this.  I
am testing a beta of my next release that is the first with
capabilites enabled, and hit this problem with 'at' after updating a
test machine from 2.6.23.16 to the 2.6.24.2 kernel.
I will test the new version of the patch when I see it on the list and
report back what happens.
Thank you for your help.
