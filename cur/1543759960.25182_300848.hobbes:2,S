yes. Some people (like me) would like to use from time to time
 some _new_ stable kernel. It's annoying to see that sometimes
kernel people say that you have a hardware problem in 2.6.0 
release and then the bug is silently fixed in a 2.6.5 release
for example. 
The 2.6 kernel is not good enough for desktop -- sound skips on 
a 700Mhz duron when there is a lot (50M of 256) of free memory 
and mozilla is using CPU. 2.4 with preemptible patches was 
better in that respect.
What i would like to really have is a stable version not a demo
version. I like testing but sometimes i also want stability and
it seems that a good enough 2.6 kernel is still away. 
I don't care how you call it 2.6.x.y.z-rc-kappa i just want to 
be sure that it will not mess up my system. 
(and no, i'm not going to use <insert your favourite distro>
kernel )
 
Just my 2 euro cents (if somebody cares)
P.S. I know this message is late. Sorry if it annoys you.
