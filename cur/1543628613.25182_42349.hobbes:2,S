Actually, I dont get that.
Why SHOULD I download ten different architectures when I only want two (ARM
and X86).?
Why SHOULD I download SCSI when I dont use anything but IDE? (cost reasons)
Why SHOULD I download bluetooth stuff when I will probably wont own a
bluetooth device in the near future?
Why dont you try to provide a satisfactory answer to those questions
instead of avoiding them and turning them around?
Here is my answer for the record:
I shouldnt. its a pointless waste of bandwidth.
Now, whats YOUR answer?
Especially in light of the 2.5 kernel becomming ever more modular.
