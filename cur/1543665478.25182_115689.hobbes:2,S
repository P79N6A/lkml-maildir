It does matter how the initramfs is built.  /bin/sh may or may not be 
necessary (but klibc /bin/sh is just over 50K on i386 -- 55K static, 
whereas glibcx /bin/bash is 600K plus the glibc binary), but one of the 
goals with initramfs is to at least make it feasible to give someone who 
comes and asks "I have a weird-ass site with 20000 hosts and we need X" 
a better answer then "well, go hack the kernel."
/sbin/kinit is a feasible way to do it, but it's important to keep the 
flexibility option open.

Agreed (although it's harder than you think to move code from the kernel 
into it -- frequently it has been easier to just write code from 
scratch; it's cleaner that way, too.)
The reason I wanted to use BSD/MIT license only really applies to the 
library.
