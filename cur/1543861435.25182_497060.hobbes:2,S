Looks generally good to me, but..

Please always put prototypes for functions with external linkage in
header files.

No need for the cast here.
Btw, in case you have some spare time there are some other syscalls
that want similar treatment.  sendfile(64) come to mind as these
could use a do_sendfile helper aswell, the various stat and readdir/getdents
variants could do with some unification, the various timing calls
like alarm and get/settimeofday are common across architectures,
sysctl should be the same everywhere, the uid/git related syscalls
should be consolidated, sched_rr_get_interval looks trivial,
and last but not least we probably want a unified mechanisms to deal
with the 64bit arguments that are broken up into two 32bit ones (not just
for emulation but also for 32it BE architectures)
Okay, okay - we should probably put this into a Wiki somewhere :)
