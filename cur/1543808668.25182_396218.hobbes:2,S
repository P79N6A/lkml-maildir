Both of you are missing an important difference between Suspend-to-RAM and 
Suspend-to-Disk.
Suspend-to-RAM is a true suspend operation, in that the hardware's state
is maintained _in the hardware_.  External buses like USB will retain
suspend power, for instance (assuming the motherboard supports it; some
don't).
Suspend-to-Disk, by contrast, is _not_ a true suspend.  It can more 
accurately be described as checkpoint-and-turn-off.  Hardware state is not 
maintained.  (Some systems may support a special ACPI state that does 
maintain suspend power to external buses during shutdown, I forget what 
it's called.  And I down't know whether swsusp uses this state.)
So for example, let's say you have a filesystem mounted on a USB flash or
disk drive.  With Suspend-to-RAM, there's a very good chance that the
connection and filesystem will still be intact when you resume.  With
Suspend-to-Disk, the USB connection will terminate when the computer shuts
down.  When you resume, the device will be gone and your filesystem will
be screwed.
