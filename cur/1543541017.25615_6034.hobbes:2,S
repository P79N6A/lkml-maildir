Lately, I've seen a couple of people write "I've sent this patch to
Linus", where the patch in question hasn't been peer-reviewed and has
bugs in it that show it hasn't been tested enough (or at all).
In my work process, submitting to Linus is a significant event.  When I
submit something to Linus, I indicate how I tested it and the names
of other people (if any) who have proof-read or tested it.  I would be
embarrassed to say "here's a big patch but I've never run it and I can't
get anyone to test it".  If I'm in that position, I don't send the patch.
Linus still discards a lot of my patches, but I never have to go back
and say "please disregard previous patch".
Just my humble opinion,
