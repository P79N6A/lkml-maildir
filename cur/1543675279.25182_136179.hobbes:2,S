Thanks a lot for the fixes!

I deliberately surpressed 'redudant' error reports.  When the checker saw
multiple errors caused by the same user pointer in one function, it'll
only report one error for this user pointer in this function.  if I don't
do so, people tend to get bored by the 'repeated' messages, and leave
error reports in other functions uninspected. ;) I'll re-run the checker
soon with the suppression off.
