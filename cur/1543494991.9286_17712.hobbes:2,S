Hmmm. Thanx for the info but I recognized that growing number of network
buffer allocations results more locked memory. At my machine with 64M ram
there is often 50M memory used and I cannot starting after this anything
without a lot of swap area being used. It seems kernel (?) locks a large
amount of memory and I don't know why. Even with killing all tasks except
init can't help ...
