Subject: Kernel includefile bug not fixed after a year :-(
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

A year after I did report this inconsistency, it is still not fixed
If include/scsi/scsi.h is included without __KERNEL__ #defined, then this
error message apears.
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h:172: parse error before "u8"
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h:172: warning: no semicolon at end of struct 
or union
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h:173: warning: data definition has no type or 
storage class
Is there no interest in user applications for kernel features or is there just
no kernel maintainer left over who makes the needed work?
Hints:
-	A type named "u8" is superfluous (even with __KERNEL__ #defined)
	because we have a standard type uint8_t
-	Kernel include files should be checked for use compliance with level 
	compilations on a regular base. It is the duty of the persons who
	make changes to make sure that their changes don't break things.
