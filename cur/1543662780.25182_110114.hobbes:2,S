Dave,
There are a great number of kgdb patches in the wild.  You would help 
us out a lot if you were to name the one you are using.  If you are on 
then 2.5 kernel I suggest you check out Andrew Morton's area and use 
that one.
If you are using the one from source forge on a 2.4 kernel, there is a 
mailing list for it that can be found at the same sourceforge site.
