Looks good, but check with Len Brown. He did relevant ACPI changes.

Okay, looks to me like sd_shutdown should be done from
device_suspend(), not device_shutdown [because it needs scsi subsystem
to be functional]. Also for reboot we probably want PMSG_FREEZE (not
PMSG_SUSPEND), to keep it slightly faster.
