  It modifies a tiny fraction of a percent of the kernel, which is
currently simplistic rather than simple. Nearly everyone who looks at it
makes some improvement, be it preempt, low latency, etc.

  How much slowdown did you measure when you tested the effect of that?

  You have that backward. There are  many people who say they can see a
benefit, and no one has shown either a quantified bad impact or a single
user account which said it was worse. And I bet you looked, didn't you?
  I believe that a system will run better for a single user, and better
for a server with high interrupt rates, like DNS or web servers, where
many threads may be blocked on i/o, but there is significant CPU load as
well.
