Could someone please give me a skeleton char driver  than can be compiled
on RedHat Linux 6.0 and also a MakeFile for it.  It doesnt need to have any
real code in it, just functions that use the inode and file defeinitions
and file_operations
I keep getting errors as the compiler seems to ignore the fs.h file and
says that struct inode and struct file hasn't been defined.
Please help me out, I am an experienced programmer but not on
device-drivers fro Linux. If I just can use the fs.h definitions can I
start the actual work :)
I have a deadline to meet and I haven't began to write any code as I can't
get the skeleton t o compile :)
Thankfull for any help!
Henrik
