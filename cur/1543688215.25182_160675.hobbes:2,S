This problem happened a few month ago and the detailed data does not
remain. Therefore it is difficult to know what is essential cause for
this problem, but, I guessed that pagecache used as I/O cache grew
gradually during system running, and finally it oppressed memory.
Besides this problem, there are many cases where increase of pagecache
causes trouble, I think.
For example, DBMS.
DBMS caches index of DB in their process space.
This index cache conflicts with the pagecache used by other applications,
and index cache may be paged out. It cause uneven response of DBMS.
In this case, limiting pagecache is effective.

I also think that is effective. Empirically, in the case where pagecache
causes memory shortage, most of pagecache is unmapped page. Of course
real problem may not be pagecashe, as you or Mike said.
