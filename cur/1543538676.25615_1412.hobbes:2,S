The almost never reused pages is ok for them to go to swap, they are
good candidates, i.e. candidates to go to swap:
     1- unused pages
     2- almost unused pages

I wast to age all the pages.  That is not an attack, how do you
differentiate a program that touches its pages from that.  It is ok to
do that.
Later, Juan.
