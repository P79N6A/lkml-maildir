Hi(Alex),
What is ip adress assigning schema for teql? what ip adress should be set
on teql and what on slave devices? In other words are some of these
adresses same or must be unique on each device? 
I tried to equalize 2 frame-relay devices both CIR 256k with the same
ip adress on teql fr0 fr1 and then with unique ip adresses on each one.
The result was terrible (16k) in both cases.
Thnx
J.N.
