I think it is just convenient.  If you never use the performance
governor, there is no need to compile it.  I have no need for an init
script that changes the governor on runtime, too.  I just say, use this
and nothing else, ever.  Don't know if this convenience is worth the
trouble, though ;)

It appears a bit hackish.  I would be interested in a cleaner way to
force an earlier call to a module's init function.
