No. This doesn't happen because we make a call to nfs_wb_page
immediately after we've grabbed the page lock in nfs_readpage. This is
what assures write + read serialization for asynchronous writebacks.
(The page lock assures you don't start any new writes).

We want to serialize the case of write + write too. As I said earlier
in this thread, you cannot assume that either of 2 different processes
really have write permission even if the attributes seem to indicate
that they do. Ugly: but that's what a stateless protocol means...
Cheers,
