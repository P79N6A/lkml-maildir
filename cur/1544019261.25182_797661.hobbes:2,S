	This looks almost, but not quite right.
	In the create path, we do configfs_new_dirent() before we set
sd->s_type.  But configfs_new_dirent() attaches sd->s_sibling.  So, in
aonther thread, configfs_depend_prep() can traverse this s_sibling
without CONFIGFS_USET_CREATING being set.  This turns out to be safe
because CONFIGFS_DIR is also not set - but boy I'd like a comment about
that.
	What if we're in mkdir(2) in one thread and another thread is  
trying to pin the parent directory?  That is, we are inside
configfs_mkdir(parent, new_dentry, mode).  The other thread is doing
configfs_depend_item(subsys, parent).  With this patch, the other thread
will not take parent->i_mutex.  It will happily determine that
parent is part of the tree and bump its s_dependent with no locking.  Is
this OK?
	If it is - isn't this patch good without any other reason?  That
is, aside from the issues of lockdep, isn't it better for
configfs_depend_item() to never have to worry about the VFS locks other
than the configfs root?
