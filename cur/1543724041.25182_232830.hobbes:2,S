Indeed fiddly - not only does the packet have to disappear, we need an ICMP
to confirm that. This is because the packet currently disappears anyhow. 
Another thought that ocurred to me is that this might be a window tracking
firewall that says, based on the scaled window size which it misinterprets
because it does not understand window scaling: "I'm not going to let this
packet pass, I've seen that the intended recipient announced a 43 byte
window size".
The idea such a silly firewall would have is that it 'protects' a host from
traffic it can't handle.
This jives with the observed fact that things work up to and including
wscale=2, but breaks with wscale=3. With wscale=3, the scaled window size is
730. With wscale=2, the observed window of 1460 is big enough to let a
packet pass.
We could verify this assumption by checking if lowering the MTU to say 700
allows wscale=3 to work. 
Looking at the traceroute to Alessandro, my current suspect is this machine:
(The 1655 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
PORT    STATE    SERVICE
81/tcp  filtered hosts2-ns
135/tcp filtered msrpc
445/tcp filtered microsoft-ds
514/tcp open     shell
No exact OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see
http://www.insecure.org/cgi-bin/nmap-submit.cgi
).

TCP port 514 is rsh, but when I try rsh on that port it doesn't work.
