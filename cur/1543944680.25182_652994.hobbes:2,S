I don't disagree with that, but the fact is that there isn't such a
tool.   It's also a fact that the enterprise is reasonably unhappy with
the lack of an enclosure management infrastructure, since it's something
they got on all the other unix systems.
I think a minimal infrastructure in-kernel does just about everything
the enterprise wants ... and since it's stateless, they can always use
direct connect tools in addition.
However, I'm happy to be proven wrong ... anyone on this thread is
welcome to come up with a userland enclosure infrastructure.  Once it
does everything the in-kernel one does (which is really about the
minimal possible set), I'll be glad to erase the in-kernel one.
