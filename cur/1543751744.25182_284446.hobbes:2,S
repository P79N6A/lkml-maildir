Thanks a lot for the detective work. You are right, PWM control was
added very recently to the it87 driver in 2.6 (but is there for some
time alredy for 2.4 kernels in the lm_sensors project).
The 0-255 range happens to be in the correct "direction" for at least
one other board () so the it87 driver isn't plain wrong, more likely it
is a matter of how the chip was wired and (mis)configured by the
motherboard manufacturer. In particular, I suspect the fan polarity bit
not to be properly set on your board.
Could you please provide a dump of your it87 chip before loading the
it87 driver? "isadump 0x295 0x296" should tell you. I would also be
interested in a dump right after you load the driver if possible (but
don't burn your CPU for me).
Do you know what kind of it87 chip you do have? There are three of them,
IT8705F, IT8712F and a SIS950 clone (mostly similar to the IT8705F).

Although it works for you, it probably breaks the driver for other
people, so it doesn't look like the correct fix. I'll propose a patch
after I see your chip dumps.
Thanks,
