Right --- 2.5 will have to see a proper API for allowing 64-bit
addressing on PCI buses too, for large memory Intel boxes.  Right now
we force bounce buffers in the ll_rw_block code, but we need a way to
push that down to the driver if a given driver can do PCI64 or DAC
addressing.  I'd rather not touch things now, but wait until we're
ready to do the job properly.

The compiler will usually deal with that by adding the necessary
padding.  You need this even on i386 --- ints get 32-bit aligned even
if preceeded by a char or short type in a struct.
