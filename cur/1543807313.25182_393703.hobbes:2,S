I just wanted to add a "me too". I have a Shuttle ST20G5 with a M5229
rev c7:
00:1f.0 IDE interface: ALi Corporation M5229 IDE (rev c7) (prog-if fa)
        Subsystem: Holco Enterprise Co, Ltd/Shuttle Computer Unknown device f391
        Flags: bus master, 66MHz, medium devsel, latency 32, IRQ 185
        I/O ports at 8880 [size=16]
Reading CD's and DVD's always works, but writing or blanking hangs the
drive, with the following entries in the log files;
ide-cd: cmd 0x3 timed out
hda: lost interrupt
hda: request sense failure: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: request sense failure: error=0x40 { LastFailedSense=0x04 }
hda: lost interrupt
hda: lost interrupt
The "lost interrupt" message is than repeated endlessly until i reboot,
and every program that tries to access the drive (including reading)
will hang for example:
31527 pts/0    D+     0:00 cat /proc/ide/hda/capacity
This is also on a AMD64, so i don't know maybe it is a AMD64 problem
only.
