You need to decide who "owns" these pages.  Once that's decided, it tells
you who should release them.

Pages which the driver owns should be owned by the, umm, driver.  The
driver allocates them, tracks their status, does a put_page() when it's
done with them.  Processes might temporarily take a ref on them, in which
case in rare circustances it's the process who does the final put_page(),
but conceptually the driver is still managing these pages.
If the process "owns" these pages then they get allocated in ->nopage and
they get freed in exit(), munmap(), mremap(), etc.  ->nopage() should not
take a ref on a page if ->nopage() just allocated it (major fault)
(alloc_pages() did that).  If ->nopage finds that the page already exists
(minor fault) then it should take a ref on it.  If the driver needs to
temporarily access these pages then it should do a temporary
get_page()/put_page() to protect itself from a concurrent
munmap()/exit()/etc.
If you have pages which are created by ->nopage() but which are supposed to
be shared across forks (the VMA should use VM_DONTCOPY|VM_SHARED) then each
time a new process starts accessing these already-existing pages it'll take
a minor fault.  Your ->nopage handler should locate the page by some means,
take a ref on it then return it.  do_no_page() will then make the process's
pte map the now-shared page and all is happy.  Once all processes which have
faulted in a page have let go of it again (each pte whcih maps that page
has a ref on it which gets undone in munmap/exit/etc), the page will get
freed.
So...
mmap(): set VM_DONTCOPY on VMA, possibly fail if the caller didn't set
VM_SHARED.
nopage(): if the page exists, take a ref on it.  If it didn't, allocate it.
Return page.
Approximately.  Let's wait for Hugh to come along and clean up my mess.
