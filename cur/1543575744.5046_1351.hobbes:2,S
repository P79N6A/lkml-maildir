Ok, there are two things here:
1) "hdx=flash" _does_ fail, because the flash-related code clobbers hda 
   _after_ hda's detection phase, when it's looking at hdb (which is flash).
2) I can see no situation where hdb detection should ever override the 
   _already_performed_ detection of hda in this way.
Basically, as is, the kernel finds hda (traditional IDE device), configures it 
normally, then finds hdb (flash), and clobbers all the correct info it already 
detected for hda.  This seems just plain wrong.
