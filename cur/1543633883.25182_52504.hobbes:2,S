You're actually asking the wrong question.  "Why is there such a thing as
directcolor" would be a better question.  After all, if there's no "speed
benefit" when why do manufacturers bother implementing it?
Could it be because it allows colours to be dynamically allocated?  Given
a "good enough" allocator which looks over your complete colour usage, you
could probably make better use of the available colours than truecolor
allows.
