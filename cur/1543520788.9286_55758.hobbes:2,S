ASUS SC875 works fine for me on 2.3.35-SMP.  .config extract.
# CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C7xx is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX=y
# CONFIG_SCSI_SYM53C8XX is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS=8
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS=4
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC=20
# CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_PROFILE is not set
# CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_IOMAPPED is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYMBIOS_COMPAT=y
Watch the SYMBIOS_COMPAT option, some cards claim to be Symbios
compatible but are not.  If in doubt, set that option off.
