Linux does not have kernel-level threads, this is true. There is a
'clone()' kernel call which can be used to implement threads in user
space in a library (e.g. libpthreads with glibc2). This threading is as
good as the windows threading in my experience.
Reason for this implementation is that Linux context-switches are very
fast, so it made more sense to keep the context-switching code than
re-write it as a 2 level process model for processes and threads.
