intlat is a tool for measuring how long the kernel spends with
interrupts disabled.
It is similar to the tool which Jun Sun at MontaVista announced a few
days ago.
Salient differences:
- Jun's tool is for 2.2.14.  intlat is for 2.3.99-pre3.
- Jun's tool is for UP.  intlat is SMP-aware.
- Jun's tool is probably more accurate.  I have some constant-time
offsets which I'm not very motivated to tune.
