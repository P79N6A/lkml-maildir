Hmm, I see that as very bad. There should be a bunch of sysctls to do that easily. Also, I heard that 2.4 (and I'm assuming 2.2 as well) swaps pages on a last-used-age basis, instead of either a number-of-times-used or a hybrid of the two. That kinda seems stupid, especially if you get a bunch of apps running that just cycle thru pages, instead of the most used pages staying in memory, and the least used being swapped back and forth with about 2 or 3 megs of memory used to store the least used pages in memory
