commit dd59b8537f6cb53ab863fafad86a5828f1e889a2 upstream
 ASYNC_TX: fix dependency chaining
 In ASYNC_TX we track the dependencies between the descriptors
using the 'next' pointers of the structures. These pointers are
set to NULL as soon as the corresponding descriptor has been
submitted to the channel (in async_tx_run_dependencies()).
 But, the first 'next' in chain still remains set, regardless
the fact, that tx->next is already submitted. This may lead to
multiple submisions of the same descriptor. This patch fixes this.
