Hi,
  In current linux kernel, file descriptors do not include a process data. So 
if it is possible to add process data to file descriptor structures in Linux 
kernel. So a file descriptor could save a list of proc pointers or a list of 
PID values. If this list can be implemented, then sockets can be easily 
identified using protocol control block hash table.
 thanks
