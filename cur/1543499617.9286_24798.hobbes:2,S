   Your changes IMHO in the right direction, but it would be better
to change the resource management code even more:
   o  The resource table needn't be of a constant size. A linked
      list of kmalloc'ed entries fits better.
   o  Locking by cli/sti should be removed. Nobody needs to allocate
      resources from interrupts :)  It's probably enough to define
      that these functions must be called with the big kernel lock held.
   o  There should be also a kernel option for reserving memory, not only I/O.
   o  Leaving traces of the previously allocated region in release_resource()
      needs more thinking about -- in case you load a driver with an incorrect
      base address and then unload it because it doesn't work, the region
      should disappear.
   o  We need to handle "not free, but allow requesting" regions (typically
      space known to be occupied by a card, but not allocated by a driver yet).
      Maybe we should look at track occupiedness and allocatedness as two
      completely different attributes. This would look this way:
	check_resource()	if ALLOCATED, fail
	request_resource()	set ALLOCATED
	release_resource()	reset ALLOCATED; if OCCUPIED not set, delete the region
	occupy_resource()	find !OCCUPIED && !ALLOCATED region
				set OCCUPIED
	vacate_resource()	reset OCCUPIED; if not ALLOCATED, delete the region
      This way we could gather information about all cards during bootup
      (partly by scanning the bus as in PCI case, partly maybe by asking
      the PNP BIOS -- Keith Owens was already experimenting with this),
      be safe wrt. allocation of addresses for hotplug devices, but also
      leave the old request/release semantics used in all the drivers intact.
				Have a nice fortnight
