I received only one reply to my previous email on this topic, from
someone who saw the same problem.  I have now done some more testing,
including trying another machine.  I would really appreciate some
feedback, since this appears to be a kernel bug.
The two machines are an Alpha EV5/6 767, and an Alpha EV5 433.
### 2.2.11 WORKS ###
# dmesg | grep qlogic
qlogicisp : new isp1020 revision ID (5)
# cat /proc/scsi/isp1020/0
QLogic ISP1020 SCSI on PCI bus 01 device 20 irq 27 base 0x9000
### Red Hat's 2.2.12-10 FAILS ###

### 2.3.17 and 2.3.18 FAIL ###

Thanks,
