Traditionally the proper place -has- been
* the reboot notifier
* the ->remove hook (hot unplug, and module remove)
which covers all the cases.
Add a ->shutdown hook is more of a hack.  If you want to introduce this 
facility in a systematic way, introduce a 'kexec reboot' option which 
walks the device tree and shuts down hardware.
->shutdown is just a piecemeal, uncoordinated effort (uncoordinated in 
the sense that driver shutdowns occur in an undefined order).
