Look:
We call wait_event() , condition is FALSE at the moment  :
    do {
         if (condition)
                 break;
    /* and here we have condition changed  to TRUE  */
    /*  process is NOT in any wait queue yet  */
    /*  then  unroll     __wait_event(wq, condition);        */
     do {							DEFINE_WAIT(__wait);					for (;;) {
	prepare_to_wait(&wq, &__wait, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
          /* at this point condition is TRUE , process is in a wait queue 
and its state is
             TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE.   If  rescheduling happens now the 
process will asleep,
              despite of condition is  TRUE . And will not be woken up until 
next wake_up happens
              Is that correct ?  */
	if (condition)						     break;
                    schedule();
        }
   finish_wait(&wq, &__wait);
} while (0)
   /*  end of unroll __wait_event*/
} while (0)
