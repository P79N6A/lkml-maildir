Agreed also. I already had a version that simply replaced the ->nopage
method of vma_ops but took what forced unmount patch had to get proper
->close dealings. But I completely agree that sane revocation should
allow close(2) and munmap(2) on the revoked fd and shared mapping.
I'll put them on my todo and in the meanwhile, you can find the latest

Thanks for taking the time to review the patch!
