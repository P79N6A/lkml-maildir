please note that the master lock is taken by try_caputure only if new 
atom is created.  It is likely than current thread has an atom already 
or the block already captured.

There was a code to measure lock contention for reiser4 locks which 
showed that the tmgr lock was contented less than atom and jnode spin 
locks were.

I think the txnh lock and the tmgr lock are _non_nested.  And, there is  
a place where two atom locks are taken in deadlock-free order w/o 
always keeping correct order of unlocking.  The latest thing can be 
made lock-validator-friendly.
