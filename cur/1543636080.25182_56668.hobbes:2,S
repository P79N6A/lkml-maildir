That's ok then. It shouldn't produce significant overhead. But on the 
routers that I run I have either no netfilters at all, or they keep 
running, so even if they were a module, they'd never have any time to 
unload.

No, because that would be pointless. And it would keep the kernel from 
running properly on systems without a c compiler.
