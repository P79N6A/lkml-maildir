this is some ugly code. we're doing a lookup on a physical address to
see if this is memory we previously allocated and returning a kernel
pointer to the page.
the particular snippet in question (that uses MAXMEM) is an ugly attempt
to verify the address is a real physical address, before using __va()
on something like an i/o region. A better approach than comparing
MAXMEM would probably be to convert the address to a mapnr and compare
to max_mapnr.
I'll clean up this code and post a patch in the next couple of days.
in the meantime, the current patches out there should be good.
Thanks,
Terence
