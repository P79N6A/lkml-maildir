Subject: [2.5.7] initrd issue

I was trying to use 2.5.7 with initrd. I checked almost all configuration
options, but it's still loading RAM-Disk in one line (ext2 filesystem
detected etc.) and 'freeing Xkb initrd memory' in the next one. On 2.2 there
was sth. like 'VFS: Mounting initrd..sth...' but there's nothing like that.
What's wrong? I've got initrd, romfs and (optionally) compressed romfs
support compiled-in
