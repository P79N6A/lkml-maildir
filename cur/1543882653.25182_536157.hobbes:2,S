I agree!
Let a stable governor like performance or userspace be the default to
get the cpufreq up and running during boot up, and later on have some
init script switch
to a preferred governor like powersave/ondemand/conservative.
Changing governor is just a matter of loading the appropriate module
and echoing the appropriate value into
/sys/devices/*/cpufreq/scaling_governor. Hardly takes any time.
William, Is there a specific reason why you would want
powersave/ondemand/conservative to be activate during the system boot
up?
