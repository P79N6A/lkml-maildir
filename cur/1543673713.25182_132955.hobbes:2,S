Sounds like what you really want is capabilities, and not in the
setcap sense.  I think this would be marvellous, myself, and I
completely agree that we need it to be user friendly.
To some degree, groups are also capabilities, but there is too much
rigamarole surrounding them.  I also think evidence has shown that
it's too hard to add or remove group ownership; you basically need the
user to log out completely in order to add or drop the new ownerships.
