My Hp laptop is not broken!!!!
(well at least the routing tables get usb right!)
Model == hp pavillion le4101
kernel == 2.4.25
To get usb working I have to remove the "broken_hp_laptop" patch.
The machine does get Cardbus and ethernet irq's wrong so all isn't completely good.
Anyone interested in  the details?
please cc me in any reply.
Thanks in advance...
