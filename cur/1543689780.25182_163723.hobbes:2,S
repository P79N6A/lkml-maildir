Subject line says it all...I'm testing the 2.6.0-test4 kernel (after an absence since about 2.6.65), and everything appears to be working great, except about five seconds after boot on my dual AMD 2000MP box, the internal PC speaker starts emitting a continuous high-pitched tone. Sounds like the kernel is trying to warn me of something, but I don't think I have such an option configured. My everyday 2.4.21 kernel doesn't do this. My .config is attached. Ideas, anyone?
