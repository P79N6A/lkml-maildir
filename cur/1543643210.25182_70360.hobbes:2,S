Some of that may be a byproduct of the "all the worlds' a webserver"
mindset - we are primarily focussed on the server side (aka
money side ;)), and there is some amount of automatic thinking that
this means we're going to be sending data and receiving small packets,
mostly acks) in return. There is much less emphasis given to solving
the problems on the other side (active connection scalability for 
instance), or other issues that manifest themselves as 
client side bottlenecks for most applications..
thanks,
