This is hardware behaving as designed but not supported by the kernel. IBM was
aware of the problem and working on a solution. Since the offending hardware is
a PCI card that is useless under Linux. The simple solution is to remove it.
If IBM wants these cards to work with Linux they should do a lot more than
supply patches that keep the kernel from crashing.  At a minimum, publish specs
so someone else can patch the kernel and write drivers to make full use of the
card's features under Linux. We're still hoping.

Wish I could have. Our machines would totally freeze.
