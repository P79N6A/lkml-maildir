Hi,
Are there any documentation which list the actual module
name associated with block-major-xx, ie. block-major-8?
After rebooting with a monolithic kernel, I get the
following error message:
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k block-major-8, errno 2
Is block-major-8 an alias for a particular module name?
If so, how can I find out the actual name.
Jeff
