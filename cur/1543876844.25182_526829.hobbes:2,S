OK.
This is excecptionally gruesome, but one could run sched_getaffinity()
against pid 1 (init).  Which will break nicely in the OS-virtualised future
when the system has multiple pid-1-inits running in containers...

OK.  Your cost of counting those bits is proportional to CONFIG_NR_CPUS.
It's a bit sad that sys_sched_get_get_affinity() returns sizeof(cpumask_t),
because that means that userspace must handle 256 or whatever CPUs on a
machine which only has two CPUs.
Does anyone see a reason why sys_sched_getaffinity() cannot be altered to
return maximum-possible-cpu-id-on-this-machine?  That way, your hweight
operation will be much faster on sane-sized machines.

OK.
Does anyone see a reason why we cannot do this?

I guess we could add a simple sys_get_nr_cpus().  If we want more than that
(ie: topology, SMT/MC/NUMA/numa-distance etc) then it gets much more complex
and sysfs is more appropriate for that.
