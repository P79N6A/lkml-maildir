	What kind of performance slow down? I have two Thunderbird 1.4Ghz
on an Tyan Tiger MP and they are quite fast (that is what I call
totally-subjective-and-no-value-at-all benchmark :-)

	I've hear about some problems with the ALU Integer operation,
mainly reported by SiSoft Sandra SMP tests, (look at the Tyan forum
in www.amdmb.com), but at the end it seems that both the Thunderbird and
the Palomino have the same problem.
	I would like to benchmark the ALU Integer operation in SMP under
linux, maybe after all the low scores are due to a low quality OS :-)
Do you know about any "standard" benchmark that run in linux and stress
SMP ALU Integer operation?

	I bought the Thunderbird because they cost half the money than
the MP, and mainly because of availability (uhmm, not sure about this
word), here in Spain few people knows about MP Athlon, and even fewer
could get their hands on them.
