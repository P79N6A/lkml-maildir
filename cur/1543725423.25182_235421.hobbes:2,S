That's almost exactly the error I've gotten from four(!) of my Maxtor  
7Y250M0 SATA disks. One I sent back for repair, and the remaining three  
and the replacement disk are mounted in the chassi, but not connected.  
Figured it to be something related to my controller, but as we don't seem  
to have the same controller, I suppose it's either a bug in the Maxtor  
firmware or something software related. Too bad I don't have another SATA  
controller to try this out on.
I am running a destructive badblocks(8) on the disks as it seems to be a  
good way of provoking this error (the time it takes for the error to  
appear varies greatly). Can't remember how I tested the first disk (the  
one I sent back), but the first two from this batch were connected to port  
four of my Promise S150 SX4 card. The next two were connected to port one,  
to decrease the chances of anything being wrong with a port or cable.
I have attached some information that may or may not be relevant to you  
people, but I'll highlight the errors so I won't have to spam you with  
three complete dmesgs (I'll attach the first dmesg in its entirety. The  
remaining dmesgs are available on request).
I don't have the dmesg for the very first drive I had failing, but the  
error was quite similar. That one ran on a slightly patched 2.6.6-kernel  
with ACPI enabled though. These three are vanilla 2.6.7 with ACPI  
disabled. I haven't been able to provoke the error on my fourth disk yet,  
but I guess it's only a matter of time.

I can run additional tests for you, with kernels patched and configured  
anywhich way you want it. Just let me know
Also, about the unkill:able part, I'm having the same problem with  
whatever process it is that is accessing it. Which does kind-of reduce the  
usability when having it in a software RAID-5 array. When one disk fails,  
the array hangs.
