Yup ;)

page dirty starts at the number of dirty buffers on the page, and as
we map each dirty buffer into the I/O we decrement the page dirty count.
Hence if we map all of the buffers into the I/O, we are cleaning
the entire page and hence we can clear the dirty state on the page.

Yes, partial-page-only case when doing speculative write clustering. We'll hit
this when an extent boundary is not page aligned (fs block size < page size
case) and we need to issue at least two separate I/Os to clean the page.
Because we leave the page dirty and we are working ahead of the index in
generic_writepages() we'll get the rest of the page flushed when we return
back to generic_writepages() as the page is still dirty in the mapping
tree....

Ok, thanks, Linus.
Cheers,
Dave.
