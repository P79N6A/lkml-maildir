Right.
LVM does a similar thing storing UUIDs in its private metadata area
on every device used by it.
Problem is: neither MD nor LVM define a standard in Linux which *needs* to be
used on every device!
It is just up to the user to configure devices with them or not.
BTW: in case we had a Linux standard it wouldn't solve the
"different OS" situation mentioned in this thread either.
Generally speaking:
It is not the problem to reserve some space to store a uuid or something
at such and such location on a device.
The problem is the lack of a standard which eventually
could be implemented in all OSes at some point in time.
OS dependent data migration tools presumed, we could have
that standard in place on (all) real devices a little later than that ;-)
And what about a standard to access the stored identifying
data and to avoid that it doesn't get overwritten by accident?
