Ah, I was reading the patch incidentally against 2.2 patch where devfs support
is not included, so I wasn't thinking the devfs way ;). Thanks for the
explanation.
I assume it's not possible to mknod on top of devfs.  So then we could use a
temporary device in /var/tmp or whatever for that.  However those workarounds
tends to be ugly.
Probably the best way to preserve the IOP that I recommend for beta6 is to add
a new ioctl to the VG chardevice.  Rename VG_CREATE to VG_CREATE_OLD.
VG_CREATE_OLD is a wrapper that calculates the minor number from the inode and
then fallbacks into VG_CREATE, and the new VG_CREATE is the one that gets
the minor of the vg from userspace.
Either ways we don't break backwards compatibilty across 0.9* cycle.
If there would been a strong reason and it would be a mess to provide backwards
compatibilty I would of course agree to raise at IOP 11, but just to avoid a
few lines of code for a wrapper or a temporary mknod on /tmp for a devfs-only
fix, I think it worth to preserve IOP 10.
