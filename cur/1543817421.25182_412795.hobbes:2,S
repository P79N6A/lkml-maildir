I don't see any problem over loopback either.  Perhaps I'll try increasing
delays with tc netem.  That will have to wait until later.
In any case, I tried on our NetApp FAS-250, and I see the same problem:
Mount options are:
netapp:/home /nfs/netapp/home nfs rw,v3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,hard,intr,tcp,lock,addr=netapp 0 0
I don't have stat zeroing, so I rolled some scripts.   Sorry, these are
not vanilla kernels; if you don't nail this today, I'll try and find time
for git bisection over the weekend.
