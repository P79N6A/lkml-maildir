     I've seen quite a few posts here with people having problems with
corrupted file systems, seeking beyond end of device, etc, with 2.2.13.
     I hadn't had any problems this way up until now, but also until recently
I've been using all SCSI systems, mostly because I am running mostly Sun
Sparc based systems, but one PC here with IDE just did the following while
writing tapes:
  DUMP: Date of this level 0 dump: Sun Dec  5 19:15:51 1999

     The thing that is weird is that fsck doesn't find anything wrong with this
file system so I'm not sure if this is a file system problem or a dump problem.
