From gcc(1):
       -fweb
           Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and
           assign each web individual pseudo register.  This allows our register
           allocation pass to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens
           several other optimization passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and
           trivial dead code remover.  It can, however, make debugging impossible,
           since variables will no longer stay in a ``home register''.
           Enabled at levels -O3.
