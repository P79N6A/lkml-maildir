Hi,
I would like to mention that in 2.3.51 there is a huge problem with 
modules related to recent changes in fs-register-unregister interface.
First let's see the bug itself:
yellow:/usr/src/linux/fs/isofs # insmod ./isofs.o
yellow:/usr/src/linux/fs/isofs # lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
isofs                  19164   0  (unused)
yellow:/usr/src/linux/fs/isofs # mount /dev/hdc /cdrom
mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
yellow:/usr/src/linux/fs/isofs # lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
isofs                  19164   3
yellow:/usr/src/linux/fs/isofs # ls /cdrom
.  ..  dist  from~1.nic  store
yellow:/usr/src/linux/fs/isofs # umount /cdrom
yellow:/usr/src/linux/fs/isofs # lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
isofs                  19164   2
yellow:/usr/src/linux/fs/isofs # rmmod isofs
isofs: Device or resource busy
As you can see there are extra 2 "links" to the module left. 
I dig the problem and have found that it seems to be a bug in 
'try_inc_mod_count'. Or in how it is used. Nevertheless, I suggest
something like splitting this function in two -- one that checks and
one that sets usecount value. 
I suspect who is the author of these changes ( Al, is it you ? :) ). But
since I do not know exactly who it is, I think you excuse me for the 
wide distribution.
Thanks,
Roman.
