Original? This was done on VAXen and in Mach ages ago.
On Linux, there've already been two implementations, one by Hugh
Dickens and an expanded version by Bill Irwin (presented at OLS in
2003).
Bill's patch was notable for going to heroic efforts to maintain
binary compatibility, basically separating the userspace notion of the
ABI's page size from the kernel's. How's your version fair here?
