	I've been looking at Willy's fixes, and the typo (first patch)
and locking fix (third patch) both look good to me.  The second patch
(the dead code warning) points out a real problem, in that the code in
question really has no function, but the patch probably doesn't go far
enough for a final solution (the variable that code would set,
arp_target_hw_addr, is referenced in other places, but ends up always
being NULL because the dead code is the only place it was ever set).
	A more proper solution would be to simply delete the dead code
and the arp_target_hw_addr variable, and replace the variable
references with NULL.  This means that all of the ARP probes sent will
be sent out as broadcasts, which is what's already happening, this
just makes the code clearer.  Patch follows (which replaces Willy's
second patch).
	Does this sound reasonable to everybody?
