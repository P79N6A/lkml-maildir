I think what we are seeing is XBoot rather than yaboot and we tried just
about all conceivable "kernel options", as exposed by Xboot. When Xboot
comes up it shows a ramdisk_size=8192 as the only default parameter.
Rapidly growing to hate the non-intuitive nature of the MAC OS we are
not experts on the Mac OS.  P.S. We are running Mac OS 9.1.
Oops, We just discovered that Xboot does not work with MacOS 9.1 (geez)
.... you MUST use yaboot.
We will try the Q4 release.
Thanks,
Tim

add "video=ofonly" to your boot command line.  That is, at the yaboot
"boot: " prompt, type "linux video=ofonly"
If that doesn't work, try something else :)
