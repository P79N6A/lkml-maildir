I didn't know about getxattr etc.  They would work too.

Do you mean for mtime versus atime (versus ctime)?  Yes, in that case
getxattr etc. would be a better choice.
How hard would this be to do?  (Is it something you can do?  :-)
Coreutils CVS assumes that the time stamp resolution is the same for
all files within the same file system.  Is this a safe assumption
under Linux?  I now worry that some NFS implementations might violate
that assumption, if a remote host is exporting several native file
systems, with different native resolutions, to the local host under a
single mount point.  On the other hand, NFSv3 and NFSv4 clearly state
that the time stamp resolution is a per-filesystem concept, so perhaps
we should just consider that to be a buggy NFS server configuration.

Not as far as I know, no.
