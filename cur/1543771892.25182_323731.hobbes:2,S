        Hi Brice,
    What is your X configuration ? The default parameters are ok for a 
VideoRam parameter up to 32MB. Could you check two things, please ?
    - First, could you set VideoRam to 32MB in your X conf.
    - Second, could you set it to 64MB and use a voffset=64 parameter 
for intelfb.
Thanks
Sylvain
