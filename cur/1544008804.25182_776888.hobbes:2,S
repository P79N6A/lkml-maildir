I've given your patch a try and the few resumes from STR I've done were 
all successful. That's not 100% conclusive yet, but a nice start.
Some info from logs etc. below.

The theory that it is really a resume issue and not a device layout issue 
sounds logical. Especially as everything always works correctly after a 
normal boot.

Below info from 3 kernels, all based on 2.6.28-rc7-91:
A) unpatched
B) with the revert/debug patch
C) with the oneliner "ignore transparent bridges" patch
AFAICT all results are probably as expected.
