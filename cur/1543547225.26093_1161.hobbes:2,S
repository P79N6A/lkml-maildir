Comododo PHBs had nothing to do with it. And the Commododo floppy
disk format is quite literally unreadable with a PC style controller. It was
not an economic decision. If you are going to carp please do so from a
basis of real knowledge Alexander. (The REAL blame for the disk fiasco
goes to the people at Metacrap^H^H^H^HComCo.)

Metacomco designed it based on their TripOS. OFS is very good for
repairing the filesystem in the event of a problem, although the so called
DiskDoctor they provided quickly earned the name DiskDestroyer.
Metacomco and BSTRINGS and BPOINTERS and all that nonsense
entered the picture when it was decided the originally planned OS was
would take too long to develop. So what Metacomco had was grafted
onto what the old Amiga Inc had done resulting in a hodgepodge
mess.

As it turns out many of the recovery tools people built worked remarkably
well on FFS when it was introduced with little modification. (Most of the
time tracing the actual data blocks was not necessary for rebuilding the
disk. Thus the datablock metadata loss was not crippling.) FFS appeared
in its first versions with AmigaDOS 1.3. (Er, if you want a copy of some of
the earliest versions sent to developers for testing I can arrange something
in that regard. I believe I still have most of that "stuff".) It underwent
several
rewrites as successive developers and demands were placed on it. One
major change is evidenced in the hash algorithm used for the original
OFS and FFS. It fails to treat international characters correctly when
removing case. The international version corrected this deficiency. The
old cruft is preserved for reading old disks. Later on DirCache was added
principly for floppy disks. About that time Randall added both so called
soft links and hard links. For what it is worth it took a long long time and
series of modifications before either of them worked adequately.

They MAY be fixed in the OS3.5 BoingBag 2 (service pack 2 with a
cutsiepie name.) Heinz has committed yet another rewrite.

Indeed, poor or not it exists and we live with it in the Amiga community.
(Um, I wonder if I could talk Hendrix into a copy of the source for SFS so
it could be ported to Linux.... These days I prefer it to FFS. {^_-})
If you want I can bend your ear on things Amiga for longer than your
patience stretches, I suspect. (I've been following the threads discussions
because there is a project I'd like to port from NT to Linux that just ain't
gonna make it until some nice threads are added and latencies drop
dramatically. RT_Linux may be overkill. But as it sits today Linux is
underkill when you need 1/4 frame and less timing latencies on Show
Control operations. <petasigh>)
