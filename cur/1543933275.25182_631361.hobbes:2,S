No, the ->wait_until_sent() will not be reached if the buffer empties
before timeout jiffies have elapsed.  This behavior differs from that
prior to commit 5a52bd4a2dcb570333ce6fe2e16cd311650dbdc8.
I turned this up while using a little serial download utility to
bootstrap an ARM-based eval board.  The util worked fine on 2.6.22.x,
but consistently failed on 2.6.23.x.  Once I'd determined that, I
narrowed things down with git bisect, and found the above difference
in logic in tty_wait_until_sent() by inspection.
If you'd like a more in-depth analysis of what's breaking on the
user-space side, I can certainly investigate further and (hopefully) come
up with a simple test case that tickles this issue.
