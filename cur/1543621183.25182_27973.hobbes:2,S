The current implementation of fsync_dev is about as good as
it'll get for journal=writeback mode - write the data,
run a commit, write the data again then wait on it all.

I don't understand the whole thread :)
The patch I sent yesterday, which is at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/2.4/2.4.18-pre9/sync_livelock.patch
provides sensible and safe sync semantics, and avoids livelock.
It'd be good if someone else could, like, apply and test it, rather
than sending out all this email and stuff.
