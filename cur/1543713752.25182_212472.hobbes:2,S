Accessing m->mnt_flags will do just fine ;-)

Yes, but that's S_NOATIME in inode->i_flags, not MS_NOATIME in sb->s_flags.
Actually, I've been wrong here - we *do* need that check, since there are
filesystems that force noatime or nodiratime.
From grepping for that stuff it appears that
a) a bunch of filesystems force nodiratime and do not allow to override it
on remount.  Same for noatime (BTW, noatime implies nodiratime, so setting
both is pointless).
b) some filesystems force nodiratime at mount time, but do not care to preserve
it on remount.  Most of those are my fault - I've missed the remount side of
things in readdir patch.  They should have nodiratime always on to match
the original behaviour.  IMO, both (a) and (b) should be handled by a new
field - sb->s_forced_flags.  do_remount_sb() would set those in flags before
doing anything else.  Note that assignment to ->s_flags in do_remount_sb()
is not safe - e.g. ext[23] can get forced r/o by fs error and if that
happens after return from ->remount_sb() but before assignement, we are
screwed.  IOW, do_remount_sb() will need more work.
c) XFS has an odd wankfest around MS_NOATIME - grep for XFSMNT_NOATIME and
XFS_MOUNT_NOATIME.  AFAICS the only use is in xfs_ichgtime() and it's
redundant - we check IS_NOATIME() right after checking for XFS_MOUNT_NOATIME
there.  However, that will become very interesting when it gets to
per-mountpoint r/o
        /*
         * We're not supposed to change timestamps in readonly-mounted
         * filesystems.  Throw it away if anyone asks us.
         */
        if (unlikely(vp->v_vfsp->vfs_flag & VFS_RDONLY))
                return;
in xfs_ichgtime() is too damn deep in call chains, so...
d) nfs_getattr() is very odd - it overloads semantics of noatime and nodiratime
for NFS in a strange way.
