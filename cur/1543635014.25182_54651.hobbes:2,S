This is exactly a reason why O(1) shouldn't go into 2.4:
E.g. my X is as suggested by my the installation routine of my
distribution (Debian unstable/testing) niced to -10. It would be a bad
surprise for _many_ people if they upgrade their 2.4 kernel because of
other security and/or stability fixes and such a setting is then wrong.
