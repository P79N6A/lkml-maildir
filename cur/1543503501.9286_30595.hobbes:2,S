I've seen similar problems with 2.2.5 (RH 6.0 plus PPTP masq patches).
In my case it's with an ne2k-pci.  It's not only the RH6.0 ping bug, as 
TCP connections have slowed to a painful crawl from time to time, and are
fixed by running network down and then network up.
If I see it in a newer kernel I'll poke around some...
