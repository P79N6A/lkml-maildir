No. The current patches only trigger when a _root_ bridge is
hot-added, not a PCI to PCI bridge (which is what the docking 
station is). The code to support p2p bridge hotplug will benefit
from these patches but more code is needed to support that.

It scans the ACPI namespace under the root bridge that was added.
Any pci devices underneath are scanned and added, but there isn't
any code to look for non-PCI devices there.
