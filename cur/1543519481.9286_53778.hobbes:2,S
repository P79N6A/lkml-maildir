Would it be possible to base these kind of events on a jiffie-count based
clock? (prefereably not by touching gettimeofday but by implementing a posix
real time clock)?
That would require sourcecode changes, but hey, xfree would probably
implement this, if feasible.
Surely, X programs doing accurate time measurements do not rely on the x
timestamps?
If monotony is a problem (it most probably is), then X could increment the
us counter on each call to its own gettimeofday function.
