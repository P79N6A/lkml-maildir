No offence, but I must say that falls into the "my xxx is bigger than
your xxx" category of applications I mentioned in an earlier posting.

Now you are being x86is again, for some architectures it is actually
very important to know the FPU type. On the m68k where the 68040 &
68060 implement a subset of the FPU instructions using kernel
emulation and one gets better performance by using code optimized for
the floating point instructions these CPUs provide natively.
