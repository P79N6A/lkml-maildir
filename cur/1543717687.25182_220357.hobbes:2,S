Hi Jean,
The reason I have the renumbering in pci_ids.h and the new device
support in i2c-i801 in the same patch, is that the new device support is
dependent on the devices being added to pci_ids.h.  However, if it is
the consensus that these be two separate patches, I can separate them.
As far as using the ICHx model name is concerned; I can not use the
model name "82801xx" until after the product has launched.  I have also
seen requests to use the ICHx name rather then the model number.  Again,
if it is the consensus, I can go back after the product launches and
change all of the #defines, for the device, to use the model number
rather than the "common" name.
I will look into providing the same patch for the 2.4 kernel.
Thank you very much for looking at my patch,
Jason Gaston

Hi Jason,
A few comments on your patch:

To me, there are two different things here and you should split your
patch accordingly for clarity.  The renumbering of the entries should go
in a first patch, then the new devices support in i2c-i801 in a second.
I would also suggest that you follow the common habit to name the Intel
82801 chips after their numerical name (82801AA. 82801BA, etc...) and
not their nickname (ICH, ICH2...) in both the entries and the comments. 
Not that it is absolulety better, but that's the way we did so far, so
why change now?
I would appreciate it if you could submit a similar patch for the 2.4
version of the i2c-i801 driver as held in the lm_sensors project.
Thanks.
