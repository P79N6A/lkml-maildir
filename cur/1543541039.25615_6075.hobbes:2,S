I guess you just need to change the request_irq call in the SMART2 driver
to specify the SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM flag. I'm not sure if it is a good idea 
though, because e.g. for bulk data transfers the intervals between RAID
interrupts are probably not very random and may add bogus numbers to your
entropy pool.
The randomness generation in scsi/* is also not used, because SMART2 bypasses
the SCSI layer completely. You could probably add add_blkdev_randomness to
the right function in SMART2, assuming the times are random enough (which is
not clear, e.g. the raid firmware could in theory smoothen it a lot)
