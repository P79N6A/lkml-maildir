Hmm, so is there no way at all we could support it?  I know it sounds
a bit pointless for a typical server or desktop machine, but it's
getting increasingly possible, practical, and attractive to use Linux
boxes more like minicomputers - dual headed VGA cards are cheap, and
USB allows you to connect practically as many keyboards and mice as
you want to.
I'm just thinking that at some point in the future, buying a new
machine could be less pratical than hot plugging in an additional VGA
card, keyboard, monitor and mouse, and editing a config file
somewhere.  With the new input layer, we are very close to this being
a reality.
John.
