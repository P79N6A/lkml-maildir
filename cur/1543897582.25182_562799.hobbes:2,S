This isn't quite crypto code and isn't connected to or through the cryptoapi
(at least not in this patchset), so I somehow find it misplaced in the crypto/
directory. If all its users are in drivers/md/ then that would be a
better place.
If it is something kernel-global, lib/ sounds more appropriate?
