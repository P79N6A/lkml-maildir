Subject: [PROBLEM] linux-2.4.20-rc3: ksoftirqd_CPU0 eats cpu and locks orinoco driver

Just an FYI. 
I built 2.4.20-rc3 w/ the hermes/orinoco wireless ethernet driver (ver:
0.11b from in-kernel source). Everything would work fine until I started
putting load on the network card. ksoftirqd_CPU would then peg the cpu
usage to 100%, and the network connection would die. Popping the card
out immediately would stop ksoftirqd from going crazy and everything
would carry on fine (re-inserting the card, light network traffic, etc).
I built and installed the orinoco-0.13beta1 code and that solved the
problem. 
Might a re-sync be considered before 2.4.20-final?
thanks
