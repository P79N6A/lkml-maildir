I appreciate your insight.
I've never seen a "lun" in _any_ spec.  It is always abbreviated
"LUN".
"lun" exists only in the SCSI Core.  Even other OSs use "LUN".
So after a while, after someone reads enough specs, they see
only "LUN".  "lun" seems foreign.

Not quite.  I can actually _see_ "LUN" in the frame.
As I said, after a while it becomes second nature to you,
due to the layout of the frame you're working with.
The pattern that the brain sees is "LUN": in the
transport frame and in the code.

P.S. Trust me, using "lun" would be quite ugly and it would
show that whoever coded it has had little experience reading
SCSI specs.  What you want to use is "u8 LUN[8]".
PPS. I hope I don't have to put up this sort of convincing
emails back and forth for each and every little thing.  We'd
get nowhere, no code will be written and no hardware would
work.
