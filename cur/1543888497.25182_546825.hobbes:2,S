Can you also provide /proc/acpi/wakeup and /proc/bus/usb/devices?
Plus "ethool eth0" and "ethtool -i eth0"?
And, for a bit more info, the output of the appended script.
(That's all *with* the patch listed below -- not reverted.)

Which only affects PCI devices at this time, FWIW ...
This is a symptom of a device or driver misbehaving.  You can
work around that; update the relevant /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup
value(s) to "disabled", pending a driver bugfix (or workaround).
In fact, you could turn them all off (see appended diagnostic
script) then turn them on one at a time to highlight problems
Reverting that patch just papers over the problem...
My suspicion, based on the dmesg and seeing what drivers actually
try to enable wakeup, would be the 'sky2' driver.  The other two
obvious candidates are EHCI (which behaves for me on non-Intel
hardware) and UHCI ... but USB has had a fair amount of testing
in terms of wakeup mechanisms, so that seems a bit less likely
to me (assuming no hardware bugs).
However, since after reverting the patch above you still saw
other problems (immediate re-suspend) I'm suspecting this isn't
a single simple problem you're finding.
