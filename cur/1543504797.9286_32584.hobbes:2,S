        Hi All!
Some time ago, in time of releasing 2.2.0-pre9 me and edmund@rano.demon.co.uk
propose patch that allowed more complete support of Unicode, for instace
possibility to cut/paste with mouse on UTF mode console and also between
ASCII and UTF consoles as well. I also propose possibility to get current
console mode using ESC sequences. But Peter Anvin refuse all this changes
and said that current console driver bad and have to be completely replaced
by new one. Today I read that in Linus's plans feature freeze in a few weeks.
IMO the worst thing have place - we have neither new console driver nor
improvement in existing one.
For now I have patches for all fetarues proposed at that time and also several
new for kernel 2.3.12. May be better to include this patches to current
kernel now ? Or we going to releasing kernel 2.4 with the same broken console
driver which even can't make cut/paste operation in UTF mode ?
        Sincerely Yours, Stanislav Voronyi.
