This is probably a bug in the new ld code (which is still quite unreleased,
even if bleeding-edge distro builds are using it already).  Please work
with me (off the kernel list) to figure that out.

This probably just requires a linker script tweak to use the NOTES macro.
Maybe:
--- a/arch/sparc64/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
+++ b/arch/sparc64/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
@@ -19,6 +19,7 @@ SECTIONS
     SCHED_TEXT
     LOCK_TEXT
     KPROBES_TEXT
+    NOTES
     *(.gnu.warning)
   } =0
   _etext = .;
I did not change every platform's script where I wasn't sure if a change
was required or what it needed to be.  It may be that every platform that
doesn't use the NOTES macro in its vmlinux.lds.S really needs to.  (Place
it anywhere you like that is appropriate for a few dozen read-only bytes
that will rarely be read.)

There's no expectation of changing anything about the layout.
Just a linker script tweak might be required so the tiny new
section falls somewhere proper in the existing layout.

I have indeed performed some odd feats in this area in the past, but in
this case there should be not any need for anything of the sort.
I would prefer not to let the feature lag while every platform gets around
to adding a Makefile line.  It really should be universal and simple to
deal with.  The ld feature is still so bleeding-edge that there should be
ample time to iron out kinks before anyone could be bit by it who wasn't
really asking for it.
Thanks,
Roland
