Beyond me. Some kind of sophisticated California thing that us
poor folks in New Mexico can hardly imagine, I suppose.

If you have TLB load, you can sabotage hw walking and at least see whether
you can beat it. I think it could be done, because the OS could adapt to
the characteristics of the process - using perhaps on mm layout for 
kde applets and a different one for oracle ...

Bats are a good start. What I'd like is also a "small unpaged
process base/limit" set of registers or two.
