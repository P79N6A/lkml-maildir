This is true. Real drivers with only _tables_ to describe the hardware
would be best, but AML would be at least be better than i386 code, if we
have to settle for something less.

Actually, the one time I tried to decompile a DSDT it was a Dell
Inspiron which did _everything_ through SMM traps. It was more opaque
even than a binary-only driver (or BIOS). At least with i386-code I have
_some_ hope of tracing it, if I have enough time and patience.
