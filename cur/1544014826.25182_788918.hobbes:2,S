Hmm, looking at the code...
mutex.c:
       for (;;) {
                struct thread_info *owner;
                old_val = atomic_cmpxchg(&lock->count, 1, 0);
                if (old_val == 1) {
                        lock_acquired(&lock->dep_map, ip);
                        mutex_set_owner(lock);
                        return 0;
                }
                if (old_val < 0 && !list_empty(&lock->wait_list))
                        break;
                /* See who owns it, and spin on him if anybody */
                owner = ACCESS_ONCE(lock->owner);
                if (owner && !spin_on_owner(lock, owner))
                        break;
                cpu_relax();
        }
and in sched.c:
int spin_on_owner(struct mutex *lock, struct thread_info *owner)
{
        unsigned int cpu;
        struct rq *rq;
        int ret = 1;
[...]
                if (lock->owner != owner)
                        break;
We keep spinning if the owner changes.  I wonder if you have many CPUS 
(Chris, how many cpus did this box have?), you could get one task 
constantly spinning while the mutex keeps changing owners on the other 
CPUS.
Perhaps, we should do something like:
mutex.c:
       for (;;) {
                struct thread_info *owner = NULL;
                old_val = atomic_cmpxchg(&lock->count, 1, 0);
                if (old_val == 1) {
                        lock_acquired(&lock->dep_map, ip);
                        mutex_set_owner(lock);
                        return 0;
                }
                if (old_val < 0 && !list_empty(&lock->wait_list)) 
                        break;
                /* See who owns it, and spin on him if anybody */
		if (!owner)
	                owner = ACCESS_ONCE(lock->owner);
                if (owner && !spin_on_owner(lock, owner)) 
                        break;
                cpu_relax();
        }
Or just pull assigning of the owner out of the loop. This way, we go to 
sleep if the owner changes and is not NULL.
Just a thought,
