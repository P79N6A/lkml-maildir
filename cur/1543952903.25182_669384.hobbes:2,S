Thomas,
The justification above is what convinced me
that we should try to integrate this feature.
Further, although we failed in 2.6.25,
I think we should continue to try to get this capability integrated.
If you think it will be useful for additional purposes, that's great.
As you know, I'm somewhat skeptical, as I've seen huge mistakes such
as a database of modified BIOS images created and used when the users
have absolutely no idea what they're doing.  But we don't have to
agree on this to move forward.
thanks,
-Len
