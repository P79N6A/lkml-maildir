I have a very long list of Acer laptops that are supported - which is far too 
long, and changes on far too much of a regular basis to put in there.
Perhaps adding something like "This driver is also a required dependency to 
build the firmware specific drivers needed for many laptops, including Acer 
and HP machines"?
(There's currently another ACPI-WMI based driver in development related to 
more HP laptops, and acer-wmi also supports a handful of non-Acer laptops).
I don't think explaining what WMI is, and how ACPI-WMI is related to it is 
that useful in Kconfig here; so I agree that further elaborating on the 'why' 
this should be enabled is definitely worth doing.

Wouldn't that require 'select' though, and I'm led to believe that's seriously 
frowned upon these days?
