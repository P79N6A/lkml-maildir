I would prefer that the zerocopy changes stay in DaveM's external patch
until they are ready to be merged.  Zerocopy is still changing and being
actively debugged, so it is possible that we might have to patch
starfire.c again with zerocopy updates, before the final patch makes it
to Linus.  Let's wait on zerocopy in the main tree..

If you've got the hardware and time, I'm always happy to see someone
step up ..   I must confess that I haven't seen much of your work to
date, however.

Note that I have not yet sent this patch onto Linus for a reason...

this has not been sent on to linus/alan because, if you do not empty the
Tx ring on tx_timeout, you should check to see if there is space on the
ring before waking the queue.  Otherwise corruption/problems occur...
