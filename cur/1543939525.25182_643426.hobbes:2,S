Normally I would agree, but this file is just so bad, it's not even
funny.  I could not find any userspace tools or documentation that used
it, and the ecryptfs developers never responded to any of my emails
concerning it.
The information is still present, just in a different file, so no
functionality is lost here.

Just another example of why people need to document this kind of thing
in Documentation/ABI/ which prevents such atrocities from ever being
created in the first place...
