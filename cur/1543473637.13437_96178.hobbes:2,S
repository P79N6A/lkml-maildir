I don't think anyone replied to this, so I'll tell you what I've done
when I had the exact same problem a month ago. After a bit of playing,
and reading the LILO docs, I find the following lilo.conf works for me
for the boot sector of the SCSI drive. I can now boot off either drive
by selecting in the BIOS appropriately.
boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
disk=/dev/sda
  bios=0x80
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.36
        label=linux
        root=/dev/sda1
        read-only
The important line is the bios override under the "disk" setting.
If I understand your question correctly I think this solves your
problem.
Neil.
