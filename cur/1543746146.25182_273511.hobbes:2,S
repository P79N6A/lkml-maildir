For the linux folks, here a small comparison of what happens in the working 
(old) case and in the non-working (new) case:
In both case
- Wine gets a first SIGTRAP (in it's sig_trap handler)
	+ Wine converts it into a Windows exception (w-exception in short).
	  This includes creating a context for the generic CPU registers
	+ This w-exception is sent to the w-exception handler the program
	  installed (this one can modifiy the all registers)
		o this handler touches one of the i386 debug registers
	+ as we need to update the debug registers values (and we don't do in
	  the signal handler return), this task is delegated to the Wine server
	  (our central process, which is in charge of synchronisation...)

		  the SIGTRAP.
		> Wine server wait4:s on the SIGSTOP (after ptrace:attach)

	+ wine terminates the sig trap handler and resumes the execution with
	  the modified basic registers (from the saved context), and the
	  modified debug registers (from the Wine server round trip)
- a second sig trap is generated
	> since the wine server is still ptrace:attached, it gets the signal.	
What differs then in both execution:
- in the working case, the sig trap handler is called on the client side, 
whereas it's never called in the non-working case. We do have a couple of 
protection (to avoid some misbehaving apps), but none of them get triggered. So 
it seems like the trap handler is not called (ugh).
A couple of notes:
- as the program tested is copy protected, and as it seems that the copy 
protection is what causes the harm, it can be interesting to know that the 
programe seems to set the TF flag (some copy protection schemes directly do an 
"int 1", but given the exception code we get, this isn't the case).
- in Windows trap handling, the TF is explictly reset before calling the windows 
exception handler (which is what Wine does, before calling the window exception 
handler). Of course the handler can set it back if it wants to continue single 
stepping.
