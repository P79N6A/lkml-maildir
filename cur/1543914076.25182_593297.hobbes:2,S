Ok, it's better to simply remove the CLFLUSH since it's not needed
anyway. Do you recommend to only remove the CLFLUSH from the _early code
(executed before alternatives are applied) or to remove the CLFLUSH from
the normal execution time code also ?

It looks like gorund work that should be done in i386 before we start
using __inline_memcpy in alternative.c which is shared between i386 and
x86_64. I haven't seen the alternative that would touch memcpy at all
anyway, am I missing something ? Also, being "faster" is not really an
issue there, since it is not done often. The only thing that matters is
if memcpy could be touched by alternative.c.

How about adding :
#define INIT_ARRAY(type, val, len) ((type [len]){ [0 ... len] = (val) })
to kernel.h ? It would be more generic.

So you would prefer
unsigned long cr0;
  kernel_wp_save(&cr0)
..
  kernel_wp_restore(cr0);
to
unsigned long cr0;
  kernel_wp_save(cr0)
..
  kernel_wp_restore(cr0);
? It seems odd to me, since everyone would expect flags save/restore to
behave like local_irq_save/restore. Or I may misunderstand your point.

I agree that most kernel_wp_save/restore users should disable interrupts
before calling it (it would be a "good practice"), but I don't expect to
encapsulate irq disabling in these macros, since it is not mandatory.
