Yes, if someone was determined to set this up they'd have to laboriously 
break up overlapping patches into common vs independent pieces, and determine 
that other patches are simply mutually incompatible, thus requiring suitable 
config rule restrictions.  Wow, way too much work for the tree owner, and 
things will re-break frequently when the patch owner makes updates.
Maybe this technique is something that would interest the FOLK guys, where 
the goal is to produce a single tree with as many options as possible, and 
where they're willing to put in extra maintainance work.  Besides the two VM 
designs, there's the XFS patch, which we don't have a good way of integrating 
into a single tree just yet.
Please treat the above as idle speculation.  It's evident that including 
patches in kbuild is an express route to madness.  For one thing, I'd no 
longer be able to index the complete source tree for browsing.
