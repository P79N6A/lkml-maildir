There is another issue with file descriptors - userspace must dig into
kernel each time it wants to get a new set of events, while with memory
based approach it has them without doing so. After it has returned from
kernel and know that there are some evetns, kernel can add more of them
into the ring (if there is a place) and userspace will process them
withouth additional syscalls.
Although syscall overhead is very small, it does exist and should not be 
ignored in the design.
