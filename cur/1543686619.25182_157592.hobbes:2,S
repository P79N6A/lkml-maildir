David, did you read this line:

Let us do it. Let z be an abbreviation for x xor y.
The lemma that you believe in, applied to x and z, says
 entropy(x) >= entropy(x xor z)
 entropy(z) >= entropy(x xor z)
But x xor z equals y, so you believe for arbitrary strings x and y that
 entropy(x) >= entropy(y)
 entropy(x xor y) >= entropy(y).
This "lemma", formulated in this generality, is just plain nonsense.
