I have a high confidence this will work better : I've been using
time-ordered trees in userland projects for several years, and never
found anything better. To be honnest, I never understood the concept
behind the array switch, but as I never felt brave enough to hack
something in this kernel area, I simply preferred to shut up (not
enough knowledge and not enough time).
However, I have been using a very fast struct timeval-ordered RADIX
tree. I found generic rbtree code to generally be slower, certainly
because of the call to a function with arguments on every node. Both
trees are O(log(n)), the rbtree being balanced and the radix tree
being unbalanced. If you're interested, I can try to see how that
would fit (but not this week-end).
Also, I had spent much time in the past doing paper work on how to
improve fairness between interactive tasks and batch tasks. I came
up with the conclusion that for perfectness, tasks should not be
ordered by their expected wakeup time, but by their expected completion
time, which automatically takes account of their allocated and used
timeslice. It would also allow both types of workloads to share equal
CPU time with better responsiveness for the most interactive one through
the reallocation of a "credit" for the tasks which have not consumed
all of their timeslices. I remember we had discussed this with Mike
about one year ago when he fixed lots of problems in mainline scheduler.
The downside is that I never found how to make this algo fit in
O(log(n)). I always ended in something like O(n.log(n)) IIRC.
But maybe this is overkill for real life anyway. Given that a basic two
arrays switch (which I never understood) was sufficient for many people,
probably that a basic tree will be an order of magnitude better.

I find this useful, but to be fair with Mike and Con, they both have
proposed similar tuning knobs in the past and you said you did not want
to add that complexity for admins. People can sometimes be demotivated
by seeing their proposals finally used by people who first rejected them. 
And since both Mike and Con both have done a wonderful job in that area,
we need their experience and continued active participation more than ever.

I'm very pleased to read this. Because as I have already said it, my major
concern with 2.6 was the stock scheduler. Recently, RSDL fixed most of the
basic problems for me to the point that I switched the default lilo entry
on my notebook to 2.6 ! I hope that whatever the next scheduler will be,
we'll definitely get rid of any heuristics. Heuristics are good in 95% of
situations and extremely bad in the remaining 5%. I prefer something
reasonably good in 100% of situations.

Will this have any impact on NUMA/HT/multi-core/etc... ?

Well done !
