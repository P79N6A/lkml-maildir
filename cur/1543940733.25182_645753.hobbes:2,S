You should know that given two different implementations in software of the
same communication protocol, differences in latency and throughput become
more visible as the network latency gets lower and the throughput gets higher.
That's why conclusions can only be drawn from the InfiniBand numbers, and
not from the 1 Gbit/s Ethernet numbers. Assuming that there is something
specific in STGT with regard to InfiniBand is speculation.

I did not draw any conclusions from the architecture -- the only data I based my
conclusions on were my own performance measurements.

My proposal was to have both the SCST kernel code and the STGT kernel
code in the mainstream Linux kernel. This would make it easier for current
STGT users to evaluate SCST. It's too early to choose one of the two
projects -- this choice can be made later on.
