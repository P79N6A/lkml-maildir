Subject: 2.5.59-mjb2 (scalability / NUMA patchset)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/1/28/292

The patchset contains mainly scalability and NUMA stuff, and anything 
else that stops things from irritating me. It's meant to be pretty stable, 
not so much a testing ground for new stuff.
I'd be very interested in feedback from anyone willing to test on any 
platform, however large or small.
