Yes, I vaguely remember. IIRC Linus was the one who mandated the use of
a directory based structure before devfs would be merged, though I think
the particular choice of names was not his fault.
Which is why I've asked people to seperate their distaste for the names
devfs uses from distaste for having a standard set of names.
Originally I was hoping that all those plans to move partition detection
into userspace using device-mapper would help eliminate people's
objections to devfs (AFAIK the devfs-style names hated most by far are
block devices, which are way too long), but it didn't work out that way.
