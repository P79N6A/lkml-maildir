Thank you for clarifying this.
So linux 2.6 from kernel.org stay stable.
And 2.6x-mm is like a 2.7 development tree (thought not that 
experimental ;-) )
From the LWM story i understood that linux will be like windows:
lots of "features" but no stability, except if you use a
 distribution kernel. And that seriously made me think about
 using another free *nix for a stable system.
