It will prevent the CPU from going into sleep states and essentially
keep most of it enabled.

It's the fastest way to read something which needs quite complex
knowledge to turn into a reliable clock value. In general only
the kernel has this knowledge. 
And gettimeofday is optimized to give you the fatest reliable
clock.

Just use gettimeofday. It shields you from all that and when
the hardware supports it is quite fast too.

Yes it does.
