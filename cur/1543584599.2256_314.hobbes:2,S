Just curious, but do you administer any kind of network with users?  Are
they all perfect?  Never changing a setting?  Never screwing anything
up?  ... If so , then it must get boring sitting in your office all day.
According to you, I, nor any of the other millions of computer users/game
players out there, should ever do anything more then install a game and
run it.  Oh wait .. ya know what? .. that involves changing system
settings too ..... darn .. ya know .. I guess I just shouldn't use a
computer at all.... -end of story

What? .... that is very, VERY, low and stupid.
