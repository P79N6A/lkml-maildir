I guess your driver is not working that much OK yet. Many (most)
ethernet boards today will align the IP header on a 4 or 16 bytes boundary.
By default, the ethernet header being 14 bytes, it unaligns the IP header.
But some boards will leave a hole between those. Probably that your driver
needs to tell the hardware to do this. Or maybe you can program the DMA
to get on 4x+2 so that IP gets aligned ?
Anyway, I don't know whether I'm loosing my time because last time
you sent such a report about your driver, I asked for a little more
precisions, which I never received.
