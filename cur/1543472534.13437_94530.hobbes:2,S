If type was an enum, then I could grep the code to find where the enum
is defined.  That makes it crystal clear what values are valid or not.
If it's a #define, and I'm new to the code, and there are no comments
telling me what the 'type' represents, then it is much harder for me to
figure out what it really means.
After delving into it farther, it looks like type may be overloaded
in a thousand different ways, so in this case #defines are probably
the way to go.

The protocol-id for 802.1Q VLAN's is:  0x8100.  The stack is starting
to make a wee bit more sense now, think I know what to do with it!
