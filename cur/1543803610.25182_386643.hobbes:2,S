I hit this and manage to get myself out of it.
I run with many xterm windows open.  After opening the lid in my Inspiron 6000, I switched to a workspace with an open xterm window and type the equivalent of:
    xset dpms force suspend
(I usually use this command to blank the screen "right now".)
  $ more ~/bin/blank
  #! /bin/sh
  sleep 2
  xset dpms force suspend
Then when I move the mouse pointer or press a key, the screen turns back on.
