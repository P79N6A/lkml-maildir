Hi,
I had another system lock up using 2.4.0-test9pre5 +
vmfixes-2.4.0-test9-A1 (by Ingo Molnar). This time
I manage to sample the functions where the kernel
was looping using SysReq + P. Here is the list:
swap_out
swap_out_vma
try_to_swap_out
find_vma
__wake_up
It probably doesn't help much but it was the best
I could do.
System:
UP, 64M, IDE.

P.S: The stability problems started after the VM patches
were integrated, before running test8 + vm3
(Rik van Riel patches) everything was ok...
