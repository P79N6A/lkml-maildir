Looks like my understanding of block I/O is even less than nothing :(
irq_disable() can't prevent from IRQ-context code playing with our io_context
on other CPUs. But this doesn't matter, we are only changing ioc->task.
What does matter, we are clearing the pointer to it: task_struct->io_context,
and IRQ should not look at it, no?
Or... Do you mean it is possible to submit I/O from IRQ on behalf of current ?????
In that case current_io_context() will re-instantiate ->io_context after irq_enable().
What is exit_io_context() for then? It is only called from do_exit() when we know
the task won't start IO.

elv_unregister() takes task_lock(), should see ->io_context == NULL.
