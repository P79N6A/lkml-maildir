If you run benchmark tests with GB Ethernet you loose any right to complain
about unrealistic benchmarks that others might create. A machine with 4 x 100MB
Ethernet cards is a common real world configuration - often more for redundancy
than actual throughput. How many people have GB Ethernet installed, or will do
so in the next 12 months?
Also tell me where I can get a GB Ethernet card for US$70. I can get 4 x 100Mbps
high performance Tulip compatible cards for that. Also where could I get a GB
hub for less than 4 times a 100MB hub?
Lets get real here
Steve
