hmm...not quite sure that the suspend2 ppl want it to become the only
one...we just want to have a fair playing field; that is, not a
situation where we are being told "my code is in the kernel, i like it
much better, work on my code or go away and play somewhere else" when we
have tried the code in the kernel, have found it to be lacking, and have
an alternative that appears to be working much better.

again, i think, nigel is trying to get (3) accomplished:
3) get the out-of-the-tree code merged into the kernel and let
users/developers/distros decide.
