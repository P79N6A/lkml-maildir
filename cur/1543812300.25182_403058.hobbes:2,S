Have you disabled CONFIG_PCI?
CONFIG_PCI is the configuration option for a PCI host, just as
CONFIG_USB is the configuration option for a USB host. Linux contains
code for CONFIG_USB_GADGET, but what you need is the non-existent
CONFIG_PCI_GADGET.
If you're running on a PCI option device (unless using a 21555
non-transparent bridge), you need to disable CONFIG_PCI and write your
own driver for the PCI option device functionality.
