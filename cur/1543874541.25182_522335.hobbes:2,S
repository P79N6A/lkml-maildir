Subject: Sparse participating in Google Summer of Code 2007; apply by March 24th
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/20/380

[Sending this to LKML as well, to reach more of Sparse's user community.]
Google has accepted Sparse as a mentoring organization for Summer of Code
2007.  Interested students can propose work on Sparse-related projects, work
on those projects over the summer, and receive a stipend from Google for their
work.
Student application deadline: March 24th
Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend capable of parsing
most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a collection of sample
compiler backends, including a static analyzer also called 'sparse'. Sparse
provides a set of annotations designed to convey semantic information about
types, such as what address space pointers point to, or what locks a function
acquires or releases.  The Linux kernel community uses Sparse to check for
common errors in kernel source code.  Other projects, such as X.org, have
begun to use Sparse as well.
Working on a Sparse project gives students the opportunity to put many core CS
skills into practice on a real-world compiler and static analyzer, and gain
some recognition within the prominent community of Free and Open Source
Software developers working on the Linux kernel.
You can see the current Summer of Code project list for Sparse at
<
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/soc.html>,
 or propose an idea
of your own.
Students need to apply by March 24th.  You can apply at
<
http://code.google.com/soc>.
Any Sparse developers interested in mentoring projects over the summer (which
primarily consists of answering questions about Sparse, such as on the mailing
list), please apply via the Google Summer of Code mentorship application at
http://code.google.com/soc/mentor.html
 , and check the "Sparse" box.  Please
also mail me with details.
Any Linux developers interested in seeing Sparse do something that it can't
currently do, please propose possible Summer of Code projects as soon as you
can, and I'll add them to
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/devel/sparse/soc.html
 .
