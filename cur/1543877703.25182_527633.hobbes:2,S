Regarding the low bit part, quoting from working gABI chapter 5: "To make
it simpler for tools to interpret the contents of dynamic section entries, the
value of each tag, except for those in two special compatibility ranges, will
determine the interpretation of the d_un union. A tag whose value is an
even number indicates a dynamic section entry that uses d_ptr. A tag
whose value is an odd number indicates a dynamic section entry that uses
d_val or that uses neither d_ptr nor d_val. Tags whose values are less
than the special value DT_ENCODING and tags whose values fall between
DT_HIOS and DT_LOPROC do not follow these rules."
Regarding the OS range, all I can point you to is binutils' include/elf/common.h.
