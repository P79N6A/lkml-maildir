What do you mean by fairness, exactly?
As for its overhead, I just got it working inside UML.  I tried it on
x86_64, but something was wrong with the low-level switching stuff,
and the machine hung whenever a guest scheduler process tried to run.
So, I never got any real measurements.
I had better things to do, so I dropped this and went back to them.
