one thing in it seems bogus:
diff -Naurp preempt-1/kernel/exit.c preempt-2/kernel/exit.c
--- preempt-1/kernel/exit.c        2003-04-14 00:31:39 +0200
+++ preempt-2/kernel/exit.c        2003-04-14 00:31:48 +0200
@@ -282,7 +282,9 @@ struct mm_struct * start_lazy_tlb(void)
        current->mm = NULL;
        /* active_mm is still 'mm' */
        atomic_inc(&mm->mm_count);

        enter_lazy_tlb(mm, current, smp_processor_id());

        return mm;
 }
This is an incremental diff snipplet. The second preempt_disable(); should be 
a preempt_enable(); no?
ciao, Marc
