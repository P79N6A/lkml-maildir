Or you add a lock parameter to wait_event*() which gets unlocked before
schedule and locks again afterwards.
That would allow you to write it like so:
 mutex_lock(&group->notification_mutex);
 wait_event_interruptible_lock(group->notification_waitq,
                               !list_empty(&group_notificatioin_list), 
                               &group_notification_mutex);
 /* handle the !empty list */
 mutex_unlock(&group->notification_mutex);
You could use the type matching magic we have to select between
spinlock/mutex operations for the lock argument.
I've come across such a pattern a few times, most of the times we end up
open coding the wait_event stuff.
