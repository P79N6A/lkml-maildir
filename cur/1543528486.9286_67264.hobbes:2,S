I have the same board with the same kernel.  For some reason the card
reports 32mb with lspci.  I read once that this might have to do with
having the frame buffer console enabled (seems doubtful).  In any case,
the card only has a 16mb frame buffer ; enabling a 16mb write combining
range starting at the prefetchable buffer start address is sufficient,
enabling 32mb will yield no improvement.  And enabling write-combining on
the non-prefetchable range will have disastrous results.
