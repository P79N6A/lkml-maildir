We are running several Athlon 500 and 550s with MSI 6167 boards
here, all equipped with at least 256MB of memory.
The only problems occured with 
a) bad memory (8ns PC100 DIMMs) which gave all sorts of wired crashes
   and fs-corruption. We're using 6ns CAS2 memory now and avoid mixing
   different brands. Never had a crash since then.
b) bad power supplies. Some 230W supplies seem to have difficulties
   with more than 128MB and more than one disk.
   Standard 300W ones seem to be fine.

Hmm. After my experiences, I can't buy that.
