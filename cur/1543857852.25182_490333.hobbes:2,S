That's... arguable.  We certainly don't need lots and lots of initcalls
to be able to run userland code.  Which ones are missing in your opinion?
As for that example, I'd love to see specifics - which driver triggers
hotplug?  Presumably it happens from an initcall, so we also have something
fishy here...
Said that, I think that pipes should be initialized early.
