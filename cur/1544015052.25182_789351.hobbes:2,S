Hi,
I've noticed recently that the MMC/SD block driver does not reference 
count the MMC/SD host driver module that it uses via the MMC/SD core 
layer. Thus, I can rmmod my host driver module while, for example, a 
partition on a SD card is mounted.
Assuming this does not happen intentionally, what would be the correct 
fix? Is a try_module_get(card->host->parent->driver->owner) in 
mmc_blk_alloc() in drivers/mmc/card/block.c the right thing to do? If 
so, I could provide a patch fixing the issue. If not, please give me 
advice how to do it better :) (May be I'm missing something that has to 
do with hotplugging, as the devices I'm using are non-removeable).
Or am I possibly doing something wrong in my host driver and this 
problem is not present for others at all?
Enrik
