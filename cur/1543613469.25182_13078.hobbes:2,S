BTW: the fsx test Dave Jones just pointed out pretty quickly fails on smbfs
on 2.4.8ac2 (mounting a share from NT4SP6a). I don't have anything never to
play with just now (1), but if you can't immediately reproduce it, I can
compile a newer kernel for the left over box and give it a longer whirl.

(1) I have a 2.4.16/ia64 on the corner, but fsx fails on IA64 with any fs
    ("mmap: Invalid argument"). Smbfs seems to work on ia64 otherwise...
