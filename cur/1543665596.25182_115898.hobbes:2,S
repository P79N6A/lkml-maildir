The different size types threw me, and I figured it
was a misplaced comment. It certainly made more sense
that way when it mentioned 'these three' rather than
'these four'.  looking at bd_acquire I'm not so sure
it's as simple a job as the other three were.

There still seems to be some users of that, so I'll
leave that to a follow up patch, (or someone else who
really knows whats going on there).
