We do on sane boxes where the APM BIOS informs us before suspending.
E.g., on my ASUS P3B-F & P4T-E suspend works with local APIC enabled
because I hooked both the NMI watchdog and local APIC to the
PM system, so we disable before suspending and restore afterwards.
The problem is that some BIOSen don't post the suspend event to
our APM driver, so we fail to disable before suspend, and some BIOSen
(like the utter crap Dell put in the Inspiron) die on all entries to
the BIOS: pull the power cord -> #SMM event -> box crashes.
