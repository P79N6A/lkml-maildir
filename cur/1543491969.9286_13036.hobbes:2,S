That's what he's saying, but you may have to do some manual editing of
.config.  For instance, if an option is grayed out in make xconfig, you
will probably have to edit .config and enable that option, to be able to
configure it thru xconfig/menuconfig/config.  That's how I configure my
kernels; saves much time over re-entering all the configuration stuff.
