If you search through my exchanges with Adrian Bunk WRT sk98lin removal, 
I mentioned a very similar problem. When I wrote that I had some notes 
in front of me, which are now archived and not quickly available. 
unloading and reloading the modules didn't fix it, IIRC.
I will be doing an update on the machine in question by the end of the 
year, and at that time I will try shy2 again, since I'll be able to do 
better testing.
