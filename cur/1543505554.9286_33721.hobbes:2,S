I think this function is superflous:
* on 64 bit platforms, it prevents the user from setting f_pos to values
which are not supported by ext2.
But the user could use sys_readp(), and then he can try to read/write such
data blocks.
--> protection can be bypassed, i.e. seems superflous.
* on 32 bit platforms, it prevents 32-bit wraparounds. I don't know if this
is required by POSIX, but if yes, then it belongs into default_llseek
[fs/file.c] since all fs are affected.
