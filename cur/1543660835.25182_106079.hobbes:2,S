I agree. Currently the VGA_MAP_MEM() hack does the trick in the vgacon.c,
but it would be a lot better to have a generic function.
However, I don't think that "isa_" prefix is good - as Ben pointed out,
legacy IO ranges of PCI devices like VGA, IDE, serial etc. can be
in other IO spaces than the real ISA bus.
What about
int pci_request_legacy_resource(struct pci_bus *bus, struct resource *res)
which would check res->flags and make appropriate decision?
The default in <linux/pci.h> for architectures like ia32 will be
#ifndef __HAVE_ARCH_LEGACY_REMAP
static inline int
pci_request_legacy_resource(struct pci_bus *bus, struct resource *res)
{
	struct resource *root = res->flags & IORESOURCE_IO ?
				&ioport_resource : &iomem_resource;
	return request_resource(root, res);
}
#infdef
This can be overridden in <asm/pci.h>.
Ivan.
