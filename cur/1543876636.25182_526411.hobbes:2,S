The main conceptual difference (in my mind) was not having one
bastardized data structure (pg_data_t) that meant different
things in different situations (is it a node, or a section
of discontig mem?). Also we didn't support discontig mem within
a node (at least with the old discontigmem), which was partly
the result of that hybridization.
Beyond that, it's just naming really.
