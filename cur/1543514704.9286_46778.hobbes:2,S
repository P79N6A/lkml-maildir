Hi Manfred,
I just got the 2.3.25 prepatch with your semaphore changes. That's a
great enhancement, but wouldn't it be better to include the per
semaphore lock into the semaphore structure instead of preallocating
it in the administration array?
I am just working on making the shm and sem limits sysctl'able. Here I
run into many inherent problems with these fixed size arrays:
You lock a lot of memory (and your patch doubles this locked memory)
If you kmalloc this you run into problems with high limits...
So I would suggest to invent a new structure
struct semid_kernel {
        spinlock_t lock;
        struct semid_ds u;
}
like we do for shm.
What do you think?
        Christoph
