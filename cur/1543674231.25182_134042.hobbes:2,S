The "unexpected" sutuation is when the RH process reads the old value
of uniq, just before the LH process sets it. Let's suppose that it
erroneously reads NULL, since that's what was set last, at the unlock
that lets the LH spinlock open up. That's OK, because it's not equal to
its own task identifier either, and that's the only special thing it's
looking for.
Umm ...  actually, the RH process could read uniq before the LH process
entered the spinlock.  If it were at that time equal to its own task
identifier, then chaos would ensue. But if it were so equal, then
the RH process would have the spinlock, since it's taken before setting
uniq. OK, I agree, there's no problem if the read doesn't blow up.
