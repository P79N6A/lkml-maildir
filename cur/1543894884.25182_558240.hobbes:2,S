Doens't matter for what?
To indicate what the Linux copyright holders meant?  Sure it doesn't.
I never claimed it did.
To indicate what the authors of the GPL meant?  To indicate the spirit
of the license they wrote?  Yes, it matters a lot.
And the latter is what my participation here is all about: to show
that the spirit didn't change at all.
Until you acknowledge and understand this, I should refrain from
answering your other postings.
