NFS does this (wait in D state) by default in order to prevent naive
applications from getting timeout errors that they're not equipped to
handle--the idea being that, if an NFS server goes down, programs
using it will simply freeze and recover once it returns, rather than
getting a timeout error and possibly becoming confused.
If you don't like this behavior, mount with 'soft' and/or 'intr'
options--see the manpage.
