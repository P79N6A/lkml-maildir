Well I applied your patch without the ones from Thomas Schlichter. Was 
is intended like that or should it be on top of Thomas patches?
I haven't tested thouroughly, but on the first impression your patch 
didn't make things really better, that's why I stoped testing. I just 
did following test:
Running prime95 as task taking 100% CPU) and started up mozilla and 
mailer. This took nearly endlessly. Deaktivating ACPI timer and things 
are fast again, ie. starting mozilla is like no background task is 
runnig. I dunno if it is a not 100% working patch or if it is Nick's 
scheduler, which I am using.
