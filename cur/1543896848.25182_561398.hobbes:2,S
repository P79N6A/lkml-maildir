Would it make sense to define a new entity called "configmenu" (or something
else) that is equivalent to menuconfig with the following changes?
 * it creates a CM_ variable instead of a CONFIG_ one
 * the CM_ symbols are not available to Makefiles or C files
   (so in fact, just to menuconfig and that they are listed in .config)
