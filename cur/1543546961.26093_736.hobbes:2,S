Alpha definitely needs mb(), ld_l/st_c doesn't imply any memory barrier
(yes, alpha is very aggressive in SMP 8).
Just to make a fun example if the virtual address of ld_l/st_c are
different but within the same 16bytes natuarlly aligned block you have to
put an mb() in __between__ ld_l/st_c to make sure that they are not
reordered and that none write happened in between from another CPU.
Here the docs about what I said:
[..]
	A processor executes a LDx_L/STx_C sequence and includes an MB
	between the LDx_L to a particular address and the successful STx_C
	to a different address (one that meets the constraints required
	for predictable behavior). That instruction sequence establishes
	an access order under which a store operation by another
	pro-cessor to that lock range occurs before the LDx_L or after the
	STx_C.
[..]
	If the address specified by a STx_C instruction does not match the one
	given in the preceding LDx_L instruction, an MB is required to guarantee
	ordering between the two instructions.
[..]
Then there's basically the asm spinlock implementation that is just like
our linux spin_lock/spin_unlock that does:
	"1:	ldl_l	%0,%1\n"
	"	blbs	%0,2f\n"
	"	or	%0,1,%0\n"
	"	stl_c	%0,%1\n"
	"	beq	%0,2f\n"
	"	mb\n"
and it adds the mb at the end as the linux spinlocks does and as the linux
test_and_set/clear_bit does too.
If ll/sc would imply a memory barrier we wouldn't need the mb at the end.
Then some other docs (it doesn't refer explicitly to ll/sc but it's quite
obvious they are included too).
[..]
	5.6.3 Implied Barriers
		There are no implied barriers in Alpha. If an implied
		barrier is needed for functionally correct access to
		shared data, it must be written as an explicit
		instruction. (Software must explicitly include any needed
		MB, WMB, or CALL_PAL IMB instructions.) Alpha transitions
		such as the following have no built-in implied memory
		barriers: " Entry to PALcode " Sending and receiving
		interrupts " Returning from exceptions, interrupts, or
		machine checks " Swapping context " Invalidating the
		Translation Buffer (TB) Depending on implementation
		choices for maintaining cache coherency, some
		PALcode/cache implementations may have an implied CALL_PAL
		IMB in the I-stream TB fill routine, but this is
		transparent to the non-PALcode programmer.

I think it's the other way around, I think it's simpler to not do any
magic barrier for that instructions from an hardware point of view. In the
alpha there's just a per cpu lock_flag and lock_physical_address
registers. ld_l set the lock_flag to 1 and sets the lock_physical_address
to the address that we want to monitor for changes from under us. Each
write or successful-write_conditional or wh64 (used for dropping not
interesting cachelines) that is run on the range of locked address on any
cpu will clear the lock flag for all the CPUs that wanted to monitor the
16byte block for changes. If the lock_flag is clear in the current cpu the
next st_c will fail. I think it's just an hardware logic (strightforwad
scalable and very efficient) that works indipendently of the speculative
read or write buffer parts of the cpu.
