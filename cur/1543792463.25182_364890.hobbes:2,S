Also account for an INT3 breakpoint potentially placed (from a kernel
debugger) on sysenter_entry, which requires the NMI handler to add one
more check. Further, don't discard debug or breakpoint traps/faults
happening on this one instruction and their handler getting
interrupted by an NMI before being able to fix the stack.
