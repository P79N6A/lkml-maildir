Hi,
I'm a tad confuzzled. I've just installed 2.2.11 (upgrade from 2.2.7) and am
getting the following errors when nfsing with a linux 2.0.36 box:
Aug 11 18:50:00 fishy kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 10.20.30.40
Aug 11 19:00:01 fishy kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 10.20.30.40
Aug 11 19:10:00 fishy kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 10.20.30.40
Aug 11 19:20:00 fishy kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 10.20.30.40
Aug 11 19:30:01 fishy kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 10.20.30.40
elm reports that:
Cannot flock folder "/var/spool/mail/root"! [No locks available]
And so I'm wondering how to fix this. As far as I know (from memory), lockd
faciliates file locking across NFS and that error means that it can't do
squat with the other nfs server. I'm also unsure if this was happening with
2.2.7 as I wasn't paying much attention to it then (and it crashed and burnt
horribly once which made me upgrade).
I've had a quick look through the NFS howto but as near as a search can tell
it doesn't even mention the word 'lockd' so I'm running along witht he 
presumption that it ain't gonna do squat for me. :) I looked in the linux
Documentation dir as well as the help available in menuconfig but not
much help there either. :/
Could someone help me here as I'm not quite sure what to do about this... :/
