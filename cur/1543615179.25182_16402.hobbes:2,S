What leads you to that conclusion?  There is nothing in the above 
paragraph that would lead you to believe that.

If used sans BIOS you need *massive* modifications to the setup anyway, 
and you're talking a completely custom kernel.  The reason to use the 
BIOS first is to give the platform vendor a hook to deal with 
platform-specific issues, and God knows there are plenty of those when 
it comes to A20.  (The fact that the BIOSes on the boards we have 
discussed haven't provided such a hook is a bug in itself.)
