No, there are no implicit sign-offs. The point of sign-offs is that it 
makes the copyright and flow of patches explicit, so an "implicit 
sign-off" would defeat the whole point.

Well, I just wanted an ack that it was tested, since it seemed a bit 
subtle and (like the sign-offs) that explicit "yes, this was tested" was 
missing. Looks like I was right in asking for it:

I'm perfectly happy with the attached patch, I just want it to be 
properly tested and have all the sign-offs (and explanations etc) in 
place, and I can apply it.
Of course, I cannot think of a single architecture where an EIP of ~0UL is 
valid anyway, so I'm also not opposed to just keeping ~0UL as the magic 
value.
