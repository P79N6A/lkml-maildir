Hi all
This may be a petite question but does anyone know what the variable 
"false_overrun" (in drivers/scsi/advansys.c) is meant for?
While converting the file to generic booleans I saw it is defined 
without value, can get the value of 'false' and then is used in an 
if-statement. So even if it is defined as 0 by default the if-statement 
is always false.
