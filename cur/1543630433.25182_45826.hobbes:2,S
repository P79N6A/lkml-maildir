Your errors are just like the ones I experienced due to an IDE bug.
Are you: 
a) using a hard-disk on the same cable as a CD/DVD
b) seeing any "hdX: status error: status=0x58 {DriveReady SeekComplete
DataRequest}" errors in your log
c) seeing (b) in close proximity to ATAPI module init messages like:
"hdb: ATAPI 24X DVD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache, UDMA(33)"
?
If yes to all/most of the above, you may be suffering from the same
bug.  If not, your inodes in RAM are probably being trashed by a
different bug :-))
