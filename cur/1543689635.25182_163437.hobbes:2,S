Having a full filesystem is generally a rare event.  And the actual size
difference between an extent tree based solution and a block tree solution
is usually quite small.  
And if it fails, well filesystems checkers are not required to succeed.
Safety wise it should be possible to allocate and probably even write
the entire block tree before the extent tree is removed so no data
should be lost.
Maybe downgrading is just silly but it is a nice option to have while
everything is still in development.  For the most part people seem to
be completely capable of making a back up and totally recreating a
filesystem as people have shown.  But if you are going to require that
what is the point of staying with the ext2 file format.
