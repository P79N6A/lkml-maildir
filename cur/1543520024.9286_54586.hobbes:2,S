The problem is that there are systems with *UNDEFINED* behavior on e820 and
e801 calls.  There is no configuration which 1) will not crash any machine
and 2) reports all memory on every machine.  When I say "crash" I mean with
possibly damaging side effects.
I believe this is why we were given config.in.  The only question then
becomes what settings to use as defaults.
BTW, even if it were not for this issue, the e820 data is too complex to
validate completely in setup.S.  We can do a little bit of sanity checking,
but that's all.
