i have released the -U9 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this too is a fixes-only release. It includes more driver fixes and
improvements from Thomas Gleixner.
Changes since -U8.1:
 - USB semaphore->completion conversion from Thomas Gleixner
 - netconsole fixes from Michal Schmidt
 - fbcon fixes
 - added counted semaphores, this is now used by firewire, XFS and ACPI. 
   This could fix the firewire breakage - but testing would be welcome.
 - PREEMPT_ACTIVE irqs-enabled critical path removal.
 - fixed irqs-off raw spinlock primitives on UP: they enabled irqs 
   before enabling preemption, creating a window for an interrupt to
   slip in and increase the critical path.
 - made the deadlock detector not crash the current process - it will
   just hang. This produces far nicer log output while still not
   endangering stability. Also, fixed a bug in the detector that happens 
   if the trace buffer overflows.
 - made the atomic-counter-underflow detector non-fatal as well, for the
   same reasons.
to create a -U9 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
