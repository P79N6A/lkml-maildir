Subject: [PATCH 3/5] mm: powerpc ptlock comments
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/21/298

Update comments (only) on page_table_lock and mmap_sem in arch/powerpc.
Removed the comment on page_table_lock from hash_huge_page: since it's
no longer taking page_table_lock itself, it's irrelevant whether others
are; but how it is safe (even against huge file truncation?) I can't say.
