Fair enough.  I agree that removing const is the only reasonable fix
right now.   But from semantics, const is a good thing, and people may
try to add it again later if we get rid of them now.  So, how about to
comment out such as /*const*/ in each place to remind that it's
intentional?
Also, in your patch to ice1712, you don't have to remove const from the
codes in snd_ice1712_read_eeprom() and snd_ice1712_probe() functions.
They should work as const pointer.
