	I imagine that would be annoying, but I think you are
misremembering.  Searching my mail since January 16, 2001, for
"NCR5380" and "53C80", I do not see any note remotely like that.
I don't think I have posted a patch or said anything about the
Linux scsi drivers on linux-kernel for years.
	Now that I am aware of your request regarding using the 2.4.18pre
version of the NCR driver for future maintenance of the 2.5 driver,
I am happy to follow it.
