Sir,
	Thank you for your prompt and informative response.

I believe it too.  Table 9-3 [I'd post it if it wasn't mangled]

Agreed as well per 9-3.  But if you write to an S line, it becomes E.

Agreed WT/UC loses performance, but maybe not much if only accessed
via spinlocks with their LOCK semantics.  For normal DRAM it's terrible!
My vision is a single 4kB kernel WT/UC page dedicated to spinlocks.
Setup isn't difficult, but administering the addresses might be.
Users would be on their own with WB spinlocks, or maybe the
kernel could serve one.

No kidding.  It seems like some 82443BX chips didn't like 16 bit
data reads (masking bit 0) and had to be read 32 bits.
