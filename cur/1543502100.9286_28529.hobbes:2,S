I think sysconf() is what you are looking for.
Pick a range of numbers to reserve for kernel use.
For example, 0x0a000000 to 0x0affffff would do.
Usage:    smp_num_cpus = sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF);
Try to get this correct too:
RETURN VALUE
       The  value returned is the value of the system resource, 1
       if a queried option is available, 0 if it is not, or -1 on
       error.  The variable errno is not set.
You must not ever return 0 for an error condition.
Errors are -1.

Obviously you haven't tried this in a cross-platform manner.
(or you wrote the libc 6 sysconf() hack and think your code works)
