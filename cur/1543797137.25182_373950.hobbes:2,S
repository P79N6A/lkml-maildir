Still no luck with it, I'm afraid: I've found no error in st.c,
beyond what the patch already fixed, to account for what you see.
I have noticed that struct st_buffer's unsigned char do_dio ought to be
unsigned short, in order to accommodate its maximum value of 256; but
that would not account for your symptoms, nor does taper approach that
maximum.
The symptoms are consistent with that do_dio field (near the start of
struct st_buffer) being corrupted, infrequently but repeatedly - the
same page has been mis-released three times before your first error
message.  But I see nothing wrong with st.c's handling of do_dio,
nor with get_user_pages' returned count.
So I think the best I can suggest is that you rebuild your kernel with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y, and see if that sheds any light.  And if you don't
mind doing so, advancing to 2.6.15-rc5 (which includes my patch) with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y would be even better: there's a chance it's a bug
that's already been fixed.  Though that won't really be proved if you
don't hit the problem, since the new kernel will be sufficiently
different that it might just have shifted the bug aside.
To be honest, the symptoms seem a little too regular to blame someone
overrunning their slab; but I've searched in vain and must move on.
