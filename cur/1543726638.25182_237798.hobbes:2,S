For PCI devices this is mostly defined by the parameter that says
what PCI power state to enter.  Even still-common "legacy" PCI
devices can basically fit into those definitions (though they may
not handle "low power" states other than "off").
Enabling remote wakeup is somewhat orthogonal.  Network
drivers have separate Wake-On-LAN calls, but that stuff should
arguably be part of the driver model PM framework.  Much of
the Linux PM work seems to be limited to "suspend when laptop
lid shuts, resume when it opens" ... which is a necessary start (one
that doesn't work universally yet either!) but not sufficient.

That was the first place I kept running into the deadlocks,
and I had to rewrite chunks of the OHCI driver to avoid
them.  The problem is that PM core uses a semaphore to
protect list membership, rather than a spinlock, and
that the semaphore is also trying to protect against more
than one thing at a a time.
