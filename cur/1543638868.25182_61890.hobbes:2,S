IO in 2.5 is much more CPU efficient that in 2.4, and straight-line
bandwidth is better as well.
The scheduling of that IO has a few problems, so in wildly seeky loads
like dbench the kernel still falls over its own feet a bit.  The
two main culprits here are the lock_buffer() in block_write_full_page()
against the blockdev mapping, and the writeback of dirty pages from the
tail of the LRU in page reclaim.
And no, the eventual dbench numbers will not be a measure of the success
of the tuning which will happen on the run in to 2.6.  Dbench throughput
may well be lower, because we probably should be starting writeback
at lower dirty thresholds.
If you want good dbench numbers:
