Is this written in a standard somewhere?  Is it guaranteed?
If some (perhaps non-gcc) compiler were to lay this out differently
(perhaps with suitable command-line options) then that's liveable
with - as long as the kernel never changes the layout.  Of course
it would be better to avoid this if poss.
The other potential issue with a structure like this is that there's a
risk that it will lead us to copy four bytes of uninitialised kernel
memory out to userspace.
IOW, it seems a generally bad idea to rely upon compiler-added padding
for this sort of thing.
