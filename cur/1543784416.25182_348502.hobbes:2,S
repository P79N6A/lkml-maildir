Ah. I'm not familiar with Dinakar's patches and how these domains
work. I'm actually more interested in this from the memory resource
control point of view, but these areas are of course somehow related.

Yes, that sounds like a good idea. But because English is not my
native language, I just want to reassure that we mean the same thing.
Non-overlapping subsets of cpu or memory nodes basically mean that
children of a cpuset only clear bits in the bitmap, never sets them.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Hm, I'm not sure how this relates to memory management, but you
probably need a place to store per-bit (node/cpu) guarantee count
regardless of memory or cpu resource control.
I think one major problem is how the guarantee should be divided
between all subcpusets that share one bit. And using one percent value
(or page count) per cpuset if more than 1 bit is set raises a similar
guarantee question.
One solution to the guarantee dividing problem could be to have a
percent value per bit set in the bitmap, maybe something like this:
# echo 0=50% > /dev/cpuset/foo/cpus

These "resource control domains", are they similar to your "meter"
suggestion earlier, or are they something else?

This boolean file, do you mean one of your "meter" files or something else?
Thank you for your comments!
