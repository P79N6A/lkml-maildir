The only reason I put it there is because the new PM code that I've been 
working on contains an abstraction layer and registration mechanism for 
the architecture-specific PM hooks (i.e. drivers for the low-level 
code), and it will contain the driver suspend/resume code. 
It seemed as good a place as any for it, though I personally don't have a
preference. Does anyone else care?
