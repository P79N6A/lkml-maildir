Please correct me if I am wrong, but ...
Task A					Task B					counter
call_module()										+1
schedule()											still 1
						unregister_callpoints()		still 1
						magic_wait_for_quiescence();	still 1
call_module_second_func() -> Won't work
So by trying to unregister a module you make a module unusable
for an unspecified amount of time.
