We're addressing that by blowing away the shadow cache and holding the 
big kvm lock to ensure SMP safety.  Not a great thing to do from a 
performance perspective but the whole point of patching is that the cost 
is amortized.

So then each module creates a hypercall page using this magic MSR and 
the hypervisor has to keep track of it so that it can appropriately 
change the page on migration.  The page can only contain a single 
instruction or else it cannot be easily changed (or you have to be able 
to prevent the guest from being migrated while in the hypercall page).
We're really talking about identical models.  Instead of an MSR, the #GP 
is what tells the hypervisor to update the instruction.  The nice thing 
about this is that you don't have to keep track of all the current 
hypercall page locations in the hypervisor.
