Your /dev/hda (IBM DeskStar 60GXP) is not in DMA mode because
you don't have support for your IDE controller compiled-in.
Going from 2.4.21 you have to explicitely enable support for IDE chipsets.
Assumption that current .config file will work with future kernel versions
is not true.  Please compile kernel with driver for your on-board IDE chipset
(I deducted from your dmesg that it is VIA82CXXX IDE driver).
Please report back if this cures your problem,
Thanks,
