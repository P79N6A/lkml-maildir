You need to think about this in a different way. Prezeroing only makes
sense if it can avoid using cache lines that the zeroing in the
hot paths would have to use since it touches all cachelines on
the page (the ppc instruction is certainly nice and avoids a cacheline
read but it still uses a cacheline!). The zeroing in itself (within the
cpu caches) is extraordinarily fast and the zeroing of large portions of
memory is so too. That is why the impact of scrubd is negligible since
its extremely fast.
The point is to save activating cachelines not the time zeroing in itself
takes. This only works if only parts of the page are needed immediately
after the page fault. All of that has been documented in earlier posts on
the subject.
