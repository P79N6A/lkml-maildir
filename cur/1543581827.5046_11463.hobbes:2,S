2.4.1-ac11 creates repeatedly the following error messages on my box:
kernel: VM: killing process crond      (or any other process)
kernel: VM: Bad swap entry 0000e200    (variable addresses)
for example in intervals of about 5 to 10 seconds. This is on a notebook, AMD
K6-433, 64megs RAM,  VIA MVP4 chipset (VT8501 revision 3), Bus Master revision
6; didn't get these errors with the 2.4.1-ac6 patch which I ran before.
