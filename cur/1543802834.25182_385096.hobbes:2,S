Yep, this is probably a known problem with recent changes to the
'barrier' code.
Try to convince md not to use barrier by changing md_super_write in
drivers/md/md.c.  Simply remove
	if (!test_bit(BarriersNotsupp, &rdev->flags)) {
		struct bio *rbio;
		rw |= (1<<BIO_RW_BARRIER);
		rbio = bio_clone(bio, GFP_NOIO);
		rbio->bi_private = bio;
		rbio->bi_end_io = super_written_barrier;
		submit_bio(rw, rbio);
	} else
leaving the
		submit_bio(rw, rbio);
which comes after it.
