Hi Trond,

Our error (this patch was wrong) - you are right we should use FMODE_READ.

Justification: Linus asked me to.  He said, there is only intent data for
open really so please remove the union.  I don't particularly care.

Well spotted.  This is only used during the last component of lookup, so we
don't much care about this as we travers intermediate path names.  Have I
missed something else here?

Clever, we will do that.

Didn't know this flag was there, we will use FS_REVAL_DOT.
Oleg Drokin is reworking the patches for these issues.
Thanks, this simplifies things!
