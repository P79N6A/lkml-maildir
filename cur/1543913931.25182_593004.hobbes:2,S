The impression I got at vm meeting was that SLUB was good to go :(

It is trivial to test SLUB vs SLAB independently of the scheduler change.
And actually, a scheduler regression here might just never be fixed,
because it is likely to be a higher level thing where the scheduling just
happens not to interact with tbench so well (and either it would be
impossible to find out why, or no point tuning the scheduler for such a
case).
But slab allocations don't really control the macro behaviour of a
benchmark like that so much. So don't wait until something happens
with the scheduler, fix it now.
Yay, looks like we'll get yet more logic in the VM to polish the proverbial
turd that is higher order allocations :P
