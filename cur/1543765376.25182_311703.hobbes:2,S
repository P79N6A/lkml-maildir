Think of it the following way: user suspend and later resumes. During
suspend some mlocked memory e.g. from ssh-agent gets dumped to swap.
Some days later the system gets broken in from a remote place.
Unfortunately the ssh keys are still on swap (assuming that ssh-agent is
not running then) and can be recovered by the intruder. The intruder can
then gain access to other sites with the data recovered from the earlier
suspend.
You see, it is not a matter of having encrypted swap, what matters here
is what suspend needs to write to swap and this can be stuff that does
not belong there so it needs to be erased after resume. And the easiest
way to do this is to encrypt the suspend image with a temporary key that
gets cleared on resume.
If you don't resume mkswap will also clear the key though i have to
admit that there's a small window then in which the key and data are
still accessible.
