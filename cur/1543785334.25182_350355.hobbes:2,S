Dang, this leaked in from 3/5, and 1/5 also has some funny
whitespace I introduced.
They'll all still apply just fine, and the end result will
look the same, so they're fine for testing and comments.
I'll submit cleaned up and signed off versions if/when we're
ready (speaking of which, David I should get you to sign
this as well if you agree with it)
