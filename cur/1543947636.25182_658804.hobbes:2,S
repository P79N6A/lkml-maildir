This is not accurate. Sysprof started by me adding a hierarchical call
view to speedprof, a SIGPROF profiler which was basically a hack in
memprof.
Oprofile did not work on my system at the time (Red Hat 9, I believe),
and the website said that I had to apply a patch to the kernel and
recompile, so I didn't try it.
The hierarchical call view in speedprof worked out so well that I
wrote a simple kernel module to produce system-wide stacktraces, and
fed them into speedprof. Since speedprof was just a hack in memprof, I
wrote a new GUI, and sysprof was born.
It was only later I tried oprofile and found it not only much more
difficult to use, but also much less useful when I did get it to work.
