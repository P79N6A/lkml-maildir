Hi,
there is a slight problem with `make config` (oldconfig, silentoldconfig).
By the time we get to the
  Netfilter Xtables support (required for ip_tables) 
  (NETFILTER_XTABLES) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) m
part, CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CONNMARK is for example not offered 
because it depends on IP_NF_MANGLE which can be selected later. It is 
therefore impossible to select CONNMARK without having to go through config 
twice. In case of automated scripts, this means that CONNMARK remains 
unselected unless special actions were taken.
