Tsi108 bridge is designed for powerpc platform. Originally, I use
out_be32() and in_be32(). While there is no obvious reason to object
using this bridge in a little endian system. Maybe some extra hardware
logic needed for the bus interface. le32_to_cpu() can  be aware the
endian difference.
Any comment?

I will modify the name.
