Thanks!
You're right, it is intrusive in a way that it does modify the way gcc can
optimize that section of code.  But what I like about this idea, is that
it allows for us to tell gcc that we want this variable inside a register,
and then gcc can do that for us and still optimize around that. We put no
more constraints on the code, except that we want some value in a
register at some given point of execution.  This should only be done for
local variables that are not easily captured in a probe.
Of course with i386's limit on registers, it can put a little strain if we
want more than one variable. But x86_64 will soon be the norm, and the
added registers should help out a lot.
