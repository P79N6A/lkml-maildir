The only point of BH_New was to not need this horror in three different
places, and have the BH_New bit as a way of saying "this buffer has no
contents yet", and fill it with zeroes in just _one_ place (ie the
readpage path).
However, I don't think it was ever implemented, so if you prefer the
straightforward (brute-force but ugly) approach, just get rid of it.
