I did it about a month ago, when guys had problems with fput()-type races
(I've found a bunch of that stuff in the arch/*, but their problem was
outside of the main kernel - iBCS). It took two weeks and was not a
pleasant job ;-/ I believe that I've kept the records. The bottom line:
we ought to do struct file layer first, since dcache and inode layers are
much more convoluted. The worst offenders are RPC-type schedulers in
network file systems, mostly due to the fact that they do not bypass the
struct file layer. I believe that they should go straight to sockets - it
would simplify the life big way.

	If by 'compatibility thing' you mean atomic_inc() - yes,
it can be trivially removed. No problem. But distinction between the
forced and lazy semantics on fput() is needed - think of kernel threads.
BTW, maybe we need a generic AST-type thing for that kind of stuff.
