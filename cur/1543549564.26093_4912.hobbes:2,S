2.4.0-test8-vm3 seems quite stable with this CVS of X
After running xawtv and gqmpeg ...which would quickly die due to shm
being maxed .. it still works and shows ~ 839 segments ..not really
moving from it
And after 20 min with all the apps i had open before, still not in
swap.  Which on test9, i would be ~50MB into swap. . and shortly around
an hour 90MB
Something is wrong with test9 or the interaction with test9 and X
