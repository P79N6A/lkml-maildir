There are two problems, first breaking procfs field name for no good reason 
(you can name x86 features as 'flags' and amd/cyrix/...
as you named... There is certainly fewer apps which search 'flags'
for AMD feature than apps which search 'flags' for x86 feature;
you can also emulate old flags field by merging all features together,
but I'm not asking for this).
Second problem is that I know no system which has /dev/cpu/*/* file.
Maybe it is just my problem...
But if you could modify cpuid/msr registration interface so that they'll
appear on my /devfs, it would be much nicer. Currently there is only 
'microcode' and 'mtrr' in /devfs/cpu, and no 0,1 subdirectories...
