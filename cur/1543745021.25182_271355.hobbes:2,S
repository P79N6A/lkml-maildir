No, that is obfuscation and has nothing to do with this. The cast I
mentioned is _redudant_ because the common case is:
         struct foo * f = (struct foo *) priv; /* priv is void pointer */
And the cast gives you absolutely zero benefit in terms of
readability. For arithmetic types, you use casts to be explicit about
different conversions, but for void pointers there's only one
conversion which makes sense and that's what the standard guarantees.

I vote for the established kernel coding style.
