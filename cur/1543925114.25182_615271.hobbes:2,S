Like this?
It gets messy.
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
David Brown points out that compat_sys_times() (and sys_times()) can return
arbitrary 32-bit (or 64-bit values).  If these happen to be negative (jiffy
wrap, or before INITIAL_JIFFIES) then libc will interpret this as an error and
will return -1 to the libc user and will set errno.
The manpage for times(2) says:
       times()  returns  the  number of clock ticks that have elapsed since an
       arbitrary point in the past.  For Linux 2.4 and earlier this  point  is
       the  moment  the  system  was  booted.   Since Linux 2.6, this point is
       (2^32/HZ) - 300 (i.e., about 429 million) seconds  before  system  boot
       time.   The  return  value  may  overflow  the  possible  range of type
       clock_t.  On error, (clock_t) -1 is returned, and errno is  set  appro-
       priately.
We can fix this by masking the return value down to a 31-bit (63-bit) value.
Also, let's correct for INTIAL_JIFFIES - this isn't a detail which should be
exposed to userspace.
Unfortunately this change can break userspace.  If a program was (correctly)
doing:
	unsigned long start = times(...);
	...
	unsigned long end = times(...);
	unsigned long delta = end - start;
then `delta' can be grossly wrong if we wrapped in the interval.  Instead
userspace will need to mask `delta' by 0x7fffffff (0x7fffffffffffffff) to get
the correct number.
But userspace was already busted in the presence of wraparound, due to glibc's
convert-to-negative-one behaviour.
Given all this stuff, the return value from sys_times() doesn't seem a
particularly useful or reliable kernel interface.
