BTW, I would leave ->psm is wire order; we compare it to ->l2_psm from
sockaddr_l2 a lot, so putting a conversion there looks odd.
Note that we do pass ->ls_psm to __l2cap_sock_by_addr(), so I'm not sure
if I like the idea of host-endian ->sport; we would need to slap a conversion
there as well.
See also
                bacpy(&bt_sk(sk)->src, &la->l2_bdaddr);
                l2cap_pi(sk)->psm   = la->l2_psm;
                l2cap_pi(sk)->sport = la->l2_psm;
                sk->sk_state = BT_BOUND;
for other place where net-endian gets there.
Are you sure that you want both to be switched to host-endian?
