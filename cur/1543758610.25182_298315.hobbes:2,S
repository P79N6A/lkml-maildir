Subject: [PATCH] Bad page state mapcount
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/1/193

A small change to the tests for "Bad page state", to avoid one class of
the page_remove_rmap BUG reports, giving more information while letting
the system continue: check page_mapcount (_mapcount != -1) rather than
page_mapped (_mapcount >= 0).
And how does _mapcount go bad?  In the case under study, it looks sure
now that an overheating(?) Pentium III sometimes gets confused by a pair
of instructions in the no-buddy-bitmap __free_pages_bulk, and clears the
PG_private bit from the _mapcount field while buddying around - changing
PG_private value changes the bit cleared from _mapcount.  Bad page state
mapcount:-4096 would have tracked this down much sooner, and will be
recognizable if other cpus show the same aberrant reaction to 2.6.11.
The page_remove_rmap BUG does need to be replaced by more permissive and
informative handling, but I'm not yet ready to to finalize such a patch.
Please admit Colin Harrison to the Order of the Iridescent Penguin,
for his tireless testing.
