This part of the errors alone is useless.

Did you manually change your gcc link or are you using gcc 3.3 ?

Other people already do similar things.
The interesting thing is the exact error message. Your 5 errors are 
actually only two (similar) compile errors.
For being really useful, a posting of the error messages of the two 
actual error messages would be useful. If you trace down who is "guilty" 
for the compile error and Cc the person in question it's even better 
(but please check linux-kernel before being the tenth person reporting 
the same issue).
