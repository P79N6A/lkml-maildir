What I can say is that compiler will consider the construct like
(struct foo *)  as this (struct foo)* will be making compiler confused
that (struct foo) is type-casting and the * might be for deferencing
the pointer but as * is also in a bracket and wont follow any pointer
thats why compiler is giving error. (CMIIW)
