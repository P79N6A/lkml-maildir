Incredible. 
I was sure I was out of look with the aged vmware 3.2.0, and now suddenly
there is patch for both the kernel and the application :).

I didn't even realize 2242 had been released ;). (As I said, I've lately
been using vmware less and less.)
I just upgraded to 2242 + any2any82 and it works fine (*). I'm still using
the 2.6.8.1-mm2 with the updated dev-mem restriction patch. I'll retest this
as soon as I get to upgrade my kernel again to something that doesn't
contain Arjan's new dev-mem patch. I'll let you know.
*) Apart from that even 3.2.1 2242 does not fix the altgr key that does not
   seem to work with 2.6 new input system. I presume the new input layer is
   the reason; I do know altgr used to work with 2.4 host kernel and winxp
   guest.
