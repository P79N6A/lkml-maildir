Oooo, good!
The Adapter has declared itself `dead' (maybe for reasons other than a
controlled blinkLED situation). Effectively a crash or complete loss of
communications with the Adapter. Last time I've seen this happened it
was a bad power supply.
Contact technical support to have them narrow down the actual cause of
adapter failure ... I don't know where the F/W updates are held on the
Dell Site.

Turns out I spoke too soon. I repeated the rsync and logged this
information
from the serial console:
aacraid: Host adapter reset request. SCSI hang ?
aacraid: Host adapter appears dead -3
SCSI error : <1 0 0 0> return code = 0x6000000

FYI, I have another [production] server sitting next to this one running
aacraid and so far it hasn't had any problems. It's a PowerEdge 2450,
unsure as
to which PercRaid device it has. So now I'm comparing two systems:
Production: PowerEdge 2450, aacraid driver (1.1.2-lk1), PERCRAID Mirror,
Unknown HW
   AAC0: kernel 2.1.4 build 2951
   AAC0: monitor 2.1.4 build 2951
   AAC0: bios 2.1.0 build 2951
   AAC0: serial 73840ad0fafaf001
and
Development: PowerEdge 2400, aacraid driver (1.1-5[2345]), PERC RAID5,
Perc 2/Si
   AAC0: kernel 2.1-3 build 2939
   AAC0: monitor 2.1-3 build 2939
   AAC0: bios 2.1-3 build 2939
   AAC0: serial 58801d0
Thing I noticed is that the firmware build on my Development server (the
one
that's crashing) is older. Where can I find a firmware upgrade? I've
been
scouring Dell's site the last 20 minutes and all I can find are Linux
drivers.

I'm going to run the above test right now and let you know how it turns
out.
Just for some history, I've been running 2.4 kernels on this machine for
2
years and haven't had a problem with the aacraid driver. Also, the
default
Fedora Core 2 install I had on it yesterday seems to also work
flawlessly too,
and it's a 2.6.5-smp system.
