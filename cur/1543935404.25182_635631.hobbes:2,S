It wasn't about clone makers speeding up their busses. The ISA bus
originally ran at the CPU clock - 4.77/8/6/10 .. etc. Quite a few board
makers assumed 8MHz and while faster isn't a big problem at 8bit trying
to do the 8/16 bit decode with logic chips at 8MHz is quite tight and
above that generally broke. 8bit tends to work fine because you've got a
lot more timing headroom.

It is about supporting this properly. Properly for ISA devices means
using I/O delays. Properly for chipset devices is probably using udelay.

Linux runs on x86, it isn't limited to PC type architectures at all. We
don't need a BIOS, we don't need legacy compatible I/O devices.

No point. We've got the 64bit kernel for that. That is a much saner
boundary to throw out all the nutty stuff.
