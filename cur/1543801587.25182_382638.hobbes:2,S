Chuck,
To my surprise, applying the same fix to the x86_64 does not
solve the problem on my Opteron box. I verified that the
offset (144) matches with what the kernel is expecting.
Somehow the RF is lost or not set in the proper location.
I cannot make forward progress once I reach the breakpoint.
Is there something else to on x86_64?
Thanks.
