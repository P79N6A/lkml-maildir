You send:
- a problem description X
- tell that the last working kernel was Y
- tell that it is broken in kernel Z
The probability of any kernel developer being interested in your problem 
increases:
- the better the description X is
- the nearer versions Y and Z are together
- the more recent version Y is
Ideally, you are able to say that patch A in the latest -mm kernel
broke it.
It's perfectly OK to send a description X that says:
- with version Y and the following workload B, everything is working
  perfectly
- with version Z and the same workload B, XMMS is stuttering
If any kernel developer is interested in your bug report, he will tell 
you which data might be interesting for debugging the problem.
The problem is that debugging a problem often requires knowledge about 
possible causes and changes between versions Y and Z in this area. Even 
a kernel developer who perfectly knows one part of the kernel might not 
be able to debug a problem in a completely different area of the kernel.
