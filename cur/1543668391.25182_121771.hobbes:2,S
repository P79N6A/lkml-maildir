I get that. I can talk with the driver vendor. But to gain the usefulness of 
caculation of CSUM in HW we need to disable the software CSUM calculation in 
TCP layer in the kernel. Am I correct? I am trying to find that and I ma 
stuck there. How to disble the software TCP CSUM calculation? and later I 
can talk with driver vendor to enable it in hardware. I wanted help from 
linux gurus in disabling TCP csum calculation in the kernel.
Thanking You
Shesha
