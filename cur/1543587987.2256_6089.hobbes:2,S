No.

As far as I can see, you cannot guarantee that an inode which is unlocked
_and_ clean (accordingly to the inode->i_state) is safely on disk.
The reason for that are calls to sync_one() which write the inode
asynchronously: 
sync_one(struct inode *inode, int sync) {
...
        dirty = inode->i_state & I_DIRTY;
        inode->i_state |= I_LOCK;
        inode->i_state &= ~I_DIRTY;
        spin_unlock(&inode_lock);
        filemap_fdatasync(inode->i_mapping);
        /* Don't write the inode if only I_DIRTY_PAGES was set */
        if (dirty & (I_DIRTY_SYNC | I_DIRTY_DATASYNC))
                write_inode(inode, sync);               <-------------
        filemap_fdatawait(inode->i_mapping);
        spin_lock(&inode_lock);
        inode->i_state &= ~I_LOCK;
        wake_up(&inode->i_wait);
}
The fs-specific write_inode() function will simply "generate" the dirty
buffer_head and add it to the dirty list.  After that, it unlocks the
inode.  
Where is the guarantee that this dirty buffer head has hitted the disk?
Do you see what I mean now ?
I don't see a clean "for 2.4" fix except writting the inode
unconditionally at _each_ call which needs to write the inode
synchronously.
