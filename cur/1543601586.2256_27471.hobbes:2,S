I just built a 2.4.8 kernel with the APIC enabled.  It locked
hard and printed no OOPS.  I had set the boot cmd line as:
nmi_watchdog=1

When I opened the machine the first time (before I powered it up),
I noticed that the CPU fan's wires were tangled in the fan such that
it couldn't move..  I fixed that, but it could have been run before
I received the machine...  Could that cause this problem you think??
Thanks,
