Agreed. This check uglifies the code to fix the theoretical problem.
But, actually do_each_pid_task() is a bit ugly even without this check.
Lets forget about this check for a moment.
Firstly, all hlist_for_each_entry() helpers should be "fixed", we don't
need the second argument. For example, hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() could
be
	#define hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(pos, head, member)			\
		for (pos = (void*)(head)->first; rcu_dereference(pos) && ({	\
			prefetch(((struct hlist_node*)pos)->next);		\
			pos = hlist_entry((void*)pos, typeof(*pos), member); 1;	\
		     }); pos = (void*)(pos)->member.next)
So we can define
	#define for_each_pid_task(pid, type, task)
		for (task = pid ? (void*)((pid)->tasks + type)->first : NULL;			\
			rcu_dereference(task) && ({						\
			prefetch(((struct hlist_node*)task)->next);				\
			task = hlist_entry((void*)task, typeof(*task), pids[type].node); 1;	\
		     }); task = (void*)(task)->pids[type].node.next)
Which can be used just
	for_each_pid_task(pid, type, task)
		do_something(task);
Not that I think it is worth to do, though ;)
We can even restore the ugly special case for PIDTYPE_PID:
	#define for_each_pid_task(pid, type, task)
		for (task = pid ? (void*)((pid)->tasks + type)->first : NULL;			\
			rcu_dereference(task) && ({						\
			prefetch(((struct hlist_node*)task)->next);				\
			task = hlist_entry((void*)task, typeof(*task), pids[type].node); 1; })	\
		     task = (type != PIDTYPE_PID) ? (void*)(task)->pids[type].node.next : NULL)

Yes,

Personally, I think you are right. But then we should change IOPRIO_WHO_USER
accordingly, imho.
