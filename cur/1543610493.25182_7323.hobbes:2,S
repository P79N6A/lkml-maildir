Hey, this gives Linus a good reason to make another 2.4.15 release,
and silence all of the people complaining about -greased-turkey (which,
as we all know, was Linus' prerelease for testing that everything was
working OK before he made an _official_ 2.4.15 release, and a good thing
he did or this bug wouldn't have shown up until the _official_ 2.4.15
release which would have been embarassing ;-).
Cheers, Andreas
