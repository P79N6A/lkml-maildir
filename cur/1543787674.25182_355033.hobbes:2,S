But it is ok to do do_wait(WSTOPPED /* without WNOWAIT */) for TASK_TRACED
child. wait_task_stopped() does not actually wait, it just eats ->exit_code.

It can be child of other thread in our thread group (do_wait() iterates
over all threads ->children lists) and that thread can do PTRACE_DETACH.
But this does not matter.

I still think that checking p->state here just pointless and confusing.
The task was TASK_STOPPED or TASK_TRACED on entering, we have WNOWAIT
flag, we should just call wait_noreap_copyout(). And 'p' can change it's
->state just after the check.
And I think that wait_task_stopped() should get ->exit_code and ->si_code
atomically under tasklist_lock, p->ptrace can be changed after we dropped
that lock.
Btw,
do_wait():
	case TASK_STOPPED:
		if (!(options & WUNTRACED) && !my_ptrace_child(p))
			continue;
Looks like it should be '||' here?
Oleg.
