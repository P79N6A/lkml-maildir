So that was what i just did. I removed the board from the blacklist, 
recompiled the kernel and booted.
The kernel started and there were some issues with the interrupt 
routing. I don't remember the exact messages but i could post a dmesg if 
you like.
With "pci=noapci" the computer hang upon loading the kernel module for 
the SCSI controller. I remember that to be an issue too when i had 
windows2k installed on that box but i could "fix" that by changing the 
IRC setting in the BIOS. Changing those settings didn't help Linux to boot.
At first sight ACPI (without pci=noacpi) seemed to work but pressing the 
power button didn't generate any events although the power button was 
detected properly during boot.
After all i think i know why P2B-S and -DS are blacklisted. The board 
with on-board SCSI controller are messed up somehow.
I haven't tried to install BIOS 1014beta3 yet. BIOS 1014beta2 is 
currently installed but i guess the update won't solve anything.
With acpi=ht it works for now, but doesn't acpi=ht imply pci=noacpi?
