I checked out the kernel autoirq for COM3 and COM4 on standard IO
addresses a while back, when 2.0.35 was current, and even on systems
where the hardware was set to irq's that conflicted with other
hardware in the system, it ALWAYS got the IRQ correct, and NEVER
locked one of those systems up.
Because of this, I proposed a patch that enabled the autoirq feature
for these two ports. It was rejected by the maintainer, Ted Ts'o, on
the grounds that enabling autoirq for HUB6 and the AST FourPort cards
(neither of which were affected by my patch) could result in the
kernel locking the system up.
I tried to point out to Ted that my patch did not touch support for
any of the cards he claimed to be worried about, but found Ted less
than interested in that fact. As a result, I will be rather surprised
to hear that any such patch has been accepted, unless it was submitted
by Linus himself.
Since the serial probing is done differently in the 2.2.x kernels, I'm
not planning on resubmitting my patch, and I'm also not planning on
wasting my time developing an equivalent patch for the 2.2.x kernels.
Best wishes from Riley.
