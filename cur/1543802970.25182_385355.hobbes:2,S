Btw, when doing the "From:" thing, I'd really prefer the email address 
too, so that it ends up in the author field.
In fact, if there is nothing that looks like an email address, my patch 
application scripts will ignore this "From:" in the body of the mail, and 
use the From: from the headers (now, in this case it obviously is the 
right thing to do, but if somebody else passes the email on to me, it 
would result in you not being properly credited as author for the commit, 
although the commit _message_ would then have that "From:" line in it).
Having an email address in the authorship data is just too convenient (ie 
something goes wrong with the change, and we need to contact the author or 
similar).
