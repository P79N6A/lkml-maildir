People are always quick to state as fact things that they have
not looked into.  I don't know what the current status is on
this, but as I understand it, trampolines work with these
patches.  This is all an FAQ.  I've read this thread 40 times in
3 years.  Why don't we all start another thread equally as
annoying on:
1) The use of goto in kernel sources?
2) Splitting up the kernel into several modular tarballs by arch,
   etc..?
3) Binary only modules..
All equally annoying, and equally pointless.  All FAQ's.
