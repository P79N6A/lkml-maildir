Change the name. AI has a bad touch, as if things would happen
through magic. A neural is magic to me, but most other AI techniques
are quite predictable.
A rule-based system can be evaluated quite efficiently if the numer of 
rules are reasonable small. A PC can a million of "LIPS" (logical Inferences
per second so you can fit something useful. Say you can afford (on
average one percent of the CPU, that becomes 10000 inferences per
second available per second and with 50 switches pers second that is 2000
inferences per switch. I think can do useful rules with much fewer inferences.
The numbers are guestimates from memory and a few quick googles lookups.
The problem might be efficient collection of useful input to the rules. On the other
hand everything does not have to be recalculated every time the scheduler
makes a decision.
You can split the rules into 1) switching decision making rules 2) strategy selection rules
and 3) environment evaluation rules. The first category of course has to evaluated
every time, while the last set can be a slow process that looks at swapping and I/O
statistics over time withe a recation time on the order of a second. The second is
for simplifying the structure of the rules (might be redundant).
A benefit of a rule based scheduler could be as a good test bed for experimentation.
Changes could be implemented in "real time" (from a user perspective) I.e. you 
change the rule and the  scheduler immediately changes its behaviour. And the scheduler would
be more customizable to the end user or administrator. You could try out
rules for identifying interactive tasks, CPU hogs and tell the scheduler what
/you/ think is importan instead of the one-size-fits-all.
The idea is not bad unless someone proves it. On the other hand its useless
unless manifested in code.
