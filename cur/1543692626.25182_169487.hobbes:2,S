| Why do I need this for a moduleless kernel?
arch/i386/boot/Makefile for 'make install' runs arch/i386/boot/install.sh.
This latter script runs /sbin/installkernel or ~/bin/installkernel.
You (user) control the latter one (if present).
Your distro controls the former one, so I can't say what's in your
system's /sbin/installkernel file.
In my /sbin/installkernel, I can see that using it with a "-i"
option tells it not to generated initrd files.
YMMV.
