Subject: [PATCH] 2/6: basic 64 bit jiffies uses
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/5/11/39

Two simple uses of 64 bit jiffies:
  - export correct uptime through sysinfo after 32 bit jiffies wrap.
    Note that this does not change the ABI, which exports uptime in seconds.
    It just prevents internal overflow.
  - use 64 bit jiffies in the OOM-killer. Before, deaemons and very
    long-running jobs were likely to be killed in OOM situations after
    jiffies wrap.
The uptime exported through /proc/uptime will be corrected in patch 5/6.
