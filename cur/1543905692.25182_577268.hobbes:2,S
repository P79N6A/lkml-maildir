To be precise, I think the rule should be that if some code is needed for
anything else than suspend/hibernation, it should be under plain CONFIG_PM.
Still, if something is only needed for suspend/hibernation, it should go under
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP or CONFIG_SUSPEND/HIBERNATION, depending on what it's needed
for.
Now, AFAICS, for the majority of drivers .suspend() and .resume() are only
needed for suspend/hibernation and really should be used for suspending
only (some other callbacks are needed for hibernation).

At least one more, for hibernation.
That also depends on what approach to the runtime power management is widely
accepted.  For now, USB is in the vanguard. :-)
