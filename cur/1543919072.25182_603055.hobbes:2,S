No, nothing cute in udev itself, but it seems that all distros that I
know of have a "load these modules now" type setting in their init
scripts that can be used here.
I can't think of a way to enforce this load order on the modules
themselves due to the fact that OHCI might not even be needed for EHCI
devices on UHCI (Intel) based chipsets :(
Can anyone else?
