You appear terminally confused. The purpose of the GPL as defined by its
authors is not commercial success, world domination or making zillions of
dollars - it is keeping the software protected by that license "free" in
terms of liberty as measured against the set of freedoms to
run/modify/etc they discuss in the licence document.
The fact this is a good license for making zillions of dollars, producing
good software and the like is either incidental or a logical result of the
protection of freedoms depending upon which views you believe.
