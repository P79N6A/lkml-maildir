In the 2.4 days people had to do 'make clean' very often.
For the 2.6 kernel this is no longer needed, so when cleaning up
we want to be effective.
.version only really pays off when doing a lot of consecutive
build on the _same_ kernel src.
And make clean is often used in combination with kernel patching,
especially when renaming files: mv mm/slab.c.old mm/slab.c for example.
Here we start over with some new src, so it make sense to start over
with the version?
