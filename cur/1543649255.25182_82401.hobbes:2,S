Feel free to disregard my viewpoint since I'm involved in the debate,
but if the only thing I ever did on this list was to post about how BK
is great, the license is great, and you are all nuts unless you use BK,
I'd expect to get blacklisted pretty darn fast.
It's not a free speech issue, it's a question of whether this is the place
for that sort of discussion.  We could discuss pro-choice vs pro-life here
as well but we don't, this isn't the place for it.
