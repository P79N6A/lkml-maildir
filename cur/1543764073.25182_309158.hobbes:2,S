The pause is actually generated by the device, probably to make single
step scrolling easier.

That's a problem with xbindkeys. Without xbindkeys, the X events are
(p = press, r = release)
        p 11/12, p 4/5, r 4/5, ( <pause>, ( p 4/5, r 4/5 )* )?, r 11/12
As the 11/12 events are a bit annoying (Mozilla, but not Firefox,
interprets them as a left click), I use xbindkeys to bind them to
nothing.  But xbindkeys seems to have problems with the press 11/12
and release 11/12 events being interrupted by 4/5 events, it eats
everything before the pause =>
        ( <pause>, ( p 4/5, r 4/5 )* )?, r 11/12

For horizontal scrolling I see:
p 6/7, r 6/7, ( <pause>, ( p 6/7, r 6/7 )* )?
That's OK with me.  If vertical scrolling would work the same way
(ie. without the additional 11/12 events), I'd be happy.
Anyhow, this looks a problem with X not the kernel.  evtest shows that
the device reports similar event sequences for tilting the wheel and
the cruise control buttons.
E.g. scrolling left by tilting the wheel:
,----
| Event: time 1112723029.967722, type 1 (Key), code 280 (?), value 1
| Event: time 1112723029.967729, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
| Event: time 1112723029.983709, type 2 (Relative), code 6 (HWheel), value -1
| Event: time 1112723029.983715, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
| Event: time 1112723030.359712, type 2 (Relative), code 6 (HWheel), value -1
| Event: time 1112723030.359719, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
| Event: time 1112723030.463706, type 2 (Relative), code 6 (HWheel), value -1
| Event: time 1112723030.463715, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
| Event: time 1112723030.551708, type 1 (Key), code 280 (?), value 0
| Event: time 1112723030.551712, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
`----
and scrolling down with the cruise controll button:
,----
| Event: time 1112723159.628081, type 1 (Key), code 279 (?), value 1
| Event: time 1112723159.628090, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
| Event: time 1112723159.644084, type 2 (Relative), code 8 (Wheel), value -1
| Event: time 1112723159.644091, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
| Event: time 1112723160.020068, type 2 (Relative), code 8 (Wheel), value -1
| Event: time 1112723160.020075, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
| Event: time 1112723160.124067, type 2 (Relative), code 8 (Wheel), value -1
| Event: time 1112723160.124075, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
| Event: time 1112723160.212060, type 1 (Key), code 279 (?), value 0

Note the 280 and 279 events at the start and end.
