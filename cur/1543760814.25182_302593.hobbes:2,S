while writing the ->break_lock feature i intentionally avoided overhead
in the spinlock fastpath. A better solution for the bug you noticed is
to clear the break_lock flag in places that use need_lock_break()
explicitly.
One robust way for that seems to be to make the need_lock_break() macro
clear the flag if it sees it set, and to make all the other (internal)
users use __need_lock_break() that doesnt clear the flag. I'll cook up a
patch for this.
