Handling this is my ultimate aim with my configuration manager. As well as the
standard four types of resource token (irq, dma, io & mem), I'd like to be
able to have drivers put up other types (such as a SCSI device token or a
parallel device token, though some generic type of indirection token may be
better).
This would, say, allow the following drivers:
	* a "SCSI interface" driver
	* a "SCSI over PCMCIA interface" driver
	* a "pretend all IDE CD-writers are SCSI CD-writers" driver
to create device record and attach to it a SCSI device access token which
would say:
	* how to find the driver which acts as an intermediary to the device
	* the interface access parameters (such as SCSI LUN)
	* further information about the device
[For example]
  Take the case of a someone writing a SCSI-CDROM driver. What they'd do is
  create a driver structure and register it with the system. This would
  specify a set of SCSI device types or classes that it can handle. The system
  would then attach any suitable SCSI CD-ROM devices to that driver. The
  driver would then be able to pull the SCSI device token out of the device
  structure. This would say what low-level driver to go to actually communicate
  with the device.
Also I'm currently adding a bus layer to the config manager. This will allow
such a low-level driver to implement a virtual bus representing a SCSI device
chain, whether it be directly over a SCSI interface, or whether it's done
through a PCMCIA interface.
I'm also setting up a new web-site (since my old one vanished). It is  at
http://www.astarte.free-online.co.uk
, but is incomplete as yet.
