Hello,
I entered make menuconfig with 2.4.2 patched with AC6.
I run 2.4.2 AC2 at the moment, and unpacked 2.4.2 and AC6 from the scratch
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu0: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
root@ascent:/usr/src/linux#
It doesn't like me :(
