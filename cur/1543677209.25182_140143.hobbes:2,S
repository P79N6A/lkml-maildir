Hi Dave. This is the output from my Celeron 600A system -- it's a tiny bit
different from what others posted to the list (an 0x86 instead of an 0x87).
My understanding is that this CPU has half the L2 cache of the "real"
Pentium M. Hope this is helpful and not annoying. Also, a question: I had
assumed that the lack of info in /proc/cpuinfo was simply that an
informational problem, and that the cache is actually working. Am I
mistaken? (I.e. will having the kernel support this be a huge performance
increase?) Thanks!
