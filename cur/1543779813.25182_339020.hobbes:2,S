But as to my knowledge, the HPA was had been introduced to allow HW vendors to 
store things like diagnostic programs in a part of the disk protected from 
partitioning and filesystems. The point is, IF there is an HPA, there MIGHT 
be a partitioning scheme and some filesystems on the disk which rely on the 
size of disk being the native size MINUS the HPA.
Also there might be some contents in the HPA which is vulnerable to deletion 
if exposed to the OS in such a transparent way.
So unconditionally disabling the HPA seems not an unconditionally good idea to 
me.
Why is the HPA not just left alone?
Best regards
Oliver
