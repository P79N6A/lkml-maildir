Well yes and no. The problem is that the 'slot' is not the connector!
It's easy to determine the slot to which they refer simply from the
bits at <11:15>. However, applications are not supposed to do the
port I/O to get this info, though. Instead, they are supposed to use
BIOS32 or other provisions.
All of the information necessary to observe/configure the bridge(s)
is/are available from the two ports specified in the standard.
Machines that don't have 'ports' emulate them (also in the standard)
so that minimum changes are necessary.
When a vendor puts a PCI Ethernet controller or a SCSI controller
on the board (or both). Any notion of a slot referencing a card-
connector goes out the window.
Linux now provides a 'local' PCI database. However, if hot-swapping
of PCI devices becomes a reality, this extra code may have limited
utility. Nevertheless it is a good idea for fixed configurations
that use modules because one doesn't run the risk of corrupting
a running PCI bus to get the resource information necessary to
install a new module.
The invisibility of a physical connector may actually be good. This
allows any PCI board to work in any PCI card-connector. Software that
requires a particular card-connector is probably broken by design.  If
software needs someone to 'adjust' something on a particular board,
hardware should provide an indication on the board (like a LED).

I have heard that there is a spec available on the Net . However, I just
buy the latest books because the company has "plenty" of money and
I like hard copies. Sombody else will probably tell you where. There
is even a complete BIOS (several) on the Net.
