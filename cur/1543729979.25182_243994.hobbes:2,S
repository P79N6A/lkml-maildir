The L2 cache is *on the CPU chip itself*. Any CPU recent enough to
physically fit into an nForce board has the L2 cache on the CPU itself.
I think the last Athlons to have separate L2 cache chips were the Slot A
models, and even then, the L2 cache chips were still on the CPU module
and not the motherboard.

Yeah, disabling the L2 cache on a modern CPU makes it really slow. But,
it's still a useful troubleshooting option...
