This could be static to rd_open().

I suspect that we've inherited enough locking from the caller to not need
this.  That's if fs/block_dev.c:do_open() is the only caller.  Not sure if
that's true if someone goes and partitions a ramdisk (is that possible?).
All this gendisk/blockdev/contains/partitions/bd_inode stuff is quite
ghastly.  Every six months I spend long enough staring at it to
half-understand it and then promptly forget how it all works.
