Just to let you know; kernel.org has been suffering for performance
problems lately, but in the last few days, for reasons we're not
really clear about, the performance problems seem to have spread to
the upload procedure.  Thus, unfortunately, you might see long times
between uploading something and when things appear on the main
repository.
We are already in late-stage discussions with sponsors about new
hardware, so bear with us.
