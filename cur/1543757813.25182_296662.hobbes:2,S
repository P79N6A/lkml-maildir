I can add "policies". With ELSA, a process belongs to one or several
groups and if a process is removed from one group, its children still
belong to the group. Thus a good idea could be to associate a
"philosophy" to a group. For exemple, when a group of processes is
created it can be tagged as UNIQUE or SHARED. UNIQUE means that a
process that belongs to it could not be added in another group by
opposition to SHARED. It's not needed inside the kernel.

It's what I'm proposing. The problem is to be alerted when a new process
is created in order to add it in the correct group of processes if the
parent belongs to one (or several) groups. The notification can be done
with the fork connector patch.

Yes it can but the risk is to lose some forks no? 
I think that /bin/ps is using the /proc interface. If we're polling
the /proc to catch process creation we may lost some of them. With the
fork connector we catch all forks and we can check that by using the
sequence number (incremented by each fork) of the message.
