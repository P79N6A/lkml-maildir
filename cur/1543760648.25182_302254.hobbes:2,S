Hi,
This is yet another report from FiSC :)  This time FiSC complains that
sync on msdos and vfat doesn't flush everything out.  Crash after sync
still causes data loss.
Test cases and crashed disk images can be found at
http://fisc.stanford.edu/bug8
    (msdos)
http://fisc.stanford.edu/bug11
   (vfat)
Confirmations/clarifications are apprecitaed.
