I figured it out. I can choose input source as Internal, Dock, Mic, Mix. If
I choose Mix, the Internal Mic in playback cannot be mute otherwise nothing is
captured by an application. If I choose Internal, the Internal Mic in playback
can be mute and applications still record from sound from the internal
microphone.
Is this expected?
So: Input source = Internal = muting Internal Mic (in playback) works fine.
    Input source = Mix = muting Internal Mic (in playback) stops recording
                        from the internal mic for applications.
If this is not expected, I send those alsa-info files. Thanks.
