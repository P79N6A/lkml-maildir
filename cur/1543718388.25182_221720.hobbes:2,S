You're obviously not the only one with that problem, because I'm having a
similar problem with my laptop's (Acer Aspire 1705SCi) sis900 NIC:
If I test network performance using netio I get ~4.4 MByte/s from my Linux
server (RTL8139 NIC) to the laptop but ~11 MB/s from the laptop to the
server (if the laptop is running Linux).
Disabling ACPI or the APIC doesn't help in my case, too.
When I'm running WinXP or FreeBSD on the laptop I get 11 MB/s in both
directions.
