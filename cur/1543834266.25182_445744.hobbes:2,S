What can a contributor do when he comes across code which deviates from
CodingStyle? He cannot tell whether the initial developer wasn't forced
to adhere to CodingStyle or the maintainer wants it that way. So, the
contributor
 - could ask the maintainer for his ruleset before writing a patch, or
 - could simply write the patch and wait if the maintainer feels need to
   demand adjustments.
I am not sure which strategy will consume less time of contributor and
maintainer.
