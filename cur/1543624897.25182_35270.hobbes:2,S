You cannot _build_ the tree without the initcall methods - it's populating
the tree that the initcalls mostly do, after all.
We could make one of the methods be "startup", of course, and move the
actual device initialization there (and leave just the "find driver" in
the initcall logic), but that would not get rid of the initcalls, it would
just split them into two parts.
