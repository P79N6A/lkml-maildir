We don't need to solve the 100% case. Simply being sure we can (slowly)
allocate up to 25% of RAM in huge chunks is going to be enough. Good point
Ingo on one thing I'd missed - the big chunks themselves need some kind
of handles since the moment we hand out 512K chunks we may not be able to 
shuffle and get a 4Mb block
