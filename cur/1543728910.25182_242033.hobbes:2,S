NAK.
First of all, that compile fix isn't - try to compile these drivers and see
if any got fixed by that.
While we are at it, if they would compile, you would have broken them.
Question: what do you think the argument in question was controlling
and why would "drop it silently" be a correct fix?
And finally, the reason why these drivers would fail to compile for quite
a while has a lot in common with the reason why they call fb_copy_cmap()
in the first place - they are trying to provide a method that doesn't exist
anymore and calls in question are from the instances of that method.  Fixing
that is going to remove these calls anyway.
