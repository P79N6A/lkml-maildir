It does.

Yes - vmlinux is generated before it gets on to the boot/bboot,
setup/bsetup dependancies, so this gets handled the same way.
Here's the relevant lines from arch/i386/Makefile...
 Q> MAKEBOOT = $(MAKE) -C arch/$(ARCH)/boot
 Q> 
 Q> zImage: vmlinux
 Q> 	@$(MAKEBOOT) zImage
 Q> 
 Q> bzImage: vmlinux
 Q> 	@$(MAKEBOOT) bzImage
...and the relevant lines from arch/i386/boot/Makefile...
 Q> zImage: $(CONFIGURE) bootsect setup compressed/vmlinux tools/build
 Q> 	$(OBJCOPY) compressed/vmlinux compressed/vmlinux.out
 Q> 	tools/build bootsect setup compressed/vmlinux.out $(ROOT_DEV) > zImage
 Q> 
 Q> bzImage: $(CONFIGURE) bbootsect bsetup compressed/bvmlinux tools/build
 Q> 	$(OBJCOPY) compressed/bvmlinux compressed/bvmlinux.out
 Q> 	tools/build -b bbootsect bsetup compressed/bvmlinux.out $(ROOT_DEV) > bzImage
As you can see, the former have vmlinux as a dependancy, so it gets
compiled before their actions are called. In both cases, their actions
consist of a call to the latter, which then compile the boot sector
and setup code, and compress vmlinux, before performing their actions.
Best wishes from Riley.
