   Probably nothing per se. HOWEVER, we'd still need to save the state for 
   rounding etc, so we might as well save it all.
   
I see.
We preserve the rounding/etc. modes on sparc, we merely zap the actual
FPU registers around the system call.
And that's like 4 L2 cache lines of registers on sparc64, so there
really is a benefit from only saving the mode register across a system
call.
