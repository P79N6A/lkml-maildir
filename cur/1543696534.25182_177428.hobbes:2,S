Well, I'll still be looking to increase performance in libata, even such ;)
But stability before performance :)

Thank Promise, too.  They are actively supporting my efforts on this 
driver with hardware and docs.  Promise has also provided Arjan (author 
of "pdcraid") with documentation on their vendor-specific RAID format, 
and they are making other efforts to better support open source, and be 
more friendly with the open source community.
