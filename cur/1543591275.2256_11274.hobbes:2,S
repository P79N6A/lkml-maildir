One thing that I thought was really spiffy was someone who had done
patches to populate a ramfs from a tarball loaded via the initrd
bootloader protocol... call it "initial ramfs."  It allowed a whole
lot of cleanup -- the "initrd" isn't magic anymore (instead use
pivot_root), and it gets rid of the rd stuff.  At the same time it
does allow the full flexibility of a fullblown filesystem that can be
populated with arbitrary contents.
