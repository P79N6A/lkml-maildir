Because the people need it are usally at the application level.
It would be useful with hard disk editing.
But this would need a move_blocks within the filesystem, which
could attach a given list of blocks to another file.
E.g. mremap() for files :-)
Both together would make harddisk video editing with linux quite
performant and less error prone.
