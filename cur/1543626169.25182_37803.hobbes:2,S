Good thing, but naming is pretty inconsistent.
You have device_register() but register_sys_device().

PS: On toshiba 4030cdt, I can suspend once without no apparent ill
effects. On resume I get 
utmisc-0373 Ut_acquire_mutex : Invalid acquire order: Thread 5C owns
[ACPI_MTX_Hardware], wants [ACPI_MTX_Namespace].
followed by more warnings. Is there easy way to debug this?
