That being said, I see from
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=177951
that a blacklisting of some Maxtor drives for this issue has
supposedly occurred or been pushed and accepted "upstream" in git ....
 For the obvious (selfish) reasons, I'd like to minimize the number of
Maxtor drives that are blacklisted, as I don't believe this is a drive
issue at all.
If there's a drive model out there reporting support for FUA but
screwing it up, I'm all ears as that's something I need to know about.
 If basic adapter functional testing is required for some of these
low-level commands, then that might be something I can help with too
(on a very limited scale), since we have access to ~100 different
chipsets.
