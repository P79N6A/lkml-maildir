Is any of a userland application's virtual address space reserved?
Certainly, some memory is used at startup: the code is loaded into some
of the virtual space, as well as the stack.  There needs to always be
enough space for the stack to grow as necessary.  But is any of the
space actually marked off as "reserved"?  If we just mmap'ed the same
file over and over again, could we fill the 4Gb address space with
identical mappings, or would we run out?
