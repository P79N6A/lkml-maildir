Subject: Where can I get the patch for 2.2.15 to fix the buffer overflows?

I am trying to compile a new kernel to fix the security problems with pre
2.2.16 kernels.  I have a DPT SmartRAID V controller which has a driver and
patch that only supports up kernels 2.2.12, 2.2.14, and 2.2.15.  When I try
running the patch on 2.2.16 I get a kernel error saying "Unable to handle
NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000" and "Bad EIP value."
The way I am trying to rectify this is by installing 2.2.15 and I heard
about a patch for this kernel which fixes the buffer overflow problem.  The
problem is I cannot find this patch.  Could anyone point me in the right
direction?
Also, as a side note, are there any plans to support these controllers in
the future?
Thanks!
