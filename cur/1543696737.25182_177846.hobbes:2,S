Ok. The nice thing about getting a serial console is that now you could 
try the NMI watchdog - just boot up with "nmi_watchdog=1" on the kernel 
command line (or "=2" - see Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt for more 
information on it). 
That won't necessarily see the problem either, especially if it's a total 
hardware lockup brought on by X poking registers in unfortunate ways, but 
if it's a pure kernel lockup with interrupts disabled, it can help.
