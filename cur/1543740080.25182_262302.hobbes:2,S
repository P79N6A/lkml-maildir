I thought there was a goal to not add multiplexer syscalls anymore,
especially not without thinking about 32/64 bit emulation first...
sounds like it's best to back out this changeset until that bit is
resolved (I thought the agreement was that this one was stuck in -mm
until this got sorted out in the first place)
