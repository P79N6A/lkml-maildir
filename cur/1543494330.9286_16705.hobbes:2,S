I had a look through the eexpress driver and it did seem to be missing some 
SMP locking.  I'm not especially hopeful that this will fix the problems you 
were seeing, but here's a patch that should do roughly the right thing anyway.
I'd also be somewhat interested to hear if it makes any difference for better 
or worse on UP systems.
