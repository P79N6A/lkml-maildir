hi
when dialing out from the D-link MGCP phone (they actually work now - most of 
the time), I get lots of DTMF noise whenever the other person talks. I only 
get this from the MGCP phone - not with MSN messenger. This seems to be an 
error in isdn4linux falsely detecting DTMF in speech with Asterisk creating 
the actual noise.
This testing has been done on hhe following cards (from lspci)
02:09.0 Network controller: Cologne Chip Designs GmbH ISDN network controller 
[HFC-PCI] (rev 02)
02:0a.0 Network controller: Cologne Chip Designs GmbH ISDN network controller 
[HFC-PCI] (rev 02)
02:0b.0 Network controller: Cologne Chip Designs GmbH ISDN network controller 
[HFC-PCI] (rev 02)
