Sorry, yes, it is 2.6.9 that I'm using atm. I pushed
/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes up to 2048 (it was at 987 or something)
as Christoph suggested and so far, so good. It was such an infrequent
thing though, it's hard to tell if it did any good. I left some stuff
hammering on the array to run over the holiday break, so hopefully any
bad stuff will shake out. I'll give 2.6.10-rc2+ a whirl when I get back
on monday.
Thanks everyone,
Phil
