My point of view in saying you can't dismiss the current KLive stats
completely, is simply that I didn't expect reiser4 numbers to be so
high even in the small sample of the brave KLive project that is full
of people willing to test new stuff (also note that I compared it to
isofs, I didn't attempt a comparison with ext3 myself). That makes it
a positive in my view.
If you think KLive numbers aren't a positive point for reiser4, then
it can only mean you expected them to be even higher than they were...
