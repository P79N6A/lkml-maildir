Subject: [UPDATE] zerocopy patch against 2.4.2-pre2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/2/9/14

As usual:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/zerocopy-2.4.2p2-1.diff.gz
It's updated to be against the latest (2.4.2-pre2) and I've removed
the non-zerocopy related fixes from the patch (because I've sent them
under seperate cover to Linus).
Enjoy.  As usual, I am very seriously interested in any bugs or
performance problems introduced by this patch.  Thanks.
Later,
