Yes, I know, it's mainly to shut up the warning in some resonable way. We 
may be saving a few loop iterations, but we'll be adding a subtraction, so 
performance wise it probably won't make any difference - but it's a very 
cold code path as far as I can see, so it matters little.

Then isn't my way of shutting up gcc more sensible? little to no impact on 
the code and we get rid of the annoying warning in a safe way that won't 
break anything.
I'll prepare patches against a recent Linus kernel for the other things in 
binfmt_elf I have lying here and submit those shortly, those should fix 
more real issues - I hope you won't mind if I also send those your way.
Thank you very much for taking a look.
