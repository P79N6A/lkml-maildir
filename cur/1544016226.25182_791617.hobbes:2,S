Why can't this just be somewhere in documentation? (possibly even with the 
byte locks code as a reference).
It is IMHO just totally confusing to have a spinlock implementation that 
is not used at all in the tree. It took me quite some time to go through 
this until I finally figured out that this code is actually never used. 
Currently, on first sight it might seem that byte locks are used whenever 
CONFIG_PARAVIRT is set, which is not true.
And apparently even Linus got confused by this, which also tells us 
something by itself, see [1].
