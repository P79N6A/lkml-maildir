Okay. So is it fair to say it's largely XFS that's the problem? No problems 
with LVM/MD and say plain ext? If that's the case, I believe it could be 
concluded that it's not something in any sense fundamentally unfixable and 
the question becomes why XFS isn't fixed...

No, quite, that specific combination was reported in this thread alone 3 
times again, so that one's clear, but _other_ than that, I've heard of no 
other failure modes.

Except these. Good to have pointed out, thanks, but as far as I'm concerned 
both these cases do not get a say in what's default configuration for the 
kernel.org kernel. They might get a say in what's removed or not removed 
from that kernel but that's not under discussion at the moment (nor would I 
expect it to be anytime soon if ever).
