Works for me on an Inspiron 8000.  The trackpoint does not, which is a 
known bug.  Of course, the 3800 might be different...
Have you been bitten by the input layer configuration issue?  Here's what I 
have:
#
# Input device support
#
CONFIG_INPUT=y
#
# Userland interfaces
#
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX=y
#
# Input Device Drivers
#
CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBOARD=y
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE=y
CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=y
