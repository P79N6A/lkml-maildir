Trying to compile bind 9.1.0 here.
Kernel is 2.2.18, gcc 2.7.2.1.
It failed trying to find the type for rlim_t.
The C file says BSD/OS is the only OS they found not to have rlim_t.
Am I missing something?
Where can i find this in linux? I looked in all the include
files, including resource.h
For now i jsut typedefed it as a long.
Also, it's looking for a setting for SYS_capset to pass to syscall()
and can't that either. Again, I looked in the include files without
success.
Thanx,
-Tony
