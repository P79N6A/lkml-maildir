Hi List,
I'm running a 2.6.14 linux on 96 MHz MIPS processor. I need to cope
with a device that sends a byte of data every 50 microsecond through
an UART with no FIFO. What would be the best (well, the least
horrible) way to handle that ? The good point is that I know when the
communication starts.
Any idea, any help, any "good luck" will be much appreciated !
Thanks in advance,
Ivan
