 It looks like untranslated mode 2 (i.e. the AT keyboard's mode).  You
switch translation on or off by toggling a bit in the onboard 8042's
command byte. 
 PS/2-style keyboards start in mode 2 usually.  An XT compatibility (bit 7
meaning release) is provided by the onboard 8042 translating codes.  Some
systems (I think DEC OSF/1, for example) program keyboards to work in mode
3 (the PS/2 native mode) or possibly mode 1 (XT compatibility mode); for
these modes the 8042's translation has to disabled or the keyboard will be
next to useless.  It's also meaningful to disable the translation in mode
2 -- you are presented with the AT interface then.
