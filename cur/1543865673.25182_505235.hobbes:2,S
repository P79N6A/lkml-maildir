Adding a 'select' statement might solve that particular problem:
 "What config symbols do I need to turn on to enable FOO"
but it creates another problem which is at precisely the same level.
IOW:
 "What config symbols do I need to turn off to disable FOO"
Both require the use of grep to solve it.  Both are as bad as each
other.  'select' only moves the problem - it doesn't actually solve
anything.
The real problem is that "band-aiding" the problem is all too easy,
so we just bung a select in.  We're actually storing up bigger problems
for the future, making the kernel configuration system more and more
complex, sometimes creating circular dependencies through select/depends,
basically turning it into something several orders of magnitude worse
than the original shell scripts.
The only real way I see the problem truely getting solved is if folk
start standing up against throwing "select" in so there's some
motivation to actually fix the underlying problem.
