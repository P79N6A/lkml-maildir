Hi,
I'm having the following problem: after I start X11 (or gpm with no X)
my keyboard and PS/2 mouse sometimes locks up. What could that be?
440BX UP celeron mobo here (Abit - BH6?), '94 AT keyboard, '2000 A4tech
2-wheel mouse, various Linux 2.4 versions (usually -ac, currently 2.4.10ac3).
I'm using NVidia Xserver module, but it doesn't seem related (the lookup
occured with no X while starting gpm once or twice).
If I kill Xserver (haven't tried with gpm), the keyboard (and mouse) start
working again (the next Xserver spawn works fine).
For me, it looks like some race condition between open_aux and mouse
(kbd?) interrupt, causing interrupts or kbd controller to stay disabled
after the mouse device is opened. The interrupt counters for both kbd
and psaux stay constant when I move the mouse and/or press buttons/keyboard
keys:

I'm currently keeping this machine in locked state, so I can provide more
info.
What I also found is that open_aux routine isn't protected by lock_kernel(),
while release_aux is. Is that correct? Would a mouse interrupt received
before open_aux() is completed cause such a lookup?
