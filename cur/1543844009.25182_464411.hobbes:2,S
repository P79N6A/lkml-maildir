Thanks for your contribution to Linux.
I'm not really deep enough into the high level swapping algorithm to
evaluate
your patch competently, but your result looks promising. Normally this
code is considered pretty fragile unfortunately so some more testing
would be definitely needed. It's good that you gave a clear rationale
on what you changed at least.
I would recommend to do perhaps do some benchmarks on smaller machines
with 
the patch too (just to make sure there are no regressions on them)  and 
possible try
a few more different workloads and then post on linux-mm@kvack.org.
There is 
where all the VM hackers tend to hang out.
