But there's currently an issue with the second case you're talking
about. The dock driver doesn't generate any event in the bay driver on
undock. And due to the fact that the dock driver automatically issues a
ACPI undock, the hardware indication on the dock station signals
"everything alright" to the user so there's no way to tell the user that
he is not allowed to pull away the docking station because there's still
some file system mounted inside the cdrom. Userspace would need some time
to handle that IMHO.
