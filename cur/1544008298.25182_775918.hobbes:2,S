 Well i already sent the result of the revert on another mail;
it did not help :(
 I tried again with what i thought was my "good" commit and the
bug is there too :/
 could it be that something changed in userspace[1] between the
day i installed the 2.6.28-rc6-00007-ged31348 and today that
make this bug trigger? i dunno
 Next step is try to find an "actually good" kernel and bisect
again sigh... 2.6.27.6 seems to work ok
