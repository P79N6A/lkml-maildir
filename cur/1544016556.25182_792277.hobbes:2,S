We actually use 6 different thresholds for killing processes. I don't
know what all the classes are, processes with a higher oom_adj value
can be killed with less impact to the user than processes with a lower
oom_adj value. The first few classes only affect latency when
switching apps, but later classes stop non critical background
services and finally the foreground app. Another reason to not kill
every process at the same threshold is that memory may not be free
immediately when the process is killed.
