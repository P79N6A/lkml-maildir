Not only that, the new children will exist temporarily in a state where 
their parent is suspended and they are not.  Clearly we cannot allow 
children to be registered below suspended parents.

This is a new requirement.  We didn't have to worry about it with the 
freezer.  Driver maintainers need to know about it.

At that stage there isn't any real need to hold the semaphores.  And it 
complicates unregistration, which should always be allowed.  At the 
moment I don't see any benefit to locking all the semaphores.

Correct.

Yes.  We could keep it, but not acquire it until after all devices have 
been suspended.  This might catch some errors.

Exactly; this has to be added to the PM documentation.
The difficulty arises only for drivers that support hotplugging, that 
is, detecting and registering children from somewhere other than their 
probe method.

The pm_sleep_rwsem will do a better job of catching such errors.

Do they need to register new CPUs at some point?  There ought to be a 
way to handle that.
