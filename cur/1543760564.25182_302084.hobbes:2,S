The fd is set in non-blocking mode on opening, so when there is no data UML 
will not block but get -EAGAIN (which is then handled by waiting and 
retrying).

Yes, and entropy will gradually degrade...

Don't ask us..., we just recycle the others knowledge... however in short when 
you say that "randomness" (or entropy) is not the maximum, you mean that 
there is some redundancy, i.e. some law to ease predicting subsequent 
numbers. For instance some character is more frequent than another... And 
this is also the same kind of things that is exploited during compression... 
the more compressed are your data, the less entropy they have before 
compression (I'm not an expert of Shannon information entropy theories, 
however, but this is what I grasped).
