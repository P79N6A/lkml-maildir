Oh really? So the fact BIOS returns 16383,16,63 instead of 19650,16,63 is
not a BIOS bug? (Linux could *NOT!!* use the whole 10gb until I manually
passed in the CHS on the kernel command line).
Having a CHS table for this drive would have helped.

You dont. The blacklist is a list of "CHS override values" for known
drives. Let us take this example.
Drive is a WDC AC310100B (~10gb). BIOS returns CHS that is completely
wrong. We know true CHS is 19650,16,63. So we override the BIOS and use
true CHS. Ta dah. We win, even though the BIOS is broken.

Sorry, but it does.
