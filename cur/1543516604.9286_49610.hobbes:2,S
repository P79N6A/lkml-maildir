I've compiled the kernel several times with 2.3.26 and it seems fine.  I
haven't noticed any bit errors.  I've been using 2.3.26 since Nov 7.
Might you have better luck with mem=NM where N = your machine's
megabytes minus one?  I use mem=63M.  Without it, 2.3.25 crashes and I
haven't removed it since.
