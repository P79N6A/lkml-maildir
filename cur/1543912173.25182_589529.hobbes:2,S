Ingo, Appended patch seems to fix the issue and as far as I can test, seems ok
to me.
This is a quick fix for .23. Peter Williams and myself plan to look at
code cleanups in this area (HT/MC optimizations) post .23
BTW, with this fix, do you want to retain the current FUZZ value?
thanks,

Try to fix MC/HT scheduler optimization breakage again, with out breaking
the FUZZ logic.
First fix the check
	if (*imbalance + SCHED_LOAD_SCALE_FUZZ < busiest_load_per_task)
with this
	if (*imbalance < busiest_load_per_task)
As the current check is always false for nice 0 tasks (as SCHED_LOAD_SCALE_FUZZ
is same as busiest_load_per_task for nice 0 tasks).
With the above change, imbalance was getting reset to 0 in the corner case
condition, making the FUZZ logic fail. Fix it by not corrupting the
imbalance and change the imbalance, only when it finds that the
HT/MC optimization is needed.
