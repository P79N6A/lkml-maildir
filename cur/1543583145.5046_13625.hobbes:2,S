That would imply to let the drivers parse all headers to figure out the length.
I think it's better to have a "header base" and "data base" pointer.
The driver would just copy some standard size that likely contains all of
the header 
When you're finished with the header use 
skb->database+(skb->hdrptr-skb->hdrbase) to get the start of data. 
Or did I misunderstand you?
