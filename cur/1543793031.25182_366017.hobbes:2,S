    Since some point in the 2.6.12 kernel there has been a 
no_timer_check option available to amd64 users to solve a bug which 
causes the kernel clock on some athlon 64 system to run at 2x speed.  I 
was wondering if it was possible to get this implemented in the i386 
architecture too.  The code is rather simple and only requires something 
like 10 lines of code to be added to the io_apic.c file, however it is a 
pain to add it to every upgrade that becomes available.  Who should I 
ask to get this included as a standard?
