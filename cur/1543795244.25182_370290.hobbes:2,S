Subject: [patch 03/22] Clarify T: field in MAINTAINERS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/23/503

From: Jody McIntyre <scjody@steamballoon.com>
Pavel Machek points out that for git repos, what we include is not
actually a URL.  It is undesirable to use a URL since git repos can be
accessed in many different ways.
