The difference being that there the denials were against unlabeled_t
(the expected default in the presence of no iptables SECMARK rules, and
allowed by current policies), while the denials against 2.6.20.17 were
against kernel_t.  Which shouldn't ever happen unless you have an
iptables SECMARK rule that assigns that value to a packet.  So this is a
different issue.  BTW, the fact that it is showing up as kernel_t means
that skb->secmark == SECINITSID_KERNEL == 1, FWIW.  Whereas it should be
zero in the absence of iptables rules that set it.
