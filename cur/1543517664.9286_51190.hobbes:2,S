Try copying the tulip.c driver that is included on the Linksys Disk 2
onto /usr/src/linux/drivers/net and then recompile the kernel with the
tulip driver enabled.  For some reason the lastest tulip.c drivers, as
well as the ones included with RH, do not work with the Linksys card. 
However, the older modified driver on the Linksys diskette does.
