  Hello,
I've seen some problem reports on this board, but I just had something
I've seen to be reported for some tulip board - the board just freezes and
stops receiving ( or transmiting? ) packets. Running tcpdump makes her run
again. The machine has 2 RTL8139 boards and one 8029 , all on different
IRQs... Here follow the cpuinfo,interrups,and .config files...
  If someone can help, it'll be great, because I've got running tcpdump on
the interface that fails, so I hope it won't stop tonight :)
