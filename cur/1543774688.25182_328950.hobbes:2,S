We tend to use the term operation vectors, yes.  But that's a different
terminology that doesn't mix up very well with the OO terminology.

Kinda.  The VFS doesn't have knowledge about what constitutes a file
system driver, we register filesystems only to know what routine to
call in on a mount with a particular filesystem type - the structure that
does describe a filesystem (struct file_system_type) thus is very small.
Starting from there the filesystem has always been able to use different
methods for different objects (that's something very different from the
vnode-based VFSes in the other UNIX variants).

For the file and dir plugin that's pretty much that case.  What's more
problematic is your security plugins.  With LSM we alredy have an
infrastructure to provide pluggable access control.  If there actually
was an implementation of "security" (it's actually access control) for it
besides the default unix permission one it should move to an LSM.  You
could even make your lsm part of the reiser4 module and poke into reiser4
directly from a technical point of view.
