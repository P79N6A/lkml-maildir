I have the "Gnome workstation" version of rawhide (7.0.xxx) on my new laptop. 
I don't see sudo. Of course, it's rawhide, but you'd think, if it were in 7.0, 
it'd make it. Or maybe they decided that the gnome workstation didn't need 
it... Hmmm.

Sucks if you are trying to figure out a VT problem.

Let's accept one thing: Root, should in fact, be allowed to do anything a 
regular user can. The fact that hanging is a possibility might ought to be 
pointed out. I have my shell set up to tell me I'm root. But the fact is, the 
typical sys-admin is essentially always logged in as root somewhere, and 
changing terminals to look at man pages is sometimes not an option.
For that matter, I have often figured out that something had funny permission 
problems by discovering that the problem goes away if I run a program as root.
Assuming everything root is doing must be sacrosanct is a pipe dream.  
Assuming everything a regular user is doing is expendable is BOFH think.
I do agree that you have to draw a line. I'm just saying that's the wrong one.

Good. I hope it comes out well in 7.1, considering my experience with rawhide.
