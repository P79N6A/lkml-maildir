I tried 2.4.8 final and it fixes the problem.... could it be the 
fs/buffer.c changes? behaviour is now like 2.2 (good in this case). if I 
have time I'll try 2.4.8-ac5 to se if it also fixes it. thanks to whoever 
is responsible for the fix.
also I tried 2.4.9-pre3 and it performs _much_ [I'd say 10 times better!]
better under high VM load specifically when filling all ram+swap. Where
2.4.8 used to thrash without making any progress what so ever [I'd have to
reset], 2.4.9-pre3 will either oom_kill (the _right_ process) or manage to
handle swap to let processes run without thrashing. this is all on PPC 
without any highmem (192Mb + 200mb swap.).
