The code here is fine.  Immediately before the int13 is an stc
instruction, so the carry flag is set.  sti and popw don't change CF.
What this means is that your BIOS cleared CF in the int13 to a
nonexistant disk, rather than setting CF (or leaving it unchanged).
CF being clear means the command succeeded.  In your case, the BIOS
cleared it, but shouldn't have.
Care to share your system type / BIOS version, and if it's at all
recent, file an bug with their support department?

Yet, it does properly set CF on int13 AH=41h to a nonexistant disk.
How annoying.

I'll look more next week, but what isn't ever happening is an int13
AH=15h GET DISK TYPE probe to see if the disk is there.  The edd.S
code just issue a READ SECTORS and expects that to fail (to set CF) if
it's not there.  This has been working fine for most people.  In your
case, it's not reporting a failure (CF is cleared by the int13).  Now,
there's no guarantee your BIOS would respond properly to the GET DISK
TYPE command either.  There are also notes that BIOS should set
0040h:0075h to the number of drives present, and the code isn't
reading that value now either.  Either of these tests, if the BIOS
isn't buggy for them, could result in reporting the right number of
disks.
Thanks much for the report and for digging to find where the mistake
could be.
Thanks,
Matt
