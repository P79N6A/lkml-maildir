Subject: How to know current Kernel Configuration?

Suppose I have redhat Linux 9.0 installed which comes with kernel 2.4.20, and I want to compile 2.4.22 by myself. And I want to keep most configuration settings because I think these settings should be pretty good, how can I know the current configuration of the current kernel? I know make has a option "make oldconfig", but seems like it is the old configuration of the last times "make", not the one of current running kernel. 
Is there any command to list all current running linux kernel configuration which is used to compile that version?
Thanks in advance!
