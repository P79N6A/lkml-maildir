You don't know much about unwinding, do you?  The same information is
needed for C++ exception handling, thread cancellation, etc.  Now go on
and tell me you don't need this either.

And I told you that the support which magically makes all this sometimes
work without the unwind info in the vdso will sooner or later break.
Then whatever other libc is out there has to get vdso support to be able
to function correctly.
