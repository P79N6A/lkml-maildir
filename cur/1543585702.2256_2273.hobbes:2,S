Noticed that my sigtimedwait timeout patch got into the kernel, so polled signal I/O should now
work much better.
The question on why the timeout is calculated with an +1 for non-zero timeouts is still open.
AFAICT is is not needed as timespec_to_jiffies() does a correct rounding. The effect now is
 timeout    sleeping
 0          0
 1ns        2 jiffies
 1 jiffies  2 jiffies
 2 jiffies  3 jiffies
 3 jiffies  4 jiffies
 ...
If the "+1" is taken out then the timeout scale becomes the expected one, starting at 1 jiffie, not
2.
