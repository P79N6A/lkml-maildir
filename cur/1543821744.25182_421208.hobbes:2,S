I rather think it's showing us there was a glitch when switching.
I have a mechanical switch that sometimes produces this message, and every 
now and then, the keyboard loses its key repeat time/rate setting.
It often happens when the switch is not turned quickly or firmly enough 
and in such a case I had the keyboard port lock up completely a few times. 
I think the kernel should report such a situation.
If people are "confused" by valid error messages, they can use certain 
proprietary operating systems that hide the ugly truth from them. What's 
next, removing "access beyond end of device"? I want to stay informed if 
my mechanical switch produces glitches. There are electronic ones that 
don't.
It would be nice if kernel messages had a structure that allowed a 
verbosity setting, but until then, non-confused users want the 
information they can get.
Regards, Nuri
