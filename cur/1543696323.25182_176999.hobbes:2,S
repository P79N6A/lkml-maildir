I dunno what I did.  This was -test9, using dev=/dev/hdc.  It was also 
something like a week ago.  Halfway through the burn it died because the 
buffer had run dry, and I made a second coaster to confirm that it was 
scrolling a konqueror window that had done it.
I probably forgot to run it as root.  (I don't remember it complaining, but I 
was in the middle of about four other things at the time.  It did _start_ the 
burn, and made it about halfway through.)  My laptop was also on battery 
power, which may have had something to do with it, although I have a vague 
recollection of that working previously, and the battery wasn't anywhere near 
dead...
It's not something I've really followed up on.  It works if I leave it alone 
while it burns, and I haven't had to burn that many cds recently.  (I was 
burning a knoppix cd for a friend.)  I mostly back up through the network...
