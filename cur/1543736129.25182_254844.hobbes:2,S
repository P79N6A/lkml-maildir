You need to add another sysfs file called "rescan" or something.
Writing to that file will cause the kernel to rescan pci space, and add
any devices it finds that are not already present.  The code to do that
can be taken from the pci startup code in the kernel today.

That's fine.  You don't need real hotplug pci hardware to use fakephp,
that's what the driver is for :)

That's a 2.4 interface.  I need to get a new version of that program out
there that works for 2.6 one of these days (the bk version of the
program has this support already in it, if you want to mess with
that...)

Not really, sorry.

That's the driver that I based fakephp on.  It's a good starting point
for what it sounds like you want to do.
Hope this helps,
