in which namespace are these? And are they in a chroot?
And what if someone makes /etd a symlink to /etc :)
And what if I bind-mount something on top of /etc/shadow ?
or unlink the file while holding it open? Should the security suddenly
go away? There's no "directory" for this file anymore at that point.
Or if I hardlink /etc/shadhow to /tmp/shad ... what then?

how does this fix namespaces or even bind mounts?
(or even symlinks for that matter)
