How can you read that recommendation into what you just quoted? IBM says
use 30 sec if you enable write buffers, why would eliminate the long delay
but use the slow timeout anyway? To slow retry to a crawl? It would seem
obvious to do one thing or the other, but not to take all possible action
to make things crawl. I suggest that the obvious solution is use a
sensible timeout without write buffers to be really safe, or to get best
performance use the write buffers and force a flush at a sensible point,
somewhat like flushing buffers to disk with bdflush. There are already
spindown timers and such in the drivers, this isn't a "whole new thing."
Since we have the ability to let the user set this now, I see no reason
not to let the user make the choice, Linux is about choice.
Finally, about copying other drivers: to quote my youngest, "yuckie-poo!"
Drivers should be written to the standard, with reality dictating that it
is sometimes required to write to the hardware when you absolutely MUST
use non-compliant hardware. To copy code from another driver seems like a
lack or either ability or committment.
