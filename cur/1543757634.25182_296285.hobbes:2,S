Perhaps the sentence above should start "So you are saying that ...".
I'm arguing that I should'nt have to perform a loop closing file 
descriptors I haven't opened.

This confirms above.

Now this is a good point.
I don`t do a double fork in autofs (inherited code), although, long ago I 
did.
Do we really need to do a double fork to disassociate from the controlling 
terminal or is a single fork and close etc. enough?
I notice that "setsid()" should do this but I've not seen it bofore.
Is that sufficient to do the job instead of the double fork?
And it looks like the automount process I just started still has a tty, 
grumble ....
