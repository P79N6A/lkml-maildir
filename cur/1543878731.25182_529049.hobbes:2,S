This is fun.

That one's needed to parent the call_usermodehelper() apps.  I don't think
it does anything else.  We used to use keventd for this but that had some
problem whcih I forget.  (Who went and misnamed keventd to "events", too? 
Nobody calls it "events", and with good reason)

Me either.

That's the softlockup detector.  Confusingly named to look like a, err,
watchdog.  Could probably use keventd.

That's there to parent the kthread_create()d threads.  Could presumably use
khelper.

Does it need to be per-cpu?

That's a single-threaded workqueue handler.  Perhaps could use keventd.

This machine has one CPU, one sata disk and one DVD drive.  The above is
hard to explain.

I can't even pronounce that.

OK, I do have 1394 hardware, but it hasn't been used.

I blame davej.

Sure.
I don't think it's completely silly to object to all this.  Sure, a kernel
thread is worth 4k in the best case, but I bet they have associated unused
resources and as we've seen, they can cause overhead.
