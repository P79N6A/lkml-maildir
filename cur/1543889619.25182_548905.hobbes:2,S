Subject: [BUG]: hrtimer overflow bug on 64-bit systems

I've been tracing this problem on sparc64 now that it uses hi-res
timers, and I finally figured it out.
The symptom is that ksoftirqd on most of the cpus of an idle SMP
system chew up around %10 of cpu time.
The raise_softirq_irqoff() is constantly being invoked via
tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick(), but why?
Tracing revealed that delta_ticks is enormous, which is correct
because no timers are pending on the cpu so we should schedule the
hrtimer as far into the future as possible.
tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() then proceeds to start the hrtimer, and
then it checks hrtimer_active() but for some reason this is always
false.
Why?
The reason is that the expires calculation here:
		expires = ktime_add_ns(last_update, tick_period.tv64 *
				       delta_jiffies);
overflows on 64-bit systems.
On 32-bit systems, LONG_MAX is a 32-bit quantity so the largest
possible delta_jiffies don't cause an overflow in this multiply
(which is 64-bit).  (LONG_MAX determines how large a value
will be returned to indicate "infinity" from get_next_timer_interrupt(),
specifically it's the initialization of local variable 'expires'
in __next_timer_interrupt).
Because of this 'expires' is zero and of course that causes the
hrtimer to not get scheduled at all.
I'm surprised this problem is not seen with the x86_64 hrtimer patches
applied :-)
I'm not exactly sure how to best fix this, we could either make
__next_timer_interrupt use INT_MAX or we could make
tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() realize and handle the overflow
properly.  Neither of those solutions are fully satisfactory in
my opinion :-)
FWIW, I've verified that using INT_MAX in __next_timer_interrupt()
makes the problem go away.
