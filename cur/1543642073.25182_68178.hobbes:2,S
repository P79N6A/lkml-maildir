   I believe SCSI defeated him. :)
If you can get at the interrupt handler, and the interrupt handler is
coded well enough to handle sharing interrupts (%99 of PCI scsi
drivers are) then it is doable.  Just submit it as normal through
scsi, mark it high priority somehow, and then keep calling the
interrupt handler in a loop until your command completes or fails :-)
