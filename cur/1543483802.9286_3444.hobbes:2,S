Thanks agian for the responses,
I openned up the Computer to look at the card,
after talking to the Manufacturer's Tech-support.
I found that the 'supposed S3-chip' is really SIS-6215.
The Digital-Research Tech-support told me two things :
1. They replaced the chip in many S3 box-labeled cards
   with the SIS-6215 chip, because "they ran of stock".
2. None of the Tech crew is familiar with Linux;
   and the one member, who is, won't talk about it.
Linux recognizes an "Unknown PCI SIS chip"
but can't find the Video RAM.
I could ONLY configure 640x480 & 800x600 modes as VGA16
But, I need 1600x1200, 1280x1024, 1024x768, etc.
