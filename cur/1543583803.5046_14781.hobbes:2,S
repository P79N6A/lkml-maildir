Anybody interested in the ~100 anti-spam regexps I'm using
on NL.linux.org at the moment ?
I think I could even setup something where we keep the
anti-spam regexps in a publicly accessible CVS tree (with
of course a nice script to automatically generate the
majordomo.cf).
[and yes ... I'm pretty sure the majordomo setup on NL.linux.org
will filter out this message if it's sent there]
regards,
Rik
