Subject: [PATCH] UML/x86_64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

UML has been ported to x86_64.  The patch for 2.6.4 is available at
	
http://www.user-mode-linux.org/mirror/uml-patch-x86-64-2.6.4.bz2
Note that this is separate from the 2.6.4 UML patch, and must be
applied to a 2.6.4 + uml-patch-2.6.4 tree.  It will remain separate
until I get it all merged cleanly into my tree.  At that point, the
separate x86_64 patch will disappear.
This patch is fairly nasty in places, and the build is also fairly
unclean, so avert your eyes if you are squeamish.  This will get
better as I merge it into my pool.
The nastiness aside, it does build and you do get a robust UML.
My thanks go to PathScale (pathscale.com) for sponsoring this work and
providing access to hardware to make it possible.
Finally, as I do the merge (and afterwards), I need access to an
Opteron to make sure I don't break this port.  So, if anyone has such
a box that I can have access to, let me know.
