My experience in this area is pretty narrow, so I don't know. I pretty much
only do device drivers for hardware designed here.
I believe the dominate search by far is by vendor and a set of device IDs.
In that case, you might as well just directly call pci_find_device() with
device ID set to any.
If the set of device IDs you handle is close to the number of possible
device IDs, you just set the device ID to PCI_ANY_ID and handle it in the
callback. There is little difference between using your interface and the
normal pci_find_device() call.
If the set of possible devices is much larger than the set you handle, then
it might be nice to eliminate those for a different class of device. It
would be a tradeoff between splitting it out by device ID (not using
PCI_ANY_ID) in the table or having the callback function executed a lot.
I know there are vendors out there that make more than one class of device.
It is in those cases that it might help to search by class as well.
In the end, I doubt it really matters that much. It isn't like searching the
list of PCI devices is performance critical. The only performance issue is
avoiding reading configuration space, since some machines have to disable
interrupts, install an exception handler to handle PCI Abort, or use a mutex
around PCI configuration accesses.
It would be nice if the callback was given the PCI vendor and device ID that
it matched. In the case where they used PCI_ANY_ID, this could save them
from reading the configuration space.
