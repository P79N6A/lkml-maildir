Probably it can be used to get rid of gccisms and "type fluff" due to
bitwise arithmetics in ALIGN?
Here:
#define ALIGN(x,a)		__ALIGN_MASK(x,(typeof(x))(a)-1)
#define __ALIGN_MASK(x,mask)	(((x)+(mask))&~(mask))
like that:
#define ALIGN(x,y)		__ALIGN_MASK(x,ilog2(y))
#define __ALIGN_MASK(x,bits)	(((((x) >> (bits)) << 1) + 2) << (bits - 1))
Note side effect, that this one always yields even result. Maybe this is
good, due to avoidance of misaligned access.
