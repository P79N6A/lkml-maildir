For what it's worth, I have had a similar problem with only a single 
parallel port involved, under -pre6 on a P75 compiled with egcs-1.1.1.  
The command was just "insmod plip.o".
In that instance parport.o and parport_probe.o were modules also.
Compiling just those in statically worked around the problem.  
Incidentally, the following would be a more minimal change,
though still an intolerable hack:
  plip_searchfor(parport, (0x3&(pb->name+7))) {
