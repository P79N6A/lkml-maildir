Hi,
If SoundBlaster driver supports full duplex mode why it does not work so
with speak_freely package? Is there any patch to provide this
functionality?  As I understand after looking at the driver sources, to
make it full duplex, the /dev/audio or /dev/dsp must be opened once as
read/write. In contrast, speak_freely has two separate programs to send
and receive audio streams, therefore it opens /dev/audio twice: one for
reading and another for writing. However, Linux audio driver for
SoundBlaster prohibits this. Are there any plans to provide real full
duplex in the future?
Thanks.
