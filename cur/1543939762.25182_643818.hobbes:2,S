Subject: [PATCH 0/3] some more firewire-sbp2 work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here come one triviality and two fixes, or at least attempts to do so.
I tried but couldn't recreate the conditions to put patch 2/3 into
effect.  But I did so with patch 3/3; that's easier due to a larger
window where this problem can happen.
1/3 firewire: fw-sbp2: unsigned int vs. unsigned
2/3 firewire: fw-sbp2: fix logout before login retry
3/3 firewire: fw-sbp2: retry login if scsi_device was offlined early
