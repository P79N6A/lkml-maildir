Where would the "other" oses implement this, as they don't even know the
pci device is a pci-e port?  How can the os send a PCI-E message without
talking directly to the chipset-specific controller chip?

That's good :)

The RHEL4 kernel is pretty old as far as PCI-E goes.  Can you try this
on a kernel.org release?  2.6.19.2 would be great at the least.  If not,
you're going to have to get your support from Red Hat on this issue :(
Any kernel log messages while the machine is idle before rebooting?
What tasks are running overnight that would cause writes to the disk?
