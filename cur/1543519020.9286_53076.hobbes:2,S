iBCS is never going to be able to use a stable binary interface. In its current
standalone incarnation, it's bad enough keeping it up to date in source form,
which is why a handful of people have been working on getting it into shape to
put into 2.3.
See 
ftp://ftp.infradead.org/pub/abi/
 for the patches, which also include 
support for Solaris/x86 and SCO UnixWare 7 binaries.
It was first submitted to Linus a week before the feature freeze. He wanted 
some changes, which took most of that week to accomplish. The patch was then 
resubmitted to him on the morning before he called the feature freeze. 
No response has been forthcoming since. 
Periodically, it's updated to 2.3.current and resubmitted, but the inclination
is wearing off, and I for one have just dropped the idea. Maybe I'll dust it 
off and try again when 2.5.0 comes out - or maybe not.
