... and for objects that have lifetime different from that of any module
this approach fucks up with procfs just as badly as with sysctl or sysfs.
Folks, _forget_ modules.  ->owner is OK for many things, but for stuff
like procfs it's not enough.  It only protects code.  procfs and sysfs
entries are _data_.  And in cases when it is OK the data is protected
by separate refcounts.
Folks, please, stop assuming that rmmod is the root of all evil and/or
place to deal with said evil.  Objects can be and are destroyed regardless
of rmmod.
