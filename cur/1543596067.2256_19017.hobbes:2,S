That was why I had the thought of doing it at compile time, based on a
magic list of versions only updated by Linus.
As I've been told that this won't work very well due to some people having
the temerity to disagree with him on driver versions shipped :), something
more flexible is needed.
I can't think of a neat way to do this, without knowing the source
tree the kernel came from though.
I think at least knowing what drivers are not stock might be useful.
Perhaps 
make distversion xxx
would add another string to KERNELRELEASE, setting a major releases "stock"
drivers, and letting anything that changes thereafter have a higher
default display level.
