That's a good point.  Also, even though the implementation may be 'lockless', 
there are still a lot of cachelines bouncing around, whether due to atomic 
counters or cmpxchg (in fact the latter will be worse than simple atomics).
It seems to me that RCU is basically rwlocks on steroids, which means that 
using it requires the same care to avoid starvation and/or other scalability 
problems (i.e. we'd better be really sure that a given codepath really should 
be using rwlocks before we change it).
