:-)  it's nice we all have a sense of humor.

That is incorrect.  The system behavior needed to generate an incomplete
entry is far more complicated and unlikely than what you describe.

If you do not care about performance then you're probably right, this is
fine.  If you are concerned about the time it takes to go through the
sequence of code, then probably not.
