But the real permissions tests are performed in notify_change.  I think
all this is consistent with how, for instance, fchmod works.  The
additional tests in fchmod which aren't here (IS_RDONLY and IS_APPEND)
would also apply to the case where a file name is given.  So, either the
code was inconsistent already are these tests are really not needed.
