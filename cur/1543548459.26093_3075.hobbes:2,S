The code is at vger.timpanogas.org.  If you want to review it, it's
there.  We are posting another MANOS kernel with full VM end of the
month.  The version Darren and I are hacking on now has the debugger
broken out as a module as a prelude to put it in Linux.  I am working on
your kdb stubs in 2.4 to put it in.  Darren is finishing the VM
subsystem.
