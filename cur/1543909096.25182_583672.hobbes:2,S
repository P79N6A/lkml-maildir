Much as I'd love to blame my mail client for this one...
Patch 4 of the 5 I sent was the only one with wrapping, and that 
wrapping existed in abundance in /drivers/char/rio/rio_linux.c file 
long before I got there.  Several lines in that file exceed 100 
columns, I think the "winner" was around 142.
I think tackling all the wordwrap issues would belong in a 
different patch as I'm just trying to clean up ioremap usage.  And, 
yes, I contributed *one more* wordwrap issue to the file, but when 
in Rome...
