I copied the fix to that problem from your new patch by hand and 
recompiled the kernel (that way I didn't have to rebuild the modules 
again).  Note I did not apply any of the fs specific changes.  I only did 
the VFS part of your patch that was actually necessary.  And I reverted my 
ncpfs fix so it is now again using the vfs supplied symlink helpers.
Having booted the new kernel and trying nautilus it worked fine accessing 
the same symlink that failed before, so your patch fixes the ncpfs 
problem as one would expect but always good to be sure.  (-:
btw. It may be an idea to switch smbfs to use the fixed generic symlink 
functions, too, so it benefits from symlink caching...
Best regards,
	Anton
