Hm. I compressed all the image drawing functions into accel_putcs which is 
used in many places. I then placed accel_putc() into fbcon_putc(). I could 
have accel_putcs() called in fbcon_putc(). The advantage is smaller 
amount of code. The offset is a big more overhead plus a function call. 
What do people think here?
