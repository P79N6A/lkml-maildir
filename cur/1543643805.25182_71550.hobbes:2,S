Do your drivers tie into the existing pci_hotplug core?  If so, great,
then your userspace interaction is done.
Do you have a pointer to your driver?

If you use the pci_hotplug core, any userspace program can call them
through pcihpfs.

Do you mean this document:
	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/talks/ols_2001_hotplug_paper/hotplug.ps
?  That just details how individual drivers can specify the proper
information so that /sbin/hotplug will load them when hardware that they
support is recognized.  It has nothing to do with the pci hotplug core,
for that you might want to take a look at:
	
http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5633
but to be honest, that article deals more with how to create a
filesystem for a driver.  Hopefully, you can glean some insight into how
the userspace interaction works from it.  If you still have questions,
please let me know..
I also have a very dumb program at:
	
http://www.kroah.com/linux/hotplug/
that can power up and down slots in a pci hotplug system.  I have an
even simpler bash script that does the same thing around here somewhere,
if people are interested.
Hope this helps,
