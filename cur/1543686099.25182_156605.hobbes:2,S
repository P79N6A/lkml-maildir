I actually want to "Take a new tv card, plug it into machine, start
up, use xine", without configuring remote ;-).

I think the right way is for application to just use buttons it knows
about. We already have some multimedia buttons on keyboard and some
more on remote...

I believe we should be able to make it work without lircd, but input
events with received codes is still better than current situation.
