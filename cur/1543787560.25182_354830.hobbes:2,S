You don't need to do it this way - and this will probably mess up the
SA1100 suspend code.  MTD map drivers should probably be converted to
the driver model rather than the core so that the PM ordering can be
correctly handled.
(Consider the case where there's flash on a daughter board accessed
over some kind of bridge.)
