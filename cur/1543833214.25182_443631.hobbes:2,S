Ok.  That one is a mess, and I almost recall seeing that.  A big
chunk of that is a general netlink socket problem.  Getting enough
context in a netlink socket is a challenge because you can't use current.
I do think solving that is achievable though.  Just very peculiar.

I just don't see it.    The accounting is about objects and the namespaces
are about names of those objects.

I completely agree that there are pieces that interlink.

That message is a terrible example.  Unless you are thinking of something
farther down that thread.  User space getting confused when it creates
a container is just an implementation of the container creation code.
Now I'm not certain what you mean by a clean process image, as there are always
left over pieces from the parent.  Clone creates a new task_struct.  exec replaces
the executable.  They both keep files open.
