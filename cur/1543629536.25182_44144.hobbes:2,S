Greets.  I made a very simple 2 line (plain english and all) patch for
pci.ids to support the SiS 740/961 chipset.  AFAICT it works, given that
the patched kernel can now detect my pci devices (unpatched can't).
The patch is against 2.5.13, backporting to 2.4.19 is simply a matter of
noting the right line numbers.
