I've only given this a high level review at this point, and while the 
patch looks okay on first pass, is there a way to move some of this 
functionality to either the rdma_cm or iw_cm?  I don't like the idea of 
every iwarp driver having to implement address/listen list maintenance. 
  I may have some ideas after re-examining it.
> Implementation Details:
There are a couple of areas that I made a note to look at in more detail 
(because I didn't understand everything that was happening), but I did 
have one minor nit - most uses of list_del_init can just be list_del.
