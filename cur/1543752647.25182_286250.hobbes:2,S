Let them have it! We can even chip in to run banner adds on freshmeat with
their name on it, I'm all game for that. Or create an RFC-like archive of
the vulnerabilities, ruled by the same rules - no changes after publishing.
Their names will be circulating around the internet forever.

I think it would be a non-issue if there was no drive towards keeping it
secret at all cost. It would be out in the open, nothing else, nothing more.

You've said they want glory, we can give it to them in many ways without
keeping their discoveries secret.
