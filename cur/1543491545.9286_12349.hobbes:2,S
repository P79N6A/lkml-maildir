I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. Seriously, I
am trying to debug an embedded TCP stack (that is only used
for a telnet command interface), this has been made more
interesting by the Linux TCP bug(s).

Not true. However, there does not seem to be enough detail in
either there or RFC 793 to determine what the correct behaviour
is in response to an ACK that ACKs all but your FIN (other's FIN
already received). Either that or I need to read 793 more slowly.
Any opinion on the dump I posted?
Giuliano.
