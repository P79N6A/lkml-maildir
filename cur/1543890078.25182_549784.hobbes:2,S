Yes, there's also the notifier chain for the hardware. However, very few 
drivers seem to use that - adb seems to be the only one still in the 
tree. For everything else, the device tree is used in exactly the same 
way as on x86. If it's safe on Macs but not on x86, then (as far as I 
can tell) it looks like it's only by luck.
Anyway. I've tested the following patch on a dual-core x86. No obvious 
issues yet, but I'll try to put it through a few hundred cycles.
