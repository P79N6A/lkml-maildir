very funny test really (it's like those games leading to an absurd), so
you actually notice that copy_user reads and writes 4 byte at once till
the last few bytes in the buffer :). I don't think anybody cares about
those kind of semantics of physical page overlapping in a "word" range
between pagecache destination and buffers source that is again the same
phys page.
If we use mmx unrolled loops faster on the athlons the "word"
granularity of copy_user would be 40bytes so it would be even more
noticeable (by luck in your above testcase then it would actually write
what you expect because the string is shorter and it wouldn't trigger a
roll of the unrolled loop).
An easy fix to resurrect the "expected" semantics of write, is to read
userspace and write pagecache in 1byte units, but that's slow, and I
don't think it really worth.  Let's declare this case undefined, it's
not a security matter and it's not useful either I think.

other minor side note: msync actually cannot make differences to this case.
