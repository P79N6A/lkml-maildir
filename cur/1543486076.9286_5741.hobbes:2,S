Subject: Why can't I raise open files on a 2.2.x kernel?

On 2.0.36, I used the open files patch that was available.
This worked great.  What do I do for kernel 2.2.x?  Also
what I don't understand is why the sysctl features that
should allow me to raise the limit have no effect.
echo 8192 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
does nothing as far as I can tell. 
My problem is a heavily loaded web server running out of
open file space.
Please give suggestions.  I'm somewhat desperate.
Thank You
