The technical details are that "signed", "sealed", "certified",
relate to policy. For years policy was not allowed to be included in
the kernel. In recent times, the kernel has become filthy with
policy.
For instance, a simple module that implements open/close has this
00000000 r __mod_license23
00000047 r __module_depends
00000020 r __mod_vermagic5
00000000 D __this_module
00000000 r ____versions
... used to enforce somebody's policy (whoever wrote the latest
module code), not your policy nor my policy, just someone's policy
which becomes the de-facto kernel "law". That's why there must
not be policy in the kernel because it's not possible to get
it right. What's right for you is wrong for another.
We let this start when there were problems with secret video
modules. Nobody wanted to debug a kernel that could be corrupted
by a module where nobody could read the source-code. So if there
isn't a MODULE_LICENSE("POLICY") then a 'tainted' mark goes
in any OOPS report. Well, they got away with that. It was
explained away as being "good" policy. Now they are making
more policy.
And, yes, the end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it, comes one interval
at a time.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
