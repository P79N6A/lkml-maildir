Said 'others' will tend to give you better worst-case IRQ latency than a
PeeCee with broken PCI host bridge and IDE controllers :)
And even if that weren't the case, you appear to be asserting that
because a problem may still be triggerable in a worst-case scenario with
certain hardware configurations, we shouldn't attempt to fix it at all.
With that I disagree.
