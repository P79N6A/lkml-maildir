Hi there!
I don't know if this is the right place, but I hope so.
I wrote a network-driver years ago for the 2.4er kernel's.
Now I ported it to the 2.6er kernel but I get some problems because
set_multicast_list is called from an interrupt and my driver want's to
free/allocate some memory.
Why did the driver work under 2.4, and now stops running on 2.6?
I had a look at 
http://lwn.net/Articles/30107/
:
Driver porting: Network drivers
but there was nothing about newly implemented soft-interrupts.
Thanks,
Martin
