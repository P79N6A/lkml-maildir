I have a box with no writeable media - it boots from a 720k
write-protected floppy, and mounts and ext2 cdrom for everything except
/etc and the kernel.
It is currently running 2.1.103 (since it was, at the time, the most
recent kernel that wouldn't crash) but it needs an upgrade.  Trouble is,
2.2 kernels are too big for the 720k floppy given that I need a (very
small) filesystem on there too.  So I started looking for things I could
rip out, and it occured to me that there is no way this box can ever swap,
so there's no point in the kernel being able to.
My understanding of the mm code is decidedly nonexistant, so I'm not sure
of the feasability of this, or even if it would help, but I would suspect
that the ability to swap adds a fair amount to the size of the kernel?  If
so, would it be possible to make it a config option?
