Is it possible to get a Linux system call number allocated for BProc?
(
http://sourceforge.net/projects/bproc
) I've been using arbitrary
system call numbers for a while but there have been collisions with
new kernel features.  I'd like to avoid that in the future.  BProc
currently works on 2.4.x kernels on x86, alpha and ppc (32bit).
Thanks,
