Pulled 2.6.23 tree and did a build
Added latest -linus on top of it.
Did a new build (x86_64).
As expected it failed due to wrong asm symlink but nothing
like the error Mike posted.
So I'm a bit puzzeled here.
I anyone can explain how to reproduce it I will chase it
but otherwise it will be left as a "consequence of
the x86 merge".
