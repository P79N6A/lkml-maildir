I don't know for sure whether ISAPNP or PNPBIOS support hot-plug,
but ACPI does, and ACPI devices are being integrated into the
PNP subsystem via PNPACPI.
One example is HP sx2000 hardware that supports hot-plug of cells.
Each cell contains CPUs, memory, I/O bridges, and some miscellaneous
hardware like on-board serial devices.  All this stuff is described
by ACPI, and we'd like to use PNP drivers like 8250_pnp.c when we can.
