I think that VMWare actually disables door locking and control it
manually with an ioctl to get complete control over it. That's
what they told me, anyway, but not having the source does not
allow me to check. It sounds like that is causing problems -
I bet that they never re-enable door locking again. Take the
problem up with them.
