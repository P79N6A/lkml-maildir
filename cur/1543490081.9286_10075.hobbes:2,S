Indeed.  Over LinuxWorld I spoke with Linus about the possibility of
adding raw IO to the kernel, and we ended up with a design which
separated out the actual IO from the business of setting up the user
space mappings by creating a separate abstraction layer describing the
physical memory into which the kernel can do the read or write.  This
already looks suspiciously like IO-Lite, especially if we make these
io_regions visible to user space.
