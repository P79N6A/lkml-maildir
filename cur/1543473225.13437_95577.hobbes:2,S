Heheh... But TOO MANY cards, AFAIS :( This one too...
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc 215GB [Mach64 GB] (rev 5c)
        Subsystem: Unknown device 1002:0088
        Flags: bus master, stepping, medium devsel, latency 64
        Memory at e6000000 (32-bit, prefetchable)
        I/O ports at d000
        Memory at e5000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
I guess it's something strange at the PCI probing, because lspci finds my ATI board id 
and the signature _CAN_ be found in aty.h.
