arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig is included there since that is the right place
for the config options to show up.

You would need something like:
source "arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig"
	depends on S390
But that is not implemented and I doubt it will since deleting parts of
the kernel tree is not something that is required to work.
