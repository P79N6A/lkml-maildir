There is nothing wrong with this partition table,
from a Linux point of view.
But lots of things may be wrong in the Windows - Linux cooperation.
Windows has its own data independent of the partition table.
So, if you change the partition table Windows may still use
the original partitioning.
Something else that may be bad: type 5 becomes type f when LBA
should be used. Since you are past cylinder 1024 you do not
want the CHS data to be used.
Something else that may be bad: DOS/Windows expects that type 5/f is
their own. At least the first partition in an extended should
be a DOS/Windows one, otherwise some programs will be unhappy.
Etc.
Try first f instead of 5, that is the easiest change.
