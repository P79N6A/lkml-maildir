There's a similar argument for queasiness in all the other (8 or more)
instances of the idiom.  I think we originally adopted (and I furthered)
this pte_unmap(pte - 1) idiom because in the majority of architecture's
configurations pte_unmap does nothing at all, so we resented assigning
a pointless variable in some critical loops.

Either of wli's patches is fine with me.  There are several levels on
which try_to_unmap_cluster is harder to understand than the others,
and no good reason to resist the variable assignment.
We could rewrite pte_unmap to avoid the issue completely, since its
job is to unmap (or pretend to unmap) KM_PTE0's pte if the address
is in the fixmap area: but changing it to tolerate an off-by-one
address gives a queasy feeling too.
Thanks,
Hugh
