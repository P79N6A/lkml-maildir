I found the problem... in kernel/sched.c around the 2.4.7 time frame
wait_for_completion() and other code was added.  It uses a new
completion structure that has a wait_queue_haed_t embedded in it.
In wait_for_completion() and other places they use spin_lock_*()
calls that cause the OOPs.
In order to do some of the clean up you suggested I needed to and
some macros to wait.h.  To fix wait_for_completion() and others
those same macros will be needed.  I'm going to fix the wait_for_completion()
stuff first and then get back to the sema stuff.
