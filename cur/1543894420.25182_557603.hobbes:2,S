I have an LSI Logic card attached to a RAID. The RAID occasionally 
reports SCSI bus resets,although that might be unrelated because I 
have other units of this RAID with the same complaint, but then this 
just recently was reported by the card:
Jun 14 19:19:51 [kernel] [86189.359115] mptbase: ioc0: 
LogInfo(0x110b0000): F/W: Invalid Phase Change
which repeated many times
and then
Jun 14 19:19:53 [kernel] [86191.654386] mptbase: ioc0: 
LogInfo(0x11040000): F/W: SYNC Offset Error
which repeated many times
There is also some white crud on the card surface, pictured here:

Any comments on what might be going on?
