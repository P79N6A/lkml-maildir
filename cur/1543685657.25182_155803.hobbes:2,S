Ah. There's the answer. You've totally changed the behaviour of the 
application in question by moving to the text console. No longer is it the 
sizable cpu hog that it is when it's in the foreground on X, so you've 
totally changed it's behaviour and how it is treated.

Depends on whether the scheduler has decided firmly "you're interactive or 
not". 
Your question of course is can this be changed? Well of course everything 
_can_ be... It may be simple tuning. In the meantime the answer is don't 
switch to the text console. (Doc it hurts when I do this... Well don't do 
that). Might be useful for you to see how long it has run when it recovers, 
and how long when it no longer recovers.

Wine, women and song^H^H^H games and scheduling are not a good mix. It's not 
your fault. Please do not hold back any reports.
