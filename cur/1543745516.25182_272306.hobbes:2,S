Actually Fabio told me that his oops was fixed by the patch present in
2.6.10-rc2. The problem is that his device needs special handling which
I do not know how to provide, so it does not work in the end. I hope it
will resolve itself eventually, as I get testers.
There was one last oops from Martin Schleminger ("Sahara") which I think
I fixed but I need a confirmation before pushing to Greg. Apparently, it
only happens on kernels with preempt enabled. If anyone knows of any other
problems, I'm all ears.
