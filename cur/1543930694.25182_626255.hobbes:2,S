A quick comparison of the trace sections for udevd and net.agent indicates
those traces are identical: none of the function names in the traces appear
to be what you might be looking for, i.e., the processes appear to have been
waiting for an event of some kind, and woke up long enough to process the
SysRq-T keyboard interrupt and the corresponding action.
Hmm...  Ok...  The state information itself is probably more useful in
this context.  Here's the info for net.agent:
net.agent      S      fffffc000032c37c   0    895    1
  fffffc0000743b10  0000000000000010  fffffc00004f3b5c  fffffc00007601a8
    0000000000000001  0000000000000074  fffffc0000747758  fffffc00230f0000
    0000000000000007  0000000000000007  fffffc00004f390c  0000000000000010
    fffffc00004e9eb8  fffffc00230f0000  0000000000000014  fffffc0023085140
    0000000000000001  0000000000000014  fffffc00001de000  0000000000000001
    fffffc000055dcfc  fffffc0023085140  fffffc00232788c0  0000000000000001
Addresses of presumed interest from System.map:
fffffc000032c000 t do_wait
fffffc0000740000 D init_thread_union
fffffc00004f3b40 t sysrq_handle_showstate
fffffc00007601a8 d sysrq_showstate_op
fffffc0000747758 D console_printk
fffffc002...  not in System.map (module?) -- I'll track this down later
   if needed.
fffffc00004f3850 T __handle_sysrq
fffffc00004e9850 t kbd_event
fffffc00001...  not in System.map (?? begins with fffffc0000300000 A swapper_pg_dir)
fffffc000055dc30 t input_pass_event
