Hi Marcelo,
2.4.30-rc1 works fine here on athlon-SMP and sparc64-smp. BTW, the athlon
uses the e1000 driver (which has been updated since 2.4.29) with no trouble
at all.
I'll post a 2.4.29-hf5 in a few hours, just the time to put the thing online,
it already builds on the same machines.
Cheers,
Willy
