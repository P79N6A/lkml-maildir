We do this for Caldera OpenLinux 2.3. And an external maintained list
is a PITA to be frank.
I generate this list from the kernelsources by using a rather large 
perlscript. There are several different kinds of specifying PCI ids
within the source, either in tables, or direct, by using for() loops
and more.
I do this for _every_ new patchlevel.

The module has to be updated anyway, if the detection code has to
detect new Ids.
So by using one PCI id resource within the module itself, there is
only one place to maintain.

Yes, but autogenerated from the kernelsourcetree!
I would suggest:
- Add easy parsable pci ids to the modules.

- Use usermode scripts to load the modules.
Ciao, Marcus
