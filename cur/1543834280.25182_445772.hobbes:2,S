Hey guys,
I am running a 2.6.18-rc1-git7 kernel on my IBM Thinkpad x60s, with
CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK=y
Whenever the computer is inserted into the dock, ACPI seems to bomb:

I was wondering if anyone could help me solve this problem, I believe it
is keeping me from using my cdrom drive on the dock since it does not
show up in /dev.  I have also contacted Kristen Accardi about it, who I
believe wrote the dock code... but I wasn't sure if this is a further
problem in ACPI somewhere.
Here is my full config:

Thanks!
