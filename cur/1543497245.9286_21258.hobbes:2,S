Hi Folks -
A couple of years ago there was a big stink on the linux-admin list about the
I2O bus standard developed by intel and other large corporations.  The
prevailing view back then was that this standard would most likely die before
broad adoption occurred.  Looking through the intel web site I was horrified to
learn that I2O is still very much alive.  My question relates to how I2O and
Linux have evolved since 1996.  Has the Linux community been granted access to
the I2O spec?  If not is there any possibility they might in the future?  Is
there talk about a competing open standard alternative to I2O?  I am not
interested in starting a big debate.  I just want to know where we stand with
regard to I2O.
Thanks.............
