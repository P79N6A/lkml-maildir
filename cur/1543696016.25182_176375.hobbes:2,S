Someone sent me a private e-mail message suggesting that I apply this
patch that Matthew Dharm posted to the linux-usb-devel list yesterday
and see if that would restore the write throughput to linux-2.4
levels.
The patch limits the size of the transfers, and can be found at

I am happy to report that this patch has restored the write throughput
to the same speed that it was on linux-2.4.
Problem solved.    Thanks much.
