So, couldn't your NAPI patch be used by drivers that are updated, and
let Ingo's patch be a catch-all for un-fixed drivers?  As we move foward,
more and more drivers support your version, and Ingo's patch becomes less
utilized.  So long as the patches are tuned such that yours keeps Ingo's
from being triggered on devices you support, there should be no real
conflict, eh?
