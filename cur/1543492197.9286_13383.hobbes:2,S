Your server is for some reason not allowing access to the rpc.statd
port. Is it running rpc.statd?

This is fine... Just a stale file handle on an unused dentry.

This is more serious: it indicates that the RPC layer has some
socket-related problems communicating with your host. In principle it
should only occur while your server is rebooting (when the net is up,
but the port unavailable 'cos the server hasn't yet started). If it is
occurring across an active net with a bona-fide live NFS server, I'd
be interested in seeing a tcpdump (please use the '-s 256' option in
order to pick up the NFS header details).
NB: The 'ac' kernel series will probably handle this error in a better
way (it pauses for 5 seconds, then retries the connection).
Cheers,
