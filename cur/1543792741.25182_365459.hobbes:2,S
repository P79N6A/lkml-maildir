Subject: [PATCH] Remove read-only check from inode_update_time().
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
The read-only check in inode_update_time() (or file_update_time() as it is 
now in -mm) is unnecessary as the VFS better have done all the read-only 
checks and aborted much earlier in the file write code paths where 
inode/file_update_time() is only called from.
(In case you were not following the ntfs discussion, Christoph Hellwig 
agreed that check is unnecessary and can be removed.)
Patch against latest Linus git tree is below, please apply.  If you prefer 
a patch on top of Christoph's file_update_time() check please let me 
know...
Best regards,
	Anton
