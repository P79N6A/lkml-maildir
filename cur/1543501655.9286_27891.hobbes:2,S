I think the right thing would be to check both (base,3) and (base,8).
The reason is that the double request will work for the moment, but
when we get a PnP device manager, it will create a resource entry for
the full size of the region before the parport driver ever gets a
chance to look at it.  So the double request would then start to fail.
