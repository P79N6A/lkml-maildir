This one is a case where the option makes no sense by itself,
it provides the core common code for other front-end drivers.
The documentation exists in those front end drivers, which
in turn auto-matically select and enable this config option.
It would be nice if there was a Kconfig way to not provide
this thing at all unless one of the front-ends got selected
but on the otherhand I like how anyone can select it and thus
test the build of it :-)
