Oh wait, I mispoke... there is another formulation of the patch that hasn't 
yet been posted for review.  Instead of having the nopagedone hook, it turns 
the entire do_no_page into a hook, per hch's suggestion, but leaves in the 
->nopage hook, which makes the patch small and obviously right.  I need to 
post that version for comparison, please bear with me.
IMHO, it's nicer than the ->nopagedone form.
Regards,
Daniel
