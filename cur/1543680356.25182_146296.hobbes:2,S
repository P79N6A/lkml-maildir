Good chance that you're on a SuSE 8.2 system. Although it says gcc 3.3 it
is in fact a beta of gcc 3.3. I was told (by Adrian Bunk) that the final
version 3.3 does not give these warnings. And remember, there is a -Werror
in the Makefile which makes the compilation to give an exit code 1 in case
of warnings.
