Hey Ingo.. Sorry to keep breaking stuff on you, but.. ;)
Summary: Looks like CONFIG_NET_PKTGEN=y gives -V0.7.38-03 indigestion.
I retrofitted 0.7.38-03 onto -rc3-mm1, and at boot it wedged up hard scrolling
an error message.  Looked like a 'scheduling while atomic' error coming from
net/pktgen.o.   Sorry for the incomplete traceback, but it locked before
userspace came up, and I don't have hardware handy for a serial console..
I found a CONFIG_NET_PKTGEN=Y in the config, rebuilt with =n, and the resulting
kernel boots fine (am using it as I type). Vanilla -rc3-mm1 also boots fine
with the PTKGEN=y setting (as did 2.6.10-mm1-V0.7.34-01, the last -mm I built
with a -RT patch).  I haven't tried a vanilla -rc3-V0.7.38-03, but I don't see
anyplace -mm1 hits pktgen.c
If the above isn't enough to track down the issue, feel free to let me know
what you'd like me to try next.
