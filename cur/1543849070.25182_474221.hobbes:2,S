OK, netdev tree is the way to get this into mainline. Mainline tree
already has include/asm-arm/arch-omap/gpioexpander.h, but not
drivers/i2c/chips/gpio_expander_omap.c.
The gpio_expander_omap.c (which really is TI PCF8574) issues need
to be sorted out with the I2C folks, so meanwhile I suggest to continue
these two independently of each other. Especially since the IrDA drive
driver is usable on H2.

I'll push it, I guess I must have missed the original message.
