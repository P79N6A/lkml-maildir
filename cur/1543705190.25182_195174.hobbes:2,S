Okay. It seems that XFS uses its own locking with xfs_ilock() etc,
so I am not sure if this should be fixed by using down(&inode->i_sem)
or by using xfs_ilock().
Perhaps xfs_ilock() should also get the inode->i_sem semaphore
in the XFS_ILOCK_EXCL case ?
Also, there are one or two more places that call i_size_write()
that should be looked at I guess.
Ofcourse I'll test any patches you send me.
Mike.
