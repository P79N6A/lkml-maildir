Such a lock certainly exists, but I doubt it is public at the moment.

This is costly.

By callback, do you mean port forwarding as Rudolf Marek did, or more
simple "stop touching the device" and "you can touch the device again"
sort of signals? If the latter, this is no different from a mutex.

What benefit do you see compared to a lock taken by both AML and the
hardware monitoring drivers?
Care to submit a sample implementation?
