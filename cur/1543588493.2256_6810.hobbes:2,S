99.9999% of problems don't involve querying the set of maintainers of
Confg.in files. The system is optimised to the general case of queries people
need to make. It also happens to be accessible to people who are not
kernel gurus because it uses roughly English terms for the maintainership
and area.
The .0001% case isnt interesting. Thats the difference between real world 
systems and theory.
