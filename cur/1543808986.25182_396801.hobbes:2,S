Good idea, which probably already works with current Linux with ext3. But we should be not limited to JDB systems. Your idea works only with JDB, so your idea (despite of being a good idea) is a hack.

How it is worse than to lose data on power failures with the standard Linux memory I/O cache?
Moreover so we can lose LESS, as Flash memory will preserve swap content unlike RAM.
