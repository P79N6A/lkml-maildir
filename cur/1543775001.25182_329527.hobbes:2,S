OK.  I agree with that.  Of course, Reiser4 can always present both
interfaces, just like it presented two interfaces to the stat data --
the regular interface and the metas (now '...') interface -- before
file-as-dir got disabled by default.

I don't know if VFS is the right place for it, but I agree that it would
be good to make it accessible to all filesystems.

Yes.  It's handled by NSWorkspace which is approximately equivalent to
this sort of thing being handled by GnomeVFS or the KDE equivalent.  Of
course the problem with handling it in userspace is that behaviour isn't
uniform -- applications that don't use NSWorkspace (e.g. some
command-line utils, programs ported over from UNIX, etc.) won't have the
same behaviour.  Whether or not that is an actual problem seems to be
debatable.  (I don't use MacOS X, but I've done some programming in
GNUstep.)
Another problem is that it only works with bundle files.  e.g. I can't
add an icon to a regular txt file.  Tiger now supports xattrs, which you
could use for that functionality, but then we run into the problem again
of not being able to edit it with regular applications.

Looking forward to the flamewar that happens when Namesys decides that
file-as-dir is ready to be turned on again. ;-)
