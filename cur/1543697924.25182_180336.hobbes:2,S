Unpatched 2.6.0-test11 here, using anticipatory scheduler
What should I expect to see occuring when this is executed?
Here, after a few initial cycles of the numbers getting larger, then 
stepping smaller and restarting the rise, eventually (a minute or so) 
the numbers started to rise and never stopped till I killed it.
The first 2 numbers always matched, and a much smaller pair near the 
end of the line always matched, the first pair being something above 
30,000 when I stopped it after about 2 1/2 minutes.
