Ah... This is the mysterious mwdma configuration in smart mode, right?
Thanks for fixing this.

This is the lbal/nsect SRST problem, right?

I think this is better done by mode_filter callback which is guaranteed
to be called before any actual mode configuration is performed and in
device order (master then slave).
Thanks.
