It's a variation of the sleeper bonus. Let's assume two running tasks 
which have been running for 95ms and 105ms and a time slice of 10ms, the 
average is thus 100ms. If the new task has been sleeping for a while it 
starts at 90ms, if the task had been running lately it doesn't get this 
bonus again.

That would be equivalent to simply clearing wait_runtime in CFS.
