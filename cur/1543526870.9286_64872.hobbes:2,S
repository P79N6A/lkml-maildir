     programmer mindset has also included such things as
	 sizeof(int) == sizeof(*)
     and
	 sizeof(long) == sizeof(*)
     And, just like what happened in these cases (well, it's still happening
     in the sizeof(long) == sizeof(*) case) people will learn.
     I'd love to see time64_t be a non-scalar type and force people to
     use time64diff(), time64add(), time64sub(), et al to extract the
     contents of it instead of the seductively simple approach of using
     scalars that we have now.
