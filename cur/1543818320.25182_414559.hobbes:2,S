proc_task_readdir:
	first_tid() returns old_leader
	next_tid()  returns new_leader
						de_thread:
							old_leader->group_leader = new_leader;
	next_rid()  returns old_leader again,
	because it is not thread_group_leader()
	anymore

Yes!
I think I understand why we had the reason to reparent 'leader'
in the past. We used to set leader->exit_state = EXIT_ZOMBIE,
so without reparenting current's parent could have a bogus do_wait()
result if this do_wait() happens before release_task(leader).
Now we set leader->exit_state = EXIT_DEAD, which means this task
is not visible to do_wait().
Oleg.
