Hi Tim,
Again, thanks for the excellent bug reporting. 
This is actually a different problem (and not my code again, thank
goodness).  I think a few of these got fixed in current -mm.  According
to Peter Z, these mean:

So, this looks like an on-stack ACPI structure that got initialized
wrongly.  At least we already have those dudes on the cc. :)
But, this might also get fixed by reverting the patch as Linus just did.
It might just be best to wait for another -mm release and see how it
settles out.
