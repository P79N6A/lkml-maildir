I seem to be able to create files in linux that are 2+ gigs when there is
only 100 MB free...infact I can create dozens of them without problem, and
the disk usage shown by "df" is unaffected, and "du" reports only 4 blocks
on the files. Heres the code that does it :
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define FILESIZE        2000000000
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    FILE *bf;
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Syntax: %s filename\n", *argv);
        return 1;
    }
    bf = fopen(argv[1], "w+");
    if (!bf) {
        perror("fopen");
        return 2;
    }
    fseek(bf, FILESIZE, SEEK_SET);
    fputc('?', bf);
    fclose(bf);
    printf("Done\n");
    return 0;
}
(there may be errors, I just typed in this in the message and didn't compile
it, but you get the idea)
