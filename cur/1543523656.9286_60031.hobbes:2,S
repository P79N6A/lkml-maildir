Humpf... You know, there may be a better way to do it. What would you say
about:
$ cat /proc/drivers/block/devices
0300[40] hda
0340[40] hdb
2100[40] hde
2140[40] hdf
0800[10] sda
etc.
If anything, it simplifies MAKEDEV-style scripts big way. And has a benefit
of making them work with any allocation scheme for device numbers. Format
is obvious: "%04x[%x] %s", first_device_number, amount, name. If you
really want it we might add driver name in the end of the thing, but that
might be an overkill. Comments?
