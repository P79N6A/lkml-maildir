Will this problem be fixed with the Linux kernel to bring it into
(closer) compliance with ANSI/ISO standards?  IMHO, it can only be a
good thing to have code which is (close to) 100% compliant with
recognized and widely used standards.
Which sections of code are affected by this?

That shouldn't be too hard to do. ;)  But, it's just a workaround, isn't
it?  See above question...

I'm not sure exactly what the problem is here.  The last I heard, the
"approved" compiler for 2.0.x was 2.7.2.3.  Which is strange, in my
mind.  I started using 2.8.1 when it first appeared, and had absolutely
no problems with kernel compiles, except for a problem with X with >
2.0.35, which a patch fixed (said patch was never included in the kernel
for some strange reason, although it was well-tested and stable, and
needed).  Later, when I got around to actually installing RH 5.1, there
was egcs. Never had a problem there, either.  All my kernels were stock,
too.  Am I just an anomaly?
IMHO, based on what little I actually know, it would be a very good idea
to make the kernel code as ANSI compliant as possible (irrespective of
what gcc does).  This makes it more practical to compile the kernel with
other than gcc, supposing one wanted to...and used an ANSI-compliant
compiler.
