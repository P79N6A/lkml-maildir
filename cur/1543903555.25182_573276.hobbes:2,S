Hi Walter,
Thanks for reporting this.

Did this happen when you were resuming from a suspend-to-ram/disk?

Surprising, that's a WARN_ON(!irqs_disabled()) but IRQs are disabled
alright on that codepath. OTOH, __make_request() is heavily goto-driven,
uses the non-save/restore variants of spin_lock_irq, and does not even
balance locks / unlocks for some error paths ... gaah.

I've reattached them in this mail, for linux-pm to see.

If you're resuming from a suspend I don't see how you can avoid
giving the resume= parameter (unless you somehow specify some
default at build-time ...)

Yes, please post your .config also.
