The problem is that I want them to be presented together.  They look
like a pile of different stuff, but they're actually Infiniband NodeInfo
and PortInfo structures.  And yes, they are that ugly.
These files fall into the same categories as the atomic_counters and
atomic_snapshots files you raised objections to earlier; it actually
makes sense to look at them as a whole, not their constituent parts.
In the earlier round of review, people suggested that I use netlink for
stuff like this, but I quickly decided I'd rather gnaw my leg off than
use the netlink API.
I'm thinking at this point that I should just route this information
through the /dev/ipath_sma char device, and maybe
add /dev/ipath_counters%d and /dev/ipath_stats to go with it.  I think
that's a pretty crummy approach that sysfs solves more cleanly, but
there you go.
