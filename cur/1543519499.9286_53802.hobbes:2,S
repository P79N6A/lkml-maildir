Hi Alan,
  I saw in your TODO list for 2.4 which you post into linux-kernel that
you have new i2c prepared for integration with Linus kernels. Do you
have some timeframe to merge with Linus or for publicly available prepatch?
  I'm currently beta-testing patch with dualhead G400 support and it 
currently uses good old kernel i2c code. If we are going to replace this 
i2c with lmsensors one, I have to wait some time, probably... But I'd like
to get driver into 2.4...
                                                Best regards,
                                                        Petr Vandrovec
                                                        vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
P.S.: You have December 14th twice on your diary page.
