Well, it looks like this UART has a differing behaviour to proper 16xxx
UARTs - it says that the BI will be cleared when a stop bit is received
in addition to when the LSR is read.  That means that unless you check
the LSR while the break condition is present, you may never know one
existed.
Standard 8250-compatible UARTs only clear the BI when the LSR is read.
As for the rest of the description, it's quite loose.  It doesn't really
say under what conditions the BI bit is set, but I suggest that your UART
repeatedly (and incorrectly) sets the BI bit when no *new* break condition
exists.  That would certainly explain your behaviour.
Again, standard 8250-compatible UARTs don't do this.
Not sure how to fix this without other people seeing a behavioural
change.
