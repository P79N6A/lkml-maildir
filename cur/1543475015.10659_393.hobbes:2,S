Hi All,
On 2.2.0.pre4 I get ppp problems which do not come up under 2.2.0.pre3 or pre1,
I couldn't boot 2.2.0.pre2 so I can't make a comparsion here. PPP has been 
compiled
into the kernel, not as a module in all cases of testing. /dev/modem -> 
/dev/ttyR0 the
first port on the Comtrol Rocket board (also compiled in at config time). 
I tried this over ten times to ensure it was not just a problem at ISP end.
2.2.0.pre1, pre3 dialled, authenticated ten times each, no problems. I am 
running
pppd 2.3.5 and pam-0.59 under RH5.0 + updates distribution. ppplog shows the 
same error.
 
/var/log/messages section follows:
