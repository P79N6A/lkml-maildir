Existing userland doesn't, though.

Yes - dev_t has legitimate reasons to exist.  kdev_t is a garbage
and its presence means that we need to fugure out what real objects
should be used in that particular context.
Note that in many cases these objects are, indeed, different.  So
blanket replacement of kdev_t with pointer to some type is *wrong*.
E.g. on the block side, we used to use kdev_t when we actually needed
	* filesystem
	* device node in some fs
	* device number from userland POV
	* struct block_device *, with associated cache, etc.
	* "disk" from driver POV (what had become struct gendisk *)
	* pointer to driver-specific data structure.
All of the above have different lifetime rules.  That alone means that
there is no hope in hell for a natural object unifying these uses.
And this information ("what kind of object are we talking about") was
simply not there - most of the stuff I'd been doing in 2.5 was *adding*
*that* *information* *into* *source*.  Several megabytes in 400-odd
patches...
Similar work needs to be done for character devices.  Then (and only then)
kdev_t can go.  Note that dev_t has only one legitimate use - it's when
we are talking about userland-supplied number without refering to internal
objects.
And yes, these conversions serve useful purpose - they mark the places
that need work.  Simple "oh, we'll just s/kdev_t/dev_t/" is not a good
step - more often than not it would just propagate dev_t to the places
where it doesn't belong.
