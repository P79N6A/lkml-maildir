It was a simple misconception.
I fixed them in the take3-patch.

I didn't imagine such a situation. Indeed, such thing may happen.

I think we can't apply this approach for the implementation
of avc_update_node(), because execution context isn't permitted to block.
I changed my opinion and implementation of avc_update_node().
If kmalloc() returns NULL in avc_update_node(), it returns -ENOMEM.
But this effect of changing the prototype is limited, because only
avc_has_perm_noaudit() and avc_update_cache() call avc_update_node().
Even if avc_update_node() return -ENOMEM to avc_has_perm_noaudit(),
avc_has_perm_noaudit() can ignore it, because the purpose is only
to control the audit-log floods.
This adverse effect is only that audit-logs are printed twice.
Nobody calls avc_update_cache(), which is only defined.
Some other trivial fixes are as follows:
- All list_for_each_entry() were replaced by list_for_each_entry_rcu().
- All spin_lock()/spin_unlock() were replaced by spin_lock_irqsave()
  /spin_unlock_restore().
- In avc_node_insert(), if an entry with the same ssid/tsid/tclass as new
  one exists, the older entry is replaced by the new one.
Thank you for the opinion as a specialist of RCU!
