As the separated function is called about once in a blue moon, it
hardly matters.  I'd probably rather it wasn't inlined so as to be
sure it doesn't clutter the L-1 cache when it isn't needed, but that's
the sort of thing I really want to leave to the compiler.
Maybe it would be good to stick an 'unlikely' or 'likely' in raid10d
to tell the compiler how likely a read error is...
