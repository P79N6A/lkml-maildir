Yes.  On some systems, /var and /tmp are the _only_ read-write filesystems.

No, of course not; that's why I suggest it's up to the init scripts to
make sure that /proc/mounts gets propagated to /var/whatever.  They
usually will know enough about what's going on to take care of any
special cases and add any extra info that's relevant.
If a program such as `mount' wants to use mtab and finds that it's not
present (possibly because /var isn't mounted), it should either use
/proc/mounts instead, or just ignore it.

[/var/run is for `non-persistant' files]

It will simply appear to mount as if the file isn't present, in which
case it should gracefully stop trying to use it [see above].
It seems like the attempt here is to somehow make everything just work
magically _without_ modifying any tools that use mtab -- and I think
that just isn't doable in every situation.
