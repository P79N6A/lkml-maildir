Sun UltraSparc 10
kernel 2.4.20
eth2: Alteon AceNIC Gigabit Ethernet at 0x1ff02900000, irq 6,7d0
  Tigon II (Rev. 6), Firmware: 12.4.11, MAC: 00:60:cf:20:92:fc
  PCI bus width: 32 bits, speed: 33MHz, latency: 64 clks
eth2: Firmware up and running
unplugging the utp cable, and plugging back in gives :
eth2: 10/100BaseT link UP
eth2: Optical link DOWN
eth2: 10/100BaseT link UP
but this card is not an Fibre (Optical) card ?
also ethtool gives incorrect information :
(ethtool 1.7)

card is connected to 100mbit switch at full duplex
and i think Auto-negotiation is on ?
