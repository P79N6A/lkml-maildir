Not so.
task 1: sched_rr, priority 1, takes mutex
task 2: sched_rr, priority 2, cpu hog, infinite loop
task 3: sched_rr, priority 99, tries to get mutex
And now tasks 1 and 3 are starved forever.  Arguably bad application 
design, but it demonstrates a case where applications can starve other 
applications.
