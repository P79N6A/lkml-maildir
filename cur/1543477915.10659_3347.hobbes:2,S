I was the one with the nonstandard APM-BIOS. Ok:
Processor: AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor 300 MHz
Stepping: A
Flags: fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 syscr mmx 3dnow
Board: Gigabyte 5AX v1.08, Award BIOS 4.51
SCSI storage controller: NCR 53c810 (rev 18)
Multimedia video controller: 3Dfx Voodoo (rev 2)
VGA compatible controller: S3 Inc. ViRGE/DX or /GX (rev 1). (it is a DX)
IDE interface: Acer Labs M5229 TXpro (rev 32)
Ethernet controller: DEC DC21140 (rev 34) (tulip driver)
Memory: 128MB
ISA bridge: Acer Labs M1533 Aladdin IV (rev 180)
PCI bridge: Acer Labs Unknown device (rev 4)
      Vendor id=10b9. Device id=5243.
      Slow devsel.  Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=6
Host bridge: Acer Labs Unknown device (rev 4).
      Vendor id=10b9. Device id=1541.
      Slow devsel.  Master Capable.  Latency=64.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000.
/ and /usr is on IDE, /var and /home on SCSI and I was compiling on SCSI.
Distribution is S.u.S.E. 6.0 - glibc; .config is attached

I had SIGSEGV and "out of memory" from the compiler and did a reboot to 2.0.36
immediately. I use the pre-series since they are out and did not have these
problems, although some days ago the machine started trashing the HD, the
load hit the sky and I had to press the reset button, but I thought this was a
userlevel problem, because I was able to move the mouse with X, eeeh the pointer
jumped sometimes in the direction I had moved the mouse some seconds ago ;-)
I use experimental features
- PCI bridge optimization
- IP: ipautofw masq support
- IP: ipportfw masq support
- The IPv6 protocol (not used)
Maybe the PCI bridge?
