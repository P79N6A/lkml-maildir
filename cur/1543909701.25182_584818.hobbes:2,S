My keyboard works fine for days, with kernels up to and including
2.6.23-rc2 . I have booted into 2.6.23-rc3-$whatever this morning, and
after 10-15 minutes the keyboard stopped working.  The mice which were
plugged in the keyboard's built-in hub were fine though.
The first time it happened, I removed the keyboard and got the oops
that started this thread.  The second time, I just logged-in remotely
and rebooted, and the reboot process stopped at "KILLING all
processes" step.  I simply reset the box and rebooted into 2.6.23-rc2
and it is fine since (over an hour ago).
Regards,
florin
