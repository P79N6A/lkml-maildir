Hmm, now I'm a bit confused. I just tested my disks again and the results
I'm getting now seem to be ok. (I did the other tests a few days ago.) I
now get:
/dev/hda: (Maxtor 90845D4)
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  0.89 seconds =71.91 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in  2.17 seconds =14.75 MB/sec
/dev/hdb: (Seagate ST31722A)
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  0.88 seconds =72.73 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in  5.53 seconds = 5.79 MB/sec
/dev/hdc: (Maxtor 90845D4)
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  0.87 seconds =73.56 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in  2.17 seconds =14.75 MB/sec
/dev/md0: (hda & hdc in RAID0 config)
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  0.88 seconds =72.73 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in  1.62 seconds =19.75 MB/sec
/dev/sda: (external zipdrive)
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   64 MB in  0.92 seconds =69.57 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in 38.05 seconds = 0.84 MB/sec
Also, I find it a bit odd you CAN test IDE CD-ROMS, but not SCSI ones.
