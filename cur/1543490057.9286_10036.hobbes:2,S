Right, since audio data don't have ECC in the first place. That's part of
the problem, since if you get an error you'll have to read again instead of
correcting it in software (if not too many bits get flipped).
If there was a coice, I'd rather do ECC in software. :-/

You'd be unpleasantly surprised just how many CD-ROM drives mess this one up.
Just talk to your drives with cdparanoia and watch the - and + signs march
across the screen.  :-(  I have a (fairly new, too) laptop CDROM drive
which can't grab audio reliably at all; even cdparanoia just hangs or gives
up after some time.
The German magazine c't usually does audio grab tests and digital output
quality tests when they examine new CDROM drives. Unfortunately such things
are largely ignored by the "gee, a 50x CDROM drive, wow cool man" rags.
