Sorry, I tought you were asking for a ioctl range just for you.
It seems fair to me to have a private ioctl range where anyone should
use anytime in the future, just for tests and private use. Althought,
I can't help you too much with that, you will have to wait to the true
maintainers, I was just trying to give you ideas comparing it to my
case and which approach I would take.
Just wait until someone more useful answer you :)
