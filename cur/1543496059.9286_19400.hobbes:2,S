Subject: console_init patch for kbdless systems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

To me it's a bug but to others it will look like a non-feature.  When both
VT console and serial console support are built in to a kernel image, the
kernel blindly attempts to initialize the keyboard before finding there is
no normal VGA console and defaults to serial console support.  This hangs
the system on boards where there is no keyboard controller present.
I've attached a patch to tty_io.c that checks a vt console present flag
before attempting to initialize a keyboard.  That solves the problem as
neatly as possible (AFAIKT).  If anybody sees any problems with this patch
please let me know...I'm hoping it can be included in 2.2.x.
