hi:
I use a PIII machine as the server and cyrixIII machine as the client.The
kernel is 2.4.5.The distribute is red hat 7.1
when i mount the nfs file system at the client it failed.The core file is
created.using the gdb it report  :
Program terminated with signal 4(SIGILL),Illegal instruction
#0  0x40003e28 in ??()
If i change the cpu (CyrixIII) to PIII all is ok.
