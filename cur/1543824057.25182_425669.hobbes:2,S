Rather amusing, given that Dennis Ritchie has a different memory of it:
http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/hist.html
He seems to think that one of the original motivating forces for Unix
was to provide a development environment for a PDP-7, so that they
could support the graphics terminal for a game called 'Space Travel'.
So if anything, Unix was designed specifically *for* graphics.
Now who should I believe here, dmr or an apparent troll?
