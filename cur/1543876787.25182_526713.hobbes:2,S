Brilliant.  You people really know how to create user interfaces.  So
now in any case per CPU another stat/access syscall is needed to check
the 'online' pseudo-file?  With this the readdir solution is only
marginally faster than parsing /proc/cpuinfo which means, it's
unacceptably slow.
I cannot believe all these big system people are allowed to screw
everybody else up with their nonsense.
So, anybody else has a proposal?  This is a pressing issue and cannot
wait until someday in the distant future NUMA topology information is
easily and speedily accessible.
