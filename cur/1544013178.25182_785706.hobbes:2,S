I know this has gone in, but isn't this naked 'if' unsafe.  Consider the
following hypothetical code:
  if (safe)
    for_each_irq_desc(irq, desc) {
       ...
    }
  else
    panic();
With the macro definition above, the loop would panic() each time !desc,
and _not_ panic() when !safe.  I'd consider this behaviour to be
unexpected, to say the least :-)
The fix is to change the
  if (desc)
in the macro to
  if (!desc) ; else
