Al, be reasonable.  There are many out-of-tree GPL modules that won't be 
accepted into mainline, never mind those that shouldn't be accepted.  But 
these modules do have a right to not be obsoleted by constant API changes.
You are effectively inhibiting the development of an out-of-tree GPL module 
pool, by constantly pulling the rug under that community.
Do you think this is fair?
Thanks!
