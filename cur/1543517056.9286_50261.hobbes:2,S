...and you're absolutely right on this.
"count" is has only two occurences in get_empty_dquot():
        /*
         * Try pruning the dcache to free up some dquots ...
         */
        printk(KERN_DEBUG "get_empty_dquot: pruning %d\n", count);
        if (prune_dcache(0, 128))
        {
                free_inode_memory(count);
                goto repeat;
        }
Taking a look at free_inode_memory():
void free_inode_memory(int goal)
{
        spin_lock(&inode_lock);
        free_inodes();
        spin_unlock(&inode_lock);
}
Obviously "count" and "goal" are never used and completely obsolete -
technically. But I think there was a reason for this. As I'm quite new to
the kernel source I don't know wether free_inodes() ever took a goal parameter
or if this is planned for the future.
So the question is: eliminate "count" and "goal" completely?

Exactly this is the case. Shame on me.
Thanx!
