Well it would appear the tulip driver regressed from 2.4.2-ac22 and
2.4.3. (2.4.3-ac12 isn't working either) Once again, my tulip card just
spews carrier errors and doesn't even get a link light.
If someone could point me to a patch I would appreciate it. I have
attached any pretient information below.
Thanks, Ian Zink
