kernel 2.4.2-ac3, gcc-2.95.2, libc-2.1.3, SuSE-7.0 base system.
Using ReiserFS 3.5.x disk format, binutils-2.10, x86(P3/866)-SMP system.
The program from Erik did the following:
Creating 8192 files ... done
Appending to the files ... done
Checking files for null bytes ...
  reiser-00000.test contains null bytes
  reiser-00001.test contains null bytes
  reiser-00002.test contains null bytes
  reiser-00003.test contains null bytes
  reiser-00004.test contains null bytes
<snip a lot of lines>
  reiser-08189.test contains null bytes
  reiser-08190.test contains null bytes
  reiser-08191.test contains null bytes
Checking done
Good luck,
Jurriaan
