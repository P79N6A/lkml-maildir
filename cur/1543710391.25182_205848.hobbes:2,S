Hmm... I guess it is still smooth because it is swapping out only
inactive pages. If the standard VM isn't being pushed very hard it
doesn't scan mapped pages at all which is why it isn't swapping.
I have a preference for allowing it to scan some mapped pages though.
I'm not sure if there is any attempt at a drop behind logic. That
might help. Add new unmapped pagecache pages to the inactive list or
something might help... hmm, actually that's what it does now by the
looks.
I guess you don't have a problem though.
