I think this is a big problem, a minute is much too long. I guess its
taking this long to build up because X needs a great deal of inertia
so that it can stay in a highly interactive state right?
If so then it seems the interactivity estimator does not have enough
information to work properly for X. In which case maybe X needs to be
reniced, or backboosted, or have _something_ done to help out.
