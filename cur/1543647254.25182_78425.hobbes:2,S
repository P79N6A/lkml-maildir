Subject: Re: [BUG] apm resume hangs on IBM T22 with 2.4.19 (harddrive sleeps forever)

I have more information for bugreport below.
I've tested some kernel versions today and results are (BUG means hd
sleeps forever on this kernel, OK means hd finally wake up)
2.4.18      - OK (I'm using this now)
2.4.19pre1  - OK
2.4.19pre2  - OK
2.4.19pre3  - doesn't boot for me.^
2.4.19pre4  - BUG
2.4.19pre5  - BUG
2.4.19      - BUG
2.4.20pre10 - BUG
^ 2.4.19pre3 doesn't boot for me. The last messages from kernel during
boor are:
CPU: L1 I cache: 16k, L1 D cache: 16k
CPU: L2 cache: 256k
Intel machine check architecture supported.
^ here kernel hangs forever
With this boot problem, I'm not able to exactly detect which pre is broken
and brings the BUG first.
Is there anything which I should try to better debug this problem?
Note that copying arch/i386/kernel/apm.c file from 2.4.18 into 2.4.19pre4
and 2.4.19 doesn't help too, so maybe problem is somewhere else...
Note2: nearly after each (as I think) resume there is following text in
syslog:
Oct  9 10:20:24 thinkpad apmd[205]: User Suspend
Oct  9 10:20:47 thinkpad apmd[205]: apmd_call_proxy: Executing proxy: '/etc/apm/apmd_proxy' 'resume' 'suspend'
Oct  9 10:21:04 thinkpad kernel: ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_lostirq func only: 13
Oct  9 10:21:04 thinkpad kernel: hda: lost interrupt
Oct  9 10:21:07 thinkpad apmd[205]: apmd_call_proxy: +  Setting the System Clock using the Hardware Clock as reference... System Clock set. Local time: Wed Oct  9 10:21:07 CEST 2002
Oct  9 10:21:07 thinkpad apmd[205]: Normal Resume
Thanks,
Karel
