I have a question that I was going to ask before on this list, but never got
around to it.
I am working on a version of gpm to support mice with the now infamous
"wheel"
(or wheels).  I am looking for a way for a userlevel program (gpm) to
progammatically scroll-(back/forward) the current virtual console.  Any help
would be appreciated...
Thanks,
Loren
