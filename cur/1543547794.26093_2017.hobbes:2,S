We are trying to use a Dell poweredge 1300 with a dds4 tape drive 
When we try reading from a tape, the reading process gets stuck in D state
after the last data has been read. According to ps l, the process is stuck
in down_failed. Turning hardware compression on and off, or switching to a
DDS2 tape does not solve the problem.
This is the tape drive (AKA Dell PowerVault 100T DDS4 Drive)
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 06 Lun:
00
  Vendor: ARCHIVE  Model: Python 06408-XXX Rev: 8071
  Type:   Sequential-Access                ANSI SCSI revision: 03
The SCSI card is an adaptec :
           SCSI Adapter: Adaptec AHA-294X Ultra2 SCSI host adapter
                           Ultra-2 LVD/SE Wide Controller at PCI 0/13/0
The system is running stock RedHat 6.2 
2.2.14-6.1.1smp (the problem also occurs with an up kernel, we still have
to switch the default boot).
Is there anything we can try ?
Thanks in advance,
Frank Gevaerts
