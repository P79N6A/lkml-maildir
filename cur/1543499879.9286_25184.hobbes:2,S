Subject: 2.3.7 OOPS and stuff that don't compile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I know 2.3.7 is supposed to be dangerous, but it looks like it is
broken too.  I compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3
linux/fs/minix/file.c linux/fs/fat/file.c and ntfs don't compile.
The PIIX IDE driver doesn't compile either.
Error messages for these are at the bottom of this mail.
Leaving out those filesystems and using generic pci ide gave me a
working kernel used for posting this.
It oopses on swapon though.  I realize this isn't the best
oops report possible, but I had to write it down on paper
as there was no logfiles.  And ksymoops wouldn't compile,
the file bfd.h is missing?
2.3.7 oopsed 3 times before hanging when executing swapon -a during
boot.
Using /proc/ksymoops the first oops was in __get_free_pages
It looked like this:
Activating swap...

Please tell if there is anything more I could do to
investigate this.  Reproducing it should be easy enough,
by running swapon.
