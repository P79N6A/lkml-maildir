Um, changes to the kernel do _not_ affect user-kernel API.  Well, they
shouldn't anyway.  They just add more features, which newer user-space
can use if it knows about them.  So what is your reason for having to
release a new Glibc every week?

The subject of this thread is RLIM_INFINITY.  There's an example that
wouldn't be a problem at all if you didn't include kernel headers.

Something for a separate thread...

Why is hardcoding a kernel-user API, which is set in stone by binary
compatibility requirements anyway, out of the question?  They can be
hard coded in the distributed source, so that clueless users don't need
to know anything.
Hmm... well that doesn't really explain why pppd comes with copies of
the kernel headers but will use ones from the installed kernel if
they're newer...  Why is that?

Using a new kernel is easy.  Compile, install, reboot.  Provided the
Glibc headers don't point to the new kernel's headers it works fine :-)
