[class_]device_destroy()? Yeah, but it's exactly same thing as
[class_]device_unregister.
But this is really good question. Should I manually clean up attributes,
or sysfs will take care? I.e. whole battery directory removes, and
sysfs removes files in it, or they just leaks?
I've took worst scenario, and done removal manually (I've grep'ed in
drivers/, and almost every driver also doing so).
