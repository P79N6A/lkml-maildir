Hi,
accessfs is a new file system to control access to system resources.
Currently it controls access to inet_bind() with ports < 1024 and raw
sockets only.
With this patch, there's no need anymore to run internet daemons as
root. You can individually configure which user/program can bind to
ports below 1024.
Changes:
- diff against linux 2.5.3
The patch is available at:

Regards, Olaf.
