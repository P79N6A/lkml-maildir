Subject: [PATCH] convert aty128fb to new framebuffer API
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I have converted aty128fb.c in current 2.5 to the new framebuffer API,
imported various fixes from the 2.4 PPC tree (fixes for running at
15bpp and 16bpp, plus support for sleeping (suspending) on
powerbooks), and reindented it to 8-column tabs.  Since the patch is
rather large, I didn't include it here.  It is available at
ftp://ftp.samba.org/pub/paulus/aty128.patch
 instead.
Paul.
