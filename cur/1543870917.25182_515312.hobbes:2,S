Well, even this far into 2.6, Linus' patch from 2003 still (mostly)  
applies; the maintenance cost for this kind of code is virtually  
zilch.  If it matters that much to you clean it up and make it apply;  
add an alarmfd() syscall (another 100 lines of code at most?) and  
make a "read" return an architecture-independent siginfo-like  
structure and submit it for inclusion.  Adding epoll() support for  
random objects is as simple as a 75-line object-filesystem and a 25- 
line syscall to return an FD to a new inode.  Have fun!  Go wild!   
Something this trivially simple could probably spend a week in -mm  
and go to linus for 2.6.22.
Cheers,
