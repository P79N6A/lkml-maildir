Hi again.
In 2.3.1, ethertap.c still has the __skb_push problem (not defined,
but skb_push is ok -- should I be using this?), and there's an
additional difficulty with joystick.c:
joystick.c: In function `js_sync_buff':
joystick.c:445: warning: passing arg 1 of `__wake_up' from incompatible pointer type
joystick.c: In function `js_read':
joystick.c:494: variable `wait' has initializer but incomplete type
joystick.c:494: warning: excess elements in struct initializer after `wait'
joystick.c:494: warning: excess elements in struct initializer after `wait'
joystick.c:494: storage size of `wait' isn't known
joystick.c:528: warning: passing arg 1 of `add_wait_queue' from incompatible pointer type
joystick.c:549: warning: passing arg 1 of `remove_wait_queue' from incompatible pointer type
joystick.c:494: warning: unused variable `wait'
joystick.c: In function `js_poll':
joystick.c:671: warning: passing arg 2 of `poll_wait' from incompatible pointer type
Kernel 2.2.7 has been really stable on this single-processor P233MMX
with latest cvs isdn snapshots, compiled with pgcc-1.1.3
(egcs-1.1.2).
Uptime: 13 days, lots of heavy compiling and Real Audio serving
Meanwhile, 2.0.34 and 2.2.2 have clocked up over 40 days continuous
uptime since the last power-cut here on a couple of "set and forget"
machines doing news and backups.
