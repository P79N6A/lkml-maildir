The default must be that APIC errors are logged. They are valid
indicators of hardware brokenness, and have in the past been
traced to bad mobos, bad PSUs, bad cooling, and even kernel bugs.
The fact that many systems manage to limp along in their presence
doesn't matter.
The default for apic_printk is to print nothing (apic_verbosity
== APIC_QUIET). You could add a fourth level (ERROR or WARNING)
between QUIET and VERBOSE, make apic_verbosity initialise to that
level, and use that level for the APIC error messages. That would
make the messages visible by default but possible to suppress for
knowledgeable users.
