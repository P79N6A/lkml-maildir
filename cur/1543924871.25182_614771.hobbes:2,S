Hi Petar,
I saw similar bug report for dm-crypt over loop but reproducible even
on stand-alone loop devices -  see 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8020
The problem was caused by loop io stalling in balance_dirty_pages.
Per BDI dirty limit patchset (included in 2.6.24-rc) fixed it.
Anyway, you should attach output of process states when system stops
responding (output of "echo t >/proc/sysrq-trigger" ) here to allow
some analysis.
Milan
