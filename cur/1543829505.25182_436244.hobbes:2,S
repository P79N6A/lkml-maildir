The BIOS docs are fairly confusing on that point referring to one bit as
the "PIO FIFO" bit.

Set the controller to support PIO only and see what happens. 
[ie set .udma_mask = 0 i nthe ali_init_one entries]
If that works it implies the DMA tuning may be involved. If that doesn't
change it what happens with a hard disk in the same place ?
