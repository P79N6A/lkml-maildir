Subject: [PATCH] remove VM_DONTCOPY bogosities
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Now that it's madvisable, remove two pieces of VM_DONTCOPY bogosity:
1. There was and is no logical reason why VM_DONTCOPY should be in the
   list of flags which forbid vma merging (and those drivers which set
   it are also setting VM_IO, which itself forbids the merge).
2. It's hard to understand the purpose of the VM_HUGETLB, VM_DONTCOPY
   block in vm_stat_account: but never mind, it's under CONFIG_HUGETLB,
   which (unlike CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE or CONFIG_HUGETLBFS) has never been
   defined.

Looks like wli is offline at present: I had been hoping to hear from him
before removing that block from vm_stat_account; but now that it turns
out never to have done anything anyway, let's go ahead and remove it.
