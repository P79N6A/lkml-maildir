I would do immediatly if I would know how. I have installed bitkeeper
and I tried to do: bk pull bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5 but it just
gives me an error. I searched a bit, but I couldn't finde some helpful
help for how to checkout the tree from bk and at the moment I don't have
enough time to do so ...
would be a good thing to explain this in more detail on kernel.org eg
... perhaps directly on the main page ...
