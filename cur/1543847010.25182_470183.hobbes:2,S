Gaah. It has those ugly "cherry-picked from" messages (please use "-r" 
when cherry-picking, or "-e" and edit them out), but it looks fine 
otherwise, and I think I heard a _very_ convincing "please do it" from 
everybody involved when this was discussed, so I've pulled. 
Any fall-out from this should be both obvious and pretty trivial to fix 
up.
