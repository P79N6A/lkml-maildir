Probably a head crash, this was a 5 month old 15krpm 73GB scsi disk.

I'd consider disks that take 10 minutes or more to become ready
extremely obsolete :-)

Not really, wait your 10 minutes, echo "scsi remove-single-device a b c

For all intents and purposes, the media isn't there...
Do you really think that the current behaviour (wait until eternity for
the drive to become ready on read capacity) to be the correct behaviour?
If so, why bother with the delay (of max. 100s) until spinup? Simply
issue the spinup command, and start trying to read the capacity would be
enough then.
