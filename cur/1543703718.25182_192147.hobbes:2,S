|      claims that by using the loop interface, it should be possible to
|      use EFS CDs with SCSI drives, too.
| 
|      I have tried this as follows:
| 
|      losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/scd0
|      mount -r -t efs /dev/loop0 /cdrom
|      cd /cdrom
|      tar cf - . | tar xv -C/somewhere/else -f-
| 
|      It reads a few files, then panics on a large file.  If I am running
|      X11, the only symptom I see is that the machine freezes totally and
|      the Caps Lock and Scroll Lock lights on the keyboard start blinking.
|      If I'm in the text console, it displays the message:
| 
| Kernel panic: scsi_free:Trying to free unused memory
Are there some other messages associated with this, like
a BUG or stack dump?  Those could be helpful.
