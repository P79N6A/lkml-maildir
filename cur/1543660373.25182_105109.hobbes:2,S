Hi,
 in drivers/ide some files where moved into subdirectories, but in the
pointers to the files in Configure.help are to the old positions. Also
some of the files in the subdirs where containing the old path in the 
comments.
Also fixed is the renaming of CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX to 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC203XX_OLD. 
The patches are found unter:
