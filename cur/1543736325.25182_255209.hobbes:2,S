Yeah, this never bugged me much but some people hate this behavior.  I
set it to 0, works fine.
My point is that people will abuse mlock(1).  Maybe that is not our
concern.  But, the current users of mlock have to know what they are
doing to some extent.  Like the ntpd example, it doesn't mlock ALL it's
memory, just the portion that can't be swapped out due to realtime
constraints.
