No, this won't cause trouble with the optimizer, because the
optimizer isn't supposed to do _wrong_ things.
The optimizer will not remove two !! in a row, simply because that
_isn't_ a valid optimization as you just have seen.  
"!" is a logical not, it isn't a bitwise not.  The result of
!!(something)
is different from just (something) whenever (something) is
neither 0 or 1, the optimizer knows that very well.
Use gcc -S to get readable assembly.
Try these yourself, they compile to different code:
int main(int argc){return argc;}
int main(int argc){return !!argc;}
They have to be different, as argc >= 2 gives different results.
And try:
int main(int argc){return !argc;}
int main(int argc){return !!!argc;}
These gives the same code with or without optimization with
gcc 2.95.4 on i386, as they are equivalent.  The first ! normalize
to 1 or 0, the two others are then removeable.
