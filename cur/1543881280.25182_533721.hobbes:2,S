No.  The PG_lru flag bit is just one bit amongst many others:
what of concurrent operations changing other bits in that same
unsigned long e.g. trying to lock the page by setting PG_locked?
There are some places where such micro-optimizations can be made
(typically while first allocating the page); but in general, no.
