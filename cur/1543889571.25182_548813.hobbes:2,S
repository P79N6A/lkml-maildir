i very much agree that this kmalloc_index() one shouldnt be called a 
"BUG: ", but if you look at the majority of WARN_ON() instances they are 
checks for clear, serious kernel bugs. Very often we use WARN_ON() not 
to signal that it's just a harmless warning, but because we do not want 
to bring the system down via a BUG_ON(). The API is misnamed for sure, 
but still, the purpose and current practice is clear: to signal kernel 
bugs.
To quantify this a bit more objectively i just did a "grep WARN_ON 
kernel/*.c" and randomly picked 10 out of the 113 WARN_ON()'s:
 kernel/cpu.c:			WARN_ON(1);
 kernel/exit.c:	WARN_ON(atomic_read(&tsk->fs_excl));
 kernel/fork.c:	WARN_ON(!(tsk->exit_state & (EXIT_DEAD | EXIT_ZOMBIE)));
 kernel/futex.c:	WARN_ON(!pi_state);
 kernel/hrtimer.c:		WARN_ON_ONCE(timer->cb_mode ==  HRTIMER_CB_IRQSAFE_NO_SOFTIRQ);
 kernel/lockdep.c:		WARN_ON(1);
 kernel/mutex-debug.c:	DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(list_empty(&waiter->list));
 kernel/rtmutex.c:	WARN_ON(rt_mutex_is_locked(lock));
 kernel/sched.c:	if (DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON((preempt_count() < 0)))
 kernel/softirq.c:       WARN_ON_ONCE(in_irq());
and reviewed each instance, each and every one of these warnings is a 
serious kernel bug that i would not 'warn' about, but what i'd like to 
see reported ASAP. [ In fact i added 5 of these WARN_ON()s :-/ ] But 
maybe that's just me?
now regarding the naming of this API, i'd very much agree to do this 
rename:
   WARN_ON  =>  BUG_ON
   BUG_ON   =>  CRASH_ON
and make WARN_ON() print a "WARNING: ".
and i signalled this in the original discussion too a few months ago 
when i opposed the watering-down of the WARN_ON printk.
OTOH i dont feel that strongly about all this :-)
