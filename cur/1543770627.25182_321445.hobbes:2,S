Fantastic!  I have done some slight edits over what are probably typos.

I don't see why very careful nesting wouldn't work.  Because you could
get the count up on a locked-out lock?  The problems of VMS
asynchronous traps :)
the outer ones would have higher hold times than the inner ones.

we could subtract the average lock-held time from the time that
the current lock has been held to find an expected time until
the lock becomes free, so we only try spinning when the current
holder of the lock is nearly done.  Hmm what other metrics would
be easy to gather?

      if(contention)atomic_dec(&sph->queued);
when there was no contention we didn't increment.

These don't need to be atomic functions, since we haven't released
the lock yet, or is there a risk that nonatomic gets and sets will get
deferred? no I'm sorry atomic_[get|set] pertains to operations on
atomic_t data is that correct?

is there a schedule-that-function-next call?  The spinaphore idea is that
instead of simply yielding until later (cond_resched) we register ourselves
with the sph object, with a linked list, an actual queue instead of a count
of queued threads -- and at unlocking time, if there's a queue, the head of
the line gets the service next.  Which would scale to a lot of CPUs, still with
a spinlock around the setting of the head-of-line pointer.
I guess I need to look at Ingo's mutexes before wasting more of everyone's time
