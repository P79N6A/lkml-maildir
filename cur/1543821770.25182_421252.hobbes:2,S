Good point.
I suppose this means that the limits.h header file is used, either
directly or indirectly, by both us (the kernel) and by user-space? If
so, blech! What's the policy on keeping around config values that don't
do anything inside the kernel anymore? The short list is:
 NR_OPEN
 ARG_MAX
 CHILD_MAX
 OPEN_MAX
 LINK_MAX
 MAX_CANON
 MAX_INPUT
 RTSIG_MAX
