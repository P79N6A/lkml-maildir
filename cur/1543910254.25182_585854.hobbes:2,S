That's just an example of a general problem.
No, you don't use "x.counter++". But you *do* use
	if (atomic_read(&x) <= 1)
and loading into a register is stupid and pointless, when you could just 
do it as a regular memory-operand to the cmp instruction.
And as far as the compiler is concerned, the problem is the 100% same: 
combining operations with the volatile memop.
The fact is, a compiler that thinks that
	movl mem,reg
	cmpl $val,reg
is any better than
	cmpl $val,mem
is just not a very good compiler. But when talking about "volatile", 
that's exactly what ytou always get (and always have gotten - this is 
not a regression, and I doubt gcc is alone in this).
