No, Debian.
The reason I said it was something to do with my motherboard is that
I've not experienced this before, even on another motherboard with
the original nForce.
Traditionally (as in Windows), the only thing that would keep the CD
from being ejected is an ongoing recording session. Of course, in
Linux, it just has to be mounted, and that's normal behavior. Just that
the drive doesn't want to eject my CD even after unmounting it.
Does that mean that this is a userspace problem?
