The latest output of memburn after a bit of format hacking:
FAILED at round 78/165714207: got 0000ff00, expected 00000000!!!
REREAD: 0000ff00, 0000ff00, 0000ff00!!!
and
FAILED at round 160/200780831: got 02025302, expected 02020202!!!
REREAD: 02025302, 02025302, 02025302!!!
So it appears that its the third byte of 4 each time thats fubar'd.  
I'l run it a few more times to confirm.  Is memory byte wide per chip 
on these things today?

Looks like I'll have to, the newer one is about 600 bytes bigger 
already, so there are lots of changes.
OTOH, I'm now up 21 hours, and the memory management so far is 
surviving on 2.6.8.1-mm2.  memburn may be hitting the errors, keeping 
them from taking down the os maybe?  Sillier things have happened.
