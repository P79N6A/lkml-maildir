That implies moving
        struct thread_info      *owner;
out from under the CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES code.  One of the original
justifications for mutexes was:
 - 'struct mutex' is smaller on most architectures: .e.g on x86,
   'struct semaphore' is 20 bytes, 'struct mutex' is 16 bytes.
    A smaller structure size means less RAM footprint, and better
    CPU-cache utilization.
I'd be reluctant to reverse that decision just for btrfs.
Benchmarking required!  Maybe I can put a patch together that implements
the simple 'spin if it's running' heuristic and throw it at our
testing guys on Monday ...
