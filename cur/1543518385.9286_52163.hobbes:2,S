Because you'd rather improve the internals of your driver than spend all
your time tracking kernel changes?  Whenever this argument breaks out, I
read between the lines a plea to exchange the steady rain of changes for a
kind of punctuated evolution.
"I want a defined, stable driver API" != "I want the driver interface cast
in stone forever".  You gather up ideas that require incompatible changes,
and from time to time release a new API version and indicate that "all
block API 1.2 code will be removed in the next stable release" or
something like that.  That announcement is the wakeup call for driver
maintainers everywhere to concentrate on the interface for awhile, and the
new API document tells them where they should be looking for problems in
their code.  It should make planning easier, no?
I do *not* want to engage in a firefight over this issue; I just wanted to
bring out a point that I don't recall seeing made explicit.

Please, no more software products offering a "richer experience"!  I have
indigestion of the brain already.  Give me a more ascetic experience.
