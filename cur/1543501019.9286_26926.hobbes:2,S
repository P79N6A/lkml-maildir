This is a hard to detect problem.
Your CDR might have a hard time reading your files. I don't know 
the access patterns of rpm, but they might be different from cp.
Maybe your SCSI bus is too long and arbitration does not work as designed,
so you get conflicts. Maybe the termination is bad. In both cases you
should find some errors in yout syslog. (You did not disable Parity, I hope!)
Which SCSI driver do you use? You should use ncr53c8xx ...
