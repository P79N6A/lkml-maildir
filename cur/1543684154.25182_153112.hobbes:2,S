There is no such instruction. Skip LOCK prefix and decode again,
you'll get either cmpxchg or xadd (or cmpxchg8b, but then it does
not work on i486 too).
And yes, it speeds some workloads a lot. Best to look at code,
with these instructions you can do couple of operations without
doing IPC to synchronize with other threads.
And as far as I know, userspace solution does not qualify: major user
is synchronization between threads, so with userspace solution you
will have to do very hard job to get it right (first implement your
own synchronization, if possible without busy waiting... and then
implement cmpxchg on the top of it), while kernel solution can do 
that simple & correct for UP case.
