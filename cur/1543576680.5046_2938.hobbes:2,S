This option, according to .../Documentation/networking/alias.txt, seems
to be missing in 2.4.0-test13-pre4?  Could whoever maintains this please
update either the code or the documentation?

"Faith may be defined briefly as an illogical belief in the occurrence of the
 improbable...A man full of faith is simply one who has lost (or never had)
 the capacity for clear and realistic thought. He is not a mere ass: he is
 actually ill."
