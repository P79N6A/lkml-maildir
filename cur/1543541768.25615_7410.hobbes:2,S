I can see three reasons easily:
First, namespace issues.  What if the filesystem is your root
directory?  How do you get at the streamset for it?  (This is
relatively minor.)
Second, performance.  Any time you want to see if a file is on such a
partition, you have to look at every directory from / down to the file
itself, and see if any of those are one half of a twin mount, before
you can decide.  This gets even knottier if you have to handle
symlinks.
Third, principle of least surprise.  If you move a file in one spot,
do the corresponding elements in the other fs also move?  Do you have
any security issues related to race conditions because the two
filesystems are tied together?
Having parallel directory structures is an awkward solution at best.
Having them fork at the mount point combines some of the worst
features of the various proposals that have been floated.
