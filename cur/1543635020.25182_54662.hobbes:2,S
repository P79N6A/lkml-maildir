These mean nothing to me -- what are they, the base line or the changed
kernel? Or none of the above?!

You need to add some context to that statement.

So you are saying that writes don't need to be reordered as much,
because the drive typically does that? I guess that will always be true
with write back caching, I doubt that holds for write through.
And I don't quite follow the number of passes you compare, passes of
what? Insert and merge are a single pass per request, tops.
