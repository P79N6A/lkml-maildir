Yes, from the last discussions. But you cannot deny that Debian initially
considered moving cdrecord to non-free, which was the point of the post you
replied to.

You explain that SuSE is non-cooperative, because they distribute crippled
cdrecord, but you fail to explain what crippledness do you have in mind.
Also, if you put away your flamethrower and just politely asked SUSE to add
a message like `this version has been modified by SUSE, so please send your
bug reports to support@suse.com instead of the original author', the whole
issue would be probably already settled a long time ago.
				Have a nice fortnight
