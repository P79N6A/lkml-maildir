Features are removed when they are no longer features, but design
irritations in a new and improved design, and usually, equivalent or
better (or at least thought to be) functionality is available still in
the big picture (which includes user-space), hopefully in a cleaner
place.
Now, design is often a holy war, and people disagree. That's fine and to
be expected. And sometimes, the whole solution takes a while to
materialize and be implemented from the kernel up to all user-space and
even longer until it has been implemented in the brains of the admins.
This, too, is fine and expected. It's called "innovation" and
"development", sometimes iterative.

You're assuming the kernel is both "static" design-wise as well as
independent (or at least basically eternally backwards compatible) from
user-space. Both assumptions are no longer true. Get over it.
