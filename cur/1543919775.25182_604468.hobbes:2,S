Through the magic of greylisting (thanks vger) and IRC, I've just had a
chat with Arjan and GregKH about this stuff.  So, just to follow up for
people interested in watching me talk to myself:
- while an LSM must be compiled in, they are not mutually exclusive,
  and the desired module can be selected at boot-time.
As such, I don't have any strong objections.  It'd be nice for folks
doing LSM development to allow for a way for it to be modular, but I'll let
them fight for that.  :)
Sorry for the noise,
