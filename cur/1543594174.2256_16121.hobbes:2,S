I've done some experiments with a _clean_ shortage.  Requiring that a
portion of inactive pages be pre cleaned improves response as you start
reclaiming.  Even though you may have enough inactive pages total, you
know that laundering is needed before things get heavy.  This gets the
dirty pages moving a little sooner.  As you're reclaiming pages, writes
trickle out whether your dirty list is short or long.  (and if I'd been
able to make that idea work a little better, you'd have seen my mess;)
