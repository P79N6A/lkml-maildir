Hi,
I compile and run linux-2.6.0-test5-mm4. It works wonderful, but when I
switch to X windows it's OK. But, when I tried to exit X, it completely
freezes the box. I tried this with open source nvidia (nv) driver and
proprietary nvidia (nvidia)driver. Results are always same. My hardware is:
P-II 350, 384 RAM, BX board and Riva TNT gfx card. The same thing also
happened with vanilla linux-2.6.0-test5. I attached my .config and
version_linux outputs. Any idea ?
Regards,
Tarkan Erimer
