This patch works for me too.

Perhaps the kernel should use ERESTARTNOHAND instead of EINTR?
The current code is more than odd:
- select() and sys_ppoll() both use ERESTARTNOHAND (i.e.: 
the functions do not return to user space with SIGSTOP/SIGCONT or
freezer())
- sys_poll() uses EINTR (i.e.: SIGSTOP/SIGCONT/freezer() return to user
space)
Attached is a patch that switches sys_poll to ERESTARTNOHAND and a poll
test app.
Boot tested with FC6.
What do you think? With ERESTARTNOHAND, poll would only return to user
space if the app has a SIGCONT handler installed.
