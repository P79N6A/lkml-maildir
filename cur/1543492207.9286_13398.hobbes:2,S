Don't do it, then :-).
No, bad argument. Ok, so you want executable that does not work with
old kernel. But that is easy! Invent incompatible extension to
elf. And now, watch:
2.0.x kernel sees suid executable with broken header. It refuses to
load it.
6.7.x kernel sees suid executable with new header and capabilities
header. It loads it, sees header, and runs it with right capabilities.
I hear you asking: why do you want new header, when 
set_capabilities(...) near enough in main() is good enough?
That's easy. I want lscap command to be able to tell me what
capabilities command uses.

PS: And now, questions: Does anyone see a possibility how to add
suitable information into _existing_ elf executable?
I'd like to be able
#setcap /bin/ping CAP_RAWSOCK
without need to recompile ping. It is not essential feature. Still it
would be nice.
