I like the Sam proposal, but maybe we can simplify the rules on
"module" segment: some informations are often redundant, dependencies
are sometime calculated by config part and sometime by Makefile
(and sometime in the Makefile there are some wrong hacks).
I would really like a good section like:
module
    foo : file1.o file2.o
and let the complex rules in the normal Makefile
(which is also good because the complex rules are often not
specific to a single driver).
But I don't like merging all info in a single file:
- not so clean in case of multiple source-file driver
- it would be more complex the "copy and paste"
   from other drivers: most developers are not
   comfortable with Kconfig and Makefile, so easy to grep
   others Kconfig/Makefile could help developers not do
   do strange/wrong hacks.
