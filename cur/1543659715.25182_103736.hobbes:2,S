Hi there,
when compiling 2.5.58, I get hosts of
"drivers/video/sis/sis_main.c:XX:YY: video/fbcon[*].h: no such file or 
dir" !
Investigatig a bit, I found that several FB headers are missing in
"include/video/" since 2.5.48 (the last one I have that has those 
missing files):
fbcon.h, fbcon-cfb8.h, fbcon-cfb16.h, fbcon-cfb24.h, fbcon-cfb32.h, 
fbcon-accel.h, ...
I've of course [re-re-re-re]checked with different archives and 
different versions...
Am I in the 4th dimension, or have I missed something ?
Arnaud
