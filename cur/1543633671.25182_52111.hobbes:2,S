Absolutely....  I haven't mentioned this to Alan specifically, but it is 
indeed a direction I would like to go.  A good step would be getting 
your help to make sure that starfire works with kcompat24 (perhaps with 
minor patching)  :)  If we have tested patches ready for 2.2 that will 
go a long way towards winning Alan's acceptance, I'm sure.
Another idea I just had:  a good way to introduce kcompat24 to 2.2 is to 
use it to add a few 2.4.x-only net drivers to 2.2.  That way nothing 
changes [initially], only additions are made.
