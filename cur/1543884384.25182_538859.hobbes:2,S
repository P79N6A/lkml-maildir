I said above that I thought SLUB ought to be defaulted to on throughout
the -rcs: if we don't do that, we're not going to learn much from having
it in Linus' tree.
And perhaps that line which appends "PREEMPT " to an oops report ought
to append "SLUB " too, for so long as there's a choice.

You're forgetting your unions in struct page: in the SPLIT_PTLOCK
case (NR_CPUS >= 4) the pagetable code is using spinlock_t ptl,
which overlays SLUB's first_page and slab pointers.
I just tried rebuilding powerpc with the SPLIT_PTLOCK cutover
edited to 8 cpus instead, and then no crash.
I presume the answer is just to extend your quicklist work to
powerpc's lowest level of pagetables.  The only other architecture
which is using kmem_cache for them is arm26, which has
"#error SMP is not supported", so won't be giving this problem.
