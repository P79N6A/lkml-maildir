I'd like to see a linux based PnP program, that allows you to see _all_
PnP devices in the system.  No, isapnp doesn't do this.  It only allows
you configure ISA PnP devices - and won't even show the system board PnP
devices.  Why do we want this information? Fast IrDA devices are
typically built into the system board, and I want to be able to query
and find out what devices are there.  If your PnP system returns
"generic IrDA device", well, it's broken.  (that's usually an alias for
the SIR portion.)
Personally, I want this to be userland.  We can configure the device
when we load the module (or hard code the configuration into the
kernel).
If someone knows of program that can do this, please email me with
information.  So far, all of the Linux PnP systems don't get this right.
