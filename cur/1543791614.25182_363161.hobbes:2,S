Looks like you actually ended up with a 1.2TB partition formatted
as XFS on a 3.5TB device...

Why?  Just use /dev/sdc directly, and you'll avoid the 32 bit
problems fdisk (or the default partition table type, I can't
remember which it is now) evidently has.

mkfs.xfs is just using the information that its given from the
kernel, which is the second /proc/partitions line above.

Try without the partition, looks like that'll work.
