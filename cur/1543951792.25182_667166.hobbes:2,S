Looks correct to me, thus ACK.
Spinning that a little further I wonder how useful the rest of the
Alchemy code - which seems to only deal with devices - is.  If at all.
I'm going to check with some Alchemy users if that code actually works or
can be removed.  I think the latter.  Also there is the APM emulation
available which provides similar functionality.
