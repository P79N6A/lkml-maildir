All my development machines for the MCA-sepcific parts of the kernel are
386's or 486's (quite naturally; the Pentium models are very hard to get
a hold of. I really wish I could, however.)

I do my word-processing using my Mac IIsi (with a grayscale portray
display), because my favourite word-processor, barring LaTeX, of course,
is MacWrite II.
