Doug Ledford sent me the latest PIII patches.  I'll send them to you in
a subsequent email, but I haven't tried them yet.  I am currently
running patch fx-2.2.5-A4 that Kurt Garloff sent me, and that is running
fine.  You will need to specify PIII at configure time.
To actually assemble the new MMX2/KNI/SSE/XMM (insert your favorite name
here) instructions you will need binutils-2.9.1.0.23+.  I am using
2.9.1.0.25.
The new PIII instructions are rather fast for float vector operations.
