Hi, 
Can any one kindly explain why automatic memory size detection works on 
some motherboards, and refuses to do so on some others?
I've a Gigabyte 5AA, with AMD-K6/2-366MHz, with 128M ram, and I've change
the /etc/lilo.conf when I add or remove ram from the system.
Thanks in advance, 
--masu
P.S: I am on the list, so: do not CC me please! :^)
