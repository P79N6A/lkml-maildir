How do you know that it gets into this at RAMx2? Have you added 'bi' from
vmstat?
One interesting thing to notice from vmstat is...
r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us  sy id
When performing nicely:
0 200  1   1676   3200   3012 786004   0 292 42034   298  791   745   4  29 67
0 200  1   1676   3308   3136 785760   0   0 44304     0  748   758   3  15 82

Later when being slow:
0 200  0  3468   3316  4060 784668  0   0  1018    0  613   631   1   2 97
0 200  0  3468   3292  4060 784688  0   0  1034    0  617   638   0   3 97
0 200  0  3468   3200  4068 784772  0   0  1066    6  694   727   2   4 94
No swap activity (si + so == 0), mostly idle (id > 90).
So it is waiting - on what??? timer? disk?

Roy, did you notice the mail from Andrew Morton:

rmap11c changed the queue_nr_requests, that problem went away.
But another one showed its ugly head...
Could you please try this part of rmap11c only? Or the very simple one 
setting queue_nr_request to = 2048 for a test drive...
