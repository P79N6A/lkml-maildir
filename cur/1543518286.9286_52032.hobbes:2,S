This just destroyed all registers, so the syscall stub would need to save
them redundantly (entry.S does it anyways). With multiple magic addresses
per syscall-with-N-arguments it gets more ugly. 
The obvious micro optimization of reversing the order of the register loads
and using magic_address+(6-NARGS)*4 would probably not scale too well to
IA64 magic.
Also it costs you one TLB entry.
