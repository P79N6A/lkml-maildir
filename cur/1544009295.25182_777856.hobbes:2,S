Even as far as hibernation is concerned, I wouldn't _expect_ any BIOS to do
anything like this as long as we use the ACPI facility to enter S4.

While I'd really like to do that, I also think that we should make all drivers
behave in the same way in this area.
Also, we need to state clearly what the _recommended_way of doing that is,
at least as a guidance for driver writers if not for anything else.
So, can we just say that PCI drivers shouldn't free IRQs during suspend and
request them during resume, and if there's any problem that leads to, then it
should be solved differently?
