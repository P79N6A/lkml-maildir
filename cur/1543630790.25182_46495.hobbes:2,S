Unfortunately the patch fixes only the case when NTFS is compiled into the
kernel. There are missing exports of kmap_pte and kmap_prot when you use
ntfs as the kernel module and depmod fails then.
The following patch adresses this issue. Could anyone please test it with
a highmem box? The patch will be included in the next release (2.0.7d or
2.0.8a).
