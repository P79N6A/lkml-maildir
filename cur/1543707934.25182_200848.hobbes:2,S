Hi,
since the merging of the Intel x86_64 (Patchset 1.1557.62.1) there
is a hang on boot very early if processor family is set to AMD Opteron.
Generic X86_64 and Precott/Nocona works both fine.
The only messages with hang are:
Kernel direct mapping tables upto 10100000000@800-C000
Decompressing Linux...done
Booting the kernel.
That's all.
Machine in question:
Tyan Tiger K8W
Dual Opteron 244 C0-Stepping
1 GByte Ram
Compiler used: GCC 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 pre20040221
Thanks
Joachim
