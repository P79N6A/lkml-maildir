This is easily explained: some byte of the mouse protocol was lost.
(Some mouse protocols are even designed to allow
 easy resync/recovery by fixed bit patterns!)
Write an intelligent mouse driver for XFree86 to compensate for
lost bytes.

Probably XFree ignores data packets with XY overflow set. All other
packets move you to top-right corner.
Moving your mouse will quickly show button mania, as described by your post.[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
