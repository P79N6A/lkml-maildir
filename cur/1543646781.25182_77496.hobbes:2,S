At one point, userspace did share this header file.
That hasn't been the case for a while, so this has
been removed.

For most plugins, except the device manager, this operation
was nothing more than an exercise in routing the operation
requests to the underlying devices. Since this routing code
already exists in the ioctl interface, it seemed reasonable
to just reuse it for this purpose as well. As a result,
each plugin had to add 0 lines of code to support this.

In EVMS, because of removable media devices, we chose to
open/close the underlying devices only when an actual
open/close is received for a volume residing on the
devices. This allows removable media devices to remain
unlocked until they are in use.

This ioctl is used by our userspace tools. EVMS stores
metadata at the very end of devices. This ioctl was
initially done to avoid the problem of "short writes"
to those last sectors. It also allows the core to
control which devices userspace can address.

MD uses checksum routines. Rather than duplicating
this code, we provided a method, for our usertools,
of using the kernel routines, especially considering
there is multiple methods based on various
characteristics.
