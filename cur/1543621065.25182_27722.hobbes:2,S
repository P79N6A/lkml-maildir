Eww.  You get these warnings because ksymoops is no longer able to match
up System.map with the kernel ksyms (since you effectively changed the
name of every symbol in System.map).

I don't call this format "better" nor "improved".
It might be better to have something like this following at the end:
File; __get_free_pages: mm/page_alloc.c
File; __pollwait: fs/select.c
File; do_select: fs/select.c
File; process_timeout: kernel/sched.c
File; restore_sigcontext: arch/i386/kernel/signal.c
File; sock_poll: net/socket.c
File; sys_gettimeofday: kernel/time.c
File; sys_select: fs/select.c
File; sys_setitimer: kernel/itimer.c
Maintainer; fs/select.c <viro@math.psu.edu> <tester3@host.org>
Yes, this would involve modifications to ksymoops.  Note how we grouped
the email addresses together, and also how we sorted the symbol to file
list.
This way you don't have to go around cutting random bits of text out of the
middle of lines, and the lines don't wrap column at 80; in other words, it
is more readable.
You also remove some duplication of information, which is always a bonus
IMHO.
