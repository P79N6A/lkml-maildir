[accusys acs7500 lost interrupt]

Probably but with a slightly different model:
        Model Number:       Accusys ACS7500 A2X1
        Serial Number:      A75X000881
I saw some interesting things where an ACS7500 was smart enough to pass the
announced lba48 capability of the disk whereas it could not really handle it.
Do you notice the same issue with a non-lba48 capable disk ?
