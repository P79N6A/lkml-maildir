Hi Haavard, 
I tried to test your patch on AT91RM9200 with Magic SysRq sequence, unfortunately without 
success - SysRq still does not work. You mention "break count increments" where do you check it ? I have 
cat /proc/tty/driver/atmel_serial 
serinfo:1.0 driver revision:
0: uart:ATMEL_SERIAL mmio:0xFEFFF200 irq:1 tx:8554 rx:623 fe:25 RTS|CTS|DTR|DSR|CD|RI
1: uart:ATMEL_SERIAL mmio:0xFFFC0000 irq:6 tx:0 rx:0 CTS|DSR|CD|RI
2: uart:ATMEL_SERIAL mmio:0xFFFC4000 irq:7 tx:0 rx:0 RI
3: uart:ATMEL_SERIAL mmio:0xFFFC8000 irq:8 tx:0 rx:0 DSR|CD|RI
4: uart:ATMEL_SERIAL mmio:0xFFFCC000 irq:9 tx:0 rx:0 CTS|DSR|CD|RI
no any break counter.
BR,
Ivan
