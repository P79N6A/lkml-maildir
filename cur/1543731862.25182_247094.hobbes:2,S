Not fully, actually both are bootable, but the second one gets 
read/write errors after booting, and when accessed after booting from 
another boot device (NFS)
for the other points, actually both cards are used in the same adapter 
hardware. I can switch both cards in ONE system, and the error only 
appears with the newer card.
I found some other subtlety, in the dmesg of the nonworking card there 
is a message:
hdb: C/H/S=0/0/0 from BIOS ignored
which doesnt appear with the working card, so the card is already 
treated differently by the bios, or the different information from the 
bios somehow interfers with hardware probing? (just speculating on this 
point)
I will do some more tests and tell you what i find out.
