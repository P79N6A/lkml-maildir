Now, I think, I am not the only one using emacs. Until now the "linux" 
C-style fitted perfectly with the CodingStyle, now it no longer will. 
Namely, emacs puts as many tabs to indent the continuation line as fit 
(i.e., at tab width = 8 spaces it's just (extra indent / 8) tabs plus 
(extra indent % 8) spaces. Is there a way to make emacs behave compatibly 
to this proposal? If not, I would not like to have to re-indent every such 
line manually or have my patches rejected because of this.
Thanks
Guennadi
