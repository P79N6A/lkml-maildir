Hi,
    Our Cardbus driver was using register_driver/unregister_driver
function  of cb_enabler.c    for registration and unregistration in
RH7.1
But in RH 8.0 , we are not able to find cb_enabler.o file in
/modules/pcmcia directory even when we compile the kernel with PCMCIA
CARDBUS support.
So our Cardbus driver is giving unresolved symbol register_driver and
unregister_driver.
Has this function renamed.
If not where it is?
Please help.
Any pointers will be highly appreciated.
Thanks & regards
Prasanta
