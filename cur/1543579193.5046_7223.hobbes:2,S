I have the ASUS CUV4X.
VIA vt82c686a (cf/cg) IDE UDMA66 controller on pci0:4.1
I also run DMA66 with no problems here.
I never have seen any issues with the PS/2 mouse and X.
I use the Logitech cordless wheel mouse.  I use the "MouseManPlusPS/2"
driver in XFree.  When I was first setting this up (about a year ago)
I had the problems you mention.  I read an article on setting up your
scroll wheel in X and it said to use the IMPS/2 setting.  This was
nothing but trouble, till I RTFM on XFree and mice and found my solution.
Can you tell us what kind of mouse this is and how you have it set up in
XFree.
Let's take this mouse discussion off list as it has nuttin to do with
the kernel....
