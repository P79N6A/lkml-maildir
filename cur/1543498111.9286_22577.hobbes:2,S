_Silenty_ forcing a sti() you was not only hiding a bug that may
cause an IPI deadlock,
but you was also pontentially opening a window for deadlocking in
a spinlock or to race with an irq handler.

The NMI should be the most robust and bug-free part of the CPU since it's
the way the hardware delivers urgent things to do to the CPU (it's been
almost unused for doing useful things in the PC so far of course).
But think if somebody would use
an Intel CPU for an embedded application where he want to use the NMI. Do
you suggest him to not use an Intel CPU because the NMI may trigger CPU
bugs never seen before? If so which CPU does have a relialable NMI
mechanism?
