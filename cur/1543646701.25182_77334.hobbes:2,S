So it seems the way to do this is:
    my_workqueue = create_workqueue("mywork");
    if (!my_workqueue) {
        printk("Unable to create workqueue\n");
        return -EIO;
    }
    pri.sched_priority = 1; /* BM: any nonzero should do, is there any reason 
                               to chose a larger priority? */
    rc = security_ops->task_setscheduler(isr_workqueue->cpu_wq[0]->pid, SCHED_FIFO, &pri);
    if(rc < 0) {
        printk("Unable to set real-time priority for NV (err=%d)\n", rc);
    }
The above code doesn't work though because the struct workqueue_struct is
hidden away in workqueue.c, invisible to modules.  The line:
    isr_workqueue->cpu_wq[0]->pid
bombs because the struct is not defined (dereferencing pointer to incomplete
type).  Is there a better way to get the pid of a workqueue I just created?  Or
for that matter is there a better way to set the scheduler for a workqueue I
just created?  I imagine many drivers would want to do this...
I notice the sched_setscheduler system call is not available in any kernel
header.  What is the proper procedure for calling such a function from a
module?
Cheers,
