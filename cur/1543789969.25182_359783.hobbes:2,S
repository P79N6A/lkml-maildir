gosh, could you please shut up and code now?
There's been various TODO items posted:
 (1) my TODO list for making the core HCIL idependent
 (2) finishing the transition to remove struct scsi_request and only
     send down S/G list
 (3) get rid of legacy host probing
and we'd all be happy if you added to the list.  Talking doesn't change
anything, please submit patches and help moving things forward.  Thanks.
And please start a new thread for such suggestions, this thread has finally
managed to get into my killfile.
