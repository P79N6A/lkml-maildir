I sense a disconnect here.
Seems to me Erich was asking if CKRM could be used _instead_ of cpusets,
and observes that, for now at least, CKRM lacks something.
Seems to me Hubertus is, _in_ _part_, responding to the question of
whether CKRM can be used _within_ cpusets, and claims to be taking a
position opposite to Erich's, protesting that indeed CKRM can be used
within cpusets - CKRM doesn't violate cpus_allowed constraints.
Hubertus - I didn't realize that Erich considered that question, not did
I realize he took that position.
Unfortunately, the plot thickens.  Hubertus goes on it seems to consider
other questions, and I start to lose the thread of his thought.  Such
questions as:
 - can RCFS/controllers set cpus_allowed as do cpusets?
	[ beware that there's more to cpusets than setting cpus_allowed ]
 - can cpusets replace shared based scheduling?
 - can share based scheduling replace cpusets?
 - can CKRM scheduling be allowed within cpusets?
 - are sibling cpusets exclusive?
	[ yes - if the exclusive property is set on them ]
 - can we enforce that a certain task class is limited to a cpuset subtree?
By now I'm thoroughly confused.  Fortunately, Hubertus concludes:
  - If we agree or disagree then we can work on a proposal for this.
Well, since I'm pretty sure from my Logic 101 class that we agree or
disagree, this is good news.  I'm glad to hear we can work on a proposal
on this [ what was 'this' again ...? ;) ]
One thing I am sure of ... either one of Hubertus or myself needs another
cup of coffee, or both Hubertus and I need to have a beer together.
