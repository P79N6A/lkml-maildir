Non sequitur. I mostly agree with the /proc bit, but I also agree that /dev
is not the place for random text output. Simply because many people have no
use for devfs, but need the data being shown.
So, the ways out AFAIKS are:
- /sys directory with system data (a replacement for groveling around in
  kmem) 
- Clean up /proc, and put it back in there. 
Any alternative needs a HPA that just vetoes stuff in bad format or with
stupid names.
