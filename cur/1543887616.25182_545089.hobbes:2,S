Subject: [PATCH 8/19] i386: enable sg chaining
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/16/84

We don't need to do more on x86, there's no iommu to be worried about.
