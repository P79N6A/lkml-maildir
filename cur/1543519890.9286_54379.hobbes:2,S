I am having a similar problem with a relatively high volume webserver 
running Apache. It used to run RedHat 4.x, on a HP Kayak workstation (I 
know, it was not my decision), and was stable as a rock. Then we upgraded 
the machine to RH 6.0, and then RH6.1, with kernels from 2.2.5 to 2.2.13. 
The machine crashes irregularly - sometimes it stays up for 3 days, 
sometimes it crashes 3 times a day. Nothing in the logs, no oops, nothing 
on the console. We replaced the webserver by Mathopd, which gave slightly 
higher uptimes, but the machine kept on crashing. We replaced nics, and 
eventually replaced the hardware to a HP Netserver 60, but nothing helped.
We now separated the mail/ftp service from the web service, with the former 
running on the new box. This setup is very stable: the current uptime is 64 
days, and it gets 60000 POP logins daily (the ftp service is less important).
I re-installed the old box (the HP Kayak) with a fresh RH6.1, installed 
Apache 1.3.9, using the machine as the webserver _only_, and the crashing 
continues. The machine is behind a FW-1 on NT (I have no control over that 
one :-( ), but that machine does not proxy for the web server.
I'm stuck. Any ideas/suggestions??
Ward.
