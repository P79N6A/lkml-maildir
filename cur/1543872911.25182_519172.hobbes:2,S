Hi Sam,
I've tested it and I think all do its work as it should...
But only two points may be additionally changed:
	1) I think it is better to show main dialog title in form:
	"Linux Kernel v.2.6.21-rc3 Configuration - config file: .config"
	2) You've set menu_backtitle with 128 characters may be we
	should set as PATH_MAX+1+128 - to hold a whole config file?
And renaming "Load alternate" to "Open config file..." and
"Save alternate" to "Save config file as..." is fine I guess.
Hey kernel list - what's your comments? :)
