In practice this is pretty much reserved already but I understand the sentiment.
Currently the plan is to work on the core pid namespace and get those functions
merged at least to -mm with a big fat CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL so people
can really understand what we are talking about when we say a
pid_namespace.  Then go through and finish up all converting the rest
of the pid uses that we haven't tackled yet.  There aren't that many
left and most of the remaining conversions only make sense in the
context of a pid namespace.
Currently we are one or two review cycles away from being able to push
out the core pid namespace code.
Further it is actually critical that we have a clone flag for the pid
namespace because unshare is very much harder if it is possible at
all.
Personally if you want to delay it a week or two, until the rest of
the code is ready that is fine.  Mostly getting it out now is about
release early and release often.
