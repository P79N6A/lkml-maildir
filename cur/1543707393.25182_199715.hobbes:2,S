um, it doesn't look like a normal function call.  it looks like a
macro because it's all in upper case.  if this were in a header file
or used more generally, i'd agree with you.  but it's not, it's just a
convenience macro used in 4 places in this one file.
besides, i got this wrong the first time, and combining it all into the
one macro doesn't let me get it wrong.
