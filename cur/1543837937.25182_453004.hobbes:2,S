As you described above, memory for each packet must be allocated (either
from SLAB or from reserve), so network needs special allocator in OOM
condition, and that allocator should be separated from SLAB's one which 
got OOM, so my purpose is just to use that different allocator (with
additional features) for netroking always. Since every piece of
networking is limited (socket queues, socket numbers, hardware queues,
hardware wire speeds an so on) there is always a maximum amount of
memory it can consume and can never exceed, so if network allocator will 
get that amount of memory at the begining, it will never meet OOM, 
so it will _always_ work and thus can allow to make slow progress for 
OOM-capable things like block devices and swap issues. 
There are no special reserve and no need to switch to/from it and 
no possibility to have OOM by design.
