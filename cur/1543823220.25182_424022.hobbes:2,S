Hopefully soon.
I think i386 only gained it very recently, so it can't be _that_ big
a problem.
The real issue is too deeply nested code like the callback hell
we have in some subsystems. Better would be to eliminate that. 2.4
was much nicer in this regard and there has been quite a lot of 
unnecessary complications in this area when the kernel went to 2.6.

The original goal was to make it fit as much as possible on 
the screen when you don't have a serial/net/fireconsole.
But arguably it's less and less useful because the kernel
has gotten so huge that most backtraces are very long and scroll
away anyways.
