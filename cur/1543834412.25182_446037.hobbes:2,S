This is an ondisk corruption - downgrading the kernel will not
resolve it.  The problem must be triggered by a combination of
operations on a directory; I'm certain that if you access inode
24472381 on your filesystem on 2.6.17, that it'll shutdown your
filesystem too.  See the FAQ entry for a description on how to
translate inums to paths, and also the repair -n step to detect
any corruption ondisk.
cheers.
