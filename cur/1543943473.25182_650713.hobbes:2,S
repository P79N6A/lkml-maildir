Grr, I don't know why I am discussing with stubborn and/or arrogant devs like 
you seem to be. But I actually did what you wanted and as *expected* - as I 
said I understand that trivial piece of code you posted - your patch fails 
here for my nforce2:
cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:        832    XT-PIC-XT        timer <---------------- seeing this?
  1:         10   IO-APIC-edge      i8042
  8:          2   IO-APIC-edge      rtc
  9:          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   acpi
 12:         84   IO-APIC-edge      i8042
 14:         38   IO-APIC-edge      ide0
 16:     184026   IO-APIC-fasteoi   eth0
 17:          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   Technisat/B2C2 FlexCop II/IIb/III Digital 
TV PCI Driver
 18:          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   NVidia nForce2
 19:      12460   IO-APIC-fasteoi   nvidia
NMI:          0   Non-maskable interrupts
LOC:      74695   Local timer interrupts
TRM:          0   Thermal event interrupts
SPU:          0   Spurious interrupts
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
And no, I won't test it on my MCP51 as I *know* what happens: As soon as I 
disable hpet, the quirk gets triggered and will lock up my system.
Now stop wasting my time and do your homework!

Then talk to Len Brown, maybe he is able to make you understand.

Actually I don't care anymore. The last time you also didn't really cared for 
what I said about your way of quirking the nforce boards.
I know how to make the kernel behave in this matter, it is just a pity for 
other users, who don't know...
Good luck!
