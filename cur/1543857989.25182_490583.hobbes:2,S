Hmmmm, if I re-read this then my original message wasn't really clear...
I actually wanted to say that I already included Andrew's patches and
because of that I didn't add your patches also. Sorry about that. 
But you're right: we need to fix things as soon as possible.

Most of them don't have the driver model yet and those who have
don't use the miscdev as a "parent". But this is on the roadmap 
as part of the conversion to the generic watchdog structure.
(Hmm, I need to talk to Rudolf Marek again and continue our
conversation about the generic watchdog functionsi -> will do
that tomorrow).
Greetings,
Wim.
