Well using vim as alternate editor a postpone turns into a "ZZ" followed 
by ^O which I don't think is such a big deal but in general I agree that 
it adds hassle.  It is a shame that the text based headers do not appear 
as part of the message in the editor in particular...

I wouldn't know about that.  Never used uemacs.  I am a vim addict myself.
