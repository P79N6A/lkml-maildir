Hi.
I took into account previous remarks, so here is the new version of the 
driver
for the accelerometer present in HP nc6400 laptops. See documentation in the 
patch
for complete feature list. At this point I don't think there is anything 
more that can
be added to this driver and also it works stable for me no matter how I 
tried to abuse it.
Regards
Yan Burman
