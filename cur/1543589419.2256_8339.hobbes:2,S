Matthias,
  I tried pretty much the same thing, and I also tried your patch.
Unhappily when I access my zip drive using the aic7xxx driver my system
becomes pretty much unresposive, just short of locking up completely.
ie at least the emergency alt-sysrq keys still work.
I guess we'll just have to wait for Justin to come out with the real patch...
