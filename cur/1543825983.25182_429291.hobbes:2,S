That's ok. It's not a big deal normally.
It's just when BIOS is broken and assigns overlapping ranges to
multiple devices or mis-routes MMIO address space that we need
this to work right.  The vast majority of BIOS's do get it right
and that's why I'm not terribly worried.
If there is consensus the drivers are wrong, then it's pretty
easy to fix and we don't have to panic.
Do you agree with the change in the text?
