Hmm... I don't have a sound card[1] so I would have never thought that
I have to enable "Sound card support" and "OSS sound modules", then go
to "low level sound drivers" just to get a fully working BTTV driver.

Isn't it unusual to have the code and the configure option is
different directories?
I don't know what else uses the msp3400 code, but for a normal user it
belongs to bttv, not to the sound card section. At least there should
be a note in CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848's help, telling the user to go to the
sound section to enable sound support for bttv.
And maybe rename "Sound card support" to "Sound support", because I
don't see the TV card as a sound card :-)

[1] I do, but I use OSS/Commercial, not the kernel drivers.
