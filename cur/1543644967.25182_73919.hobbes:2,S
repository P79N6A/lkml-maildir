KeepAlive		On  # that is ok
MaxKeepAliveRequests	1000  # that is too high. No Client will request such count. Check your Pages: 
How many Images/Frames/etc you nee per request? Should not reach 100 ;-)
KeepAliveTimeout 15 # that is the key, but that is dangerous. Too high, and you will run out of MaxClients.
But you see that in serverstats ('K')
