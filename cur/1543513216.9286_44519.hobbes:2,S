Hi!
I have a Linux server. The server has a modem it connects my private
LAN (192.168.1.x) to the internet thru IpMasquerading.
I have recently upgraded the server from RedHat 5.2 (2.0.36 kernel)
to RedHat 6.0 (2.2.12 kernel). From upgrade on I experiance a problem that 
*seems* to be related to masquerading.
I open a few ftp connection to *one* ftp server. If files are small there is no
problem, but with larger files at one moment one of the transfers never
finishes (Netscape - same is with NcFTP - keeps it stuck at 100% and it never
finishes). After one tansfer never finishes, *no* transfer finishes. 
If I stop all transfers and reconnect later, everything is OK, until another
transfers hangs at 100%.
I didn't have this kind of problems with 2.0.36 kernel.
Here is my setup:
- kernel 2.2.12
- [/root]# rpm -qa | grep ipchains
   ipchains-1.3.8-3 
- [/root]# cat /etc/rc.d/rc.masq
  #!/bin/sh
  echo "Setting up masquerading."
  /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_ftp
  /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_irc
  /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_quake
  /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_raudio
  /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_cuseeme
  /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_vdolive
  /sbin/modprobe ip_masq_user.o
  # Reset the rules!
  /sbin/ipchains -F
  /sbin/ipchains -P input ACCEPT
  /sbin/ipchains -P output ACCEPT
  /sbin/ipchains -P forward ACCEPT
  /sbin/ipchains -P forward REJECT
  /sbin/ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 -j MASQ
