hi,
in all the license discussions that have gone on here, i haven't seen one
on the supposed gpl 3 happen in a while, so i was wondering, is this really
going to happen?  and does anyone know of the date of it's proposed launch?
and where is a copy of this so i can look at it in the meantime?
thanks
mark.
