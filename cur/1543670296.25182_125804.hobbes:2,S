There are ioctls that will tell you start sector and length.
HDIO_GETGEO gives you start
BLKGETSIZE gives you length
I do not know what you mean by type, but the kernel doesn't know it.
(A partition may be found from a DOS-type or BSD-type or Amiga-type
or ... partition table. Each has its own ways of indicating a type
of partition. A partition can also be created by ioctl where no
partition table is involved. Then there is no type at all.
No type is used by the kernel, roughly speaking.)
