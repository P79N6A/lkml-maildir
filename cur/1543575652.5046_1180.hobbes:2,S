Do not hit 'shift-pgup' while penguin logo is on the screen. Something
somewhere is wrong... (and never hit shift-pgdn; shift-pgup corrupts
screen while shift-pgdn corrupts kernel memory)
Or better, boot with 'video=scrollback:0' (*). I think that we should 
make this default for 2.4, as (except this problem) scrollback code is 
broken for multihead and fix is not trivial.
                                        Best regards,

(*) With matrox in 8bpp you'll get almost always bigger and faster scrollback
with 'video=scrollback:0' than with default 'scrollback:32768' ...
