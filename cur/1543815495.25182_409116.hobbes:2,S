I agree - memset just before use is the Right Thing (tm).
One minor point: There are two cache_alloc entry points: __cache_alloc, 
which is a forced inline function, and kmem_cache_alloc, which is just a 
wrapper for __cache_alloc. Is it really necessary to call __cache_alloc?
The idea is that __cache_alloc is used just by the two high-performance 
paths: kmem_cache_alloc and kmalloc. Noone else should use __cache_alloc 
directly.
