Greetings;
I found some code I can play with/hack/etc, in the form of a loadable 
module and some testing driver programs, in 'dpci8255.tar.gz'.
Unforch its for a slightly different card than the one I have, and 
once I've hacked the code to suit, I need to rebuild it.
So whats the gcc command line to make just a bare, loadable module for 
say a 2.4.25 kernel?   Obviously I'm missing something when it 
complains and quits, claiming there is no 'main' defined, which I 
don't think modules actually have one of those?
What I'm trying to do (hey, no big dummy jokes please :)
[root@coyote dist]# cc -o dpci8255.o dpci8255lib.c
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.3.3/../../../crt1.o(.text+0x18): 
In function `_start':
: undefined reference to `main'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
The gcc manpage isn't that helpfull and I've now read thru it twice.
