Kathy,
How did you check that the driver was asserting the interrupt? (do you have an 
additional way of monitoring it?)  I have yet to fully investigate my problem 
and an additional tool to check if my board is actually asserting the 
interrupt (and to find out how far it gets) would be very handy,
Thanks for the suggestions - more notes below
Thanks,
SA

I am currently inspecting the board config space - I will modify and test - is 
it possible for the config space to be "wrong".

The card and driver share "nicely" with a random assortment of hardware on the 
"good" machines - I will try to get it a unique (or at least different 
interrupt) on the bad machine (it current shares with usb on int 9 which 
never seems to get any interrupts) and see how this pans out

The bad computer function fine in everyway except for the missing interrupts 
from my card - the card and driver are robust in the sense that they can live 
without the interrupts (performance can suffer though) so this problem is in 
the category annoying and anomolous rather than fatal.
