I'm busy trying to track down and eliminate a stack of warnings from
kernel compiles on Alpha.  As you know, a lot of these are trivial
warnings just caused by people making intel assumptions.
1)size_t == int
This causes a lot of "int format, different argument" warnings in
printk's.  While I know that they're not that important, I'd like not
to see these if possible.
What's the normal way to fix these sorts of things?  Is an explicit
cast eg:
diff -ur linux.vanilla/fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c linux/fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c
--- linux.vanilla/fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c	Wed Jul 21 12:05:32 1999
+++ linux/fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c	Wed Jul 21 10:40:29 1999

 				clnt->cl_server);
 			printk(KERN_WARNING "NFS: nr=%d, slots=%d, len=%d\n",
-				nr, (end - p), len);
+				nr, (int)(end - p), len);
 			clnt->cl_flags |= NFS_CLNTF_BUFSIZE;
 			break;
...the approved method?  I think this is quite ugly, but have done it
for all the offending printk's in my config.
2)Similar problems with long int format being passed an int arg.
Such as:
diff -ur linux.vanilla/fs/nfsd/export.c linux/fs/nfsd/export.c

+			nxp->ex_dev, (long)nxp->ex_ino, nxp->ex_flags);
 	dev = to_kdev_t(nxp->ex_dev);
 	ino = nxp->ex_ino;
What do you think?  I have patched my kernel to do these casts, with
(seemingly) no problems.  If there's a "right way" to do it, I'd like
to do it and submit my "warning-squash" patch in its entirety.
If I'm wasting my time, do say.
