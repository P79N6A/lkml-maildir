Sure. But "normally" the user wouldn't bother to pass
auto_brightness=2 to the module in which case we *do* "clean up" after
ourselves and reenable automatic brightness control on module unload.
The special behaviour when auto_brightness=2 is passed is merely a
special feature for those who need it. It was useful to me and was
trivial to implement, and hence I did it.
