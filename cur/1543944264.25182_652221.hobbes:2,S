Will all the users in the world who think about super block location when they 
partition their disks please raise their hands?
The location of the super block needs to be very simple in order for mount and 
friends to find and detect it.  It needs a simple algorithm to try multiple 
locations in case a given copy of the super is corrupt.
Design in this case is a bunch of compromises around other users of the 
hardware, ease of programming, and the benefits in performance or usability 
from doing something complex.

IO is already aligned on sectors, sometimes we'll have a perfect erasure block 
alignment and sometimes not.  When the location of the super is my biggest 
bottleneck, I'll be a very happy boy.
