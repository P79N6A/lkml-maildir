This doesn't help. There are legitimate reasons to use /dev/sg on a
device which is active. For most subsystems this actually makes a lot of
sense when doing things like enclosure control.

Which means it is privilegded.

SG_IO does command filtering, /dev/sg is intended to be assigned
correctly.

I do think so.

The /dev/sg interface cannot do the locking. If you use /dev/sg you are
telling the kernel you what you are doing. If you don't then you'll make
coasters or even bigger messes. 
If you are prepared to fix the apps then I'd suggest fixing them to use
fcntl locks with exclusive lock/shared lock according to their need for
exclusivity. That would fix some of the HAL problems (open has side
effects relocking doesnt), but there are still corner cases with mounted
file systems that need handling and I can see those might need some kernel
helping hands.
