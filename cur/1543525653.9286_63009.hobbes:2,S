IF passwords are there :-) Not always the case. They can be on other system
for example (and no, NIS with a lot of holes is not the only way to do this).

If you had nfs and/or rsh your system was improperly configured to begin with.

Since you are not using ssh or lsh you had problem from the very beginning.

Most capabilities can be exploted when system was already not very
secure. If you have two locks on door and so happen that YOU do not use
one of them it does not mean that the only protection is remaining lock:
someone can have other lock locked ! Yes, each capability has some value
(that's why they are not allowed for "normal" user to begin with) but
to say that each and every one can lead to root is VERY misleading. In
YOUR system -- may be. Not in EVERY system.

Only if there EXIST root on system :-) Once capabilites support added to
filesystem we can remove root (as superuser that is) from system.

This road looks straight ONLY since you not tried to make it harder. NFS and
rsh are just plain invitations for intruders for example. Systems can be
designed differently and only few basic capabilities can be exploited in
ALL systems.
