I think there might be problems when you use make-kpkg's 
--append-to-version option.  make-kpkg works out what the original 
version string should be and then tacks the extra bit on before 
overriding the original version.
More an argument for fixing make-kpkg to be less stupid I suppose.
Of course, the tool I'm using was derived from make-kpkg some time ago 
and could be broken and the proper (and newer) make-kpkg works fine.
