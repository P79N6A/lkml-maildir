Hello!
This is a repost of my previous message, which came out garbled.  Now you 
should be able to run patch -pO from the root linux dir on the files...
There is a bug in driver.c of not freeing memory on error 
paths.  buf.pointer is allocated but not freed if copy_to_user fails.  The 
addition I made was to kfree buf.pointer before returning -EFAULT.  Thanks!
Philip
