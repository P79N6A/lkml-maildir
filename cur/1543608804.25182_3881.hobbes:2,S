Hello,
I've just compiled 2.4.14 (with the latest lm-sensors and ext3 patches,
but that shouldn't matter) and it seems to work well so far, except:
 - drivers/block/loop.c has two deactivate_page() calls, and that
   function no longer exists, so the final link fails (I simply
   removed these calls, is that OK?)
 - fs/isofs/compress.c gives two gcc warnings about redefining
   these evil min/max macros :)
Thanks, and keep up the good work!
Marek
