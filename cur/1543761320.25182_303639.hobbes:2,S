I am considering buying an Averatec AV6210X60, which uses this chipset.
A description of the chipset is here:

The marketing blurb incudes this:
Furthermore, the SiSM741 chipset incorporates SiS's revolutionary
HyperStreaming™ Technology, which provides multiple divided pipelines
for data, allows data to be sent concurrently, and separates data for
easier memory retrieval, resulting in a remarkable reduction in
latency versus traditional chipsets.  Has support for this been
implemented?
Also mentioned is the SiS162 wireless networking chipset.
Here is the machine I am thinking of purchasing:

It seems like an excellent deal.

But, luckily, found:

which documents VIA's failure to support Linux.
Thanks,
