It means to get in touch with people who are affected.  Yes, that's the
tough part.
Regarding features that are overdue for removal according to
feature-removal-schedule.txt:
I remember that at least one person used to watch for due dates for
feature removal, wrote the removing patches, and sent them to the
appropriate lists and maintainers.  This either got rid of the obsolete
stuff, or it turned up reasons why some feature could not be removed
just yet and how to update feature-removal-schedule.txt to correctly
reflect that.
So, as they say, Patches Are Welcome.
