The multwrite errors are gone. Thank you.
I hesitate to bring this up but, after about 6 hours of using pre15+patch,
named coughed up some errors, dumped core, and died. When I tried to see what
was going on, I got some "No processes avalable" messages and then the system
stabilized. I have never seen either of these things happen before. Normally,
I wouldn't think it's IDE related but you never know.
Also, your patch wants to go 9 lines earlier for me. I unpacked a fresh 2.2.13
and applied all the patches and I get the same result. I don't know if it's
important.
