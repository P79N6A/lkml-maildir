Wakko,
We have recently put together the Linux Terminal Server Project
for managing diskless workstations running Linux.  Take a look at
http://www.ltsp.org
.

Why are you getting the timeouts on bootp?  We don't have
any problem with that, and we have setup hundreds of workstations.

We have handled the location of the root filesystem by
using the 'rp=' entry in the bootptab file.  It works
just fine for us.  We setup the root to be /tftpboot/lts/ltsroot
and it boots just fine.
