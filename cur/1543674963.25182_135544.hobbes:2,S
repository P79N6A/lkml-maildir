Linus,
It seems there are a handful of zero-length but not deleted files in
the BK tree, but which are not present in the tarball releases and
also removed by make distclean.  These can cause irritating spurious
diffs - could you "bk rm" these from linux-2.5?  The files are:
	include/pcmcia/bus_ops.h
	include/pcmcia/driver_ops.h
	include/sound/pcm_sgbuf.h
	sound/core/pcm_sgbuf.c
