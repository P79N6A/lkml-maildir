Subject: DMA to user space for framegrabber HOW?

I remember a discussion of how to DMA directly to user space recently, but
can't remember the details and wasn't interested in it.
Now I am because I need write a framegrabber driver and want to get the
maximum number of frames/s out of it. If I remember correctly, the solution
was to mmap the user space buffer to kernel space and then DMA to that.
Is there example code? What if I wish to use th MIT SHM extension for X to
transfer the data to the X framebuffer? Is it possible this way to
tell the PCI framegrabber card to DMA more or less directly to the video
card (which is also PCI of course)? The data doesn't need to be processed,
the framegrabber hardware arranges things to that the data is already in the
right format needed for X.

Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.            --unknown source
