Linux does have a lot of problems with physical memory being used by file
systems, particularly those that need a lot of it.  The "...could not get a
free page..." error from kmalloc can be nasty, particularly since it's error
return code for GFP_KERNEL is undefined, and can cause system crashes.  I've
put the same file system code base on both NT and Linux, and Linux seems to
get into serious problems when you exhaust the physical memory pool.  What
makes it even more convoluted for programmers is the fact that vmalloc
doesn't support a robust byte allocator, which means you have to write your
own.  At some point, something similar to the ExAllocPagePool and
ExAllocNonPagedPool calls in Windows NT should be implemented in the MM for
those of us who don't like being forced to dance around the current
limitations in the Linux kernel with regard to robust vm memory management.
