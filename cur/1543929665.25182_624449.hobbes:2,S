Yo,
Can someone tell me what the current collective thinking is about
calling io_apic_sync during interrupt masking?
This has changed several times recently, and is different between x86
IA32 and x86_64. As Ingo noted a long while back, it should be fine, but
consistency is a nice thing. With that in mind, I'm thinking that the
shared io_apic files could do with a nice cleanup - one has inlines, the
other has DO_ACTION macros that are wrapped, etc.
Jon.
