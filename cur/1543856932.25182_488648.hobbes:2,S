It happens right after booting.
I've since disabled the NFS server on that box, and just tried to
manually start it, and it gives me this:
# /usr/sbin/exportfs -r
bigred:/video/rec: Cannot allocate memory
That is the first and only export:
# cat /etc/exports
# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be
exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
/video/rec      bigred(rw,sync)
strace on exportfs shows this:nfsservctl(0x3, 0xbf875824, 0)          =
- -1 ENOMEM
After that, /proc/fs/nfs/export exists and gives the Oops, while
/proc/fs/nfsd/export doesn't exist.
I don't think however this box is particularly short on memory:
MemTotal:       248704 kB

(this is right after booting, DVB drivers loaded and VDR running.)
Will try your patch tomorrow.
