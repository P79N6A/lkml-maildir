Or put it again into 2.3 or whatever. I still don't like to have dead
code,
however wonderfull, around. And in esp. I don't like it in something as
vital
as the allocator. Even after my patch, there appears to be still
*PLENTY*
of room for other simplifications/optimizations in slab.c. 
And just please put it in, only if it get's real usage, wich would
actually
proove that this is something desirable. Academic exercises aren't 
very usefull for the sake fo theyr own. However the past two years show
that 
this isn't soemthing going to happen any time soon.
BTW. Please take a look at the many free_list buffer_header mechanisms
in the kernel which are giving a hint on how the kernel already quite
perfectly
avoids unnecessary reinitializations on object reusal.
