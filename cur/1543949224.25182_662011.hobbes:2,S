Hi Adrian,
you're right and I'm expecting Bart's input on that. However, removing
tape support in ide altogether is probably not the right thing to do and
Bart wanted to keep some kind of a basic, ide-tape "light" version in so,
yes, the above commit is misleading.
Here's a fix, Bart please apply.

Keep a light version of the driver in for the
small amount of ide tape hardware still using it.
