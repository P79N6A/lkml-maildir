Do you even have DMA enabled for the DVD drive?  Without it it will be
very slow and painful for the CPU.  I also have noticed that many fast
(16x) DVD writers must have an 80 wire cable or they won't work
correctly and do nasty things to the system.
Check /proc/ide/hdX/settings|grep dma and see if it says 1 0 1 or 0 0 1.
