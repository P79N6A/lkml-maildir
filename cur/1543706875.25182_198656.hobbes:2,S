I'm joining this thread rather late, so perhaps I missed something. What 
hardware is the test being ran on? I have an AMD MPX based setup which 
suffers from a chipset bug which effectively limits writes to ~25MB/sec to 
devices connected via the 768 southbridge. Maybe something similar with your 
hardware?
