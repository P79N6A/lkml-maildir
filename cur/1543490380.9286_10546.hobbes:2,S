<sigh> I've been bit by the same thing.  The mouse maintainer is working
on a solution, but until then you'll need to kludge around it by applying
the patch below.  Just be _sure_ you actually have a mouse installed,
though, or the keyboard will lock solid.  Clearly not a long-term solution
<g>.  I'll bet your 486 uses a UMC chipset, correct?  My problem-child
here is a Biostar MB-8433UUD (aka MPB4PB2) with AMD-5x86-133 (P75+).
