And unlike this particular scsi layer usage, such drivers will be
dependant upon things like CONFIG_PCI and thus won't get compiled
in unless CONFIG_PCI has been enabled in the kernel configuration.
The enumeration can go into some common area that doesn't care about
the dma-mapping.h actual implementation.
And linux/dma-mapping.h is a bad name to use, call it dma-dir.h or
something, because linux/dma-mapping.h would need to include
asm/dma-mapping.h which is what we're trying to avoid here.
