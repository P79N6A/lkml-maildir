Do you mean that VPID patch does not include this? Absolutely.
VPIDs are not to limit access, the patch virtualizes pids, rather
than deals with access policy.
Take the whole openvz. Make patch -R < vpid_patch. The result is perfectly
working openvz. Only pids are not virtual, which does not matter. Capisco?

Not "private", but "virtual". VPIDs are made only for migration, not for fun.
And word "private" is critical, f.e. for us preserving some form of pid
space is critical. It is very sad, but we cannot do anything with this,
customers will not allow to change status quo.

Believe me, it is surprizingly small.
