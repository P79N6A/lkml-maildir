I want you to prove the three things your statement says:
 - that this code is only implementable via a bad hack, and your idea is 
   implementable via a better hack
 - Andre's Code is - without a look at it - ugly
 - Unification changesets stay untested

Because we can't tell Linux users "your (once favorite) CD-ROM is not 
implemented in Linux (any more), and will never ever be". If we explicitly 
exclude hardware, where do we end?!
