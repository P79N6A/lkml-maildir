yes, we may protect it by such lock, but this lock have to be held all time
ext3_new_block() uses some b_committed_data because last one may be freed
during current ext3_new_block(). I don't think it's good.
probably, another solution is do not free b_committed_data if it's referenced
by new transaction and make copy from b_frozen instead of freeing it.
