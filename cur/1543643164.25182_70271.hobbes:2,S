 for what its worth, MSC.Linux supports it on IA32 and IA64 :-)
 In my opinion the non-inclosure in the mainline kernel is the most 
important reason not to use XFS (or any other FS). Which in turn 
massively reduces the tester base. It is a shame, because for some type 
of applications it performs great, or better than anything else.
