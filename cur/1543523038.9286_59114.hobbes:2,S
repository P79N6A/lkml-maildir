Hi,
  i'm having problems with my telnet sessions,  i had about 50 windows boxes
connected to a linux machine when there was a blackout.  The linux box is on
UPS so it wasn't affected but all the windows pc's crashed.  What's
interesting is that even though everyone was off the network all the
processes kept on running...  I tried modifying values in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive* but that did not seem to help.  Thanks in
advance!
Ralf
