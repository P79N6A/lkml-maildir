you're totally right. like in another patch i sent at the same time i
messed up the description. as you point out it should read "Use mutex
instead of binary semaphore in idt77252 driver". in the last days i
reported some spinlock related bugs, i suppose that made me write
spinlock instead of mutex ...
thanks for your comments
