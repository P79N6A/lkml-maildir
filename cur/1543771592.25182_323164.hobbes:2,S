> Subject: [Bugme-new] [Bug 4340] New: ohci_1394 module breaks S3 suspend
Firewire suspend/resume is not supported, nothing new...
> Subject: [Bugme-new] [Bug 4371] New: Battery doesn't work after suspend
Duplicate of 4340.
[Bugzilla is piece of ****. This is listed as severity=high, which is
not realistics AFAICT. Also to mark it as duplicate, I need to change
it to ASSIGNED, first. Ugly].
> Subject: [Bugme-new] [Bug 4390] New: power saving doesn't work on
Its standby that does not work... I could fix the subject if stupid
bugzilla let me. Oops.

-rc1 is quite old, i think these can be safely ignored now...

Ignore this. Changing config is *not* okay in 2.6.12 swsusp. Its even
documented:
 *
 * If you change kernel command line between suspend and resume...
 *                              ...prepare for nasty fsck or worse.
 *
 * If you change your hardware while system is suspended...
 *                              ...well, it was not good idea.
 *
> Subject: Re: [PATCH 6/6]suspend/resume SMP support
I do not think we want to support SMP suspend/resume in 2.6.12... It
should work in -mmX, but is still too much in flux.
