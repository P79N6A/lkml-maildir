Andrew,
	CPUset was used in this patch series primarily because it
represent a task-grouping mechanism already in the kernel and because
people at the BoF wanted to start with something simple. The idea of using 
cpusets here was not to push this as a final solution, but use it as a means to 
discuss the effects of task-grouping on CPU scheduler.
We had be more than happy to work with the ckrm core which was posted last.
In fact I had sent out the same cpu controller against ckrm core itself last
time around to Nick/Ingo.

Agreed. Using CPUset interface makes sense mainly for cpu and memory.
