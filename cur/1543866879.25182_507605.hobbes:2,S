You are assuming a perfect world where driver authors have complete
knowledge of their devices. In reality, many drivers (including
those I have the mixed pleasure of maintaining) are based at least
in part on reverse engineering, and managing power states may well
fall into the domain of things not yet sufficiently reverse
engineered.

But if I just write an empty routine like that I open myself up to
criticism along the lines of "writing dummy routines just in order
to shut up kernel warnings". BTDT.

I don't doubt your basic assessment. However it doesn't translate that
easily into a real implementation. In my case, I maintain a USB driver,
so I have to deal with USB specifics of suspend/resume which happen not
to be that well documented. My driver provides an isdn4linux device but
isdn4linux knows nothing about suspend/resume so I am on my own on how
to reconcile the two. The device itself, though in turn far from trivial,
is actually the least of my worries.

No I don't. See above.

Well, that's a common fallacy about applying any logic consistently.
There's a continuum of usefulness from "hardly works at all" through
"causes random memory corruption", "doesn't support power management",
and "does not support some esoteric protocol variety no one ever heard
of anyways" up to "supports any and all uses to which anyone could
possibly want to put the device". I would argue that "doesn't support
power management" is *much* farther up that ladder than, for example,
"causes random memory corruption".
