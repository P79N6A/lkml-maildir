OK, I'll move the CD drives to the VIA IDE ports and see what happens.
That'll be fun changing around boot drive assignments... And yes, my DVD
drive in my other machine is connected to another Promise Ultra66TX2, and it
works fine under Windows XP.
In the PCI listing, there is an Adaptec PCI SCSI card, but that's just for a
tape drive. I have four hard drives, all as masters (single devices) on the
VIA and FastTrak IDE channels.
Thanks for the info, I'll report back results after I get a chance to open
the machine up.
