Well, _GNU_SOURCE and _BSD_SOURCE only get defined, and only by some
oddballs that aren't relevant here.

But yes, _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED definitely does some damage to
curses.h.  However, I don't see how that's relevant to strings.h
or the others I need.  There's no "config" for "compatibility".
Welcome to Linux vs Unix. :)
What I do know is (a) it worked before the header changes and (b)
the patch I just gave you works.  If the patch doesn't break others,
can we just leave it in?
