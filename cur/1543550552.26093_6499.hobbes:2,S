Well, being just an end customer, I would not judge technical quality of
RedHat
packages,   but should note that they have been extremely responsive with
the bugs reports I have submitted.   The longest wait for a reply I ever had
was 4 days,   usually I was geting replies within 48 hours.  I guess you were
asking your questions in a  language  similar to the one you used in your
message
here :(
