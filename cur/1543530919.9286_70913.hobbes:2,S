Ummm - yes it is. If the "deferring memory allocation" means that someone else
can use the resources instead then the bookkeeping is not tracking the
allocated (but not yet used) memory. It HAS been allocated to the first
process. If it also allocated to another process then you a double dipping
and eventually that will kill one, two, or all processes.

Not talking about the modification of process page tables to add a data page
to them. We are talking about not modifing the process page tables when that
modification causes the users total number of pages (used) exceeds the users
quota limit.

That still doesn't disable it. The OOM condition still occurs.

It should change when something better is available. The techniques are
available. They should be used.
Overcommit is usefull on single user workstations where it has been
determined that its use is proper.
Overcommit is VERY BAD when used where significant damage ensues when a
failure occurs. Multi-user servers and embeded systems are two such areas
where overcommit causes serious problems.
Now for a slightly odd set of possiblities:
1. Which is more reliable a) Linux b) NT ?
2. Which would you want firing missiles at you?
3. What happens if the ship goes OOM ocassionaly?
Guess the OS used for the ship?
