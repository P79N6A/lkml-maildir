Hm that should have read, for you:
I don't object implementing support for larger sizes.
(But I wonder how that should work without FB/CVIDIX/SVGA/VESA extensions.)
Note that I was assuming that no FB is used:

What benefits does it actually bring? Your standard VGA knows 256/512
glyphs, and trying to display combined characters needs a
precomposed glyph.

For everything beyond Latin, fbiterm should work a lot better.

Making VC use a 16x32 font may be possible, but then you will also
need 4 glyph positions in a 4096 byte font to create a character.
Or the hardware needs to support 'non-standard' (that would be
8x8,12,14,16) fonts.
