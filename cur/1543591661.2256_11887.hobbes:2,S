free doesn't show any info about allocator state at allocation failure
time.  If you were to modify mm/page_alloc.c:__alloc_pages() to do a
show_mem() along with the printk, you'd likely see that you're close
to being completely oom at that moment.

Posting /proc/slabinfo content might give the vm wizards an idea where
your memory is sitting.
If you see any indications of a sustained leak, I can provide you with
a 2.4.4 ikd patch (toolkit.. contains a memory leak detector) to try on
a non-mission-critical box.  It's large, 731003 uncompressed.
