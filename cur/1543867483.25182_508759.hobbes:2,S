Bear with me Ben, and let's follow this up :) If you are in the middle of 
an MMX copy operation, inside the syscall, you are:
- Userspace, on task A, calls sys_async_exec
- Userspace in _not_ doing any MMX stuff before the call
- We execute the syscall
- Task A, executing the syscall and inside an MMX copy operation, gets a 
  page fault
- We get a schedule
- Task A MMX state will *follow* task A, that will be put to sleep
- We wake task B that will return to userspace
So if the MMX work happens inside the syscall execution, we're fine 
because its context will follow the same task being put into sleep.
Problem would be to preserve the *caller* (userspace) context. But than 
can be done in a lazy way (detecting if task A user the FPU) like we're 
currently doing it, once we detect a schedule-out condition. That wouldn't 
be the most common case for many userspace programs in any case.
