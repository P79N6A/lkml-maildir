Since this code is the i386 architecture branch, I think it's safe to
assume that ExtINT always emanates from something that is 8259A
compatible. The Intel APIC / IOAPIC and MP specifications which govern
this architecture are quite specific on this point. The same is true for
x86_64.

Agreed. Any IO-APIC is fair game for virtual wire routing.

MP tables on IA32 / AMD64 systems are frequently wrong when it comes to
interrupt mappings. That's an indirect consequence of Microsoft
mandating ACPI  since 2000: system vendors tend to test the hell out of
that configuration and nothing else.
But I think it's a good idea to cross check as Linus suggests, and
notify the user of any discrepancy. After all, the only *guaranteed* way
to get back into virtual wire mode on a platform is to do a reset; the
original MP spec didn't envisage supporting this mode of operation.
