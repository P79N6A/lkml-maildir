Well . . . if *that* is a reason for disliking open source then the 
problem is solved.
We don't really need the source for their driver with the sneaky hacks 
exposed.
They could keep a proprietary driver with nasty hacks, and release a 
simplified
one (basically the same code with those hacks removed) along with the 
specs. 
Open source developers can then add their own hacks if need be.
