I expect that got fixed in later kernels.
Beware that 2.6.24-rc5 is uselessly buggy, so
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/patch-2.6.23-rc5-git1.gz
would be a better kernel to test to check that we fixed this warning.

A *large* number of people need noapic or nolapic to get Linux to work.

Are you able to provide us with more information about this bug?  A digital
photograph of the screen would suit, or perhaps you can generate a full
trace with netconsole (Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt), although
suspend+netconsole tends to be a bad (and recently worsening) combination.

Thanks.  Please continue to do so.

My Vaio reliably hangs at the same place with 2.6.23-rc4.  I'll bisect that
next week sometime.  Hopefully the result of that effort will fix your bug.
 Please test Linus's tree regularly and don't let us release 2.6.23 until
it is fixed.

Please provide full details in a separate bug report.  Send that report to
myself, linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org, Jaroslav Kysela <perex@suse.cz> and
Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>
Thanks.
