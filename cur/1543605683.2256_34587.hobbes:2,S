Some month ago (about at 2.4.6 kernel) I've got the same problem with my
DDS3 (the TAPE CORRUPTION thread). 64 bytes more or less aligned at page
boundary. Tought it was the tape driver, it was an Adaptec driver issue
(back to when you needed Berkeley DB to compile the firmware)!
Now it works perfectly (and I've got an infamous Asus A7V...). BTW no HDD
on secondary IDE, only a CDROM :)
