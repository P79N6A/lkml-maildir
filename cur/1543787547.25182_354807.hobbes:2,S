Sounds like a thinly veiled threat and/or very effective
prodding ;-).
It is not there yet only because I simply have not got around to
it, but it will happen before 0.99.8.
I suspect the version Linus posted has a funny interaction with
'git-pull'; 'git pull --tags' by mistake, or intentionally to
file a bug report to annoy me ;-), would create an Octopus out
of those tags, if I am not mistaken.

yet please send a patch with commit log and signoff to add the
latest, and I will apply it.
