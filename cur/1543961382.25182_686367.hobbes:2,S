Subject: [PATCH] x86 DMA: Handle devices assigned to the guest by the host
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/29/140

dma_alloc_coherent() doesn't call dma_ops->alloc_coherent in case no IOMMU
translations are necessary. However, if the device doing the DMA is a
physical device assigned to the guest OS by the host, we need to map
all the DMA addresses to the host machine addresses. This is done via
hypercalls to the host.
In KVM, with pci passthrough support, we can assign actual devices to the
guest OS which need this functionality.
