I know. I'm thinking of adding power_{off,on} to the core and getting rid
of the level parameter to the suspend/resume functions (like how I changed
system devices). That would require an additional hook to the PCI drivers
so that the call is propogated down to the low-level driver. If that's the
case, then we should add both to struct pci_driver at once.
