You can try my load balancing patch at 
ftp://sliepen.warande.net/pub/eql/.
It works for 2.2.14. There are lots of drawbacks though: it only works for
outgoing traffic (unless your uplink uses a similar thing) and you need to
be able to use the same IP address on both interfaces (which most ISPs
won't allow). But maybe this is what you're looking for.
