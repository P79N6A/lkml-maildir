When I was looking at this, I was pretending to be just somebody looking
at sysv code, with no knowledge of containers or namespaces.
For a person like that, I think names like _space or _ns are pretty much
not an option, unless those terms become as integral to the kernel as
things like kobjects.

This was just the first patch. :)

Any particular reason why?  There seem to be a number of things done in
there that aren't _strictly_ needed under the tasklist_lock.  Where
would you do it?

Yeah, I saved shm for last because it has the largest number of outside
interactions.  My current thoughts are that we'll need _contexts or
_namespaces associated with /proc mounts as well.

Ahhh, as in
	struct ipc_ns;
And just keep a pointer from the task?  Yeah, that does keep it quite
isolated.
