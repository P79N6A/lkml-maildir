Yes, this is the case for the ACPI hotplug driver, for example.

*sigh*.  Greg rejected a patch that did that.  He wanted it fixed
more generally.

I can't use it in the symbios driver because it only exists on alpha,
arm, mips, parisc, ppc, ppc64, sparc64 and v850.  It doesn't exist on
i386, ia64, x86_64, arm26, cris, h8300, m32r, sh, sh64 or sparc.
Perhaps from your point of view this patch makes more sense as a cleanup.
Rather than having all the duplicate code in all the architecture
pcibios_fixup_device and pcibios_resource_to_bus, they can implement
pci_bus_to_phys and pci_phys_to_bus.
