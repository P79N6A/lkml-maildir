When your machine shuts down, all md arrays are automatically switched to
read-only *after* the root filesystem has been unmounted.  You should
get a message 
    md: stopping all md devices.
if you get e.g.
    md: md0 still in use.
*after* that message then there might be a problem.  Otherwise
everything should be fine.
That being said, it is possible that your patch is OK.  I've been
meaning to review the rules for switching an array to read-only for
ages, but it never got to the top of the todo list.  e.g. do you want
to be able to switch an array to read-only when a filesystem is
mounted read-write off it.  If you don't, how do you check?  If you
do, what about in-flight write requests?  Do you need to wait for them
to complete? How? It isn't as straight forward as one might like.
