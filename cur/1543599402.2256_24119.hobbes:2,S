That status is from the Rx, not Tx. I think they are all ok.
005e9700 - length=0x5e, RxOK, accept broadcast, single buffer, end buffer
00668f00 - length=0x66, RxOk, chain buffer, single buffer, end buffer

8000 means that the chip is still doing a software reset. I think the
difference between 085a/081a is simply that you caught it in different
states.

Is this after unloading the module? The via_rhine_close sets the
transmitter to loopback mode (comment says to avoid hardware races ...).
The reset code does not.
That should not be a problem, when loading the module (and on reset) it
changes this to normal mode.

That is interesting. This code should be almost identical to 2.4.x (or
not, Dennis?). The way the timeout code is run may be different of course,
but the driver part is the same.
I'm ignoring that for now (if you don't mind) and have made a patch with
some possible improvements. Someone found a modified driver on some dlink
server that contains (claimed) workarounds for various chip peculiarities
(bugs).
I also added a "force software reset" that is described in the datasheet.
Not sure what the difference is, but it can't hurt trying that if the
normal reset fails.
Perhaps this helps, probably not.
