Can't.  I -remember- it being in the source tree last time I looked
(lmcd.c or something like that) but it's -gone-.  Suspect noone updated it
and then people got tired of it hanging around and ousted it.  I suppose I
could try to hack one up from an old source somewhere but I don't know.
G'day, eh? :)
