We're talking about a real life situation, not a "what if".  The real
life situation is that both X and xosview spend most of their time
asleep and so binding them to a given CPU simply doesn't enter the
picture; and that when they wake up, the scheduler is *required* to
schedule them both as soon as possible (that's an unbreakable, hard
requirement for interactive tasks).  If they are both awake at some
point in time --- let's say, xosview has logged more data and has sent
it to X for display --- then the scheduler is required to run them both
in preference to any background computation.  
Sorry, but in this case you just don't have the option of leaving your
background task running and scheduling only one of the two runnable
interactive tasks.
