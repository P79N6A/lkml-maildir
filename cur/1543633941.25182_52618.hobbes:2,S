Hi,
I got the following error at the final linking stage of 2.4.19-pre10
(updated to ChangeSet 1.546 from Marcelo's BK repository):
<--  snip  -->
...
drivers/video/video.o: In function `sstfb_remove':
drivers/video/video.o(.text+0x6255c): undefined reference to `local
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
<--  snip  -->
The problem is that sstfb_remove is __devexit and calls sst_shutdown which
is __exit. This causes the error above when CONFIG_HOTPLUG is set.
I suggest the following fix:
--- drivers/video/sstfb.c.old	Sun Jun 16 14:22:03 2002
+++ drivers/video/sstfb.c	Sun Jun 16 14:23:56 2002

-static void  __exit sst_shutdown(struct sstfb_info *sst_info)
+static void  __devexit sst_shutdown(struct sstfb_info *sst_info)
 {
 	struct pci_dev * sst_dev = sst_info->dev;
 	struct pll_timing gfx_timings;

time explaining its a free country because its a police state.
