Hi,
IMHO you should now switch off lockdep ("Lock debuging: ..." options),
until you update or get some patch for this circular problem.  Your
logs should be sufficient to nfsd people and lockdep turns off checking
after this anyway. I don't know if this is a known and real locking
problem, but it could be interesting now, if workqueue error would
reapear. It seems nfsd code is breaking somewhere with locks held -
maybe because of problems with lockdep's error handling.

Jarek P.
