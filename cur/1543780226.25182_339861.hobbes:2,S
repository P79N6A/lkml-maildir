That's a valid argument. But an if is an if for the reader.
It is a conditional he has to be aware of and it usally has
no idention, if it is just inside "#if" instead of "if ()".
I have seen people seen missing "#if 0" [1] around code while 
reading it. Missing an normal if () is harder with proper idention.
A normal conditional has also the advantage, that the compiler
checks the code for syntactic and some semantic errors within it.
In an "#if 0" you can basically write any plain text[2] and any error
will go undetected, until it becomes an "#if 1".
Since your define is true for most compilations out there,
this argument is not very strong.
Last argument: Many kernel developers -- including Linus -- 
don't like "#if" in C files and prefer them in headers. 
Their reasons might be similiar to my own.
