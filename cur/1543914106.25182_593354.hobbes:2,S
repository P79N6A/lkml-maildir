For mlock()ed sure. Not for pagetables though, kmalloc slabs etc. It
might be a non-issue as well. Like the large block patches, there are
aspects of Andrea's case that we simply do not know.

Regreattably, this is also woefully difficult to prove. For
fragmentation, I can look into having a more expensive version of
/proc/pagetypeinfo to give a detailed account of the current
fragmentation state but it's a side-issue.

Well, we do extend the internal fragmentation problem. Previous, it was
inode, dcache and friends. Now we have to deal with internal
fragmentation related to page tables, per-cpu pages etc. Maybe they can
be solved too, but they are of similar difficulty to what Christoph
faces.

Being able to use the per-cpu queues is a big plus.

Neither do I. Andrea's suggestion definitly has upsides. I'm just saying
it's not going to cure cancer any better than the large block patchset ;)

Fair point.
What way to jump now is the question.
