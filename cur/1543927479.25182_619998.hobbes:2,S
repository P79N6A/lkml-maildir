Next time I'm doing something significant there,
I'll collect some data for you.  Got other work now.
But it does make sense that this mechanism cannot be longterm for
a desktop.  Intensive loads come and go quickly there, and the
interrupt handling has to respond in a timely fashion.
It's not like a server where loads generally increase/decrease gradually.
