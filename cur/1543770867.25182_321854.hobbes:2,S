Bill, you can belittle me to your heart's content. It really
doesn't bother me in the slightest.
Whenever you or anyone else try to complicate the Linux kernel
with hard-RT stuff, I'm going to ask exactly the same questions
because I don't think you know how a nanokernel solution would
work, or even what kind of services a hard-RT Linux would need
to provide.
