There isn't any 1:1 thing - the device/bus-oriented one should _not_ show
virtual things like partitions etc that have no relevance for a driver,
while /dev (and thus devfs) obviously think that that is the important
part, much more important than how we actually got to the device.
I think we need to have some way of getting a mapping from /dev ->
devicefs, but I don't think that has to be a filesystem thing (it might
even be as simple as just one ioctl or new system call: 'get the "path" of
this device').
There aren't that many people who actually care, I suspect.
