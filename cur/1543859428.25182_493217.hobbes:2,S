 No support in the hardware for that.  Even revision 3 of the board which 
is the last one and the only to support PCI 2.2 says:
Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 2
        Flags: PMEClk- DSI- D1- D2- AuxCurrent=0mA PME(D0-,D1-,D2-,D3hot-,D3cold-)
        Status: D0 PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-
