Hi Jens,
Hey thanks for doing so much hard work with this, I couldn't have fixed
all the block layer stuff myself. QRCU looks like a good solution for the
barrier/sync operations (/me worried that one wouldn't exist), and a
novel use of RCU!
The only thing I had been thinking about before it is ready for primetime
-- as far as the VM side of things goes -- is whether we should change
the hard calls to address_space operations, such that they might be
avoided or customised when there is no backing block device?
I'm sure the answer to this is "yes", so I have an idea for a simple
implementation... but I'd like to hear thoughts from network fs / raid
people?
Nick
