I wonder if we are killing a fly with a sledgehammer. On SunOS 4.1.4 I
just patched the top of stack with a NULL pointer. With SPARC the kernel
uses different registers than the user and don't recall their being a
problem with a NULL pointer being at the top of the kernel stack. Is
there a problem with the i386 architecture with the top of the kernel
stack having a NULL pointer? My guess is that it's needed to return
to the right place in user space.
