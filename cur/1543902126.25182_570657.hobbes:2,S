At least for cpusets (the mother of all containers), notify on release
is part of the user visible API of cpusets.  The kernel does not remove
cpusets; it runs a user program, /sbin/cpuset_release_agent.  That
program might choose to rmdir the cpuset directory, and/or do other
actions, like notify a batch scheduler that one of its cpusets was
released.
That API is not as sacrosanct as some, but it is working, and I wouldn't
want to break it without good reason.
