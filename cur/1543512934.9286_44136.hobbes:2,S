I've seen this a number of times on my machine (AMD k6-450 single
processor, 2 WD EIDE hd's, and a peice of crap all-in-one mobo).  And
other people are reporting the same problem.
Yet at the same time, noone is really sure what is causing it.  If you
know please speak up.  I'm highly desperate to find out whats wrong.
One user tracked his problem down to APM.  I've tried his patch.  Didn't
work.  I've tried 2.2.13pre17.  Didn't work.  Tried increasing my
swap.  Didn't work.
I've also been told it might be my mobo.  But I doubt everyone that has
had this problem is using the same mobo as me.
But with my problem, every Call Trace was ending with this.
[make_8259A_irq+16/52]
And was told that the 8259 is a 'nasty chip'.  Having 2 cascaded into each
other.  And IRQ 16 shouldn't actually exist and could be an example of the
8259 chip screwing up under bad configuration (SIS motherboard and/or a
Redhat bug).
