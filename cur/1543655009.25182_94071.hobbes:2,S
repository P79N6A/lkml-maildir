I think what you mean is that, if there is a
restart_function (i.e. the block is set up) and the return
is -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK, then change eax (x86 ) to call
sys_restart which would in turn call the function in the
restart_block.
One of the problems with this is the way parameters are
passed to system calls.  One way to do this would be to have
sys_restart branch to the restart_function (requires asm). 
Another way is to just pass a struct pointer (actually the
reg struct) which the restart function could sort out.  For
example for nano_sleep:
int sys_restart(struct void parms)
{
	return (current->restart_block.sys_call) (&parms);
}
Then:
struct nano_sleep_call{
	struct timespec *tp;
	struct timespec *rem;
}
int restart_nano_sleep(struct nano_sleep_call *parm)

And then only when returning -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK.
