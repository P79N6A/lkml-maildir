I went all the way up to 20000 msec and it still didn't help.  I'm sure 
it's a bad idea, but removing that whole if-block below it makes it work 
(which is effectively what switching the and/or did).  I don't know enough 
about it to judge whether it's correct, but what exactly is it checking for 
there?
