Another one for prior art. As I thought about it
I remember "inventing" the same sort of wrap around
algorithm in 1980-81 for a proprietary real time
OS on a network of microprocessors.
Same basic idea, but instead of centuries I had
to worry about the fairly small word size wrapping
around on my event counter register for events that
looked at event clock deltas. So guess what? I
did a windowing algorithm... although I just thought
of it as a trick with mod N arithmetic :-)
