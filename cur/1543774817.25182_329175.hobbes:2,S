I guess that CKRM was used so much that it is acceptable. But I still
liked beancounter as a better name :-) [it was similar project, IIRC].

rcfs would be reasonable; unfortunately we already have those /etc/rc*
directories, and rcfs may confuse people into thinking it does
something with system startup. resourcefs?
RBCE/CRBCE are really bad. SimpleClassifier / CustomClassifier?
