I'm running the 2.6.3-full patch on my workstation now. No tuning applied
at all. I reniced the X server to -10. When I have two kernel compiles (without any -j*) 
running there is  a visible (=not really slow, but long enough to notice something) 
delay in responses while typing something in a xterm. In sylpheed there
is the same issue.
The standard scheduler didn't show this that extreme with only two compiles.
