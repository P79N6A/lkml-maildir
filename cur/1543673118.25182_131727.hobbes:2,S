You need to fix lilo to not assume the names listet in /proc/partitions are
actual device files.  In 2.5.69 there's a bug that it prints truncated devfs
names instead of traditional device names as it should, but relying on the
names to mean anything is broken - that kernel can't enforce the device names
used.
The following patch that is in Linus BK tree should get it working for you
again for now..
