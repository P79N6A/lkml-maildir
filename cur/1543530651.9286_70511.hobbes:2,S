The objects in the tree are fully ordered by their keys.  The packing locality
is the first component of the key.  The bitmap.c algorithms, when assigning
blocks to nodes of the tree, put new nodes in the first free block after the
block holding the left neighbor in this tree ordering of the new node.

I leave the below for Alexei and Vladimir to answer in detail.  Generally
speaking, we can only do clean effective SMP after implementing per buffer
seals.  I see that as unlikely to make it into 2.4 due to it requiring a per
buffer/page fs specific struct, but it is actively being coded by Zarochentcev
and Roma.  If 2.4 is slow enough in coming out, maybe we will submit it just in
case Linus will take it.  Our SMP will be poor until we have it.
