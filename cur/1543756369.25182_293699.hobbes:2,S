In fact there is a module in ELSA but it's just to keep a trace of the processes
hierarchy in order to do processes group management and process group
accounting in user space.
The process group management is done by a user space daemon and the process
group accounting is done by a user space application that computes information
provided by BSD-per process accounting and/or CSA accounting with information
provided by the user space daemon.
Thus currently there is a module that relays information about forks but I'm
working on a kobject_uevent solution to send the fork event (thanks to Andrew
for the suggestion).
Thus, I will be interesting to see CSA module in the kernel.

Guillaume
