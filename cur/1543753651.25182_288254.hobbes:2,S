Thanks for reviewing and asking.
Generally, it need not be a valid address to be listed in shortlog.
OTOH, we only _need_ it listed if it was used as ($BK_USER,$BK_HOST)
tuple. I have no hints this was the case and will remove the address for
the next release.

I also reviewed an inquiry about kaos:sgi.o, which I
found used as typoed BK_USER/BK_HOST commit author
<
http://kambing.ui.edu/kernel-linux/v2.6/snapshots/old/patch-2.6.7-rc2-bk7.log>
- and that address I cannot remove as it would result in the typoed
address appearing in the logs rather than author's name.
Should, some day, Signed-off-by have precedence over the changeset
author, we might reconsider this.
I have committed the change to
bk://krusty.dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de/BK-kernel-tools already.
