Are you _sure_ this is an oops, and not just a kernel warning?
Can you provide the whole message that the kernel spit out?
And if this is not for a driver that is in the kernel tree, it's a bit
hard for us to help you out here, try asking the authors of the driver
itself, as that is the code that is causing problems here.
good luck,
