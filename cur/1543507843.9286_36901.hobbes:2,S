Ok, I backed out HJ's user-space lockd patch.  Problem continues.  The
first time anything tries to lock a file on the server, lockd (as a
kernel thread this time) ooopses and becomes zombie.
I'm still fighting with getting a reasonable oops trace.  Keith Owens told
me to use '-x' with klogd, but this suppresses everything but the initial
announcement!
I'll patch klogd next and keep working on it.
