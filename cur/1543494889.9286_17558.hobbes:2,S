I know.  This is a property of the NFS protocol itself, not just of the
implementation: you *must* have fixed-length file handles which persist
over reboot or you break the protocol.  Sure, using iget() is ugly, but
it's not as if we have much choice here if we want to talk to anybody
else's NFS client stack.
