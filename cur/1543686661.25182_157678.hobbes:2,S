That depends entirely on the algorithm used, and that's where my patches 
differ from the main kernel tree. In the main kernel tree, you need to 
accumulate about one second worth of sleep before being elevated one priority 
(woefully long), and use up one second before dropping. Mine is non linear so 
it's not a simple relationship.
