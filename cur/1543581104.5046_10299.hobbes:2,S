	Just an extra data point here.
	I have an A7V here also and I haven't seen anything wrong with
	my setup (but I'm using 2.2.18 + the IDE patches). Perhaps,
	I'm not hitting the bad cases or I'm not stressing the system
	enough. I'm using a Quantum lct15 drive here with UDMA/66
	here.  I have a Duron 600MHz and I remember that when I was
	setting the machine (after I bought it), I left everything in
	the default settings (so, the PCI Master Read Caching is
	disabled).

	I also use 1003, but I have not tried anything else (for fear
	of something going wrong when I'm upgrading -- like a power
	outage). :-)
