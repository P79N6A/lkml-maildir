I saw Space.o being build, and seeing as it is Capitalised thought I would see 
why, and maybe a patch to make it all lower case.
The patch is trivial:

+++ drivers/net/Makefile        2006-05-29 17:59:23.000000000 +0100

then/and rename drivers/net/Space.c -> drivers/net/space.c
It all builds OK (not booted with it though).
Doing a grep of source after changes reveals only a few documentation/comments 
refer to Space.c - no other code.
I have looked though docs and googled as to why this One File Is Like This to 
no avail?  Convention?
