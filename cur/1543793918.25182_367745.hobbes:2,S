Well, userland swsusp has pretty low impact on kernel code -- it adds
something like 150 lines:
 drivers/char/mem.c      |   42 +
 include/linux/suspend.h |   23
 kernel/power/console.c  |    1
 kernel/power/disk.c     |   19
 kernel/power/swsusp.c   |   78 +
 usr/swsusp-init         |    9

i don't think you can do much better than that...

Are you willing to merge the code without BUG_ONs?

Yes, hopefully users will not notice.

Okay, it may have gotten better. Anyway, this is the only part that
really needs to be in-kernel. Saving 50% of memory is still going to
produce *way* more responsive system than "save as little as
possible", and I hope it will be good enough.
