Or more accurately: "we're using a non-free piece of software
because none of the free software fanatics have gotten away
from their flame^Wmail reader for a moment to create a suitable
piece of free software."

piece of software and you want to change the situation, the only
thing you need to do is write a suitable replacement that is free.
