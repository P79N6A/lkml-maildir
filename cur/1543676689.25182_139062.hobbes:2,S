What about mtrr's? They seem like system-level devices to me. Still
its usefull to have kmalloc in its suspend routine, which moves it to
SAVE_STATE phase.
Decision on which level to put it is up to programmer, and it seems
wrong to hardcode it into architecture. It may be more convient to do
save stating at place where you still can kmalloc...
