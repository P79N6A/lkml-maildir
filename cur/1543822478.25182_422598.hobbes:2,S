Yes.  In our tree, we have a config option which completely removes
all the hardware idt table code (X86_NO_IDT) and stores the trap
table as a table suitable to pass directly to the hypervisor.
That's not so useful if you want to build a kernel which can run
both on a hypervisor and on native.  I guess you would need to
disable the X86_F00F_BUG code at runtime in such a kernel.
For the non-runtime case, I wonder if it's preferable to disable
X86_F00F_BUG like you suggest or if it would be better to disable
the cpu types listed?
