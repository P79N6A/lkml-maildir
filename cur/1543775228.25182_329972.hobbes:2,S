Hi,
I hereby throw myself into the neverending flames called "reiser4
plugins" - may it please the gods.
David Masover (who really could use pgp mime attatchments):

Wee, I've seen this before. Wait, its AVFS! But didn't AFVS work with
any underlying fs? Even nfs?
cd foo.zip#/bar/
cat foo.tgz#/bar/plonk.txt
There is no reason why there shouldn't be a gpg AVFS-plugin, too. OK,
AVFS worked via coda's redir.o and IMHO we need smth like this in 2.6.
But, apart from more efficient compression on disk (if that really
ever works) you didn't show any convincing use cases.
Or am I fundamentally wrong?
regards,
  Thomas
