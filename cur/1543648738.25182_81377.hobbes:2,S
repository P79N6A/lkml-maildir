If you would, how would you call the analogous function for 64 bit values?
And the type it returns?
The patches to make the kernel interfaces use the 64 bit jiffies value sit 
in Davej's tree since around 2.5.20-dj3, just waiting for the answer to 
these questions.
jiffies_64_to_clock_t_64() seems a bit lengthy. My current personal 
favourite would be jiffies_64_to_user_HZ(), just returning an u64, so that 
we don't keep on inventing silly types that get used just a very few 
times.
Just my 0.02 euro, though.
