Hi,
I'm about six months late here(!), but I noticed this bug in
arch/x86_64/kernel/smp.c while preparing another related
patch today and then found this thread during Googling ...

You're absolutely right, and this bug still exists in the latest -git.

Actually, I agree with David and Andi here:

Replacing the _bh variants and making smp_call_function{_single}
illegal from all contexts but process is fine for x86_64, as we
don't really have any driver that needs to use this from softirq
context in the x86_64 tree. This means it becomes dissimilar to
s390, but similar to powerpc, mips, alpha, sparc64 semantics.
I'll prepare and submit a patch for the same, shortly.
As for:

I don't see any CPU hotplug / preemption disabling issues here.
Note that both smp_call_function() and smp_call_function_single()
on x86_64 acquire the call_lock spinlock before using cpu_online_map
via num_online_cpus(). And spin_lock() does preempt_disable() on both
SMP and !SMP, so we're safe. [ But we're not explicitly disabling
preemption and depending on spin_lock() instead, so a comment would
be in order? ]
