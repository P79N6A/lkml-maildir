That's simply not true.
- IRQ happens
- kernel handler runs and masks the chip irq, which removes the IRQ
request
- user space message get queued or waiting reader woken
- kernel handler returns IRQ_HANDLED, which reenables the irq in the PIC
- user space handles the device
- user space reenables the device irq
No need for an ioctl. Neither for edge nor for level irqs.
