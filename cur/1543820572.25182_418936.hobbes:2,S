Hi Mark,
This small patch will need some cleaning up:
1.  Signed-off-by: Mark Gross <mark.gross@intel.com>
2.  Try not to use attachments.  If you must, then make the attachment
	type be text instead of octet-stream.
3.  No need to init to 0:
+static int force_function_unhide = 0;
4.  Typos:
+	/* check to see if device 0 function 1 is enbaled if it isn't we
                                                  enabled; it it isn't, we
+	 * assume the BIOS has reserved it for a reason and is expecting
+	 * exclusive access, we take care to not violate that assumption and
                                          not to violate
+	 * fail the probe. */
5.  indentation, typos, and at least one trailing space:
+	if (!force_function_unhide && !(stat8 & (1 << 5))) {
+		printk(KERN_INFO "contact your bios vendor to see if the " 
                                  Contact your BIOS
+		"E752x error registers can be safely un-hidden\n");
		^indent one more tab
