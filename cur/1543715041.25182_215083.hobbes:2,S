They're wrong. First the system call or exception can
block and then when kernel code returns to user space
it always checks if the time slice hasn't expired.

That's also incorrect. e.g. it can generate GPFs
(e.g. when trying to load a segment register supplied
by the user and it is not correct)
and a few other exceptions in extreme cases. Usually
these exceptions are handled without sleeping though.
