No need to say that if only my english where better I couldn't express
it
better by myself.

OK Linus if you give the blessing I will spend much more
ime on making this somehow more smooth. The separation idea 
is something certainly worth a second tought.  Maybe one could 
provide a real clean abstraction for the free list mechanism used 
all around the kernel thus helping reducing code duplication. 
I hope I have already shown by practice that optimizing is 
something I appreciate doing
(remember the complete CD-ROM driver in just about two pages :-).
I have already some ideas about how to first gather real allocator
behaviour from the kernel, and how to move the developement of the slab
code into user space with easy proper bechmarking, based on this *real* 
data, using all the usual user space tools to tweak it to no end...
However since I'm already proffesional at coding, I wouldn't like
to spend serious time on this without knowing first, that the results
will have some real chances to be actually used.
