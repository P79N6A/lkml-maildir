Nope, that just makes the race window smaller. We should check for i_size
after we've gotten the page table lock and just before actually entering
the page into the page tables. Otherwise we'll still race on SMP (a _very_
hard window to get into, admittedly).

It's for ptrace. You can do ugly things with ptrace that aren't possible
for the process itself.

So how about this truncate_complete_page() implementation:
	/*
	 * Try to get rid of a page.. Clear it if it fails
	 * for some reason. The page must be locked upon calling
	 * this function.
	 *
	 * We remove the page from the page cache _after_ we have
	 * destroyed all buffer-cache references to it. Otherwise some
	 * other process might think this inode page is not in the
	 * page cache and creates a buffer-cache alias to it causing
	 * all sorts of fun problems ...
	 */
	static inline void truncate_complete_page(struct page *page)
	{
	        /* Try to get rid of buffers */
	        if (page->buffers)
	                block_flushpage(page, 0);
	
	        spin_lock(&pagecache_lock);
	        spin_lock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
	
	        if (page_count(page) != 1) {
	                memclear_highpage_flush(page, 0, PAGE_CACHE_SIZE);
	        } else {
	                ClearPageDirty(page);
	                __lru_cache_del(page);
	                __remove_inode_page(page);
	                page_cache_release(page);
	        }
	        spin_unlock(&pagemap_lru_lock);
	        spin_unlock(&pagecache_lock);
	}
we should probably special-case the "block_flushpage()" failed case, but
the above should do reasonable things with it (because page_count() will
be > 1 due to buffers).
The above is obviously completely and utterly untested. Petr? Willing to
give this a go?
