Given that we did that back in the CP/M days (late 70's) on floppy, and
with MFM, RLL and finally SCSI drives in the 70's, I would hope that
current drives use large sectors since the drive now has local cache
and doesn't need a fancy driver to do the caching!

Given that the IRG is fixed size regardless of sector size, I certainly
hope I misread what you say or you are incorrect. The difference
between 512B and 4KB sectors should be about 20-40% added capacity per
track (seven IRG sizes). I would expect large sectors would be
standard.
We used to diddle interleave when formatting as well, until we put full
track caching in the device driver.
