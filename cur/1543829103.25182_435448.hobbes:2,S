Hi, thanks for your positive test on "my" theory.
Here it goes the link that I talked about on last email 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/18/92
 (you can read the previous messages on
this thread) 
The patch of this link doesn't compile (at least for me), but have a
simple idea, which is just quirk the VIA_PCIs if they are in XT_PIC mode
and I think that is the way of this quirks should go.
So someone help me out and do a patch that recognize if the interrupt is
in XT-PIC mode or not ? 
Thanks,
