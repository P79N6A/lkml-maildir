Cool, looks pretty nice.

Actually that would be Vojtech Pavlik <vojtech@suse.cz> - input system
maintainer.

We prefer keeping changelogs in SCM, when possible

And I don't think we should add comments like these - they don't tell
you anything new. Especially when they wrong (dev is not a pointer
[yet])

This is not a book, what one could have done but decided not to is not
very interesting unless the solution is outlined as a future TODO
item.

Yes, that is what that "if" statement said. Why also comment it?

This one is a decent comment tough (IMHO).

??? input_sync signals that the input event packet is complete. What
is it about queueing another read stuff?
