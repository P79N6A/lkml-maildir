Wouldn't this :
if ((in_atomic() || irqs_disabled()) && system_running)
be slightly more efficient?   The reason I say that is that I would assume
that the chance of (in_atomic() || irqs_disabled()) being false is greater
than the chance of !system_running - if that is so, then reordering the if
will allow it to break out early more often...
Is that a completely rediculous thing to do?
