Subject: [PATCH 2.5.68 1/2] i_size atomic access
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/4/24/392

This adds a sequence counter only version of the reader/writer
consistent mechanism to seqlock.h  This is used in the second
part of this patch give atomic access to i_size.
re-diff against 2.5.68.
The patch is also available for download from OSDL's patch lifecycle 
manager (PLM):
