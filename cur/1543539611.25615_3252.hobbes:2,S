Subject: sound-service-0-2 no loger MIDI device?

According to Documentation/sound/Introduction sound-service-0-2 will be
requested as the midi device. Has this changed? I have to use
alias sound-service-0-1 awe_wave
for midi to work with my AWE32 card. Using sound-service-0-2 fails.
This is with 2.4.x kernels.
