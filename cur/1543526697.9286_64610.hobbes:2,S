Hi all,
I just tried to make a patch based on packet-0.0.1j for linux-2.3.47pre7.
For the most part, things were very easy, and only a few parts had to be
manually applied (the only part that I couldn't figure out was the sparc32
compatibility bit - looks like DaveM did a sparc merge).  I think that the
patch to sr.c for 2.3.46 has a bug, though.  The following bit seems wrong
in sr.c:

 	switch (SCpnt->request.cmd) {
-	case WRITE:
+	case WRITE_PACKET:
+		printk("sr: got WRITE_PACKET\n");
+		SCpnt->cmnd[0] = WRITE_10;
+		break;
+	case WRITE: {
+		printk("sr: got WRITE\n");
 		if (!scsi_CDs[dev].device->writeable) {
 			return 0;
 		}
 		SCpnt->cmnd[0] = WRITE_10;
-		break;
+	}
 	case READ:
 		SCpnt->cmnd[0] = READ_10;
 		break;
I don't see why you need the braces after 'case WRITE:', but that's a bit
smaller than the problem of not having a 'break' at the end of 'case
WRITE:'
Comments?  I haven't compiled the kernel yet, so I'll see what happens.
Thanks for working on packet-writing, Jens.
