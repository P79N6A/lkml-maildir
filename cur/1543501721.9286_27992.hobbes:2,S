IMHO, if people are submitting bug reports using ksymoops then
they show know how to read raw data off a floppy.  ksymoops could
be enhanced to read the oops data off a floppy.  Your patch could
write the magic bytes before the oops so that the floppy does not
have to be re-intialized.  I don't see the value in writing to a
FAT filesystem.  Simple is good.
