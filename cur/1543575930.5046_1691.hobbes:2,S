I suspect the VM, it's been doing strange things since -test11, -test10 was
working fine. There was heavy fork operation going on (about 50 processes).
Today got also 3-order allocation failures, probably from IDE driver or SCSI
cdrom because cdda2wav triggered them. It happens every time when I start
cdda2wav (with -B option). CDRW drive is only IDE device in the system,
harddisks are SCSI.
