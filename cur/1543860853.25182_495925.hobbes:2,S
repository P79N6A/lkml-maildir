No it doesn't.  It has to on some (very common, heh) subarchs.

When I ported the PowerPC kernel to a new platform years ago,
the big problems happened *before* any of those methods worked,
at really early boot time (the PowerPC port has become a lot
better since then fwiw, it might be easier now).  Running (and
debugging) other client programs was a lot easier, since you
could always drop back to OF on panic conditions so you could
investigate what was going on without using hardware probes.

Oh yes, USB keyboards, lovely.  Use a serial port, or a dedicated
network controller, or similar, for the OF console instead ;-)
