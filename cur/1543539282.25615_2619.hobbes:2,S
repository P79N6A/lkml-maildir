Robert,
This problem does not seem kernel related, are you using the correct GLX
version? There are 2 GLX versions offered on our web site, one specifically
for
X 4.0, and one for X 4.0.1. I suspect you are loading the wrong version (note
the "compiled for:" lines):
(II) Module nvidia: vendor="NVIDIA Corporation" 
        compiled for 4.0.1, module version = 1.0.4 
(II) Module mouse: vendor="The XFree86 Project" 
        compiled for 4.0, module version = 1.0.0 
Terence
