There is nothing better for this purpose.
"hdparm" tries very hard to accurately measure the data transfer rate (DTR)
of a drive:  a very narrow test, agreed, but the DTR is the *only* thing
that the driver can affect (access patterns, seek rates, settling times etc..
are all pretty much constant, regardless of any existing driver changes).
So if you want to measure the effects of driver updates, "hdparm" is the
only meaningful measure.
But if you want to measure overall system performance, which dilutes the
driver component to a tiny fraction, then there are tons of superior tools
(iozone, bonnie, ..).
