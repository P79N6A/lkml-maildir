That's what was confusing me at first.  I was wondering why we needed
a memory controller when we already had one in Linux!  
Also, controlling a resource is more a matter of limits or quotas, not
controls.  Well, I'll actually back off on that, since controls does
have a history in other industries.  
But for computers, limits is an expected and understood term, and for
filesystems it's quotas.  So in this case, I *still* think you should
be using the term "Memory Quota Controller" instead.  It just makes it
clearer to a larger audience what you mean.

Right, CTLR would be more regular shorthand for CONTROLLER.  
Basically, I think you're overloading a commonly used term for your
own uses and when it's exposed to regular users, it will cause
confusion.
