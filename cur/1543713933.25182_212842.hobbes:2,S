The anon_vma head may well be shared with other vmas of the fork group.
But the anon_vma linkage is a list_head and a pointer within the vma.
prio_tree is already using a union as much as it can (and a pointer
where a list_head would simplify the code); Rajesh was thinking of
reusing vm_private_data for one pointer, but I've gone and used it
for nonlinear swapout.

I'm sure an Ingobench will shortly follow that observation.
