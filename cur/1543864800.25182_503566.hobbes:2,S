yes. it is what the 1st patch (AFAIK commited to -mm) from Jeff.

Yes, we saw this happening multiple times already.
e.g. many OpenVZ users run 32bit VEs on 64bit host OS.
due to this bug some apps (e.g. postfix) complain about EOVERFLOW returned by stat()
and fail to work.
I also observed similar bug on Debian 3.0 which has 'find' compiled w/o FILE_OFFSETS=64,
but NFS partition used 64bit inode numbers.
Thanks,
Kirill
