   PCI was intended to be implemented as a LOCAL BUS with all agents on the
   LOCAL BUS being able to talk with any other agent using a flat addressing
   scheme. Your PCI thing does not look like true PCI to me, but rather like
   some bad mutant that has every chance not to survive a long time.
Intentions are neither here nor there.  PCI is MORE USEFUL, because
you CAN do things like IOMMU's and treat PCI like a complete seperate
I/O bus world.
