Hi,
I would like to use the ip_vs_conn struct inside my
system call, but I don't know how to associate it to
my pointer. I declared a struct ip_vs_conn pointer,
but I don't how to make it points to the structure
inside the kernel. Does anybody know if there are some
function such as "task_struct *get_current()" to
return this kind of data?
Thanks
