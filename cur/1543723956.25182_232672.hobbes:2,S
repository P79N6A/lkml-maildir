Very nice, Con.  I've been using ck1 and ck3 with pax applied, and
finding performance to be exceptional.  I'll merge current 2.6.7-pax
with this and test it out right away.
When do you think the staircase, batch, and isometric scheduling will
reach mainline-quality?  Do you think you'll be ready to ask Andrew to
merge it soon, or will it be a while before it's quite ready for that?
How about autoregulated swappiness, which seems to be very efficient at
its job?
