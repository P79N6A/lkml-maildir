For the filemap VMAs (i.e. ones that are based on address_space with
backstore) it is the same thing. For something like tmpfs you have
different VMA-level semantics. Ergo, different VMA methods. They can
be shared with filemap ones, but you definitely don't want ->vm_ops->sync().
End of the problem...
