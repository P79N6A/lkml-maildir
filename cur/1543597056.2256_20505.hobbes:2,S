If your driver is in the kernel,
then you dont need that. All processes
use system-calls (or ioctls) to send
messages and when they do recv(),
they get a pointer to a location
(where they are mapped to via mmap)
and they can read directly. In this
scheme, you dont need any traditional
UNIX IPC mechanism to work.
Thanks,
Rajeev
