I'm not sure we want to have purely sample code in util-linux, but rather
extended sample code that makes some use.  So if you're writing user space
sample code for your new feature make sure it's somewhat production quality,
has a useful interface and write a little manpage for it.  That'll also help
us to win sysdamins hearts back because BSD and solaris already have all these
neat little tools that need to be hacked from scratch in perl on Linux.
For kernel code a samples dir might make sense because say a demo of the
firmware loader (one of those things in Documentation/ right now) of
course never can be "real" code.  OTOH a fork probe as provided with the
tracing code sounds more like a real thing that should go into drivers/misc/.
