It has already been done using 2.6.12-rc2/x86 + RT-V0.7.44-03 a few 
weeks ago. Since it was the first time such merge was attempted, it took 
me a week to get a functional patch which could run a complex "client" 
OS such as RTAI over it. Now that the infrastructure is in place, I 
guess that the task should be simpler, since hopefully, I now better 
understand the implications of having PREEMPT_RT into the kernel codebase.
