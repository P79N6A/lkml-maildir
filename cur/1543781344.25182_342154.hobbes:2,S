Why can't you just implement the system management actions in the kernel
driver?  This is tantamount to a binary SMI hook to userspace.  What
functionality does this provide on a dell system from an administrator's
point of view?

How is this different from shutdown() or reboot()?  What exactly is  
smi_type used
for?  Please provide better documentation on how to use this and what  
it does.
If this is supposed to be used with the RBU code to trigger a BIOS  
update, then
why not integrate it into one kernel driver that receives firmware,  
loads it into
the BIOS, and properly resets the machine at powerdown?  I think  
PowerPC does a
similar thing with OpenFirmware flash memory.  When I change the  
default boot
device or other firmware environment, I get a message from the kernel  
upon
shutdown:
Erasing <BRAND> flash bank 1...
Writing <BRAND> flash bank 1...
Would not a similar system work for Dell?  It would be far simpler to  
use than
the current mess of patches you've proposed.  If done properly, I  
could even
do this:
cat firmware-with-checksum.img >/sys/devices/platform/dellbios/ 
firmware_upgrade
Then an ordinary system reboot or shutdown would automatically use  
the SMI and
host-control-action to upgrade the firmware and shutdown or reboot,  
instead of
the normal ACPI shutdown and reboot code.
