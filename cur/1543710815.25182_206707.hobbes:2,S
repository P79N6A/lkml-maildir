Hello,
while looking around for a way to make the multimedia keys on my Dell 
Inspiron notebook work (in console and/or X), I came across an oldish 
(4 months) post here
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/11/10/188
with a patch to fix the problem. I can of course apply the patch to 
my own kernel, but is there a particular reason why it wouldn't get 
into mainstream?
