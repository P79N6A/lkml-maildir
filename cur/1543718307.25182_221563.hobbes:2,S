No, that doesn't work.  Look:
reread:
	...
        if (ext2_find_goal(inode, iblock, chain, partial, &goal) < 0)
                goto changed;
changed:
        while (partial > chain) {
                brelse(partial->bh);
                partial--;
        }
        goto reread;
So it's spaghetti code that can modify goal.  Yuck.
5 labels in one function?  3 backwards jumps?  Disgusting.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
