Hi!
I found a problem booting with lilo 22.1, linux-2.2.20 and
initrd on a machine with more than 1GB of physical memory!
The kernel is configured with CONFIG_2GB set and lilo is
called with the following parameters in /etc/lilo.conf:
[...]
boot = /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/disc
install = /boot/boot.b
timeout = 100
verbose = 1
prompt
read-only
lba32
image = /boot/vmlinuz
  label = linux
  root = /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3
  initrd = /boot/initrd.gz
  append = "apm=power-off"
  vga = 1
[...]
With this setting, the system boots fine if I have 1GB - epsilon
of RAM installed.
As soon as I put more than 1GB of physical memory into
the machine (for example: 1.5GB), the kernel itself recognizes
the correct amount of memory, but tells me at boot time:
[...]
initrd overwritten (0x80f30000 < 0x8115af08) - disabling it
[...]
It boots fine, if I boot it with "linux mem=960M"...
I tried the same kernel and initrd image with the syslinux
bootloader (version 1.65), and here linux boots fine even
with 1.5GB RAM installed.
I've put a printk statement into init/main.c to get the 
initrd_start address in this case, and it says:
[...]
start_kernel: initrd_start = 0xb7f30000
[...]
I then called lilo again on the 1.5GB system booted with
syslinux, but this didn't help: initrd was still loaded
at address 0x80f30000 and thus got overwritten at boot time...
This behaviour is reproducable on a different system, too.
To me it looks like lilo get's the initrd start address
wrong if there is more than 1GB of RAM in the system.
I haven't found anything in the lilo documentation how to 
solve this problem. 
Is this a lilo or a user bug?
Any idea, anyone?
- andreas
