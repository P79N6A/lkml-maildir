Sounds more like 1/2 maxi to me, but you are basically right. 2-3k on
one of my production embedded kernels. I can accept that, but it
doesn't really make me happy.

Still on my list, but I didn't get to it yet.

Do you have a .config for that kernel. I tried to create a maximal one
for 2.5.69 as well, but the problems in the Subject: stopped me and ld
didn't give me enough clues, which drivers to remove.
