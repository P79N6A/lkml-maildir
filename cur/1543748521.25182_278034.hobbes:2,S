I just successfully made a data DVD using 2.6.9 and growisofs.   So I 
know that the lockups I had experienced were either a fluke or due
to problems with cdrecord. 
I think you are right, that growisofs calls mkosifs which cannot make 
audio CD's.  So at least I know this is not a driver issue.  Most likely 
the
problems I have been having were due to cdrecord.
