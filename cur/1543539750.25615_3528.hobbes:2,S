Not true. The warranty will be invalidated only after these
vendor-specific commands are USED. Otherwise you'd get your warranty
void just by running the drive under DOS/W9x, because they offer no
protection at all.
These commands are firmware update, lowlevel format, get/set sector
remapping and this stuff, and they're *very* useful - actually I revived
a bunch of WD drives this way ... they were already too old for a WD
serviceman to do this for free.

Not possible, really.
