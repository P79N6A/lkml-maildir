Subject: [PATCH] libsas: support NCQ for SATA disks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/13/300

This patch adds SATAII NCQ support to libsas.  Both the use_ncq and the
dma_xfer flags in ata_task must be set for NCQ to work correctly on the
Adaptec SAS controller.  The rest of the patch adds ATA_FLAG_NCQ to
sata_port_info and sets up ap->scsi_host so that ata_setup_ncq doesn't
crash.  Please note that this patch is against the aic94xx-sas git tree,
not scsi-misc.  Thanks also to James Bottomley for providing an earlier
version of this patch from which to work.
I've tested this patch on a x206m with a ST380819AS SATA2 disk plugged
into the Adaptec SAS controller.  The drive came up with a queue depth
of 31, and I successfully ran an I/O flood test to coerce libata into
sending multiple commands simultaneously.  A kernel probe recorded the
maximum tag number that had been seen before and after the flood test;
before the test it was 2 and after it was 30, as I expected.
