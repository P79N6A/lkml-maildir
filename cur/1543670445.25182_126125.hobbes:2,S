Years ago I did submit patches of all kinds, mostly 'asm' stuff
because I have been doing assembly for over 20 years. However,
I got tired of being shot-down in flames by persons who haven't
a clue, so I stopped doing that.
The history of the stuff in asm-i386 is full of changes, with
many bugs introduced by persons who tried so save a nanosecond
here and there. In recent times (past two years) somebody changed
the stuff back to things which were not optimum, but quite obviously
correct.
I might 'risk' sending in some patches again. Maybe.

The test for every byte transferred is, quite obviously, correct.
It is also, quite obviously, non optimum.

Unaligned access takes a penalty. On early i586 machines, it was
horrible, doubled the access time. On i486 and, later on i686
machines, the access times are not changed as radically. Many
of the changes, that were later reverted back, to the string
and memory 'asm' routines occurred when the 'awful' i586
came out. Of course, the unaligned access on the i586 was
still faster than the i486 with aligned access (because of
clock speeds). However, it was worth the trouble to improve
the assembly routines at that time.

Yep. Naive code looks so 'simple', must be "optimum", no? ;^).

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
