I'm not quite clear how the settings under /proc/sys/vm/* would effect the 
problem.  I neglected to mention in my previous post that all web content 
is served directly from the memory of the web server (no file 
accesses).  The only file accesses that happen are from a MySQL server 
which gets queried about once a second.
Here's the output of /proc/meminfo.  I'm not sure how helpful it is.  I was 
kinda hoping for something that would allow me to see how much memory had 
been allocated for sockets and what the max was.
[root@s4 /proc]# cat meminfo
