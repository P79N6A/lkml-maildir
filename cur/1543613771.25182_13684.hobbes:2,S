Hello,
Thanks for the reply!

Ah, of course.
I did try this already, but it was before I realised that PROLL was
eating anything I passed to the kernel.
I just modified my little hack to make it hard code: nfs=root ip=auto
and now the IP-Config stuff is happening and it's showing the
bootserver/rootserver right but for some strange reason it's getting the
IP as 67.0.0.0.
It should be 192.168.0.21 and the server config should be right as I can
still boot 2.4.1 fine...
I'll have a check around later, but if there is a reason for this
happening, maybe you could let me know...
Is 67.0.0.0 some sort of default?
Thanks!
Bye for Now,
Ian
