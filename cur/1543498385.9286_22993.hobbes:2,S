I mean that you have to wait until
the player stops to play the music.
Mouse is blocked too. When the
player stops the music, you have the
control of the GUI again.

An NT box reserved to that video game,
that *only* plays that videogame I think
it could use RT for this game, since this
game uses thread that manages theirself.
The problem is that the touchscreen
device driver is blocked by the main
game thread, too. And I feel that in Linux
other processes could be blocked by
one RT process, but not device drivers
directly driven by hardware interrupts.

I agree.
