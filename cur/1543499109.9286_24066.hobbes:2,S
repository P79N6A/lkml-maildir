The problem that <whomever> wrote about is that if you do the "read"
now, the system can attempt to read the data, but there is no
guarantee that it will still be in the buffer cache if you ... finally
... get around to reading it.
We should "solve" this by issueing the "readahead request" once the
unsatisfied "read" happens, and then just count on the application to
be well behaved in that it will read the requested data within
reasonable time again....
Pretty safe assumption if we're doing this for performance reasons. 
If the data drops out of the cache befor ethe application has a chance
to read it, then that's simply too bad, and the request (i.e. read
will have to be issued again.).
