Subject: 2.6.18-rc4-mm2: tickadj removal breaks 6 architectures

ntp-add-time_adjust-to-tick-length.patch removes the tickadj variable 
that is according to grep still used on six architectures (I've seen 
the compile error on m68k and sparc, haven't checked the other four).
Roman, you should also try your patches on exotic architectures
like m68k. ;-)

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
