We don't officially support 64-bit yet, that is why it is disabled in
the Kconfig. The 64-bit parts are preliminaries, and as with 32-bit,
should have no impact when CONFIG_KMEMCHECK=n (as is the case for all
64-bit builds as you pointed out). It is largely untested, but
according to Pekka it at least boots in qemu with kmemcheck enabled
even for 64-bit.
So the 64-bit parts we have is basically to make it _compile_ even if
you force KMEMCHECK=y on a 64-bit build.
(The main obstacle standing in the way of fully supporting 64-bit is
the opcode decoding. I don't really know how the 64-bit registers
works, so I will have to read about it first :-))
Thank you for looking over!
