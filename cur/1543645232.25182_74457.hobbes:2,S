That box is my development/main box, i run a lot of xterms, xmms, network 
applications (ssh, browsers, irc etc...). Heavy simulator usage (i believe 
thats where the poll stuff comes from, due to its virtual ethernet 
interface) all done in X and the box is also local NFS server for the 
various testboxes i have (heavy I/O, disk load) as well as kernel 
compiles.
