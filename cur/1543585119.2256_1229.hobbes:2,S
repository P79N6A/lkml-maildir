The driver for opl3sa2 seems to be broken with 2.4.2. Same configuration with
2.4.1 it loads fine. The obvious thing is that the driver looks to have had some
major rewrite. Other modules load ok, so it's probably not a kernel problem but
something specific to this module.
Anyone else seen this or have a solution ?
