Where you receive a packet from isn't very useful for determining
even the full patch on which that packet itself flowed.
More importantly, packets also do not necessarily go back out over the
same path on which packets are received for a connection.  This is
actually quite common.
Maybe packets for this connection come in via IPoIB but go out via
gigabit ethernet and another route altogether.

I disagree with Linux changing it's behavior.  It would be great to
turn off congestion control completely over local gigabit networks,
but that isn't determinable in any way, so we don't do that.
The IPoIB situation is no different, you can set all the bits you want
in incoming packets, the barrier to doing this remains the same.
It hurts performance if any packet drop occurs because it will require
an extra round trip for recovery to begin to be triggered at the
sender.
The network is a black box, routes to and from a destination are
arbitrary, and so is packet rewriting and reflection, so being able to
say "this all occurs on IPoIB" is simply infeasible.
I don't know how else to say this, we simply cannot special case IPoIB
or any other topology type.
