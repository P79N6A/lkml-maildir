Sure.  
You and Chris and I can find a way to test it.  Those are "toy tests".
The RT-LSM has been used for over a year by hundreds (probably
thousands) of musicians in studios making real music.  That's what I
mean by "real music studios".  We won't be able to do that kind of
testing for the rlimits solution until next year.
