In ANSI/ISO C and C++, "strictly conforming" means basically what you said.
But "conforming" means much less -- a "conforming program" is just a
program that is acceptable to at least one conforming C implementation
somewhere.  Since conforming C implementations are allowed to accept
*anything*, provided they issue a diagnostic, the term "conforming program"
is essentially meaningless.
