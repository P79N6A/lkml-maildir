yes, it doesn't eat the notification (SIGCHLD), but it reaps a
zombie, clears ->exit_code TASK_STOPPED/TASK_TRACED tasks, clears
SIGNAL_STOP_CONTINUED.

I don't see how it is possible to implement this...
The parent can sleep on ->wait_chldexit and it will be notified, but
how can we wait for the unrelated process with the same UID ?
Even if sys_waitfd() uses P_PID, we can't use task->parent->signal->wait_chldexit,
task->parent can exit before task exits.
Or I misunderstood you?
