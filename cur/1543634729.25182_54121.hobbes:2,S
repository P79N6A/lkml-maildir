Thanks, now with your report (and in fact Zwane's one, which cleared the 
fact this bug scenario have been seen before) it's all clear to me. I 
don't subscribe to nor used to read this list archives, so I couldn't 
take a better picture and guess without actually someone pointing this out.
I'll direct the pressure all over nvidia, and in mean time I'll read the 
relevant articles in the archives, which seems the way to avoid  
unnecessary redundancy ...
Sorry folks if I bothered too much, I'll try avoid that :-)
Thanks for all of you,
Alexandre
