And it was not THAT far from true. My 4 years old Courier V.Everything is still
fastest modem for normal telephone line (it was upgraded to 56Kbit, of course,
but it was done with program change, not with any physical changes in it).

They will not be. Of course we'll see some more speedup (may be even 10GHz
but I doubt even it) but not that much. Not much enough to make usage of
64 Itanium deriviation affordable for toaster at least :-)

It fact what should be changed is NOT kernel but glibc. 99.9% of programs do
not call kernel directly. Even if fix for Y2.038K will be added to kernel in
Y2.035K it'll be problem but not such a big problem if all programs will be
ready... So it's more like glibc's problem then kernel problem right now.
