	Drivers for such hardware would allocate their memory with
dma_alloc(...,DMA_CONSISTENT), which is what 99.9% of all current
drivers would do, indicating that the allocation should
fail if consistent memory is unavailable.
	David Gibson was describing a hypothetical platform which
would have both consistent and inconsistent meory but on which the
cache operations were so cheap that he thought it might be more
optimal to give inconsistent memory to those drivers that claimed
to be able to handle it.  (Ignore the question of whether that
really is optimal; let's assume David is right for the sake
of example.)  On such a platform, drivers that did not
claim to be able to handle inconsistent memory would still get
consistent memory (or get NULL).  The optimization that David has
in mind would only be done for drivers that claim to be able to
handle inconsistent memory.

	Nobody is talking about eliminating the mechanism for a
driver to say "fail if you cannot give me consistent memory."
That would be the normal usage.
