Subject: sendfile() ignores SIGPIPE handler?

Hi,
I'm doing an FTP server application (the last problem I had
was solved very well by the list -- thanks), and I've run into
a problem. I use sendfile() to send the packets wherever
possible, and since I don't want my application crashing all
the time, I ignore SIGPIPE. However, if the SIGPIPE occurs
inside sendfile(), it isn't properly ignored. I've tried doing
a sigblock() and adding a real signal handler -- nothing helps.
I'm currently running Linux kernel version 2.2.14 and glibc
2.1.2.
Since I don't follow linux-kernel, I'd appreciate if any
replies were Cc'ed to me.
Thanks,
/* Steinar */
