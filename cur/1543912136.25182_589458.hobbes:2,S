Stoooooopp!
This patchseries is entirely unacceptable!
one patch per file is the most braindead and most unacceptable way
to split a series.  Please stop whatever you're doing right now and
correct it and send out a patch that has one patch per logical change
for the whole tree.  This means people can actually read the patch,
and it's bisectable.
