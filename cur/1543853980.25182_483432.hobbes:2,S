Ah, hm. Interesting. Maybe it does want OS support, then. Have you tried 
it in the Leading Brand OS?

You possibly don't want to do that if there's a mounted bay device in 
the dock.
We really need to determine some sort of policy when it comes to mounted

mount point), or do we prevent users from shooting themselves in the 
foot?
