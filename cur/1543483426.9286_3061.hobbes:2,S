What I meant was that these VFS: disk change reported type messages happen any
time I do a `cdcd eject` with the drive, as opposed to only when there was a
hardware failure. Here's the tail of my dmesg:
registered device ppp0
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x40
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Hardware error -- (Sense key=0x04)
  (vendor-specific error) -- (asc=0xb6, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Start Stop Unit" packet command was: 
  "1b 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 "
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)
PPP Deflate Compression module registered
Those VFS messages are just from me popping cd's in and out using cdcd.
