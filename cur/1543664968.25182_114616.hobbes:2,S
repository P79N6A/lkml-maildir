Subject: 2.5.64 - cpufreq/userspace compile failure (with patch)

The kernel failed to compile with the cpufreq userspace option being
set. I looked at the code a bit and figured the following patch would
solve it. Haven't tested the kernel yet though.

The problem was that intf was not a member of the cpyfreq_policy struct
(or any other struct in any related .h files that I could see)
