We don't *want* you to look bad, but when you insist on posting
conspiracy theory crap like the above, you bring it on yourself.
FYI, Fedora aggressively tracks mainline. So any of 'your' bugfixes
sent into the official kernel get picked up usually within a day.
RHEL being somewhat more conservative, doesn't, (and reiserfs
is unsupported there anyway).
The *only* times we _refuse_ to apply bugfixes are when said bugfixes
cause more problems than they are alleged to fix, or when those
fixes aren't relevant for some reason, but don't let facts get in
the way of a good rant.
