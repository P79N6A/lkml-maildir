Normal run of things there is many times 1-3 'make -j6s' running.
Yes, sure, for on of them you prob should use -j4, but hey its
in the head, right =).  No, it is not kernels, it is a variety
of stuff - goes with the distro i guess.  Yes, I have tested
runs of 'make -j12' and 'make -j24' (sorry, should have been more
precise, but -j{6,12,24) was used as testing, with -j6 default)
running dual makes.
With vanilla the mouse pointer, XMMS, switching desktops or
windows is smooth.  If I really hammer the system, it does
'slow down' the general navigation of X a little, but not
so that that mouse pointer is jerky, etc.  With the O??int
patches things starts to 'stutter' under loads that is fairly
under those that vanilla handles fine.  The mouse gets jerky,
switching desktops is notably lagging.
Note that I am not talking about starving XMMS/the make's.
I am just talking general navigation of X.  Yes, even with
vanilla things do start a bit slower, but the mouse goes
where it should, and its not as if the vga struggles to
redraw the screen on desktop switch.  I do not expect the
system to behave for 'interactive' processes and xmms/whatever
as if there is no load - the signs of load is just way more
than with vanilla.
