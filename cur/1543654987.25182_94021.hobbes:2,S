The way the system is now a system call "appears" to get by
value calls, but the parameters are on the stack (in the
regs structure).  This is what is restored and passed back
on a system call restart.  What I am getting at is that
nano_sleep could scribble anything it wants here and
"notice" it on the recall.  A new call would not have these
values.  So, all that needs to really happen in the arch
code is to set up the restart address (or, maybe the system
call number).  But then, if this is what we do, do we even
need a new call?
But now you are going to tell me that other archs don't pass
parameters to system calls in this way, right?
Changing the call to absolute changes the semantics (in
particular the behavior on clock setting) in a way I don't
think you want to.  I.e. you can tell it was done.  So you
would have to do this in a way that does not look like the
absolute call in the current POSIX spec.
