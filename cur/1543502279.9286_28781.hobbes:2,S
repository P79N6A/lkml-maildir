We're aiming for something better than Windows.
Unix has traditionally had a more powerful and useful command line
than Windows -- and people use it a lot more.

GUI users _do_ use the command line.
That is my religous stance of the day.
I'm a fscking GUI user -- I use netscape, gv, Lyx and gimp extensively,
and I also use the command line a lot.  And the apps I use make
_extensive_ use of command line apps.
e.g. When clicking on "Gimp->File->Email image" works by invoking
     "cat image | sendmail -options '<address>'" I expect it to just work.
This is the argument for presenting the same filesystem to all apps.

???  Are you saying GUI apps should never invoke existing command line apps?
     Or that all command line apps should be changed?

The shell has nothing to do with command line apps seeing the right
files.  It may be able to do completion and wildcards on albods, but
then how does it sensibly invoke apps?

Because "hidden" is by definition a shell-only, GUI-only thing.
It doesn't affect the behaviour of command-line apps.
But if I invoke "zcat some_file_that_only_exists_in_GUI.gz", you're
suggesting it should fail?

Because they're interconnected.  GUI apps often invoke non-GUI apps and
vice versa.  People use the command line because it's powerful and
because you can write decent scripts.  Even GUI scripting is done using
shell scripts.  This is unix, not DOS.
