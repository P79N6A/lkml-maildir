Currently using the latest git version, and it seems like 'dmesg -n
1' (ie 'syslog(0x8, 0, 0x1)') is broken.  IE, kernel messages after
initscripts and 'dmesg -n1' is called goes to console (mostly when newer
udev does its coldplug thing).
If nobody have a hunch what it can be, I'll try to track it later on if
I get time.  It still worked shortly with -git checkouts shortly before
2.6.18-rc1 was release.  Unfortunately I did not have time to test newer
kernels until now.
