That is a result of PFN_UP() in reserve_bootmem_node() for which we hit the 
BUG_ON() eventually.   Prior to calling reserve_bootmem_node() we have...
node_ar.end_pfn = node->node_end_pfn = PFN_DOWN(physbase+reserve_size). 
Hence a PFN_UP() will raise the value of 'end'. The kernel has 
CONFIG_PPC_64K_PAGES enabled in the config.
