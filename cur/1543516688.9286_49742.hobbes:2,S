Howdy!!
  I tried the PIIX tuning option. I can set the options so 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA is not set. In this case 
static int piix_dmaproc(ide_dma_action_t func, ide_drive_t *drive)
calls ide_dmaproc((ide_dma_action_t) piix_config_drive_for_dma(drive), drive);
which is defined in ide-dma.c. This file can only be included in with the 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA option set. I couldn't figure if this fix shoudl go
into the Makefile with it including the extra binary or have it set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA to yes in Config.in.  Just to let you knwo about the
problem. 
P.S
  In driver/video/Config.in 
  tristate '  Cirrus Logic suport (EXPERIMENTAL)' CONFIG_FB_CLGEN
  should be 
  tristate '  Cirrus Logic support (EXPERIMENTAL)' CONFIG_FB_CLGEN
"Testing?  What testing?  If it compiles it's great, if it boots it's
perfect."
