Then not only were you on different hardware, but you weren't even
running the same test he was! He wasn't reporting raw numbers for one
glxgears, he was running several in parallel.
Whether your test is valid is a different question. Regardless, it's
not the same test he was doing, and so your results have no bearing on
his. You may wish to reread his message from the start of the thread,
and find the glitch1 script he was using to perform the test. He's
sent it to the list before as an attachment.
