If they hired someone who did a _proper_ job -- writing a fully portable
and maintainable driver which got merged into Linus' kernel, then this
scenario doesn't make much sense. In-kernel code does generally get
maintained as interfaces change.
Of course, maintaining a driver _outside_ the kernel tree is a
never-ending task -- but why would anybody ever want to do that?
