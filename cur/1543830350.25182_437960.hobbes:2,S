The idea is that sysfs files are named according to their contents, so
you should be able to cat the file to get the value.  The issue, which
is very simple to resolve with your driver, is that all the current
values are preceded by strings, so they have to be parsed to get the
value instead of just being directly read (I think this is a residue of
the fact that it's a straight conversion of a single proc file).
