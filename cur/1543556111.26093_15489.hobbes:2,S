Sure.

Actually, I was not thinking about spinlock. What I missed was the fact
that again: was quite recent. My apologies...

There are two quite distinct patterns: duplicated range vs. crap in metadata.
The former looks like a bug caught by Jens. The latter (especially in
bitmaps) seems to be older[1] and independent from elevator stuff. _That_ may
be a fs/buffer.c or fs/ext2/* bug. The former definitely lives below the
fs/buffer.c level.
[1] "older" may mean "shared with 2.2" here - ISTR bug reports looking like
that and IIRC they were never resolved. BTW, if you know some searchable
l-k archive... DN sucks coprolites through the straw these days ;-/
