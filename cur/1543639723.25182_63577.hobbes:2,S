Any chance this is the cause of the following?

FYI, just got this while un-tarring a kernel tree with 
2.5.31+everything.gz:

That'll be this one:
                BUG_ON(page->pte.chain != NULL);
we've had a few reports of this dribbling in since rmap went in.  But
nothing repeatable enough for it to be hunted down.
But we do have a repeatable inconsistency happening with ntpd and
memory pressure.  That may be related, but in that case it's probably
related to mlock().
So.  An open bug, alas.
