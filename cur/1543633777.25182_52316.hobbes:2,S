static inline int do_follow_link(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)
{   
        int err;
        if (current->link_count >= 5)
                goto loop;
...
        current->link_count++;
...
        err = dentry->d_inode->i_op->follow_link(dentry, nd);
        current->link_count--;
        return err;
loop:
        path_release(nd);
        return -ELOOP;
}
->link_count is modified only by the code above.
INIT_TASK has zero link_count.
new task inherits ->link_count of parent at the moment of do_fork()
It means that:
	* at any moment ->link_count is between 0 and 5
	* at any moment the call chain contains at most 6 instances of
do_follow_link()
	* if there are 6 such instances then the last of them is either the
last element of chain or it is followed by path_release().
	BTW, it shows a potential subtle problem - if we ever call do_fork()
while resolving a symlink (the only way that can happen is kernel_thread()
being called in process of symlink resolution) we will get a kernel thread
with limit for nested symlinks lower than 5.  Proposed fix (both 2.4 and 2.5):
ed kernel/fork.c <<EOF
/swappable/a
        p->link_count = 0;
.

EOF
