Are there any recent kernel profiles?  I think from an acedemic
perspective it'd be nice to see some graphs and numbers nobody
understands showing where the longest running code paths in the kernel
occur.  It might also be nice for those latency whores (*runs to the
back and raises hand*) and those who want to increase overall
performance and efficiency; then there'd be a map showing . . .
something that only kernel hackers could possibly understand or care about.
