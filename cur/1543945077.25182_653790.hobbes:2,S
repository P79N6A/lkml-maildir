Where then could the first byte go?  Note I'm not fussing about flow controls 
per sei, so the subject line maybe needs to be adjusted, but they obviously 
work well enough that a multimegabyte transfer to my printer works very well, 
but about usb trying to entirely replace serial here.  There does seem to be 
a problem but I'm not 100% positive where it is in the chain of a usb packets 
travels.  What I've observed, with hidraw I think it was, is that the 
first 'wake up' byte incoming didn't seem to be there.
