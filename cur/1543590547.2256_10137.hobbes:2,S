I'm working on a problem on alpha SMP on the
AS4100 (Rawhide) machine. Under SMP, with heavy network activity.
With an inbound and outbound ping flood running, after about 500,000
packets, it just dies. Console dead, no response. For about a minute.
Then, sometimes, the machine comes back. 
Anything I can instrument? to help?
Alt-sysrq, though enabled, does not seem to work on these machine's
consoles.
