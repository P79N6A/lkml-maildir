I think that your example for testing is the most valid one.
In development, you normally have different source trees (hardlinked if you 
don't have a terabyte of hard drive space to spare), and use an editor that 
breaks hard-links (eg, emacs). You might as well build in the source 
directory, since you'll likely keep reworking it.
In release testing (aka release engineering, or more accurately: release 
fumbling-in-the-dark), you need to test a few different configurations. Sure, 
you could just build a set of symlink or hardlink trees, but it'd be very 
useful to be able to "make multiconfigs" and have a representative set of 
kernels built (either for later testing, or at least to ensure that the new 
kernel will build without modules, without networking, without IDE, and so 
on). Sure, it will take a while if you build everything, but that is why 
God^WTridge gave us ccache.
