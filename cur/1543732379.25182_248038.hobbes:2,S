So you're saying SCP, CVS, Subversion, Bitkeeper, Apache and rsyncd
will _all_ lose part of a Word document when they handle it on a
Window box?
Ouch!
The only sensible implementation I can imagine would be if the OS
linearised multi-stream Word documents into the non-stream format
automatically for all programs which don't know about streams.
Which is of course what I would like to implement for Linux...
