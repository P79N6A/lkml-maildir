It can be set only as root, and I had originally posted it when I first coded
it up.  It was not accepted because it was dangerous and the proper fix was
to eliminate the recursion.
I could repost it, but I think it would likely not be accepted for the same
reason.
By CC to the kernel mailing list:
It should be noted that the defacto "solution" that people have for
this problem is to aribrarily raise the constant from 5 to something higher
than 5 (like 8 or 10 in our case).  This is pretty easy to do now even without
a sysctl because it now only has to be changed in one place, but it does
require a recompile.  Although a sysctl for the ELOOP limit of 5 is dangerous
it is an acceptable workaround in many cases for a problem that is not likely
to be fixed any time soon.
