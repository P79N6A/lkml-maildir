Hmm, this reminds me. This system isn't a SMP machine is it?  SMP has
threads that run at priority 99 to handle things like swapping tasks
from one CPU to another.  These will never show up in the tracer since
they are the highest priority.  But I have seen these threads cause
latencies in some of my own code.
