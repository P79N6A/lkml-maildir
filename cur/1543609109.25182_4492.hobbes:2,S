Hi,
I have released version 1.4 of my package with a new kernel module and
some enhancements to the i8kmon utility.
It should now work on more Dell laptops (Inspiron and Latitude) and report
correctly the bios version and machine id. If it doesn't load try forcing
it with:
    insmod ./i8k.o force=1
Please test the new version and send me a report. Don't forget to include
the following information:
    laptop model
    bios version
    driver version
    i8kmon version
    kernel messages while loading the driver
    output of "cat /proc/i8k"
and a detailed description of any problem you have found.
