You can use the device ids to provide stable symlinks, then /etc/fstab 
shouldn't be a problem. Or you rewrite mount to support it. Or you do it in 
the kernel with a user-space helper: when a new device is connected its ID is 
sent to some user-space app, and the user-space app then assigns a minor 
number and devfs name to the node.
IMHO using the path of a file in /dev to identify a device node does not work 
in a hotplugging environment. You need this to support existing apps, but the 
only way to be sure that you always get the same device is to use device IDs. 
You could encode that device id in the node's path or use the path as a 
moniker for the device id (the symlink solution does this), but you need to 
have more information about the device than it's minor number (the X in 
/dev/lpX).

Ok, but I think no one doubts that it is a bad idea to assign ethX 
semi-randomly. Basically this is the same problem as with device files, only 
in a different namespace.

The device registry (www.tjansen.de/devreg) patches devfs to allow the things 
described above though.
