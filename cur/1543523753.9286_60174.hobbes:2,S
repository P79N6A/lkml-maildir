you'd like to think so, wouldn't you.
i recall seeing an argument about this in the gcc/egcs list (about a
year ago) wrt g77 but i think it applied to all the gcc family of
compilers.  fp register spills go into a 64 bit memory location.  yes,
this loses precision.  yes, this spill and subsequent loss of
precision is dependent upon the surrounding code, optimization level,
phase of the moon and is therefore hard to predict by the programmer.
besides, the x86 sucks at reading/storing 80 bit quantities.  they are
hard to align and not waste space &c.  welcome to the world of intel
architechure.
