To reserve a syscall there needs to be some users and some eventual hope
of merging.  The idea, btw, means anyone can specify the value in the
binary, so it could just as easily be done via prctl or something
similar that makes the out of tree patch easier to maintain.  Although,
I don't actually see the value with the description above.

ENOSYS error.
