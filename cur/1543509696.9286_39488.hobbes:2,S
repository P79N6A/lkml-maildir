That isn't finalised.  I _might_ make the ext3 journal use a reserved
inode, but right now there isn't actually a difference between ext2 and
ext3.  You just create a journal file on the ext2 filesystem and tell
the kernel where to find it.  Then when you mount it as ext3, everything
is automatically journaled to that file.
If you uncleanly shutdown, then the ext3 filesystem will have a
compatibility flag set in the superblock to prevent you from remounting
it as ext2 without doing a recovery step first.  Once that is done, it
becomes mountable as ext2 again.
