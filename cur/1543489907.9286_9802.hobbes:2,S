Just installed the pathes for this today, from 2.2.0.
2 problems seem to be strking me immediately.
1) My PPP connection, while stays connected, seems unusable.
the 'route' program hangs, and returns nothing, can't get to any external
hosts.  Shutting off PPP doesn't fix it, requires a reboot.
(where the second problem was noticed)
2) After rebooting, my box hangs at:
pty: 256 Unix98 ptys configured
After rebooting again everything seems fine. Then PPP dies after a few
hours of use, and I start the cycle again. :)
If anyone has seen these probs, let me know I'm not alone. If Anyone
needs anby more information that I can deliver let me know.
