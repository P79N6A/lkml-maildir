Define people. Some won't download a thing, they will take whatever the 
distros feed them. Some will download and test the latest patchset 
frequently, especially if someone asks. Some are interested only in a 
particular subsystem or feature.

I believe the solution is slowly working its way out.  Previously there 
were only two stark choices, either you could be stable, safe, and boring, 
or you could use the development series and things could break horribly. I 
believe having a place where things could be tried out, such as the -mm 
kernels, was a great idea.
IMHO the 2.5 development series was long enough to be painful almost to 
the point of being counterproductive.  I think part of the problem with 
development series in general is/was a lack of focus. If the announced 
goal of the 2.5 series had been confined to changing module loading and 
latency/scheduling issues at the beginning, it would have been a lot 
shorter, and better.
I would like to see an even/odd stable/development cycle where the 
development cycle is limited to two or three major ideas and APIs don't 
change in stable cycles. New features not likely to cause breakage or new 
driver support could be targeted for the -mm kernels.
