The problem of the current scheduler is that it acts like an infinite feedback
system.
When we're going to decide if we've to move a task we analyze the status at the
current time without taking in account the system status at previous time
values.
But the feedback we send ( IPI to move the task ) take a finite time to hit the
target CPU and, meanwhile, the system status changes.
So we're going to apply a feedback calculated in time T0 to a time Tn, and this
will result in system auto-oscillation that we perceive as tasks bouncing
between CPUs.
This is kind of electronic example but it applies to all feedback systems.
The solution to this problem, given that we can't have a zero feedback delivery
time, is :
1) lower the feedback amount, that means, try to minimize task movements
2) a low pass filter, that means, when we're going to decide the sort ( move )
        of a task, we've to weight the system status with the one that it had
        at previous time values
