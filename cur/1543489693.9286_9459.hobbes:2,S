I have *never* seen this message on Intel-Architecture-32bit (ia32).
And my systems have a *lot* of IDE devices/activity: 
3-5 disks, a cdrom, tape, zip, and PCMCIA ATA cards.. all active simultaneously!
The message is is only there "temporarily" anyway,
just to check for bugs seen (but not understood) on other architecture(s).
