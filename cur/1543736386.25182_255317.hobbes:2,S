OOps, my bad. I thought I've seen it there... Must be my tired eyes playing
tricks on me.

Since I just recently added it (for serio sysfs benefits mostly) I highly
doubt that anyone else uses it. On the other hand it is very very limited
and may be suited for "wierd" cases that do not use existing subsystems.
But then I doubt that any non-GPL would do anything besides PCI/USB/1394
Now that I gave it some more thought I am sure that
platform_device_register_simple can be safely switched to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
Sorry for the noise.
