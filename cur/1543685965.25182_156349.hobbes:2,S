Yeah make -j10s won't be without impact, but I think for a lot of
interactive stuff they don't need a lot of CPU, just to get it
in a timely manner. And Martin did say it had been responsive.
Sounds like in this case your changes are causing the interactive
stuff to get less CPU or higher scheduling latency?
