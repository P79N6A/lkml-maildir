In windows Vista they've disabled atime updates by default.
And XP maintains atimes, but it uses a trick to avoid the performance
penalty we suffer in linux, similar to what Andi Kleen suggested: they
keep atime updates in memory for one hour, and only sync to disk after
that time - of course they also sync it if there's a oportunity to do it, like
when updating mtime.
