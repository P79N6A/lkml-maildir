I suspect the problem is the same as people had been having with the
serial driver, which actually turned out to be a bug in the rewritten
bottom half handlers.  I don't use scsi_mod so I can't say for sure.
However, the correct patch can be found in the March 4 mail from Ted
Ts'o (Message-Id: <200003042335.SAA02707@tsx-prime.MIT.EDU>), see the
complete thread for more info.  The patch has been incorporated into
2.3.50pre2 and should be in 2.3.50.
