No, I think read_lock() will be sufficient.
In fact, it's probably the case that rcu_read_lock() is now sufficient
locking coverage for zap_other_threads() (cc's people).
It had better be, because do_group_exit() forgot to take tasklist_lock.  It
is perhaps relying upon spin_lock()'s hidden rcu_read_lock() properties
without so much as a code comment, which would be somewhat nasty of it.
You could perhaps just call do_group_exit() from within the fault handler,
btw.

You can take the lock in the fault handler.  Nobody should be getting
pagefaults while holding tasklist_lock.  (Well, a vmalloc fault might, but
that's a special-case which doesn't allocate memory or anything like that).
