oh great, I was going to report (almost) the same for S3:
[  224.436000] uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.2: Root hub isn't suspended!
[  224.436000] usb_hcd_pci_suspend(): uhci_suspend+0x0/0xe0 [uhci_hcd]() returns -16
[  224.436000] pci_device_suspend(): usb_hcd_pci_suspend+0x0/0x1a0 [usbcore]() returns -16
[  224.436000] suspend_device(): pci_device_suspend+0x0/0x70() returns -16
[  224.436000] Could not suspend device 0000:00:1d.2: error -16
I'd also add that the 3rd attempt at suspending will simply hang with
powered down monitor but sysrq is still available.

I assume this is still true for suspend-to-ram :)
Maybe this is related, I'd like to add also that with previous kernels
(all the 2.6.17*-mm serie until 2.6.18-rc5-mm1) after the first resume I
get those annoying "resets":
[73060.848000] usb 1-2: reset low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
[73128.332000] usb 1-2: reset low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
[73586.392000] usb 1-2: reset low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
[73944.592000] usb 1-2: reset low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
when the device is reset while typing the char being typed is repeated 4
times. Suspending and resuming again seems to fix that.
Oh, here it is:
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 054c:0056 Sony Corp. 
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 046d:c001 Logitech, Inc. N48/M-BB48 [FirstMouse Plus]
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000

going to reboot to test it, hold on.
