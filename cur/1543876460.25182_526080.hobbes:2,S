It might explain why my machine hung when I tried to use
radeon with DRM on my sparc64 workstation :-)  I have
investigating that on my todo list.

I don't know what to recommend to you, getting 8MB of linear memory
really just isn't practical.
Perhaps we'll have to create something ugly like vmalloc_nobounce().
Remind me again why you're ending up with swiotlb'd pages?
vmalloc_32() uses GFP_KERNEL which should use entirely lowmem and thus
RAM below 4GB and not anything which should need bounce buffering.
You should only get swiotlb'd pages if __GFP_HIGHMEM were set in
the gfp flags.
Are you expecting to be able to virtually remap these pages in
PCI space as one huge 8MB chunk too and that's how swiotlb gets
involved?  That won't work, sorry...
