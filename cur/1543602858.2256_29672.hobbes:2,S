There is one property the kernel space method has over any user space
tool on a UP machine (and conceivably a SMP machine with more code) -
you get a complete atomic snapshot of the VM state.  Might be useful
and important, but might not be.
It would be pretty easy to change my kernel patch to produce what you're
requesting, from another sysrq key combination.
