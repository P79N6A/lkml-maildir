I have a constructive proposal:
It would make much sense to make the oom killer
leave not just root processes alone but processes belonging to a UID
lower
then a certain value as well (500). This would be:
1. Easly managable by the admin. Just let oracle/www and analogous users
   have a UID lower then let's say 500.
2. In full compliance with the port trick done by TCP/IP (ports < 1024
vers other)
3. It wouldn't need any addition of new interface (no jebanoje gawno in
/proc in addition()
4. Really simple to implement/document understand.
5. Be the same way as Solaris does similiar things.
...
Damn: I will let my chess club alone toady and will just code it down
NOW.
Spec:
1. Processes with a UID < 100 are immune to OOM killers.
2. Processes with a UID >= 100 && < 500 are hard for the OOM killer to
take on.
3. Processes with a UID >= 500 are easy targets.
Let me introduce a new terminology in full analogy to "fire walls"
routers and therabouts:
Processes of category 1. are called captains (oficerzy)
Processes of category 2. are called corporals (porucznicy)
Processes of category 2. are called privates (¿o³nierze)
