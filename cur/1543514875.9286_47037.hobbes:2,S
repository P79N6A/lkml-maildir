Thanks for all your answer: I finally got my partitions back :-)
The programms that allow me to do that are gpart, rescupt and fdisk
(I have recovered all my ext2 partitions, not tested the NTFS and
vfat one, but I don't care much about them...). And my friend Odie
was of great help: many thanks especialy to him!
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
