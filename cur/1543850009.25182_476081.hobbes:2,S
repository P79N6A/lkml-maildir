Don't you need to propagate the interrupt here?  In Xen, we inject the 
interrupt using the IDT.  As a module, you don't have access to that.  
However, you could use a software interrupt to reraise it.
I got your code running this afternoon (it's quite cool) but I noticed a 
ton of "rtc: lost some interrupts at 1024Hz." messages which leads me to 
believe.. you're dropping interrupts :-)  Things seem to hang trying to 
bring up eth0 in the guest.
BTW, have you setup a mailing list yet?
