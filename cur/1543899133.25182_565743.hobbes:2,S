    Probably, I haven't carried thoroughly tests, but up to date, it's
the most POSIX compliant shell I've found. Probably dash is crappy too,
regarding POSIX compliance, but that only reinforces my point: depending
on shells is less safe than depending on CMake.

    Probably. I didn't claim that, anyway. I said "shell" and not
"Bash". Depending on a C program is safer, IMHO, than depending on the
features of an unknown shell. And FWIW, /bin/sh can be *any* shell on
*any* system where autotools run.
    And yes, I have bash installed on my system because some people
insist in writing bash scripts while asking for "#!/bin/sh". That's
bogus.
