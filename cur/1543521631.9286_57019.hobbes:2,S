Your problem has been seen before - Out Of Memory  (virtual that is)
Currently there is no resource accounting (I blame it on this) that can
protect a system from a memory hog. The system allocates until no more is
available.
The NEXT process that asks for memory (not necessarily the pig) will get
a null pointer from malloc. This usually causes the process to terminate
(the "Out of memory for xxx messages usually preceed the exit).
Forks can also cause aborts (since the fork allocates memory for stack),
which can abort the parent process (telnetd, inetd, init (rarely), web
servers, etc).
In the short term - try adding more swap space.
IM(not so)HO: Linux needs better resource accounting. Perhaps it should
be called "controled resource allocation".
