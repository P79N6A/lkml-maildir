great! How long does the benchmark take (hours?), and is there any way 
to speed up the benchmarking (without hurting accuracy), so that 
multiple migration-cost settings could be tried? Would it be possible to 
try a few other values via the migration_factor boot option, in 0.5 msec 
steps or so, to find the current sweet spot? It used to be at 11 msec 
previously, correct? E.g. migration_factor=105 will change the cost to 
10.9 msec, migration_factor=110 will change it to 11.4, etc. Or with the 
latest snapshot you can set absolute values as well, 
migration_cost=11500 sets the cost to 11.5 msec.

at first sight the dummy domain should not be a problem, the ->cache_hot 
values are only used when deciding whether a task should migrate to a 
parallel domain or not - if there's an extra highlevel domain instance 
then such decisions are never made, so a zero value makes no difference.
