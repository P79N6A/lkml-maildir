Yes, making the config scripts do what you describe there
automagically is exactly what I meant there.

Again, we're in complete agreement here (also like what Jan
mentioned elsewhere on this thread). But then there's often
too much "suggestions" on Kconfig/Kbuild matters on lkml,
but too little code (wonder if that was what got Roman
irritated yesterday). This may be because stuff in scripts/ doesn't
quite get the kind of eyeballs kernel/ or fs/ or even drivers/ gets,
but I guess the only way to get Roman around to our view would
be start submitting patches for the solutions we're all fond of
"suggesting" :-)
