Little time? Please, do not trust me. Start oprofile and run a kernel 
build. Look, I'm not even talking about som micro benchmark explicitly 
built to exploit the thing. A kernel build.
You will find clear_page to be the *1st* kernel entry after cc1 and as.
That is bad for two reasons. The time it spends in there, and the cache it 
blows.
