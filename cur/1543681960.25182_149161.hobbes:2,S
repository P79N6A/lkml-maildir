hello,
i have some problems with the rivafb. it compiles fine, but it displays
not correct. it is hard to describe - especially in english ;). 
actually i have cursor - it looks like an underlined 'P'. if i try to
switch to an other hsync changed to 120hz. if i try to use x it works
fine (ok, i can't switch back to the console).
i don't have any interesting outputs in the messages log. you can find
my actual .config at www.erdbeere.net/.config . if you need any
screenshots i will try to find my digi-cam.
thanks,
patrick
