Subject: [PATCH 14/25] bcm43xx: init fix for possible Machine Check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/27/520

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Michael Buesch <mb@bu3sch.de>
Place the Init-vs-IRQ workaround before any card register
access, because we might not have the wireless core mapped
at all times in init. So this will result in a Machine Check
caused by a bus error.
