For me it is very stable on several servers and workstations, and for
quite some time now (since the kernel 2.3 series, had to watch the lists
for faulty combinations though). I never used kernel 2.2 with reiserfs
(3.5), but only 2.3 and 2.4 (and thus rfs 3.6). My newest workstation
and notebook have one partition (/) and thus reiserfs is root and boot
partition. On older ones it was necessary to have a small /boot
partition because of an older version of lilo. It is no use to have
reiserfs on /boot if it is small (which usually is the case), due to the
journal which is 32 meg.
The bigest point so far where the fsck tools, but they seem to be quite
usefull these days, and under active development.
