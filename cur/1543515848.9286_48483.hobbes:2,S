Hi,
On this platform, 2.2.13+ is stable but in 2.3.27-pre6 I get crashes
usually when X is running and there's a big write to the screen. The
top 1/10th of the screen fills with short green vertical lines (it's
an ATI Mach64 chipset adapter with 8MB), and the system either locks
completely (no ping, no reboot from SysRq) or might reboot when
Alt-SysRq-anything is pressed. There is nothing in the system logs.
System is PIII 450MHz, ABIT BH6 motherboard, 192MB RAM, 512MB swap,
no SCSI. Kernel is compiled with gcc-2.95.2.
I've not triggered this bug with make -j bzImage (192MB RAM, 512MB
swap) and, indeed, the memory management looks most impressive (load
up to over 190 while X continues to run, and no crash).
Thanks for reading this.
