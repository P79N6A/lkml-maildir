Hmm. Can you verify that the system boots fine if you get rid of 
acpi_skip_timer_override as per the hint from Prakash Punnoor?
That is, in the file arch/x86_64/kernel/io_apic.c, find the place where it 
does something like
	...
	if (nvidia_hpet_detected == 0) {
		acpi_skip_timer_override = 1;
		printk(KERN_INFO "Nvidia board "
			"detected. Ignoring ACPI "
			"timer override.\n");
	}
	...
and just comment that whole thing out (or at least the assignment that 
sets the "acpi_skip_timer_override" variable to 1).
Andi? You were talking about how the 64-bit machines don't have some of 
the cruft that the old PC's have.. It looks like they are accumulating 
_more_ cruft than regular x86 ever had...
