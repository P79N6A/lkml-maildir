Subject: new asm-offsets.h patch problems

I'm sometimes ending up with just "#define IA64_TASK_SIZE 0"
in include/asm-ia64/asm-offsets.h ... but only sometimes.
My build script does "make prepare; make -j8" ... so I guess
there are some races in the parallel build?  The "make prepare"
part used to do the full of build offsets.h, but now it just does
the ia64 hack.
