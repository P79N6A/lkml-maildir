I used to get the same effect when I asked pine to open the
Linux-Kernel mailbox on my system. I long since cured that by
having procmail split Linux-Kernel mail into multiple mailboxes,
one for each calendar week.
The basic problem there is that any mail client needs to know
just how many messages are in a particular folder to handle that
folder, and the only way to do this is to count them all. That's
what takes the time when one opens a large folder.
Best wishes from Riley.
