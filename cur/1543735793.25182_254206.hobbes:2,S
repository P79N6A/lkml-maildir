Now, now, would it be too hard to add a proper key definition into
input.h? I don't think you want the remote to change character sets on
Japanese machines.

I won't let you abuse the input API this way. Event type 0 is EV_SYN and
is reserved for synchronization and configuration change notifications.
Definitely not for sending events that look like keystrokes but aren't.
There is a nice ioctl, called EVIOCGRAB which will give you what you
want (the console won't be receiving the events anymore) without any
ugly hacks.
