This is true.  A write barrier ensures that the writes remain ordered,
but unless the reads are also ordered, the reader can still get confused.
For example (assuming all variables are initially zero):
writer:
	a = 1;
	smp_wmb();  /* or smp_mb() */
	b = 1;
reader:
	tb = b;
	ta = a;
The writer will (roughly speaking) execute the assignments in order,
but the reader might not.  If the reader executes the assignment from
"a" first, it might see tb==1&&ta==0.  To prevent this, we do:
reader:
	tb = b;
	smp_rmb();  /* or smp_mb() */
	ta = a;
There are a lot of variations on this theme.

Specifically:
notrace void mcount_list_func(unsigned long ip, unsigned long parent_ip)
{
        struct mcount_ops *op = rcu_dereference(mcount_list);
        while (op != &mcount_list_end) {
                op->func(ip, parent_ip);
                op = rcu_dereference(op->next);
This assumes that you are using call_rcu(), synchronize_rcu(), or
whatever to defer freeing/reuse of the ops structure.

Peter is correct when he says that Alpha does not necessarily respect data
dependencies.  See the following URL for the official story:
	
http://www.openvms.compaq.com/wizard/wiz_2637.html
And I give an example hardware cache design that can result in this
situation here:
	
http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/scalability/paper/ordering.2007.09.19a.pdf
See the discussion starting with the "Why Reorder Memory Accesses?"
heading in the second column of the first page.
Strange, but true.  It took an Alpha architect quite some time to
convince me of this back in the late 90s.  ;-)

The trick is that the machine might have a split cache, with (say)
odd-numbered cache lines being processed by one half and even-numbered
lines processed by the other half.  If reading CPU has one half of the
cache extremely busy (e.g., processing invalidation requests from other
CPUs) and the other half idle, memory misordering can happen in the
receiving CPU -- if the pointer is processed by the idle half, and
the pointed-to struct by the busy half, you might see the unitialized
contents of the pointed-to structure.  The reading CPU must execute
a memory barrier to force ordering in this case.

And I was right there with you before my extended discussions with the
aforementioned Alpha architect!
