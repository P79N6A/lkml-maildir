I had this problem as well until I realized that the following options had to be enabled in the config (provided that you have a PS/2 or AT keyboard which I guess you do).
Under input device support
==========================
Select "Serial i/o support"
Select "i8042 PC Keyboard controller"
Select "Keyboards"
Select "AT Keyboard support"
This is indicated in the help text but the current layout is very unintuitive and should be changed.
Explaination:
The first time that I compiled, I simply choose "Keyboards", no extra options appeared since "Serial i/o support" wasn't selected and thus it seemed as if everything was just fine...until I booted and the keyboard didn't work. Then I started reading help messages :-)
Regards,
David
