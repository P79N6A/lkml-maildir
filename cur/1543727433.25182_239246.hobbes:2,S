Hi,
after compiling and installing linux 2.6.8-rc3 my workstation refused to
boot the new kernel.
Trying to reinstall grub (setup hd0) only made things worse in that it
hanged in "loading stage2..".
Even from floppy I could not boot the new kernel and things got even
worse after reinstalling the files in /boot/grub in that in hanged after
the message "GRUB".
I finally figured out that these problem must be related to the kernel
and after booting linux 2.6.7 and reinstalling the files in /boot/grub
followed by the boot loader everything seems to be working fine again.
Tom
PS: My config is a software RAID 1 with reiserfs on /dev/hda2
and /dev/hdc2
