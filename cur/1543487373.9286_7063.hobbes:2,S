Hi there!
The last message I receive on screen after booting the kernel-2.2.1 on my
machine (configuration below) is:
uncompressing linux....ok booting kernel
Then the whole machine hangs and has to be resetted by reset-button.
Configuration: Digital Celebris 590 (Pentium 90 Mhz, Slim Line Case), 32 MB
Ram, S3 968 onboard, SMC IDE Controller Chip, Phoenix Bios, Quantum 240MB
HD, Quantum BigFoot,
I already tried several kernel-configurations (mainly with different PCI
Bios accesses, because on time it said: uncompressing linux...no setup
identification string found), from the most leanest kernel to the biggest
modular one. I tried the kernel rpms from redhat, running configurations
from other machines...nothing everytime the same error message.
So I tried several bios setup things which did not work either...I hope
there is someone out there who can help me (I may use 2.0.36, which works,
but it does not seem ok to me to give up, just because its not working)
