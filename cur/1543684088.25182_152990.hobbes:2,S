Well, that sort-of depends on which 'embedded' board you're talking
about really.  And the trade-off between the work needed for a hacked-up
1 off, the space that could be saved by doing this, and the space that
could be saved elsewhere.  Perhaps on the embedded_in_my_fridge machine
it might make sense, but not ever embedded device is quite so tiny and
strapped for space.
