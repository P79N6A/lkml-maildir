Here is the limitation. rebalance doesn't occur if order > 3.

Thanks, I'll take a look.

Yes. This method can drop caches, but will fragment memory. This is
not what I want. I want cache is limited to a tunable value of the
whole memory. For example, if total memory is 128M, is there a way to
trigger reclaim when cache size > 16M?
