That will likely be more useful when I've got more background knowledge;
right now my biggest problem is I'm inexperienced and haven't yet gotten
my 2-year compsci degree (more importantly, the associated knowledge
that goes with it), so things like compiler design are like "There's a
concept of turning stuff into trees and associating actions with virtual
registers and then turning that into real register accounting and
instructions, but I really don't know WTF it's doing."
I imagine once I get into the 4-year stuff I'll be able to digest
something like that; so I'll keep that in mind.  The '1st year compsci
student' crutch is annoying and I need to get rid of it so I don't feel
so damn crippled trying to do anything.

Mm.  TLB flush is expensive, and pretty unavoidable unless you do stupid
things like map libc into the same address everywhere.  TLB flush
between threads in the same process is probably avoidable; aren't
threads basically processes with the same PID in something called a
thread group?  (Hmm... creative scheduling possibilities...)
