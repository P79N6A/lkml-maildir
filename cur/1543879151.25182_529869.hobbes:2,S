BTW: any idea how this ever got triggered?  The only way I can see is if 
you're either not using libipathverbs and libibverbs and you just create 
the CQ some other way, which seems unlikely.  Do you know how Jason 
triggered this bug?
I'm also going to fix a problem where hitting the maximum number of CQs 
causes an error return, but doesn't clean up the pending list and thus 
leaks memory.
Regards,
  Robert.
