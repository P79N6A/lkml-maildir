When using suspend-to-disk, I trigger BUG_ON in ide-disk.c:1526:
	BUG_ON (HWGROUP(drive)->handler);
It seems that this assertion is intended to check that all interrupts have
been handled before idedisk_suspend returns --- but I can't find any code
which ought to do this.
More details available if needed.
