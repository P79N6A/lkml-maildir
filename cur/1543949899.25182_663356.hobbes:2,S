That's what ended up happening.  The workqueue used by
mmc_detect_change() was made freezable, so hosts could call the routine
at any time but it wouldn't do anything until the system sleep was
over.
A more flexible approach would avoid freezing the workqueue, and allow 
it to process card removals at any time.  But card insertions would be 
ignored if the mmc_host device was suspended; at resume time the core 
probes for changes that occurred during the sleep.
