I'd recommend that this file be in the /drivers/usb directory, much like
almost all other USB drivers are.

You should also probably add the following snippet to allow the USB
hotplug functionality to work properly:
static __devinitdata struct usb_device_id id_table [] = {
        { USB_DEVICE(0x09c4, 0x0011) },
        { USB_DEVICE(0x050f, 0x0180) },
        { USB_DEVICE(0x08e9, 0x0100) },
        { }                                     /* Terminating entry */
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE (usb, id_table);		
If IRDA has a class descriptor, can't you just rely on that, and not
have to worry about the individual device vendor and product ids?

A spinlock is not needed as the probe functions are called sequentially.
