Well, in all fairness, that _is_ what "platform_data" is supposed to be. A
platform-specific pointer to whatever data structure that platform needs
to have to do the device ops. Platforms that don't need the function 
pointers wouldn't have any function pointers there, while others would 
have not just the function pointers, but could have some other 
bus-dependent data too.
(And this is what at least HP-PA does, as does ARM...)
So it's definitely not unsuitable for this. It does seem like USB jumped 
the gun a bit, though.
