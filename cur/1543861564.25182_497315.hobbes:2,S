Whats wrong with just using SDL/OpenGL?  Thousands of games are made 
with SDL/OpenGL, and there are realms of Linux usage where this works 
just fine, especially for games (GP2X, etc).  In case you didn't 
notice, plenty of pro Game Developers use SDL/OpenGL just fine for 
their needs, and get the job done without grumbling and groaning 
about needing to have their hands held through the process.
I fail to see the reason this requirement has to be a 'kernel' 
interface, other than pure sheer laziness and inability to grok on 
the part of the so-called professional Game Developers.  Gaming is 
only *one* kind of application for the Linux kernel - shall we burden 
the kernel with everything everyone wants just because people fail to 
understand the proper way to assemble a Linux-based kit for their 
specific application needs?  (Hint: work with the distro builders.)
Just my .2c, but anyone suggesting that API's be crowbar'ed into the 
kernel "just to make it easier to get what you want from a single 
source" is probably not as familiar with the underlying technology, 
nor the reasons for its structured organization, as they ought to be 
before making such suggestions ..
