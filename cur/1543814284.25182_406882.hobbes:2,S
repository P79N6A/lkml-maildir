Well the name is wrong.  Because these are in general not DMA addresses,
but it may have the other desired properties.  So it may be
useable.

It doesn't fix it but it finds it.  Which is half the battle.  Once
the existing references are fixed up it makes it hard to introduce new
breakage like that, because more people see it.
As for bloat this assumes there will be some measurable bloat.
Resources are used in such a limited fashion I will be surprised if
you can measure any bloat.
