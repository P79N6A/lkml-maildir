I've got an Abit BP6 rev 1 [steel ZIF levers] purchased
mid-July'99.  It's stable under heavy load overclocked to
2 * 5.5 * 98.
I normally use MPS 1.4, but I tried 1.1 and got the same
110 MB/s for a DRAM-DRAM block move with a quick hack.
I don't know what tester people are using, nor what sort
of loop & access it's running.
The DRAM bandwidth is a bit disappointing on these boards,
as confirmed by c't, and I'm trying to resolve it through
Abit before going public.
