	HS_TIMEOUT is the result of rebalancing enable/disable_irq()
stuff. When somebody (Andrea?) changed enable/disable_irq() semantics old
PLIP code broke. These days disable_irq();disable_irq();enable_irq();
leaves IRQ *disabled*, not enabled as it used to do. Now, we need to
have equal amounts of eanble_irq() and disable_irq() on every loop. If
you'll look at sending part you'll see that there are two kinds of exits -
ones from the handshaking phase vs. everything else. They leave different
number of disable_irq() to undo. Hence the special return value - it
allows to compensate the stuff in error recovery.
	Look for my posting on l-k ([PATCH] plip breakage (2.2.0-pre1))
and comments in drivers/net/plip.c (line 382) for details.
	Be *very* accurate with irq stuff - rules had been changed here.
