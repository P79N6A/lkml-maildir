 :) I haven't even compiled with this patch, I'm just trying
to get around my ideas and thus I posted so that:
a. We had an off-site backup
b. People with experience could shout out loud if they saw
   some big-time silliness.

I suspect you mean the scheduler runqueues?
My initial idea runs as follows:
a. On each array switch, we add some fixed value
   to user->ticks. (HZ perhaps?)
b. When adding, we cap at some maximum value.
   (2*HZ perhaps?)
c. On each timer tick, we decrement current->user->ticks.
d. When decrementing, if it's below zero we just
   end this thread. (user has expired)
e. When switching threads, we take the first one that belongs
   to a non-expired user. I think this can be done by sending
   the user-expired threads to the expired array, just like
   when they expire themselves.
I'll try to code this tonight, so I'll post later on
if I'm lucky.
I think this needs much less complexity for a first version,
but I would try what you propose if I get intimate enough
with the scheduler.
Greets, Antonio.
