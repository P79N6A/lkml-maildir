not really - the old yield implementation in essence gave the task a 
time hit too, because we rotated through tasks based on timeslices. But 
the old one requeued yield-ing tasks to the 'active array', and the 
decision whether a task is in the active or in the expired array was a 
totally stohastic, load-dependent thing. As a result, certain tasks, 
under certain workloads saw a "stronger" yield, other tasks saw a 
"weaker" yield. (The reason for that implementation was simple: yield 
was (and is) unimportant and it was implemented in the most 
straightforward way that caused no overhead anywhere else in the 
scheduler.)
( and to keep perspective it's also important to correct the subject
  line here: it's not about "network slowdown" - nothing in networking
  slowed down in any way - it was that iperf used yield in a horrible
  way. I changed the subject line to reflect that. )
