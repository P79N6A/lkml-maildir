I don't have time to help debug this, but I'm getting this too, with
2.4.3 final. The previous kernel I ran was 2.4.3-pre4, and it did not
have this problem.
In my case, it's usually mozilla (I'm seeing this with the daily
snapshots, but not with mozilla-0.8.1, at least not yet), but at least
once I saw it with freeamp (2.1rc5) too.
