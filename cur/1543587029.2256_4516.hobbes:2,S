Andi,
Thanks a lot for the explanations! All clear now. (-:

Yes, good point. Saves me a whole variable in my data structs in fact, as I 
already have 32 bits worth of mostly unused, atomic flags.
sigprocmask would be rather excessive considering it requires a full 
context switch into the kernel to execute and the high frequency of 
lock/unlocks in the normal code while the handler only executes once every 
5 seconds...
Best regards,
         Anton
