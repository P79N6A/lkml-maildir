Well, if that set of patches is accepted into 2.6.19, it will likely
break other people with HyperTransport chips and cards as well.   I do
know of other HTX-slot cards in development, and some of them, at least,
do use interrupts.
So I think it needs to age enough to not break existing drivers.
Unfortunately, I still haven't had time to try your HT path with our
ipath driver, because I'm in fire-fighting mode on some customer issues.
You might be able to test it on some of your LS-1 systems in your lab,
if you need early feedback.  I'll try it, as soon as I can.

My point was that many other pci_* functions have to be called by any
driver for HyperTransport-attached chips (that aren't chipset), so why
break these out separately, rather than somehow fitting them into the
existing routines, perhaps by looking at the bus-type the device is
attached to?   
Unless we add a full set of ht_* routines (not something I'd like to see!)
I don't see a reason to do it for just these routines, other than
convenience for early testing of patch proposals, as opposed to
final code going into the mainline.
I'm not suggesting re-using existing (old) msi.c code.  I'm suggesting
making the new MSI code work for all 3 of PCI, PCIe, and HT, with the
same exact exported routine.
| Of course I don't expect the interface exported to drivers to change.
But if you add new ht_* routines that they have to call, that's
definitely a change, a new set of exported routines.   I'm questioning
whether that's really the right direction.  If you had already intended
to have them not exported in the final patches, that wasn't clear to me,
and I apologize for misunderstanding.
