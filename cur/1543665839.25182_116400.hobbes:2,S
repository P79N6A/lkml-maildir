You are actually probably hitting a hole in the file. If the client
has written beyond the eof, but not yet transmitted the data to the
server, then you would indeed probably see an EIO.
Your fix is probably correct, but could you just cross-check by seeing
if the appended patch also fixes the problem?
Cheers,
