The problem is that probably there are little "generic" syscalls. The above 
example is invalid on Alpha, for instance (they have sys_getxpid).
Also, probably, restructuring anything to take advantage of this would be very 
dangerous, error-prone and not rewarding... we (UML) had to do this because 
we had serious maintenance problems, plus the fact that we must *match* other 
syscall tables rather than having our own. Otherwise there's probably no 
reason to rebuild the table.
However, I guess that *new* syscalls are probably often generic, so for them 
there would be a good reason to have some generic idea. Who knows...
