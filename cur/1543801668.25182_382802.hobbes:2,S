[Sorry about the previous mails, I've bad problems with my connection
and need to resort to doing this remotely with very high latency.]
Just a little update and relative to the current sources.
The only code change are three lines of code: renaming fchmod to fchmodat,
adding a new parameter, passing it to __user_walk_fd, and a new one-line
wrapper function sys_chmod.  The other changes are hooking up the syscall
and the previously not-hooked-up faccessat syscal.
