Interesting idea.
I think the most trivial and reliable way would be to solder some
I^2 or similar EEPROM chip to, for example, parallel port connector.
Most motherboards have an internal I^2C bus / SMBus (for reading RAM
types and for other things) and I think it could be used to connect
the EEPROM instead of external port.
There are 512 Kbit (64 KB) and 1 Mbit (128 KB) EEPROMs available -
there is plenty of space not only for crash dump but for whole dmesg.
