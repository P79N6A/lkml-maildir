One of setserial's basic functions is to configure a ttyS device for a
serial port that you know is there.  In this patch, you are preventing
any port that is in 'PORT_UNKNOWN' state from being changed, even if
you want to change the IRQ and IO base address.  This is a different,
but nevertheless fundamental problem.
The real bug is that serial.c should allows you to change the port from
'PORT_UNKNOWN' even when it can't grab the resources for the port.
Thanks for finding it - are you able to work on this more to come up
with a better fix?
