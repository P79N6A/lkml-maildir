Only user space tasks/threads should be biased at wakeup and
consolidated for the following reasons:
* kernel threads generally perform housekeeping tasks and its rate of
  execution and cpu utilisation is far less than that of user task in
  an under utilised system.  
* Biasing at wakeup help consolidate bursty user space tasks. Long
  running user space tasks will be consolidated by load balancer.
  kthreads are not bursty, they are generally very short running.

SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE is required for sched_mc=2 and power savings while
not mandated for sched_mc=0.  We can remove NEWIDLE balance at
sched_mc=0 if that helps baseline performance.  Ingo had identified
that removing NEWIDLE balance help performance in certain benchmarks.
I do not get what you have mentioned by NEWIDLE off?  Is there
a separate user space control to independently set or reset
SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE at a give sched_domain level?
Thanks for the detailed review.
