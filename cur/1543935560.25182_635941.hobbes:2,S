In do_producer(), there are the following lines in the main loop:
	/* Send random lengths of data */
	messages[i].length = (rand() % MAXLEN) + sizeof(size_t);
	iov[i].iov_len = messages[i].length;
The entire "struct sockmsg" is sent across the socket, so the first
size_t in each message contains the length of the entire message
(including the size_t).  This size gets picked up at the
recv(...,MSG_PEEK) line in do_consumer().
Thanks,
Brent
