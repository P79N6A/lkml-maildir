Me, too, similarly.

Well, I think there's another way, not sure if that's feasible, but it
looks so:
You say "no active IO and nothing that initiates that". So add a
MNT_KILLBUSY flag that sends SIGKILL to all process that have resources
on the file system and wake them from "D" state. That way, processes
holding resources will be nuked right away, and the kernel can let go of
the file system.
Possibly needed: Patch other parts of the kernel to allow SIGKILL to
kill a process in 'D' state, interrupting its operations.
FreeBSD can do umount -f for anything except /, not sure how it
implements that, never looked at the source. unmount(2) says "Active
special devices continue to work, but any further accesses to any other
active files result in errors even if the filesystem is later
remounted."
That'd be ok for me, it'd be some sort of a stale local file handle for
the processes that got their filesystem pulled from beneath their feet,
and it's probably the only way to prevent corruption. 
Newly connected processes after a mount should be unaffected by all this
and behave as though the file system had never been (lazily or forcibly)
unmounted before.
However, thanks for the first step in the right way.
