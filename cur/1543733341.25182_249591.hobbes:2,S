I am not a lawyer... :)
Just an unsatisfied customer who try to use properly a piece of hardware
that I own because I paid for it... Am I a criminal because of this ???

Right. I forgot Japan, of course.

It would be very interesting to know if you encounter this bug.
This bug has never been reported on a Toshiba Libretto.

This bug is know to appear more often on X, but it might appear in some
other places and not having being noticed yet... We don't know...

I will, but just right now I don't have much time to spend on it, but my
next goal is to identify a way to reproduce it (not an easy task I'm
afraid). So, I will keep people informed.

Well, we should first find where is the bug. ;-)
But, we already have the assembly code of the CMS 4.4 thanks to the HP
tablet-PC update (see:
http://h18007.www1.hp.com/support/files/compaqtabletpc/us/download/18120.html
).
So, if some people are interested by this project of
CrackingTransmeta@Home, be my guest. :-)
