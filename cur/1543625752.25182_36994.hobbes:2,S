Its all there now and as you suggested I've added the configure script so
autoconf is no longer required to build it.

Also there is the zerocopy nbd patch I did for my UKUUG talk last year on my 
patches page: 
http://www.chygwyn.com/~steve/kpatch/
 its out of date now

It should make things even faster or at least more efficient if we are maxing 
out the network already :-)
Steve.
