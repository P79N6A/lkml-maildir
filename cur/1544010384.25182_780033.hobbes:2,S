Will do.  It takes a little bit of time to reproduce, so I'll respond 
now with information from my current kernel and update once the new 
kernel is running.

I wanted to get the call to /sbin/modprobe in there as well, so I had to 
do it about 10 times before I could catch it.  I also stopped 
unimportant processes on that box to eliminate additional variables.
There is one other variable I didn't mention.  The machine is diskless 
and running on an nfs root.  I have tried to eliminate this variable via 
simple testing (just running /sbin/modprobe at the commandline returns 
instantly), but wanted to mention it.
The box was 100% idle before starting the pilot program and running the 
task trace.  I added gettimeofday() around my socket() call and got 
about 1290000us - 1490000us on average.  Using a socket() call with 
protocol NETLINK_ROUTE returns in about 5us - 8us.  Certain other 
protocol types like NETLINK_FIREWALL also have the same long delay.
