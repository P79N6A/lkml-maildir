Yes, I noticed that if you were having this problem, .24 would also be
complaining to you about creating sysfs links.  I'll make up a .24 patch
for -stable after this.
Kay just pointed out that I can use a struct device field instead of
creating my own in the bus device, so I'll simplify the patch and then
send it to Linus in a bit.
Thanks so much for testing quickly and letting me know.
