Looks like the nv driver just ignored the EDID and used one of
its built-in VESA modes.  If you notice, X's EDID ouput is the same
as nvidiafb's. But the resulting timings are different.
In contrast, nvidiafb will attempt to use the EDID, and only as a last
resort, use one of the timings in the global mode database.

If you don't have a "Modeline" section in Xorg.conf, X will use one of its
timings.

:-) Yes, many have been burned by this assumption.  If you do want
2.4 behavior, you can compile fbcon statically, nvidiafb as a module.
Doing modprobe nvidiafb will automatically give you a framebuffer
console.

read-edid though uses the Video BIOS to grab the EDID.  So even your
card's BIOS is having problems doing i2c/ddc.

Hmm, I'll check on that again.

Yes, it does look like that the snow can be due to bandwidth limitation.

Oh well, I think rivafb and nvidiafb have different i2c timeouts.  I believe
the timeouts in nvidiafb are more correct.
