Well, nobody reported any down-side to this, and the up-side is that
having this kind of API (and a platform's implementation thereof)
finally makes it possible to let USB controllers properly issue
wakeup events on typical embedded hardware.
So I'll be submitting this for 2.6.18 soon, and at91rm9200 platform
updates to make clk_must_disable(clk32k) replace the current platform
private at91_suspend_entering_slow_clock() call in the USB and serial
drivers.  When other platforms add support for more of their different
hardware sleep states, and implement, their USB host and peripheral
controller drivers can be updated accordingly.
