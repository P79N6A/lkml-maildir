I agree.  I have seen really fabulous system response since Rik's 
changes were merged in.
I have managed to crash my machine a couple of times (I am working on 
getting a
serial debugging connection set up, since I don't see any OOPS 
messages), but I think this
is not terribly surprising.  My impression is that system responsiveness 
is much improved.
Let's hang in there a bit longer.  We are making rapid progress on 
testing and fixing.
