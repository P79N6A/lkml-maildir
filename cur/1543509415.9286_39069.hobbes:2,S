Dear Amazing KernelHackers,
Is it possible to connect 2 videocards, a keyboard & mouse on their PS/2
ports, a keyboard & mouse on their USB ports, find two geeks and let
them use the single computer with their own X and stuff? Of course they
will have to use the same kernel and so, but is it possible for each of
the geeks (/me one of them :-) to have their own system and use the
computer together at the same moment?
Can someone say anything about hardware/software issues, and if not
possible; what about the (near) future?
That would be just cool!
Thanx a lot, and have fun!
		Ookhoi
PS, I'm aware of multi head (for X).
