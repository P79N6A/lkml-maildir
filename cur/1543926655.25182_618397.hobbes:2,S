You mean the page contains the upper [40;63] bits? 
Sounds reasonable, although I don't remember seeing that when I looked
at the perfmon code last.

That sounds bad.

Can you give a concrete use case for something that cannot be done
without custom buffer formats?

The existing oprofile code works already fine on x86, no real
need for another one.

Exactly that makes the support for random custom buffers questionable.
e.g. as I can see the main advantage of perfmon over existing setups
is that it support PEBS etc., but with your custom buffer formats which
are by definition incompatible with PEBS you would negate that advantage
again.
Ok IBS will probably need some special handling.

Why this insistence against changing anything?
