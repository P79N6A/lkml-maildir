a.  If CONFIG_DUMMY (dummy net driver support) is enabled,
drivers/net/setup.c has an error on sb1000_dev (not defined)
at line 312: register_netdev(&sb1000_dev).
b.  If USB SCSI (mass storage) is enabled, PROC_SCSI_USB_SCSI
(*was* from include/linux/proc_fs.h) is not defined.
What's happening with proc_fs.h?
