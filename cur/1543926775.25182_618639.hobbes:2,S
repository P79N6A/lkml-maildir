Hi,
I have replaced my machine with another one which gives many ECC errors.
At first sight they may be pessimistic because memtest (with ECC off)
doesn't find anything (I'm letting run it overnight, I'll see tomorrow
morning if it really didn't find anything).
I'd like to let it run without thoses ECC messages (which slow it down
pretty much), but
- man bootparam doesn't say anything
- my git tree is on that machine, so I can't access it
- I couldn't successfully google for it
Thanks for your help,
	Xav
