With a popular 8250 UART on the other end, you need to ensure that
you disable the CTS signal with sufficient time (== at least the
number of bytes in the transmit FIFO) so that the transmission stops.
This is because many 8250 UARTs don't have any hardware linkage
between the CTS signal and the transmitter.  Later 8250 UARTs which
do have automatic hardware flow control allow for this, as do
most other serial peripherals.
I, therefore, strongly suggest that you arrange to do the same -
iow, deassert RTS when your buffer is approaching approx. 2/3 full
rather than absolutely full.
