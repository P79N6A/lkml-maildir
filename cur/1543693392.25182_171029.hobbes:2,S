My word is hardly authoritative, but istr hearing that the original 
devfs-maintainer has abandoned this code (probably after multiple 
complaints about it being badly implemented, full of bugs, locking 
issues/races, etc).
Not having used it with 2.6 yet, I don't know much about it's status in 
that tree.
So, although devfs may still work, and even be in a better condition than 
udev (at present); no longer maintained (and little intention of 
changing) may be considered equivalent to obsolete.
