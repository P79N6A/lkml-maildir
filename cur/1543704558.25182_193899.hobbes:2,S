I will try it tomorrow. Sorry I am a little slow on the e-mails, I will do 
what I can to help, but I can't move as fast, or devote as much time as I 
would like, im in college right now. I will apply the patch and see if it 
makes my oops go away. 
	Thanks so much for your help. I appreciate all the hard work you guys do on 
the kernel and all the mind-racking problems that come with an 
ever-increasing userbase.
