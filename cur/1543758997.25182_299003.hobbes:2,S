Subject: architecture to implement communication between static kernel with dynamic module
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

there is one my_own module
which i will insert whenever i like through 
insmod.
thus when the module is loaded it will create a proc
file 
now i want to send the structure variable of
task_struct
i.e p to the module from the kernel at point when the
execution passes
through forking a new process i.e 
at the function do_fork() in fork.c in linux/kernel
folder
how to do this
how can i call the module from that point  (i.e in
do_fork())
and pass the task_struct *p as parameter to the module
can i declare an arbitary name in fork.c of my module
and compile the new kernel?
i think i cannot since i am inserting a dynamic module
to a static kernel executable
and how does the kernel will know that this module
will be attached later to it.
it will show errors while compiling the new modified
kernel
can you help me ?
what path i must take
thanks 
sounak
