Tim,
Great work on finding this!

Holy crap!  I wonder where else in the kernel gcc is doing this. (of
course I'm using gcc4 so I don't know).  Is there another gcc attribute
to actually tell gcc that a variable is really mostly read only (besides
placing it in a mostly read only elf section)?
What was wrong with the original WARN_ON_ONCE with
  if (unlikely(condition) && __warn_once)
This didn't have the cache crash problem too, did it?
I don't have a gcc3 around to test.
