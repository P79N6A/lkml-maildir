I am running rawio with the following options:
rawread -p 16 -m 1 -d 1 -x -z -t 0 -s 4096
The queue depth on sda is 4.

rawio is actually performing sequential reads, but I don't believe it is
purely sequential with the multiple processes.
I am currently running the test with longer runtimes and will post
results once it is complete. 
I've also attached the rawio source.
