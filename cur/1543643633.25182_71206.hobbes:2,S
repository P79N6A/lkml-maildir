Can someone point me to some documentation or an example
or give me a quick rundown on how I should use the new
tagged block request structure in 2.5.3x?
It looks like something I want. I've already tried issuing
"special" requests as (re)ordering barriers, and that works 
fine. How does the tag request interface fit in with that,
if it does?
