Hi,
first of all please apologize me because I didn't subscribe the list. I 
really even don't know if this list is the appropriate place to have my 
question discussed but I didn't found any better one.
I installed a RedHat 7.1 system on a 4 way 1.4 Gz Compaq DL580 server 
with kernel 2.4.2 and everything goes right. Because of some other 
prerequisite needs I had to upgrade the kernel to 2.4.9-34.
After the upgrade the system is reporting that the machine has 8 cpu 
instead of 4. I have been looking for some kind of information on the 
Internet (www.google.com/linux) about that but I didn't have success.
Does anybody can tell me if I will face some major problem and why the 
system is detecting (or only reporting) the wrong number of cpus ? There 
is anything that I can do to have my system detecting the right number 
of cpus ?
Attached there are a tar.gz file containing :
nohup.out => standard output from make bzImage
modules.out => standard output from make modules
modules.err => standard error from make modules
cpuinfo => /proc/cpuinfo
The kernel was compiled using the kernel.....-enterprise config from 
/usr/src/linux-2.4/configs (smp=yes, highmem=64M)
Thanks in advance.
