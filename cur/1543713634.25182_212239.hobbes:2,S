but I have already done that ;)
I ran fsck.reiserfs on 04/01, first I ran
fsck.reiserfs /dev/hdb1
then
fsck.reiserfs --fix-fixable /dev/hdb1
but it said me I had to rebuild tree to fix the errors, so I ran
fsck.reiserfs --rebuild-tree /dev/hdb1
And that's ok now
I discovered those reiserfs errors because I was not able to modify some
datas on my /home (which is /dev/hdb1)
I have other logs with reiserfs errors if you want.
Moreover those errors *disappeared* since I use non-mm 2.6.5-rc3 kernel
