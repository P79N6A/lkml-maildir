I think I'll go with new_semid_ds, new_shmid_ds, new_msqid_ds, and
new_ipc_perm as suggested by Manfred. The kernel private structures will
be shmid_kernel, msg_queue, sem_array, and kern_ipc_perm.
I was just a little concerned about a patch that would rename a bunch of
kernel structures :)

I should have made it more clear that that was really a halfhearted
suggestion... my real question was whether or not we had to support libc5
compiles at all. If we do, then we can't rename any structures in the
kernel include files. If we don't, then whatever is in the kernel source
code shouldn't matter, because it won't ever be seen when compiling any
portable software. (glibc should wrap everything specified by POSIX,
right?)
I'll re-do the patch taking this and Manfred's suggestions into account.
(the kernel private structures will be in ipc/{msg,sem,shm}.c, and the
user visible structures will be in include/linux/{msg,sem,shm}.h)
Thanks for the input,
Chris Wing
