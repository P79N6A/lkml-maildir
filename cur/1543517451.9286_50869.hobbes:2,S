	Hi everybody,
	First of all, I'm not currently on the list (but will read the
archive), so please cc me for faster dialog...
	My boss is using a high end HP Kayak workstation (Pentium III,
adaptec + NCR SCSI adapters with only one disk on the Adaptec, ...)
with Mandrake 6.1 distro (standard Mandrake kernel 2.2.9 + SMP). The
box is used as a desktop (light load, no reboots).
	This morning he rebooted the machine and discover that some
files were missings. Basically, all the files that he has touched in
the last 3 weeks (10 Nov) have gone ! C programs, compiled files,
boomark file, ... Of course, no backups. He is not very happy...
	When I looked in the logs, the shutdown seem to have been
clean (I see things getting killed, but when the box rebooted fsck did
find that the disks were not umounted cleanly. Then, while doing the
fsck, for each of the files, it complain about it like this :
		Entry 'XXX' in XXX (XXX) has unused/deleted inode XXX. CLEARED.
	Basically, there are two pages of this, and all the precious
files have been "cleared". A massacre...
	However, during the 3 weeks, my boss was able to read/compile
all those files and work with them normally, so I believe that only
the metadata was corrupted by the data itself was OK.
	Is there any tool/command under Linux enabling to inspect the
content of an inode and dumping it in a file ? I believe that this may
allow us to recover a large portion of those files.
	Thanks...
	Jean
