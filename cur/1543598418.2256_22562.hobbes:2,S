"Hot" pages are pages that have been touched more than once.  The idea of
use-once (on the read side) is to retain the readahead pages just long enough
to use them, and not a lot longer.  If you've seen streaming IO pages getting
evicted before being used, I'd like to know about it because something is
broken in that case.
