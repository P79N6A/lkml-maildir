Yes. With IBM's DSDT, to be more specific. I've filed a bug in the bugzilla, 
and tried to track it down, under careful guidance of Yu Luming, but general 
lack of time stops me from actively pursuing this target. 
Similar threads are appearing on this list regularly, and symptoms are very 
close to this bug, so I'm sure this will be fixed eventually (someone's 
comment about card not powering up (not entering D0) seems to be very close 
to the truth).
