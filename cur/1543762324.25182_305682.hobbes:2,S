This patch won't apply to the 2.6.11.5 I have here -- the driver is
clearing ~0xFC already. The description makes me suspect that the patch
is meant to go the other way, and that would be wrong. Use ethtool if
you want to enable WOL, default in Linux net drivers is off.
Please don't send patches as application/octet-stream, that's
annoying. Send either text/plain or inline.
