You miss my point completely.  The kernel has ALREADY chosen a task to 
kill.  I don't care to adjust the 'badness' function.  The kernel has 
already chosen a bad task.
If you read my post, the bug is that the kernel CANNOT kill that process?  
Why?  If it's really a bad process, shouldn't it be the one that gets 
killed? 
With you patch we have:
1) Kernel goes OOM
2) Kernel picks the worst task to kill using badness()
3) Kernel attempts to kill this task but fails due to some {reason|bug}.
4) Kernel now picks some other task to kill even though the 'baddest' one 
is allowed to hang out.
This is my question, and I don't see how the patch addresses it.
David
