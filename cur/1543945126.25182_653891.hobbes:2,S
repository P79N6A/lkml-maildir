I have no problem with that, as long as the application layer is responsible for
tearing down and re-establishing the connections. The RDMA/transport layers
are incapable of tearing down and re-establishing a connection transparently
because connections need to be approved above the RDMA layer.
Further the teardown will have visible artificats that the application
must deal with,
such as flushed Recv WQEs.
This is still, the RDMA device will do X and will not worry about Y. The reasons
for not worrying about Y could be that the suspend will be very short, or that
other mechanisms have taken care  of all the Ys independently.
For example, an HPC cluster that suspended the *entire* cluster would not
have to worry about dropped packets.
