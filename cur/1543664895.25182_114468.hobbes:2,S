The reality is that most quad Tulip boards were designed before 1999,
and therefore act as I described.
Most of the experience is with quad Ethernet adapters, as there are few
other common PCI boards with bus bridges.

This seems to be what most x86 BIOSes assume (almost all BIOSes use the
Intel reference code for PCI setup), even from 1995-era machines.
But again, this does not match how _most_ of the quad boards are wired.
Curiously, non-x86 machines usually work fine without the work-around,
meaning that they have a different interpretation.
