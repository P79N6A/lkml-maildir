You *dont* need bios support to do suspend-to-disk, as swsusp
shows. That is generic across all machines. I believe improving swsusp
(it is pretty slow these days, partly because it trashes all caches:
it does so by applying artifical memory pressure) is much better
project than trying to find out what value do you need in order for
BIOS to compress ram.
