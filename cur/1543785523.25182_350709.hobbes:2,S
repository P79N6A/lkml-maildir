For that reason I thought the best way is: using the
option-name given out, by make menuconfig or make
config... And you can even easily upgraded it if the
option-name(for the same Hardware) is changed by a new
Kernel. By only putting this new option-name in the
rules_list with the same rule.

Yes your right. The idea(eventhuogh it is a dream) is
that, this Framework might be hopefully in the future,
a part of the Kernel. So it can be updated everytime
before a new Kernel will be releases.
