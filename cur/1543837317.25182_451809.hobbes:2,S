At the risk of stating the obvious, let me try to explain what each
method does:
1. standard
Every read access to a file/directory causes an atime update.
2. nodiratime
Every read access to a non-directory causes an atime update.
3. lazy atime
The first read access to a file/directory causes an atime update.
4. noatime
No read access to a file/directory causes an atime update.
In comparison, lazy atime will cause more atime updates for
directories and vastly fewer for non-directories.  Effectively atime
is turned into little more than a flag, stating whether the file was
ever read since the last write to it.  And it appears as if neither
mutt nor the shell use atime for more than this flagging purpose, so I
am rather fond of the idea.
