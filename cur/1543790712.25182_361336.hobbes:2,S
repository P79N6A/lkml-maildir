There's a problem with that patch, though ;-/  S390 is never defined by
arch/s390/Kconfig; ARCH_S390 is.  From the fast grep it looks like there
is one more place with the same problem: drivers/char/Kconfig has
config HW_CONSOLE
        bool
        depends on VT && !S390 && !UML
        default y
and the second term is always true here.  Why do we have that dependency,
anyway, when s390 doesn't include drivers/char/Kconfig at all?
