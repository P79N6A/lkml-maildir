Well, as part of the kernel, I guess we could add an updated ascii version.

Those docs are a little out of date and incomplete, though.
There's no mention of FUTEX_REQUEUE, and no mention of the important
token-passing property: that the value returned from FUTEX_WAKE is
equal to the number of calls which return 0 from FUTEX_WAIT.
(Only when FUTEX_FD is not used; FUTEX_FD is broken with respect to
token passing at the moment).
