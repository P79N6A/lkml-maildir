What about argvc ?

Yes, we can replace one hack (used in 2.2) with another one (you just
described) and change kernel so this second hack will work. My point is
simple: if we need to change kernel at all then why not implement proper
solution ? If program want to change argument list or environment list
then why notallow to do exactly this ? Why we should cut tonsils over
asshole ? Why not do it straight ? There are exist functions to change
environment list and arguments list (setenv,  putenv, setproctitle; putenv
is even POSIX AFAIK). But when you are using those functions NOTHING is
changing in /proc/<number>/cmdline and /proc/<numeber>/environ or changing
in strange, really strange way. IMHO it can be called error. Yes, not
exactly kernel error, rather glibc error. Just one small thing: you CAN
NOT fix that error from userspace without changes in kernel.
