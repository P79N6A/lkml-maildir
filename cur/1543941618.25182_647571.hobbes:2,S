Could you factor out dead code removal to a separate (pre-)patch?

Even if this patch contains only trivial changes, the amount of them
and the fact that it intermixes different logical changes (shortening
names, dead code removal and comments beautification) makes it somehow
non-trivial to review.
General comment:
please have some mercy on the reviewer (in this case me ;) and spread
the changes across more patches (it should also be easier for you since
with more patches it is more likely that the more changes get applied
the first time and you will have less code to recast/resubmit).

hmm, this comment looks ugly now because of an extra long first line...

it is not worth doing it for the sake of two characters saved,
(especially when we take into the account that both variables are
 removed by patch #26)

this one is write-only, can be removed

how's about blk_size?

all of the above renames seem to be not worth it
the reason is that this change sets the number of people who understand (at
least partially) pipelined operation from to near to zero to a definitive zero

'vendor_id' and 'product_id' can also be converted to local variables

ulong -> unsigned long
Please recast/resubmit.
