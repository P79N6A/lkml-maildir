  I don't see anything which says we can't implement sync(2) as your
checkpoint, as long as we don't keep the current implementation which
could hang forever in theory, and for hours in practice. I don't think
that violates the standard, and it should be safe.
  I said before that we could make sync(2) fast and just put up a barrier
to keep additional io from being queued, and I still like that. Pass on
the need for checkpoint, or the portability thereof. I would expect all
current programs to work if cync(2) worked like your checkpoint(2).
  Glad you read the SuSv2 the same way!
