As I mentioned before the bus addresses for the pages I allocate are (as
expected) always in the same memory range. The only difference is that 
if the kernel was compiled with HIGHMEM support the sound card sometimes
doesn't read the correct values.

No pattern. In fact if I start/stop the sound application (with a mainly idle machine)
I usually end up allocating the same memory pages. The first couple of 
times it works as expected and then the card starts reading some bogus values.

I'm already using pci_set_dma_mask and pci_alloc/free_consistent.
