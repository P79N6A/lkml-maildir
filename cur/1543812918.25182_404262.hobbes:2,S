Do you guys reckon it might be worthwhile adding Sparc's sequential 
consistency, TSO, RMO and PSO models, although I think only RMO is used 
in the Linux kernel? References can be found for example in:
   Solaris Internals, Core Kernel Architecture, p63-68:
           Chapter 3.3: Hardware Considerations for Locks and
                        Synchronization
   Unix Systems for Modern Architectures, Symmetric Multiprocessing
   and Caching for Kernel Programmers:
           Chapter 13 : Other Memory Models
Or is DaveM the only one fiddling with Sparc memory barriers implementation?
