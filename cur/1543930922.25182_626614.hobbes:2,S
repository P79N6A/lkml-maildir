Ummm, no.
UDP is stateless, a stripped down copy of TCP we simply
do not need.  We also do not need XML in the kernel either.
If they want to support things like this they should do it in the
firmware of the management entity like every other sane server
platform does these days.
The console and OOPS messages should go over an extremely resilient
transport which is as simple as possible which usually means shared
memory or I/O memory with some simple handshake or doorbell.  This
gets it to the management entity board or whatever, and how it gets
from there to the remote system is it's business not that of the
kernel.
Not TCP, and definitely not this XML SOAP crap.
