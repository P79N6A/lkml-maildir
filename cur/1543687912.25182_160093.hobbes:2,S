I suspected ACPI so I tried booting it with :
 acpi=off		no shutdowns, no oops
 pci=noacpi		within seconds as I plug 650+ it shutdowns (tried three times)
 pci=usepirqmask	survives a _lot_ longer (several mins) but as soon as I
			`cardctl insert` -> shutdown
ACPI problem ?
Any hints what to check next ? I'm welcome to patches ..
