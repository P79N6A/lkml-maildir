"Me too" - when I enable DMA it's not long before the system stops 
responding altogether. Without DMA, I get a data read rate of about 800KBps.
But also, I have two identical drives attached - hda and hde (both 
ST380023AS). Even if I don't turn on DMA, if I am using both fairly 
intensively at the same time (at least that's the only thing I can identify 
as an apparent common difference), one will (on random occasions) start 
returning errors for every access. If this happens to be the drive that the 
operating system is installed on, the result is somewhat fatal. If it's the 
other drive I can continue, but any attempt to access it fails. There are 
some syslog entries that appear to relate to this:
