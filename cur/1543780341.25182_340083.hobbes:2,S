Interesting. 
I have no idea what the core problem is, but one problem will often lead
to others.  My scsi problem froze some apps that couldn't be paged in
from the "failing" disk, for example.
Something going wrong in the kernel can delay other devices for too long,
maybe your network driver was hit by nasty latency in the middle of 
something
as the scsi controller reset itself.  It may also be memory scribbling.
I sometimes gets x lockups with rc5.  Sometimes they just lock one display,
sometimes the whole machine locks solid necessitating a reset. sysrq+B
did not work, on either keyboard.
rc5 is no good for amd64, and it doesn't need power management to go wrong.
