Sure, but you use a 64bit read/store in set_bit/clear_bit etc., right? 
If yes then you can't use this unless you rewrite them to use 32bit store
- otherwise it will conflict with the atomic_t counter in the 64bit slot
which is not protected.
I think my current patch is fine for you - you can still optimize it
this way, but it should already work. Jakub's version would break though.
