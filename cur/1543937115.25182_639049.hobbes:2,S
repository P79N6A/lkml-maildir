btw, just found a checkpatch.pl buglet, it gets confused on zero-sized 
files:
 $ echo -n > /tmp/1.c
 $ scripts/checkpatch.pl --file /tmp/1.c
 ERROR: Does not appear to be a unified-diff format patch
 total: 1 errors, 0 warnings, 0 lines checked
 Your patch has style problems, please review.  If any of these errors
 are false positives report them to the maintainer, see
 CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
(this broke my code-quality scriptlet)
