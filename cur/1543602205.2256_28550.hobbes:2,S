Providing an interface to run arbitrary code in kernel space is definentily
against kernel policy.  As adding syscalls from modules have long been
officially off limits.  If the DRI code allows you to smash arbitrary pieces
of memory it probably needs a few checks.  DRI should be an interface
layer that makes it as safe as possible to directly access the video
card from user space.

VMmon where it basically allows you to run arbitrary code at the kernel level
does appear to be complete source to me.  Complete source to an interface
layer yes, but not complete source.

Well whatever is loaded with VMmon counts as a binary only kernel module.
