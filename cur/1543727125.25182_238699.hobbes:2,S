Hi Igno,
I have the same troubles with O3 at home on my SMP machine, however
since the same kernel (2.6.8-rc2-mm2-O3) works flawlessly here at work
on a UP P4 I thought it to be SMP related.
I also tried booting my dual athlon with noapic but that did not solve
the problem.
I have not had enough time yet to file a proper bug report but seeing
this message I wanted to second it.
Are there any known SMP related problems with your patches?
and would my dmesg and .config from home be enough ?
kind regards,
Peter Zijlstra
