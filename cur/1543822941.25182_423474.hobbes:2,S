... or open the script file (which there kernel has to do anyway),
attach it to some unused fd (e.g. fd3) and pass  "/dev/fd/3" to the
interpreter rather than "/the/shell/script".
Then the interpreter doesn't need to be able to open the file for
read.
However it isn't clear that this is really a gain, as the person
running the script could use ptrace or similar to take a copy of the
script, the bypassing the missing 'r' permission.
Mind you, with ptrace, it isn't too hard to get a copy of a normal
executable that is mode '111'....
The whole concept of having files that are executable but not readable
is completely broken - it gives the appearance of protection without
the reality.
