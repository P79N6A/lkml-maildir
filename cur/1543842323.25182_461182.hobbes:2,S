Thank you, I'll stay tuned.

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/pthread_mutex_init.html
From ERRORS section of pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol:
	The pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol() function shall fail if:
	[ENOTSUP]
	    The value specified by protocol is an unsupported value. 
And ENOTSUP is not enumerated in ERRORS section of pthread_mutex_init.
