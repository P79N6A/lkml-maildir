Hello,
I upgraded to linux kernel version 2.2.8 from 2.2.7 and I get the
following:
update: Switching to sync(2) instead of bdflush(2)
This happens after the root file systems is mounted rw.
The same situations occurs with 2.3.0, but doesn't with 2.2.7.
What is going on? Is there anything I can do?
TIA
