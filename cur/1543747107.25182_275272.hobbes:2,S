vesafb is assuming that the memory used in the current screen mode
xres*yres*depth rounded up to nearest power of 2, is the amount of
ram the card has, which is not just wrong, it's dumb.

which is an ugly hack for the above problem imo.
vesafb:nomtrr also fixes the problem, and leaves X free
to set things up correctly in my experience.
If vesafb can't get it right, maybe it shouldn't be
attempted to do it in the half-assed way it currently does.
