That's because the patch is split up, those bits are on the proc_misc
one.
I agree, btw. ;)
Adding a "trusted user group"-like configuration option could be useful,
as it's done within grsecurity, among that the whole thing might be good
to depend on a config. option, but that implies using weird ifdef's and
the other folks.
