I don't know a thing about fat layout, but it appears that it uses a
linked list of blocks, and if that list ends up pointing back onto
itself, the kernel goes into an infinite loop in several places chasing
its way to the end of the list.
The below patch fixed it for me, and I was able to mount and read
your filesystem image.
Unless someone has a smarter fix, I'll send this to the kernel
maintainers in a week or two.
