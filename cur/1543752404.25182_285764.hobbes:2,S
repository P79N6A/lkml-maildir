Shouldn't connector.h go into include/linux so that everyone can use it
within the kernel?  If so, then it's dependancy on cn_queue.h needs to
be fixed up too (why not just merge them both together)?

This can just be:
	#include "cn_queue.h"
if you end up still needing it.
Sorry for taking so long to get back to this, was on vacation.
