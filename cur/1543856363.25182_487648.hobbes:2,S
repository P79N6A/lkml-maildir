I only have a screenshot with no backtrace, if you want to see the
function names in the backtrace, please tell me what I need to do.

I was running a 2.6.19-ge??? kernel before (I don't remember which
version exactly) and it was running fine, today I upgraded to v2.6.19
and now I have this crash. 2.6.18 works fine, too.
The bug happens when gentoo wants to bring up eth0 (starting the lo
device works fine), even a simple 'ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.11' will
crash the kernel.
The computer is a Shuttle XPC with an AMD 64bit CPU, network card is
integrated in the nforce chipset.
