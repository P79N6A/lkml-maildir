OK, so no problems there...

This could be a problem, though - now I've looked in to it, the
maximum recommended current drain on the parallel port seems to be
really low :-(.
I've CC'ed Alan - maybe he can offer some advice.
(Alan - basically we're thinking of using this LED-on-parallel-port
driver for a standardised 'front panel', showing things like interrupt
being serviced, BKL taken, etc, for debugging purposes.)
