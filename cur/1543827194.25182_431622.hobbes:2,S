	Yeah, you're not the only one to point this out.

	Depends on how close you are in proximity to the console, I
suspect.  Point is, something _broke_.
	Regardless of the name, clearly we have a _different_
filesystem.  With a clean unmount, a journaled ext3 is still a valid
ext2.  With a clean unmount, an extended-attribute ext3 is still a valid
plain ext3 and a valid ext2.  With a clean unmount, a dir_index ext3 is
still a valid plain ext3 and a valid ext2.  An extents ext3 is NEVER a
valid plain ext3 or ext2.
	What happens today if you have a filesystem in fstab that
has no fsck in /sbin (eg, we all pick the name 'ext4', it says 'ext4' in
fstab, but there is no /sbin/fsck.ext4)?  Does "fsck -a" skip the
partition, or halt and fail the boot?  If the latter, I suspect that the
only solution is "I hope you don't encounter this on remote machines ha
ha ha".  If it skips, we have yet another reason that using the same
name is a bad thing.
