I'd hope that for a smart phone and a router the owner can install whatever he wants
(that is, he has the private key). As for the card reader, I'd hope that using a
modified card reader isn't enough for fraud to succeed, or else the whole thing is
designed stupid. That said, the credit card system seems insecure anyway, with readers
being able to steal useful information.

These are real problems.

There are other similar papers. The conclusion is that if someone really wants it,
he will get it from your device. Not sure if it was this paper or another one, but
volatile memory can be read out after the power went off. It's even possible to
retrieve overwritten data if it wasn't done very carefully, both RAM and flash.
If the tampering is done for a very short time, the detectors will probably miss it.
Or the tampering is done with the one thing the device wasn't protected against.
Or they think up some new way to bypass the protections.
Anyway, the question is what you're trying to protect. In general it's to keep the
code hidden, because there are plenty of obscure companies that steal that expensive
code and use it for their products. But it can also be a private key or something.

True. (Though asymmetric doesn't mean it has to be RSA. ;-)

Yes. But with that comes the obligation to publish your code under the GPL to your
customers, keep that in mind.

Only true if that filesystem isn't initramfs embedded in the kernel library! Then it
gets the same protection as the kernel for free.

You did? We only saw a MPI implementation, nothing more. All the above mentioned
arguments and reasoning only applies to a complete implementation, not to an
incomplete partial solution, which on its own is useless. Don't mix up the binary
signing thing with a nice stand alone RSA crypto module.
That said, it was nice to share the RSA code, no matter what.

I fully agree with this, but only for a RSA crypto API module.

I've no time right now, but I'll look it up when you've posted the crypto API version.

As far as the memory management, I didn't mean to hardcode the size of the modulus,
but to have a hard coded limit (e.g. 4096 bits). The modulus can vary, as long as
it's less than the limit. As for the block size, it depends on what scheme you use.
In general the block size isn't exactly equal to the modulus, but smaller, and the
message is padded in some way. It depends on how you sign the binary hash. So maybe
it's best to move that decision to the user of the RSA module, and indeed use the
modulus as block size, in which case it would be variable and depend on the key used.
No idea how well the current crypto API copes with that, it might be a problem.

I don't know, I didn't look into the details yet. But I assume that at worst you
use a struct as key, and pass that transparently through the crypto API part.
But maybe there are better ways. Can try it out and use what seems best I suppose.

Well, you don't have much choice in the matter when using GPL software, I'm afraid.
You don't have to release it to everyone, only to your customers, but they're free
it give to anyone else they want. If that's not possible because of some NDA, then
you may not distribute the GPL code. The whole point of using GPL is that if someone
modifies the code, he's required to give back the modifications.
And squeezing out of this isn't possible in your situation as you don't have a
separate binary module, but have modified kernel code and are distributing the whole.
But I don't see why you're so mysterious about the rest anyway, because it looks rather
trivial to implement such binary signature checking thing. If it isn't trivial, then
small chance it's secure...
At least I won't ever buy "secure" hardware from any vendor who's mysterious about the
implemented protections. Because time after time it was proven that no matter how obscure
the protection is done, it's always bypassed if it couldn't stand on its own.
(Example: The GSM encryption used. Both reverse engineered and broken.)

Yes, certainly, independently from the rest of the implementation, which you might need
to move to userspace if you're really coy about it. (Though if it's only because of the
stupid NDA, then I'd consider replacing the NDA part with something of your own. NDA's
imply money drain.)
