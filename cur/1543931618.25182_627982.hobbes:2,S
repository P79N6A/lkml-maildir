Following are 7 md related patches are suitable for the next -mm
and maybe for 2.6.25.
They move towards giving user-space programs more fine control of an
array so that we can add support for more complex metadata formats
(e.g. DDF) without bothering the kernel with such things.
The last patch isn't strictly md related.  It adds an ioctl which
allows mapping from an open file descriptor on a block device to
a name in /sys.  This makes finding name of things in /sys more practical.
As I put this in block-layer code, I have Cc:ed Jens Axboe.
