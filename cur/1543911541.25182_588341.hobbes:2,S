Parag, thanks.  I reproduced this bug with your kernel config on 
2.6.23-rc3 and verified it does not happen on latest git.  I inspected 
memory after the crash and determined the problem was patching of 
instructions went awry.  Chris in the meantime fixed a bug with patching 
instructions, and the change from 100% apocalyptic failure to 100% 
unequivocal success has convinced me that was the same bug.
