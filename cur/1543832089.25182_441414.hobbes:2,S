When you say "return" do you mean "in kernel", or "return 
to userspace"?  My (possibly naive) understanding is that
one could simply s/EINTR/ERESTARTNOHAND/ for FUTEX_WAIT, in
order to achieve the change I want: for userland that 
ERESTARTNOHAND would be returned as EINTR if a signal 
handler interrupted the FUTEX_WAIT.
Cheers,
Michael
