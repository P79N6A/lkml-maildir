Ok, so I took ACPI from sf and voila: it works now! I took the patch for 2.4.20
and it does fine. Are there chances to include this in the mainstream? Without
my SIS-based motherboards do not work at all with shared interrupts (which you
actually cannot prevent due to lacking bios support for pci-irq mapping).
BTW: I tried 2.4.21-pre[1-3] and none did work, of course.
