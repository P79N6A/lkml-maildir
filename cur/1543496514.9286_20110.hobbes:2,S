What a strange discussion - people claiming that the BIOS
sets the Linux system clock, and that we need a kernel patch
because syslogd is started before hwclock is run.
Do you not have full control over the order in which you start
stuff at boot time? A 1-line change in some rc file would run
hwclock before syslog.
