I thought more about this... and looked into Documentation/Changes again
for the compiler version. All the reports at linux-kernel about timings
and kernel image size made me think, that gcc 3.x is no problem anymore.
And it seems that gcc 3.3.2 miscompiles something with my configuration. I
did a quick test using 2.95.3 today in the morning and the bootup seemed
to work.
I'm at work now, but I'll do some more tests tonight.
Sorry, that I've wasted your time, I should have known this.
If anybody is interested to track down the miscompilings, I can provide
any info needed. The least what I can do...
Thanks,
	Matze
