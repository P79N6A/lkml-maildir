Why not use C?  As long as you calibrate it, it should do just fine.  On
the other hand, since you are looping anyway, why not loop on a system
time of day call and have the loop exit when you have the required time
in hand.  These calls have microsecond resolution.

The system does these delays by looping in the task.  I.e. NO one else
gets to use the time.  I, for one, would like to see this go away.  See
: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/high-res-timers/
In any case the limit is to put "some" bound on the "time out" from
doing useful work.
If you want other times, you can always make more than one call to
nanosleep.

That is the nature of real time.  You could code your task to insure
that the father process was of higher priority.  This, of course,
assumes that you can continue to communicate with that task via, e.g. X
which is usually running SCHED_OTHER.  In other words, to keep control,
you need to have all the tasks in the communication loop at higher (or
at least equal for SCHED_RR) priority than the bad guy.

Depends.  It is certainly possible.  The question is: Can your task
stand the loss of the processor to another task?  This is what happens
at normal SCHED_OTHER priority.

Just a guess, but I would say because SCHED_OTHER tasks should not be so
time critical.
