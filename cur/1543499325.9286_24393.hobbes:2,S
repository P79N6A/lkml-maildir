Phew, at last someone else (I only kept my mouth shut to not appear too
stupid, since it _could_ be a memory error and 64M chips aren't exactly
cheap ..)
Anyway, yes, I can confirm it. Similar machine (Alpha 21164PC/533 MHz,
0.5GB RAM, 4 GB disk), but equipped with NCR53C875 using NCR/SYM8XX
driver.
That would seem to eliminate problems with the driver itself.
And the problem occured since at least 2.2.6. Oh, and I'm using GLibc
2.1, if thats of any help. Probably not.
Cheers,
Hannes
