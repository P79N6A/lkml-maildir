It couldn't merge in this case.

In the x86-64 case, If the 1k elements are not physically contigous,
I think most of them would get their own mapping.
For x86-64, if an entry ends on a 4k alignment and the next one starts
on a 4k alignment, could those be merged into one DMA segment that uses
two adjacent mapping entries?
Anyway, using a 4k FS block size (eg ext2) would be more efficient
by allowing a 1:1 of SG elements and DMA mappings.
