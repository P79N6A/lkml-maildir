You are right, I'm talking about file operations.

Ok, I think we agree that it's not a technical matter. See below for
precisions.

As I understand the problem, LTTng could technically sit either in debugfs,
procfs, sysfs, relayfs : all these (except debugfs) have been tried with the
original LTT. I just want to spare time and not go into the same debates all
over again.
The problem sits in how tracing is seen. To kernel hackers, it is seen as an
interesting kernel debugging tool, while for the vast majority of LTTng
users, it is seen as a useful system wide information gathering tool to debug
_their_ system wide problems involving programs, librairies and drivers.
Therefore, I am reluctant to put a system monitoring tool in a filesystem
clearly indicated for kernel debugging, as the main audience for LTTng is
not kernel hackers, but user space application programmers.
