OK.

Kernel compile time.

That's unfortunate.  Are the (higher level) ways in which they're used 
incompatible with CPU sets or would CPU sets be seen as being a better 
(easier) way of doing the job?
If the choice is at kernel compile time then those users of the current 
mechanism can choose it and new users can choose CPU sets.  Of course, 
this makes gradual movement from one model to the other difficult to say 
the least.

I would agree with that.  I guess that emulation would not be possible 
on top of my suggestion hence the requirement for the "fragile design" etc.
