The problem is that 
1. you have to use circular lists
2. going forward is  O(1), going backward is O(N).  This doesn't sound
   like a problem,  but deleting from lists and  alike requires you to
   go back in the list.
I guess  that if  you have lists  that you  edit a lot,  double linked
lists should be  less overhead. However, if you only  walk the lists a
lot, both models should perform equally well.
Insertion is faster, but that's the only good news..
I'm all against them, though. ;)
