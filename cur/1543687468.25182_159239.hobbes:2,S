I recommend you trying the latest Red Hat kernel from Rawhide. You can
download the kernel sources from:
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/rawhide/i386/RedHat/RPMS
look for a package called kernel-source*.rpm, download it, install it
and don't forget to run "make mrproper" before anything else.
