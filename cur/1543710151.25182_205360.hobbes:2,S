That is true.

Do you mean you want to know if the kernel's receive buffer overflows?
That could be possible in theory, but I don't know whether it's
possible with the current Linux kernels.

If the packet reaches the end host the only reason for dropping it
would be a filled receive buffer.  The size of the buffer can be set
using setsockopt().
