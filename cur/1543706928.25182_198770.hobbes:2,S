On my Dell Latitude C640 as on Peter Osterlund's laptop - blind-typing
  login/password and startx gets me a visible X desktop.
Old driver with Peter's patch works as before.
Note - this is the same laptop you tried I gave up using framebuffer on
  in the 2.4 series because after 2.4.22-pre4 it would send my screen in
  a crazed-up state (X didn't work either) [that was July 2003].
