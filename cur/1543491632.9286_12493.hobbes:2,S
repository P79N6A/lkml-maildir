Another data point:
I was getting this when I was writing an FFT program w/svgalib output and
stuff and was running it on another machine (with a sound card) while
compiling it on one with the NFS server (my dual celeron, which helped
make development a lot faster :)).  Sometimes, for no apparent reason, I'd
get "bad fh" on the client machine when tring to execute the binary and
the only way to fix it would be to leave it for about 15 seconds and then
something would expire and it would work.  If I kept trying to run it, it
would keep syaing "bad fh".  Re"make"ing it didn't do anything, either.  I
ended up putting "cd /;unmount /blah;mount /blah;cd -" into a shell alias.
The only thing I can think of that may have helped trigger it was if I
built the program while it was still running.  I tried to do this later,
though, and wasn't able to reproduce it immediately -- it happened every
30 builds or so while I was tweaking numbers in the source.
The server was my dual celeron (as I said), running unfsd 2.2beta37.  The
client was Linux 2.2.1 or something (I think, it was a while ago).  I
could try to reproduce it on 2.2.5ac2 if you'd like.
