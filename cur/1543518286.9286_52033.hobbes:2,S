I don't want to have to patch/hack libc and recompile just to use the
better syscall interface.
Imagine suddenly someone starts experimenting with a variety of
techniques and puts out kernel patches. I wouldn't want to have to
track those patches in libc as well. Too much work. I wouldn't bother
testing the kernel patches.

This sounds fragile.
