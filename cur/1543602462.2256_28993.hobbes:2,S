With this -painfully applied- patch, all seems a lot better. However, it
still seems more sluggish than 2.4.9-ac12.
Haven't bothered testing -ac13 and -ac14.
Swapping still seems to be a problem though, as this kernel happily claims
several tens of MBs of swap, and then, out of the blue, starts writing pages
out in huge blocks.
The vmstat info just disappeared from my screen, while stressing the
vm-system by doing a large parallel build, however, it showed no paging
happening during long times (20-30 secs) and then suddenly writing 30 MB in
one go.
Doesn't seem very smooth to me, where can I get my refund? :)
(if you'd like more details, please ask, I can do some testing)
Regards,
