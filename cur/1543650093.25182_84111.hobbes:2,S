I'm Having a similar problem with Mandrake 2.4.19-16mdksmp kernel...
I'm not into the mood to see applied patches, but I will try a newer
Kernel, my only complain is that I have NEVER succesfully compiled a
CD-RW capable kernel, any strong advice on that ?? , i have tried
several configurations, read tutorials, lots of kernels (vanilla an
ac's).
Best Regards
Max
