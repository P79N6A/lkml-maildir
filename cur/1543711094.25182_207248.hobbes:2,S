The first time I had to set up a CD writer to work with Linux, I checked
(what is now) the Linux Documentation Project 
http://www.tldp.org/
 which
has a nice CD-writer HOWTO document, detailing not only how you need to
configure your kernel, but also how to use the userspace tools to burn
CDs.
However, with recent kernels and tools, you don't need to (and shouldn't)
use ide-scsi to use ATAPI CD writers. cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc (assuming
that's
the correct IDE device) works just fine.
