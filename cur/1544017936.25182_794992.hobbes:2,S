Okay, I understand.

Running it while the problem is occuring will be tricky, as it only
lasts for a few seconds at a time. Is it going to be useful at all to
just see those statistics if the system is running normally?
I might need to modify the script a little. Am I right that everything
above "gathering statistics..." is pretty much static information?
I could run top, vmstat and cat /proc/sched_debug in a loop until the
problem occurs and then trim it. Something like:
while true; do
  date                                >> $FILE
  echo "-- top: --"                   >> $FILE
  top -H -c -b -d 1 -n 0.5            >> $FILE 2>/dev/null
  echo "-- vmstat: --"                >> $FILE
  vmstat                              >> $FILE 2>/dev/null
  echo "-- sched_debug #$i: --"       >> $FILE
  cat /proc/sched_debug               >> $FILE 2>/dev/null
done
That should take a snapshot every half second or so.

Kevin.
P.S. Please keep kmshanah@flexo.wumi.org.au out of the CC list (it won't
     route properly anyway). I don't know how it got added - the only
     place it would have appeared was in the "revert" commit message
     when I was testing 2.6.28 with the commit I bisected down to
     removed.
