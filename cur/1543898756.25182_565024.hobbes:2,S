Ok, so how about a CONFIG option which removes the freezer, so we can
find out experimentally how many people without it?  We can make it be
experimental at first, or (my preference) make it be the default
initially, and if people complain that their laptop's suspend feature
is broken, we can tell them how to turn back on the
CONFIG_FREEZER_DEPRECATED option.
