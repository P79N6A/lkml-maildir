Linux enables the Local APIC even on uni-processors systems so that it
can use the LOCal APIC timer.  This policy causes a significant
population of laptops to freeze when booted with ACPI enabled. 
Curiously, we've seen this failure go away on some laptops after a BIOS
upgrade -- so you shoul verify that you're running the latest BIOS for
your system.
Perhaps you could try the test patch here
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2044
and add a comment to the bug report on if it makes any difference or not.

/usr/src/MAINTAINERS lists me as the maintainer, and has this home page
for the project, which is updated periodically (tho not by me):
