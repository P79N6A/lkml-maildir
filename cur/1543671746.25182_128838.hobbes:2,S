Has been proposed many times in the context of Coda. Perhaps now that
there are 2 filesystems in the tree that want something like this we can
afford the extra int in the task structure. More likely we'll just have
to wait patiently for a credentials cache, or task ornaments, or
something might be possible with the LSM framework.

Coda has the same abomination, but we use an ioctl on a special file in
the root of the Coda tree (/coda/.CONTROL). The advantage of this is
that if we have multiple clients and mountpoints we know which client is
supposed to handle the pioctl.

We don't have anything like that, and most likely just stuffed them
into the pioctl multiplexor.

You don't want to do that anyways, it will only work reliably on a few
filesystems. ReiserFS can possibly have inode collisions which are
resolved based on the parent directory inode. ext3 only journals writes
when a filehandle is closed, so opening by inode, writing to it and
closing it doesn't trigger a journal update. ramfs and tmpfs really
don't have any usable underlying inodes that can be opened with a
device/inode number pair because there is no 'device'.
