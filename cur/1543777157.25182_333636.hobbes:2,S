Oh dang.
I thought this last crash after upgrading to 2.6.12.2 was due to the IRQ 
BALANCE issue Lars suggested, but you're saying that it's actually a whole 
different bug, though similar to the previous "prepare_write ... 
copy_from_user ... commit_write" lock problem?
Is this something new between 2.6.4-mm2 and 2.6.12.2? Or would it have 
always been present, just for some reason we're hitting it in 2.6.12 now but 
weren't hitting it in 2.6.4?
I feel we're moving backwards... :(
