Using some flag bits would work but it seems like a bit of a kludge.
Maybe the struct resource needs to have a pointer to the struct device
which owns it?  Or maybe just a `sysdata' field?

They are non-overlapping for PCI buses in the same domain.  Perhaps
the sensible thing is to have a separate resource tree for each PCI
domain (actually two trees, for I/O and memory space), and have them
contain bus addresses rather than physical addresses.  I don't know if
the generic iomem_resource and ioport_resource are still useful if we
do that.
