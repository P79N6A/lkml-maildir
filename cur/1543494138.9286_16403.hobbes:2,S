Its Non-Maskable-Interrupt. Its an interrupt line on a PC that is normally
wired to the parity error signals off the memory, but on some PC's used
for power management.
Run some big heavy jobs for a few hours (eg kernel builds) - if you get
sig11 errors or other random odd oopses then the NMI may be significant
if not cross your fingers ..
