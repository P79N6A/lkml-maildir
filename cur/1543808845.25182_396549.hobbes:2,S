I tried that. Mostly, writing failed. At cdrwtool's end, it looked like this:
using device /dev/cdrw
fixed packets
setting speed to 10
write file /root/udftest.img
4690KB internal buffer
setting write speed to 10x
writing at lba = 0, blocks = 32
wait_cmd: Input/output error
Command failed: 2a 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 00 00 00 - sense 05.24.00
At kernel's end:
cdrom: This disc doesn't have any tracks I recognize!
Once I, somehow, managed to write it. However, writing ISO9660 (yes, I know
that iso9660 doesn't support read/write; I use it for test though and I need
it working), attempt to read it returned this:
attempt to access beyond end of device
hdc: rw=0, want=68, limit=4
isofs_fill_super: bread failed, dev=hdc, iso_blknum=16, block=16
