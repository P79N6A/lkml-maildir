Subject: PATCH: Zip drive sync bug fixed (WAS Re: I can kill 2.2.2 with my zip drive)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/3/7/50

The patch below is from Andrea Arcangeli.  It fixes the bug that I
reported that causes a kernel panic while attempting to sync to my
parallel port zip drive.  It also seems to give a performance
improvement when writing to the drive, but I haven't had time to
benchmark it yet.
Thanks to Andrea and David Campbell for sorting this one out.  I also
think Alan was involved somewhere, so thanks to him too.  It would be
great if this patch (or something like it) could go in for 2.2.3.
