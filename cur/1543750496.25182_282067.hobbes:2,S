Hi Marcelo,
1.  Actually, my patch above loops every 5s to reduce screen clutter,
    whereas the original 2.4 patch (cited by Andreas Unterkircher) loops
    every 1s.  Both loops forever.
    But, if a limit of 10 tries is what you want, then here is a patch
    for 2.6.10:
====================

+		break;
 	}
 	panic("VFS: Unable to mount root fs on %s", __bdevname(ROOT_DEV, b));
 out:
====================
    The only difference are
	- using 'tryagain' instead of 'tries' as counter
	- printing countdown of seconds like
	    VFS: Waiting 9sec for root device...
	    VFS: Waiting 8sec for root device...
	    ...
	    VFS: Waiting 1sec for root device...
	  before printing the final error.
2.  I sincerely hope that this patch get included in the main kernel.
    USB boot is very important feature, and will become the standard way
    of booting Linux thin-client as well as other Linux system, embedded
    or not.  It will make Netboot, Etherboot, PXE boot, CF-to-IDE
    adapter, and initrd all obsolete.
