I guess I cut and pasted too much directories, sorry. I attached the file
since it's small.

A little more, we also have to make sure not to miss events and the
__wait_event interfaces addersses that second issue.

Good, thanks!

After reading the two NMI dumps and the assembler of the .text.lock
section of the vmlinux ELF image I think I found it.
It seems a regular SMP lock inversion in the DAC960 driver that is
acquiring the waitqueue_lock with the io_request_lock still acquired. Here
the trace that I deducted:
	CPU0					CPU1
	------------------			---------------
	spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock)
	DAC9xx_request_fn()
						wake_up(something...)
						read_lock(&waitqueue_lock)
						aic7xxx_irq_handler()
	DAC9xx_WaitForCommand()
	add_to_wait_queue(something....)
	write_lock_irqsave(&waitqueue_lock)
	/* hanging because of the read_lock
	   on the other side */
						spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock)
						/* hanging because it's
						   acquired from the other
						   side */
				/* DEADLOCK */
Here the fix (uncompiled and untested):
