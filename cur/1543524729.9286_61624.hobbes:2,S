: Yes, there is a basic tension between the way I do things (lists
: that I like to sort in order to remove duplicates) and the way
: Linus does things (making the link order significant as of 2.3.15).
: 
: Linus wins.  :)
In the for what it is worth department: if you sort then the patches 
generated from release to release are smaller.  I've been tracking the kernel
for a while with BitKeeper and it is apparent that part of the patch size
is just random reordering of the dependencies.  
I don't care if it is sorted order or some other order as long as there is
a deterministic order.
