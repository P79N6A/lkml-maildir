Normal tcp queues (in this case, since a single scp is enough
to trigger the bug)
If a rx buffer was allocated using GFP_DMA, then b44_rx()
should copy it to a new skb, (like done by copybreak algo),
regardless of frame size, to not consume DMA memory in protocol
queues.
Better be slow (because of extra copy) then risking exhausting DMA zone
easy way to test would be to redefine RX_COPY_THRESHOLD to 16000
