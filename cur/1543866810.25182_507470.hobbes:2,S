It needs to be at most 2 seconds while down or it's going to miss some of the state changes, why bother to output all the types of state if you're going to ignore some of them?
As for while it's up, polling more often has a negligible effect on performance (still polling every 200ms here). If you change the timing for different states, you should know that it won't go into the down state on a retrain so ~up should enable faster polling.
