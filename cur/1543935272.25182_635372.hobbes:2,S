    x86: validate against ACPI motherboard resources
...
recently added to git-x86 causes one of my Intel test systems to not boot 
unless I specify pci=conf1.
...
ACPI: EC: Look up EC in DSDT
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)
ACPI: Using IOAPIC for interrupt routing
PCI: MCFG configuration 0: base 4026531840 segment 0 buses 0 - 127
PCI: MCFG area at f0000000 reserved in ACPI motherboard resources
PCI: Using MMCONFIG at f0000000 - f7ffffff
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (0000:00)
<hang> 
The system is a SDV, but I believe production level.
DSDT is available at 
http://firstfloor.org/~andi/dsdt.dsl
On previous kernels the MCFG was rejected because it wasn't e820 reserved:
ACPI: bus type pci registered
PCI: BIOS Bug: MCFG area at f0000000 is not E820-reserved
PCI: Not using MMCONFIG.
PCI: Using configuration type 1
Also I'm a little surprised to find my Signed-off-by on that patch.
