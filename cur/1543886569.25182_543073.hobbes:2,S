That's not a terribly useful changelog, sorry.  I look at the patch and I
don't know what was wrong with the old code, nor how this new code improves

"disable_irq_wake call must be symmetric with enable_irq_wake".  hmm, OK,
I'll take your word for it.
Does the present code actually fail in some manner, or what?
