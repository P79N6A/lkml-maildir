I had a patch for 2.4.something which would allow you to configure which 
processes were killed first by the OOM killer. You basically gave 
processes an oom_nice value, either by pid or process name, and that was 
  taken into account by the oom killer. You could also protect a process 
completely from the oom killer, which would be good to do for your sshd 
process in the example you give.
