I don't know for sure and for that reason alone, I'd rather not change
the meaning of ARCH_PFN_OFFSET as part of a "fix".

Lets close this out first and then figure out where to go next.  The following
patch should fix the problem where mem_map is offset twice when ARCH_PFN_OFFSET
!= 0 and documents what ARCH_PFN_OFFSET is for.
