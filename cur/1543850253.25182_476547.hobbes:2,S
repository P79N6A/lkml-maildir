Unionfs used to do the same thing, until we decided that it was better to do
it some other way. (We went with a work queue approach.)
Hrm. How do you do DAC checks if you don't copy over the permissions without
alteration?
I'm wondering, why don't just you duplicate all the attributes of the files
(including xattrs)? That would take care of most if not all the DAC/MAC
issues, no?

In our case it works well, however we have only very specific times when we
need to use the work queue, so the performance hit doesn't hurt us as much
as it would hurt you - I'm assuming you'd be using the thread for a sizable
portion of calls you get.

I'm thinking that it would be nice to combine the caching related security
code with those for stackable filesystems. I realize that there may not
really be many things that need to have LSM hooks, but stackable filesystems
should be something to keep in mind now that ecryptfs is in (and hopefully
Unionfs will follow shortly :) ). The SELinux guys would probably know
what's needed.

Umm...this sounds little bit too hacky (and a fair amount of code would have
to get changed.) I'd prefer a more general solution that applies to more
than just caching.
