Subject: i810fb compile/module loading failure on 2.5.66-bk12

When trying to load module i810 on 2.5.66-bk12 I get:
i810fb: Unknown symbol __memcpy
It also happens (in a bit different way) when I try to link it while
compiling directly into kernel.
I fixed it by changing
            memcpy_toio(d_addr, s_addr, s_pitch * image->height);
on drivers/video/i810/i810_accel.c:419 to:
            memcpy(d_addr, s_addr, s_pitch * image->height);
I have no idea what I've just done but... it works for me. :-)
