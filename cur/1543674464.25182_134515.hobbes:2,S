   Despite whatever political wrangling there is between userspace and
   kernelspace implementations (and some very valid points about other
   arches), there is still a dearth of testing, as far as I can see.
I've never in my life heard the argument that we kept something
in the kernel that didn't belong there due to "userland testing".
That's a bogus argument.
When I ripped RARP out of the kernel, we didn't immediately have
a replacement, but one showed up shortly.  So what?
And in this ase we already have Arjan's stuff.  So start testing
his code instead of whining about keeping the current stuff in
the tree.
