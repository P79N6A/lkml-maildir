I.e. you get per-attribute rules (fsckloads of them) and no way to tell
what do the attributes apply to unless you know the rules for given attribute.

Oh, I understand what you are proposing (hell, I've mentioned that variant
in the first posting).  The trouble is not with being able to implement it.
I just don't like having no relationship between the syntax and operations
on types, that's all.  gcc variant, nasty as it is for our needs, at least
has that consistent.  IOW, you can get from declaration to type structure
without knowing what each attribute does.  Seeing that gcc rules are
weird enough to be confusing, at least having that weirdness clearly
indicated by __attribute__() instead of recalling which attribute is gcc-like
and which is not...
