Yes, btime stays now constant. But to make ps work right, I replaced all uses of
variable Hertz in ps source (procps 2.0.18) with constant 100.0172.
After uptime 4 h 42 min, the error is already 3 seconds in the default ps,
and ./ps which is the "fixed" one, displays the right start time.

So the problem is the inaccuracy of HZ.
