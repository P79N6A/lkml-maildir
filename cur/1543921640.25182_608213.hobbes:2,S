No it doesn't. Strange interpretations of peculiar US laws may be doing
that. Thats [with Linux community hat on] _not_our_problem_.

Send patches.

Corporations practice "liability dumping" so that would be expected. They
want to dumb liability onto their suppliers, their customers and anyone
else they can find. Its the logical commercial practice faced by any
rational body evolving in the US marketplace.
But thats still their issue, no the community's issue.
