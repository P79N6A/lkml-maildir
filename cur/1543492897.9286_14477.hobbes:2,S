this is close to the way that i originally implemented it, although i
tried with two tables (first and third byte indexed one table, middle byte
indexed the second table), and with three tables.
my random tables were constructed such that, for a 256 entry random table,
the table contained unique random values from 0 to 255.  making these 16
bit numbers would only add some hash tablesize flexibility, but i don't
believe it would help the hash function generate better randomness.

i didn't find it to be real critical for the real data i was hashing.

the multiplicative hash function i created uses 3 instructions in less
than 16 bytes, consumes a fixed number of CPU cycles, and uses no memory
bandwidth (except instruction fetches) to compute the hash value.  my goal
was to reduce memory references, cache pollution and evictions, i.e.
making the hash function more memory-bandwidth friendly (since this is of
prime concern on big iron), and making a reasonable bucket size
distribution to lower the average lookup time.
on a CPU of older architecture, i don't think the buffer hash will be a
significant performance bottleneck, so adding a single integer
multiplication in that path will probably not be an issue.  if it is, use
the old hash function.
