To quote from init/main.c:
	/*
	 * check if there is an early userspace init.  If yes, let it do all
	 * the work
	 */
So yes, it is by design.  Assembling arrays with mdadm gives you a
lot more control than the kernel-autodetect so as you have an
initramfs, it is a good idea to make use of it.
If you *really* want to use the autodetect functionality, you can look
around for a program called 'raidautorun'.  It does triggers the
autodetect function from userspace.
