Indeed, that does the trick, thanks for the suggestion.  So I can be
quite confident, now, that my RAM is sane and it's just that the BIOS
doesn't initialize it properly.
But I'd still like some way of filling the RAM when Linux starts (or
perhaps in the bootloader), because letting memtest86 run after every
cold reboot isn't a very satisfactory solution.
Happy hacking,
