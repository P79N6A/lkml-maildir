No, transport class is its name.  Think about a standard object-oriented 
paradigm.  Each transport has unique characteristics.  The proper place 
to export these and manage these characteristics is the transport layer, 
as SAM agrees.  The manifestation of the transport layer is the 
transport class.
You have to look beyond the current code, to see this.
An implementation of a transport class, in conjunction with helper 
functions common to all transports (SCSI core), combines to form the 
transport layer for a specific transport.

SCSI core is nothing but a set of helper functions and support code that 
enable the transport class and LLDD to implement the transport layer.

Strongly disagree.  This invention is defined by -needs-, as is other 
code in Linux.  If we have new needs, we change the code.

That's fine, since its an internal kernel API.
