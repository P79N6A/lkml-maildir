  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.3.1 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v130 and devfs-patch-v99.7 (or later).
NOTE: The new "MODLOAD" action is now the recommended way to load
modules. Don't use the "EXECUTE" action for this anymore.
The main changes are:
- added "MODLOAD" action
- install default configuration file if /etc/devfsd.conf doesn't
  exist.
				Regards,
					Richard....
