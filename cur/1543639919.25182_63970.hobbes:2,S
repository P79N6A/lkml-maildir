Well, I think when the switch does not change any behavior, it's actually
okay to get it over with in one large but trivial patch. The other 
approach would be to give the new syntax the new behavior, and do the 
actual switch piecemeal, checking and fixing dep_* statements as they get 
converted.
It'd be nice to introduce a warning for statements where the old syntax is
used, but that seems not possible at least in Configure, since I think 
statements like
dep_tristate '...' CONFIG_FOO m
should remain valid.

Well, it's a bug.
Setting CONFIG_QUUX to "y" when CONFIG_FOO is "n" can be done in
an else clause to the if statement. If you want to set a default, that's 
what defconfig is for.
What's nice is that you identified so many problematic cases already, so 
fixing shouldn't be hard. It may still make sense to add code to 
"Configure" which recognizes a redefinition and complains or even aborts.
