Nope! I have the 6629. Actually, the patch you have for NV solved the
pgd_offset problem. But I'm amazed that you didn't get into the
may_sleep calls.  In the nvidia code os-interface.c, would call hooks
into the kernel with interrupts turned off and hit the may_sleep.  But
looking into it further now, one of the crashes came from
ioremap_nocache and the sleep happened in kmem_cache_alloc. So maybe
Ingo fixed this.  I lied earlier (not intentionally), the last kernel I
tried with the NVidia was V0.7.32-18, so let me try again.
Thanks, for the references though.
