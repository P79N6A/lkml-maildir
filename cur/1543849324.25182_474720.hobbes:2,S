ioctls are probably wrong here though.  Ideally, you would want to be 
able to support an SMP guest.  This means you need to have two virtual 
processors executing in kernel space.  If you use ioctls, it forces you 
to have two separate threads in userspace.  This would be hard for 
something like QEMU which is currently single threaded (and not at all 
thread safe).
If you used a read/write interface, you could poll for any number of 
processors and handle IO emulation in a single userspace thread (which 
seems closer to how hardware really works anyway).
