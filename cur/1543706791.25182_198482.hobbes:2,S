The Debian maintainer released a new package today with the following change
log entry:
* Reenabled INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX_ENABLE (closes: #232267, #232269).
Now everything works again.
So it looks like this might have been a SNAFU... Unless the other guy
experiencing problems is not using the Debian kernel packages.
Sorry for not passing along that i was using a pre-compiled binary.
