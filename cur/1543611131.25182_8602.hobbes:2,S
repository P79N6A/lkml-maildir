Are there currently any kernel hooks to support Magic Lantern?
Basically, a "tee" to capture all network packets and pass them
on to a filtering task without affecting normal network activity.
It's like `tcpdump`, but allows packets to be inserted into the
output queue as well without affecting normal network activity.
Yes, I know a module could be written, but I wonder if the
capability already exists.
