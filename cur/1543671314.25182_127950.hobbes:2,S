I was thinking of hard disk motors...  Actually, some of those would
be 3600 r.p.m., so if we used a large capstan, we might be in with a
chance :-).  (You'd really need to drive the actual reels as well,
though, I can't see us starting and stopping the whole thing very
quickly just using the capstan motor.)
