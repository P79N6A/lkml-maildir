I'm currently using:
        {
                .mfr_id         = 0x00b0,
                .dev_id         = 0x00b0,
                .name           = "Collie hack",
                .uaddr          = {
                        [0] = MTD_UADDR_UNNECESSARY,    /* x8 */
                },
                .DevSize        = SIZE_4MiB,
                .CmdSet         = P_ID_INTEL_STD,
                .NumEraseRegions= 1,
                .regions        = {
                        ERASEINFO(0x10000,64),
                }
        },
...so I should use ERASEINFO(0x40000,16)?

I do not have collie with me right now.
