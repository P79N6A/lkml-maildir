ok it's me again. i got how priority queuing works. and
this is quite strange for the moment. when using 2 or 3
queues everything works like said in the docu. with 4
queues it gets wired. blow there's a list where the 
different user priorities in the VTID go:
2 queues:
---------
queue 0:	priorities: 0, 1, 2, 3, untagged framges
queue 1:	priorities: 4, 5, 6, 7
3 queues:
---------
queue 0:	priorities: 0, 1, 2, 3, untagged framges
queue 1:	priorities: 4, 5
queue 2:	priorities: 6, 7
4 queues:
---------
queue 0:	priorities: 1, 2
queue 1:	priorities: 0, 3, untagged framges
queue 2:	priorities: 4, 5
queue 3:	priorities: 6, 7
the step from 3 to 4 queues is quite amuseing.
