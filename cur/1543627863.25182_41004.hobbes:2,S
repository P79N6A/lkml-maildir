Also, it looks like the Athlon MP still stacks up quite nice in his more or
less real world benchmark, even against an pair of Hyperthreaded ZEON's.

I'll bet it'll be interesting, and I agree, I was dubious about the P4 at
first anyway.. :o)  Though Hyperthreading will only be in the ZEON.

From the docs, it looks like maybe some scheduling smarts could be added.
Run Floating point ops on one Logical processor, and normal ops on the
other, and maybe some other parallelism mods.
