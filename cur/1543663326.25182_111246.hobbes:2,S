Hmm interesting, nothing comes to mind right now. I'll try vcdxrip
myself, please tell me how you typically invoke it to produce the bug.
The best approach for 2.5.x and later is to use the SG_IO ioctl. It's
similar in spirit to CDROM_SEND_PACKET, but much faster. CDROMREADMODE2
should work too, of course.
