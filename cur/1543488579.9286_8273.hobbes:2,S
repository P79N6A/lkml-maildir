But why does it matter? Safe-delete is hardly a critical facility:
it's just there to protect you from doing silly things like:
% rm fred *
I'm not even convinced it belongs anywhere except in a replacement
utility for rm(1). It doesn't seem critical for other programmes. And
it's definately not critical for *all* programmes.
The only other place outside of rm(1) I can see it being useful is
inside a GUI like a file manager. In which case it's new code and I
don't think we have to worry about static binaries (statically linked
GUIs are bloatware, especially if they come as part of a desktop
environment, where you get lots of copies of the same code).
