hi list,
keyboard disappears with 2.4.x kernel on notebook (compaq amarda)
After some time the keyboard from my amarda notebook does not respond to anything. The only hint is that 
"keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?" appears
quit often in the syslog before the kbd stops working.
Comparing the 2.2.x code (no problems) with the 2.4.x code i found pckbd_leds() as prime suspect.
as you can see it sets kbd_exists = 0 (FALSE) after sending an ENABLE. I am not sure if this is my probleme (read: no time to check if this fix works) but i guess its wrong. 
Note: 
1. the error isnt easy reproduceable but appears only with the 2.4.x 
2. send_data returns 1 for  acknowledge  else 0 
3. kann sombody please document kbd_exists ?

org:
void pckbd_leds(unsigned char leds)
{
        if (kbd_exists && (!send_data(KBD_CMD_SET_LEDS) || !send_data(leds))) {
                send_data(KBD_CMD_ENABLE);      /* re-enable kbd if any errors *
/
                kbd_exists = 0;
        }
}
my idea:
 if () {
	   if (send_data(KBD_CMD_ENABLE)){
        printk(KERN_WARNING "Keyboard off-line ?!\n");
		kbd_exists = FALSE;
		}
	}
