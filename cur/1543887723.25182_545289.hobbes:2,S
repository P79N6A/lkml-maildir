8250_early.c does basically the same thing as the serial part of
early_printk.c, so we should be able to make it work just as early.
I don't remember why I didn't use early_param() for 8250_early;
I probably should have.  On ia64, it doesn't matter because we call
early_serial_console_init() explicitly at about the time of
parse_early_param().
8250_early and early_printk are so similar, I just don't see the
need for both.
