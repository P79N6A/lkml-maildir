Does it come up often? Well, I have a sourceforge project setup and am
currently only waiting on finalizing how it's going to be done. So we have
about proved the first possibility wrong, and if you ever hear anything else
about this in a while, we will have proved the second wrong too. Soo, while
we are at it, ill say, that if anyone wants to help with it, email me. We
especialy need people that either have ideas on how to do this or have a
good knowledge of the kernel, mainly memory, processes, and initilization.
