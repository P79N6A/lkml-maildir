Sometimes it's even impossible, e.g. if choice values are involved. It can 
get even more complex, as a config symbol can be defined multiple times 
and the dependencies belong to the prompt not to the symbol. Letting 
select look at all the dependencies, would let the complexity explode.
Right now the simplest solution is to either let A select everything or B 
uses select instead of depends.
