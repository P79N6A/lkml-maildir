Agreed, and allow me to take an even more radical position:
I've long felt that things like snapshotting and mirroring made a lot of 
sense at the filesystem level -- as do layered filesystems, just like we 
layer block devices.
Block device drivers (MD, DM) get ever more complicated, and ultimately 
become mini-filesystems themselves.  The metadata managed by blkdev 
drivers continues to increase in complexity.  What is represented to the 
upper layer as a contiguous run of bytes is really, under the hood, 
chunks of data coalesced logically -- just like files in a filesystem.
The more complex that blkdev drivers become, the more and more they will 
look like filesystems.
