Subject: CPU affinity problem?

I have dual CPU machine on which I run two niced crack processes.
If I send SIGSTOP  to one of the two processes,  the remaining crack process
keeps bounces  quite between  the two  CPUs (as shown  by the  CPU0_Nice and
CPU1_Nice bars in  procmeter3), so as to  give almost the same  load on each
CPU
I thought that because of CPU affinity, my remaining process was going to be
assigned to the same  CPU (at least as long as there  isn't enough non niced
work to keep the other CPU busy)
Is this expected behavior for the scheduler?
(I am running on 2.2.7)
Thanks,
Marc
