It is an Unix clone for Commodore 64. Nice to hear there are still
people working with the good old C64.
Or did you maybe mean Linux? You can get the kernel source from
http://www.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
If you are new to Linux you shouldn't get that but instead a complete
GNU/Linux distribution, like Red Hat:
