Subject: Dynamic TCP reserved ports allocated in which range?

Hi List(s)
For a firewall setup I need to know in which range applications like
rsh, or better yet the rresvport() libc function allocate reserved ports.
Do I have to expect ports in the whole 1..1024 range (maybe omitting those
already in use by other servers) or is only a limited range used (like
512-1023).
Thanks in advance,
Michael.
P.S.
Yes, I know I shouldn't allow such things through a firewall, but I have
to (at least for now) and it's also not into the internet but only between
internal departments.
