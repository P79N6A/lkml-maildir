We don't enter unless there is something for RCU to do (might be a
pending callback, for example, but might also be needing to acknowledge
a counter flip).  If, by the time we get to rcu_try_flip_idle(), there
is no longer anything to do (!rcu_pending()), we bail.
So a given CPU kicks the state machine out of idle only if it -still-
has something to do once it gets to rcu_try_flip_idle(), right?

Good question.  I believe so, because the extra stages don't require
much additional processing, and because the ratio of rcu_read_lock()
calls to the number of grace periods is extremely high.  But, if I
can prove it is safe, I will certainly decrease GP_STAGES or otherwise
optimize the state machine.

Indeed!  The current version is quite a bit different than my early-2005
posting (which relied on locks!), and a -lot- of people had a hand in
making it what it is today.
