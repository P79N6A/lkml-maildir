The busybox binary does have differences - I think that the -n parameter
is required to set the mode 'right now'.  But I'm glad that the
mode change works (thats the tough part).  Probably something changed
in the way we handle the setup and/or the mode database, thats easy enough
to instrument and fix.  I'll check this out tomorrow, and do a patch for
the blanking bug too.
