I can't play audio CD's with 2.2.0-final. 
I have a 
        hdc: Dysan CD-32Xi, ATAPI CDROM drive
        Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.52
which is correctly detected on boot up i.e. no options to lilo.
I can mount and umount _data_ CDs without any problem, but when I try to
play an audio CD (using cdtool-2.1.5) I get a nodisc error (ioctl).
Similarly eject gives
        eject: CDROMEJECT ioctl failed for `/dev/hdc': Operation not
        supported on transport endpoint 
I've tried various other cdplayer (workman, workbone, playcd) and these all
fail. 
Also I've checked the source for cdtool and changed the lines opening
/dev/cdrom to O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK, but without any success.
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <linux/cdrom.h>
int main(void)
{
  int fd;
  fd = open("/dev/cdrom", O_RDONLY | O_NONBLOCK);
  printf("fd %d\n", fd);
  printf("Result %d\n", ioctl(fd, CDROMEJECT));
  return 0;
}
gives
        fd 3
        Result -1
This same program works ok on 2.0.36
        fd 3
        Result -1
Also 
> cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info
drive name:             hdc
drive speed:            0
drive # of slots:       0

Suggestions?
I've checked the archive for this list and there was a similar problem
discussed in the thread
        [PATCH] pre8/asm-i386/string.h + de4x5 -> no go
but there didn't seem to be any resolution.
I follow the archives, but can't take the whole list, so can replies to this
message be CC'd to me at
        ian@nasoftwr.demon.co.uk
Thanks.
