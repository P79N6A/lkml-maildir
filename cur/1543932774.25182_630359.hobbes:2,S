Dear Jens.
Is this code scheduled for 2.6.25? I cannot find it in mm tree.
Because above code conflicts with the scsi_data_buffer patch,
that is in mm tree and I hope will get accepted into 2.6.25.
Now the concepts are not at all conflicting, only that they
both bang in the same places.
(And by the way it does not apply on scsi-misc either.
And it did not compile in your tree, a missing bit in 
ide-scsi.c)
I have rebase and fixed your code on top of scsi_data_buffer patchset.
Please review. (Patchset posted as reply to this mail)
They are totaly untested, based on -mm tree.
We should decide the order of these patches and rebase
accordingly.
AND ...
Please send, to-be-included-in-next-kernel patches to Morton. 
This way we can account for them. Also I do not see Ack-by: 
of the scsi maintainer in the scsi bits of your patches.
Is it not a costume to Ack-on bits that belong to other maintainers, 
even for maintainers?
