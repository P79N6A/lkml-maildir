I don't believe a cylinder of wasted disk space is significant.  I don't 
believe a cylinder of disk is worth adding the complexity of sharing a 
partition to a filesystem.  That complexity translates into engineering 
time and mistakes.
Your other arguments for making a hole in the filesystem, based on 
tradition, are more convincing.
