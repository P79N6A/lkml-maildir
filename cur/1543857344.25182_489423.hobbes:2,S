Based on the discussion with Jesper, we fall back to regular behaviour. 
  (Or possibly hang or reboot, if we added another switch).

No overcommit only protects the system as a whole, not any particular 
processes.  The purpose of this is to protect specific daemons from 
being killed when the system as a whole is short on memory.  Same 
rationale as for oomadj, but different knob to twiddle.
