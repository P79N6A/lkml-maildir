I should clarify, this was with a webserver benchmark.
For those who want to use them, Maneesh's dcache_rcu-12 patch and my
RCU "performance" infrastructure patches are in -
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8875&release_id=111743
The latest release is 2.5.36-mm1.
rcu_ltimer and read_barrier_depends are pre-requisites for dcache_rcu.
Thanks
