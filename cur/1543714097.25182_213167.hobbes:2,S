   Ok, I took a look.  The open/write/read/close interface seems to be
the best approach.  It shouldn't be too hard, except the read/write
interfaces don't pass in the attribute pointer like they do for the
show/store interface.  Is this a bug?
   A nice feature of the current implementation is that I have one show
function that reads the method name out of the attribute structure. 
With the bin_file interface, I'd need to have a different read/write
function for every possible method on a kobject.  I also lose the
convenience of being able extend the container structure to meet my
needs.  Am I strecthing the use of the bin_file too far or should these
interfaces pass the attribute pointer?  Thanks,
	Alex
