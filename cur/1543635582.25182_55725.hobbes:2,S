Yes, any of the changes need to make the dynamic value available to
programs. Alas, too many programs grab the HZ value and compile it in, and
don't work right on a kernel with a modified rate. I don't know if the
CLK_TCK macro is dynamic or not, I sure hope so.
I'd like to see it set at boot time, and available in /proc/sys for easy
use by scripts. As noted by others, there are a lot of uses in the kernel
source which assume that arithmetic will happen at compile time, and even
if you ignore the overhead it would take a lot of rewriting to make it
dynamic. Setting it a boot time gets most of the gain and none of the
pain (boot time = pick a kernel, not a parameter).
