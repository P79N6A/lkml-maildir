hm, if i only knew. i don't know how long it took the other night to go
from "normal" to "OOM". but today, with 2.6.11-rc5-bk2 (well, yesterday
actually) i was working normally, and all of a sudden swap goes from 170MB
used swap (normal) to OOM. i think it took a minute or so, but i just
can't tell which application went nuts. today the first process that got
killed was "ssh-agent", the other day it was mysqld. but even after this,
it should've released some memory, right? but the oom-killer goes on and
on and kills the next task.
i'll monitor memory usage tonight and see what it gives. these "pppd"
messages are suspicious though.
thank you,
Christian.
