what about a playing CD?  the analog audio outs on the cd are hooked
up to the analog bits of the ac97.  maestro.c currently has no way
of knowing if that stuff is making noise or not.  now, if you add
_output_ mixers being zeroed to the requirement then you can safely
power down everyone involved.

If this could be made reliable I'd be all for it :)  I'd worry about
sketchy drives.  I know the drive in my laptop does very wacky things
