Subject: [PATCH] get_nodes mask miscalculation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

It appears there is a nodemask miscalculation in the get_nodes()
function in mm/mempolicy.c.  This bug has two effects:
1. It is impossible to specify a length 1 nodemask.
2. It is impossible to specify a nodemask containing the last node.
The following patch against 2.6.8-rc3 has been confirmed to solve
both problems.
