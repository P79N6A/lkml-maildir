It's the only one in the log file of that machine. I think it didn't die

Newer means 2.4.21pre, since we are running 2.4.20?
I assume that we will not upgrade the kernel before a new stable 
release, since it is - should be - a production environment.
We have some indications, that our whole problem might be related to 
kernel NFS and mixing between 2.2.21 and 2.4.20 in both directions.
I'll compile some more oopses and give you a report tomorrow.
Have a nice day,
Christopher
