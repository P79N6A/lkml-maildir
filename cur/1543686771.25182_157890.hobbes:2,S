For a coder, perhaps. This user however is facing what feels like a
fundamental flaw. The doubling of boot time was fixed, but game-test is
pretty much as it was in pure O16 (impossible) and Blender is equally
bad - now even the mouse pointer vanishes, becomes invisible, during the
10+ second pauses. And it is with Blender as only app running. Didn't
dare to start xmms...
I'll keep running the 2.6.0-test3 ---> O16.2int though. Might pick up
other cases of regression in lighter usage.
