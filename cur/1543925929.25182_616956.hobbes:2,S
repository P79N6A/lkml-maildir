Ah, I forgot about that. Will do as soon as I get a working kernel again. 
I'm in the middle of git-bisecting and I had to mark the last 2 versions 
as "bad" but only because they 1) Oopsed during boot or 2) could not load 
the kernel image:
-------------------------------------
# git-bisect log

# bad: [c223701cf6c706f42840631c1ca919a18e6e2800] ide: add "hdx=nodma" kernel parameter

0) was at 2.4.24-rc2 or so
1) Oops during bootup, but not NFS related, IIRC
2) Grub could not load the kernel: "linux 'zimage' kernel too big, try
    'make bzImage'". Maybe related to the x86/i386 merge?
-------------------------------------
I've built these kernels like so:
  # make mrproper
  # cp ~/config.2.6.23.1 .config
  # yes '' | make oldconfig
  # make
  # sudo cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map /boot/2.6/
  # sudo make modules_install
Marking versions as "bad" because of unrelated stuff might poison the 
results somehow, or make them unusable again. Hm...
@Mathieu: I'll try LTTng later on, many thanks for the hint!
Christian.
