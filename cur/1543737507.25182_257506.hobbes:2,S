I'm inclined to agree. I should have titled the thread "libata/md badness" 
since it appears to be a raid atop sata issue. Raid5 apparently works over 
scsi, though.
This is really beyond my realm of knowledge, though. After I check my 
drives for errors, I'm going to back up my array and then experiment a 
bit. I'll post any oopses I find in hopes that someone will be able to 
properly interpret them.
