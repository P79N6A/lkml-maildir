Are you sure that `yes' actually is getting stopped?  In the sense of,
"No more y's appear."  Because the T state also occurs normally for a
traced process (when it makes a syscall, it gets stopped and the
debugger/tracer gets to poke it around for a while until it allows it to
resume).
If it really does get stopped, it could be because strace is hanging
somewhere.  You might try tracing strace and see what it's up to.
You might also consider trying the Debian strace, which has quite a few
recent changes wrt 3.1.0.1.
