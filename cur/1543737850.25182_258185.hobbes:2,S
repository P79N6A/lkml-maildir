CPL0 solution is certainly more localized, but I have hard problems
to convice myself that it is actually safe.
I would appreciate if you could add comments what values are set
by ESPFIX_SWITCH_16 + 8 + 4 and simillar moves, and what they actually
do.  And convicing myself that ESPFIX_SWITCH_32 has just right value so
pushl %eax
pushl %es
lss ESPFIX_SWITCH_32,%esp
popl %es
popl %eax
actually works took almost an hour...
