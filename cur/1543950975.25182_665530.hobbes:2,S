ok, that's rather convincing.
the generic version in lib/find_next_bit.c is open-coded C which gcc can 
optimize pretty nicely.
the hand-coded assembly versions in arch/x86/lib/bitops_32.c mostly use 
the special x86 'bit search forward' (BSF) instruction - which i know 
from the days when the scheduler relied on it has some non-trivial setup 
costs. So especially when there's _small_ bitmasks involved, it's more 
expensive.

i'm not surprised that the hand-coded assembly versions had a bug ...
[ this means we have to test it quite carefully though, as lots of code 
  only ever gets tested on x86 so code could have built dependency on 
  the buggy behavior. ]

i'd not worry about that too much. Have you tried to build with:
  CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y
  CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=y
(the latter only available in x86.git)

i've picked it up into x86.git, lets see how it goes in practice.
