I don't know how seriously you desire me to take your comment, so 
forgive me if I take it too seriously.
You can't upgrade existing APIs to handle sets of inodes without 
changing them in ways that require source code modification, so one can 
presume that the app writer used the new APIs as correctly as he 
performs all his other changes to his code.
Agreed?
Of course, bash would be much more secure if we got rid of globbing (*), 
yes?  Ted, can you write and send a patch in to the bash maintainer for 
that?    ;-)
