Yes, precisely.  This requirement has been documented in
SubmittingPatches for several months now.  More details here:

Casey, *please* don't submit a patch for a system call without also
providing a test program, and some attempt at userspace documentation.
 (Andi already pointed this out.  From my POV, I don't need you to
write a full blown man page -- if you send me the text, I'll do the
*roff stuff.  But that text should accompany the patch that implements
the syscall.)
Cheers,
Michael
