The problem is that put_device must not be called while holding a
spinlock.  This has always been true, but we only started noticing it
recently when Greg added a might_sleep.  Your klist method would call
put_device while holding the klist's spinlock.

Good, I thought so.

That was not my assumption.  My assumption was that the routine called by
the iterator will _sometimes_ do the final put on the object.  I don't
know if that actually ever happens, but the possibility certainly exists.  
For example, there are places where a device_for_each_child iteration is
used for calling device_unregister on all the children.

Agreed.  Note, however, that the patch doesn't do this for all objects -- 
only for struct device.

Not so.  A device structure can't be freed before device_del returns, and
the patch makes device_del call klist_remove instead of klist_del.  The
difference between the two is that klist_remove blocks until all iterators
have finished using the klist node.  New iterators can't start using it
because the routine removes the node from the klist.
So by the time device_del returns, we are guaranteed that the embedded 
klist node is not in use and will never be used.  Thus releasing the 
device structure is safe.
