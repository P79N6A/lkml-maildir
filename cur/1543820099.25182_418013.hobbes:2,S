Well remap_pfn_range / io_remap_pfn_range is a good option, but it
shouldn't really support get_user_pages so I suspect you are just
lucky there (ie. on some platforms you might not have a struct page
for your bus address, and other times the final put_page will try
to free the page).
If you definitely have struct pages, vm_insert_page is an option,
unless the memory is allocated with dma_alloc_* or similar, in
which case you should probably be using remap_pfn_range.
