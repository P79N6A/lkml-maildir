Just checked. It doesn't work with the  latest (Linus) 2.6-test and
radeonfb. Do you have any special patches in your tree for radeonfb?
BTW: It took me quite a while to figure out that the only working image
with yaboot was the zImage.chrp. The normal vmlinux doesn't contain a
valid ELF signature (according to yaboot) and the seemingly obvious
vmlinux.elf-pmac goes boom while trying to decompress the kernel.
