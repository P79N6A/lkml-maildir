Paul, we are in 100% agreement here about the tasks. All I'm saying is that 
the same exact thing applies to the irqs. Again let me try your example.
Suppose we have
	/dev/cpuset/A
	/dev/cpuset/B
	/dev/cpuset/C
Now suppose that for whatever reason I must run task1 on the cpus that belong 
to sets A and B but not C. The only way to do that with cpusets is
	/dev/cpuset/X
         	  |-- A
	          `-- B
	/dev/cpuset/C
i.e. create parent cpuset X and assign task1 into cpuset X.
Of course if A and B are not cpu_exclusive then X does not have to be their 
parent.
Makes sense so far ?
Now the same exact thing can be said about the irqs. If I need to assign irq1 
to the cpus in sets A and B but not C I have to create set X that is the union 
of A and B, and assign irq1 to the set X.
This is what I meant by "deeper hierarchies" in the earlier emails.
Did I do a better job explaining this time :) ?
