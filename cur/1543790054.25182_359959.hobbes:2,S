I should probably mention that this is a 3rd party device driver for a 
PCI card, which is not part of the kernel itself.  I'm just looking to 
add 32bit compatibility options to make this device driver work with as 
many kernel versions as possible.

I'll put in a check for kernel version, and use compat_ioctl in the 
file_operations struct for 2.6.11.  And then I'll have a read about 
register_ioctl32_conversion for versions of the kernels pre-2.6.11.
I'll also have a read about why it was changed, but just out of interest :)
Thanks Arnd,
James
