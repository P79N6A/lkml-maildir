How many times does Stephan need to say it? 'Generally do'
is not enough, because it means 'sometimes they dont'.
Most filesystems *are* designed with badblock lists and such,
it is possible to teach fs drivers to tolerate write errors
by adding affected blocks to the list and continuing (as opposed
to 'remounted ro, BOOM!'). As usual, this can only happen if someone
will step forward and code it.
Do you think it would be a Wrong Thing to do?
