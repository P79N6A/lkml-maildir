Subject: PATCH 2.4.0.9.7: fix PCI class test in ide-pci.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

My laptop reports that its IDE interface is PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_IDE,
but the code which tests for this looks all screwed up.
I changed the test as shown by the below patch, which looks like an
obviously correct fix to me.
When tested on my laptop, I now get
	VP_IDE: bad irq(0): will probe later
Looking at lspci, my IDE interface doesn't report its IRQ directly via
the PCI interface, so this message looks correct (if a bit ominous).
