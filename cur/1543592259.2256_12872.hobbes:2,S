This is vanliia ext2.  The O_TRUNC problem is easy to reproduce,
and goes away when EXT*2*_PREALLOC is undefined.  Haven't looked
into it further, but I suppose one should.  It's not nice having
unexplained mysteries in ext2.

This is an excellent point - it would be unwise to go to the
effort and complexity of putting prealloc back into ext3
without first analysing how useful it actually is.  Perhaps
some tuning of the other anti-fragmentation algorithms
will suffice.
For example, when we miss the goal block we search forward
up to 63 blocks for a *single* free block, and use that.
Perhaps we shouldn't?
And perhaps the search for eight contiguous free blocks
is no longer appropriate to current disks.  32 may be better?
So I'd prefer to set up a simulator and at least validate the
current algorithms beforehand, perhaps tune them as well.
