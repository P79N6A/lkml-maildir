And it appears to be: i no longer see the message.

Neat.

The code is trying to share the IRQ for the cardbus controller with the
ATI Rage Mobility AGP chip. But that shouldn't be a problem, right?
One thing i noticed: lspci and /proc/pci will tell you the interrupts
each device has registered, so you can work out which interrupts are
shared. /proc/interrupt OTOH apparantly only shows the last device
to register it. Shouldn't it at least indicate that this is a shared
interrupt? Not that this is overly important, but older docs still tell
people that this "file" lists all the interrupts, when in fact it does
not completely do so.
Now back to the problem: the lockup is only a lockup of the PS/2 controller.
When i remove the PC-Card and reinsert it, the keyboard and touchpad work
again. Unfortunately that does not fix the ethernet problem.  What information
can i provide to nail this bug?  Since i will do frequent recompiles over the
weekend anyway, i can without problem test patches (and a 400MHz PII doesn't
do too badly in the recompile business anyway)
