It's just how the default for signal() is set up by the 'C' runtime
library. Instead of using signal, use sigaction(), set the SA_RESTART
flag and you have BSD action.
It is also possible to compile existing applications using
-D_BSD_SIGNALS  (this is from memory, it might not be exactly correct).
New applications should not use signal(), then should use sigaction()
which gives POSIX-defined fine control over the signal handler.
