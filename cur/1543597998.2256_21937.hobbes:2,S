I tried to reproduce this locally, but was never able to do so.  My
best guess is that the default rules for building lex/yacc grammers don't
include proper dependencies for the generated y.tab.h file.  Of course,
it shouldn't be necessary.  Both aicasm_gram.y and aicasm_scan.l should
have newer dates than the y.tab.h file from a previous build (both are
updated for 2.4.9) and aicasm_gram.c is listed first in the dependency
line, so yacc should have already been run prior to the compilation of
aicasm_scan.c.
Perhaps a make guru can lend some insight?
If you manually go into drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm and do a make clean, the
error should go away.
Of course, you could just disable the build of the firmware in your
kernel config...
