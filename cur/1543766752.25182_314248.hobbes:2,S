The userspace library should be able to track the tree and the overlaps,
etc.  Things might become interesting when the memory is MAP_SHARED
pagecache and multiple independent processes are involved, although I guess
that'd work OK.
But afaict the problem wherein part of a page needs VM_DONTCOPY and the
other part does not cannot be solved.
