After compiling 2.6.0-test7-mm1, I get the following error after installing the
modules:
if [ -r System.map ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map  2.6.0-test7-mm1; fi
WARNING: /lib/modules/2.6.0-test7-mm1/kernel/fs/ext2/ext2.ko needs unknown symbol
__blockdev_direct_IO
I checked the filesystem code and the function __blockdev_direct_IO is defined
at fs/direct-io.c, line 1020. However, the EXPORT_SYMBOL() definition uses
"blockdev_direct_IO", not "__blockdev_direct_IO". Grepping the include/linux
directory shows inline definitions for various wrappers for __blockdev_direct_IO,
including "blockdev_direct_IO", in include/linux/fs.h at line 1355. Yet depmod
can't seem to find it for the ext2 module.
Does this have anything to do with Jens Axboe's IDE write barrier/JBD write
barrier work?
