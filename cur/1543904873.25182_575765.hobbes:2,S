In my case, this is 'problem' occur when I do run snmpd on
the same machine, and I saw that snmpd doing something
like this:
    ...
    } else if (ioctl(fd, SIOCDEVPRIVATE, &ifr) >= 0) {
       new_ioctl_nums  = 1;
    }
    ....
That cause sundance printing a lot of debug messages (i.e netdev_ioctl()
in sundance.c) .. periodically, as long as snmpd running :-)
