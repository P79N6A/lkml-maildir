Do we _have_ to use kmap here?  It's slow and theoretically deadlocky. 
kmap_atomic() is much preferred.
Can the other kmap() calls in ecryptfs be converted?
We'd actually like to remove kmap() one day.  Not much chance of that, but
it's an objective.

Are we assured that ecryptfs_read_xattr_region() cannot overrun the page?

The kernel must always run flush_dcache_page() after modifying a pagecache
page by hand.  Please review all of ecryptfs for this.
