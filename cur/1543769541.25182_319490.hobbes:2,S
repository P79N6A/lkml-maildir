The real question is whether or not getpagesize uses this?  This should
be information that is passed to libc and not be something that the user
program uses directly.  As you noticed, this vector is also architecture
specific, and should be only used by libc.  I believe that the linker is
probably the driving factor for this information and not the kernel, so
the kernel headers should not be included.
