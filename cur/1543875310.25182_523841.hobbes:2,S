The attached patch was already reported as being responsible for a 
different regression.
Does reverting it help?
If not, and if you'll need any help with bisecting for the guilty patch, 
please send me a private email.

Subject: adjust legacy IDE resource setting (v2)
To: linux-stable <stable@kernel.org>
Message-ID: <45F6E79B.1010208@redhat.com>
From: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@novell.com>
adjust legacy IDE resource setting (v2)
The change to force legacy mode IDE channels' resources to fixed non-zero
values confuses (at least some versions of) X, because the values reported
by the kernel and those readable from PCI config space aren't consistent
anymore.  Therefore, this patch arranges for the respective BARs to also
get updated if possible.
