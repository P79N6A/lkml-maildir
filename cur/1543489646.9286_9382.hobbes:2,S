And if only we had a no-op system call, the entry.S change wouldn't be
needed either...  I suppose you could use `sync' but people might get
upset about the severe performance hit.
Yes, that looks good.  When I first wrote that post, I didn't correctly
understand the semantics of ORIG_EAX, and so I didn't even consider
using it, but I also hadn't seen the restriction on poking it.
Only disadvantage is it will have to be done separately in all the arch/
trees, and I don't know enough about any other architecture.  But I
suppose it can be left for others...
I will submit such a patch when I have the time, in the next few days.
