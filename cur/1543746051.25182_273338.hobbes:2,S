Andi Kleen reported:
  Newer gcc rewrites sprintf(buf,"%s",str) to strcpy(buf,str) transparently.
This is only true with unit-at-a-time (disabled on i386 but enabled
on x86_64). The Linux kernel doesn't offer a standard C library, and 
such transparent replacements of kernel functions with builtins are 
quite fragile.
Even with -ffreestanding, it's still possilble to explicitely use a gcc 
builtin if desired.
