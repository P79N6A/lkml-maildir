The cost of moving this piece of history from one git tree to another
git tree is that we make it harder to debug the kernel for the advanced user
that knows how to do bisect.
It is not like this history would be lost - one just had to look
somewhere else to find it.
That may be a bad pain/benefit ratio - time will tell.
There should be a way to avoid such pain when bisecting without
having to mark a semi-random (for the average person) commit as good.
As in something that is present when the average bisect user pull the tree,
and not something the user has to do afterwards.
