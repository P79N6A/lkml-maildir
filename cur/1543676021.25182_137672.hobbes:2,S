I know jumping in the middle of a conversation is bad, but....
In conversations with the SBP2 folks, they indicated to me that the way
they do hotplugging is very different from the way usb-storage does it.
The end result (I'm told) is that invoking a scan from userspace is often
needed for SBP2 but never for usb-storage.
So, comparing the two is really pointless.
