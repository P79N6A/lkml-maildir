But "menuconfig" _is_ special ...

Well, I'd have to disagree here. A config symbol has code associated
with it (at least _all_ config symbols in the kernel originally did, till
when these "menuconfig" things got introduced, which is precisely
what made them "special").
These "menuconfig" things are (or were supposed to be, at least :-)
just a _presentation_ thing.

I'm not sure why anybody would prefer such a syntax / idiom.
I know that "de gustibus non est disputandum", but personally
I find such usage *horribly* unclear.
