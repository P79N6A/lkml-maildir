When I rebuilt the kernel I turned off APM as well as multicast (and
IPX, as some others have pointed fingers at) and still saw these 8808
packets going out.  But that was on a test net consisting only of my
box, the server & the sniffer (on a hub).  In particular, I didn't
verify that the packet was identical to the one which drove the cisco
insane.
