If it's not a driver issue I don't have other ideas right now. Nothing
relevant to VM performances is changed in recent 2.2.x kernels as far I
can tell.

Ok, for 2.2.15pre I suggest these two patches:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.14aa1/no-swapout-2.2.10-B.gz
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.14aa1/trashing-mem-2.2.10-A.gz
The first one will make sure to not swapout/swapin at infinity during
heavy I/O on disk. The second one will avoid an hog to stall the machine.
And I would suggest also this below patch even if way less important and
it may hurt a bit on 3/4mbyte machines (the few 3/4mbyte machines can
fixup the change via sysctl at boot):
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.14aa1/shrink_all_cache-2.2.10-A.gz
BTW, Alan could you tell me about your problems with atomic allocation? I
think I missed your post (I did a fast search but I didn't succeed to find
it yet, you write lots of emails :-).
