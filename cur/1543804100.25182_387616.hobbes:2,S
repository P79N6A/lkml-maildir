	Better is to be at the same dir as other bttv modules. Currently, it
wil be under drivers/media/video. It seems to me that drivers/media
should be better organized, since lots of shared code between dvb and
v4l are emerging. IMHO, it seems to be a good idea to create a newer dir
to handle chipsets like:
 /drivers/media/chips/
	and include bttv, cx88, em28xx, saa7134 and others as separate dirs
under /chips. This way, it would be easier to detect code duplications
and similarities.

	I've waited to the end of 2.6.16 window to start these discussions to
give us some time to fix compilation order and to realign all necessary
stuff. I think we will have some time until 2.6.17 to prioritize sound
core loading as Linus suggested. There's no rush for such changes.

	Agreed. I have already a patch for it to use choice type. I'll work on
it to select CONFIG_SND and CONFIG_SND_PCM.
