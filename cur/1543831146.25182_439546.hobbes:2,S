for_each_zone() and for_each_online_pgdat() need this.  So the export is an
internal implementation detail to support those macros.  Those macros are
reasonable(ish) things to be doing from modules - could be that people
are using for_each_zone() already.

We could give it a whizz, but I'd expect that we'll end up dropping it. 
But then again, zones are fairly low-level things.  Let's give it a try.
