By putting a series of 'crashme/reboot' calls into the kernel, I 
narrowed a possibl cause of it down to this bit of code in 
drivers/input/serio.c:753
/*
  * Write CTR back.
  */
	if (i8042_command(&i8042_ctr, I8042_CMD_CTL_WCTR)) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "i8042.c: Can't write CTR while initializing i8042.\n");
		return -1;
	}
If I do the reboot instructions before this, it reboots fine. 
Afterwards, and it just sits there, no reboot.
Any ideas what to think/look for/do?
Sascha, to see if your problem is the same as mine, you might try 
putting this bit of code before the above call:
	{
	    static struct
	    {
		unsigned short       size __attribute__ ((packed));
		unsigned long long * base __attribute__ ((packed));
	    } no_idt = { 0, 0 };
	    /* That didn't work - force a triple fault.. */
	    __asm__ __volatile__("lidt %0": :"m" (no_idt));
	    __asm__ __volatile__("int3");
	}
It will cause your machine to reboot before it's even finished booting, 
so don't do it with your only available kernel!
Thanks,
