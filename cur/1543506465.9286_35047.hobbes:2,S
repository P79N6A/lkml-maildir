Dear sir,
i am new to linux so my problem is extremely trivial
1)i run ./configure to configure a new software
i get this error gcc not running, it cannot make executable files
i checked i did not install gcc properly
the header files are not availa ble
so please recomend a ftp site for gcc
or how to do this thing
remember i dont have a c compiler
thank u sir
sos
