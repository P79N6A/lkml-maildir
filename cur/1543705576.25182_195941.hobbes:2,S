Thanks for your patience. What are you building, by the way? It
slipped my mind.
You could try an experimental VM patch out if you're feeling brave.
Don't know if it will do you any good or not. You'll have to use
this patch against the 2.6.2-rc3-mm1 kernel.
What I really want to know though, is why it appears like 2.6 is
doing twice as much writeout even at the same vm thresholds as 2.4.
