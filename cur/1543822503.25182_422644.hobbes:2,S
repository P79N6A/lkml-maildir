They already have a vTPM - iirc TPMs support random numbers so
that could be used. But it's probably complicated to use.
But if sampling virtual events for randomness is really unsafe (is it 
really?) then native guests in Xen would also get bad random numbers
and this would need to be somehow addressed.
I haven't seen real evidence yet why the virtual events should 
provide less randomness than the hardware.
