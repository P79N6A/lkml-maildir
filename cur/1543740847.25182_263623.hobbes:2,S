Ok. But I need you to sign this using some recognised signature -
other folks can suggest mechanisms we can use that are legally valid.
I'm happy to act as a gobetween if we could get you to undertake to
accept liability for any infringing code left in the kernel after any
proven SCO demands were to be met (I'm sure other folks can see where
I'm going with this discussion - let's see what the response is).

Like I said, if you could provide this to me with legally valid,
documented proof that you'll accept liability for further infringement
then that would help greatly with this thread.

That surprises me. I thought Darl loved Linux more than life itself -
thanks for the correction.

If you mail it to me at: jcm@jonmasters.org along with some contact
details then I can arrange to have you mail me a signed declaration
accepting liability.

I'd love to interview the guy, if he were interested.

IBM must be devastated. Seriously. I mean, they're what, the world's
fourth largest bank or something along those lines? Isn't that enough
money to buyout SCO a bazillion times over and still have some pocket
change left over?

That's interesting. Can you commit to that too in your declaration please?

Did he check the dodo_lock_t stuff too?

Were there any restrictions upon when that person was an employee?

Thanks. I look forward to reading that.
