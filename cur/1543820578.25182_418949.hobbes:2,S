OK. I am not conflating the policy issues and the
mechanism issue of SELinux. The mechanisms of SELinux
lead to the policy issues. A complete set of policies
for an SELinux system require an unreasonable number
of rules. This violates the Third item of the TCB
principle, which is the the TCB must be small enough
to analyse. The mechanisms are pointless without the
rules.
Conflating my forehead!
