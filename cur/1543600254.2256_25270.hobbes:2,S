Routers aren't real time for example
The specific issues you have to watch are mostly from user space. Kernel irq
handlers will run very rapidly providing another driver is not holding the
interrupts off for a long time. Certain types of PC device require this 
(some IDE controllers for example). You also have to watch PCI graphics
cards some of which will stall the PCI bus locking the CPU off it for 
milliseconds at a time [its a hack to get better benchmark numbers - sick
isnt it]
So with the kernel you should be able to respond to irqs at 8Khz, with
RtLinux you can make that a definitive mathematically hard guarantee
Depends which you need
