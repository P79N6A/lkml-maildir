I brought up the same thing in the netfilter and netfilter-dev lists
last month.  
http://www.spinics.net/lists/netfilter/msg18030.html
I think there's no need for a special netfilter rule if the assumption
is made that an ESP packet reaching the "mangle" chain of the "INPUT"
table is definitely destined for a local process.  At that point, it
should be automatically unencapsulated so that its true protocol and
port numbers can be interrogated.  e.g. if we know an ESP packet is for
this machine, do the unencapsulation as early as possible.  Since
there's not yet a consensus on the behavior of things like NAT-based
forwarding of IPsec packets I think this is a safe assumption.  (But my
opinion generally doesn't count for much.)
If it's important to remember that the packet had been an ESP packet,
netfilter can be set up to mark it as such in the PREROUTING mangle
chain so that it can later be filtered appropriately.  This seems
similar to what I've read is done in FreeBSD:

That's sort of what I thought too.  And, yeah, I'd be real happy if
someone else did it before I tried to.  8^)
