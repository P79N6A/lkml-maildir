Something that occurs to me, which is somewhat related to this:
My understanding, (which might be wrong) is that termination of the
IDE bus is partly handled by each connected devicem rather like modern
floppy drives, (in contrast to SCSI, 10-base-2, old floppy drives etc,
where the termination is handled by devices at the physical ends of
the cable).
So if you connnect a really old IDE disk, say a 20 Mb one, and an
ATA-100 one to the same bus, is the termination then out of spec,
(analogous to using passive terminators on anything other than a SCSI-1
bus), because presumably the termination requirements are stricter for
the higher bus speed and signaling on both edges?
Just wondered.
John.
