just to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to optimize it _everywhere_,
I mean that optimizing it in only 100 machines and an embedded niche is
worthless.  I'm not saying it's worthless to optimize it everywhere
(though I doubt it's a measurable slowdown given the order > 0 is
unlikely in the first place). if you check my first emails about the
compound thing I wasn't very happy about it. The only single reason I
had to keep it on by default is that currently I feel unsafe about
optimizing it away turning it off by default, since the big testing (on
weird drivers too) has happened so far with compound on by default, and
disabling it everywhere would risk to trigger bugs, and this clearly
shows you how unreliable it is to return different things from
alloc_pages in function of an unrelated hugetlbfs option, and this is a
basic problem I'm fixing.
