The problem is that the "target inode" may not be the one obviously causing the
loop - you may be trying to link a directory into a/b/c, while the loop
is caused by a link from a/b/c/d/e/f/g back up to someplace.
Consider:
function mkdir_tree(foo) {
for i=1,3 do
  for j=1,3 do
   for k=1,3 do
	mkdir ${foo}/a${i}/b${j}/c${k}
}
mkdir_tree(x)
mkdir_tree(y)
mkdir_tree(z)
ln x/a2/b3/c3/d1 y
ln x/a1/b3/c3/d2 y
ln y/a1/b1/c3/d1 z
ln y/a1/b1/c2/d2 z
ln y/a1/b2/c1/d3 z
Now - ln z/a3/b1/c3/d1 x - how many directories do you need to
examine to tell if this is a loop?  Is it still a loop if I rm z/d1 first?
or z/d2? or do I need to remove z/d1 through z/d3 to prevent a loop?
Can I leave z/d1 there but remove y/a1/b2/c3/d1 instead?
Does your answer change if somebody did 'ln y/a1/b2/c4 z/a1/b3/d7'?
How many places would you have to look if I didn't give you a cheat sheet
of the ln commands I had done?  Yes, you have to search *every* directory
under x, y, and z.  All 120 of them.  And this is an artificially small
directory tree.  Think about a /usr/src/ that has 4 or 5 linux-kernel
trees in it, with some 1,650 directories per tree...

"The average case" is the one where the feature isn't used.  When you
actually *use* it, you get "not average case" behavior - not a good sign.

Even if that's sufficient (which it isn't), it's going to be painful to lock
the filesystem for 20 or 30 seconds while you walk everything to make sure
there's no problem.
