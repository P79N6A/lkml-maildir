that's not the point.  the point is that this has every sign of 
being premature optimization.  the "chat" benchmark does no work,
it only generates load.  and yes, indeed, you can cause contention
if you apply enough load in the right places.  this does NOT indicate
that any real apps apply the same load in the same places.
