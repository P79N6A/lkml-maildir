Hi Ted. I would have loved to have fixed it myself, or had one of the
other oprofile contributors do so. Unfortunately I have no control over
what the distributions do. For example:

At the time when I was trying to fix this, I wasn't aware of any way to
propose a new standard and get distributions to follow it - is there
some way now? Informally I discussed this problem several times with
many people without any resolution. As regards searching informal paths,
this is extremely risky - get the wrong vmlinux and we end up with
inaccurate results, which is worse than no results.

I'm not abdicating responsibility: I no longer maintain oprofile,
haven't for a long time, and the other contributors don't have any real
time to spend on it either.  I'm well aware there are improvements to be
made: when I (and others) had time, this stuff was improving massively
with each release. When Soren et al had a need for a simple tool + GUI,
they should have helped out with this: it's simply good engineering to
not duplicate efforts. I didn't even get a /single/ email.
