if you bring the argument to its logical extreme then yes. (And human 
history is rich with pointless wars fought over various arguments brought 
to their logical extreme.)
a more pragmatic approach is that EMBEDDED is the specialization stuff 
that can break a box easily without the average kernel tester noticing 
why. Average kernel testers know about drivers and know about the 
architecture they run on. They might not know what apps rely on 
CONFIG_FUTEX for example.
They will probably be aware of the basic CPU type they are using - but the 
whole option brings only marginal benefits (on the order of 10 kilobytes 
of RAM) and the failure scenario is ugly. I have run into it myself: i 
booted a bzImage i assumed would work on a box but it wouldnt due to this. 
It's a subjective category and no amount of talking will bring any 
solution here.
