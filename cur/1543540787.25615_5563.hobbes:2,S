I have tried two other mailing(like linux-net, etc) lists with this
question and no luck, so I thought I will try it here.
One of our systems was compromised with t666.c I believe, there was a
directory called AMDROCKS in /var/named
(RH6.2 2.2.14)So I upgraded to named, and few other things. Named was
and is running under its own username, etc.
This is what I have gathered from the named debug file. The domain name
here in question is not ours, nor we have anything to do with it. Can
someone please translate into english the following lines. ????

update type 30: 6507 bytes is too much data
And this is when the DNS server went down. Any idea on what was the
purpose of this ?
BTW: Can anyone explain why does bind 2.5pre9 listen on a high udp port
?
Thank you
