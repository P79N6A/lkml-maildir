I had no problems listening to the stream, except a gap after about 3mins.
tcpdump showed the client closed the connection, and quickly initiated a
new one. Since then i had 15mins of nonstop playback and it stopped,
similarily to your dump.
The tcpdump is similar to yours, except i do not have traffic class info.
And rarely sack was used.
Is there a ip6 mangling router in your route to the icecast server?
I have been listening on an ip6 enabled host behind my ip6 tunnelling
router to my MAN.
Client: linux-2.4.21-pre1
Router: linux-2.4.20-grsec
I have to go now, i will look into that later.
Regards,
Maciej
