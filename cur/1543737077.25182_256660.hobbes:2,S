Well, readahead is still done internally by filemap.c without consulting
the individual fs.

Do you really want that, though?  I'd have thought that grabbing a DLM
lock was potentially a high-latency operation, so you might actually
_benefit_ from notification that you want to start acquiring it early. 
If it's going to be prohibitively expensive to acquire, though, you'd
still want the option of not doing so.
But there's not really any way for the fs to tell right now whether a
read is for readahead or not.  It can _nearly_ do so: if you implement
a_ops->readpages(), then that only gets called for readahead.  
Trouble is, that same readahead code is also used to kick off early
reads when the user actually requested a single large read.  If the app
reads 100k at once, then do_generic_mapping_read() first kicks off
readahead, then does individual page-sized read_page()s to get the
data.  And the readahead code doesn't really know about this at all; it
can't tell what amount of sequential data the user is guaranteed to
want.
ext3 could make use of this sort of information too, btw.  Currently,
mpage_readpages() ends up calling the fs get_block() to map all the
pages for reading, before submitting the IO request; and even though
the final IO is async, the get_block() is still fully synchronous.  If
ext3 knew it was a readahead, it could potentially queue the read for
the indirect block and return EAGAIN, stopping the readahead at the
point where we don't yet have mapping information in cache.
But you don't want ext3_get_block() returning EAGAIN for synchronous
reads. :-)

Does the current 2.6 ahead-window readahead still show that problem?
