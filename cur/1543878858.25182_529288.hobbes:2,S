Unioning is quite odd. It uses concepts, some of which do indeed belong in
the VFS (like actual merging of the lower directories), but others that most
definitely do not (like whiteouts).

I don't think that copyup is the problem, but whiteouts...oh boy.
Whiteouts/some kind of persistent storage is most definitely a filesystem
construct, and it does not belong in the VFS.
