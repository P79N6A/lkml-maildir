Hi all,
I'm a rookie in Linux development, and I have to develop a small driver 
for a data-acquisition card on PCI port.
My problem is that my compiler does not recognize some functions such as 
'pci_resource_start()', or 'pci_find_device()' ...
I used option  'gcc [...] -lpci' in order to link with pci lib, but 
that's not better. It seems that I have many different versions of the  
pci.h file : /usr/src/linux2.4.18-14/include/linux/pci/h is much bigger 
and much more complete, and more interesting (or it seems to be) than my 
/usr/include/linux/pci.h one, or even /usr/include/driver/pci/pci.h one.
If I do a 'locate pci.a', and then a 'grep pci_resource 
filed-returned-by-locate', I do not have anything. That could mean the 
functions I look for do not exist in my lib.
What do I have to do if I wan't to use the .../src/linux2.4.18... one?
Thanks for any help.
Please tell me if linux-kernel list does not directly concern my problem 
or if there others that fit better.
Damien
