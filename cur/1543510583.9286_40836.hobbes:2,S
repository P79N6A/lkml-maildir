There are several attack directions:
 - force system into out-of-memory condition and kill the system completely;
   the protection - upper limit for the number of entries;
 - force lookups to take too much time; plain hash table allows attacker to
   place all nodes in a single list; walking through the list of about 65000
   elements from BH kills the whole system;
 - use upper limit for number of entries (implemented to solve #1) to block
   creation of new nodes; it doesn't kill the system, it doesn't kill IP -
   only new peers will be denied to communicate.
AVL tree helps attackers to implement #3 a bit faster.  But it saves the
whole system.  I definitely don't want anyone to crash my system.
And your word "twice" is a overestimation :-)
For AVL needs I keep 2 pointers instead of 1 - it increases the structure
size by 14 percents.

The thing which may be removed without big troubles is a list of unused
entries introduced to make entry expiration more cheap.
But it requires some new ideas how to do cleanup() efficiently.
May be random walk over the tree and removing the too old nodes?
Best wishes
