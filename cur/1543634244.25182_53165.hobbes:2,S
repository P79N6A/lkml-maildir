	Before anyone notices, I want to clarify something I wrote:
| Russell King, for example, has complained on linux-kernel
| that the pressure to "make it compile" lead to bad fixes which are now
| more hidden because just the compiler symptoms have been fixed.
	I only meant to attribute the opinion before the word "which"
to Russell.
