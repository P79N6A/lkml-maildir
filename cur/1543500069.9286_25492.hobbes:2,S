I'm with Ted on this one, not that it matters.
One of the stated objectives of reiserfs is to allow applications
programmers efficiently to use the filesystem as their primary
storage interface, rather than having to amalgamate small objects
into opaque things like DBM files.
File streams may help this, but they require the user (and thus his
toolset) to work at a higher abstraction level and forget the usual
assumption that a document is a file is a document.
In that case, my preference would be just to work with directories
and be done with it.
Matthew.
