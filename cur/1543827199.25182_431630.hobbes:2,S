That's a great argument.
You're arguing that your thing is good by pointing to a known disaster 
area and saying "but that other thing does it too, so it must be good".
O_DIRECT is a piece of crap, and I'm still sorry that I didn't push back 
enough on it. And I _did_ push back on it. But I finally was worn down.
And yes, part of the problem is exactly that it uses _almost_ the same 
paths, but not quite. 
Oh, well.
