I concur that #1 is closest.  I'd prefer it to happen on a
write fault rather read but the frequency with which
this should occur is low enough i wouldn't sweat it.
It is a non-standard overload of SIGBUS.  SIGBUS is to
indicate an unaligned memory access or otherwise malformed
address. Many confuse SIGBUS with SIGSEGV because they are
usually symptoms of the same problems but a SIGSEGV is to
indicate memory protection violation (unresolvable page
fault) which is not the same as a malformed address.  I
believe Linux, at least on x86 maps both errors to SIGSEGV.
I would think SIGXFSZ might be a better fit.
