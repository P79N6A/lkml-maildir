My priority as far as serial stuff goes is to keep what we now have
stable so that the people who _need_ to use it (those in the ARM world)
have a chance of stability.
This doesn mean that the input stuff as far as the serial side is
concerned, and the other changes to integrate some parts of the
serial layer into the tty layer as suggested by Ted will have to
hold off for a while as the current implementation matures and
stabilises.
