	This will only equalize flows (each new remote ip will be
randomly assigned to one of the interfaces, after that all transit to
that ip happens via that interface).  To equlize packets you need to
use the equalize keyword.  NOTE, this requires a patched kernel.  IIRC
the patch is part of the diff-serv patch.  iproute must be recompiled
will the diffserv option set as well.
	Then all outgoing packets will be randomized as to transmit
interface within the group.
	And of course the inbound depends on what the far end is
doing.
