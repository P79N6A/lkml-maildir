I think at the first mount time there was a read error for an unknown 
reason, and this turned the partition (not the filesystem) into read-only 
mode. All further mount attempts only found a read-only medium, and thus 
where only able to mount read-only. I've been bitten by this more than 
once, too - there seems to be no way to avoid a reboot/replug when one of 
your data disks has thrown a read error, taking (for me) the whole server 
down, when just one unimportant data-disk thinks it has problems again (as 
happens with my home-server about once every one or two weeks).
