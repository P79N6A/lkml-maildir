Personally I don't like the current approach. However, I believe the
philosophy behind it is that users rarely look in dmesg and they
should be notified (and beaten with a stick) when their badly written
app spawns unaligned accesses which end up being emulated by the
kernel.
These messages are normally caused by userland code, so kprobes
probably wont do much good :)
Cheers,
Jes
