You'd usurally just create+open a file and erase it without closing it.
The only access to this file is by using the file descriptor (or, off 
cause, /proc/pid/fd/num). If the last reference to this file, the running 
process, is gone, so is the file.

There was some proc privacy patch some time ago. It was argued about 
because some sites want peer review on system usage. I lost track 
if it was included.

The plan is:
1) make namespaces joinable
2) ???
3) profit
No, that's wrong. The plan is (should be?):
1) make namespaces joinable in a sane way
2) wait for the shared subtree patch
3) make pam join the per-user-namespace
4) make pam automount tmpfs on the private /tmp
