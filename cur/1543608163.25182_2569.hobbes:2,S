Yeah, right. Why don't you download that tar ball, unpack it, and have a 
look what it contains before disseminating uninformed, and incorrect 
information?!?
To quote from the main readme of above tar ball:
"shared object libraries (libEM8400.so, libosd.so) in lib/
   are only available in binary form.
   Copyrighted (C) 1999-2000 Sigma Designs"
Those libraries are EVERYTHING that matters. And they are _binary_ only. 
The stuff that is actually given as source and even as GPL is just glue 
code which defines an API to access the binary only library and kernel 
modules which cause the library to be hooked into the kernel. This is just 
about as far as you can get from open source drivers!

Ok, so I am stupid and am unable to find this document. Why don't you email 
me the URL so I can download it and see for myself? I would really very 
much appreciate it!!!
Best regards,
Anton
