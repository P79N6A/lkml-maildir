This one works fine: no more non-merged requests :)
I also notice a performance boost with bonnie, mainly with char i/o,
obviously.
2.4.0-test6 (I do't remember what differs between the first and the
             2nd one.... probably MAX_SECTORS is doubled in the 2nd test)

2.2 is still faster...
My config: PowerMac G3 350MHz, Adaptec 2930U, HD IBM 9GB (raw speed is ~14MB/s
with
2.2 and 13-16MB/s with 2.4), 192 MB ram.
Bye.
