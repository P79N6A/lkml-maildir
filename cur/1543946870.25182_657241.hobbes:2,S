It's an enabler for getting a move forward towards replacing the old
isdn4linux subsystem, which has really outlived its time by now.

Great. I'm looking forward to that.

But it's the kernel bits which are essential for porting existing
isdn4linux hardware drivers to CAPI/mISDN!
Btw, could you perhaps clear up the terminology while you're at it?
Last time I looked, mISDN was advertised as a framework for writing
CAPI drivers for passive ISDN adapters, in turn using CAPI4Linux,
the Linux CAPI subsystem. Nowadays the picture is rather less
clearcut.

I'm all for following that precedent: support both frameworks in
parallel, mark the old one as deprecated, give help in porting
hardware support to the new one, and when all the hardware that's
actually still in use in the field is supported by the new one,
remove the old one.

Absolutely. It's high time mISDN found it's way into the main tree,
otherwise it's in danger of degenerating into a niche solution.

Reality check, please. Have a look in the field how many systems
still use isdn4linux. Or do a simple experiment: Take a distribution
which has been known for good ISDN support in the past (I think you
know the one) and set it up for Internet access via a typical cheap
ISDN card. Then look which ISDN subsystem you end up with. You may
be surprised.

Exactly. But there are two preconditions for porting an in-tree
isdn4linux driver to mISDN: First, mISDN must also be in-tree,
otherwise an in-tree driver cannot rely on it. And second, someone
must understand both the old driver and the mISDN framework in
order to be able to actually do the porting. The maintainer of the
old driver can provide the first part, but knowledge about mISDN
will need to come from the mISDN collective.
