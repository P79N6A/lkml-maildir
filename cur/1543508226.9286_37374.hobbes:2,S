I'm not 100% certain, but my understanding is that "lock the kernel"
means "prevent anybody else ON THIS PROCESSOR from executing any
kernel code", which is slightly different from your definition.

Presumably not applicable - I believe that's what spinlocks are for,
and is also why both are needed in certain parts of the kernel.
Best wishes from Riley.
