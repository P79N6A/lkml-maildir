Use pci_alloc_consistent() to allocate the buffer.  This function
returns the right thing so that virt_to_bus() is no longer needed.
 From what I read, it looks like pci_alloc_consistent returns a pci 
address and a physical address (via dma_addr_t), so it should be simple 
to change the code to use this function.  However, I don't know where 
the hell I'm supposed to find pci_dev -- I'll try rereading the 
driver-model.txt code again :).
