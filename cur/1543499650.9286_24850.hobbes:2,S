The current major/minor allocations are becoming a mess. There are holes,
and some legacy overlaps in allocations. There are also some arbitrary
limits on number of devices eg serial that are caused by maj/min
allocation. There might be plans to move to 8:24 or 16:16 but still doesnt
solve the problem of central registry and general messiness. In fact it
may make it worse 8)
And it looks like /dev/ptyp0 moved from 4:128 to 2:0 - what happens if you
boot a new kernel on an old fs with ancient maj/min allocations? Does the
kernel bitch or does it blow up 8)
