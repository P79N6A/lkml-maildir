	The kernel is trying to give you what it thinks you want. The general idea
behind setting these buffers is that you want about that many actual bytes
of data from the stream to be buffered. But the memory is used for things
other than stream data. So to try to give it room for, say 10Kb of stream
data, it allocates 20Kb of memory.
