I would just like to follow up:
Burning problem turned out to by my error:
brw-rw----  1 root disk  3, 0 2002-06-09 15:27 hda
brw-rw-rw-  1 root disk 22, 0 2002-06-09 15:27 hdc
I normally burn as a regular user, not root.
Kernel 2.6.3 is working good with emu10k1, lm_sensors, nvidia 5536.
Using an ABIT IC7-G motherboard.
