Looks like running x86 with more than 16GB RAM is not a good idea.
If you need it, you need 64bit arch.
This limit can be raised substantially by reducing low 4GB memory 
requirements, but don't you feel it's like running 16-bit DOS
on 686 class CPU? HIMEM.SYS, EMM, horde of DOS extenders - sounds familiar?
However, CPU vendors war over common 64-bit arch is still ahead...
