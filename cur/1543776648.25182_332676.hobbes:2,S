Hmm. So we disagree on that issue as well. I think the point of review
is to improve code and help others conform with the existing coding
style which is why I find it strange that you're suggesting me to limit
my comments to a subset you agree with.
Would you please be so kind to define your criteria for things that
"need fixing" so we could see if can reach some sort of an agreement on
this. My list is roughly as follows:
  - Erroneous use of kernel API
  - Bad coding style
  - Layering violations
  - Duplicate code
  - Hard to read code
