Since I'm sure you're wondering why I have a file that large, I'm using it via loopback as my MP3 partition, so I can remove it fairly quick if the need should ever arise.
As was explained to me (just today ;) ) this is an issue of 32bit versus
64bit file sizes (and not filesystem returning junk values as I thought),
so to get this working you need a version of fileutils and C library that
supports this.
I still don't know how to upgrade by compiling the source code, but
installation of latest (8.0) Slackware packages for C library and
fileutils fixed things for me. Be careful while upgrading your C library -
things might break.
