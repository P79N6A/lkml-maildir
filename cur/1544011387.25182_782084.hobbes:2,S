Mike, although we're doing writes of the checkpoint file here, the *mm*
access is read-only.  We only need really mmap_sem for write if we're
creating new VMAs, which we only do on restore.  Was there an action
taken on the mm that would require a write that we missed?
Oren, I never considered the locking overhead, either.  The fact that
the processes are frozen is very, very important here.  The code is fine
as it stands because this *is* a very simple way to do it.  But, this
probably deserves a comment.
