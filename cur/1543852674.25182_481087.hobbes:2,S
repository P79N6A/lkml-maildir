I found the cause before your mail.
the /proc/iomem doesn't show RAM above 1M.
I have increased linuxbios table at high 0xf0000-0xf0400 to
0xf0000-0x100000. the RAM above 1M show up.
I think root cause in the latest kernel 2.6.19, e820 align increase to 0xffff.
and when it check 0xf0000-0xf0400, will make 0xf0000-0x100000
reserved, and then when it  check 0xf0400-4G, it will fail to reserved
System RAM above 1M.
I will check arch/x86_64/kernel/e820.c about
void __init e820_reserve_resources(void)
tommorrow.
