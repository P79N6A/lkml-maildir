I'd say, don't try to run it, just see if it applies cleanly.
Speaking of security, we can't expect Matti to take care of blocking spam
on the patch lists the way he does on lkml, so that is going to have to
be handled, or the system will fall apart.  Well, spammers are not going
to be bright enough to send correctly formed patches that apply without
rejects I hope, so maybe that is a non-problem.
The patchbot will have to understand the concept of a patch set, a
series of patches that apply in a particular order.  If it can handle
that it probably doesn't need a general way of handling inter-patch
relationships, at least to start.
