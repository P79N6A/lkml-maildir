I wasn't talking about in-flight IO.  Take a moment to think about it.
- You have a floppy inserted and mounted.
- You write a file to it, and then suspend the machine.
  *** No IO was in progress when the suspend occurred.
- You remove the floppy disk and insert a different disk
- You resume
- The kernel submits the dirty buffers for writing out to the disk.
That would lead to a corrupted floppy disk.

You need to step the head off track 0 and back again.  That clears the
disk changed status on the floppy drive hardware.
Now, if you'd actually taken the time to read my messages you'd have
realised that the floppy drive hardware defaults to reporting a
"disk changed" status after power on.  Ergo, after resume, it says
"disk changed" as well.
