Hi Andrew,
I ran in a race regarding seq_file listing of modules. Here is a fix proposed to
get a coherent output even if modules are being unloaded at the same time.
It is needed by the linux kernel markers.
It applies on top of 2.6.23-rc2-mm2 in this order:
seq_file_sorted.patch
module.c-sort-module-list.patch
