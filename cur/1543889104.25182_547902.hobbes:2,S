Interesting. I wonder if that would have been a better choice for
the Gigaset M101 driver. It seems even to have a probe mechanism
so one could try to determine if the expected device is really
connected to the port.
Is there any documentation on this interface? I find the source a
bit hard to understand, sparsely commented as it is.
Thanks
