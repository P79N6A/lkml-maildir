I can't reproduce the problem, it reliably works for me using pump,
dhclient or udhcpc. One thing I've noticed is that udhcpc 0.98
doesn't set the interface up itself and fails if it is down. Please
make sure that it is up in your tests.

Thanks. You mentioned you're setting up your ruleset after DHCP, which
means the patch can't be responsible because the codepath is never
taken for DHCP queries, so you probably need to do a binary search
over the remaining 180 changesets.
