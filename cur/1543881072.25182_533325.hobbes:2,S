I think I made this comment the last time we discussed this topic, but don't
remember the exact outcome.
I would prefer to not have 'depends on !S390' but rather 'depends on MMIO',
because that is what really drives stuff like IPMI: they expect the device
to be reachable through the use of ioremap or inX/outX instructions, which
don't exist on s390.
While it's unlikely that another architecture has the same restriction,
it expresses much clearer what you mean.
In drivers/Kconfig, you can then simply add a
config MMIO
	def_bool !S390
There are a few exceptions though, that I think should not depend on MMIO:

I'd leave the menu enabled. If the DMA engine infrastructure becomes more widely
used, you may want to add an implementation for s390 using milicoded instructions
like xor-string or copy-page.

Probably leave this as !S390. One could imagine channel-attached input devices
or the idea of intepreting a terminal as an input device, but no driver currently
does and probably never will.

Same here, actually there was an IBM 2216 ISDN adapter with channel attachment,
but I don't think anybody wants to add a driver for that one.

Maybe just leave the menu open, all drivers in it are already depending on PCI
or similar and someone might add a driver that does work on s390 here.

Also depends on !S390, not MMIO. A future network adapter might give you access
to the phy device through other means than MMIO.

Applications might actually want to use the RTC interface to access the system time
or get accurate timers, but the rtc drivers are all very dependant on either MMIO
or I2C. Not sure what would be best here.
