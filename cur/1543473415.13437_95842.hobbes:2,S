There are dirty tricks in asm parts of i[3456]86 linux kernel. Since gcc 2.8.x
(and egcs) are more agressive with optimization this could lead to VERY
strange behaviour sometimes. There are NO plans to make kernel 2.0.x
gcc 2.8.x/egcs-safe. For 2.2 this goal is declared but even there some
problems still not solved. In short: if you really want to sleep well at
night use gcc 2.7.2.3, not 2.8.x or egcs even if for A LOT OF peoples patch
works Ok.
P.S. Usually problems are with X and thus will not affect your proxy server but
who knows ?
