See the above stuff you quote, it's answered there. It's not a change,
this is how the Linux barrier write has always worked since I first
implemented it. What David and I are talking about is adding a more
relaxed version as well, that just implies ordering.

I see several uses for that, so I'd hope so.

We can't get more heavy weight than the current barrier, it's about as
conservative as you can get.
