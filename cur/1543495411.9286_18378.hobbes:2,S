Wait.......Andries busted his nuts to get this to work and it took a 2x4
framing board over my head to believe him.  The fact is that he has a 
viable option and should be considered.
Since there is no options to pass into the kernel like ::
	bootme=scsi or bootme=ide

Yeah, I can buy that line you are selling, but there are still some cases
that we screw up the geometry on drives that do not comply.

You should note that it is not impliment for full use yet.
It is present for a test-touch-feel.  Only a fool would try to make this
standard in its infant form.  If is a direction that needs to be
considered.

In principle, that is what I do because I have ZERO BIOS data to extract.

Prove your case and bring a 2x4.........I recall weeks of discussion near
battle for me to see Andries point.  Ask him about it and prepare for the
long haul.

Well share the crashing with all of us.......it is always fun to wipe a
drive and always start fron scratch.

Well case (b) is getting everyone a crack at active chipset code tuning
for those "buggy IDE controllers and BIOSes".  Where case (a) is modified
to "second generation" starting cutting teeth on 1.2.8.
