I dont know is soft mixing is biggest issue but ..
Few minutes ago I'm upgrade to skype 1.4.x.
Lets try again above experiment:
$ strace -f -e trace=file galeon 2>&1 | grep dev/snd
[pid 28593] open("/dev/snd/controlC0", O_RDWR) = 46
[pid 28593] open("/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK) = 47
OK .. now I'm enter on www.youtube.com and start playing random video.
Look on above: soud device was oppened in non bloking mode.
After few seconds I'm close tab with video in galeon.
Just after this I'm start skype and try call to test123 and calling isn't 
possible:
$ strace -f -e trace=file skype 2>&1 | grep dev/snd

[..]
/dev/snd/pcmC0D0p is busy ? YES because it was oppened by another 
application in non blocking mode which makes device .. unavalable to other :)
Welcome in wonderful ALSA word ..
And interesting .. why skype tries to open so meny devices (?)
