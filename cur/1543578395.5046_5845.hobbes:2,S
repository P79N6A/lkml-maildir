That's a funny statement.  Which processors do you include in "most"?
That has not been my experience.

gcc should consider the statements equivalent, and generate whichever
pattern is preferred.  On an i386 that may mean take a pattern such as
	foo = (bar << 2) + quux;
... and generate ...
	lea ecx,[esi*4+ebx]
	-hpa
