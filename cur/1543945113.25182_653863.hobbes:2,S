Subject: [PATCH] ubi: fix sparse errors in ubi.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In C, signed 1-bit bitfields can only take the values 0 and -1, only
0 and 1 are ever assigned in current code.  Make them unsigned
bitfields.
Fixes the (repeated) sparse errors:
drivers/mtd/ubi/ubi.h:220:15: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
drivers/mtd/ubi/ubi.h:221:17: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
drivers/mtd/ubi/ubi.h:222:18: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
drivers/mtd/ubi/ubi.h:223:16: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
drivers/mtd/ubi/ubi.h:224:20: error: dubious one-bit signed bitfield
