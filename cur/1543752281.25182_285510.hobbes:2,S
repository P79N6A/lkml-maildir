And that is a failure of imagination on the part of the JACK
developers. Simply add a library function to libjack or whatever:
 jack_make_me_important(...); /* pretty please */
A client starts at normal priority, asks jack nicely to promote it to
RT, then jackd, if so configured/enabled, calls the wrapper with a PID
and a priority level. The wrapper checks the UID/priority/executable
name against its permission table and does sched_set{scheduler,param}
if allowed.
This is nice because Jack gets to make the decisions about what the
appropriate priorities for its clients are (eg they can't be higher
priority than jackd, etc.) and it all gracefully falls back if the
helper isn't enabled.
