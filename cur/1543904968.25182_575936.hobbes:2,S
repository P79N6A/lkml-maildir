Hello,
today I've tried to install Slackware 12.0
As the installer just "skipped" some install steps, I tried to find the 
error.
The problem seems to be unreadable parts on the DVD:

But the DVD is OK. I've checked the MD5sum directly from disc on the 
same system using the same DVD drive.
dmesg says:
http://pastebin.com/f63c5c389
The kernel, used on the Slackware setup disk, uses SMP, but my hardware 
doesn't support this (get error on dmesg). May this (SMP kernel on 
non-SMP system) cause such bugs?
Is this a known bug? How could code, which breaks DVD access, get into 
stable 2.6.21.5?
Thanks very much in advance
CU
Manuel
