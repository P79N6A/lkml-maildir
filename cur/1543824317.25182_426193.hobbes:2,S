Does this fix observed problems on real (or fake) workloads? Can we have
some more information about that?
I still don't quite understand why all this mechanism is needed. Suppose
that we single-thread the oom kill path (which isn't unreasonable, unless
you need really good OOM throughput :P), isn't it enough to find that any
process has TIF_MEMDIE set in order to know that an OOM kill is in progress?
down(&oom_sem);
for each process {
   if TIF_MEMDIE
      goto oom_in_progress;
   else
     calculate badness;
}
up(&oom_sem);
I have one other comment, below

Is all this really required? Shouldn't you just have in place the
mechanism to prevent concurrent OOM killings in the OOM code, and
so the page allocator doesn't have to bother with it at all (ie.
it can just call into the OOM killer, which may or may not actually
kill anything).
