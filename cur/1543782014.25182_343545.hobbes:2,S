Sysfs is not like devfs by nature, it is more like procfs.  It exposes 
properties of a device, not the device itself.  It makes perfect sense that 
some of the properties should be writeable.

/dev is already busy enough without adding masses of entries that are not 
devices.  I don't see that this would simplify the internal implementation 
either, the opposite actually.  The user certainly will not have any use for 
temporary device numbers in this context.
On the other hand, it is clunky to force an application to go through the same 
parse/format interface as the user just to get/set a simple integer.  Perhaps 
sysfs needs to be taught how to ioctl these properties.  I see exposing 
property names and operating on them as orthogonal issues that are currently 
joined at the hip in an unnatural, but fixable way.

We need the mechanism that exposes subsystem instance properties as they 
appear and disappear with changing configuration.  This is a new mechanism 
anyway, so implementing it using device nodes does not save anything, it only 
introduces a new requirement to allocate device numbers.

They are, at least for putting things in /dev that are not actual hardware.
