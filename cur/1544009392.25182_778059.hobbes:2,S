Thanks for the pointer.  That makes sense, and your proposed order
makes the enable/disable paths symmetric, so I think you're right.
Can you put that spec pointer in your changelog?

Interesting.  I'd be surprised if GRUB does anything with ACPI to
disable the port.  I don't know how you determine when the port has
power.  Maybe the power-up default state is powered, and the BIOS
turns it off before launching GRUB?
I wonder if _STA is influenced by the power state.  I would think
if _STA said a device was "enabled and decoding resources," that
would only make sense if the device were already in D0.  But let's
say we start with an active device, then run _PS3 and _DIS.  What
would _STA say in the interval between _PS3 and _DIS?
This is just idle curiousity on my part, I guess.  I just don't
know much about ACPI power states, and I'm afraid of getting in
trouble if we change too much.  The _SRS path is a little less
scary because it won't be exercised much (most devices are already
enabled, and we don't change their settings).

The comment is logically unrelated to the rest of your patch, so I
would at least split it into a separate patch just on that grounds.
The PNP core *does* register IRQs: we call acpi_register_gsi()
in pnpacpi_parse_allocated_irqresource(), but there's no
corresponding unregister.  I think this asymmetry is a bug,
but I haven't looked at how to handle it yet.  PNP currently
does the registration "eagerly," when the device is discovered.
I think we should instead do the registration/unregistration
"lazily," when a driver claims the device, as PCI does.
I haven't changed this yet because there are some issues related to
pcibios_penalize_isa_irq() -- we don't know the IRQ to penalize until
we register the GSI.
Anyway, that's a long-winded explanation of why that stupid-looking
comment still has some value to me :-)
