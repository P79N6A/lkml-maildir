This looks like a known bug that is fixed in current 2.6.10
pre-releases.

It tries to use hde because it sees no reason not to.
When a drive fails, md never writes to it again, so the record of it
being part of a raid1 array is still there.
If it is assembled with another drive that "knows" that hde has
failed, then it won't accept hde into the array.  But the hdg missing,
hde is the best bet it has, and it tries it anyway.
