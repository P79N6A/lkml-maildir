David,
      Thanks. Yes, changing the types in the ipc_kludge structure would be
correct way to patch. I have incorporated the change suggested by you in my
code patch.
regards,
Sreelatha

   Yes, but Dave Millier claims that this patch is still broken, he says
the
   fix needs to be in `ipc_kludge'.  I don't have access to my source tree
   until this evening, have you looked at this?
You didn't read David's patch at all, this is exactly what he is
doing, fixing the ipc_kludge declaration.
