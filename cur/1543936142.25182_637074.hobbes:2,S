Ingo,
Is there anything else that needs to be set in the kernel config for the nmi watchdog to trigger?
I ask because I just had a hang but nothing showed on the _serial_ console - I waited a couple
of minutes before rebooting....  Is there any other way to verify the watchdog is working?
I seem to need X active with mix of 32 and 64 bit applications active to get hung here.  A massivily
threaded 64 bit java app along with 32 bit firefox and a wine active will eventually trigger things here.
If I had to guess I would say that it the switch from 32 to 64 (or vise versa) that triggers the isuue.
TIA & test/debug patches welcome,
Ed Tomlinson
