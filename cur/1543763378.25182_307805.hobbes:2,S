[PATCH] I2C: Fix race condition in it87 driver
I noticed a race condition in the it87, affecting the IT8712F chip only.
The VRM value is currently initialized *after* creating the vrm and vid
sysfs files. This leaves a theorical room for reading from these files
and get an invalid value. It's not critical, but let's still fix it.
