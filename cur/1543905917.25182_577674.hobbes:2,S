Mentioning the dvd-rom state, it comes to my mind, when rebooting from  
win, the dvd rom will close tray and  / or LED will blink on reboot.
None of that happens if I reboot from linux, so it could be a driver  
problem. I see that I have both (old and new enable in kernel), I don't  
know which is being used,
but I'll recompile kernel with just one driver and retest.
