Mmm, maybe not.

Thanks for helping me narrow the search.  On an allocate and write to 
pages of memory test, USE_3DNOW increased test time by 15% (which is
bad) on k6-2.  
Both kernels compiled with gcc-3.1.0 -march=k6-2.
mtest01 -w 50 executed 100 times 
CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW=n	745 seconds
CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW=y	860 seconds
