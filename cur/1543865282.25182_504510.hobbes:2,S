Hi all,
it would be great, if we can choose pb_fnmode while configure the
kernel. I have a PowerBook5,6 but want fkeysfirst. So I have to
# echo 2 >| /sys/module/hid/parameters/pb_fnmode
by hand after each boot. The module-parm pb_fnmode doesn't work
either in /etc/modules nor in a modprobe instruction while boot.
An modprobe -r usb-hid hid; sleep 2; modprobe hid pb_fnmode=2;
modprobe usb-hid works on a fresh booted machine.
Else module-parm isn't available with a built-in hid, though.
Thanks
Elimar
