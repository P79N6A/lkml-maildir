Hi Erik:
I applied your patch to 2.4.23 and it solved the problem. No more lost 
clusters. All data stays where it belongs.
I'll test it for a few days and get back to you later.
Thank you very much.
Torsten
For those who play with vfat filesystems now:
I noticed that fsck.vfat just pretends to repair a _mounted_ vfat 
filesystem. You have to unmount it, so it is actually repaired. An error 
message would be appropriate here. I'll contact the dosfsck maintainer, 
but I thought telling you might avoid confusion.
