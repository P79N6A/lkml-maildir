I did a test by using fsstress.
I modified the dio write() of fsstress to check return value, and input
following command;
# fsstress -d /root/testdir/ -l 0 -n 1000 -p 1000 -z -f creat=1 -f write=1 
-f dwrite=1
I got EIO from dio write.
I encountered some PostgreSQL mailing list archive that mentioned about 
this issue.
http://groups.google.com/group/pgsql.hackers/browse_thread/thread/c7515ccd5ac1269c/dc2ddeac3fe0d8c1?lnk=raot&fwc=1
dio can be used in PostgreSQL to write transaction log(WAL). It is said 
that when dio is used,
EIO is returned under some workload.
