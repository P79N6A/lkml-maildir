The 2.3 code is being re-worked as we speak.
This will submitted to DaveM soon pending acceptance from the other
peers. The redesign includes accomodating more than just PPPOE;
Look at the netdev archives for a thread on PPPOX. 
The 2.2 code is pretty stable and unrelated to the changes in 2.3;
The plan is to submit that as well as soon as Michal has the 2.3 patches
and the other folks find them meeting their requirements. 
cheers,
jamal
