Try to make them releasing more, pointing out that
holding onto almost anything concerning the kernel could
be dangerous for them.  They can keep the userspace
part secret if they have to, of course.

Correct.

If the driver supports your custom piece of hardware, then you can
safely release the driver.  Your competitors don't have that
hardware, after all.  Releasing the driver can only increase sales,
because then customers know that the driver will be available
and fixable even if your company should stop supporting it sometime.
(Happens when companies die, and often when they release newer hardware.)
Smart customers think like this, and skip the closed stuff.
Remember, you don't make money from selling software.  You make it
from selling hardware.  Open free drivers will sell more hardware - simple!

Sad.
