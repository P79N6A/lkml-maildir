My own lspci says:
  02:00.0 IDE interface: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Unknown device 
6101 (rev b1)
and the DVD works:
  Unknown: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:02:00.0
  ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:00.0[A] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 169
  Unknown: chipset revision 177
  Unknown: 100% native mode on irq 169

Since  I'm running a Fedora kernel, you might want to look at their 
patchlist and .config.  I briefly ran mainline, but I can't remember if 
I accessed the drive while running that.
