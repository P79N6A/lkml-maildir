Hmm, I just unpacked fresh sources from kernel.org, patched them up to 
rc3 and everything is now working fine. Seems like my kernel sources 
were in some way damaged from patching too much although I didn't 
experience any rejects.
Sorry for the noise.
Well, I guess next time I should really make sure that everything's sane 
before reporting something.

Yes, this one works well without any problems or warnings. Thanks.
