It's a good example of the problems, but a bad example of problems
caused be kernel maintenance.  
RedHat does not run stock linux kernels, but instead seems to patch
the kernel to include work-around for various known bugs and
deficiencies.  What this means is that they are more willing than the
mainstream kernel developers to include changes to the kernel.  A
example that comes to mind are the md drivers that implement software
raid. 
So for solutions (That I know of):
With recent kernels with modules_install a:
 /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
directory is created, that effectively points to the kernel source
tree the modules were built with.  With the 2.4.x currently this is a
symlink so but it should be o.k.  It needs to be checked that the
distributors are using this directory appropriately, but it looks like
a good thing to support.  Longterm this looks like a solution
to the problem, of how to get kernel headers to match a kernel.  
This should even has a chance to work with people who build their own
kernel.
With Redhat and many derivatives as a fallback there is kernel source in 
/usr/src/linux that does it's best to match the currently running
kernel.
Using either of those locations for the source to kernel headers it
should be possible to build a package that as part of it's install
process compiles appropriate drivers, at least for most of the cases.
I suspect there is enough work in this for someone to create a support
package, that included makefiles and all the rest to assist in
building a drivers on various platforms.  Any takers?
Eric.
