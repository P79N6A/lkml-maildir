some questions:
a.   the list of parameters can presumably be extracted from existing
file via "procname" search.....not sure if it is correct (as per
attached, complete?)
b.   what is the diff between /proc and /sys?   in
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt....it is mentioned that /proc
information will be published into a book...where is it?   I can never
understand this.
c.   in Doc/sysctl are all the explanation for /proc/sys/* .... as a
start i think we shall contribute fixing here....but according to your
email, we should fix Doc/ABI...so I supposed some migration is needed?
d.   In networking/ip-sysctl.txt a lot of the explanation for the
attached procname's parameters are explained, may be we can relocate
it to ABI?
