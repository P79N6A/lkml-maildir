	Hi guys,
	I enabled ACPI support and get "ACPI: support found" on boot followed 	
by
	"ACPI: namespace load failed". I don't know ACPI spec. I enabled ACPI 	
in the BIOS and the motherboard manual (GA 6BXD) says it does support 	
ACPI.
Same here, also this in /var/adm/debug
This is on an IBM Thinkpad 380D
