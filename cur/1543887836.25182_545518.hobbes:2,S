What i didn't agree with was the dependency on the acpi P-state driver 
for single socket multi-core systems, where in the original post of this 
thread, Joshua was stating that smp systems required that driver.   
Later it was found that the acpi p-state driver was only being used to 
enforce the dependency on the acpi_processor driver ...which is the 
actual driver we care about (dependency wise).  
So yes, I do agree with your patch, in so far as my experience with the 
hardware.
