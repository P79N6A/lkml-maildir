I removed the complete drivers/cdrom directory for x86-64 now, as it seems to 
contain no PCI code at all. For i386 it can be made dependent on CONFIG_ISA.
Also I did this change for the IDE configuration (assuming that there 
are no boxes with no ISA but a VLB slot). I hope this covers all 
ISA/VLB only adapters for IDE.
You may want to incorporate it.
