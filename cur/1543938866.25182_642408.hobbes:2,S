You're only thinking of current code.  The BUG catches future changes, too.

That's why I did the audit.  See patch below which preceeded it, which Jeff
hasn't responded to.  Breaking his drivers might make him notice :)

At end of cycles, sure, but not for 2.6.25: they're even more invisible than
deprecated warnings :(

request_irq() always returns -EINVAL with a NULL handler.
I assume that these ancient network drivers were trying to find out if
an irq is available.  eepro.c expecting +EBUSY was doubly wrong.
Request_irq should BUG() on bad input, and these would have been found
earlier.
