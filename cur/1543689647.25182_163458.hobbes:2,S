Won't we get a linker error if a static symbol is used but
optimized-away?  It shouldn't be hard to fix the n linker errors that
crop up.
And why are we using static symbols in inline assembly outside of the
compilation scope?
Anyhow, if it generates an error, this isn't hard to fix.
Here is the start...
