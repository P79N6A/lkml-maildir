Chuck, if you really want to talk about this let's take it off line,
the rest of the kernel list doesn't need to know your opinion of our
docs or tools.  Last I heard, they were pretty sick of any sort of BK
discussion that wasn't focussed on solving kernel problems.
For the rest of you, if you want something fixed in BK a few ways
to get that done: file a bug|rfe with "bk sendbug", ask questions on
bitkeeper-users at bitmover.com list, and/or send mail to support at
bitmover.
It's probably obvious but bears repeating: polite people tend to
get better support than impolite people, just something to consider.
It's not our policy to distinguish, we fix bugs regardless of how they
are reported, but if you are more or less asking us to do some work for
you we'll put the nice people at the head of the list, that's just
human nature.  FYI.
