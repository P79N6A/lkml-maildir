Pretty much - we need to work out what is going wrong and
we can't from teh shutdown message above - the error has
occurred in a path that doesn't have error report traps
in it.
Is this reproducable?

Ok. Sounds like we need more error reporting points inserted
into that code so we dump an error earlier and hence have some
hope of working out what went wrong next time.....
OOC, there weren't any I/O errors reported before this shutdown?
Cheers,
Dave.
