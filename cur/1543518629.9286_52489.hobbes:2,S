It is supported in recent 2.3 kernels.
You need the latest nfs-utils
    
ftp://ftp.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org/pub/nfs/nfs-utils-0.1.4.tar.gz
and set the "nohide" export option on filesystems that you don't want
to be hidden.
Support is incomplete in that it only works properly if you export the
filesystems to specific hosts. Exporting to netgroups or wildcarded
domain names wont work (yet).
Also, not all nfs clients will cope with seeing different filesystems
under what they expect to be only one filesystem.
