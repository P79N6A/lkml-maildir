>Hard disk recording. 
Do you know anyone who does professional HDR on a computer ? I don't,
and everything I've read in EM and Mix suggests that nobody in their
right minds does this. Protools interfaced with a computer, Paris
interfaced with a computer, yes, but thats not what we're talking about.
>Audio/MIDI sequencers. 
MIDI sequencing is not a problem, or rather, its certainly not a deep
problem. Audio is, however.
>"Cool" Windoze/Mac DAW style
These all rely on external hardware if they do the job
right. Furthermore, many of these packages are soundfile editors
and playback systems, not real-time processing systems. Linux can do
this stuff OK already, though I guess there are still playback
problems to be fully solved.
>Yeah, Kyma/Capybara looks pretty nice. Can you send me a system? ;-)
I'm about to buy one. I'm setting up the first semi-pro Linux-based
recording studio :) We'll be using Windows or Mac stuff for a while
and then gradually move into a 100% Linux configuration as I manage to
get Creamware (Scope) and Symbolic Sound (Kyma) to co-operate :)
>BTW, do you think you can expect a UN*X-like programming environment
>when programming Kyma plug-ins?
No. Its a graphical system. You build stuff with the mouse, then the
Mac/Windows software compiles it down to 56309 code, and ships it over
the wire to the Capybara.

I want the same things. I'm just not sure that I want to use RTL to do
it. But I'll think more about it.

thats my general plan, yes :) i think seagate cheetahs are about it
for now (5ms seek time, they fly!)
