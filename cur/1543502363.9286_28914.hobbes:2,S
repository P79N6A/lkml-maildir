Hmm, "also" ....
I have tried, but unfortunately it does not work under Intel architecture as
a module (init_mm used by pgd_offset_k not exported). This is easy to fix in
2.3 (export init_mm), but for me more important is 2.0-2.3 portability, so I
will stick to the older version. 
Could someone explain me why in 2.3.10 include/asm-i386/page.h   ?:
#define __pa(x)                 ((unsigned long)(x)-PAGE_OFFSET)
#define __va(x)                 ((void *)((unsigned long)(x)+PAGE_OFFSET))
while in include/asm-i386/io.h
#define __io_virt(x)            ((void *)(PAGE_OFFSET | (unsigned long)(x)))
#define __io_phys(x)            ((unsigned long)(x) & ~PAGE_OFFSET)
(used by phys_to_virt and virt_to_phys). Why __io_virt is not just defined as
__va ? I find all that different names and implementations for same thing
highly confusing.  IO-mapping.txt mentiones only the phys_to_virt and
virt_to_phys. What for are the other macros?
