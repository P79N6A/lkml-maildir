No, it doesn't require Perl.  Its sh along with the standard Linux
toolset.  xconfig is Tk, but not binded to Perl.
Regardless, I don't look at bloat as the issue -- who configures and
compiles their kernel on an embedded device?  More specifically, it is
what the kernel hackers have available and want to use that is the
requirement.  This is partly why the whole "now your mom can easily
configure her kernel" is a bs argument to me.  Forget my mom..._I_ want
things a certain way.  My mom, if I ever forc^H^H^H^H get her to use
Linux, will surely use the distro's kernel.
