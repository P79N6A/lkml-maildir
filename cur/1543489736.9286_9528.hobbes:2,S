Just use the glibcbug script that comes with every glibc installation
to report a complete bug report.

Why can't people read?  The glibc source distribution contains a
README, a FAQ, an INSTALL file,... and installs the glibcbug script for 
bug reporting.  You can even (ok, that doesn't work with some glibc
2.0.x versions) execute your libc, like /lib/libc.so.6 to get
information about it.
