I find myself still not understanding this thread. Lots of examples of
code that should or should not be used, but I would always choose:
   ... ensure file descriptor is blocking ...
   for (;;) {
       int nread = read(...);
       ...
   }
Over the above, or any derivative of the above.
What would be the point of using an event notification mechanism for
synchronous reads with no other multiplexed options?
A 'proper' event loop is significantly more complicated. Since everybody
here knows this... I'm still confused...
