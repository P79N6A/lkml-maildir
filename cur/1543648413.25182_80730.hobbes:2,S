1.8GHz Xeon and above have HyperThreading implemented.  Below that
processors may show the 'ht' bit in /proc/cpuinfo, but don't actually have
HT implemented on the chip.  There's a secondary call you have to make to
get the count of actual logical processors implemented - the 'ht' bit means
that the architecture is ht-capable. :-)
Thanks,
Matt
