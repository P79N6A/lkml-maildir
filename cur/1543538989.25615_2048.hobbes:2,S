   I believe this patch is safe for all platforms, but I'm not 100%
   sure, so I thought it would be good to put it up for
   testing/discussion.
It will not break sparc64 running 32-bit apps since it is safe to load
elf binaries using an 8k page size even for them, and that is what we
set it up to do.  So the result is that your change should have no
change in behavior for this case.
