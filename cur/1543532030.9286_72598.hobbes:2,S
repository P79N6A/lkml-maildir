Sorry......brain reaction......
Yes, goes in and sets/truncates the total drive capactity at the 32GB
limit, and the NVRAM is set with VV == 0 to hold the settings regardless
of power cycle or whatever.
The setting of VV == 1 will allow it to revert to the "previous" capacity
issued before the most recent SET_MAX_ADDRESS.
Original was 40GB
Call SET_MAX_ADDRESS to set/get 32GB VV == 0
while (!VV)
  power cycles always returns 32GB
Later :: Set VV == 1
power cycles always returns 40GB
It does seem possibble to call any capacity "TWICE" the is key, and then
call it a "THIRD" time with a different value and set VV == 0 and then
later set VV == 1 and you are stuck........
40GB
SET_MAX_ADDRESS >> 35GB  VV == 0
SET_MAX_ADDRESS >> 35GB  VV == 0
SET_MAX_ADDRESS >> 32GB  VV == 0
VV == 1 >> SET_MAX_ADDRESS == 35GB
I am asking both Quantum and Maxtor to clarify the possible case, above...
