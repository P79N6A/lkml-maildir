Thanks for teh replies, but I don't think that it is a cable or HD
issue.  I installed 6.1 on the same machine and had no DMA problems what
so ever.  Let me get to the root of why I installed 6.0 after 6.1.
The good engineers at MathWorks said that they have not tested MATLab
release 11.1 under RH6.1.  They told me to go to 6.0 or earlier.  I was
having problems getting my license server runner on a stand alone
machine.
So, if anybody has experience in this area, the help would be greatly
appreciated.
Thanks,
Chuck
