Exactly my point. The device number stored in the inode is just a
number. Then you have to lookup the corresponding kdev_t
structure. In fact what happens is we lookup by major. Right now with
8 bit majors we have a table. If we go to 12 or 16 bit majors, we'll
have a list instead. So the lookup is no longer trivial.
Devfs completely avoids this.
