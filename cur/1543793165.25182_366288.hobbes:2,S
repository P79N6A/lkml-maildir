Subject: inode kernel option for HA clustering/rsync

I'm working on a clustering project which utilizes rsync for system 
mirroring.  A main priority is to reduce rsync runtime and IO load.  I have 
heard of a kernel 'inode' option which can be used to cache a list of 
modified files.  The list of files is then passed to rsync on the next run.  
Has anyone heard of this kernel option.  Thanks in advance.
