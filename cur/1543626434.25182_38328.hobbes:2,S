(*) sometimes with dvd/avi/video software and with opening/closeing the
display and with changeing to console/back to x, the screen gets wiered:
in a vertical cut, maybe 30% of the middle of the screen is missing,
filled with a duplication of the right part. everything still works, but
that 30% of the screen is not shown. after a reboot everything is ok,
sometimes a close display/open display helps.
