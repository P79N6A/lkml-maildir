and if your local non-root user can create a hard link to /etc/shadow and 
access it they own your box anyway (they can just set the root password to 
anything they want). since I don't hear about this happening there are 
other restrictions that prevent this anyway.
everyone recognises that AA has limits, but the way people are 
emphisising these acknowledged limits is beginning to sound a bit shrill.
