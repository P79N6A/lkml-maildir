Hi there.
Enclosed is a patch that provides the first stage of the procedure
required to successfully compile kernels with bzImage where the
compressed kernel image is greater than 1M in size. However, one
should note that this is only the first stage of the relevant
procedure.
This stage implements the relevant tweaks to build.c to allow suchlike
kernels to be built, and causes the warning that suchlike kernels
currently can not be booted from the in-built boot loader to be
issued, but does not prevent the build procedure from completing.
It also implements the necessary changes to the parameters table at
the end of bootsect.S ready for the tweaks to the boot sector to allow
it to boot suchlike kernels, and correctly specifies the maximum size
of the bzImage format kernel image as being 15 Megabytes, which is the
limit imposed by the BIOS routine used to load suchlike kernels on the
i386 architecture.
I had done a lot more work on this patch, but lost the results with a
CPU failure last week that killed my hard disk in the process. I am
therefore reworking this from scratch.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below.
