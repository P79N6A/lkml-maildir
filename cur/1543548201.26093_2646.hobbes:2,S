I happen to like that point of view.  I use the GPLv2 myself extensively
for the same reason.

Here I am concerned.  I'm concerned about the other authors.
You often accept contributions to your kernel where the license isn't
specified by the contributor.  We must assume the contributor is content
with the kernel's own license.
Now, someone may contribute a large patch to your GPLv2 kernels.  The
person has _not_ granted you the right to retroactively change _their_
license to "v2-v3".
Maybe it seems reasonable to relicense contributed code from "v2 only"
to "v2-v3".  But is it really?  It seems _far_ from reasonable to
relicense contributed code to a non-GPL license.  So what makes it
reasonable to relax the version?

I assumed as much.
For the moment may I propose an interim statement?
You state that _your_ code is clearly GPL "v2 only", but you might
change your mind.
Let's state that others' _contributed_ code is GPL "v2 or later" unless
the contributor states otherwise.  So that, if you do decide to go with
GPLv3 later, you actually have permission to do that.
It would be good anyway to have a clear statement on the status of
contributed code.  It is most of the kernel.
