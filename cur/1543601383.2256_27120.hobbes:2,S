Hi,
Seems like there is a lot of code "ready" for consideration in a 2.5 kernel.
I can think of:
premptable kernel option
user mode kernel 
jfs
xfs (maybe)
rc2
reverse maping vm
ide driver rewrite
32bit dma
LTT (maybe)
LVM update to 1.01
ELVM (maybe)
module security stuff
UP friendly SMP scheduler
What else?
TIA
Ed Tomlinson
