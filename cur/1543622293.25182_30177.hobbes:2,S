You might want to try out the swsusp patch by Pavel Machek.
It is the beta (or even alpha) stage, but according to Pavels
latest comments it is starting to work quite well.
From the patch:
+Software Suspend
+CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
+  Enable the possibilty of suspendig machine. It doesn't need APM.
+  You may suspend your machine by either pressing Sysrq-d or with
+  'swsusp' or 'shutdown -z <time>' (patch for sysvinit needed). It
+  creates an image which is saved in your active swaps. By the next
+  booting the kernel detects the saved image, restores the memory from
+  it and then it continues to run as before you've suspended.
+  If you don't want the previous state to continue use the 'noresume'
+  kernel option. However note that your partitions will be fsck'd and
+  you must re-mkswap your swap partitions/files.
Regards,
Toon.
