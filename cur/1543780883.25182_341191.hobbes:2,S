The problem is that the default stack size was reduced to 4kB. The local 
arrays allocated by the driver eat 2kB each, so a stack overflow is very 
likely. Even with 8kB stack it is still not impossible. Using the version 
from 2.6.5 will not be a very good idea I think, it's likely to crash your 
machine one day.
The right solution would be fixing the driver to use kmalloc()/kfree() when he 
really needs the memory. There was a patch only a few days ago that tried to 
do that, but it was not really well done and would have crashed. If you are 
really interested in I can do such a patch. The code of this driver sucks 
universes through nanotubes, but one day someone _will_ have to start 
cleaning this up.
