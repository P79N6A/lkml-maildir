I have similar problem with my swim3 floppy drive. Digging deeply I found that
when I make do folowing steps then disk is lost and I have to reboot to get it
back:
floppy = open(/dev/fd0);
ioctl( floopy, FDGETDRVPRM, &fdp) /* some *invalid* ioctl */
exit
Device is lost for root too. It is impossible to make any operation on this
device anymore. And adding some debuging messages showed me that there is no
problem in swim3 device driver. Still digging...(but have no much time to do
this ;-( )
