Read the help
config X86_MCE
        bool "Machine check support" if EMBEDDED
        default y
        help
           Include a machine check error handler to report hardware errors.
           This version will require the mcelog utility to decode some
           machine check error logs. See

Your distribution is broken then. In fact it is supposed to run
mcelog regularly from a cronjob to log machine check events into
a disk log. Complain to them.
