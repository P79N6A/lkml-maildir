Hello,
I've been trying to get an answer to this on comp.os.linux.networking,
but without success. So I give it a try here:
On my Linux workstation with a Thunderlan 100TX network card, I try to
read/write to our NFS servers (IRIX, Solaris) on another network
segment.
However when writing, it stalls after a few kilobytes, and the writing
process on the Linux client hangs. I've tried this with various 2.2.x
kernels (up to 2.2.10).
Someone hinted this may have to do with the fact that the server is on
another segment, which is only 10MBit.
I have tried all possible NFS options (such as small read/write
blocksizes) without improvement.
NFS clients from other operating systems (NT, FreeBSD) on my
workstation do not have this problem.
Is this a known issue? Could it be a 2.2 specific bug, i.e. would it
make sense to try 2.0.36?
