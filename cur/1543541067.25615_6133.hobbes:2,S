Subject: IDE Tape problem in 2.2.16 (bug?)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm using a Seagate IDE tape drive (I understand it's basically a Travan
tape drive) on kernel 2.2.16, and when I read from it, it doesn't read the
last 18k from my backups; everything else seems to work.
The drive worked back in kernel 2.2.5, but I understand that ide_tape.c
(if that is indeed the problem) has changed a couple of times since then.
I've tried it with the latest (8/5/00) ide patches as well.
Here's the information the kernel prints for this:
Aug  8 10:06:52 www6 kernel: ide-tape: hdb <-> ht0: Seagate STT8000A rev 5.51 
Aug  8 10:06:52 www6 kernel: ide-tape: hdb <-> ht0: 600KBps, 14*26kB buffer, 5850kB pipeline, 80ms tDSC, DMA 
During testing, I also get some other messages, too.  I understand
they have to do with drive locking?
Aug  8 14:41:04 www6 kernel: ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc = 1e, key =  5, asc = 20, ascq =  0

I originally talked to the BRU people about this, and they told me it was
a known issue with later kernel versions, and that 2.2.7 doesn't have this bug.
This is what I do to test it:
	mt rewind
	dd if=/dev/full of=full.dat bs=2048 count=100
	mt rewind
	dd if=full.dat of=/dev/ht0 bs=2048 count=100
	mt rewind
	dd if=/dev/ht0 of=full.rest bs=2048 count=100
...and this is the output I get:
	100+0 records in
	100+0 records out
	100+0 records in
	100+0 records out
	91+0 records in
	91+0 records out
It stops reading once it gets to the last 9 blocks (18k).
Could anyone verify that this is a bug with the kernel, or try to fix it?
I tried looking at the code, but as I'm not really familiar with it, I'd
rather not cause a kernel panic on a live server.  :)
Thanks in advance,
