I'll fix it up this time, but in future could you trailing whitespace
check your patches? (git will do this for you).
Also, when you do a git workflow, the body of the email becomes the
commit message, so things like this

while no doubt being useful to the members of linux-scsi who are
actually unable to count aren't actually useful in commit messages.
