RHAT probably fixed Emacs already since it broke on them.  Adamantix and
Hardened Gentoo are most likely to put manpower into things like pine..
they put a lot of work into removing textrels on i386.
Oracle we can't do anything about.  It's commercial.  If we break it,
they will recommend running it on Solaris or Windows 2003.

Yes but when you misconfigure IDE the system doesn't boot.  When you
turn up randomization too high, everything works but 1 or 2 programs.
You bitch to your distro or to the upstream programmer and they tell you
"It won't function like that, do this" or "We don't know right now" and
you make the connection and turn it back down or wind up here.
If you get that far, at least you know what you did and how to undo it.

On x86-64 he may, if you can convince him it's useful (asserting that
turning entropy up on i386 is non-useful is not a good start hinthint).
 On i386 or other 32-bit where TASK_SIZE is a few GiB, no chance in
hell, but it'd be nice to be able to tweak it upwards if desired.
