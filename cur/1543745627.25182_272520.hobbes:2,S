On some architectures -- this is a porting issue, and not a clean binary
distinction.
ASSUMES_32_BIT or some other "32 bit" name would probably better capture
this particular issue.
Even better might be to get the compiler to catch the most obvious
mistakes and use #define decorations to override the compiler's
determination (you'd need two of these, because the compiler can get
this wrong in two different ways).
