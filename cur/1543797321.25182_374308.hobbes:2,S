It might be, there's no guarantee not.  So if it was written back just
before you did your own dirtying of the page, you do need to set page dirty
again after (usually when releasing the pages got).  And get_user_pages is
a typical case when set_page_dirty_lock is really needed - you don't
usually have any hold on the inode (if any) that backs those pages.
It can be very inconvenient (I don't know what to do for drivers/scsi/sg.c
than set_page_dirty and hope for the best, since it cannot wait for a lock
where it needs to).  But I'm afraid you do have the very case where
set_page_dirty_lock is appropriate.
Many would be pleased if we could manage without set_page_dirty_lock.

What if you are?
