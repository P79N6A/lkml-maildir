Actually, if the recent 9th circuit court ruling stands, the
U.S. government will find itself pretty effectively corrected on that
score.  It's going to take a while to settle out, but the U.S. crypto
export laws may well be on their way out.
What that would do, of course, is highlight the fact that the U.S. is not
the only country out there with weird crypto laws.  It still may not be
possible to put crypto into the standard kernel.
