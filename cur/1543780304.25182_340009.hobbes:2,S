I'm just trying to get rid of as much code duplication as possible.

I was focussing on creating a whole Xen stack before looking at
your stuff much, then seeing what was common between them, as I
think it's a bit hard to read the current Xen code because of the
copied files. Unfortunately, is going to be harder then I thought
to maintain that stack out of tree, so I wanted to shovel out
the basic refactoring stuff. Then the line got a bit blurred.
Humpf. And this is the easy part. Damn it.
Doing the whole thing and comparing is going to be a total PITA.
Perhaps the right thing to do is go one file at a time, and sync
up on that basis.

Heh, is similar, considering we're working from completely different
angles. I'm just refactoring the current code without changing it
too much at first, we can make it more robust later. otherwise it's
going to be a pig to review if we mix those up.

I can easily leave those bits out. There's going to be lots of bits common
with std i386, and bits that are common amongst the hypervisor layers,
then bits that are specific. Hopefully more bits that are common, but
still.
Humpf. I shall go back into my corner and have a rethink. Will read through
your patches some more, then send you some email.
