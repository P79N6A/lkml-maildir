Obviously :)
I already have stuff working fine w/o the Rules.make include, I'm just
trying to do the "right thing"

Doesn't work for 2.2. Hopefully I will be able to specify M_OBJS in
addition.
Also, you don't specify O_TARGET ?
Given :
TOPDIR=/usr/src/linux
THISDIR=/tmp/mod
O_TARGET=lartmod.o
obj-m := lart.o blah.o
include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make
all:
        (cd $(TOPDIR) && $(MAKE) SUBDIRS=/tmp/mod modules)
a) default target for Rules.make doesn't do anything useful
b) lartmod.o is never made (how could I convince it to ?)
c) is this going to work OK for modversions...
d) the above seems to disallow a lart.c forming only part of a final lart.o target
e) there seems something is going horribly wrong :
moz mod 317 make all
make: execvp: /usr/src/linux/scripts/pathdown.sh: Permission denied
¶@¶@re/locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/make.mo(cd /usr/src/linux && make SUBDIRS=/tmp/mod modules)
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.0'
The above problems is why I asked for working examples :)

john
