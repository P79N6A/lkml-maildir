Hello!
I need some assistance with creating a RAM disk of 8G
and mounting it.  I am using 2.6.10 with this
proceedure:
(ramdisk support enabled)
dd bs=512 if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram0 count=16384000
mkfs.ext2 -m0 /dev/ram0 8192000
mount -t ext2 /dev/ram0 /ramdisk0
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on
/dev/ram0,
       or too many mounted file systems
I am not sure what the issue is.  It worked on the
2.4.x series.
Any help if greatly appreciated!
TIA!
Phy
