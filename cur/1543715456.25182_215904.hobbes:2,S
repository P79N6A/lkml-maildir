So you'd like to see 2 syscalls:
  fmount(dev, dst, type, flags, data)
  ftransmount(src, dst, flags)  (bind + move)
About the flag splitting: you mean per-mountpoint and per-superblock
flags?  Does the user care?  The user may not even know which flag is
which.  E.g. currently MS_NOATIME and MS_RDONLY are superblock flags,
but in the future they may become mountpoint flags.
Thanks for your comments!
