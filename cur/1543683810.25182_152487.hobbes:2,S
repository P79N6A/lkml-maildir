Hello,
> 2.4.21 still works fine.
I do have watchdog complaints (no resets) with 2.4.21 too. I do not have
access to the box atm, but I suspect NFS since I did experience I/O
errors on copying large files (there was a discussion on lkml about NFS
problems, but I have not followed it)
regards
	Stefan
