I recently wrote a kernel module which gave me some mysterious problems.
After too many days spent in blood, sweat and tears, I found the cause:
*** one of my data structures has a field named 'current'. ***
Pretty common word, isn't it? Would you think it can cause such a
trouble? But in some of my files I happen to indirectly include
<asm/current.h> (kernel 2.4.18 for i386), containing the following line:
#define current get_current()
so that my structure becomes the owner of a function it has never asked
for, while it looses a data member. gcc has nothing to complain about
that.
In some other files I don't happen to include <asm/current.h>, so that
there my structure is sound - but alas! has different size and different
composition. Again, gcc has nothing to complain.
Moral of the story: in my opinion kernel developers should reduce to a
minimum the use of #define, and preferably use words in uppercase and/or
with underscores, in any case not commonly used words.
In the specific case the said #define just looks to save 6 keystrokes
and I think it could have been completely avoided.
