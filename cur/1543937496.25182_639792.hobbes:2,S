I think we should intentionally do this test once in a while. Two days
ago I was informed that 2.6.20.21 (the latest 2.6.20 I pushed 3 months
ago) was not clonable nor pullable due to a problem with the HEAD
pointing to latest tag instead of latest commit. Since the error was
also present in my local tree, I'm certain that it remained there
unnoticed for 3 months !
Cheers,
Willy
