[patch snipped. It looks fine]
Tachino,
Thanks for the patch. Alan Cox has incorporated it in lk 2.4.5-ac9 .
The problem only occurs when the sg driver is built in. [I do my
testing with sg built as a module.]
Currently sg version 3.1.18 is in the ac tree while the previous
version (3.1.17) is in the main branch. The code that oopsed is
there to temporarily bump the sg module count to inhibit rmmod
(and/or autoclean) until all SCSI commands on that device are
finished.
