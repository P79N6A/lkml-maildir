Hi.
I have LiteOn 40x12x48x cd-writer, linux 2.4.19, cdrecord 1.11a24,
Duron 1000 MHz, ECS K7S5A with SIS735 chipset. My cd-writer works fine only 
in two cases:
1. when the speed is not higher than 12x (no matter if the dma is on)
2. with speed = 32x but only when I turn the dma off with hdparm
In other cases after a few whiles from the begining of burning process
the whole system crashes whith such messages:
"unable to handle paging request at virtual address 199EC3F7"
"oops: 0002"
"kernel panic: aiee, killing interrupt handler!"
Can you give me any advices what should I do with that?
