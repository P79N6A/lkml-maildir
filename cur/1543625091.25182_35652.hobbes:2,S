Indeed it can be...  but it less flexible that way, unless you want to 
add another level of indirection.
It is far better for future-proofing the interface IMO if fadvise is 
implementing directly.  Hints are less important than open O_xxx flags 
or F_xxx flags, because an implementation can safely ignore 100% of the 
fadvise hints, if it so chooses.  One cannot say the same thing for 
open/fcntl flags.
So, different class of fd flags deserves a different syscall, IMO...
