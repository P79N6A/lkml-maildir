No malloc'ing, etc?  OK.  Then yes, please create some sort of merged
patchset (I don't know how Andrew wants to handle it, maybe just replace
the core patch?)

memcpy(src, src, size) isn't good, is it?  On i386 we start out with the
commandline in saved_command_line.  Everyone else I believe has a local
var we point cmdline_p at, which gets copied into saved_command_line.
