Subject: [BUG] 2.5.42+ reboot kills Dell Latitude keyboard

Dell Latitude CPi laptop. Boot 2.5.42 or .43, then reboot.
Shortly after the screen is blanked and the BIOS starts, it
prints a "keyboard error" message and requests an F1 or F2
response (continue or go into SETUP). Never happened with any
other kernel on that machine.
Apparently the 2.5.42+ "let's shut everything down at reboot"
change put the keyboard controller in a state which is inconsistent
with the BIOS' expections at a warm boot.
First the disks-spun-down-at-reboot bug and now this. Sigh.
