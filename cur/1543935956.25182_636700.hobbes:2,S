because the PAT (Page Attribute Table support) patchset and the CPA 
(change_page_attr()) patchset are are not orthogonal at all - as their 
name already signals: because they change the implementation/effects of 
the same interface(s). [just at different levels].
Both patchsets change how the kernel pagetable caching is handled. PAT 
changes the kernel pte details and unshackles us from MTRR reliance and 
thus solves real problems on real boxes:
 55 files changed, 1288 insertions(+), 237 deletions(-)
CPA moves change_page_attr() from invwb flushing to cflush flushing, for 
a speedup/latency-win, plus a whole bunch of intermingled fixes and 
improvements to page attribute modification:
 26 files changed, 882 insertions(+), 423 deletions(-)
so in terms of risk management, the "perfect patch order" is:
 - minimal_set of correctness fixes to the highlevel cpa code.
 - ( then any provably NOP cleanups to pave the way. )
 - then change the lowlevel pte code (PAT) to reduce/eliminate the need 
   to have runtime MTRR use
 - then structural improvements/cleanups of the highlevel cpa code
 - then the cflush (optional) performance feature ontop of it.
 - then gigabyte-largepages/TLBs support [new CPU feature that further
   complicates page-attribute management]
All in an easy-to-revert fashion. We _will_ regress here, and this stuff 
is very hard to debug.
