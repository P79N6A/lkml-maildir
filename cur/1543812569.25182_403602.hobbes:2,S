Ok, it /seems/ that things are happier (though still not entirely happy) 
if I explicitly acknowledge the interrupt by writing the dma status 
register back again. This doesn't seem to be done anywhere in the IDE 
interrupt routine, but is in the libata one. I'm afraid I don't 
understand IDE well enough to have any idea what's going on here - is it 
possible that a piix in native mode (rather than legacy mode) and 
sharing an interrupt needs some special handling?
