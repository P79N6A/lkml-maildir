Well, if it behaves like a normal PS/2 mouse, it is quite possibly
working :-)  
That patch didn't add any obvious new functionality.  It just change
things to the ALPS device was used in absolute mode.
If you manage to find evtest.c, you can watch events on
/dev/input/event1 (or similar) and see the absolute event.
The next step is adding scroll-edge functionality and similar things
to mousedev.c 
I've almost got it so that when yor finger hits the edge of the
touchpad, the mouse keeps moving, and moves faster if you press
harder.   Once I'm happy with that I'll post it and start on the
scroll-wheel thing.

No, the device isn't detected exactly.  See point 2 in the original
mail.
