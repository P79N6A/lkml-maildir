Hi Ingo,
Yes, and I replied that I really don't think that a few cycles saved here and
there by a predicted branch will change anything significant compared to the
int3 cost. As my test bench is really not that hard to deploy (I have given the
precise instructions to do so), I assume that the burden of the proof is on your
side there.
Anyhow, I prefer to move to a more constructive matter than testing kprobes
branch optimisations.
Mathieu
