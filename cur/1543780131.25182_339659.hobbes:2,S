ISTR making comments before about the offending patch on linux-pci mailing
list.  Is this the same patch that assumes pci_dev->resource[i] == BAR[i] ?
That's not true for 64-bit bars.

*lots* of PCI device now have 64-bit BAR.
The first I'm aware of was LSI 53c896 card (Ultra 2 SCSI).

Assigning 4GB+ regions is uncommon because too often
either the HW, the OS, or the driver would break.
firmware keeps having to worry about legacy OSs.
