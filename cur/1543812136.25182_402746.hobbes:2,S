Do you get any output at all from mkfs.ext3?
Can you try mkfs.ext2 and mkreiserfs?
Can you try to mkfs the whole disk? (/dev/hda)
Can you try 'dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=1k' ?
What controller do you have? (lspci -v)
Can you swap the controller or is it onboard?
Can you try a vanilla kernel?
Maybe this helps to get more info about what you experience.
