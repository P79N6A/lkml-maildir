  Only parameters of the form foo=bar will be set as environment variables (if not
recognized by the kernel).
  AFAIK Red Hat scripts grab parameters of different form from /proc/cmdline.
  But parameter of the form network=dhcp will be set as environment variable and
 this is IMHO the easiest way how to get the parameter value in startup scripts.
