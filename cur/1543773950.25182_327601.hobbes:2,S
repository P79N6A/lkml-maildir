I admit to severe dislike for any backup tool which crosses file system
borders without permission, and therefore am not going to cry if something
breaks because of this.
Ditto updatedb/locate -- it's a remote file system. Tools should
treat it as such.
NB: I am assuming that root can stat() the mountpoint and that it's not
possible to delay this call arbitrarily. If not, the debate IMHO should be
whether to special-case this situation.
