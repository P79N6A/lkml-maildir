Can you try to see where it is waiting? "ctrl + scrollock" while outside X 
should get you a call trace of all the processes in the system, and it 
would be interesting to see what seems to trigger the iowait. So if you do 
the scrollock thing a few times while the system is spending 99% in 
iowait, the results should show where the processes ended up actually 
waiting for IO.
Now, it's entirely possible that the IO waits are there in 2.4.x too, but 
that driver breakage or just IO scheduler breakage makes them much 
_bigger_ in 2.6.x. In which case you won't see anything very interesting.
But we've also had a few cases where the IO gets throttled for totally 
different reasons - implementing FDATASYNC incorrectly, for example, or 
just having the memory allocator throttle on IO too aggressively (the 
latter usually leads to much nicer interactive usage, but can hurt 
throughput a lot).
