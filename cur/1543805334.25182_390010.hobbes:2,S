Serious question, what and how?  If I scan /sys/block for example for
potential candidates, that won't give me the devices or tell me the
name udev decided to use for it in /dev.
And I'm not sure how to know if something is cdrom-ish and SG_IO able
from sysfs.  Should I filter on driver name?  But then, I don't know
which names are acceptable (*cdrom* ?)...
Or maybe I should go through the fad-of-the-day, hal/dbus?
  OG.
