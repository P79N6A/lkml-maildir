I agree with the generalities... I am looking for something far more 
specific, though.
My point in the second half of my proposal message was trying to drive 
home the point that IBM doesn't appear to know, at this time, what the 
diagnostic messages the 8139too net driver should output.  Or the 
aic7xxxx scsi driver.  Or the piix ATA driver.
And until IBM knows those things, I cannot see how any proposal can be 
put forward.  _what data_ should be logged?  "useful data" is not an 
answer.  "eeprom checksum failure, with failed checksum value" is an 
answer.  If IBM does not know these things, it is putting forward a 
solution when the problem has not clearly been examined or even defined.
I want all my net drivers to log useful data.  I also want world peace. 
  The devil is in the details.
