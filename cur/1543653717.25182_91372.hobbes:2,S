read/write on directory? OK, if you can make behavior of "control"
file more consistent.

Actually I was thinking in opposite way: requiring user to create
"control", instead of creating it automatically.
And more I think about it, why there is one "control" for each
directory? Is not one "control" for whole modfs sufficient?
fs is then just mounted with existing control, and unmount
gets rid of it.
And after implementing releasing of .init as truncate() on
module file, you can remove directories from modfs completely,
even more simplifying it.

Ok, I'll try something else. If you'll create module through
sys_create_module, and remove using echo/rm/rmdir, will not it leak
dentry?

Your current implementation will return -ENOENT because of moddir->module 
will be NULL: but it is not critical error, it just means that 
sys_create_module() was called, but sys_init_module() was not, and 
you should not fail cleanup for such case.
I think that you should not be too clever in insmod/rmmod. Just code
them like userspace clients will do: open "control", write "exit module"
and "unmap module" into it, and then unlink "module" and remove
that directory...
And do we need separate map/init and exit/unmap? I do not think that
it should be supported to do map/init/exit/init/exit/unmap...
And because of you do not allow unlink() on mapped module,
what about doing implicit exit/unmap on unlink, removing exit/unmap
operations from control completely?
