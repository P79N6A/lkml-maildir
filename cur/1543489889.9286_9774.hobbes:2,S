I know. Anyway, first: load is always 0.0x, and the number of
connections is small. Second, even if I hadn't known that and/or that
was what happend, I don't think the machine is supposed to be down
afterwards?!
Anyway, happened again, but this time I have much more data (had a
test script running). See below.
Note: I've had a script running:
E="NO";
 
while true; do
        sleep 120;
        ping -c 1 [2nd router/hop] >&/dev/null || E="YES"
        .... (log system status, ifconfig, ps aux, netstat -an, route
-n,
              lots of /proc-stuff, etc.)
        exit
fi
done
(Output of that script not included due to size, ~90k)
That script send lots of stuff (for my debugging) to a file,
which was created at 22.12, which means the network went away (i.e.
ping to
the second router outwards failed) between 22.10 and 22.12.
The number of open connections (netstat -an) was a little more than 200,
same with rt_cache entries (from /proc). There was lots of free memory,
load was 0.0x (low).
I know the static routes need to be fixed for the redirects to go
away, but I'm only a guest on that machine (told the owner, though).
(syslog loglevel for messages was *.*)
