Yes, 2.6.8.1 with this patch works for me on a JS20.  There is a pause
of maybe 20 seconds when the interface is brough up (while hardware
autoneg times out?) and then the network comes up (and serial-over-lan
recovers).
Unfortunately this patch doesn't apply to the latest bk (3.9) tg3 driver.
Thanks,
  Roland
