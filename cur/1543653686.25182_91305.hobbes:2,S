What sort of 'complete information about each disk' are you thinking
of?
Hot-spares already work.
Auto-detecting a new drive that has just been physically plugged in
and adding it to a raid array is as issue that requires configuration
well beyond the scope of the superblock I believe.  
But if you could be more concrete, I might be convinced.

Well... it depends on whether you want a 'name' or an 'address' in the
superblock.
A 'name' is something you can use to recognise the device when you see
it, an 'address' is some way to go and find the device if you don't
have it.
Each superblock already has the 'name' of every other device
implicitly, as a devices 'name' is the set_uuid plus a device number.
I think storing addresses in the superblock is a bad idea as they are
in-general not stable, and if you did try to store some sort of
stable address, you would need to allocate quite a lot of space which
I don't think is justified.
Just storing a name is enough for auto-assembly providing you can
enumerate all devices.  I think at this stage we have to assume that
userspace can enumerate all devices and so can find the device for
each name.  i.e. find all devices with the correct set_uuid.
Does that make sense?
Thankyou for your feedback.
