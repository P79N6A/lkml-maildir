What topology and what use case?

Topology is dependent on the number of CPUs.
Hot plugging is a completely orthogonal problem. Even your original
proposal wouldn't address it. Mine doesn't neither, because i suspect
most programs won't care. If it's addressed it could work
on top of it. The aux vector to get the information quickly at 
program startup and later updates can get it from /sys.
If some program starts caring we would need to implement some notification
mechanism (that would be possible), but it might be hard to fit
into glibc because you don't have a event loop.
