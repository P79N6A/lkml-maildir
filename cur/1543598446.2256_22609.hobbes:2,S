(sorry if this is a dupe, I haven't seen it come from the list, so I'm
resending as plain ASCII in case majordomo kills messages with strange
stuff)
Hi,
I need to do something similar to tail -f.
I was hoping that select() or poll() would block my process after reaching
EOF but (as the man says) EOF doesn't cause read() to block so select() and
poll() both say I can read. The result is (obviously) that my program waits
actively and uses all the CPU.
What's the right way of doing this? I assume the kernel provides facilities
to find out if there is new data to read (other than EOF).
Thanks.
