Thanks for testing.
IIRC SMP kernel without PREEMPT should also fail (or not?),
it could be that we are hitting some generic PREEMPT bug.
Cc:ed linux-kernel@ in hope that some PREEMPT guru lends us a hand.

Yes, this is expected behavior (especially when you mix SMP in)
unless of course ide_spin_wait_hwgroupt() fails (timeouts).

ide_do_request() and hwgroup->busy flag but as this could produce *a*lot*
of output (serial or net console would be required to capture the log for
the lockup case).

No problem, happy hacking. :)
