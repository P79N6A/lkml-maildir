<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>What is the status of software raid development in 
2.2.x?</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>There seems to be a growing number of hacks 
addressing kernel raid support, tools, and&nbsp;such specifics as read 
balancing, yet the kernel contains very old code for raid support which seems to 
act as nothing more than a placeholder for patching. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Would anybody happen to have a current list of 
working patches for a decent implementation of software raid1 using the 2.2.18 
kernel that employs some level of read performance that exceeds that of 1 
harddisk?</FONT></DIV>
