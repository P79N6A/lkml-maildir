This is bad, very bad. If the bill passes as written, all software will 
be subject to it. Senator Hollings and his cronies (and anyone who 
thinks like them) need to get a clue. They need to be out of office.
(My apologies in advance if this does not come across as text. My 
regular system is broken and I'm forced to use Winsucks and Nutscrape 
for my mail.)
