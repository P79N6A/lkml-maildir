Hello,
It appears that the VIA Rhine chipset has some sort of bug which shows
up in both the standard Linux VIA-Rhine driver and the Rhinefet driver
that VIA itself provides.
The difference is that the connection is dropped in case of the standard
Linux driver for VIA Rhine but that the connection remains OK with the
Rhinefet driver provided by VIA
(
http://www.viaarena.com/downloads/Source/rhinefet.tgz
 and other places
on viaarena.com...).
So VIA Rhinefet driver consumes more CPU but is also more stable.
I wrote about this issue before: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/7/82
 &
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/15/47
 etc.
I opened a bugzilla case: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5030
Who could find out why the standard Linux driver chokes and the Rhinefet
driver doesn't? Who could fix this bug?
Kind regards,
Udo
