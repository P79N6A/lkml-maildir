I find this interesting in light of the review of the developer preview
of Mac OS X at 
http://macosrumors.com/7-99.html
 which suggests that even
Apple is moving away from forks or streams at the filesystem level:
"Although by nature the native file system of Mac OS X -- UFS, the UNIX
File System -- does not support resources, Apple has developed a
relatively simple workaround for this by including a directory with the
same
name as the application but ending in three periods (...), which contains
two files: .FInfo (Finder information) and .Rsrc (Resources). Currently,
the
"UFS Converter" utility included with DP1 allows this process to be
completed automatically. By the time Developer Preview 2 is release,
Apple hopes to have automated this process at the system level, allowing
users to move Carbon applications between HFS and UFS disks without
worry. Because this resource "wrapper" directory is invisible from the
Finder and can only be seen from the UNIX command line (which itself will
only be used by power users who choose the optional install), it is
believed that this will be a satisfactory solution to the problem."
