The process of safely making delicate changes here is beyond my 
responsibility as just a user - believe me, I'm not suggesting that a 
risky fix be put in .24.   I can patch my own kernels, and I can even 
share an unofficial patch with others for now, or suggest that Fedora 
and Ubuntu add it to their downstream.
May I make a small suggestion, though.   If the decision is a DMI-keyed 
switch from out-80 to udelay(2)  gets put in, perhaps there should also 
be a way for people to test their own configuration for the underlying 
problem made available as a script.   Though it is a "hack", all you 
need to freeze a problem system is to run a loop doing about 1000 "cat 
/dev/nvram > /dev/null"  commands.  If that leads to a freeze, one might 
ask to have the motherboard added to the DMI-key list.
