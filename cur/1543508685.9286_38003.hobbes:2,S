No, that is not the same.  mmap()ing only kicks in when large blocks are
allocated.   I worked with Doug on implementing this feature.

If you were to do what you propose you would need to allocate one page for
every allocated chunk.  In fact most requests to malloc() are just a few bytes
large, say 64 bytes, while a page is 4k.  The likelyhood that all chunks in
the same page are all freed is very small.
I believe the malloc() package is doing exactly the right thing by using
mmap() for large requests while packing smaller requests in a pool that it
administers.  Whether it obtains that pool from the kernel through sbrk() or
mmap() makes no real difference on Linux, Solaris and a couple of other modern
unices, but remember that the package is also supposed to work on other
platforms on which that does make a difference.

This is incorrect.  You can easily mmap() a total of about 2.75 GB on
linux/x86.    BTW on Solaris/SPARC you get 3.75GB in a 32 bit environment.  On 
the verge of the 64-bit era you're going to need all you can get.
