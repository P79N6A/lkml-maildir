Having console switching in interrupt context was horrible... I would
much rather have the 'odd' slightly delayed console switch than drop
stuff or have sound jitter every time I switch console (which sucks
badly).
Under even fairly heavy load here it's not a problem, what problems
does the new bahaviour create (sorry, a fork bomb is a silly
example).  With a load-average of over 20 its still responsive.
