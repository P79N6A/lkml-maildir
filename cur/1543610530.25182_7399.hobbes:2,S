Where do you get that idea from.  I have created files up to 4TB (sparse
ones, of course) without problems.  After that you start hitting bugs in
the VFS and ext2 _code_, but you should be able to have up to 16TB files
on a 4kB block ext2 fs.
Please stop spreading misinformation.  Maybe there is a 2GB limitation
in libc, or your tools, or in 2.2 ext2 _implementation_ (which is
fixed if you apply the LFS patch for ext2), but no such limit in the
design of ext2 itself.
Cheers, Andreas
