Sure, but other packets might still get allocated from the
reserve and trigger this.

At this point we don't know whether the packet is destined for
a SOCK_VMIO socket or not. The only thing we know is that is
was allocated from the reserve, but it could be anything.
There is really nothing you can do at this point.

Unfortunately this is not possible either. I don't really see why
queueing is special though, dropping the packets in the ruleset
will break things just as well, as will routing them to a blackhole.
I guess the user just needs to be smart enough not to do this.
