This actually a very bk specific problem, because the real problem under 
bk there can be only one src/SCCS/s.foo.c. A separate repository doesn't 
have this problem, because it has control over the naming in the 
repository and the original naming is restored with an explicit checkout.
In this context it will be really interesting to see how Larry wants to 
implement "lines of development" (aka branches which don't suck) and 
also maintain SCCS compatibility.
bye, Roman
