Thanks, I wasn't aware that he's working on it.
I haven't started coding, I'm still collecting what's needed.
* force certain alignments. e.g. ARM needs 1024 byte aligned objects for 
the page tables.
* NUMA support.
* Add a "priority" to kmem_cache_shrink, to avoid that every 
dcache/icache shrink causes an IPI to all cpus.
* If possible: replace the division in kmem_cache_free_one with the 
multiplication by the reciprocal. (I have a patch, but it's too ugly for 
inclusion). Important for uniprocessor versions.
* add reservation support - e.g. there must be a minimum amount of bio 
structures available, otherwise the kernel could oom-deadlock. They must 
be available, not hidden in the per-cpu caches of the other cpus.
