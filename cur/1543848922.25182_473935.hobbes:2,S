Hi
this disables the save-widgets, as long as you haven't changed anything
yet when you are in the qt/gtk -GUI after
	"make xconfig" or "make gconfig".
There were no objections on kbuild-devel,
 though no comments neither on "Take 3".
Should apply from 2.6.19-rc1 onwards.

Hi
the patchset sent following up tries to implement
functionality for *config's UIs
	to know a .config's change state.
	to accordingly
		set GUI's save-widgets sensitivity,
		remind the user to save changes.
Changes in Take 3:
	Use git-format-patch instead of cg-mkpatch.
	No code changes.
Comments welcome.
      Karsten
