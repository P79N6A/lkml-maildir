I've looked at this some more and, from the various things on the web,
it seems SEGA introduced some sort of crude checksum security feature
which ctrl_outl(0x1fffff, GDROM_RESET_REG) appears to start. Unless it
is used then the GD Rom remains disabled.
After that, the hardware executes a checksum of the ROM to ensure that
you are actually booting from a Dreamcast.
Well, that is my interpretation of
http://www.ludd.ltu.se/~jlo/dc/bootROM.c
 and similar. Certainly any
other sort of read seems to keep the gdrom disabled.
