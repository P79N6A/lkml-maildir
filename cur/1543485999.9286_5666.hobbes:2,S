If you are rebuilding glibc with the same version numbers, try this:
 - build glibc with make
 - instead of make install, do
   # make install install_root=/some/other/place
 - archive /some/other/place
 - boot from an emergency repair disk
 - unarchive /some/other/place (backing up the original files of course)
Cheers
