Use cp -al to replicate your kernel source tree before configuring. It
creates a tree with hard links, so you don't waste disk space.
Just don't forget to unlink() the files, if you edit them manually. (*)
garloff@garloff:~/Physics/numerix $ type unlink
unlink is a function
unlink () 
{ 
    for name in $*;
    do
	test -f $name && { 
	    mv $name $name~$PPID;
	    cp -pd $name~$PPID $name;
	    rm $name~$PPID
	};
    done
}
								
(*) If you use emacs, you don't need to unlink before edit. The backup file
    will stay linked, but the edited is unique. patch does unlink, so
    patching is no problem. vi does NOT unlink.
