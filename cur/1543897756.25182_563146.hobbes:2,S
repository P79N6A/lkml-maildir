Subject: Re: [PATCH 007 of 8] knfsd: nfsd4: vary maximum delegation limit based on RAM size
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/27/384

This code would benefit from a little more explanation.
Also, I screwed up the previous patch and forgot to delete a line, so the
calculation here is off; fix it.

Yup, sorry about that.  Could you apply this?
