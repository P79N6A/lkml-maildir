There seems to be a bug in the scanner driver, a number of people have
reported this :(
This driver isn't needed at all, just use xsane which uses libusb/usbfs
to talk to the scanner.  That way no more oopses :)
Also, try sending this to the scanner driver maintainer, he's usually
quite responsive about these kinds of issues.
thanks,
