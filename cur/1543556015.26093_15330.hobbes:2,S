Ok, how about setting limits on login? When this looks like:
--- uid = 0 here
setrlimit(RLIMIT_NPROC, n)
fork()		<- this will fail if root has >n processes
setuid(user)
and it is hard to change this sequence, all PAM enabled apps depend on it :(
The other scenario may be when root has already n processes,
call them system stuff, and cannot login or even kill anything
because of limits.
Is this patch better? I put CAP_SYS_RESOURCE, but maybe it should be
CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
