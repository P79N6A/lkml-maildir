But the way Pavel has it coded, only tasks in the init namespace can
view /proc/.net/* for any other net namespaces.
If you object to that (I'm undecided - though on a gut level I do prefer
a simpler approach using bind mounts and not forcing any cross-ns access
control this way) then the ids become relevant, but the way Pavel has
it, it's just not.

Well a task in one pid namespace cannot view the /proc for another pid
namespace, right?

Yes, but they won't just 'change out' from under you, you ask for it...
But here like I said I do prefer an approach where /proc/net is bind
mounted by the user.  But I have no good reason to back it up...

Which pid will be used?  This .netns directory still is systemwide so
these pids  must (a) be globally unique and (b) be available (by your
requirements :)  upon a container restart so that the restarted process
can re-use the same pid...
I don't see the advantage to using a pid.

Yuck, I far prefer to have userspace mount --bind /proc/.net/whatever
to /proc/net rather than have the readdir and lookup do magic filtering.

When you say pid are you talking about a pid_nr or a struct pid?  In any
case, I still don't see what makes it available for reuse on a
restart...
And if not available for reuse on a restart, then we may as well use a
simple global unique id as Pavel uses.

But I don't see how this is going to work.  If you're using a pid_nr
inside a pid namespace, then you're not guaranteeing that the pid_nr
will be unique, so you may not be able to create th e/proc/.netns/X
directory.  If you're using the global pid, then you're not guaranteeing
that it will be available upon a container restart.
