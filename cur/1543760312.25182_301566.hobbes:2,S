Hmm ok, nothing of interest there. What does the mount error 6 and 2
from  your original mail mean? I need some more info on what fails
specifically. What mount options are used? What partition is mounted (is
it md or hdaX)?
I'm not sure -bk5 had the follow up fix patch for the barrier rework,
you should probably just retry with -bk6 first.
