It seems because ACPI takes itself too important and sets the default to y 
and this selects PM and prevents it from setting to n, until ACPI is 
reset. default and select is a really bad combination. :-(

This is actually documented. :)
n - 0, m - 1, y - 2

Symbols can be hidden by new dependencies.

Yes, some symbols are hidden behind a lot of dependencies, if a user wants 
to enable a new option, he only adds one new option and kconfig can try to 
figure out the missing options.
