Here's what I see on x86 and gcc 3.2 (for Linux 2.6.1).
What Linux version of the code are you looking at?
$0x180,%esp: c01fd5aa <aes_encrypt+4/1750>
$0x1b0,%esp: c01fecfa <aes_decrypt+4/17da>
$0x230,%esp: c0206acd <test_deflate+b/2f8>
$0x10c,%esp: c0205c90 <test_hmac+6/4fc>
$0x1fc,%esp: c01e9ed8 <sha1_transform+4/178a>
$0x120,%esp: c01eb842 <sha256_transform+6/1ef0>
$0x384,%esp: c01ed988 <sha512_transform+4/17e8>
$0x10c,%esp: c01f1c90 <twofish_setkey+4/7480>
