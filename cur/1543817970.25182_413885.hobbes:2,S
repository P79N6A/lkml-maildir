Its a char device driver Im using to control the SPI port on the PXA255 
processor. I transfer fixed sized packets over this bus, and hence DMA 
is a good option instead of interrupt driven IO.
it seems that the dma_pool_create function explicitly handles both cases 
dev = NULL and dev != NULL.
However, the dma_alloc_coherent function only checks if dev is not NULL, 
and apparently uses the valu in one case without checking it.
My understanding is that the dev pointer is needed only to check the 
mask for accesible DMA locations correct?
