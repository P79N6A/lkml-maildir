Sounds like a network driver problem.
Are you still getting the "hordes" of Tx timeouts with the
3c905B which you reported a week ago?
If so, do they only start coming out when the slowdown occurs?
You are probably a victim of the APIC bug.  A
workaround for this is present in 2.4.2-ac5.  Alternatively,
boot the kernel with the `noapic' LILO option.
Please let us know the outcome.
