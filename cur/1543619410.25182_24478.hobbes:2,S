This is due to some userspace application calling
ioctl(BLKFLSBUF);  The kernel calls invalidate_buffers()
against a live device so it can of course sometimes
encounter a locked buffer, and it spits this message.

No, there's no risk.  I think the invalidate_buffers()
call should only be made within the ioctl if the device's
usage count is one, but various kernel luminaries didn't
like the idea, for reasons which I failed to understand :)
