Hello all,
[ Posted on both linux-net and linux-kernel ]
Using kernel-2.2.16-3 (Redhat) on P3/650 (UP).
I just got a D-Link DFE-570TX Quad Ethernet card.  It seems to use
DC21143 chipset.  
Has anyone managed to get this card working in forced full duplex/100
Mb?  More of the problems encountered below.
Initial tests show that it works OK with tulip in autonegotiation mode.
With de4x5 drivers in auto-negotiation mode, there is one irritating
problem.  If you have configured your interface up, and then plug out the
UTP cable, you'll get the following errors ad infinitum:
---
eth2: media is unconnected, link down or incompatible connection.
eth2: media is 100Mb/s.
eth2: media is unconnected, link down or incompatible connection.
eth2: media is 100Mb/s.
eth2: media is unconnected, link down or incompatible connection.
eth2: media is 100Mb/s.
---
Repeated at about one second's intervals.  Apparently the driver always
tries to take up the interface no matter what.  I have also tried to
take up all interfaces save one to see if it'd homehow fail because
_other_ ports are down, but that didn't help any.  This won't happen with
my other one-port DE500-BA using the same drivers.
This isn't a show-stopper though.
Both de4x5 (either from 2.2.16-3 or the one from 2.2.17pre12) and tulip
fail to work properly in forced full duplex, 100Mb environment.
With de4x5, you'll just get an error:
eth2: media is unconnected, link down or incompatible connection full
duplex.
Even ARP resolution won't work.  New 2.2.17pre12 worked like a charm on my
other, one-port DE500-BA though.
With tulip, you get no warnings but it just won't work.  I tried both
options=5,5,5,5 and options=14,14,14,14 arguments.
Tulip drivers on Donald Becker's site seemed significantly different, but
I wasn't able to test with them;  all I got was:
---
tulip.o: unresolved symbol pci_drv_unregister
tulip.o: unresolved symbol pci_drv_register
---
I'm no driver/kernel guy, but perhaps some might have ideas what might be
going on here.  I can naturally test anything you can throw at my
direction ;)
