That wasn't the request.

What I wanted was the patches organized into functional groups that
were small enough to review as a unit.  (Feed the existing patches slower
please).
This seems to be to much change to read and review as a unit, I just get
bleary eyed, and start to get confused.
So far I have found one subtle bug.  Where admittedly my code wasn't as
obvious as it could be and you were proposing to use an irq that had already
been freed.
What I had hoped we can do is you would send a handful at a time I
would review them.  Then we could get the next handful.  I expect
doing it that way it should take about a week to get through them all.
I guess I can try going through the review that way as well.  Pick a
subset of what you have sent and review it very carefully, and the
next day pick a different subset.  
I have been sufficiently active in this code lately that I think I can
do a good review, and I want to.  Unfortunately I'm only human and
a good review is nearly as much work as writing the patches myself
which means it takes time.
