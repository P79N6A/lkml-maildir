No more usb for me with this patch :P
When usb is loaded I get this in dmesg:
irq 9: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
  [<c01302d3>] __report_bad_irq+0x2b/0x69
  [<c01304bd>] note_interrupt+0x1ac/0x1e3

handlers:
[<c024616a>] (acpi_irq+0x0/0x14)
Disabling IRQ #9
and while USB has the same irq in /proc/interrupts now as earlier, usb 
doesn't work (or sometimes it does, just dog slow!). Acpi is of course 
disabled, so no acpi events neither.
I have to admit, that this computer have some weird behaviour - see 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2874
 - but still, it's been 
working well for many years now, before this patch. While I do 
understand that I seem to be the only one affected by this bug, I hope 
someone will help me look into another way to solve my problems if this 
patch get applied.
Thanks.
