Well it is not "worse".  Futzing with i_sem in do_no_page() is pretty gross.
You could add vm_ops->prevalidate() or something if it worries you.
btw, it should be synchronising with
file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping->host->i_sem, not
file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_sem.  do_truncate() also seems to be taking the
(potentially) wrong semaphore.
