Here's my problem - I have an ESS Solo1 PCI card that I got working fairly
well with Linux 2.2.12, and now I'm trying to get an analog joystick
working with it. When the solo1 module starts up, it says the joystick
port is at 0x1075.  When I try to load the joystick/joy-analog module,
specifying the port 0x1075, and even when i don't specify an IO port, it
says there is no joystick, after reading joystick.txt in the kernel docs
dir. I have tried this with two different standard analog joysticks that I
know are working properly.
