You probably just need to rebuild the lxdialog stuff -- from your source
directory (/usr/src/linux normally), cd scripts/lxdialog ; make clean all.
Then it should work.  If it still doesn't, make sure that your glibc-devel
package got upgraded properly (as I know of a machine on which it didn't,
though I think that was a disk space issue)
