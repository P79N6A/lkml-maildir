the use of initrd is a real pain in the butt. with multibooting GRUB 
loads the modules into memory and the kernel can take them from there. 
In this way the main kernel can be smaller, you won't need built-in 
filesystem drivers  (they will be preloaded by GRUB), you will not have 
to recompile the entire kernel all the time, but only the modules.
The MAIN THING  that a multiboot kernel will solve is the problem of 
module portability. I think that the reason why hardware producers are 
not making drivers for linux is that they have to make them open source 
in order to be compiled by every user. With multibooting it become 
possible to make a standard type of the main image of the kernel and all 
the modules will be built for it. So, the hardware vendors won't have to 
make public their sources and they will be encouraged to write drivers.
AND besides all that you can do many operations before mounting the 
actual root like, for example, make a module that encapsulates a nice 
boot animation, a progress bar, show the services start in a nice 
graphical way on top of the framebuffer.Of course this can be done with 
the current kernel, but you have to rebuild the entire kernel each time, 
errors will appear all the time.
