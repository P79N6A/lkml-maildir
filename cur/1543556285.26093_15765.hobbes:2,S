I was unsure if it was okay to be using kmalloc during early stages of
init/main.c so I decided to follow the example allready set and just use a
static array - can anyone advise on being able to do this dynamically?

Yeah you would need to patch lilo as well to handle the new syntax amongst
other things.  I use grub and have no troubles along these lines.
Refrencing the idea in the follow on message about just using the last
root= only and not allowing multiple root= would work around this.  I
guess I can't think of any really good reason why having multiple root= is
a necissary feature.
