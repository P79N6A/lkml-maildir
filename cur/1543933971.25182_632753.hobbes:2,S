On the other hand, the patch you just posted that makes io_delay=none the 
default _is_ blindly disabling. So that wasn't for consumption?
io_delay=udelay additionally blindly disables the race-hiding effect the 
outb has on SMP and that Alan is seeing so many of. Should also wait for 
more driver review.
