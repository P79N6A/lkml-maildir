No argument, you need to change the interface to take advantage of RDMA.

Yes, on the transmit side, there's not much difference from sendfile
or splice, although RDMA may give a slightly nicer interface that also
gives basically the equivalent of AIO.

I don't understand how this gives you the same thing as direct data
placement (DDP).  There are many situations where the sender knows
where the data has to go and if there's some way to pass that to the
receiver, so that info can be used in the receive path to put the data
in the right place, the receiver can save a copy.  This is
fundamentally the same "offload" that an FC HBA does -- the SCSI
midlayer queues up commands like "read block A and put the data at
address X" and "read block B and put the data at address Y" and the
HBA matches tags on incoming data to put the blocks at the right
addresses, even if block B is received before block A.
RFC 4297 has some discussion of the various approaches, and while you
might not agree with their conclusions, it is interesting reading.

It seems that the NIC would also have to look into a TCP stream (and
handle out of order segments etc) to find message boundaries for this
to be equivalent to what an RDMA NIC does.
