Yes. If you tell the kernel "walk from root down", it should do. I think we talked at cross
purposes. You told me strcmp(dirname(),$cwd)==0 and I understood strcmp(dirname(),".")==0;
behaviour should be quite similar, shouldn't it? (But the former comes from outside a "chmod
000"-barrier, the latter from inside in our cases.) As I already said, I feel
% ls /tmp/abcd/xyz/foo
/bin/ls: /tmp/abcd/xyz: Permission denied
% ls foo
foo
to be a contradiction, but this is subjective. :o)
So: the kernel does not do your magic (comparing dirname() with $cwd), but it does my magic
(using the old resolved rights for "." rather than the current one.)

I only advocate this if after your "chmod 700 /tmp/abcd" is a "chacl -R user bob +rwx /tmp",
but this should be legal, I think.

Without "-R", there shouldn't be any dynamic inheritance.

Because I do not like to wait (and probably many other people, too). And because people tend
to use directories to group similar things together. Often, similar things should have similar
access rights. If a user thinks "these files should be rw-accessible by joe and sue, and
r-accessible by bob, and not accessible by anybody else", the filesystem should implement it
that way. Likewise an ISP could implement those rules: "all files below /data/webexport should
be readable by httpd, and all files below that directory should be writeable by their
respective owners, and no one else should be able to access those files". Now imagine the ISP
wants to give a web-site maintainer (bob) rw-rights to everything below "/data/webexport".
"chacl -R user bob +rw /data/webexport" is all which needs to be done, and it is executed
immediately. The primary reason is: speed and "object-orientedness". You see your directory
(including everything below it) as an object, and this object should have certain properties.
Also, a certain flavour of ACLs could make it possible to have a dir "/dir1" accessible by
everyone and "/dir/file" accessible by "everyone the parent (/dir) grants and sue, too". If
you downgrade the access to /dir to "students only", the access to "/dir/file" still can be
"everyone the parent (/dir) grants and sue, too". With non-dynamic, always effective ACLs, you
could not apply logical operations to the rights of the parent, further fine-graining the
access control as needed. With alwayss effective ACLs, further fine-graining should be fairly
difficult, because you could not decide wether an ACE is due to the parent (or any other
imported ACL object) or wether it is due to the process of fine-graining.
Maybe it is like the difference of a database-table and a spreadsheet-table. If you change the
database-data in a cell, nothing else changes. But if you change some spreadsheet-data, many
values in many cells may differ. You could, of course, change many database-cells at once, but
it's not the same as changing one spreadsheet-cell and seeing how other cells change too
(because they depend directly or indirectly) on that cell.

I can agree with space efficient, but I have doubts with "fast". As there is no hard disk you
cannot make full, there would be no "chacl -R" operation which you could not make need too
much time.
