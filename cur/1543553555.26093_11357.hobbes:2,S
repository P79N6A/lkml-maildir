Thanks, Alan.  You're right, and this is indeed how the current
implementation behaves.  The DG/UX manpage makes a bit more sense
here.
One interesting factoid: if a process currently has an exclusive
lock, and it changes that to an exclusive lock (ie: no change),
this has the effect of dropping the lock and reclaiming it.
The DG/UX dg_flock() departs from BSD in that "Upgrading a lock 
will be an atomic operation.  That is, a lock is not released
to upgrade that lock".  Linux doesn't do that - the lock is
effectively dropped and reclaimed when we go from LOCK_SH to LOCK_EX.
Even the DG/UX manpage doesn't say what happens when you sidegrade
the lock.  LOCK_EX->LOCK_EX :)
