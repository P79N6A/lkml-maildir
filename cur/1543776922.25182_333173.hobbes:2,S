Hi all.
I can't seem to get a new PS/2 mouse to give any input on 2.6.11.6. I 
have tried creating /dev/input/{mouse0,mouse1} apart from 
/dev/input/mice as per numbers in Documentation/devices.txt, and cat 
<device> gives no output when wiggling the mouse.
I have tried compiling psmouse as module and loading it, and I have 
tried compiling it into kernel. I have also chosen to have a /dev/psaux, 
that doesn't get any input either. Mouse seems to get detected, as per 
this snippet from dmesg:
...
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
...
input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
...
Best regards,
Sune Mølgaard
