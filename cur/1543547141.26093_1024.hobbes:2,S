Huh? The version number is right there. For example:
/boot/System.map-2.3.99-pre3
Doing a "make install" should put System.map in the right place.
Unless you have scripts to update them at boot, I suggest that you
delete /System.map, /boot/System.map, and any other unversioned
copies you might have floating around.
You don't get the build number or a unique ID.
This is a flaw but see below...

Nope. The "release" is exactly what gets used in /boot.
There is no advantage here.
Modules might not exist, and System.map has nothing to do
with modules anyway. System.map is derived from the kernel.
