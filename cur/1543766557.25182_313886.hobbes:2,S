So if I understand this correctly, you'd like to manually turn off devices
during a power off.  I believe the ACPI spec recommends this for S4 (but also
to leave on wake devices), but not necessarily S5.  Still it may be a good
idea.  Comments?

Yeah, that's what I had in mind when I mentioned PMSG_FREEZE.  It seems
to replace "shutdown" in many ways, is this correct?
