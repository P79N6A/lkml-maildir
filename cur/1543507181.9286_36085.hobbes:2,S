bumped back to me :-( )
Hello!
    Hope this is not a mere hardware problem: it shouldn't, because I
fschecked the disk successfully some day ago.
    The disk is a JTS PALLADIUM of 850 MB, and I have it since 1996. It is
master of the second IDE channel, together with a cdrom drive set to slave
(the hd jumper is correctly set "master with slave", too). My kernel is
2.2.11, but I tried even 2.0.36 with the same results. Sometimes, especially
during long disk operations, the following lines do appear:
hdc: status error: status = 0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: drive not ready for command
(or instead of "status error:" gives me "unexpected_intr" or something like
that)
Sometimes this gives me errors, sometimes everything goes on as if nothing
had happened. These messages seem to come out randomly, and when I reboot
and retry everything is ok (it may happen somewhere else, of course).
I tried to boot LILO with "hdc=slow", but the errors were still there.
Don't know what to do (apart from throwing away the hd :-( ).
  Thanks for your support.
        Mardy
