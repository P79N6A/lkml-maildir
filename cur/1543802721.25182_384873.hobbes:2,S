It is not possible to use non blocking IO with O_DIRECT, because the 
kernel does not buffer the data, and once the write() call returns, the 
kernel can not touch the caller's buffer any more.  The idea of O_DIRECT 
is that the hardware can directly DMA from the caller's buffer, so if 
you want to keep the hardware busy, you need to use async IO so the 
hardware always has some work to do. 
I actually hacked up dd to use async IO ( via io_submit ) in conjunction 
with O_DIRECT and it did noticeably improve ( ~10% ish ) both throughput 
and cpu utilization.  I have an OO.o spreadsheet showing the results of 
some simple benchmarking with various parameters I did at home, which I 
will post later this evening. 
Of course, dd is a simplistic case of sequential IO.  If you have 
something like a big database that needs to concurrently handle dozens 
or hundreds of random IO requests at once, O_DIRECT async IO is 
definitely going to be a clear winner.
