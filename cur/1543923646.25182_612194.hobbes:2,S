The key idea for collapsing profiling, markup and tracing was that
marking up the code is required for both profiling and tracing. It's
only the code that is called from that markup site that differs.

It becomes interesting when they can share code and/or a common control
architecture. The fact that markup could be shared between profiling and
tracing could be a good incentive to do so.

Ok, so maybe we should keep "markup", "tracing" and "profiling"
separately and see how things evolve.

With SMP systems becoming cheap commodity hardware, each and every
developer increasingly face thorny race problems, both in user-space
apps and in the kernel, which may involve hypervisor-kernel-userspace
interaction. Sadly, the blame is often put on kernel developers because
tools like gdb, oprofile and strace are practically useless to solve
such problems and people lack the right tool for the job.
Therefore, marking up the code to perform tracing should not be
considered esoteric: it's a very useful tool when one needs to
understand what is happening in their large scale system. Userspace
doesn't always have the ability to isolate problems and, worse, some
problems a just unreproduceable when tried to be isolated. I think it is
sensible to give them a tool that helps them understanding what is going
on.

Should it come with a re-duplication of it's content into each
architecture, which was the case previously ? The oprofile and kprobes menu
entries were litteraly cut and pasted from one architecture to another.
Should we put its content in init/Kconfig then ?
