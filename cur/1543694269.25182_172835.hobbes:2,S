doh, indeed.
i'm happy with the timer->base write ordering fix that addresses the first
race, it fixes the bug that was actually triggered in RL. The other two
races are present too but were present in previous incarnations of the
timer code too. I'll think about them - both rely on racing with timer
expiry itself - which is more likely to trigger these days because the
tick is now 1 msec, and kernel virtualization is more common too, which
can introduce almost arbitrary 'CPU delays' at any point in the kernel.
