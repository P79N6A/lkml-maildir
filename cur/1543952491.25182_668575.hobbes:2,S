No, my bad, you're right (GPL-only existed, but they were covered already).  
The problem with this is that we'll get a bogus unused warning in the case of 
doing a __find_symbol on an unused symbol.
It's time for a general cleanup of the __find_symbol logic.  I'll post when 
it's done.
Thanks!
Rusty.
