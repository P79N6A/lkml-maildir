Generates a timer interrupt when a certain counter value has been reached.
This is a common feature of most clock chips that I am aware of.

It backs out of the fast call track and does a regular call instead.

This is just some toying around with the concept. Maybe tick could be
called by the regular timer interrupt?

I agree this is vague and I have no clue here. I hoped that you
could come up with some may to use these functions for adjtimex etc? I
would need some time to figure out how the adjusting works in order to
come up with a solution. I thought we agreed you do the NTP and time
adjustment things ;-) I have never touched that code....

Will have a look at it and put it together when I have some time.
