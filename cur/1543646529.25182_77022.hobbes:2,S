Here is what the interrupts look like:

Upon starting a user-space TCP connection to myself (no traffic running on eth2-3,
eth1 is not plugged in to a cable.  eth0 is handling a small amount of traffic,
no more than about 25 packets per second on average):

Please let me know what other debugging info I can get you.
