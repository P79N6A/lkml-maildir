I stand by my claim that any obstacle to obtaining and modifying any copy of
the source code (and thus encumbering your ability to use it at all) would
be a violation of both the letter and the spirit of the GPL. (As expressed
in section 3.)
Until someplace you can't actually access the software is customarily used
for software interchange, ...
But I fear that your interpretation of section 7 is mostly correct. This is
a defect in the GPL. At least as I understood it, the intent was to force
distributors to remove any code for which there was a patent claim that
might threaten redistribution. Section 7 fails to do that.
While you are granted rights under copyright, section 7 does not prevent
people from using other laws (so long as they don't impose the restrictions
or agree to them) to hamer your right to redistribute (or for those who
receive a distribution from you to lawfully use the work).
It is quite difficult to actually arrange this. You would need something
like a third party to indemnify your customers without your having to agree
to such indemnification.
