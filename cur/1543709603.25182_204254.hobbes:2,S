Sounds like bad memory.  It's quite impossible for a bad memory module
to show up a problem in one kernel but not in another, simply because
kernels are storing their active data in slightly different memory
locations from one release to another (or even from one compiler, or one
set of config options, to another.)
I'd definitely be running memtest86 as the next step here.
Cheers,
 Stephen
