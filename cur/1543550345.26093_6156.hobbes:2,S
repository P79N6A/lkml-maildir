We are talking binaries here, but anyway, what you say is easy to do:
nobody *forces* you to apply their patches or forces you to even use their
sourcecode. Go and fetch the official apcahe, it will just run fine.

is, while maybe worthwhile on a "bash all distributions"-list (or even
here ;) is not the actual point, which is binary incompatibility because
of forked versions for no benefits.
