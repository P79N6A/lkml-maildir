Hi,
I have a NForce2 board and can easily reproduce a lockup with grep on an IDE 
hard disk at UDMA 100.  The lockup occurs when both Local APIC + IO-APIC are 
enabled.  It was suggested to me to use NMI watchdog to catch it.  However, the 
NMI watchdog doesn't seem to work.
When I set the kernel parameter "nmi_watchdog=1" I get this message in 
/var/log/syslog:
Dec  4 20:10:30 tesore kernel: ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to 
IO-APIC
Dec  4 20:10:30 tesore kernel: timer doesn't work through the IO-APIC - 
disabling NMI Watchdog!
"nmi_watchdog=2" seems to work at first, In /var/log/messages:
Dec  4 20:13:11 tesore kernel: testing NMI watchdog ... OK.
but it still locks up.
I have the complete logs when running with nmi_watchdog, kernel config, and more
here:

If you have any ideas please give them =)
