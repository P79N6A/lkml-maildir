Subject: [PATCHES] 3 of them, resubmit, over 2.4.1-ac20
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/2/21/53

All are as attachments, I've submitted them separately over 2.4.1-ac16, these
are remade over -ac20.
Descriptions:
* ac20-redundant-cpp-directive.patch: in
  arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:irq_affinity_write_proc, there was a redundant #if
  CONFIG_SMP .. #endif directive. This patch removes it.
* ac20-lockdoor-ioctl.patch: in drivers/ide/ide-floppy.c:idefloppy_ioctl,
  this patch adds the CDROM_LOCKDOOR ioctl. Based on drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c for
  policy about said ioctl for drive usage stuff.
* ac20-spurious-assignment.patch: in mm/vmalloc.c:vmalloc_area_pages, ret is
  set twice to -ENOMEM whereas once would be enough. What's more, the loop in
  which this spurious assignment appears runs with the kernel lock held. This
  patch fixes this.
Have fun,
