Hello!

Please remember that the driver is not the sole user of the PCI config
space -- user-space programs (e.g., lspci) can access it via sysfs, too.
Should we force users of such programs to add a magic kernel parameter
to enable MMCONFIG? Does not make much sense.
Maybe we should do all bus scanning with conf1 and then try if MMCONFIG
returns the same values?
				Have a nice fortnight
