Question. Why is this modules not loaded but the kernel when needed. I
haven't built the bttv stuff yet, I have been warned not to buy anything
for any computer until Dec 26 (personal) or Jan 1 (business), so my bttv
card is not even ordered yet, but I do expect to get one, and I would
expect this to be handled by the loader and depmod.
Or was this a suggestion in case his kernel didn't have auto loading?
