No, no, you're agreeing with me ;-)

The vm doesn't know what a transaction is.  But, the vm might know that
a) this block is pinned by the FS for write ordering reasons
b) the cost of writing this block is X
c) calling page->somefunc will trigger writes on those blocks.
The cost could be in order of magnitude, the idea would be to give the FS
the chance to say 'one a scale of 1 to 10, writing this block will hurt
this much'.  Some blocks might have negative costs, meaning they don't
depend on anything and help free others.
The same system can be used for transactions and delayed allocation,
without telling the VM about any specifics.

I see the VM calling page->somefunc to flush that page, triggering whatever
events the FS feels are necessary.  We might want some way to differentiate
between periodic writes and memory pressure, so the FS has the option of
doing fancier things during write throttling.

Pretty much.  I don't think the VM should say 'you have too many pages', I
think it should say 'free this page'.

Well, my only point is that it is possible to make an interface for write
clustering that gives the FS the freedom to do what it needs, but still
keep the intelligence about which pages need freeing first in the VM.
