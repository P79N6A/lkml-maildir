OK, that was only my first guess, because you have to recompile i4l utils
with 2.2.13, if not you run in trouble.

Yes, this message is not hide (but has only debug prio), because it
should be not happen in normal cases (I looked trough the log of my syncppp
machines and didn't found it).
It seems here is a problem with some places which allocate skb with not
enought headroom (old version was crashing in this case).
Now we reallocate the needed headroom and print this message to find out
the real reason.

You can disable prio DEBUG in syslog.conf.
