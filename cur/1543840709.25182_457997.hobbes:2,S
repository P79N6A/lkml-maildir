First badblocks, then Manufacturer's (Maxtor) overnight burn in tests.

I tried to be more careful before posting here :). I even ran a second
test on the drives on a second machine.

No, but I think there is a driver issue such as VMW or the reiserfs.
Reiser even mentions this error on his faq suggesting it's a bad ide
cable. Of course, I changed mine (now testing #4). Of course, switching to
NO preempt has reduced the volume of errors greatly. Even last night
there were none for the time being.
