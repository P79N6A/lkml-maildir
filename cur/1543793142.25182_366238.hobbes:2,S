OK - I'm confused. What is the difference between an Athlon 64 and a 939 
pin Opteron? Or the difference between a 939 pin dual core Athlon and a 
939 pin dual core opteron?
I understand that the 940 pin Opterons can be used on multiple processor 
boards. But I just don't get it about using a single opteron.
Also - while I'm asking - AMD Semprtons now are 64 bit - so what's the 
difference between a 64 bit Sempton and a 64 Bit athlon?
