 We at the kernel level cannot make such rash assumptions.  Although
undesirable, it is not an error if a legitimate user process needs 100%
of physical ram.  This is not uncommon in low-memory systems, university
lab-projects, large databases, and highly parallel kernel builds etc.
 Yes, its a serious problem if a userspace program can bring down the
machine, but the correct behavior would be to deny requests for
resources beyond those available- no more...  apparently this is easier
said than done at the moment.

 Yes, we've done something like this.  CS students have an affinity for
fork bombs- but you need to look for an excessive number of processes
for a single user, not his memory usage....  This is special case with a
potentially expensive solution.
