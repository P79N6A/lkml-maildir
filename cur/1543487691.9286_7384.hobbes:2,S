Probably yes but look at this part of the trace:
55.573090 gwyn > riesz.: FP 258421:259687(1266) ack 1 win 32120 (DF) [tos 0x8]
Linux sent the last packet full of data with FIN set for the first time.
But if I remeber the TCP right (note: I could be wrong, but I really don't
have the time to check the specs now :( ), the sequence number of the data
should be 259686 and the sequence number 259687 is the one for taking care
of the FIN.

And here Solaris is acking also the FIN. Maybe I am wrong.

Agreed.

I agree. I tried to expose the thing as more clear as possible in my first
email just to avoid all possible mistakes. I quote myself again:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
[..]
Solaris has a stupid bug in its TCP stack that cause it to hang the
connection between linux-2.2.x and Solaris (with linux as server) once the
connection closes.
[..]
Sun just released a fix for Solaris but since I think there are still many
buggy Solaris 2.6 and 2.5.1 TCP stacks on the Internet, I taken the time
to implement a workaround for Linux.
[..]
Just to avoid confusion I repeat: this is a silly Solaris bug and not a
Linux bug.
[..]

I think my form is the cleaner and the shorter (zero crap) and
exactly/only for this reason I think it could be applyed to the official
kernel. I really don't think it worth to waste more time for a workaround
of a silly Solaris bug adding more code to _smart_workaround_ it (note
also that my sysctl has zero performance inpact), and I don't like that
linux TCP stack will retransmit different packets when we guess that the
other end could have been confused by us. So I take the way to avoid
confusion in first place and I still like it.
