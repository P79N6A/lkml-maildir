  I have a Maxtor D541X (20Gbytes, 5400rpm), and its results are about 
37MB/sec... Motherboard is Epox 8KTA3 with VIA 686B southbridge (HDD runs in 
UDMA5 mode).

  Did you enable UltraDMA2 (P2B-S supports only UDMA2, not UDMA4 nor UDMA5)? 
32-bit transfer? What 'hdparm /dev/hda' and 'hdpram -i /dev/hda' says?
