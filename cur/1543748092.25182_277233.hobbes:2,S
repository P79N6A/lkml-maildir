It looks way better than last time :-).

Ugh, we probably should always stop tasks and always free memory. To
get code paths tested etc.

This should not be conditional.

You mkdev, than test that MKDEV worked? Could you add a comment why
its needed?
I'd write it as "if (sscanf ... !=2) return -EINVAL". If (MKDEV is
broken) return -EINVAL, but Andrew would hate me then.

So... if userspace echos "0:0" into resume file, you attempt to do the
resume, and oops the kernel? Why not doing name_to_dev_t,
unconditionally, while doing resume_setup? And probably kill
CONFIG_PM_STD_PARTITION; I do not like idea of kernel automagically
trying to resume without anything on command line anyway.
