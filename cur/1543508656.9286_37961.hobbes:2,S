I too am interested in the recommended patches.
I am having lockup problems with 2.2.12 (floppy, 
possibly sound, NFS).  These machines appear
to lockup with no kernel magic key operation,etc.  They
are dead and I have to reboot....  
The problems I am seeing are on multiple different machines:
1.  Dell WS400, dual PII/300, aha2940, sb16, crystal 4232, 3c59x
2.  Penguin dual PIII, aha2940, sb128(es1370), eepro100
The Dell usually locks up when accessing the floppy (with
or without the floppy=nodma option).  On this machine, I 
build 2.2.12 with the kernel debugger (0.5) and have not
had it lockup yet (typical -- add the debugger and it 
won't crash).  This machine was stable with RedHat 5.2
and 2.0.3x kernels (but sound never worked well).
Any help would be appreaciated.
