Bernd> Hello,

On unpatched 2.4, the limit (depending on your driver) for a single
block device is either 2TB-1k or 1TB - 512b.
The 2.4 kernel keeps the block device sizes in an unsigned int, in 1k
units, so the maximum size is (2^32-1)*1k.
I forget which subsystem does it,but one of them tries to keep the
capacity of a disc in an unsigned int in 512byte units; if you're using
that subsystem, the macimum size you can use is (2^31-1)*512b
