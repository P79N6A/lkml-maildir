Hm. This would mean that probe() would be the decision "I want to use
this device", while probe_async() would be "setup my device, may take
some time"? Could work.

But probe would return int, while probe_async would return void? Two
liner :)

Looks like an idea.
I'll sleep on it, just too tired to make sense.
