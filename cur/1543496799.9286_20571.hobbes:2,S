I am nearly one hundred percent positive that this started with 2.2.8 or
2.2.9.  I run 2.2.9.  It may be due to the cd-ripping and mp3
encoding/playing I have been doing (tired of dragging my cd collection
everywhere with me).  Anyway... here is what happens:
pop-click, very loud.  It happens every so often.  I recognize the two
sounds and have verified that they are the drive going to sleep and then
instantly spinning back up.  Has any change caused this, or is my
software now just being crazy?
If it is the latter, I still want to know so I can just tell my hard
drive never to power down.
