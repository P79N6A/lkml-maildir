That's one type of starvation, but that's one that can be easily
prevented by the os. Not a problem.
The starvation I'm talking about is the drive starving requests. Just
keep it moderately busy (10-30 outstanding tags), and a read can take a
long time to complete. The hba can try to prevent this from happening by
issuing ever Xth request as on ordered tag, however the fact that we
even need to consider doing this suggests to me that something is
broken. That a drive can starve a single request for that long is _bad_.
Issuing every 1024th request as ordered helps absolutely zip for good
interactive behaviour. It might help on a single request basis, but good
latency feel typically requires more than that.
We _can_ try and prevent this type of starvation. If we encounter a
read, don't queue any more writes to the drive before it completes.
That's some simple logic that will probably help a lot. This is the type
of thing the deadline io scheduler tries to do. This is working around
broken drive firmware in my oppinion, the drive shouldn't be starving
requests like that.
However, it's stupid to try and work around a problem if we can simply
prevent the problem in the first place. What is the problem? It's lots
of tags causing the drive to starve requests. Do we need lots of tags?
In my experience 4 tags is more than plenty for a typical drive, there's
simply _no_ benefit from going beyond that. It doesn't buy you extra
throughput, it doesn't buy you better io scheduling (au contraire). All
it gets you is lots of extra latency. So why would I want lots of tags
on a typical scsi drive? I don't.

This doesn't make much sense to me. Why would the CPU speed and
available memory impact this at all? We don't want to deplete system
resources (the case Justin mentioned), of course, but beyond that I
don't think it makes much sense.

Yes, if the hba and its drive _and_ the target can _efficiently_ handle
it, I'm all for it. Again you seem to be comparing the typical scsi hard
drive to more esoteric devices. I'll note again that I'm not talking
about such devices.

If device quirks are that 90% (pulling this number out of my ass) of
scsi drives use pure internal sptf scheduling and thus heavily starve
requests, then why bother? Queue full contains no latency information.

This is not a problem with the vm flooding a spindle. We want it to be
flooded, the more we can shove into the io scheduler to work with, the
better chance it has of doing a good job.

Agrh. Who's saying 'fix' the hba driver? Either I'm not expressing
myself very clearly, or you are simply not reading what I write.
