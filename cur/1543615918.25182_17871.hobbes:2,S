actually I meant more "don't care about filesystems that are broken
anwways" :) but since we're changing the semantincs ourself below in the
mainstream we'll have to check for the other internal usages of
buffer_new, should be very easy though.

this is 2) and it looks fine, but we need to update write_full_page too
to clear the bit (that's pagecache). Anybody else checking for
buffer_new on visible pagecache bhs should be updated as well.
And also generic_direct_IO needs somehow to write something if get_block
fails during a write. But I guess there it is simpler to let brw_kiovec
to go ahead before the get_block failure, otherwise we've nothing to
write (patching the iobuf->length for the duration of the brw_kiovec
should be enough, so we do a short write and we notify about the error
only if we couldn't write anything, of course it would be better to
restore the length later even if probably not needed). This will also
allow to use all the blocks of the fs and it's what the userspace expects.
For the o_direct writes in my tree the ->truncate is just in place
(truncate_inode_pages isn't needed there).
