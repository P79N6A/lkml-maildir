Can you give me some sort of idea as to what keys I might use for indexing?
For instance, AFS has the following:
	PRIMARY KEY	SIZE		AUXILLIARY DATA IN INDEX
	==============	==============	============================
	cell name	up to 64 ASCII	- volume location database
					  server addresses
	volume ID	32-bit number	- name of volume
					- associated keys
					- fileserver addresses
	vnode ID	32-bit number	- access time
					- vnode metadata record pointer
					  - vnode ID version
					  - vnode data version
					  - modify time
					  - size
					  - data block pointers
Each index entry of course has a pointer back up the hierarchy.
Furthermore, to determine whether a cached file's contents are still valid, I
can compare the the vnode ID version and vnode data version numbers against
the server.
Not all these indices and keys will necessarily be useful for NFS.
