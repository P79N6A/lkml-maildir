Well, I have an implementation that is showing very promising results. I
plan to polish the code a bit and post the code somewhere this week.

Actually, CLOCK-pro does not have an active list. Pure CLOCK-pro has but
one clock. It is possible to create approximations that have more
lists/clocks, and in those the meaning of active list are indeed
somewhat different, but I agree with nikita here, this is odd.

nod.
