The first one is true, and since they all mean the same thing, they all
are :)
At least, that's the case in 2.0.x.  2.1 (and soon 2.2) have improved
matters a fair bit as some of the "easier"  targets - VM, signal-handling,
process handling - have finer grained locks around them.
However the filesystem and network stuff is still pretty single-threaded,
although this will change in time, too.
The funny thing is it's not such an issue with Linux because it has such
low latencies that it still scales better than NT on 4 way boxes.

  FUD that's true :)
