Ah. So you'd much rather prefer that code in drivers/ make assumptions:
sizeof(long) == sizeof(long long), and, sizeof(long) == sizeof(sector_t),

I don't enjoy getting "this is a subscriber-only list" notifications,
thank you.

Change as in increase in size, right? Did you even read the mail? The only
argument you had given against the cast to (unsigned long long) was what
has been underlined above, which was bogus, considering we would have to
change the "%lu" specifier in the printk() also, when that happens
(otherwise suffer silent truncation).
But looks like you /are/ deciding "nobody except PS3 platform would ever
build this driver anyway" ... so okay, the current code, will all it's
non-portable assumptions, is okay.
