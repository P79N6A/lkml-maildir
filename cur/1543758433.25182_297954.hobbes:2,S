Yep but it was a lot more "fun" when there were three PIO codepaths. ;-)
hdio.txt doesn't need to know about driver internals so no problem here.

I was thinking about:
* adding ATA_TFLAG_{IN,OUT}_xxx flags (there is enough free
  place for all flags in ->flags field of struct ata_taskfile)
* teaching flagged_taskfile() about these flags and mapping ->tf_out_flags
  onto ATA_TFLAG_OUT_xxx (simple mapping no need to move ->tf_out_flags
  to ide_taskfile_ioctl() etc. - no risk of breaking something)
* moving flagged taskfile writing to ide_tf_load_discrete() helper
* adding ide_tf_read_discrete() helper for use by ide_end_drive_cmd()
  and mapping ->tf_in_flags onto ATA_TFLAG_IN_xxx (ditto)
If you like this plan feel free to implement it.
I'm also open for better ideas, comments etc.
