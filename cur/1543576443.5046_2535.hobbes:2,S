Yes, looks good to me, and passes some tests. Here is a patch that has not
been cut and pasted:

I have one additional question: invalidate_buffers normally gets called if
someone wants to make sure that, after the call, read accesses to a device
really go to the device and don't get served by a cache. Is there some
mechanismn that does the same thing to mapped pages?
