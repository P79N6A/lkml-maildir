Hi,
attached is a new version of neofb for Linux 2.4 that
supports all PCI based NeoMagic chipsets. It has been
ported from the XFree Driver. Features include console
acceleration and LCD panel size detection. Basic features
like mode switching, virtual resolutions, mtrr and mmio
are also implemented.
I've seen this driver working on many notebooks now and
would like the driver to be included into the kernel
distribution.
Thanks.
