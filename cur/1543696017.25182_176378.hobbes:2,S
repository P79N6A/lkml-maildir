Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Marcelo, All,
	In working to resolve an issue in SLES8 SP3, Andrea caught a bug in the
cyclone counter's lost-tick compensation code. In the code, we use the
calibrated loops_per_jiffies to detect the number of ticks that have
passed, however the lost-ticks code begins running before
loops_per_jiffies is calculated. This circular dependency that can cause
loops_per_jiffies to be occasionally mis-calculated.
The fix drops use of loops_per_jiffies and uses code from 2.5 to do the
same thing. This patch only affects x440/x445 machines.
Many thanks for Andrea for catching this. 
Any comments and feedback on the patch is welcome. 
thanks
