The VFS requires all directories to have full paths from the
filesystem root in the dcache.  This is needed for loop detection when
renaming directories.
suppose and NFS client: (UPPERCASE words refer to file handles)
 Says "lookup ROOT 'a'" and gets A  (file handle for /a)
 Says "lookup A 'b'" and gets B     (file handle for /a/b)
 waits for /a and /a/b to be flushed from the dcache
 Says "RENAME ROOT 'a' to B 'z'"    (i.e. asks for /a to be moved to /a/b/c)
how can the VFS detect that that is not allowed?  It needs to know
that B is a subdirectory of /a.  The complete path cannot fit in
filehandle, so to needs to be computed by repeated lookup of "..",
which must be on disk.
Even without that, storing ".." on disk makes lots of sense for
fsck-like tools.
