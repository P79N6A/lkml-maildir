Hmm. That patch does
+	error->log = (struct ipw_event *)((u8 *)error->elem +
 					  (sizeof(*error->elem) * elem_len));
which really can be much more cleanly written as
	error->log = (void *)(error->elem + elem_len);
since pointer addition does the "multiply by pointer element size" on it's 
own.
For future reference, you want to make just a byte add, the cleanest way 
(in kernel, where we use the gcc "void *" additions) is
	newptr = offset + (void *)oldptr;
ho humm..
