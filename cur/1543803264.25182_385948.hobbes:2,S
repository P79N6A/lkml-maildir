Actually, I've written a hackish script that tries to do simple-minded
bisection (read: it searched for the 50% point on the shortest path
between any-of-GOOD and any-of-BAD, instead of considering the whole
graph) on BK trees. I haven't exactly published the thing anyplace though,
because, well, it was ugly. :-/
Besides, actually working with the current bisection point is no problem
at all for git. Doing the same thing in BK's world view is *painful*,
esp. given the size of the kernel tree.

Arthur felt at a bit of a loss. There was a whole Galaxy
of stuff out there for him, and he wondered if it was
churlish of him to complain to himself that it lacked just
two things: the world he was born on and the woman he loved.
