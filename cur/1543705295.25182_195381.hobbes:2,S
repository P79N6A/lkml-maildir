An uninitialized BAR could have the same effect and it is easier to
trigger.  ia64 boxes get so little volume you can miss things.  I
killed an ia64 box once by changing the serial console baud rate.
I have no problem with firmware it is just that since it must be
written on a per board basis, and firmware is hard to update you
simply can't assume it is correct.  Some little bug may have gotten
through the QA checks.  Hardware has similar pressures except it
is even harder to correct.
So the concern is just healthy programmer paranoia.  If it can
go wrong it will.

pfn is short for page frame number.  It is the abbreviation that is used
by the kernel vm layer for a page number.  And it is a term that at
least to be used quite a lot in texts explaining virtual memory and
paging.  
If you have a map_resource I don't know why you would need ioremap64.
But I have no problems with wrappers.  The question mostly is which
function is architecture specific and which can be generic.
If I was not in the middle of moving out of my current apartment
hunting I think I would whip up a patch.

Thanks for the updated patch.

Ok it is nice to see the support getting there.
The table entry should be just as relevant on ia64.  It is odd
though that on ia64 the firmware interface is updated and on x86 a
firmware bypass interface is added.
