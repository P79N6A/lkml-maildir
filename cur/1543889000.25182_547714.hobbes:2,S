Hello Jeff,
thank you for this effort.

So what is the reason to do this now, does this block some changes in
other places ? I did not change this code for long time because I know
that this is a nightmare, the code was grown and grown (supporting more and
more cards/chipsets) and is really nothing which should be used in future.
So I would say it maybe better, if it doesn't block anything else, to
replace HiSax completely with a new modular design. I know that here was not
so much effort in the past years, but now I got some time to push mISDN
forward and it looks not so bad to get the first parts ready for mainline
in June.
Neverless, if you still think that we should get rid of the old HiSax
code, I'll help as much as I can, I still have most of the cards available
in my lab, so I can also test all changes.
