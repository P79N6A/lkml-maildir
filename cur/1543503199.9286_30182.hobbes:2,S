Can you give me a pointer to that meachansim, and also how it's
handled in other Unix like operating systems ?

Their arppoach is very specific to their implementation of OpenGL. It
does not address AGP and other issues relevant to current graphics
boards (from the documentation I have seen). What we are trying to
make available is a relatively simple AGP driver that addresses the
limited area of AGP mapping and management without trying to cover
all the issues that are involved to do direct rendering.
