BTW, Linux' implementations of transports like USB storage and SBP-2 
have always been similarly layered. (Actually they come with at least 
one more layer between LLDD and SCSI core.) Needless to say that these 
transports need their specific managing infrastructures. So this 
layering is not at all new to Linux.
