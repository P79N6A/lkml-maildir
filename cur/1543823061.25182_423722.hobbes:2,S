I'm not saying hey won't map on bus states ever... I'm saying they
sometimes will or not, it's not a 1:1 relationchip, thus they are not
_directly_ related. This is why there is the whole issue of describing
the power state dependency that I talked about later in my mail.

Because "PCI_D2" Means nothing from a device function point of view
imho. "Clock stopped" would make much more sense (provided it's what the
device does when in D2 mode, there is a definitive lack of consistency
three as D states have never been properly defined except for D3 cold :)

Which is mostly bogus, and probably due to driver writers not even
bothering looking at what the device is actually doing when put into a
given Dx state... I suppose a lot of dumb devices also only really
handle D0 and some kind of Dx (where X can be 1...3 and that are about
equivalent).
> The PCI state semantics are well enough defined
No they are not. Historically, they were pretty much undefined.
Recently, Intel/PCISIG updated the PCI PM specification (that I suspect
pretty much no device vendor read) that provides _some_ clues as to what
states might actually mean, mostly that their semantic is essentially
specific to a given class (which is as good as being undefined as far as
the generic code is concerned). The only "sure" thing is that D0 is full
on and D3 is the max power management... In addition, there is this
optional mecanism for a device to report it's power consumption in the
various states, but that's pretty much it.
The only thing that has (finally) been properly defined are the bus
states (B0...B3).
Thus I still think that the PCI D state is an implementation detail to
be known by the driver only and doesn't have anything to do with a user
interface.

No, I want some reasonably defined semantics.

And handling the dependencies...
