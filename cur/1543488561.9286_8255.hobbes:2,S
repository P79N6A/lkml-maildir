Sure, and everyone thought that was brain damaged too. It made for some
very complicated user space code, and I dread to think how complex many
286 UNIX variants became. Moving to a flat address space was the "thing
to do" when writing 386 DOS applications.
Just for contrast, it is possible to get a 1Mb ram pack for the C64, an
8-bit machine with technically only 64kb address space. It was achieved
using bank switching, and it was a stupid idea then too. It was simpler
to just get a 16-bit machine, and often faster/cheaper as well.
