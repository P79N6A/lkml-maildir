So we agree that 2.3.51 fbcon/fbmem patches will be backed out?

For multihead you have one more mapping. Currently you have only
con2fb. For multihead you'll also have per-keyboard ALT-Fx -> global
system VT number mapping. So that on keyboard #2 ALT-F1 selects
VT274 and not VT1... Except VT-up/VT-down (ALT-LARROW/ALT-RARROW) you
can do it even now through keyboard mappings, if you make them per-keyboard
(and you should; at least per keyboard, per-VT is better).
It is all about policy. I'm root and I want to take over my coworker
console because of he forgot to drink cofee and is now typing only
bugs instead of code... Why kernel should prevent me from doing that?

Moving VT feature from fbdev is not same as removing 'if (con == currcon)'
from fbdev source, silently expecting that con == currcon. You have
to ensure that fbcon will not call fbdev with con != currcon...

If it happens for good reason, then why not. I do not know whether 
current in-kernel vfb.c does same thing as your vfb.c, but size of output 
from preprocessor says, that your code is bigger...

And why saving/restoring state should copy data?

Then it is change of userspace semantic... And it should be discussed also
with application programmers.

You can remove this code from fbdev then. Look at every function in
every fbdev. It each start with 
if (con == currcon) {
    /* do real work */
} else {
    /* do some work more or less copied from another driver
       and if someone fixed/changed it in one driver, other
       are left intouch... */
}

I do not see which currently available ioctl allows me to get/set
underlying fbdev informations.

Well.
