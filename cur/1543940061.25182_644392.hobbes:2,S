Ok, I can see how my overly terse statement could be interpreted
in this way, and I apologize for that.
However, it _is_ a fact that there is a proliferation of specialized
mailing lists, and it is also a fact that many developers _only_ read
those lists. I'm in no way defending this behaviour, on the contrary
I probably dislike it as much as you do. But we can't ignore it.
I should of course have written something like "please cc: <whateverlist>"
instead of the stupid "wrong mailing" list comment.

Gladly.
