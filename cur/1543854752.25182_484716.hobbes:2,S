Ah, OK, so there's about 2.5-3.5ns difference due to the instructions
you removed.  That's very much in line with that I saw in my measurements.

2 syscalls/iteration?  It's interesting you measured about the same
absolute time difference (.42s) even though you're doing 1/5th the
number of syscalls.

Hm, but "time" measures user, system and real time.  You used real time?

Well, there might be a miss simply because the line got evicted.  But as
Andi pointed out, a hot benchmark like this is very unlikely to get any
cache misses unless there's something very unfortunate happening.
