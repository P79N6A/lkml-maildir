current bttv tries to find a PCI device for the given physical address by
walking all PCI devices, then check whenever the address falls into one of the
dev->resource memory ranges.  Works fine on i386, but I'm not sure whenever
this works on other platforms, where phys == bus isn't true.
Right now it only sanity-checks the given physical address this way (see
below), but of course I could also pass the found pci_dev to some pci->pci
API.
What addresses are in dev->resource?  Physical?  Bus address?  Are they
unique?
