Ben,
aio_read/aio_write() are now working with a minor fix to fs/aio.c
io_submit_one():
	if (likely(EIOCBQUEUED == ret))
		needs to be changed to
	if (likely(-EIOCBQUEUED == ret))
		  ^^^
I was wondering what happens to following case (I think this
happend in my test program).
Lets say, I did an sys_io_submit() and my test program did exit().
When the IO complete happend, it tried to do following and got
an OOPS in aio_complete().
	if (ctx == &ctx->mm->default_kioctx) { 
I think "mm" is freed up, when process exited. Do you think this is
possible ?  How do we handle this ?
