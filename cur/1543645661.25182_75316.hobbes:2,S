Just in case SF goes down, (yeah, I know, not likely, but you never know), I've put the following on-line:
http://www.jbradford.dial.pipex.com/patch-2.5.40.bz2
http://www.jbradford.dial.pipex.com/patch-2.5.40.gz
so, there is no excuse not to test the 2.5.40 kernel ;-), who cares if it hoses your IDE drive or not, (not that it will, (probably)).
John.
