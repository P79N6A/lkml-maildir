Hi,
One of my servers running 2.4.1 was attacked earlier today.  I have a strong
feeling it went down because the kernel was logging too many messages to
syslog.  There's over 100,000 lines of the following in my syslog:
Feb 23 12:28:25 omega kernel: UDP: bad checksum. From 202.96.140.146:20567
to 21
6.115.239.40:113 ulen 1472
Feb 23 12:28:25 omega kernel: UDP: bad checksum. From 209.249.213.145:36338

Feb 23 12:28:25 omega kernel: UDP: bad checksum. From 211.54.39.161:14958 to

216
.115.239.40:113 ulen 1472
How do I suppress these types of messages from hogging up all the CPU?
Thanks,
Vibol Hou
