I'm not certain which way you're directing me now: a conservative
attitude suggests we play safe at the end of st_read, by saying we might
somehow have dirtied memory there, perhaps if someone changes sequence.
As I presently, incompletely have it, to maintain more similarity with
sg.c, I've actually moved away from "dirtied" to "rw" READ or WRITE,
and it will look odd to put WRITE at the end of st_read.
I'm giving up for the evening, and probably won't have a chance to do
more until Sunday - the PageCompound issue still under discussion too.
