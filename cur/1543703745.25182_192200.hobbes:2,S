Subject: Awful NFS performance with attached test program

Hello All,
    The attached program demonstrates a problem I am having writing to
files on an NFS file system.  It works by creating a file, and then
seeking through the file to update it.  The problem I am seeing is that
the seek/update stage takes more than 10X as long as the amount of time
required to initially create the file.  And its not even seeking in
some strange pattern.
    I am running this with a 2.4.20 (red hat patched) kernel.  I have not
tried it with 2.6.  I have played with various mount options, but they
do not seem to make much difference.  Here is one example that I used:
sledge:/l0 /mnt/v3_tcp_8k nfs rw,v3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,intr,tcp,lock,addr=sledge 0 0
Anyone have any ideas or comments?
Thanks,
Jim
