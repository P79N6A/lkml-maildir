Looking back at the patched together set of man pages, old printouts, stale 
books, tricks picked up from other people's code, and occasional groveling 
through the kernel and library sources I've used over the years to figure out 
how to program Linux:
Is there a book out there that actually says how we're SUPPOSED to be doing 
all this stuff?  Which APIs are actually recommended for use under 2.6 and 
later?  (Does O'reilley publish an up to date version of the POSIX API, with 
examples?)
