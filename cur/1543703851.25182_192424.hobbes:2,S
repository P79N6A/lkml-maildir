Ok.  Makes a locking flaw less likely as those tend to trigger with
preemp or smp only.

That pretty much looks like it is really a hardware issue.

That isn't a fresh booted box, is it?  Please reboot the machine after
every oops and before continuing testing.  With known-corrupted memory
it can oops basically everythere and those oops reports don't help
much.

That was xawtv I guess?  Now transcode starting?

Oh, doesn't print the riscmem addresses.  The blocks are two-page
sized through, so the one-page allocation slab complains about above
likely doesn't come from this.

strange value for a kernel address, probably some corrupted pointer.

in edx.  "objdump -Sd video-buf.o" should help finding the instruction
and corrospending source line, but I fear that wouldn't help much as
that isn't the source of the problem but the place where it shows up.

cleanups due to transcode being killed ...

... and here it hits the very same corrupted pointer again.
