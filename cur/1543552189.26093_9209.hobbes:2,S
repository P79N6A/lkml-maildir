It seems you've misunderstood the code (I agree it isn't as straightforward
as I would wish, but the whole PCI probing business is a bit fishy anyway).
The current probing code doesn't ignore the BIOS check results at all --
the check_pcibios() function looks which direct access methods are said by
the BIOS to be supported by the hardware and if there are any, we continue
with probing these direct access methods. Only if they fail or the BIOS reports
no known direct access methods, we fall back to using the BIOS functions.
(There is a couple of good reasons for trying to avoid using BIOS to access
the configuration registers -- these functions are slow and sometimes buggy.)
I still think the code is correct and only the documentation needs to be
updated (I'll send a patch to Linus as soon as I catch up with my mail queue).

Unfortunately, it doesn't :(
Anyway, have you already tried "pci=conf1" as I've suggested in my previous mail?
				Have a nice fortnight
