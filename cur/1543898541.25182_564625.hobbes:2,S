Your'e right: seems that fedora kernel is based in 2.6.21-git5 and
latest changes in ppdev and parport layer starts at 2.6.21-git10. 
So need to look at other changes...
What does mean this report received in my working kernel?
"ppdev0: negotiated back to compatibility mode because user-space
forgot"
