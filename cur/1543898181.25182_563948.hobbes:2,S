If that's the policy, why do we leave this up to individual drivers? 
Right now most of them let you make the query regardless of interface 
state.
I'd agree that there's a need for a state where we power down as much as 
possible (even at the cost of functionality), but where possible it 
would also be nice to offer a state where the mac is powered down and 
the phy left up. If the existing semantics are confused then it would be 
nice to fix them, too.
