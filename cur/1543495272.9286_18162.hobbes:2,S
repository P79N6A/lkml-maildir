I have been pounding on Andre's "golf" patch on a machine with a Promise
Ultra66 controller, and an IBM Ultra66 drive.
So far my stress testing has only triggered a lockup bug in my network
card driver (which caused much pain and gnashing of teeth until I setup
serial-console on my headless server).
Andre's IDE golf patch has been rock solid throughout the testing without
any peeps.  Not like my opinion has any sway :) but I would like it if the
changes were rolled into the official kernel, or maybe the "ac" patches
for wider testing.
I've ordered some more Promise Ultra66 controllers and Ultra66 drives for
other machines.  The performance is quite impressive.
