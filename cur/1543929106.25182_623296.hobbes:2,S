Do you not test your drive for minimum functionality before using them? 
Also, if you have the tools to check for relocated sectors before and 
after doing this, that's a good idea as well. S.M.A.R.T is your friend. 
And when writing /dev/zero to a drive, if it craps out you have less 
emotional attachment to the data.
