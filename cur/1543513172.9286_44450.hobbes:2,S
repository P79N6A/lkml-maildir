IMHO  it's doable but kludgey and requires sever side executables.

http 1.1 supports byte ranges so I think this can be done.
I've done some prototyping work on this exact thing, the jist was this:
You can't create true fs semantics without the use of sever side execs
(cgi-bin of whatever).  Doing a read-only is much easier than a read
and write. To write you'd need to use http 1.1's PUT which I found to 
be occasionally implemented not to spec.
Amen Vidaht did exactly this in WebFS as a graduate student at UC 
Berkeley I think it was published in 98.  He's now and Duke, so 
check his home page there. 
There was something called userfs - which allowed you to 
swap in ftp or http. I never tried it.
What I'd like to see instead of http and ftp is a file-system that
uses scp & ssh as the transport.  It would be a secure method to mount
remote files on machines that you don't have root access on.
