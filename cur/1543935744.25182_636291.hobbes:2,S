Good idea. The bug is real and should be fixed IMHO.

Not just backup systems, but any application that relies on mtime

Agreed.
In fact if mtime is not reliable (which it is not) one could argue

I've only looked briefly at your patch but it seems resonable. I'll
try to do some testing with it later.
Thank you for working on this long standing bug.

I agree that our current behaviour is certainly not what the standard
(sensibly) requires.
