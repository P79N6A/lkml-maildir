  I don't neeed to send in bug reports, there are plenty on l-k
right now:
  - LVM is currently broken in 2.6.9-mm1
  - the RTC and NMI code have a race condition between them
  - NFS mount won't accept a FQDN over 50 bytes (patch was
    sent and utterly ignored, then recently reposted)
  - cdrom driver thinks non-mt. rainier drives are capable

  Are you saying people who encounter bugs in 2.6.9 should wait for
2.6.10?  ...and when they find bugs in _that_ release they should keep
waiting?  In other words, Zeno was right after all?
