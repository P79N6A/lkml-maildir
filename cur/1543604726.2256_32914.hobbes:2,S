not to slight TGKH AC, but he's also the 2.2 maintainer; perhaps there's 
some paternal protectiveness there ;)
my test for VM is to compile a kernel on my crappy old BP6 with mem=64m;
I use a dedicated partition with a fresh ext2, unpack the same source tree,
make -j2 7 times, drop 1 outlier, and average:
2.2.19: 584.462user 57.492system 385.112elapsed 166.5%CPU
2.4.12: 582.318user 40.535system 337.093elapsed 184.5%CPU
notice that elapsed is noticably faster even than the 1+17 second
benefit to user and system times.  Rik's VM seems to be slightly
slower on this test.  with 128M, there's much less diference for 
any of the versions (and I don't have the patience for <64M.)
