So we currently do b, quite strictly. Its the trailing space thats the
problem. It also shouldn't have altered the brightness value if it ends
up returning -EINVAL.
I've looked around other implementations and it would appear we should
accept an optional space. Most sysfs attributes seem to handle this
differently, each with its own "bugs".
I've some fixes in mind both for the led and backlight classes which
I'll post once I've done a little more testing. I'd be interested to
know the official view on what the attributes should/shouldn't accept
is.
Cheers,
Richard
