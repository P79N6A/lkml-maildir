There are three:
 (a) use a queue, where interrupts add to the end of the queue, but
     leave the part you're copying from unmodified.
 (b) copy to a temporary buffer with spinlocks, then copy from that temp
     buffer to user space.
 (c) don't do it. 
There are _very_ few reasons to do what you suggest, almost no driver
I've ever seen depends on anything like that. You may just have a design
that is fundamentally flawed. So (c) is not just being facetious, I'm
serious.
