My incomplete understanding of bzImage is that it skirts around the 640K
size limit imposed by BIOS's a la the DOS era.  This allows you to have
larger kernels than 640K.  At least, that's how I understand it. Means
you can compile more *into* the kernel and have less modules.  I wish I
understood the mechanics better. 
Hopefully, this isn't *too* far off base, but I read something to this
effect in one of the docs.
