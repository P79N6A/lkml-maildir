nah.
You can pick up the book "Linux Core Kernel Commentary,"
by Scott Maxwell, from CoriolisOpen Press (www.coriolis.com).
ISBN 1-57610-469-9.  (hmm, server down/offline, or not in
business?)
However, it's for kernel 2.2.5, and much has changed
since then.  Keeping up with Linux requires lots of time.
