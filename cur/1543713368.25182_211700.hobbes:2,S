I tried libata from 2.6.5-rc3. Previous versions are considered broken by the 
author, especially for error handling.
However, I had far worse problems:
Apr  3 10:18:10 urmel kernel:  <3>ata1: DMA timeout, stat 0x0
Apr  3 10:18:10 urmel kernel: ATA: abnormal status 0x58 on port 0xF8854087

This probably was a hardware problem. A new SATA cable seems to have fixed it. 
  Can't explain the 'medium error'.
SMART status of the drive is ok. No bad sectors according to SMART, none 
reallocated.
