  If they will sabotage OS that isn't their, it will be much more serious
charge in court than what they have now. And they will have hard time
explaining why they couldn't add their version of some library or utility
without removing existing ones -- it's not Windows where DLLs replacement
is the only way to do changes/upgrades just because designers were
genuinely dumb when they made DLLs support.
  And why in the world anyone will run anything written by Microsoft as
root? If some [skipped] even will make such a thing that has to be root
to install, won't it will take more than two days for someone else to
write a wrapper that makes chrooted environment where installer will
be run as some normal user, but all environment will lie to him that
he is root?
