Subject: Load linux...from linux?

While watching my system boot this morning, waiting for it to finish
scanning the various SCSI controllers, I found myself wondering if maybe
there was a way to avoid all this delay.
If loadlin can load linux from under DOS, and BootX can load linux from
under MacOS, is it possible to write something similar that runs linux?
For instance, it would be nice if the last action when rebooting a linux
system were (optionally) to load and execute a new kernel image, rather
than reset the system.
Or better yet, shutting down a linux system would return one to a boot
loader prompt from which one could select a new kernel (kind of a
poor-man's open firmware).
Has anyone worked on something like this?
