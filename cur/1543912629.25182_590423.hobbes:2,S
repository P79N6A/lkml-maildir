That's because MSR_P6_PERFCTR0 is the same as MSR_ARCH_PERFMON_PERFCTR0.
But I'd personally add that change anyway, as it makes the code less
tricky and the compiler should optimize it away.

Hm hm, does the same thing (watchdog stuck after check) happen with
older kernels, ie. those before Stephane's changeset that made it use
PERFCTR1?
Maybe you could "activate" the Dprintk in write_watchdog_counter32() to
see which value gets written to the MSR? (I don't see any switch to
activate it, so maybe just s/Dprintk(/printk(KERN_WHATEVER / ?)
Thanks,
