yeah, you are right :-) I'll fix this.
btw., "non-ancient distros" does not just mean "recent distros", it 
really means "just about any distro you picked up in the past 10 years". 
You'd have to go out on a limb to find something historic (or keep 
copying /lib/libc5 binaries to new distros like Pavel did) to still have 
this particular libc5 assumption/breakage. [ Or at least so i hope =B-)]
