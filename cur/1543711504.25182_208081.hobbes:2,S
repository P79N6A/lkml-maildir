The whole point is that it is non ram, if it would be ram, x86 couldn't
notice the virt_to_page, since the page_t would be in the range of the
mem_map_t and pfn_valid would be happy with it.
If it was dma_alloc_coherent it would return ram I think, not non-ram.

will this dma_coherent_to_page be allowed to run on a non-ram page?
It's pretty ugly to use page_t for non-ram. one can always convert with
a mul or div with sizeof(page_t) though. My point is that if you want to
allow stuff to deal with non-ram you must never have this stuff work
with page_t but it should work with pfn instead.
