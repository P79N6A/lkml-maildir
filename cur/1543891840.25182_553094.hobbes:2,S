The values can be changed after the cpuset is populated, right?  So
really these are just defaults?  Would it then make sense to just
default to (parent_set - sibling_exclusive_set) for a new sibling's
value?
An option is fine with me, but without such an option at all, cpusets
could not be applied to namespaces...
