no.  It needs tasklist_lock as well, to keep the other CPU (which is doing
wait4) at bay.
Fix a race identified by Jeremy Kerr <jeremy@redfishsoftware.com.au>: if
update_process_times() decides to deliver a signal due to process timer
expiry, it can race with __exit_sighand()'s freeing of task->sighand.
Fix that by clearing the per-process timer state in exit_notify(), while under
local_irq_disable() and under tasklist_lock.  tasklist_lock provides exclusion
wrt release_task()'s freeing of task->sighand and local_irq_disable() provides
exclusion wrt update_process_times()'s inspection of the per-process timer
state.
