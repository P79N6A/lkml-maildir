This entire patch looks nice and very straightforward, except for this
bit. :)  The "(void)" bit isn't usual kernel coding style.  You can
probably kill it.
BTW, why does get_container() return the container argument?
get_task_struct(), for instance is just a do{}while(0) loop, so it
doesn't have a return value.  Is there some magic later on in your patch
set that utilizes this?
One other really minor thing: I usually try to do is keep the !
CONFIG_FOO functions static inlines, just like the full versions.  The
advantage is that you get some compile-time type checking, even when
your CONFIG option is off.
