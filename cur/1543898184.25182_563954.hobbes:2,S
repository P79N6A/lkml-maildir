Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] uvesafb: a general description
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

uvesafb is a generic driver for VBE2+ compliant video cards; an enhanced
version of vesafb and a direct successor of vesafb-tng [1].
This is the second version of this patch, and it incorporates all fixes
and cleanups suggested on the lkml.  My thanks to everyone who took
their time to review the first version.
uvesafb uses a userspace helper application (v86d, [2]) to run the x86
Video BIOS code.  This makes it possible to include in uvesafb all the
standard features (refresh rate control, video mode changes etc) that
are missing from vesafb without resorting to ugly hacks such as the ones
used in [1].  The current implementation of v86d can use either LRMI or
x86emu to run the BIOS code and supports both x86 and x86_64.
