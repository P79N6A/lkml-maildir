With the r/o bind mount patches, we can have as many
spinlocks nested as there are CPUs on the system.
Lockdep freaks out after 8.
So, create a new lockdep class of locks for the
mnt_writer spinlocks, and initialize each of the
cpu locks to be in a different class.
It should shut up warnings like this, while still
allowing some of the lockdep goodness to remain:
