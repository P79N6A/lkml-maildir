same comment as with the last uninit'd var patch:  these markers should 
be used sparingly.  Try it on multiple compiler versions, see if it's a 
new behavior.
Quite realistically, you might actually be finding gcc bugs, implying 
the proper path is to file a gcc bug report (and they are _very_ 
diligent about handling these, its impressive) rather than to patch the 
Linux kernel.
Overall, for any uninitialized_var() patch, we need more info on 
platform/compiler version/analysis methods/etc.
