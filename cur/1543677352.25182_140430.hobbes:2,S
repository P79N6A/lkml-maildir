There is a cache in the host bridge and the PCI-PCI bridge. I dont
think we go back to memory for sub cacheline reads.
What I think is happening is that we arent tripping the prefetch logic.
We should take a latency hit for only the first cacheline at which point
the host bridge decides to start prefetching for us. If not then we take
take the latency hit on each transaction.
