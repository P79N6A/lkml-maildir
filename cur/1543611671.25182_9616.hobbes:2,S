Incremental stuff always breaks and misses out on the corner
cases. The same seems to be true for stuff coming out of
random mutation and biological selection ... natural selection
really doesn't care about corner cases.
This, for example, has always resulted in a VM subsystem which
works nicely under low load but falls apart under high load.
Any efforts to fix that corner case have been met with nothing
but resistance.
Lets face it, if you want to deal with corner cases you don't
want to deal with Linus.

Rik
