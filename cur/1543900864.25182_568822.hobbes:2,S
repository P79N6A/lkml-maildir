I think you've made a mistake putting this one into your -mm tree:
I thought we'd replaced it all by the one-liner to mspec.c
[PATCH] mspec_mmap don't set VM_LOCKED
There is no justification for a driver to set VM_LOCKED these days
(even in 2.4 they were supposed to set VM_RESERVED instead).  So
all this to handle a driver setting VM_LOCKED is inappropriate.
mspec was the only driver doing it in tree, but ATI's fglrx is the
one Dmitry spotted (and it takes care to adjust the locked_vm count,
so that won't even wrap negative later - the worst that happens is
they prevent the process using their driver from locking as much
memory as it might wish to - or that's how it looked to me).
The only debate is what we might do in the way of extra checks after
coming back from a driver's ->mmap.  WARN_ON(vma->vm_flags & VM_LOCKED)?
And which other flags?  hch is keen to put a check in there, I'm less
interested, and haven't begun to think of all the things we might wish
to check if we're going to distrust the driver here, and wherever else.
But that would be the way to go, not Dmitry's check_lock_limit patch:
please remove it from -mm after all.

All very good thoughts, but we don't even need to think them!
