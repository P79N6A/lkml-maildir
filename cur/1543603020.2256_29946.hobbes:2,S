We are used to the preservation of time stamps during a dir move
(both inside and outside its parent dir) in other working kernels such as
2.2.x and 2.4.2 and 2.4.3. After all, dir time-stamp lets us know when
directory contents have been last changed. In fact even "cp -p" allows
the user to preserve the time stamp during dir copy. With the current
implementation of mv the user will not have the option of preserving the
time-stamp during a dir move. In any case, if we want to change the time
stamp of a dir we always have the option of using touch.
