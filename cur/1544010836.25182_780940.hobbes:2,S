i do remember build and boot failures there - with weird combos of gcc 
options. It's a clear GCC bug. Anyway, we can clean this up and we'll see 
how relevant the failure modes are.

agreed mostly, with this twist: vdso inlining dependencies should be 
expressed explicitly, via:
  native_vread_tsc()
but we can also make native_read_tsc() __always_inline [it's a single 
instruction with basically no preparatory halo around that instruction] 
and document the vdso detail there.
