Same config here (reiserfs 3.6.x, aic7xxx drive), works without
problems.  Is reiserfs or aic7xxx compiled as a module in your setup? 
If so did you remember to install the new modules and mkinitrd (if
required).
Is reiserfs on your root drive?  If not can you please boot into single
user mode, enable sysrq, try the mount again and get the decoded output
from sysrq-p and sysrq-t if it hangs.
