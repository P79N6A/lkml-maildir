This is an excellent point.  If someone is holding a lock
across a uaccess function and userspace has passed the address
of a valid but not-present page we will hit the "atomic copy_user"
path.  Userspace will be returned an EFAULT and will be left
scratching its head, wondering what it did wrong.
Or the kernel will deadlock, of course.
I don't think we need to add the check to anything other than
ia32.  That will pick up the great bulk of any problems, and
arch-specific code won't be doing these copies much anyway.
So if you could prepare a patch which adds these checks for
ia32 it would be muchly appreciated.
And if you're feeling really keen, Dave Jones has a patch which
makes the might_sleep check a real config option rather than
overloading CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL - would be nice to squeeze that
out of him if poss.
Thanks.
