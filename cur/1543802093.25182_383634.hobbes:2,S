Thanks for all your help.Ethernet driver is already using NAPI.
The main problem was that the sender was running on P4 which has 3 gHz
speed and the reciever had speed 133MHz.So the sender was transmitting
packets far quicker than the reciever could handle.
Then i used the sme MIPS board as transmitter and another one as
receiver so now i recieved almost 80% of transmitted file.
