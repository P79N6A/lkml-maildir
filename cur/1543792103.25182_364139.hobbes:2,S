I would like to see a real patch instead of verbal descriptions, because
what you say is not easily believable. I suspect a language barrier.
The difficulty is, in 2.6.14, both ub and usb-storage clear halts when
the device stalls (in ub_probe and usb_stor_Bulk_max_lun). It may be
incorrect, because it's a stall on the control pipe, not a bulk pipe.
But I have no idea what the proper recovery procedure is (e.g. what
happens if we just ignore stalls of control transfers?)
If someone like Pat explaned me what to do, I could code it.
