I've seen this sort of thing a lot.
I now use the ide-scsi layer for tape drives as the scsi tape driver
seems much more reliable.
I think my problem is to do with time out issues, in that the ide driver 
doesn't givev much pause for error code, key/asc/ascq= 2/4/1.
The drive is reporting unknown command (0x1e). This isn't
documented in my copy of qic157d.
Additionally that commend is list in the 2.2.17pre3 ide command 
#defines. Hmm.
Faulty memory? etc. . Check your ide-tape.c file for
a line which says '#define IDE_TAPE_*_CMD  0x1e'
Unless there's an ioctl which meant this has been issues from userspace.
In which case it a BRU issue.

     Think of the mess on the carpet. Sensible people do all their
     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
