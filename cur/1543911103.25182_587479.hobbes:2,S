I think we just slam it all into the tree as-is.  There will be a few
places which ended up getting missed, but we can pick those up on a second
round and then we rename task_struct.pid to
task_struct.dont_use_me_directly_pid so that any remaining, future or
out-of-tree usages of ->pid get reliably broken.
