Hello!
When i was first trying linux kernel 2.6.7 (compiled with gcc 3.3.4) i
always got the following error during booting:
irq 11: nobody cared!
Stack pointer is garbage, not printing trace
handlers:
[<c027d140>] (ata_interrupt+0x0/0x140)
[<f0c512e0>] (usb_hcd_irq+0x0/0x70 [usbcore])
Disabling IRQ 11
As an effect no device which is assigned to irq 11 did work (e.g.
soundcard and sata-controller)
Currently i'm testing my system without "noapic nolapic" parameters and
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC=y
enabled.
I use an Asus A7N8X2.0 Deluxe mainboard (nForce2 chipset).
With previous versions of the linux kernel i never had this problem.
Any suggestions.
greetings,
Daniel
