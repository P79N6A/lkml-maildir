vfs_read expects userspace pointer, so we must do set_fs() at least
around vfs_read, and so I left it around whole function, to minimize
changes in code.
In original message I asked whether I should convert firmware loader to 
the "if (error) goto quit;" style to move error handling to one place, 
but only answer I got was 'Ask Rob' ;-)
And as I do not have sound hardware which needs firmware, I do not
want to make more changes than absolutely necessary to the code I cannot
verify. Of course if you'll find someone with hardware...
