Netfilter HOWTO has been obsoleted by a clean division between:
Networking Concepts HOWTO
2.4 Packet Filtering HOWTO
2.4 NAT HOWTO
A 2.4 Routing HOWTO would complete the set.  My preference would be
for a HOWTO which doesn't assume anything beyond the (elementry) stuff
in the Networking Concepts HOWTO.
Not an easy task though: this HOWTO could easily run to 10k lines and
still not be complete.
Good luck!
Rusty.
