Whoops, you are right. However, even with, say, an extra PCI IDE controller,
the ordering of the drives within that controller is "as usual", e.g. the order
is "pri ma","pri sl","sec ma","sec sl", of course relative to the start of the
respective controller.

So how much weird cases do we have?

Developer... and about the user/admin? With a sparcbox (ran suse linux 7.3 the
last time it was powered on - 2.4 kernel, no udev - don't complain :),
replugging disks in put them at the end of the 'sd*' naming
chain, effectively killing the features of hotplug the machine itself offered.
(Oh, that OS starting with S.. managed it with the help of the behated/-loved
c?d?t?s? scheme, but that's OT.)
