No. Each architecture can already choose how it does its own "mmu_gather".
*IF* the architecture uses a per-cpu variable for this, *THEN* the 
architecture could also embed a "quicklist" in that per-cpu variable, and 
make use of that. If you were to do it that way, it would all work fine. 
So for example, if you actually want to use quicklists in the "generic" 
TLB-gather implementation, you should replace the
	struct page *pages[FREE_PTE_NR];
entry in the "struct mmu_gather" with a set of quicklists instead. 
Or, alternatively, you could decide to not use the generic version at all, 
and instead do a per-architecture one that uses the quicklists.
The problem with that commit that I just reverted was that it mixed the 
two, but not completely. It still kept them separate.
