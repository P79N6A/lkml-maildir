Both.  We spent a lot of time on this when I was at SGI working on IRIX.
I think we ended up with excellent SMP scalability and good real-time
latency.  There is also some academic research that suggests that
the extra overhead of a dynamic adaptive spinlock usually outweighs
any possible gains.

I think the first order performance problem of a heavily contended lock
is not how it is implemented, but the fact that it is heavily contended.
In IRIX we spent a lot of time looking for these bottlenecks and
re-architecting to avoid them.  (This would mean minimizing the shared
accesses in your examples.)
