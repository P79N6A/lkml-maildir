  I found out that drivers/pcmcia/pxa2xx_base.c from handhelds.org tree
was a bit modified. I tried both vanilla kernel tree and vanilla+this
patch -- both worked with pcnet_cs, and neither one with orinoco card.
As far as I understand, handhelds.org modification makes use of memory
clock instead of cpu clock for calculations. But even when using old
handhelds.org driver with modified formulas, orinoco card won't
initialize.
  I'm not really sure how things should be calculated, I'll try ask
folks who modified the hh.org driverto see what could cause the
problems.
