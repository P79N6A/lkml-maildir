Hi,
I am loosing characters in serial transfer in case user buffer size is very small. This loss is due to tty buffer overflow.
I am using pl1011 serial driver. Hardware provided hardware flow control (RTS/CTS) based on FIFO thresholds. At the same time software also control the RTS/CTS pins in case of uart_throttle i.e. tty buffer overflow. In my hardware, software control of pins is not possible if it's already done by hardware. So effectilvely uart_throttle() defined in serial driver core framework function has no effect.
Can anybody help me in this regard?
Regards
Manish
