Hi,
I just installed Linux on a new machine. It has two Celeron CPUs,
IDE, and two network cards, a 3Com 3c905B and a LinxPro. I'm
currently using 2.2.14pre12 with IDE and reiserfs patches.
I finally got the 3Com working, using Don's driver version 0.99L
which is not in the kernel yet. Btw. the driver from 3Com (ver 1.0.0)
was totally unstable. I don't know if they have a working version.
The main problem now is the LinxPro adapter. Both the current version
and the version from Davicom (1.26) crash the machine during or after
ifconfig. I got some oopses wich didn't make it into the log and
are too long to write down (no useful info on the screen). Could
it be that this driver is simply not SMP safe?
(This is the dmfe module for the 9102F chip)
I'll be glad to provide additional info and testing.
Thanks for any help.
hjb
