I would try to:
* implement foo_poll() in the kernel driver.
* the user space app calls select() or poll().
WaitForSingleObject should be easy to replace.
WaitForMultipleObjects could be tricky if you wait for different events
(e.g. wait until either the kernel driver has new data, or another
process exits, or a pthread_mutex is released by another thread).

Good luck, I hope you release the kernel driver under GPL
