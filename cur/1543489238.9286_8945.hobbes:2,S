Yes, and for alphas I malloc() and read() with byte swapping. It's not
that I can't support LE machines (I develop under Linux/x86, after
all), it's just that performance on LE machines is much lower than BE
machines where I can safely mmap(). Also, the LE machines require swap
space at least equal to the dataset size. When we're talking about
datasets in the gigabytes, this becomes a problem (especially if
multiple users want to view the same dataset).

I've worked at or visited ATNF, AAO, SydUni, UNSW, MSSSO, NRAO, UMN,
NCSA(Illinois), UCalgary, DRAO, Uni Durham, NFRA, RUG and Uni Bonn and
with the exception of Uni Bonn, they're all dominated by BE machines.
