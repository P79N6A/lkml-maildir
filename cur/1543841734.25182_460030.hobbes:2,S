There is a fix (commit 653d5b55c0125dca97a420b9a5e77fad7adbf3f0) for mac_suspended assertions in the
latest wireless-2.6. If you just want that fix, use the following:

     /* Noise calculation context */
     memset(&bcm->noisecalc, 0, sizeof(bcm->noisecalc));
If this patch is already in your code, and you are still getting the assertions, please let me know.
