Subject: Unresolved symbols in joystick modules in test4

In the transition from test4-pre6 to test4, the code that forced CONFIG_USB to
be defined when joystick was being compiled was removed. This seems to break
the joystick modules when one is not using USB (depmod finds lots of unresolved
symbols).
