Adam,
  I'm not sure the proper thing to do is necessarily remove the
device_shutdown() call.  I did the changes to the device_shutdown()
function, but as far as I can tell, it should not have changed any
behavior like that - all I did was re-work the logic a bit.  In any
case, what I did submit to the mailing list was absent a small piece of
code (a change to device.h), and the person who forwarded it onto Linus
(thank you!) did make a change to make it compile without that.
  Please try this patch to the base 2.5.42 code, and let me know if this
returns it to the previous behavior?
