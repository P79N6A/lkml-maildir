Ok, let me summarize it. we now have two options:
1. using 'platform_notify'
platform_notify only has one parameter 'struct device', we must know the
exact bus type of a device. We can identify the bus type from its name
(such as 'pci', 'ide'), but it's quite some ugly. Or we can add a 'type'
flag in the 'struct bus_type' to indicate the exact bus type which Greg
doesn't like it. One shortcoming is the method hasn't good flexibility,
we must add a new type whenever a new bus type is added.
2. using per-bus type 'platform_bind'
Every bus type defines a 'platform_bind', so we know the exact bus type
naturally in platform_bind. The method can't handle special devices,
such as PCI root bridge, which hasn't a bus type, so no 'platform_bind'
is invoked for them. we must use some tricky methods to work around.
Another concern is the chaos if many platforms define 'platform_bind'
for a bus type, which isn't a big problem currently.
Greg, it seems you tend to option 2, isn't it?
Thanks,
Shaohua
