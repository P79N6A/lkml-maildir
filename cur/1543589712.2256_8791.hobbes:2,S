Everything is there. SCSI and ISDN have the equivalent devices of the
"lo" driver for the networking layer. Or the equivalent of
tun/tap devices for the ethernet layer.
It just have to be an config.in option in UML and every other
adapters switched off.
The problem is: I still do not really get how UML really works.
Many of the mapping rules (Kernel machanism on normal arch ->
UML) are not quite clear to me.
Is there a paper or sth. like that describing the design a bit
more in detail? I only found usage papers on the user-mode-linux
home page.
