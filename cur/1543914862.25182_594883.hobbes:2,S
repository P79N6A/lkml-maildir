Warning: I have not run any benchmarks. One thing I am (more or less)
able to measure is my own ability to headshot in some games like UT99.
The other thing is to see if flash videos stutter or die under load.
Please remember, this is about desktop usage - not numbers.

Hello Ingo, LKML,
Here are the results of a few informal tests (flash videos, playing
UT99, and looping kernel compilation in background).
* 2.6.21.5 is OK but interactivity is not good (i.e. I sometimes
  get "lag" under load).
* 2.6.22-ck1 is better, interactivity-wise, but becomes unusable under
  load (i.e. a kernel compilation + desktop switch breaks flash
  videos ; UT99 is too slow when compiling too).
* 2.6.23-rc6 is... perfect, as good as can be on my old PC. Flash never
  breaks even on high I/O or compilation load (within reasonable
  limits). Gaming is great, which wasn't the case before.
Thanks for the good work.
Best,
François
