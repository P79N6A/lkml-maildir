Thanks for responding, Con.  But I want to make sure that an important
point doesn't escape your attention.  It appears that tasks get trapped
on the stalled sibling, even when they could run on some other cpu.  The
load-balancer does not understand that the sibling is temporarily out of
service so it actually balances tasks to it.  And since it's idle, it
may attract tasks to it more than other cpus (thanks to SD_WAKE_IDLE). 
I think this is a serious bug.
