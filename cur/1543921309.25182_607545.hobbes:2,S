Let me get this straight:
  1) You create the file on the server
  2) You readdir the file from the client
  3) You stat the file from the client
....with the result that the file disappears from sight on the server?
That would indicate some dcache issues with the server code. What export
options are you using?

I doubt the new patches fix the problem if I did indeed get your method
right.
