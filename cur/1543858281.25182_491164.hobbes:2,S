Subject: [PATCH 2.6.19-git19] BUG due to bad argument to ieee80211softmac_assoc_work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This didn't get much attention on bugzilla and I figured it was
important enough to forward along to the whole list since it's been
lingering around in ieee80211-softmac since 19-git5 at least.
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7657
Somebody was passing the whole mac device structure to
ieee80211softmac_assoc_work instead of just the assocation work, which
lead to much death and locking.
Attached is a patch that fixes this (the actual change is two lines
but context provided in patch for review).  The dmesg containing call
trace is attached to the bugzilla entry above.
