Hello!

This is wrong. The address is not autogenerated unless SO_PASSCRED
is requested by security&compatibility reasons.
So, if the socket is SOCK_DGRAM it is anounymous and "send-only",
it is impossible to reply to it.

Yes, this is bug. The fix is enclosed. It should return nil address.

Both of them are wrong.
