No. The windows are supposed to be in "pages", so what the code does is to
say
 - we read the start page and the end page
 - the end is up-to-and-including the final page, so if both start and end
   were "page 1" (0x1000), that actually means that the area is from
   0x1000 to 0x1fff

Now, the masking off of the low bits is very possibly the right thing. I
don't have the documentation on what the low bits contain in front of me,
I'll try to find it. But I suspect that _that_ part of the patch may be
right.
Does it work for you if you do a minimal one-liner patch
-	start = config_readl(socket, offset);
+	start = config_readl(socket, offset) & ~0xfff;
 	end = config_readl(socket, offset+4) | 0xfff;
 	if (start && end > start) {
 		res->start = start;
 		res->end = end;
instead?

This sounds like a separate problem, and might be due to not ACK'ing the
changes (ie writing the status register with all ones) always. But we _do_
do the
	cb_writel(socket, CB_SOCKET_EVENT, -1);
	cb_writel(socket, CB_SOCKET_MASK, CB_CDMASK);
at init time - I wonder if they should be done in the reverse order..
