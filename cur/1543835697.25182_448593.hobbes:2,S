Oh, and before people start laughing at me, here are some personal or
friend's experiences with different filesystems:
  * reiser3: A HDD containing a reiser3 filesystem was tried to be
    booted on a machine that fucked up DMA writes. Fortunately, it
    crashed really soon (right after going for read-write.)  After
    rebooting the HDD on a sane PeeCee, it refused to boot. Starting
    off some rescue system showed an _empty_ root filesystem.
  * A friend's XFS data partition (portable USB/FireWire HDD) once
    crashed due to being hot-unplugged off the USB.  The in-kernel XFS
    driver refused to mount that thing again, and the tools also
    refused to fix any errors. (Don't ask, no details at my hands...)
  * JFS just always worked for me. Though I've never ever had a broken
    HDD where it (or it's tools) could have shown how well-done they
    were, so from a crash-recovery point of view, it's untested.
  * Being a regular ext3 user, I had lots of broken HDDs containing
    ext3 filesystems. For every single case, it has been easy fixing
    the filesystem after cloning. Just _once_, fsck wasn't able to fix
    something, so I did it manually with some disk editor. This worked
    well because the on-disk data structures are actually as simple as
    they are.
ext3 always worked well for me, so why should I abandon it?
