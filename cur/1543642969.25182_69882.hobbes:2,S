Me too.  Dual PIII, 2.5.34+localhacks.  It's happened a couple
of times.  The system locks up and the CPU fans go nuts.  In X, so
no info available.
There are a few locking problems in 2.5.34 which _may_ be fixed
now, but they only seem to affect CLONE_THREAD.  It would be worth
grabbing the latest `gzipped full patch' from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/dwmw2/bk-2.5/
though.
