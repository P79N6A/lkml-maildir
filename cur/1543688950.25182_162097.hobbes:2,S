I like this idea.
You could handle the priority starvation with a "old process" boost.
(i don't know which would be simpler or if there is something even
simpler out there)
This would ensure that all processes are run sooner or later. Real
cpuhogs would run very seldom due to being starved, but run when they
get the boost. On a loaded system this might be desirable since most
login tools would be "normal" or "high pri" from the get go.
(there might be a problem with locks though)
This should also work hand in hand with timeslice changes imho. Aswell
as process preemption. If we assume that cpu hogs has work that they
want to get done, let em do it for as long as possible. If something
"important" happens, it'll be preempted right?

Most definitely.
