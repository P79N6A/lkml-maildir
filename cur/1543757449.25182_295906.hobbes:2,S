I wouldn't want to pass all the battery info (UPSes can be even more
complex, able to switch on/off individual sockets, etc) through input,
just the basic events:
	AC power on/off
	battery full/normal/low/critical/(fail)
Then the other power-related events
	Lid open/closed
	Power button
	Sleep button
I think that's all you need to trigger actions. You don't need the exact
percentage of the battery, and you don't need the exact AC voltage at
input. 
Nice graphics battery monitors in X can gather their information from
the platform specific sources, since they'll need it all in the greatest
detail.
PS.
full = not charging
normal = OK state, charging if AC
low = better shutdown if you don't want to stress the battery
      (namely LiIon batteries prefer not to be discharged too much)
critical = last chance to shutdown cleanly
fail = battery present, but doesn't work.
A server, while booting should wait for battery going at least to 'low'
before mounting system read/write, otherwise subsequent power failures
might cause damage.
