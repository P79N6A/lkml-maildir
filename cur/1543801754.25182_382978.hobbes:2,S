Dmix _is_ a context switch, you know?

You only get context switches if you go through plugins, which is
pretty much the same way alsa currently is, isn't it?

The ALSA kernel API better go documented soon or I'll have to document
it myself.  Security and openness-wise, it is just not acceptable to
have a user-accessive kernel API kept under wraps.

Of course.  You won't have to though, since you claim the API is
upwards compatible.

Good.

Every application that does inter-process communication has potential
protocol-level security issues.  Current ALSA creates two shared
memory zones and one semaphore with group write permissions.  In a
setup where a number of people are in the same group (student group
for instance), are you 100% positive that another user cannot take
control of the running application by writing the right values at the
right time in these zones?  Shared memory is the most dangerous
communication vector there is when the other application is
untrustable.

I am indeed not really interested in reproducing the dll hell of
windows in linux.  I want simple but really efficient interfaces to
kernel services which then give the possibility to build special needs
libraries over it[1].  At that point you're designing an API for a
specific class of professional audio users and essentially telling all
the other users to bugger off.  Bad karma.

Yeah, that's the second time you're saying that.  I'm sure Dave Jones
will be really happy to know that his impressions were mistaken and
his bugzilla was just having hallucinations:

Like all the programs I had which segfaulted after the alsa upgrade
that changed set_rate_near.  Beautiful versioning there guys.

Yeah, also known as "the stick which broke jwz's back".

It would be exactly as complicated because of the static link issue.
  OG.
[1] SDL, jack and slmodem are I think good examples
