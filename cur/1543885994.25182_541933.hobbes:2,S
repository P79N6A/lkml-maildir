And also out-of-kernel drivers for things like webcams, which have been
naively written for x86 little endian and have no concept of endian
neutrality.  In some cases it's just easier to run LE instead of
fighting with the driver code.
BTW, for the consumer-level IXP42x devices (like the NSLU2) the
performance difference is *completely* overwhelmed by slowness in the
rest of the system.
