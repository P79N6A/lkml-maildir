Hi,
I noticed a strange behaviour with the configuration of my PS/2 mouse.
menuconfig defines CONFIG_PSMOUSE_MODULE and undefines #CONFIG_PSMOUSE,
when I tell it I want PS/2 Mouse support. And strangely it is a [*] in the
menu and no <M>.
Since there is no module code for this type of mice, PS/2 mice don't work
when using menuconfig (at least on my box.)
cu,
Lars
P.S. Please CC any answers to my, because I'm not subscribe to this list.
