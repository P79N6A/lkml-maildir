Ehm it's already there, one could argue that it's pretty core
functionality for this type of stuff :-). It's called
blk_queue_get_tag(q, tag), and it's in blkdev.h. However, I agree that
we should just move it into ll_rw_blk.c. That gets better documented as
well. Could you redo that part?

I completely agree with this, blk_queue_start_tag() should not need to
know about these things so just checking if the request is already
marked tagged is fine with me. But please make that a warning, like
	if (rq->flags & REQ_QUEUED) {
		printk("blk_queue_start_tag: rq already tagged\n");
		return 1;
	}
Also, you need to fix drivers/ide/tcq.c to make sure it doesn't call
blk_queue_start_tag() for non REQ_CMD requests. Ah wait, I'll just
change that. And also _please_ fix the comment about REQ_CMD and not
just the code, it's doesn't stand anymore.

Cool! Looking forward to reviewing it later today.
