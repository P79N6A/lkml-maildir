I get the same problem, but I never get a oops, because the system is
completely locked up. The wierd part about this is that if I leave a command
prompt open, I can type in a command, but it never gets executed. I even
tried to use the sysrq to get information and that doesn't even work,
because syslog is dead. Here is my system information. After about 20 hours
uptime server locks up.
Dell Poweredge 4200
2 - Pentium II - 333mhz
1 GIG ECC EDO RAM
Dell Perc2(Megaraid Controller) - Setup as WriteThru and DirectIO
Adaptec Duo Network Adapter
Using kernel 2.4.21 with the latest 1.18i driver from LSILogic for the
Megaraid, no other patches, built from source code only
I am a Linux From Scratch  user, I have used the same config file since
kernel 2.4.17 with no problems, problems first appeared in kernel 2.4.20. I
have had the  system checked, the memory tested, and changed raid
controllers. I have even checked cron events at the time it locks up
If you have a patch you would like me to test send it and I can report back
in 24 hours. I do have the capability of hooking up a laptop to the serial
port of the computer to collect statistics.
