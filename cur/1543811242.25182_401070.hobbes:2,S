Subject: OSS msnd build failure

During some build tests of 2.6.16-rc4-mm2 with  'make randconfig'  I
found this build failure :
  ...
  LD      drivers/built-in.o
  CC      sound/sound_core.o
  CC      sound/sound_firmware.o
  CC      sound/oss/msnd.o
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/etc/sound/msndperm.bin', needed
by `sound/oss/msndperm.c'.  Stop.
make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make[1]: *** [sound/oss] Error 2
make: *** [sound] Error 2
I must admit I don't know how to fix it, so I'll have to just report it.
