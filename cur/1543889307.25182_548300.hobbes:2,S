cool patch! :-)

yeah, i like this alot.
The "struct sched_entity" abstraction looks very clean, and that's the 
main thing that matters: it allows for a design that will only cost us 
performance if group scheduling is desired.
If you could do a -v14 port and at least add minimal SMP support: i.e. 
it shouldnt crash on SMP, but otherwise no extra load-balancing logic is 
needed for the first cut - then i could try to pick all these core 
changes up for -v15. (I'll let you know about any other thoughts/details 
when i do the integration.)

yeah. It might even become more steps if someone wants to have a 
different, deeper hierarchy (at the price of performance). Containers 
will for example certainly want to use one more level.

yeah, agreed.

kernel builds dont really push scheduling micro-costs, rather try 
something like 'hackbench.c' to measure that. (kernel builds are of 
course one of our primary benchmarks.)

full steam ahead please! =B-)
