and why would you want that, instead of just:

dpkg -i foo.deb	# for the deb

Just want to extract the tar file?  Maybe something like
cat foo.tgz/gunzip
In which case (of course) foo.tgz/gunzip has exactly the same directory
contents as foo.tgz
Looks different, that's all.
In fact, for just about any syntax anyone could suggest, I can't really
see why you can't just replace all weird symbols with a slash and a
symbol.  Instead of
	foo.tgz#utar
you have
	foo.tgz/#/utar
Only difference is, some things which used to require special tools can
now be serviced by less than what's in busybox.
