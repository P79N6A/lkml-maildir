I've been using NAT with my DSL connection for a year and a half or so now.  In
practice there are very few things which don't work, or can't be made to work
if they're important enough.  Streaming media stuff was a little troublesome,
but there is an RTSP proxy with works fine.
Perhaps you have a particular protocol in mind which is problematic with NAT,
but they are rare in the general scheme of things.
