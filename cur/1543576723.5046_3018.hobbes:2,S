Subject: Which resource is temporarily unavailable

I'm getting
zsh: fork failed: resource temporarily unavailable
on a machine.  It has 510 processes which are mostly
asleep, running under various user ids.
Multiple user accounts get the error when it occurs, though
root seems to continue to work fine.
How do I determine which resource is the problem so I can
fix the shortage?
System is Linux 2.2.18 with 384MB RAM.
Thanks,
