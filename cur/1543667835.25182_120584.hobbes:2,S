I think you will find that most Linux kernel developers agree w/ you :)
That said, iSCSI error recovery can be considered as supporting some of 
what multipathing and failover accomplish.  iSCSI can be shoving bits 
through multiple TCP connections, or fail over from one TCP connection 
to another.

...not if your iSCSI implementation is up to spec.  ;-)

VFS+VM.  But, agreed.
