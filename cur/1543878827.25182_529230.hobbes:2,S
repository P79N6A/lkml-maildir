Can irqpoll be enhanced to show which interrupts are being misrouted?
It looks like it should be possible to show the actual interrupt,
the driver that is handling it, and what interrupt it's expecting
in a /proc file -- just what happened last time irqpoll resolved
the interrupt would be better than nothing.
