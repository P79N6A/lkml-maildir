POSIX IPC filespace doesnt have to be visible as the normal file

Actually putting ipc under devfs or proc isnt too daft. However the only
case we need to deal with is 'where do I mount ipc if I mount it'. That is
policy so belongs in user space.
As it stands now if you forget to mount /proc odd things occur. It hasnt killed
anyone despite predictions that /proc being a real fs would cause doom gloom
and the end of the world made several years ago 8)
