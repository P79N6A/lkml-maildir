The software architecture is simply wrong. He wants to DMA data
into user-space, continuously, faster than the CPU can do anything
with the data. If the data is anything more than an experiment
in "how fast can DMA write to RAM", then the data needs to be
used, i.e., processed. In the real world of high-speed data
processing (like image processing), one writes, using DMA or
whatever, into a buffer that is to be processed. DMA is often
used so that more data can be received while the previously-
received data is being processed. The buffers are usually
allocated as a linked-list or as a pair of buffers to be
ping/ponged. Allocating a gigantic buffer for any purpose,
including sorting databases, is simply wrong.
Data processing involves accessing data in arrays or
structures that emulate arrays of aggregate types. This
means that nearby elements are usually accessed, not elements
that are randomly scattered throughout address-space. This
locality of action is well known and is in fact why
paging is possible to provide virtual address-space.
Allocation of DMA pages by the user will fail. This is
because many of the user's pages will likely point to
the exact same page of (probably non-existant) RAM.
That's how a virtual memory system works. In fact,
allocation of virtual address space from user-mode
just tells the kernel not to seg-fault the user if
an access is made that hasn't been allocated yet.
When the access is made, a page-fault occurs and
the kernel tries to find some RAM to satisfy that access.
So, the physical addresses of any pages of allocated
RAM are not known until the pages are accessed. With
demand-zero paging, they all point to the same page
and won't change until an attempt to write to the
page occurs. After that, they may even change again.
Attempts to prevent that using mlockall() may simply
return -ENOMEM with such a large amount of virtual
address allocated. Getting the physical addresses
of user-mode virtual address RAM, involves searching
through page-tables to find out where the kernel
got a particular allocation from. This is because
every process has the exact same virtual address-space
but they share only the kernel and 'C' runtime
library address-space. All other virtual to physical
address-translations are different for different
processes.
This is why the driver must obtain the DMA pages and
the user must use mmap() to map those pages into its
address space. It's not a matter of being "easier",
it's a matter of it being the only way that will work.
Also, if Mr. Koller insists upon doing the absurd, i.e.,
allocating gigabytes of DMA RAM, he is going to have to
reserve memory that only his driver knows about, using
the "mem=" parameter on the boot command line. Then the
"extra" RAM above the kernel can be mapped using
ioremap_nocache() and made available for DMA and mmap().
