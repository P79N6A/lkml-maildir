There is a line missing in include/linux/i2c-id.h
Add:
#define I2C_DRIVER_ID_SAB3036    26    /* some number */
2.3.49 keeps adding ide-cd and cdrom modules needlessly. As I have
crontab set up to remove unused modules every five minutes, I find that
these two are loaded and unloaded every five minutes.
Finally, on initialisation of eth0, syslog reports:
kernel: ip_local_deliver: bad non-lo skb:
kernel: skb: pf=2 (unowned) dev=eth0 len=216
kernel: PROTO=17 166.12.18.163:1027 255.255.255.255:41508 L=216 S=0x00
I=41125 F=0x0000 T=125
