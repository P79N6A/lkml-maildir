Kernel calling a proggie is no problem... CONFIG_KMOD does it, and Linus
has suggest that hotplugging a device needs to fire off a script, like
	/sbin/hotplug-net eth0 # new eth0 just inserted
If hotplugging executes an action, then updating the PCI device name
should become part of that.  That implies that the kernel won't do any
of the executing...  /sbin/hotplug-net will initiate the device name
update, so the kernel needs a way to update the device name at the
request of userspace.  It could be something as simple as 
	echo name > /proc/bus/pci/00/0a.0/name
or something more complex...
