Heh, well no. Video is as dead as it can get :\ No known trick revives
it after a resume . But at least the machine doesn't freeze after S3.

Of course it is :) It's more a proof-óf-concept that pci-resume is

further. In the meantime this patch works for me.

Sorry, that's beyond my abilities. That's why I'm posting here. I'm not
