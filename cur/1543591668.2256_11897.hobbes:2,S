Subject: Brown-paper-bag bug in m68k, sparc, and sparc64 config files
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This bug unconditionally disables a configuration question -- and it's
so old that it has propagated across three port files, without either
of the people who did the cut and paste for the latter two noticing it.
This sort of thing would never ship in CML2, because the compiler
would throw an undefined-symbol warning on BLK_DEV_ST.  The temptation
to engage in sarcastic commentary at the expense of people who still
think CML2 is an unnecessary pain in the butt is great.  But I will
restrain myself.  This time.
