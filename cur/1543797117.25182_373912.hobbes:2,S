I have a small question: in my view, this patch series is a small
step towards implementing the usb-serial drivers The Right Way, as it
removes a a bit of duplicated code. If we start to do The Big Change to
serial_core , probably we would make further refactorings on these parts,
going towards The Right Way to implement the drivers.
My question would be: where would the small refactorings belong, while
the big change to serial_core is work in progress? I would like them
to go to some tree for testing, while the work is being done, instead
of pushing lots of changes later, but I don't know if there is someone
who we could send them.

I would love it, but I will be on vacations in two weeks. So, probably
on January.
My wife is lucky that I won't have a notebook available during our
vacations.  8)
