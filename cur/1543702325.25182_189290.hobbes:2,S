I know that this is probably wishful thinking, but "they" always say
that the only stupid question is the one you don't ask.  (Whoever "they"
are, they are decidedly wrong about this, BTW.)
I have a patch that adds an x86-specific sysctl.  I believe that every-
thing is properly #ifdef'ed, but it would be awful nice to be able to
ensure that I haven't broken building on non-x86 architectures.  Is
there any way to do this without building a full-fledged cross-compiler
toolchain?  (And if not, does anyone know of a good HOWTO on setting up
such a toolchain?)
Thanks!
