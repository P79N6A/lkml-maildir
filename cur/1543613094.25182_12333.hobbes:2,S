I'm looking at the bio changes for ps2esdi.  The driver
appears to no longer work compiled when into the kernel.
The ps2esdi_init call has been removed from
ll_rw_blk.c:blk_dev_init.  Where is the new/correct place
to call this from?  This appears to be the same way with
many of the other "old" block drivers as well.
Thanks, and not on the list,
