A log log time ago (about 2.3.xx) I actually posted a patch
which was the preparation for *EXACTLY* this step and
which contained a bit of *OBVIOUS* other cleanup. However those times
I requested to get a confirmation that if I start to work *SERIOUSLY* on
it
then it wouldn't be for nothing. I don't intend to spend my
spare time on such a thing without knowing IN FRONT
that this work won't get ignored due to the IGNORANCE of some person.
I didn't get any clean response... 
Anyway if you ask whatever I'm able to prepare such a patch the answer
is - obviously yes.

exagerous waiste of resources where many profesionalls don't wan't to
be involved with - however if you would dare to invite me to France for
a hack session of about 2-3 days I would deligtefully take hollidays 
from my current job or a prolonged weekend 
and do it anyway whatever "big L" says (or doesnt say ;-).
