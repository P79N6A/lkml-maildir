If the kernel has CONFIG_SMP or CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC enabled,
then it's known Dell Inspiron bug.
A patch to fix the problem has been posted here numerous
times, but it's not yet in any standard kernel (and likely
never will be since the powers that be just toss it in
/dev/null w/o comment).
To fix it, you can either ensure that both config options
mentioned above are OFF, or you can get the following patches
patch-boot-time-ioremap-2.4.18-pre7
patch-early-dmi-scan-2.4.18-pre7
patch-dmi-apic-fixups-2.4.18-pre7
from 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/kernel-patches/2.4/
and apply them in the order listed.
