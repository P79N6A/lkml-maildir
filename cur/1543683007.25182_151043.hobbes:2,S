  Uhhuh, have you people lost your sense o humour?
  Did actually _anyone_ red the Texan history rms describes on his site?
  I personally find the history (where rms was denied to continue his
lisp machine lectures given that absurd excuse he was commiting a
nasal sex with dead plants) quite amusing...
  But here you go, just care to read it before commenting.
  Besides all i find rms diary rather interesting.

 I`m sure there is a link to a such his statement archived on the web.
 Google returns too much results to be useful, so i`d be rather delighted
if you provide me with en exact link to this his statement.

  Do yo mean rms reacted negatively to the existence of OSL?
  I`m interested in that.
