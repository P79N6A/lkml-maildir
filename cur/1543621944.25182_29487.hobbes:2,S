The defaults are just 1:1 representation of the current define_xxx
statements. These can be of course later moved or depreciated or whatever.

For most cases I've seen it can be very simply defined with:
	(a && b && ...) = min(a, b, ...)
	(a || b || ...) = max(a, b, ...)
	for 'n'=0, 'm'=1, 'y'=2
I have to check the other cases and I haven't look too closely, yet, but
e.g. in this case it goes wrong:
config: FB_MATROX_G450
  dep_tristate
    prompt:       G450/G550 second head support
    dep: (VT? && EXPERIMENTAL? && FB? && EXPERIMENTAL? && PCI? && FB_MATROX??!=n && FB_MATROX_G100?)
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G450 can be defined to 'y' and CONFIG_FB_MATROX to 'm',
the result is that the build goes wrong. By removing '!=n' above rule
would produce the correct result.
Do you have some real examples?

No python. Just c, flex and bison. :-)
