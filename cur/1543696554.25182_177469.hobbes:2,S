Have you seen any problems with interrupt binding on 2.6.0-drv45003 ?
I tried this command to bind interrupt, but it does not work:
============================
cat  /proc/irq/165/smp_affinity
ffffffff00000000
echo 01 > /proc/irq/165/smp_affinity
cat  /proc/irq/165/smp_affinity
ffffffff00000000
===========================
There is nothing changed after binding.
One thing I see is it shows 16 digits "ffffffff00000000" on 2.6.0 while
only 8 digits in 2.4 .
Do I need any special ways to bind interrupt ?
Thanks.,
