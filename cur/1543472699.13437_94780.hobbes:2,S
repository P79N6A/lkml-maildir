Not a good idea -- the kernel still thinks that your main module depends on
your firmware module and will happily dereference pointers to it after it
vanishes. :-(
What you _could_ do, however, is to explicitly load it with
request_module() from within your init_module function, find the code
which loads the firmware with get_module_symbol(), call it, and forget all
about it.

As of now it's 234 hours until the Euro is introduced. You may envy the
Europeans, as we're going to have twice the fun. :-)
