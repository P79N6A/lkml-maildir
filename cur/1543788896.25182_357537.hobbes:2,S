  Hello, all.
  This isn't really linux kernel related but I wrote this to track LKML 
discussion threads better and I hope this can make following LKML a 
little bit easier for others too.
  What matchreply does is to enable procmail to deliver a message into 
the folder containing its associated thread.  So, when you find an 
interesting thread on LKML, just move the thread into your 'interested' 
folder, and then all follow-up messages will be delievered there.
  matchreply assumes Maildir format folders and uses inotify, so you 
need kernel version >= 2.6.13.
  README (explains how to setup .procmailrc) is at
