The VM currently has support for letting vmas define their own memory
policies - so specifying that a file-backed vma gets its memory from a
particular set of memory nodes would accomplish that for the fake-node
approach. The mechanism for setting up the per-file/per-vma policies
would probably involve something originating in struct inode or struct
address_space.
