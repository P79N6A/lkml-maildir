It drops from UDMA/100 to UDMA/66 for the disk, but stays at UDMA/33 for 
the optical drive.  If I have only the disk on that controller, the disk 
still drops to UDMA/66.

I've tried different cabling solutions, including round and flat IDE 
cables.  What might cause "electrical noise"?  Are 44-40 pin adapters 
reliable?
