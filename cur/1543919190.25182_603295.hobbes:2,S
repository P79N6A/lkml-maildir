Yes.  But with #2 below, your next try is the runqueue/CPU that is the
next best candidate (after the trylock fails).  The 'hope' is that there
is more than one candidate CPU to push the task to.  Of course, you
always want to try and find the 'best' candidate.  My thoughts were that
if you could find ANY cpu to take the task that would be better than
sending the IPI everywhere.  With multiple runqueues/locks there is no
way you can be guaranteed of making the 'best' placement.  So, a good
placement may be enough.
