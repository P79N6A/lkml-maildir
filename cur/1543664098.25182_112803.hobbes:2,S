Subject: [BUG] 2.5.63: ESR killed my box!

SMP box, compiled for UP with CONFIG_LOCAL_APIC=y freezes on boot with
last lines:
	POSIX conformance testing by UNIFIX
	masked ExtINT on CPU#0
	ESR value before enabling vector: 00000008
	[ Freeze here ]
With SMP, it boots fine (then freezes mysteriously a few mins after
boot, which is what I am still chasing):
	masked ExtINT on CPU#0
	ESR value before enabling vector: 00000000
	ESR value after enabling vector: 00000000
	...
Don't know exactly what kernel this first happened, I usually run SMP.
Clues?
Rusty.
