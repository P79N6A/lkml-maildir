Do we? Where?  AFAIK we just do some resetting after cpu frequency
changes, but on C3 TSC is just disabled globally.
That is better than it sounds.
Most systems don't have C3 right now. And on those that have
(laptops) it tends to be not that critical because they normally
don't run workload where gettimeofday() is really time critical
(and nobody expects them to be particularly fast anyways)
[... proposal for per CPU TSC state snipped ...]
All is being worked on.
