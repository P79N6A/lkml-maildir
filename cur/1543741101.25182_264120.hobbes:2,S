 We don't disable APIC right now, so this may only become true once it's
done (e.g. disable_local_APIC() is called from here).

 I don't think keeping an inaccurate comment is good.  Simply add it back 
if it becomes relevant.

 I disagree.  If the firmware performs any actions on hardware without
asking the OS for permission, it *must* be prepared for it to be in any
possible state and handle it correctly, including any transitional states
(as it does respect spinlocks).  Otherwise it's buggy.
 Alan, referring to your statement: it's like stating we must only use the
text mode of the display adapter, because that's the state it's left in by
the firmware and it may not expect any other state.

 I don't insist on any particular message though -- the following one
should hopefully suit you as more neutral (but you risk questions: "Why
doesn't Linux enable the APIC anymore?").

 Done.
 Here's a new patch, updated for the 2.6.9 release.
