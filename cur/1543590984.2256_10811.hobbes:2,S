I think its better if we just remove " + inactive_target / 3" here ---
callers already account for the inactive_target when trying to
calculate the free target anyway.
Example: 
static int refill_inactive(unsigned int gfp_mask, int user)
{
        int count, start_count, maxtry;
        count = inactive_shortage() + free_shortage();
