IF prio_tree gets merged and IF we plan to go by this vma ordering
solution for fixing vmtruncate vs. mremap race, then the vma_merge
in the copy_vma can bite us. The prio_tree only keeps the vmas that
_exactly_ map the same file pages in a list. If two vmas map different
set of file pages, then the ordering between them can change under
us if we drop i_shared_sem.
If we decide to go with the ordering solution, then my plan is to
setup an identical new_vma (that exactly maps same file pages as vma)
at new_addr and move the page tables. If the move fails, then use
vma_relink_file. If the move is successful, then we can do vma_merge.
I think we can think about these changes later. No hurry at this point.
Thanks,
Rajesh
