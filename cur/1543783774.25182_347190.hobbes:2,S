	In OCFS2 we call readonly+journal+connected-to-cluster "soft
readonly".  We're a live node, other nodes know we exist, and we can
flush pending transactions during the rw->ro transition.  In addition,
we can allow a ro->rw transition.
	The no-journal+no-cluster-connection mode we call "hard
readonly".  This is the mode you get when a device itself is readonly,
because you can't do *anything*.
