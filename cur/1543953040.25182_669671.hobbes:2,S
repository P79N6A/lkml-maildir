That's why I said "gone through the prepare() stage" instead of saying 
"after prepare() was called".  Yes, if there's no driver bound then 
there's no method to call.  But the PM core will still pass the device 
to a subroutine whose job is to call the corresponding method, if one 
exists.

Let's say Task 0 is starting a sleep transition when Task 1 calls
driver_bind():
	Task 0				Task 1
	------				------
	down(&dev->sem) succeeds	down(&dev->sem) blocks
	Sees that dev has no driver
	  so there is no prepare
	  method to call
	up(&dev->sem)
					down() succeeds
					Sees that dev->power.prepared
					  flag isn't set
					Calls (drv->probe)(dev)
	Sets dev->power.prepared
	  flag
					drv tries to register a child
					  device and fails for no good
					  reason
One way to fix this is to set dev->power.prepared before releasing
dev->sem.  Another way to fix it is to have driver_bind() block
(as though it were frozen) whenever a system sleep is underway.
Which do you prefer?
