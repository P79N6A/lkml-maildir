Subject: [PATCH] MM : alloc_large_system_hash() can free some memory for non power-of-two bucketsize
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/18/110

alloc_large_system_hash() is called at boot time to allocate space for several large hash tables.
Lately, TCP hash table was changed and its bucketsize is not a power-of-two anymore.
On most setups, alloc_large_system_hash() allocates one big page (order > 0) with __get_free_pages(GFP_ATOMIC, order). This single high_order page has a power-of-two size, bigger than the needed size.
We can free all pages that wont be used by the hash table.
On a 1GB i386 machine, this patch saves 128 KB of LOWMEM memory.
TCP established hash table entries: 32768 (order: 6, 393216 bytes)
