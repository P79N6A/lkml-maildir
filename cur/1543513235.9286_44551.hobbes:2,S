Alexey, we're  not trying to  find out  if we can  use an address,  my patch
simply finds  out passively if anyone  stole ours. It's simple and  it's non
intrusive.
You say "Broken switches may send our on ARP queries back to us"
I say "Ok, I'll ignore ARP packets that have our own MAC address"
I fail  to see what  you don't like  in my patch. It  will not catch  all IP
stealing cases, as I explained earlier, but it will get most of them and for
very little cost.

I  use arpwatch  already,  it doesn't  do  the same  thing. One  of the  big
differences is  that it  puts your interface  in promiscuous  mode. My patch
doesn't.

I fail to see why you see my check as a dirty trick. Note also that it's not
just windows that detects duplicate IPs, it's virtually all the other Unices
I've worked with (including Irix and Solaris).
Of course, it's then trivial to  write some program that monitors syslog and
displays some X window with a more readable warning (Irix does that already)
