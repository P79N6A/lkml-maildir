Yeah, I was looking at mainline.

I'd rather avoid the paramater removal for now, that makes it less
entangle, and it's an unrelated cleanup anyway.
Btw, there's more abuse of this sort in reiserfs.  Various other places
in xattr.c call dentry_open directly without the vfsmount aswell.  And
handling of an external journal uses filp_open which is similarly stupid,
it should use open_bdev_excl like xfs or the generic code to open the
main filesystem blockdevice.
