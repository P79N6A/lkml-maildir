Subject: [PATCH] docs: update sparse.txt with CHECK_ENDIAN
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/5/91

From: Bob Copeland <me@bobcopeland.com>
Update the sparse documentation to omit the -Wbitwise flag example (as
it is now passed by default), and document the kernel defines to enable
endianness checking.

+The optional make variable CF can be used to pass arguments to sparse.  The 
+build system passes -Wbitwise to sparse automatically.  To perform endianness
+checks, you may define __CHECK_ENDIAN__:
+
+        make C=2 CF="-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__"
+
+These checks are disabled by default as they generate a host of warnings.
