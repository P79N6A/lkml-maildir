revF not revE.  I think AMD was code-naming that K9 before the socket F
part was released.
revE was the last DDR rev of the K8 core.

Yes. They are and I have seen at least two motherboards that fit this
description.  I almost freaked out looking at a system with 16G and
only 4G setup to be cached.
The painful bit is I have also seen such a system with not all of the
lower 4G cached.  Which caused some interesting booting issues.
