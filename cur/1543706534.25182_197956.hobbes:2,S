Ok, this distinction helps a bit.

Actually, not yet.  Is it not possible for MIPS to determine the correct
cache operation to use if step #3 used a pci_dma_sync_single() with a
TO_DEVICE direction?  
I'm guessing that MIPS must have some kind of bridge cache in order to
require the pci_dma_sync_to_device_single() if I'm starting to follow
this.
