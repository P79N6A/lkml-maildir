Wouldn't that make inline assembly useless?  Suppose the contents is 
itself a pointer.  What about the pointed-to contents?
e.g.
    int x = 3;
    int *y = &x;
    int z;
    asm ("mov %1, %%rax; movl (%%rax), %0" : "=r"(z) : "g"(y) : "rax");
    assert(z == 3);

"asm volatile" prevents that (and I'm not 100% sure it's necessary).
