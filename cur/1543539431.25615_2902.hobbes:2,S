Subject: Bug in Linux 2.4.0-test4 re:  NFS quotas
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Summary-of-situation:  We are developing a 100-200Gb RAID disk array server
(which will scale much larger - for a database we are developing).  We have
been trialling the new 2.4.0-test4 kernel, regarding NFS support.  The trial
server also runs NIS to authenticate users to numerous remote boxes, using
netgroups etc.  The server is a fully patched to latest updates, of all redhat
available patches (even though this isn't kernel related, I thought I better
mention this).
Summary-of-problem:
Local quotas work for users, however for NIS authenticated users on the remote
machines quota is not enforced at all.  quota -v on the remote machine reports
the correct quota level for the user, however neither hard, or soft quotas are
enforced properly.  I have not checked the problem with non NIS authenicated
users - as that would be pointless in my situation.  Quotas do work locally on
the machine, just not on remote systems - ie users can fill the disk past their
quota.  The server system in this case is running the 2.4.0-test4 kernel with
nfs-utils version 0.1.9.1-1 (RPM nfs-utils-0.1.9.1-1.i386.rpm) (which contains
rquotad - presumably one is at fault).  The clients are running 2.2.16 (though
they will use 2.4.0 eventually), I suppose this could also be the fault source,
but in any case it is a bug between communication between kernel versions - if
this is the case, it is worrying!
Please CC me on all replies, as it will help me, as I am only on the digest
list.  Also contact me direct if you need any more information posted.
