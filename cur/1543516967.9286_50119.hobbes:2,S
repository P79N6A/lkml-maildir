Here are my /etc/fstab files:
In basic root:
>cat /etc/fstab 
/dev/sda1       /               ext2    defaults        1       1
/dev/sda6       /home           ext2    defaults,nosuid 1       2
/dev/sda5       /usr            ext2    defaults        1       2
/dev/sda3       /var            ext2    defaults,nosuid 1       2
/dev/sda7       /web            ext2    defaults,nosuid 1       2
/dev/md0        /web/pages      ext2    defaults,nosuid,usrquota        1      2
/dev/sda2       swap            swap    defaults        0       0
/dev/fd0        /mnt/floppy     ext2    noauto          0       0
none            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
none            /dev/pts        devpts  mode=0622       0       0
In chroot:
>cat /web/etc/fstab  
/dev/sda7       /               ext2    defaults        1       2
/dev/md0        /pages          ext2    defaults,usrquota       1       2
/dev/sda2       swap            swap    defaults        0       0
/dev/fd0        /mnt/floppy     ext2    noauto          0       0
none            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
none            /dev/pts        devpts  mode=0622       0       0
I need fstab in chroot for some reasons:
1. Users must think that they are in hole system ;)
2. Many programs (such ps, kill, top, etc.) need /proc to be mounted in
   chroot.
3. Procceses that allocates ptys (telnet) need /dev/pts/ to be mounted
   in chroot too.
