yes, this is the current implementation which
is more than sufficient, but I'm aware of the
potential issues here, and I have an experimental
patch sitting here which removes this race with
the following change:
 - doesn't store the accounted value but
   limit - accounted (i.e. the free resource)
 - uses atomic_add_return() 
 - when negative, an error is returned and
   the resource amount is added back
changes to the limit have to adjust the 'current'
value too, but that is again simple and atomic
best,
Herbert
PS: atomic_add_unless() didn't exist back then
(at least I think so) but that might be an option
too ...
