Hi Ingo,
   Yep, that solved it on my machine. I did have to patch using 'patch
-p1 -R' I think that's because the paths in your patch file are maybe
based on your work setup? I don't know. I'm amazed most of the time
that I can even do this stuff but with your help it seems to work out.
Thanks.
   Anyway, top no longer reports the 2.7% CPU usage from IRQ23. I do
see a little bit of CPU  consumption from X and firefox but that seems
pretty reasonable.
   If there is more you'd like me to look at or do on my end please let me know.
Cheers,
Mark
