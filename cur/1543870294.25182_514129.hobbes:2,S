Agh, only 10% in the worst case.
I think you can not even imagine what tricks network uses to get at
least aditional 1% out of the box.
Using such logic you can just abandon any further development, since it
work as is right now.

Should I read it like: we do not understand what it is and thus we do
not want it?

Threadlets behave much worse without event driven model, events can
behave worse without backed threads, they are mutually compensating.
I posted kevent/epoll benchmarks and related design issues too many 
times both with handmade applications (which might be broken as hell)
and popular open-source servers to repeat them again.
