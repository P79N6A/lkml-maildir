As it is already removed in Davej's cpufreq bitkeeper tree, I don't know if
it's still desired or not, but:

What: /proc/sys/cpu/*, sysctl and /proc/cpufreq interfaces to cpufreq (2.4.x interfaces)
When: January 2005
Files: drivers/cpufreq/: cpufreq_userspace.c, proc_intf.c
Why: /proc/sys/cpu/* has been deprecated since inclusion of cpufreq into the
     main kernel tree. It bloats /proc/ unnecessarily and doesn't work
     well with the "governor"-based design of cpufreq. 
     /proc/cpufreq/* has also been deprecated for a long time and was only
     meant for usage during 2.5. until the new sysfs-based interface became
     ready. It has an inconsistent interface which doesn't work well with
     userspace setting the frequency. The output from /proc/cpufreq/* can
     be emulated using "cpufreq-info --proc" (cpufrequtils).
     Both interfaces are superseded by the cpufreq interface in
     /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu%n/cpufreq/.
