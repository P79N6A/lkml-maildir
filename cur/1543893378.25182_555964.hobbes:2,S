I'd argue that the kexec approach does provide a fairly clean way to
selectively load device drivers --- simply leave out or keep as unloaded
modules the drivers that you don't want to load under the "save" and
"load" kernels.

I could be mistaken, but I think that bringing up the network interface
with a different IP address would prevent it from reseting existing TCP
connections, because it would never receive the packets for those
existing connections.

The reason I don't think this need to "re-setup" the context for
suspending should a significant problem in practice is that the setup
required under the "save kernel" should be exactly the same as that
required under the "load kernel".  In particular, it should likely be
possible to re-use exactly the same code (in the initrd/initramfs) to
locate the desired device, and/or perform any necessary device mapper
commands to create the necessary devices.  In the more complex case,
this "setup" might require setting up a network connection and/or
mounting a fuse filesystem.

Yes it does.  The issue is that some people might not have /boot as a
separate partition, and have it as part of the root filesystem instead,
for instance.  In that case, grub is effectively accessing a dirty
mounted filesystem.  In practice, sync basically takes care of it, but
in theory it shouldn't really be done.

What about the pages that couldn't be loaded back to their final address
because their final address is used by another page that couldn't be
loaded to its final address?  Maybe you have some way to avoid this from
happening, it is just something that occurred to me.  (It isn't
important anyway though.)
I suppose in any case, we can see that resuming would be essentially the
same under the kexec approach as under the current approach.

Well, it is fully functional in the sense that everything works as
advertised.  I don't know exactly how uswsusp works, but the kexec
approach would have the advantage that you don't have to follow any
special rules like:
 - better not write to the mounted filesystems, or you'll corrupt things
 - better not try to talk to any other processes, because they're frozen
   and you'll just hang
 - better not fork any other processes, because only specially listed
   processes get to run (maybe this isn't the case, I don't know).
Essentially, with the current approaches, you end up with two
independent userspaces anyway, but you just try to run them under a
single kernel (and really it would be preferable to have two independent
kernel spaces as well in the case of certain device drivers, but of
course this cannot be done under one kernel, hence the reason for
kexec).

(Perhaps see my comments above.)
Also, perhaps see the reply to Pavel about the need to reserve memory,
which I'm about to write. ;)
Please don't take my comments in this thread too harshly.  I'm not
trying to undermine that work that you and the other hibernate
developers have done.  I just think this kexec approach is an
interesting idea, and I brought it up so that it might get explored.  I
still don't know if it actually makes sense (although I've managed to
mostly convince myself), and discussing it with you and the other
hibernate developers helps in figuring that out.  If I didn't strongly
advocate it, it wouldn't get any thought.
