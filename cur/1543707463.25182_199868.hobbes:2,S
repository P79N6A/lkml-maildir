Yes it can fail, and no, bad things can't happen. We could return the 
error code to user space, but on the other hand, by the time the munmap 
fails we would already have done 90% of the mremap(), so it doesn't much 
help user space to know that the old area still has a vma, but no pages 
associated with it.
