	Weird...   I don't recall any bounces..
	Logs show *one* bounce from  chaos.analogic.com  just
	about an hour ago, and it went to linux-kernel-owner ..
	There are also 121 successfull deliveries in 12 hours
	collected in the log.

	Where then those 121 messages went ?
	The ECN connectivity problem is visible only when
	connection originator (= vger) has the ECN bit on.
	If incoming SYN doesn't have ECN bit on, reply to
	SYN is sent without ECN.   That is why people can
	reach VGER, but VGER might not be able to reach
	people's MTAs.
