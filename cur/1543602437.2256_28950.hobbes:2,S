Argus has responded to me that their kernel patch is released under the
GPL (and will be placing it up on a sf.net site soon.)  However their
security kernel module that their patch uses is closed source.  So add
them to the closed source module list :)
As for the legality of modifying the kernel to provide hooks for your
closed source driver, I'm not going to argue that one, but I thought it
was forbidden.
