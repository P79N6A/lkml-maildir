Yes.

OK, that can happen.  Daniel had a fixlet for that and I assume he's
retrying that.
Not only can it happen with ext3, but also with any random filesystem which
does ll_rw_blk() of a random metadata block.  sync_blockdev() can miss the
associated page.  Conceivably this could leave I/O in flight after umount.
I'm thinking that the right thing to do here is to change submit_bh()
callers and ll_rw_block() to run set_page_writeback(bh->b_page) when they
start the buffer writeout and to do the run-around-the-buffer_heads thing
at I/O completion.  Ho hum, that'll take a bit of work but at least it
kills off some exceptionalities.
