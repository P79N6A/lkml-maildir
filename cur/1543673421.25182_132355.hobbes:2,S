That is a server bug. There are no rules for congestion control
etc. in the NFS or SunRPC protocols, so the server is supposed to be
able to cope with whatever the client manages to throw at it.
I presume, though, that you are not seeing the 2.4.x NFS server die in
this way when you blast it with a 2.5 client?
