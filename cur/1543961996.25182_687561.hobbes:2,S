Well, I think you know how TCP works.  The sender can only send as much
data as the receiver lets it, no matter how much data there are to send.
I'm thinking about an analogous approach.
If the developers who produce those patches know in advance about the rate
limit and are promised to be treated fairly, they should be able to organize
their work in a different way.

That's mostly when they feel that they are treated unfairly.
OTOH, insisting that your patches should be merged at the same rate that you're
able to develop them is unreasonable to me.
