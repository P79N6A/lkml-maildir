Hello,
I'm trying to have suspend to disk and suspend to RAM work on my machine
(Dell Inspiron 6400, 2Go RAM, with an Intel Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GM
L Express Integrated Graphics Controller.
To suspend, I'm using the "echo mem | disk > /sys/power/state" command.
As of now, using suspend to RAM allow the machine to suspend, and resume is
nearly OK except the video is not restored, and the screen stays black (but
keyboard is Ok, I can launch any command I want, so I can restart).
When suspending to disk, suspend is Ok with :
echo -n 2097152000 > /sys/power/image_size ;
echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
and resuming detects the image in the swap partition. So, I have on the
console, when I add "no_console_suspend" on the boot command line :
PM: loading image data pages...
PM: read xxxxx kbytes in y.zz seconds
...
[stuff about scsi/sda]
Disabling non-boot CPUs
CPU1 is now offlone
SMP alternatives: switching to UP code
CPU1 is down
and then, nothing :( machine is dead frozen. CAPS Lock doesn't toggle the
keyboard LED anymore, I need to manually power off and power on the machine.
I must add that these are my first attempts. So, this is not to be
considered a regression.
Is there anything else I can do to try to debug the resume ?
Regards,
Paul
