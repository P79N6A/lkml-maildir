2.2.13ac2 changes
-	Pull the PIII support. Too many problems. It may be back soon as
	HJ Lu and I have identified most of them and Doug fixed some already
-	IPVS updated to 0.9.2-2
Features added that probably won't be going into 2.2. proper
o	RAW I/O
o	IP Virtual Server (load balancing across servers)
o	RAID 0.90
Features added which will go into 2.2 if they prove ok in 2.2.13ac
o	Cross platform fixes for the audio code
o	Alpha platform updates that didnt quite make 2.2.13
o	Multi APIC support
o	Hash table sizing by system memory size
o	PCI ID updates
o	PCnet/PCI updates - IBM card support, FIFO handling, go faster
	stripes
o	KNFSD 0.4.7
Stuff Im considering if this one goes OK.
