Hi, 
On my laptop which is not SMP , is a Intel Centrino 1.7Mhz , I have a
little stranger problem my lid button (backlight) doesn't work with
_DOS=0 after load Hal service and on first boot. 
Like _DOS=0 on some laptop crash on lid close. 
The report #6001 , made by other Sérgio (not me), which complains on
system freeze when _DOS=1 and on switching display. 
Switching display for him means on switching to CTR or to monitor with
fn+ f4. With acpi=off don't freeze because that have the event , and
with acpi on, freeze , so IMHO, this is a problem probably not related
with _DOS value, Sérgio Luis , in last comment
( 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6001#c51
 ) wrote with
updated kernel freeze in the 2 cases. 
But this report introduce a patch in main kernel that change _DOS from 1
to 0 , which I think at least should be reverted.
I'd love learn more about this switches , if someone can help me with
some tip , many thanks,
