i triggered it via two IO-intense scripts running on a 256 MB RAM
testbox:
  cd /tmp; while true; do dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=1000000 
  count=500 >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; sync; date; sleep 60; done &
  while true; do du /usr >/dev/null 2>/dev/null; date; done &
usually it triggers within half an hour or so of runtime. With -R4 it
didnt crash yet after ~1 hour of running so i'm quite optimistic that 
this particular bug has been fixed.
i think the key to reproduce was to use KP=0,SP=0,HP=0 - this
concentrates all preemption activity to the places the VP patch adds -
amongst them the one in the do_exit() path that is necessary to trigger
the race.
