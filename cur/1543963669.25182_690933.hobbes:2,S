Dear all,
I am trying to perform some benchmarks that involve reading the same big
file a couple of times from disk. However I would want to make sure that
the file is not buffered/cached by the kernel when I read the file a
second/third/etc time.
Is there a way (except rebooting/unmounting the disk) to clear the
buffers?
Thanks,
Soeren
