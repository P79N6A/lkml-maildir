I came across this some time earlier.

In a nutshell:
  With an mtu of 9000, ping up to a size of 8968(8996) bytes to
  another host in the same subnet works, until a ping of larger
  size (but smaller than the 8972 bytes allowed by an mtu of
  9000) causes the pmtu to drop to 8166.  With several pings
  the pmtu can drop all the way down to 1492.
I tried it on my system and got the same behaviour on a Redhat 9 box
running vanilla kernel 2.6.5.  With a 2.4.22 kernel from Fedora Core 1,
the same box does not show this problem.
This is not limited to jumbo frames, an mtu of 1496 (but not 1500) shows
similar behavior, with pings larger than 1464(1492) bytes failing.
Is this a configuration problem or a bug?
Below is the log from 2.6.5.  I've also attached the kernel
configuration used.
