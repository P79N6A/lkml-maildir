It isn't clear that -1 is safe either. One thing I would suggest for
your latest weird embedded beastie is that you tweak the IRQ assignment
so IRQ 0 disappears or becomes IRQ 63 or something. IDE does have this
problem, but so does USB and a lot of other code.
Basically we need a "NOT_AN_IRQ" value defined either globally or per
port
