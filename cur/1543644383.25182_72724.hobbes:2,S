If you can't fit a whole tree including metadata into RAM, though, BK 
crawls...   Going from "bk citool" at the command line to actually 
seeing the citool window approaches five minutes of runtime, on this 
200MB laptop...  [my dual athlon with 512MB RAM corroborates your 
numbers, though]  "bk -r co -Sq" takes a similar amount of time...
I also find that BK brings out the worst in the 2.4 kernel 
elevator/VM...  mouse clicks in Mozilla take upwards of 10 seconds to 
respond, when "bk -r co -Sq" is running on this laptop [any other 
read-from-disk process behaves similarly].  And running any two BK jobs 
at the same time is a huge mistake.  Two "bk -r co -Sq" runs easily take 
four or more times longer than a single run.  Ditto for consistency 
checks, or any other disk-intensive activity BK indulges in.
Next time I get super-annoyed at BK on this laptop, I'm gonna look into 
beating the disk scheduler into submission...  some starvation is 
clearly occurring.
