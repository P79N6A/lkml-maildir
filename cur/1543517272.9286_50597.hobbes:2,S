Subject: [PATH] A few things for immediate cleanup.

The attached patch contains a few things which can be immediately
cleaned up.
It's in esp. removing two pseudo compiler problem workarounds by using
bogous macro constructs (Which are possible reminiscents for older gcc
usage).
Second I have noticed that the usuefullness of the
get_hardblocksize function is, lets say, at least
questionable. The simple logics is that:
1. Why do get all the other file systems around
without using it?
2. At least raid and frieds basically just don't care about it if I
understand
the code correctly.
Let's have a precise look at it again:
./fs/buffer.c:588:unsigned int get_hardblocksize(kdev_t dev)
./fs/isofs/inode.c:547: 	blocksize = get_hardblocksize(dev);
./fs/ext2/super.c:393:	blocksize = get_hardblocksize(dev);
./fs/ext2/super.c:471:		hblock = get_hardblocksize(dev);
./fs/udf/lowlevel.c:97:	unsigned int hbsize = get_hardblocksize(dev);
./fs/udf/super.c:399:	sb->s_blocksize = get_hardblocksize(sb->s_dev);
./kernel/ksyms.c:172:EXPORT_SYMBOL(get_hardblocksize);
./include/linux/fs.h:937:extern unsigned int get_hardblocksize(kdev_t);
There I see it and I'm seriously starting to scratch my head....
Removing this would make at least the quite offending two dimensional
hardsect_size array almost a "write only" variable, which could be used
for
a significant overall device handling cleanup. 
I have anyway the impression that all device drivers are emulating
nearly
arbitrary physical block sizes, just due to the fact that:
1. Alomst anything is using powers of two as the base for block sizes.
2. 512 is the lowest common denominator for all filesystems those days.
(We don't support CP/M filesystems as far as I'm aware of ;-).
3. Anything above 512 can be easly handled on the device level due to 1.
by
coalescing accesses to bigger block sizes into multiple smaller ones.
(See the block strategy routine of every single block device driver for
refference...)
However there I have just added a comment without actually changing any
code,
becouse I would like to hear first if I'm missing some important
point...
Let's have a tighter look at it...
./fs/buffer.c:594:	if (hardsect_size[MAJOR(dev)] != NULL) {
./fs/buffer.c:595:		int blksize = hardsect_size[MAJOR(dev)][MINOR(dev)];
^^^ Seems to be the only legitimative use of it. However apparently I
think
one can get easly without it, becouse this is anyway our
get_hardblocksize...
./fs/fat/inode.c:455:	if (hardsect_size[MAJOR(sb->s_dev)] != NULL){
./fs/fat/inode.c:456:		blksize =
hardsect_size[MAJOR(sb->s_dev)][MINOR(sb->s_dev)];
^^^ This appears to be just a consistency check and for me the logics
behind it doesn't cut it.
./fs/partitions/amiga.c:47:	blocksize = get_hardsect_size(dev);
./fs/partitions/check.c:164:int get_hardsect_size(kdev_t dev)
./fs/partitions/check.c:166:	if (hardsect_size[MAJOR(dev)] != NULL)
./fs/partitions/check.c:167:		return
hardsect_size[MAJOR(dev)][MINOR(dev)];
^^^ I don't care much about the amiga and I think they are missing some
point
anyway here.
./fs/partitions/msdos.c:80:	int sector_size = get_hardsect_size(dev) /
512;
./fs/partitions/msdos.c:329:	int sector_size = get_hardsect_size(dev) /
512;
./drivers/block/blkpg.c:261:			intval = get_hardsect_size(dev);
^^^^^^ Hugh? Why not just simple use the logical block size (PAGE_SIZE)
here?
./drivers/char/raw.c:178:		if (hardsect_size[MAJOR(bdev)])
./drivers/char/raw.c:179:			sector_size =
hardsect_size[MAJOR(bdev)][MINOR(bdev)];
^^^ This is as dubious the same way as the usage inside the fat code and
apparently
once again just a statement about the implementation of this facility.
At all other places this array get's only used as a "write only"
variable.
So I have the impression that hardsect_size is just an artefact from the
past where
it wasn't entierly clear who should handle blocksize differences between
actual
physical blocks on the disk and blocksizes expected by a particular
filesystems.
Should it be the filesystem layer or the block device layer.
I'm pretty convinced this got already resolved the natural way by the
actual
drivers for the devices in favour of the device level ;-).
Thank's in advance for any comment's/corrections.
Anyway I think I have just identifyed a serious problem in the above.
