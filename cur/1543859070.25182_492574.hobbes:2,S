i have no problem knocking out of the parser anything related to
"depends" or "requires."  in fact, i did note in earlier patch
submissions that i was just cleaning the Kconfig files but i was
leaving the parser alone, and someone else was welcome to take care of
that.
if the kbuild folks are good with this, i certainly have no objection.

p.s.  i didn't look closely enough to see if your patch took out
support for both "depends" *and* "requires".  at this point, neither
of those are necessary anymore -- it's all "depends on" except for
three remaining Kconfig files.
