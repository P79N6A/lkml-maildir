That seems pretty crude. There are lots of cases where an apparently
removable device is/should be preserved properly and left mounted (eg
builtin CF).
We really want to be smarter than that - which means the drivers ought to
be doing stuff in their suspend/resume paths to figure out if the media
changed when really possible (eg IDE removable)
Floppy is probably not too fixable, but calling it a "user error" is
insulting - user expectation is reasonable that suspend/resume should
just work. The implementation is just rather trickier/nonsensical in this
case.
