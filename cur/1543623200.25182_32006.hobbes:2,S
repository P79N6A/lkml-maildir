Subject: [PATCH] Small fix for AGP Config.in
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/3/3/72

Support for agp in chipsets i820 and i830mp was added to 2.4.18, but
drivers/char/Config.in was not updated. This patch fixes that. It was
made against 2.4.18.
This patch is also available from:
http://digilander.iol.it/webvenza/kernel_patches.html
There is no maintainer for AGP in MAINTAINERS file, so I send it directly to
you, Marcelo.
Bye.
