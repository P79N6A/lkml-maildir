Is this sufficient to do driver development?  TUN/TAP doesn't let me write 
ethernet drivers inside UML.

This is a matter of fiddling the config process.  It might not be easy, but 
there isn't much doubt that it's possible :-)

First, have a look at the USB patch at 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/p
atches/uml-hcd-2.4.3.patch
My ALS paper has a description of how UML basically works inside and it's not 
too much out of date - 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/als2000/index.htm

Also, my ALS and LCA slides have this sort of information -
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/slides/als2000/slides.html
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/slides/lca2001/lca.html
The LCA slides are probably better.  They are from a few months later, and I 
had a longer slot, so I needed more slides.
If you have questions which aren't answered on my site, send me mail.
