I won't be able to check until later today. With the tracing patch
added (for figuring out the warning at boot time), my kernel is about
50-60K too large to fit on a 1.6MB floppy. I first need to see if I
can trim or modularize some fat from my kernel without affecting the
reproducibility of these bugs... (If all else fails, I'll probably add
a CD-RW drive to this box and boot kernels from that.)
