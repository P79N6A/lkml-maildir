I didn't find the post you're talking about, but after reading 2.6.9
de_thread function, I didn't find major diff with previous release. 
So I suppose that the leak is always present, and I have some details..
I wrote a new test case that works with 2.6.x kernel. I have run it on a
Fedora Core 2 node with a 2.6.8-1.521 kernel and also with the new 2.6.9
kernel, and it has also produce a leak in siqueue buffers. It can be
seen by looking at sigqueue cache info in /proc/slabinfo.
It seems that the bug is due to the call to
init_sigpending(&current->pending) at line 737 of de_thread. 
It breaks the actual sigqueue pending list and all the linked entries
are lost. As a consequence, current->user->pending count is also not
updated.
Here is the new test case. Of course you have to compile it with
-lpthread flag.
/*
 * This small program generate a memory leak of signal info structure.
 *
 * The first time the test program is executed, it will send about 1024
 * signal depending of RLIMIT_SIGPENDING value (default is 1024).
 * Then it will exec itself and try to send signal again. That will
failed.
 *
 * After that, you will not be able to run it again since
user->sigpending
 * has raised the maximum value. But there is no active task with
pending
 * signals !!!
 *
 * You can also see in /proc/slabinfo that sigqueue pool was increase by
1024.
 * Theses siqueue entries are lost and user can't send signal with
signal info
 * anymore.
 *
 * WARNING : You have to reboot the node to restore sigqueue entries.
