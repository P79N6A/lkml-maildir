Hi Andrew,
I have another question. You included an oom_adj entry in /proc for
each process. This was the approach you used in order to allow someone
or something to interfere the ranking algorithm from userland, right?
So if i have an another ranking algorithm in user space, I can use it
to complement the kernel decision as necessary. Was it your idea?
BR,
Mauricio Lin.
