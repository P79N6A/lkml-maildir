I agree with you Michael.  This would make it possible to write
applications which are robust about memory allocation, since they will
know at malloc time whether they have the memory they requested and can do
intelligent things (e.g., purge buffers, alert the user, wait, etc.)
beyond merely catching SIGTERM and exiting gracefully.
Overcommitting memory is the moral equivalent of writing bad checks and 
praying there will be money to cover them before they are cashed.  It's
completely irresponsible-- and when it fails, it really bites down hard.

I know I'm going to get pelted with rotten tomatoes for saying so, but
if you're talking about fork+exec, vfork() was an obscenity but it did
handle the trivial case quite well.

No, I think you're spot-on.
