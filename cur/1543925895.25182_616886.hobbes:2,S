Subject: [RFC 0/7] LTTng Kernel Instrumentation (Architecture Independent)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/13/305

Hi,
I submit this instrumentation of the main kernel events using markers to the
Linux community as an RFC. This is the instrumentation LTTng (Linux Trace
Toolkit Next Generation, at 
http://ltt.polymtl.ca
) uses.
In addition to this, I also have architecture dependent instrumentation for:
- traps
- system call entry/exit
- kernel thread creation
- IPC call
which I plan to submit a bit later, once these architecture independent core
instrumentation patches will have been discussed.
The goal here is be be able to tell "what the kernel is doing" so we can :
- get execution traces from bug reporters easily.
- help userspace developers to understand the interactions of their programs
  with other processes and with the kernel.
Mathieu
