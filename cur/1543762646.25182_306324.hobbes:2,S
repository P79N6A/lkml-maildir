The first implementation would probably just be the setting of a "pending
owner" bit. But the better one may be to unschedule. But, what would the
overhead be for unscheduling. Since you need to grab the run queue locks
for that. This might make for an interesting case study. The waking up of
a process who had the lock stolen may not happen that much.  The lock
stealing, would (as I see in my runs) happen quite a bit though. But on
UP, the waking of the robbed owner, would never happen, unless it also
owned a lock that a higher priority process wanted.
