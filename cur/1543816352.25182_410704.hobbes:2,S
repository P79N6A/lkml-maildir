Yeah, it turns out that the debug option is not compatible with hugetlb
page support. That debug option turns off PSE. Once it is turned off in
CR4, cpu will ignore pse bit in the pmd and causing infinite page-not-
present fault :-(
void __init early_cpu_init(void)
{ ...
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
        /* pse is not compatible with on-the-fly unmapping,
         * disable it even if the cpus claim to support it.
         */
        clear_bit(X86_FEATURE_PSE, boot_cpu_data.x86_capability);
        disable_pse = 1;
#endif
[patch] mark DEBUG_PAGEALLOC to be mutually exclusive option with
        HUGETLBFS.  Bug found by Mark Rustad.
