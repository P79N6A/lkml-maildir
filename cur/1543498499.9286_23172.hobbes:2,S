I'm looking into building a kernel to have big numbers of PPP devices,
up to 1000 or so.
net/core/dev.c seemed particularly ugly in this regard.
The following is a suggested patch.  It has a caveat of not guaranteeing 
continuous device numbers above 64 (eg, multiple devices allocating above
64, a module being removed and re-inserted or a module which doesn't hang
on to allocated names), but the advantage of not being so inefficient or just 
giving up.  I don't see that continuous device numbers are needed, they're
nice while they're easy to allocate (low numbers) but once the numbers get
big, they become a problem.
Another alternative would be to add a third argument, "hint", to 
dev_alloc_name and then get dev_alloc_name to scan 100 positions starting at 
"hint" (then get the driver to send an appropriate hint).  This would 
potentially be even more efficient, but need a change to all net drivers.
Third alternative (my preference now I think about it): add a
dev_alloc_name_hint, make dev_alloc_name a #define with a hint of 0.
Comments?
David.
