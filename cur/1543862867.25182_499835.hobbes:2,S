Is there any chance that someone could implement this (I don't have the 
skills, unfortunately)? Maybe add a new ioctl() to block devices, so that it 
doesn't break any existing code?
I believe it's a very useful (and relatively simple) feature that increases 
data integrity and reliability for applications that need this functionality.
I think it must be considered that most people have disk write caches enabled 
and are using IDE, SATA or SCSI disks.
I also think there's no point in disabling disks' write caches, since it slows 
writes and decreases disks' lifetime, and because there's a better solution.
Personally, I'm not really interested in specific filesystem behaviour, since 
my application uses block devices directly (it's a filesystem itself). 
Although I think all filesystems should guarantee data integrity in the face 
of fsync() or metadata modifications, even if it costs a little performance.
Thank you.
