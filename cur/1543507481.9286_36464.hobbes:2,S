The US Government, in its wisdom, has decreed that crypto hooks aren't allowed 
to be exported either.
Presumably that's because without the hooks, we foreigners aren't even clever
enough to link in the existing crypto we've already smuggled from the US, so
that rule will stop us from using crypto just as effectively.
However, I believe you're allowed to export hooks if they're for compression.
Apparently we're not clever enough to plug crypto modules into compression
hooks either :)
N.B. This is sarcasm. That's one thing we _are_ capable of.
