OK, I used a WARN_ON mainly because ext3 has been doing this for years
without killing anyone until now :)
[BLOCK] bh: Ensure bh fits within a page
There is a bug in jbd with slab debugging enabled where it was submitting
a bh obtained via jbd_rep_kmalloc which crossed a page boundary.  A lot
of time was spent on tracking this down because the symptoms were far off
from where the problem was.
This patch adds a sanity check to submit_bh so we can immediately spot
anyone doing similar things in future.
