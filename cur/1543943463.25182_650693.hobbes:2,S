Subject: [RFC][PATCH 28/30] r/o bind mounts: track numbers of writers to mounts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/509

This is the real meat of the entire series.  It actually
implements the tracking of the number of writers to a mount.
However, it causes scalability problems because there can be
hundreds of cpus doing open()/close() on files on the same mnt at
the same time.  Even an atomic_t in the mnt has massive scalaing
problems because the cacheline gets so terribly contended.
This uses a statically-allocated percpu variable.  All want/drop
operations are local to a cpu as long that cpu operates on the same
mount, and there are no writer count imbalances.  Writer count
imbalances happen when a write is taken on one cpu, and released
on another, like when an open/close pair is performed on two
Upon a remount,ro request, all of the data from the percpu
variables is collected (expensive, but very rare) and we determine
if there are any outstanding writers to the mount.
I've written a little benchmark to sit in a loop for a couple of
seconds in several cpus in parallel doing open/write/close loops.
http://sr71.net/~dave/linux/openbench.c
The code in here is a a worst-possible case for this patch.  It
does opens on a _pair_ of files in two different mounts in parallel.
This should cause my code to lose its "operate on the same mount"
optimization completely.  This worst-case scenario causes a 3%
degredation in the benchmark.
I could probably get rid of even this 3%, but it would be more
complex than what I have here, and I think this is getting into
acceptable territory.  In practice, I expect writing more than 3
bytes to a file, as well as disk I/O to mask any effects that this
has.
(To get rid of that 3%, we could have an #defined number of mounts
in the percpu variable.  So, instead of a CPU getting operate only
on percpu data when it accesses only one mount, it could stay on
percpu data when it only accesses N or fewer mounts.)
