of course.
2.4 systems that are already using XFS as a patch probably would have a benefit
to see it integrated into 2.4 kernel, but they would is it anyway as a patch.
I do not think the merge would be usefull thinking to a from2.4/to2.6 upgrade.
In fact, if a system is not using XFS already, it is difficoult
that a filesystem is changed if it is an upgrade and not a reinstallation.
So, at the end, to have XFS just as a patch for 2.4 is not so bad.
