The short translation of my message for you is "Linus, please don't
LART me too hard."

This sort of concern is too subjective for me to have an opinion on it.
My preferred sphere of operation is the Manichean domain of faster vs.
slower, functionality vs. non-functionality, and the like. For me, such
design concerns are like the need for a kernel to format pagetables so
the x86 MMU decodes what was intended, or for a compiler to emit valid
assembly instructions, or for a programmer to write C the compiler
won't reject with parse errors. If Linus, akpm, et al object to the
design, then invalid output was produced. Please refer to Linus, akpm,
et al for these sorts of design concerns.
