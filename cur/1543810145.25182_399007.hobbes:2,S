I have some questions then.
1. Are Patrick's acpi driver model changes considered to be a more
final approach that standardize everyone to some sysfs based interface
to userspace?
1a. Can I assume there is consensus among the acpi community around
his new model?
2. Is his driver model going to maintain compatibility with the older
existing /proc model and those userspace apps that already use that
interface?
3. Is his driver model going to also maintain compatibility with your
newer model (assuming that his model is different than yours).

Ok. I wish I'd known before. I scanned the mailing list before
mbarking on this to see if any issues were raised with toshiba and
asus driver code and didn't see anything. FWIW, my powers of mind
reading only work on Fridays. :-)

Oh. I don't disagree with that.
