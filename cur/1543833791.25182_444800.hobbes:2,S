	make-kpkg uses version.h to get UTS_RELEASE.  UTS_RELEASE has
moved to utsrelease.h.
Right after you get the error, modify
debian/ruleset/misc/version_vars.mk 
-UTS_RELEASE_VERSION=$(shell if [ -f include/linux/version.h ]; then	 \
-                 grep 'define UTS_RELEASE' include/linux/version.h | \
+UTS_RELEASE_VERSION=$(shell if [ -f include/linux/utsrelease.h ]; then	 \
+                 grep 'define UTS_RELEASE' include/linux/utsrelease.h | \
And rerun your make-kpkg.  The above is not a valid patch, you'll have
to hand change it.
