Fwiw, the WM8350 and the MC13783 also have similar global states for ON
and STANDBY/HIBERNATE. I would imagine PMICs from other vendors would
have similar global states too.

Yes I think it would be worthwhile adding this sort of functionality. I
had considered this earlier on in development but it was lower priority
for me then.
This would mean some additions to the regulator machine interface (to be
used during machine regulator setup) and regulator driver interface (to
set the values). I could add some 'standby_uV' and 'standby_mode' fields
(one for each standby state) to struct regulation_constraints. This
would define the desired voltage and regulator operating mode to be used
during the regulators STANDBY/HIBERNATE states. Hence the correct
regulator output state would be selected when the PMIC enters it's
STANDBY/HIBERNATE state (via either a I2C write or hardware signal). 
Would this suffice for your PMIC (sorry I don't have the datasheet) ?

Entering the PMICs global STANDBY/HIBERNATE state usually either comes
from the hardware (e.g. button press, low battery, over temp) or a
software user request. The constraints would be set at machine init time
(along with the runtime constraints). This would work well for WM8350,
but I'm not sure for PCF506xx. 
However, entering individual regulator STANDBY/HIBERNATE states can be
more difficult and as it is quite tightly coupled to the machine (and
it's current use case or use case transition). Do you need per regulator
STANDBY/HIBERNATE control ? We already have the ability to change the
operating mode on a per regulator basis but not switch to states other
than ON and OFF.

No problem, I'll add this too. I'll try and do this tomorrow (and also
the MAINTAINERS patch) and send for review.
