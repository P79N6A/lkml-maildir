Pulled into tip/core/percpu, thanks Tejun.
Very nice stuff! The SMP TLB flush code unification is a gem - i never 
thought we'd get so far this quick ;-)
Note, i also merged the latest cpumask work into tip/core/percpu, to 
resolve tlb_32.c conflicts. I also moved tlb.c from arch/x86/kernel/ to 
arch/x86/mm/, where it really belongs conceptually.
-tip testing also stumbled upon a build error caused by the UV cleanups - 
see the fix below.

Subject: [PATCH] x86: uv cleanup, build fix
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Fix:
 arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c: In function ‘acpi_numa_processor_affinity_init’:
 arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c:141: error: implicit declaration of function ‘get_uv_system_type’
 arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c:141: error: ‘UV_X2APIC’ undeclared (first use in this function)
 arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c:141: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
 arch/x86/mm/srat_64.c:141: error: for each function it appears in.)
A couple of UV definitions were moved to asm/uv/uv.h, but srat_64.c did
not include that header. Add it.
