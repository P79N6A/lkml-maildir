 I agree. My idea was to place those routines in utils.o and then
 modify callers, like udftime.c and ips.c to use them. What is currently
 in utils.c has been gathered from files that were known to me,
 lice rtctime.c in the arm arch and some rtc drivers. Once deployed,
 it will be easier to find and convert similar routines.y
