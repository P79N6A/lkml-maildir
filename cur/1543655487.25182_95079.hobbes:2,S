Oh, I didn't mean each sub-chip driver, I meant the "southbridge driver".
Right now that's really only the PIRQ table mini-driver (all ten lines of
it ;)
Sadly, we do _not_ have a really good generic model for setting interrupt
lines. The PIRQ stuff comes closest to a driver model, but it gets
disabled by the MP table parsing, and then we don't have anything good to
fall back on, I'm afraid.
