I've been getting the "redefinition warnings" during the compile and
for the most part I've ignored them. But today I went to compile a
module and received a file not found error. In <linux/module.h>
it needs <linux/version.h> and on my system it's not there. Have I done
something wrong? Others running 2.2.1 have been able to compile the
module. It's the Lirc for 2.1.x and above.
