Between that atomic_read(&inode->i_count) and the
atomic_dec_and_lock(&inode->i_count, &inode_lock)) in iput someone could
have grabbed a reference.

drop_inode is not going to die, we need it to support filesystems that
want to call generic_delete_inode even for a non-null i_nlink.  What's
hopefully going to die is the last instance of it that isn't either
generic_drop_inode or generic_delete_inode.

In fact I know from some cluster filesystem folks that have a similar
problems as yours.  So getting the truncate_inode_pages under control
of the filesystems sounds like a very good choice.
