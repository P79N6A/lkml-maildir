Maybe next week. I'm away over the weekend and I need it working now ;-).

The following sequence is reproducible:

I suspect this is interference from software on the machine as it does
show an onscreen display when I change the values in sysfs and the
values on the OSD don't match what's really going on.  The
actual_brightness does match the screen.
I guess this just means we need to get userspace to agree on one method
of access for this kind of thing. It makes me wondering where the
hardware brightness keys fit into things though...

No change if unloaded.
