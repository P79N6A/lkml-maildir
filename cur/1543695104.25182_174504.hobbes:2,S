Yes, sleeping within a spinlock is bad practice because it may 
eventually deadlock.  Pretend that the lock is taken, the call to 
kmalloc is made, the mm system doesn't have any immidiately free memory 
and through some flow of execution requires that a some pseudo-block 
device backed filesystem needs to be mounted -> deadlock.  I have no 
idea if this is currently a likely scenario, however not sleeping within 
a lock is 'The Right Thing' and should be avoided at all costs. 
GFP_ATOMIC should be avoided in most circumstances, particularly in 
environments where the code can be refactored to allow for the sleep.  
It is less likely to find free memory atomically and is thus more likely 
to fail.

Ingo's patch simply moved the allocation outside the spinlock..  See my 
later patch about moving the allocation to and __init section, which is 
probably the cleaner thing to do and doesn't require grabbing the page 
and using it conditionally.
As for the mb(), I *thought* that a spinlock implied a memory barrier, 
however I think he put it there because it solves the age-old badness of 
double-checked locking (search google for good explanations of the badness).
