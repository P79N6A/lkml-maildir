Yhat's when the bug was introduced -- 2.6.19. 2.6.18 does not have
this bug, so it cannot be years old.

You're not being rude, but I just wanted to point out that this patch
(nor the dirty page accounting also in 2.6.19) doesn't fix anything
that was in 2.6.18, AFAIKS.
I wouldn't discount a kernel bug, but it will be hard to track down
unless you can find an earlier kernel that did not cause the corruptions
and/or provide source for a minimal test case to reproduce.
