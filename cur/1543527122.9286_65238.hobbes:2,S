1.1ms to 1.2ms using your rtc_latency test.

Its kind of hacked up right now, current kernel is 2.2.14 + 2.2.14aa7
patch + lowlatency-2.2.14-B1 patch + ikd patch.  I have not tried the
changes on a bare 2.2.14 and I would recommend 2.2.14aa7 as a baseline.
I was hoping to get more feedback before posting, also I like to
defer to Ingo for official post.
