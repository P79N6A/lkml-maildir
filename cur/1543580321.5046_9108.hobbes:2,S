When shutting down my computer with Linux, I cannot wake it up using
wake-on-LAN, which I can do if I shut it down from WinME or the LILO
prompt using the power button.
I see some "interesting" code in 3c59x.c and acpi_set_WOL, and there is
the following little comment: "AKPM: This kills the 905".
So, what's up?  Does it break all 905s?  And will not changing the state
to D3, as a comment a few lines down says, shut the card down, which seems
to be a bad thing to do in a function called from vortex_probe1...  I know
this code is currently bypassed, but still, what is this?
