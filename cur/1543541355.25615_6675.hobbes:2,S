I'll second that. It would allow a gradual conversion too, rather than 
breaking all drivers in one fell swoop.
From include/linux/mtd/map.h:
        __u32 (*read32)(struct map_info *, unsigned long);  
        /* If it returned a 'long' I'd call it readl.
         * It doesn't.
         * I won't.
         * dwmw2 */
