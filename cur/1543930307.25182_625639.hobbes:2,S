I don't think that this is a regression: I reported on RedHat bugzilla
when I switched from F7 to F8 and I was using 2.6.23.8 at that time.
It looks to me an HAL regression, but of course I may be wrong :-) as
the reported bisected to a bad commit.

By the way, I now switched to Fedrora Rawhide with a 2.6.24-rc4-git5
custom kernel and Gnome desktop and the problem is still present, even
with gnome-power-manager.
Hope this helps.
