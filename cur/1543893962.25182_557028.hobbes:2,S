I've been following this discussion and I find this interesting.
Consider these two cases:
1.) I ship the device back to the manufacturer, they replace the ROM,
    and ship it back to me.
2.) I ship the device back to the manufacturer, they load new code
    into it, and ship it back to me.
How do these two differ?  Or is it now just a question of the ROM
being in a socket?  I can't see how the technicalities of how the
hardware is constructed can change the legality of the software.
