I saw comments in one of the PCI IDE driver pcidev->suspend routines 
that say "we don't need to iterate over the list of drives, sysfs does 
that for us."

We're talking past each other. I'm saying you take into consideration 
the physical bus hierarchy: PCI bus x is a parent of SCSI bus y which is 
a parent of SCSI disk drive z. Suspend disk z, with involvement from the 
block layer and scsi midlayer, before even calling the actual 
pcidev->suspend routine on the SCSI bus adapter. Shouldn't require more 
than minimal LLD involvement.

In the case of IDE, IDE is registered as a bus_type and has generic 
suspend code for the whole bus that is unrelated to the pcidev. The PIIX 
IDE (Intel chipsets) PCI pcidev struct doesn't even have suspend and 
resume callbacks filled in, but it works fine!
