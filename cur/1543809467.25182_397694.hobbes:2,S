It would solve the problem statement given by Ingo in the rationale 
for this kernel patch - cleaning up after a hanging yum. 
If there are any other problems this is intended to solve then they 
should be stated in the rationale.

Great we agree on that then.

I'm not concerned about the application, just about the kernel.

Ok good that's handled. How about long blocking on swapped out pages
in exit?
You would need a SO_LINGER I guess, but implementing that would be 
fairly nasty.
I think the "kill all" approach would be much simpler.
