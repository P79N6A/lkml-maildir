My point though is that the file system semantics have been static for
20 years.  It is time for them to change.  When they change NFS will
break, at least it will if the changes are substantive.  For this
reason, to argue that NFS cannot be broken is to argue that there should
be no semantic innovation for file systems.  That make the argument
invalid in my eyes.  NFS must be broken.
