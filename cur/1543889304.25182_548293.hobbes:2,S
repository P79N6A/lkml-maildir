Whitespace damanged patch, probably due to using format=flowed in your
mailer.  Please get a proper mail client. 8)
Also, please note that ARM and ARM26 are two separate architectures
maintained by two separate people.  Please don't confuse them and
merge patches - it's about the same level of evilness as labelling
PPC and i386 as one architecture and expecting PPC folk to take the
lot.
