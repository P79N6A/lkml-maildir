I was mostly talking about STR... Regarding STD, we have a different
problem and we all know it. The freezer is one somewhat horrible way to
get it working for now, I would prefer something more along the way that
blocks the page cache from writing out new dirty pages though, except
those specifically flagged by the snapshot.
That is, some kind of proper snapshotting facility, as linus was
describing some time ago.
