I agree 100% so far.

I don't agree that we have a trade off, here. (big surprise? :) We are
simply asking the wrong question in the quest to achieve the desired
benefit. We are asking how to deviate from the standard to get better
performance. We should be asking how to change the kernel to get better
performance without changing the standard app interface. Of course, making
the standard (but rather uninspired) app interface work efficiently is a
_lot_ more technically challenging.

Good luck with that. ;)
BTW, I am hypersensitive to this issue because I got bit by Mot V/88 that
had a buggy MIN and TIME implementation. My phone ran flames for about a
month because of my initial decision to match their quirky interface
behavior in my serial card's driver. 
Best regards,
