Thanks for the explanation. (I was off-line for a couple of days so
didn't get to respond earlier) This is closest to the case that I
was concerned about. Perhaps with merging/write-clustering at higher 
levels the number of requests might be less, but that is secondary.  
What was worrying me is that even when the rate of request taking 
is greater than the rate of request freeing, couldn't we have every 
1 out of N incoming tasks picking up a just freed up request, thus 
starving the waiters ? (The rest N-1 incoming tasks might get to
wait their turn, where N:1 is the ratio of request taking to request
freeing)

Yes, especially when the system has sufficient resources to increase
the request queue size, one might as well queue up on the request 
queue, rather than the wait queue, and minimize those context switches.
