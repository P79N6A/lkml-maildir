Is there one of these going around yet?  Here are the features that I
would enjoy, and I believe are kernel space issues:
 - Encryption at the IP level (IPsec?)
 - ext2 is showing its age on larger partitions; my 3 9 gig drives
   take about a half hour to fsck, and up to a minute just to mount.
   My database server will need support for +2gig files by the end
   of the year.  "go to a 64 bit machine" is not reasonable for
   everyone.  8^)
 - GGI
Well I can't think of any more.  I have been quite satisfied all along
really, since 1.0.x.  Keep up the good work.
Thanks,
Mark
