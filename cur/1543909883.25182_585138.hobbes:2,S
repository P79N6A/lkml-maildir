Just wondering -- Kernels like this (or 2.6.16.x, 2.6.21.x as well as
2.6.22.x once 2.6.23 got released) don't get announced on
linux-kernel-announce. Is that on purpose or a misbehavior of scripts
that create the messages for linux-kernel-announce?
If the latter: are those scripts available somewhere?
