I've also noted my posts coming in late and appearing to be out of
order.
I had thought my problem predated my trial of frame buffer, but I could
be mistaken.  I'll try rebuilding, probably this weekend, without that
support and see what happens.  Since I don't play mp3s all that often it
remains to be seen whether I want that more than frame buffer support.
I've grown used to the 132x45 display.
