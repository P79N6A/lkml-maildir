Unfortunately your patch doesn't achieve your goals. vmalloc space on 
PPC32 will be between KERNEL_BASE and ioremap_bot anyway, so 
additional check is mostly useless anyway (it will only call iopa() 
for ioremaps done early during the boot).
Also, even assuming you got the range right and called iopa() for 
vmalloced space, tell me how are you gonna deal with non-physically 
continuous vmalloced buffers in your DMA library?
