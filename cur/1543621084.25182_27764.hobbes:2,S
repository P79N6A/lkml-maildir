   So how do they modify the printf format rules in gcc ?
   
Because they can claim that they are part of the C environment, and
for the most part they are right so their extensions go into gcc's
magic list.
In fact I'd claim their case to be plugging holes in the standards
specified set of printf format strings. :-)
Hey... we could "borrow" one of these printf format strings we
don't have any need for in the kernel and pretend that is for
"dma_addr_t". :-)
