Are you sure you are using 100Mhz memory?  Standard SDRAM simms aren't
stable when going beyond a 75 Mhz bus.  Also double check your jumpers, the
FIC's have alot of differing configurations for memory/CPU timings (for
example one allows you to use 66Mhz memory on a 100Mhz bus CPU).  Also check
for any BIOS updates, I had some stability problems with earlier versions of
the 503+ BIOS.
