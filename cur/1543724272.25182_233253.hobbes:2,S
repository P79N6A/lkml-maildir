Hi.
That patches are available from swsusp.sf.net (look in the 'Test
patches' section at the bottom of the download page for the latest
patches I've released). The .tar.gz's contain everything needed for
suspend, plus other patches that might be helpful to the user. They
should be applied to a vanilla kernel in order. They aren't yet broken
up into separate patches for merging. That will be my task next week.
Regards,
Nigel
