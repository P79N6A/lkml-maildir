OK, I think, we found out WHY it did not function with my trackpoint.
Actually, it was not the trackpoint but the fact, that I had compiled
in SMP-support into the kernel. I removed it and now the trackpoint
utilities work just fine! It's very likely, that this psaux-module
will work with ANY old driver/utility written for 2.4.X-kernels as
long as you follow the steps on the homepage and remove SMP-support!
