It's not the problem here. always between 200 and 400 MB free.
BTW, the system is not swapping when this happens. The scrolling
is very smooth and relatively fast (about 100 lines/s) which is
enough to understand that X eats all the CPU scrolling one line
at a time. I have yet to understand why 'ls|cat' behaves
differently, but fortunately it works and it has already saved
me some useful time.
Cheers,
Willy
