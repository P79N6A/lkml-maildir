Possibly, but LinuxThreads were never really POSIX thread compliant
anyway. Anyhow, the problem isn't really LinuxThreads, it is rather that
the existence of the standalone CLONE_FILES flag allows you to do a lot
of weird inheritance crap with 'posix locks' that the POSIX standards
committees never even had to consider.
The fact remains, though, that steal_locks() is not a solution: it is
inherently broken for several of the most common filesystems that are
out there.
