The problem is that the ->abs tables are accessed in the input core and
in the handlers, too, which means they have to share the lifetime rules
with the input_dev struct itself.
That means we probably have a problem with the drivers deallocating the
keytable, while the device still exists, because there is a reference to
it from say sysfs, and keyboard.c tries to access the keytable because
of an ioctl.
