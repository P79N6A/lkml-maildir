	Hi!
  Since 2.6.0-test6 ther is an annoying problem with my USB memory pen.
First time I insert it, kernel gives it "sdc" (which is O.K.). Next time
kernel gives it "sdd", "sde" and so on. Seems like someone is not releasing
unused SCSI devices.
  I narrowed down this problem to linux-2.6.0-test5-bk14. There are no USB
changes, but are SCSI changes which I don't understand that well to fix my
problem.
  I would appreciate if someone will look at it.
	Thanks,
		Vita Samel
