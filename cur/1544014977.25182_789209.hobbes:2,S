I was not speaking about iptables but ipset which is an iptables extension.
From my memories, you can have addresses stored as bitmaps, where one bit
equals one address. This would lead to less than 100 kB of RAM for your
500k addresses. But I agree that the concept of the LRU cache is interesting.

IIRC, this is also supported in ipset (I just have not looked at it for a
while now).

This is stupid considering that most of them change their IP address every
24 hours, or at most every 7 days. This is just used to show that spam rate
drops, hiding the fact that valid mails drop for similar reasons. For your
own use, you might consider that you'll never receive mails from people
hosted at the same ISP as the bots you block, but doing this on a large
scale or for companies who do their business around e-mail is plain stupid.
I'm on a static IP, but a lot of people I know are not. It would be
unfair to block them from posting to, say, LKML just because the week
before, someone with their address had been sending spam. And no, it
does not help getting the problem solved since the only users annoyed
are not the ones with the faulty installation.
