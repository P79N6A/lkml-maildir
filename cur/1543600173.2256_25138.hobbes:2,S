And did you run 'fbset <anymode>' on first head after secondary head
was registered? You have to... After bootup first head uses all 16MB
for picture. When you load secondary head module, videoram is split
8MB for first head/8MB for second. And because of for correct
checking driver have to scan all your VCs for picture size, and refuse
to load if any resolution is over 8MB, I just decided to put this
task on user - run 'fbset -a -depth 8' after you load secondary head
module. It will shrink '-vyres' values for primary head displays
from their current value to maximum value possible for new memory
configuration.
