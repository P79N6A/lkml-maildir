Hi
Edited lilo.conf so I can boot either kernel-2.6.0-test2
(default) or kernel-2.4.21, using hda1.
lpr a small file, no print. ctrl-alt-del and rebooted using
2.4.21, file printed. Checked the two config files and could
not find any difference in this area.
Printer is a Panasonic dot-matrix running in text mode.
Also using patch bk5.
Thanks,
  Russ
