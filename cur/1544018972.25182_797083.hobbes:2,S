My simple way to deal with this is to:
0) save the mail
1) fix subject and changelog and add my Signed-off-by:
2) apply the patch somehow
3) replace the origianl patch in the (saved) mail
4) git reset --hard (or patch -p1 -R < saved-mail)
5) git am <saved mail>
There must be easier ways to do so I think.
But the above is what my fingers know to do so I do it
routinely.
