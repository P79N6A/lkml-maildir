Subject: Fixes to SYSV file system support (inode.c)

Recently I had to get a data from an old Xenix disk and in the process
it turned out that a support for SYSV FILESYSTEM, although cleaned up
to a great extent from 2.1 kernel times, still has troubles.  It
probably works mostly ok on Intel with this exception that a reported
length of file names will likely be 0 which precludes reading of
anything.  On 64-bit Alpha one is getting not only tons of "unaligned
access" due to some "optimizations" but also, from time to time,
incorrect values.  The later fills with garbage, in every file, 1024
byte blocs starting at offsets 1024 (0x400) and 9216 (0x2400).  Bigger
directories are also not something to write home about. :-)
I would not even try to write on such file system but in all likelihood
such operation would be totally destructive.
Included below is a patch which allowed me to recover correctly all
data from a file system in question (some 150 MB worth).  It is against
linux-2.2.14pre12 but it should be all right (maybe with some fuzz)
for all 2.2 kernels and likely for 2.3 as well.
Despite of that there is still something which does not look right.
The original code for 'coh_read3byte()' reads:
      return (unsigned long)(*(unsigned char *)p) << 16
           | (unsigned long)(*(unsigned short *)(p+1));
Putting aside all other issues what is returned obviously depends
on BIG or LITTLE ENDIAN representation for short and is not the same.
A similar issue with 'coh_write3byte()'.  It is not clear to me what
was **supposed** to be there so I did not try to second guess
BIG ENDIAN fixes.  Alpha happens to be LITTLE ENDIAN.  Comments?
My replacements are not worse from what was there before but
this does not say very much.
In the course of this project I also ported to 2.2 kernels Peter Swain
patches (
http://www.iinet.net.au/~swine/sco_fs
) to extend SYSV support
to its SCO variant including "divvy" subpartitions. I had to do that
or data would be lost. :-) Support for "divvies" is somewhat hacky;
one has to find proper offsets (I just searched through a disk looking
for something which looked like an SCO superblock) and use search
results to mount "divvies" via loop.  Once proper parametes were found
everything works, with a fixed SYSV support, as expected.  I am not
sure what to do with that.  Any interest?
