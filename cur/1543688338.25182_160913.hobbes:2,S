Very interesting..
with the test4 I experiene the same/similar problems on my laptop..
all of sudden yesterday several programs died -> Out of Memory.
I ran
   Xfree
   dhcpcd
   opera 
   several xterms (about 6)
   qmail
   named
first opera was Out of Memory, then died the whole X system with all
xterms and X beeing Out of Memory.
MemTotal:       385600 kB
which should be more than enough!
