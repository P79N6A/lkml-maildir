I have been avoiding adding more but I have not done had a flag
day and killed them all either.
The one bit int bug was a stupid thinko in the new code.
Totally obvious when someone tried it, to use it.
I think I am about ready to provide a sysrq panic interface.
At least for testing that code path it would be good.  And
if we actually have kernel core dumps it might be useful
beyond that.
