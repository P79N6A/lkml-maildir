Dean, 
If you can do me a favor, the way you really want to test this is by
changing MAX_USER_RT_PRIO to 99 and MAX_RT_PRIO to 
(MAX_USER_RT_PRIO+1).  This will make sure that the patch is working.
Your kernel thread should still run at priority 99. 
Check it with:  ps -eo pid,rtprio,comm
And grep for your thread name.
Thanks,
