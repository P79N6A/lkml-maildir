To an extent.
I will tell you the rules I try to follow for 2.2.x
o	Never add an ABI that is not standardised in 2.3.x by Linus
o	If drivers/ioctl interfaces are added to 2.2 first I try to be very
	fussy about them because an ABI is hardest to fix

I certainly don't want it set in stone. All of a sudden I then become some kind
of multi-vendor approval service. That is wrong.

Compatible with yes, but without additional features - I think thats bad. The
Linux Standard Base project is about defining a standard 'Linux' - which might
btw equally be a fully compliant Linux emulation on FreeBSD for all it matters
to application vendors.

Im confused there. Leonard has been submitted DAC960 patches to the standard
kernel first since 1.2. or so.
