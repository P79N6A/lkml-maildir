Attached is my patch (against 2.4.0-test9) to add EFI GUID Partition Table
support to the Linux kernel, specifically for IA-64.  This code is licensed
under the GPL.
To enable support, add CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION=y to your config files.
Special thanks to Andries Brouwer for his assistance in helping me to
understand the kernel block device layer.
Please direct any feedback you have with about code to me.
Thanks,
