At which point, userspace comes in.  Who knows what userspace chooses.

I don't mean to imply it's useful behaviour: only that it seems to
happen by default if you don't do anything special to prevent it, if
you see what I mean.
It does seem useful to have _files_ mounted automagically (using
loopback devices): for example, cd into a .iso file and it would be
nice to see the contents.  At this point, deciding on the preferred
-EBUSY or not behaviour becomes relevant, as does deciding whether the
.iso in this example is viewed using the kernel's isofs code, or using
a userspace helper in the same way as we'd use one to browse a .zip file.
