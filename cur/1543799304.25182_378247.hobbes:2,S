The optimization of sys_times is only possible because the "current" 
task is running and therefore guarantees that the thread will not be 
exiting.
getrusage and k_getrusage can be called onother tasks than the currently 
executing task and in those cases better take the tasklist lock because 
the task may exit while getrusage runs.
See wait_noreap_copyout() in kernel/exit.c and 
arch/mips/kernel/{sysirix,irixsig}.c for uses of getrusage where the 
struct task_struct * != current.
Maybe you can deal with these and insure that getrusage is always called 
for the current process? In that case the struct task_struct * parameter
needs to be dropped from getrusage and k_getrusage.
