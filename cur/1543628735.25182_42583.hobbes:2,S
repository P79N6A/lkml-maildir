Hello, 
In the late 2.4.19-preX-acY the support for the Promise
Ultra100TX2 is broken. This problem was already reported on
lkml and on the German SuSE Linux mailing list. According to
information from that list the problem only affects the
Ultra100TX2, but NOT the Ultra100TX.
The latest -ac kernel I know to work with this controller, is
2.4.19-pre2-ac4. I just tried 2.4.19-pre7-ac2: it
fails. 2.4.19-pre4-ac3 has also been reported to fail:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0203.3/1011.html
At boot time 2.4.19-pre7-ac2 prints these error messages. The
drives ARE conntected using an 80-pin cable:
hde: set_drive_speed_status: status=0xff { Busy }
Warning: Primary channel requires an 80-pin cable for operation.
hde reduced to Ultra33 mode.
[..]

You can find the configuration of the failing kernel at:
http://stosberg.net/tmp/config-2.4.19-pre7-ac2
Currently I'm using 2.4.19-pre5aa1 without problems.
Regards, 
Dennis
