Subject: RFC: Semaphore behavior

I wanted to clarify my understanding of the behavior of semaphores
on the i386 architecture, as I understand it.
1. I grab a semaphore and I am open to accepting signals
   (down_interruptible)
2. I am interrupted by a user process using ctrl-C or some other
   method of signal delivery.
3. After this point, I cannot grab *ANY* semaphore using
   (down_interruptible), since the semaphore implementation checks for
   pending signals and if there are signals pending, it does not
   grant me the semaphore.
So, the only option I have after (2) to use down_interruptible again
is
a. Flush the signal.
b. Handle the signal.
Please cc your replies to me
Is my assessment correct?
Balbir
