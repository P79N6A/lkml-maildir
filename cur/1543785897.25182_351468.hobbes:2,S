Maybe so, but what I'm doing is introducing a slightly better
implementation of what is currently in tree, and attempting to
follow current standards as far as possible. I don't think you
could say that is a bad thing.
Now I don't think anyone would be flat out opposed to 1 - reworking
the atomic.h code to allow some genericity (is that a word?); 2 -
reworking atomic.h code to allow combining of atomic ops, or allowing
interrupt unsafe ops...
Of course, neither is going to be merged unless done tastefully, and
I imagine both would be difficult to get right, with probably a low
cost/benefit ratio.
Thanks,
Nick
