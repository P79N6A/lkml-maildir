I'd rather not see any more pointer dereferences or even branches than
absolutely necessary.  Right now, readX/writeX and inX/outX are usually
inlines, and outX and writeX can be very fast.  So I'd prefer either a
global CONFIG_MMIO option or consistent driver specific options that
explain what the difference between MMIO and port I/O actually is.
