Why would you want to do that when you already have a better kernel
interface available?
The sys_sendto, sys_recvfrom references the sockets by file handle,
something which requires an extra lookup operation to map the file
handle to socket struct.
OTOH sock_sendmsg(), sock_recvmesg() provides exactly the same
functionality, but takes a pointer to the kernel socket structure as
the argument.
