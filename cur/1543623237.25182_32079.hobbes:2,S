I don't think it behaves badly, and I don't see how rmap can help there
except from saving some cpu. The major O(N) complexity when working on
the lwoer zones is in passing over/ignoring the pages in the higher
zones and that's at the page layer so rmap will make no differences
there and the complexity will remain O(N) (where N is the number of
higher-pages).

I'm not scanning the other/unrelated pagetables just now.

yes, this is why rmap isn't making a sensible difference in the heavy
swap case either.

and for that the aging fair scan for the acessed bitflag has a chance to
be better than the unfair accessed bit handling in rmap that can lead to
not evaluating correctly the accessed-virtual-age of the pages.  Also
threating mapped pages in a special manner is beneficial.

Depends, you may have to do similar things to balance rmap in a similar
manner. The point again is "when to start unmapping stuff". Once you
tune right and choose "ok, go ahead and unmap" at the right time, it
basically doesn't matter if you do that by calling swap_out or if you
try to unmap the current page in the lru. Plus swap_out will be fair and
mapped pages automatically will get a longer lifetime than unmapped
pages like plain fs cache, both things sounds like positive.
Plus rmap hurts the common fast paths, i.e. when no heavy swapout is
needed like in most servers out there.
