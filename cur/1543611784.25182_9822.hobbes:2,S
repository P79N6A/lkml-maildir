   I see that the fix for implementation of show_trace_task() is missing from
   the sparc32 tree in 2.4.17-pre1 and 2.4.17-pre2. Dave M has redone my
   quick and dirty patch and placed it in arch/sparc/process.c
   
   Here is the patch to include in 2.4.17-pre3, thanks.
It's in Marcelo's backlog, most likely.
