I've got AIC-7890, too, and had had problems in building a 
working kernel for Alpha.  I managed to overcome the 
trouble by selecting the SCSI debug mode.  That selection
is in the middle of low-level SCSI section.  It does not
appear right below the aic-7xxx selection.
The behavior does not depend on the versions I tried.
I tried 5.1.21 and 5.1.28.  Now, I use 5.1.28.  Enabling the debug-mode
should not have anything to do with the SCSI timeout error.  So,
this must be a bug of the aic7xxx driver.
In my opinion, that SCSI-debug mode selection should appear 
at the top if it is not specific to any one of the SCSI cards.
