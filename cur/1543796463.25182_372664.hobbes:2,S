Subject: How do I remove a patch buried in your *-mm series?

I want to remove the patch in *-mm:
  1) cpuset-change-marker-for-relative-numbering.patch
Unfortunately, it collides with another couple cpuset patches later in
your stack:
  2) cpuset-memory-pressure-meter.patch, cpuset-memory-pressure-meter-gcc-295-fix.patch
How should I do this so I minimize the amount of cussing you do in my
general direction:
  A. Just ask you to nuke patch (1) above; let you edit the mess.
  B. Ask you to nuke both (1) and (2); leave me to resend a (2) that applies.
  C. Send a reversing patch that applies on top of your current *-mm stack.
  D. Some other plan you would prefer.
I have verified that removing all the patches above applies cleanly and
builds, with just a harmless -74 lines offset on one of the remaining
cpuset patches.
  So I recommend B.
Separately I will send a patch to remove the bit of Documentation/cpusets.txt
that described this feature.
Details for the historical record:
  I either need to go one step forward with it (fix a bug so that
  it zeros the marker_pid of the left behind cpuset when attach_task
  moves a task), or I need to go five steps backward, with a different
  approach.  But I have other stuff to do first, so should avoid
  digging this "change-marker-for-relative-numbering" any deeper
  than it is for now.
