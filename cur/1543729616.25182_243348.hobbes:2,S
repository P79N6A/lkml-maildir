Hello all...
Recording this stuff is basically sending some commands to
a device and then keeping a FIFO full until done.
If `cdrecord` doesn't do it, one can hack together something
that works in a day or so,... really good stuff in a week.
Maybe it's time to ......  anyway ..... the device characteristics
should be kept in an ASCII text file so the software doesn't have
to be re-written everytime a new CD recorder becomes available.
Maybe the `cdrecord` author needs some competition. This sounds
like a good beginner's project....
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
