You had mentioned before there is a way to decompile SSDT with 3rd party
(non iasl.exe) asl tools, do you happen to know where to get them? Also
does the usual dsdt override patch (acpi.sf.net) allow you to override
the ssdt or does it only work for the dsdt?

This seems similiar to what I saw with my machine and mentioned in
#2090, when I hit the power button just right, for lack of a better
description, it would dump acpi_ev_dispatch errors, otherwise it
would immediately shut off. It certainly didn't take the usual ~ 4s hold
down time to shut off.
