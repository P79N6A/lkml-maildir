I have already checked it strictly. This "problem" occurs not only on
vfat partitions. You can *not* do uptime() for time!=NULL if you are
not a file owner. So, everything in Linux is correct.
It is not possible to solve your problem without changing SUS, it is
not even a problem...
I made mistake in my first post, because I was too implied by piece of
code that you've quoted.
