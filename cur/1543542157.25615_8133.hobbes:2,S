Well, yes, but my understanding from the comment:
	/*
	 * Temporary solution - in 2.5 this will be done by the lowlevel
	 * driver. Create a bounce buffer if the buffer data points into
	 * high memory - keep the original buffer otherwise.
	 */
was that we were happy with this restriction, and that it would be
removed in 2.5.
If we leave the create_bounce in __make_request (now
elevator_make_request) then
 1/ any driver that wants to dma from high memory needs to provide
    it's own elevator algorithm and
 2/ every make_request_fn has to do the create_bounce for itself.
Neither of these seem sensible from a software maintenance
perspective. 
But, if you really like, I will move create_bounce back into
elevator_request, and also into md_make_request (and probably into
rd_make_request when I submit that patch - rd doesn't need the
elevator algorithm at all) and resubmit.
