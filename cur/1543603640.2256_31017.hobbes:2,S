We have partial promise and hpt support for their softraid in the -ac tree
and the basics pushed into Linus tree. Andre and Promise have sorted out
full access to promise info on this so we should see full promise softraid
support.
The Promise hardware raid (Supertrak100) is also supported in the ac and
Linus trees nowdays but I've never been happy with its price/performance 
personally.
