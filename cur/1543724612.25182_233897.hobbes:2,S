I want to collect data for a graph. For this I need to collect values of a
TCP flow. For this reason, I feel making a change in syslog.conf wont be
sufficient as I dont want the other kernel messages.
I was thinking, if I could add a new option like KERN_INFO, say
KERN_GRAPH, then I could call printk as
printk(KERN_GRAPH "data");
to collect all the required data and KERN_GRAPH would then add all this
data to a seperate file. By kernel defined files, I meant that KERN_INFO
always writes to /var/log/messages etc.
Any suggestions ??
Thanks,
Rahul.
