Right, and I think the solution to this problem is twofold, 1)
application writers should start writing (soft) realtime applications if
they want (soft) realtime behaviour -- there's just no way around that.
And 2), the kernel can help by providing a deadline based scheduler,
which should make the above easier and less likely to mess up the rest
of the system. ie. a deadline scheduled application will not exceed its
allotted budget, unlike a FIFO scheduled app.
