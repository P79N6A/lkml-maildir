With the device tree source you have posted in 2/5, the rapidio node is
a child of the soc bus, and it doesn't have any children of its own.
Therefore it is completely equivalent to _only_ add the soc type
to mpc86xx_of_ids[], as in 
static struct of_device_id mpc86xx_of_ids[] = {
       { .type = "soc", },
       {},
};
Even if you intend to add children to the rapidio node in the future,
I'd think it would be more appropriate to have those scanned by
the rapidio bus driver, not by of_platform.
