Hello,
I have been trying to get a solution to a minor problem but unfortunately i
have not been able to solve it or get some help on it and i am stuck up from
a long time.
Is there any way i can find out that there has been a change in the kernel
routing table in linux ?
In the file rtnetlink.h there is a rtm_flags feild RTM_F_NOTIFY which says
it notifies the user of route change but i have not been able to capture it
when there is a change in the routing table. 
Is this the right approach ??? 
please give some pointers..
with warm regards
Nomit Kalidhar
