In my understanding, why ia64 doesn't use early_param() macro for mem= at el. is that 
it has to use mem= option at efi handling which is called before parse_early_param().
Current ia64's boot path is
 setup_arch()
    -> efi handling -> parse_early_param() -> numa handling -> pgdat/zone init
kernelcore= option is just used at pgdat/zone initialization. (no arch dependent part...)
So I think just adding
==
early_param("kernelcore",cmpdline_parse_kernelcore)
==
to ia64 is ok.....
