Found the bug. If you receive an IrDA frame after you have done irattach,
but before you have done ifconfig irda0 up, then the machine will crash ;-)
Really nice! Kill your Linux machine with your remote control ;-) However,
it will only apply to ac7-ac9, and probably only for IrDA frames, so the
remote control will not work (but your Palm III will).
I have made a small fix that I will ship over to Alan asap.
