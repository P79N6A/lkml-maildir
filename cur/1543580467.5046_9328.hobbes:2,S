Subject: Linuxrc runs with PID 7

This is a followup question to my previous question
"Why isn't init at PID 1."
Previoulsy I was calling init from within linuxrc. 
Linuxrc was a sash script, so the sash script
supposedly had PID 1.  Now I've removed the script and
have a C program for linuxrc.
I'm still not running at PID 1 but at 7.  The linuxrc
program looks like:
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
   printf("PID = %i\n", getpid());
}
When I boot and linuxrc is executed, PID equals 7.
Any ideas as to why this is and how I can run at PID
1?
Thanks,
Paul
