We just got to the bottom of a problem in xfs which was causing memory
not to get cleaned as efficiently as it should be - it lead to dbench
lockups on low memory systems. It is possible you are seeing a similar
effect - we dirty all the memory and then struggle to clean it up.
Try the attached patch.
