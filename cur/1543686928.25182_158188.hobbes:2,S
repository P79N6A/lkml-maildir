nmi_watchdog=2 will work on the majority of i686+ (performance 
counters with NMI delivery mode) boxes and you can check whether it's 
enabled by doing cat /proc/interrupts and watching if the NMI line ticks 
at a decent rate. nmi_watchdog=1 tends to be harder for hardware 
manufacturers to get right (for some reason or other).
