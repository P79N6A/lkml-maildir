Name one such case.
An atomic_read should do a load from memory.  If the programmer puts
an atomic_read() in the code then the compiler should emit a load for
it, not re-use a value returned by a previous atomic_read.  I do not
believe it would ever be useful for the compiler to collapse two
atomic_read statements into a single load.
