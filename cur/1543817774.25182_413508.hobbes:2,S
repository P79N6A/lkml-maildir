That's pre smpnice. :-)

I had thought about substituting (busiest_load_per_task + 
this_load_per_task) for (busiest_load_per_task * 2) but couldn't 
convince myself that it was the right thing to do.  (The final update to 
this_load_per_task would need to be moved.)  The reason I couldn't 
convince myself is that I thought it might be too aggressive and cause 
excessive balancing.  Maybe something more sophisticated is needed to 
prevent that possibility.  It should be noted that the relative sizes of 
busiest_load_per_task and this_load_per_task my be useful in deciding 
what to do in these cases.  I'll put some thought into that.
BTW load balancing without smpnice would do just as badly here in that 
it wouldn't notice an imbalance either.

It does in most cases and we could reduce the complexity if we had an 
alternative trigger for active_load_balance() :-)

Most people who express unhappiness with SMP and nice are looking at the 
other end of the problem i.e. they nice 19 a process to make it run in 
the background but it gets a CPU to itself while a couple nice 0 tasks 
have to share the other CPU.  The high priority case has to be 
considered as well (e.g. one high priority task and one normal priority 
task running on a 2 CPU machine with a CPU each when another task wakes 
-- you'd like that to end up on the CPU of the normal priority task not 
the one with the high priority task, etc.) but its effects are more 
likely to be transitory and high priority tasks would not be expected to 
have a long term effect on balancing.
