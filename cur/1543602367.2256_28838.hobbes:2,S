Would make things more complicated though?
Maybe by default (v)fat permissions should be
a+x  on directories and a-x on files. But then
you can't execute any files on (v)fat partitions,
which is equivalent to the noexec option, so I'm
guessing the noexec option was previously overloaded to
do a-x on files so this would be explicit? Maybe
is would be better to put back the old logic? :-)
