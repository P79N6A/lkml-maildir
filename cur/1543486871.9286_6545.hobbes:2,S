Subject: Limit on number of SYSV shared memory objects in the kernel

Hello all,
My company has an application that relies on creating 100s of SYSV
semaphore arrays to control many processes reading a block of SYSV
shared memory. The default limit on the number of these objects in Linux
seems to be around 100. Is it possible to increase the number of these
objects that are available to the 1000 range (without reducing SHMMAX,
in fact preferably being able to increase SHMMAX to arbitrary size would
be very useful too)? What would it take to be able to allow this?
Thanks for any info,
Fred
