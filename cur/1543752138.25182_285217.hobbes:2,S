True, but this is what I attempted to allude to in the description of the patch:

Since I'm not the author, I'm not certain whether you are right or
not. I was honestly very confused by nicedelay(). It is called with
various 600000, 500000, 200000 usecs, but the function currently
always requests a 1000000 usec delay (a full second of interruptible
sleep). It just doesn't make any sense... I have sent messages
regarding this function several times (and patches have existed for a
while), but no one has had any comment. I appreciate your input
greatly. What do you think?
Thanks,
Nish
