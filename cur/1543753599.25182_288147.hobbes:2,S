Excellent.  Judging by the DSP Load, your machine seems to run almost
twice as fast as my 1.5GHz Athlon (surprising).  You might want to try
pushing it a bit harder by running more clients (2nd parameter,
default is 20).
Are you getting fairly consistent results running SCHED_ISO
repeatedly?  That worked better for me after I fixed that bug in JACK
0.99.47, but I think there is still more variance than with
SCHED_FIFO.
