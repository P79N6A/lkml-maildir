AFAICT, it's a *fix*.  The register in question is "for debug use 
only, never write anything other than zero in it" but generally shows 
non-zero when a faulty BIOS is installed.  We're zeroing the bit that 
appears to cause the problem.  It's highly unlikely to be an extra 
optimisation - if it is, it's an unsafe one.
