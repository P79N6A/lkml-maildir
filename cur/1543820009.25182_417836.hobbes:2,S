As much as I'd like to agree with this (SuSE also ships this module for
some odd reason), I do have reports of people using it for their
machines at times.
So, I'd like to keep this in the tree, for as long as the LSM interface
sticks around, if possible.  It's not hurting anything, and it does work
for users, and is a good example starting point for people wanting to
use the LSM interface.
Unless there are any known security problems with it?  If so, please let
me know.
thanks,
greg k-h
