Sorry, it seems the patch breaks lost-tick handling on x86_64.  Here
is a revised patch including its adjustment.
In kernel 2.6, update_times() is called directly in timer interrupt,
so there is no point calculating ticks here.  This also get rid of
difference of jiffies and jiffies_64 due to compiler's optimization
(which was reported previously with subject "jiffies_64 vs. jiffies").
Also adjust x86_64 timer interrupt handler with this change.
