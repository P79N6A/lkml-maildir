Another advantage of this mechanism is that, all else being equal, it 
will tend to run tasks that use short bursts of CPU ahead of those that 
use long bursts and this tends to reduce the overall time spent waiting 
for CPU by all tasks on the system which is good for throughput.  I.e. 
in general, a task that tends to use short bursts of CPU will make other 
tasks wait less time than will one that tends to use long bursts.
So this means that you were right and it is good in the scenario that 
you suggested even though that wasn't the motivation behind the design.
This means that this scheduler should be good for improving latency on 
servers that aren't fully loaded as well as providing good fairness and 
responsiveness when the system is fully loaded.  (Fingers crossed.)
