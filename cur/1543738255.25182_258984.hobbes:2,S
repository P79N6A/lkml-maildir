0 isn't correct either. No zero length packet was successfully received.
I agree with the current read() behaviour. It's the select() behaviour
that I consider to be wrong. Patching return values is just a hacky way
of avoiding the issue.
The issue can be more easily avoided by saying 'the Linux developers
believe that the use of select() with blocking file descriptors is
invalid or not recommended, and have chosen not to ensure that this
use of system calls is reliable'. "We're not POSIX compliant in this
case" isn't good enough for me. One acknowledges the issue. The other
ignores it.
Cheers,
