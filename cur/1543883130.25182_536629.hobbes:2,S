hmmm.
Now that devres is in the kernel, I don't think I am the best person to 
merge these sort of patches.  Certainly I can, and I know the code from 
my original review and subsequent usage, but I think the patch is more 
appropriate for Greg, going through normal maintainership channels.
IOW, I think devres is too generic to be queued via libata-dev.git.
Tejun, comments?
