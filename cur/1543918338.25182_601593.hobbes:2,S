No. I'm just using Google Mail.
And I'm not using any additional patches apart from what is in the mm-patchset.

Will try this, but as the error only seems to trigger, if I leave the
pc powered off for more then a hour, you will need to wait until
tomorrow.
Of note might be, that at the time of this error init has not been
started. I'm using a program from initramfs to start the RAID.
The initramfs was primarily build using the genkernel package from
gentoo, but I have removed some parts of it (kernel modules and some
other part I no longer remember)
