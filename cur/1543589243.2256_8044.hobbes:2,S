Subject: 2.4.4 breaks dhcpcd with Realtek 8139

dhcpcd stops working if I install 2.4.4.  Replacing the 2.4.4 version of
8139too.c with the 2.4.3 version and leaving everything else exactly
the same gets things working again.  Configuring the interface by hand
after dhcpcd has timed out also works.  Has anyone else seen this?
