Thanks.
Of your four, only "tosh" uses the device resources that we onyl now 
parse, and even that one only does it for a legacy region.
But so far at least nobody has reported a machine where it would do the 
wrong thing, so we're doing pretty well.
And I guess it would have been surprising if there were a lot of machines 
around with PCI resources we didn't know about - the reason it took so 
long for us to notice was exactly the fact that it's pretty rare that 
anybody uses it outside of the legacy region.
