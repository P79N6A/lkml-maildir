See that's the whole point, is there any performance issue with 248 vs
256 sectors? For a 248 sectors vs 256 command alone, I doubt it. The
only problem I see is for potential chop-ups of 248 - 8 - 248 - 8 - 248
- 8 - etc. But due to merging, only the last command should be smaller.
So I still think it's much better stick with the safe choice. Why do you
think it's only one drive that has this bug? It basically boils down to
whether That Other OS uses 256 sector commands or not. If it doesn't, I
wouldn't trust the drives one bit.
And finally, _I'm_ not imposing anything. The limit is driver tweakable,
always has been.
