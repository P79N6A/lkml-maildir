I looked into this. The problem I am seeing is not in printk().
It may, therefore, be in klogd.
I replaced the linux-2.4.22 printk() with the one that worked from
2.4.20. The problem presists!
The log-file, when booting the SMP machine is 7,653 bytes when
using 2.4.20. With linux-2.4.22, the first 33 bytes are missing.
