Apologies for that; the new one got added only last week, and escaped my
attention.

Yes, that looks correct. Other code, including the AS scheduler, was
(ab)using the colour field by storing a 'RB_NONE' value which was
neither red nor black to mark an 'off-tree' node, then checking for it
with ON_RB(). I changed that scheme -- we now set the node's parent
pointer to point to itself to mark an off-tree node. 
However, the cfq scheduler looks like it only inherited the macros from
AS, and was never actually _checking_ if a given node was on-tree or
not. So just dropping the magic initialisation stuff there is fine.
