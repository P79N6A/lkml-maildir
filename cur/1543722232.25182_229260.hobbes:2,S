Hi, 
I just did a new observation, this only seems to happen with udp
packets... 
Ie, i'm now transferring with ftp instead of nfs and it doesn't die.
if a udp packet is delayed and not sent, shouldn't it just be dropped?
I mean instead of restarting the network card?
Esp when it can kill a alta card after a while (ie reboot == only option
since it just refuses to go online again.)
