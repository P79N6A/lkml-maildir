Is there any code available that can do that as it is now?
This would be useful especially right now under x86-64.
As it is right now I either have the keyboard plugged into
both ps/2 and usb, plug it in only into usb (can't operate
grub) or plug it only into usb (enable emulation, can't
run linux ... ) and if the kernel could have a way of
disabling the emulation that would be good at least in
my case.
