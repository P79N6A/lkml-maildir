I wonder it may not good to use pgdat for resource controlling.
For example
In following scenario,
==
(1). add <pid> > /mnt/configfs/containers/my_container/add_task
(2). <pid> does some work.
(3). echo <pid> > /mnt/configfs/containers/my_container/rm_task
(4). echo <pid> > /mnt/configfs/containers/my_container2/add_task
==
(if fake-pgdat/memory-hotplug is used)
The pages used by <pid> in (2) will be accounted in 'my_container' after (3).
Is this user's wrong use of system ?
