I was getting very similar SMART results, and kernel errors, when used 
PATA drive and SATA_VIA (no freezes or hangs though):
SCSI device sda: 390721968 512-byte hdwr sectors (200050 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
sda: Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00

The problem was that I started smartd with wrong parameters:
DEVICESCAN -a -o on -S on -s (S/../.././10|L/../../6/11)
It was solved when I added "-d sat" to smartd parameters:
DEVICESCAN -d sat -a -o on -S on -s (S/../.././10|L/../../6/11)
 From that time on, smartctl -a /dev/sda gives "normal" output, and no 
more strange kernel errors.
Hopefully, it'll get fixed in smartmontools soon (or is fixed already, 
but not yet mainline).
