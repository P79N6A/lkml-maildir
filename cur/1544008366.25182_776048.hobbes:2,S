Yes, I agree.

Please fix checkpatch errors when altering code.  This function is
already a mismash of correct and incorrect styles - we might as well
increase the correctness density.
What we really want in this function is down_interruptible_timeout(). 
afaict we have all the infrastructure in place to implement that, but
nobody has typed
static noinline int __sched
__down_interruptible_timeout(struct semaphore *sem, long jiffies)
{
	return __down_common(sem, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE, jiffies);
}
and then tested it.
Or convert the whole thing to mutexes and write
mutex_lock_interruptible_timeout() :)
