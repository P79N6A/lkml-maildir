googling for this issue turns up quite a few questions about it - there's
already one possible answer in the source, couldn't hurt to stick in a few
more:
      if (lost_count++ > 100) {
              printk(KERN_WARNING "Losing too many ticks!\n");
              printk(KERN_WARNING "TSC cannot be used as a timesource.\n"
                    "Are you running with SpeedStep?\n"
+                   "Perhaps you should enable DMA using \"hdparm\"?\n"
+                   "etc..........)\n");
              printk(KERN_WARNING "Falling back to a sane timesource.\n");
              clock_fallback();
      }
not that you have to actually listen to me or anything...  :-)
