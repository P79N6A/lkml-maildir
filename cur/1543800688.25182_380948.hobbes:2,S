Especially not with plugins.  Flashplayer anybody?

Actually the crappy state of OSS emulation is a good reason to ditch
ALSA in its current implementation.  As Linus reminded not so long
ago, backwards compatibility is extremely important.
Also, not everybody wants to depend on a shared library.  I find this
"the alsa lib must be kept in lockstep with the kernel version" quite
annoying.  I'd rather not have the windows dll hell on linux, TYVM.
Or in other words, the public API of a kernel interface should _NEVER_
be a library only.  At least OSS, with all its issues, had that right.
  OG.
