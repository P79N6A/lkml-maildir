Thanks Robert.
Actually i'm trying to segregate IP and ICMP from the linux stack.
Thogh i do insmod of IP as well as ICMP, i'm having the linux stack as well.
In this case, if i do EXPORT_SYMBOL,
  the LKM ICMP module can refer the IP module instead of refering LKM IP 
module. But i want the LKM ICMP communicate to LKM IP only, not the kernel's 
IP.
Is EXPORT_SYMBOL the only way to solve this ? Any other idea ?
Thanks,
Vinolin.
