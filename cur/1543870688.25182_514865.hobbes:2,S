It might be more elegant but it won't work. We don't want to prevent
ACPI from accessing these I/O ports. If we need to choose only one
"driver" accessing the I/O port, it must be acpi, at leat for now,
despite the fact that acpi provides very weak hardware monitoring
capabilities compared to the specific drivers.
Why would we end up with an overestimation if we check the I/O ports at
boot time? Do you have concrete cases in mind?
