Duh. Colour me unimpressed. 
So some crazed FBdev person is going to copy all of the acceleration from
all of the other servers, and make a new "super-server" that does it all,
and call it XF86_FBdev?
Makes complete sense. NOT.

It _IS_ just an option. That option simply disables all of the
initializations and the cleanup. 
And YES, the acceleration and everything else code should work without
changes. Which is exactly my point - why the hell would anybody be so
stupid as to make a XF86_FBdev that does acceleration for all the chips
out there where we ALREADY have that code written and packaged up?
Somebody must be on drugs. Maybe it's me, but quite frankly, your
arguments just don't make sense to me at all.
