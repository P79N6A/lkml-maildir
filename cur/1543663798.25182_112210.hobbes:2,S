I am not all that sure, that it's a simple IDE problem. If it were I would
expect booting (and using) a linux live filesystems not to work. But that does
indeed work. There seems to be a problem around the ide-scsi stuff. If I can
try any patches of interest I will. If I can put in some debugging printk I can
do that, too. But as I don't know what is especially known-to-be-fishy around
ide-scsi I have no good idea where to start ...
