It's simple.  I want the old reliable behavior back, the one I found
in kernels from 1.1.41 thru 2.2.14.  The behavior that I have enjoyed
for 7 years, the one that allows me to chuckle when listening to
windoze user's expressing their woes.  Not the one that kills
important processes because of some fantasy AI, not the one that locks
up the machine.  The one that lets me run an unattended machine for
months rather than barely make it thru a week.
What you hear now is nothing compared to the roar that will occur
shortly (as the distributions start releasing 2.4 versions) when the
masses encounter the current surprises.  They will not be able to say
in detail how to change the VM, other than the above.  We want to USE
linux and depend upon it, not become VM gurus to fix our kernels.

trains itself to the load you put on the system. Hideously complex and
evil?  Well, why not wire up that roach on the floor, eating that stale
cheese doodle. It can't do any worse job on VM that some of the VM
patches I've seen..."  -- Jason McMullan
