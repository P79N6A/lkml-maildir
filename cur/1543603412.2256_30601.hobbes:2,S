I've used it in the past for an SGI Octane that was (and still is) used
to do real time TV studio quality (CCIR-601 YUV422 data, about 20MB/s)

It made the difference between "doesn't cut it" and "enough headroom".
IIRC it was something like 18MB/s without and 30MB/s with write
caching, but don't quote me on the exact numbers.
