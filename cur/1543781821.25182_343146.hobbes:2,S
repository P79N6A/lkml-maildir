Well, I don't have access to the code you're looking at so I'll make
the following suggestion completely blind.  You want the header file
which defines smp_nmi_call_function() to contain something like:
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
extern int smp_nmi_call_function(void (*fn)(void *), void *priv, int whatever);
#else
static inline int smp_nmi_call_function(void (*fn)(void *), void *priv, int whatever)
{
	return 0;
}
#endif
Obviously I've probably got the arguments to smp_nmi_call_function()
wrong, so they'll need fixing.  I'm sure the above will point you in
the right direction though.
