I'm using these devices and it works for me (using my Medley RAID driver). However, sometimes the system seems to hang for a while and then comes back, but it is quite rare.
I think you're waiting for Andre's DMA fix that he was going to have reviewed by SiI today, and promised out ASAP :)
In the mean time, hdparm -X 66 might help.
