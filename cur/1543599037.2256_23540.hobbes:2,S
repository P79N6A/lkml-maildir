Linus scheduler is pretty dire beyond about 8 runnable threads, but very 
good below that. It also has a refresh loop that is O(n) tasks, which is
strange, and actually looks easily to eliminate.
The critical bit is threads runnable at any given time. When that is low as
it is in almost all normal workloads the performance of the scheduler is
very good indeed.

Read kernel/timer.c.
