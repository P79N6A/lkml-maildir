Nonsense. The _ is used to provide for a new namespace, __ for a second one.
It is common to have a public function 'foo()' which does lots of error
checking and has a stable api. foo() in turn calls _foo() to do the actual
work, perhaps doing additional checking and verification.
The _namespace is bound by certain rules, some of which apply to the kernel
as well. The compiler is free to output symbols in the _Namespace, as well
as in the __namespace.
"To get specific, identifiers with two leading underscores are reserved for
 the compiler as well as identifiers beginning with a single underscore and
 using an upper case alphabetic character for the second. "
The linux kernel breaks this by using __ for even more private things.
I don't have K&R handy to check this. We might have some more liberty
because we do not link in libc.
