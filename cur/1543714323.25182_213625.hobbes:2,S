FYI:
  The 2.6.5-bk1 breaks VMWare GSX 3 module compile.
  GSX 3 uses the kernel module build system.  Problem
  is that the .tmp_versions directory is not getting
  created in the VMWare module directory.  Complies
  fine after manually adding .tmp_version directory.
  Assume that the kernel build system is failing to
  create the directory?
