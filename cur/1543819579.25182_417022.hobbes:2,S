Hi,
I'm using RedHat Linux 7.2 with compiled kernel 2.4.25.
My serwer has one cpu "Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.20GHz" with HT flag so
there are two processors in cpuinfo.
The processor has 2MB cache but `cat /proc/cpuinfo` shows only 16KB.
When I try to use 2.4.17 kernel, there is 2048KB cache but cpuinfo shows
only one cpu :)
I don't know where I should send my question, maybe You could help me.
I'll be very thankful for any answer.
Best Regards,
