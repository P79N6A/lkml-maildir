Better to wait and see if it was an artefact of my dodgy code for recover 
walltime and if this code doesn't have that issue.

The hardware that also did C4 was more troublesome but for the same reasons 
since it's a subset of C3. See Dominik's patches mentioned below which 
address these high state transitions. There isn't anything else offhand I can 
think of that I actually managed to track down :|

Dominik donated a lot of code to use the dynticks infrastructure to actually 
implement the power savings. Just skipping ticks seemed to make very little 
power difference unless we also used the knowledge from next timer interrupt 
to know how long we are going to be idle and choose C state transitions 
accordingly. Each patch is documented at length in the split out

From what I could see
hrtimer_restart_sched_tick() could use
struct hrtimer *sched_timer = &cpu_base->sched_timer;
clockevents_init_next_event() and clockevents_set_next_event() could use
struct clock_event *nextevt = sources->nextevt;

Great, thanks!
