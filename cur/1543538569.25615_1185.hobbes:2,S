Yep, I do, on Alpha platform.
Since the on-disk format has changed from the 'traditional' raid (which
is included in stock 2.2.x kernels) to the recent raid (included in 2.4.x,
exists as patch to 2.2.x) you must use the recent raidtools.
You need to tell them to treat your (existing) raid-array as 'old style'
by adding a line to /etc/raidtab, though.

I think it should run.
