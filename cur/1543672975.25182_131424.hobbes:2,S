The kernel fortunately already defines some semantics to using a
non-NULL first parameter without MAP_FIXED.  It means: I prefer
*exactly* this address.  If it's not available, give me anything else.
This is used and needed, for instance, when loading prelinked DSOs.
Now you want to give this another semantics.  It would need at least one
more MAP_* flag.
Anyway, I don't care what the solution looks like.  Changing existing
semantics should be out, that's the only requirement.  Since I don't
plan on doing the work I have nothing to decide.
