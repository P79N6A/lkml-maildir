I think you're right, we could do it that way too. And that should 
actually fix the problem that "do_wp_page()" doesn't even get the 
"write_access" status at all (since it is _only_ called for writes).
So yes, that should work.

The follow_page issue should be fixable by just marking the _page_ dirty 
inside the ptrace routines. I think we do that anyway (or we'd already be 
buggy wrt perfectly normal writes).
Ie the sequence would be:
 - handle_mm_fault(write/copy)
	This makes sure that we have done a COW. There is no other real 
	issue, but we obviously _do_ need to make sure that a private copy
	gets split. Marking it dirty is necessary: otherwise the private
	page might be thrown out by the pageout, resulting in the virtual 
	page being re-loaded with a clean (shared) copy. That would be 
	bad.
 - follow_page() looks up the page
	The page may indeed have been written out here (very unlikely, 
	but for the sake of the argument, let's assume so). However, that 
	doesn't matter - what matters is that the VM must not "re-share" 
	the page, so that if the mapping was private, we'll still have a 
	private page.
	Marking it dirty will guarantee this: even if the virtual page 
	gets evicted, it then gets evicted as a _swap_ page, not as a
	demand-loadable clean page.
 - we write to the page, and mark the "struct page" dirty with SetPageDirty()
	Now the page tables might be marked clean (but only if the thing 
	was a shared mapping), but because we marked the page dirty, we
	are guaranteed to not lose the data we wrote.
Do you see any holes in this?
