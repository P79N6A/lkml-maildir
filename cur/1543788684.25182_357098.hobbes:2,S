Thanks, I didn't notice it was since 2.6.12. woody dpkg
was long broken. I've only seen more recent reports about this.
To fix this problem, will require update to 
dpkg in woody; which might not be feasible.
We could drop support of woody chroots in etch.
It might be possible to add a workaround hack 
in [c]debootstrap to trap mmap; or fill 
status/available files before invoking dpkg.
I'm not quite sure why sarge manages to bootstrap despite 
having a dpkg version (1.10.28) that shouldn't work.
