All of this point to a bug in the Xen emulation host.  You're not saying 
  if you're on an Intel or AMD host, but on Intel, hardware 
virtualization doesn't actually kick in until you're in protected mode 
with all segments configured properly.  This means all of pmjump.S runs 
in an interpreter.  A bug in that interpreter would cause what you observe.
