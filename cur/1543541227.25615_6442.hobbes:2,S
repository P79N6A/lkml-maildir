Hi
I was waiting for the release of 2.4.0-test6 to see if this problem was
fixed, but I didn't see it in the release notes.
Anyway, I'm having problems with PPP on test5.  When I try to connect, pppd
hangs after it appears to have made the connection (in /var/log/messages).
ifconfig doesn't show ppp0, and after maybe 30 seconds it disconnects and
tries to dial again.  It works fine in 2.3.40 (the last version I was
using before upgrading to 2.4.0-test5 the other day).
When it finally gives up and disconnects, I get these entries in
/var/log/messages:
Aug  9 20:12:25 deadzone pppd[887]: Serial connection established.
Aug  9 20:12:25 deadzone pppd[887]: Using interface ppp0
Aug  9 20:12:25 deadzone pppd[887]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS1
Aug  9 20:12:56 deadzone pppd[887]: LCP: timeout sending Config-Requests 
Aug  9 20:12:56 deadzone pppd[887]: Connection terminated.
Aug  9 20:12:56 deadzone pppd[887]: Hangup (SIGHUP)
Aug  9 20:12:56 deadzone pppd[887]: Exit.
I'm using pppd version 2.3.10.
What other information do you need?  This is my first bug report to l-k.
