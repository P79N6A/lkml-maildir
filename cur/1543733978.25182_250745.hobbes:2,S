No, it was just a randomly-chosen batching factor.
The tradeoff here is between
a) lock acquisition frequency versus lock hold time (increasing the size
   helps).
b) icache misses versus dcache misses. (increasing the size probably hurts).
I suspect that some benefit would be seen from making the size very small
(say, 4). And on some machines, making it larger might help.
