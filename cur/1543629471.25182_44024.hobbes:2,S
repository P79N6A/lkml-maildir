np, we are in a development kernel after all. (-; It was oopsing in 
ntfs_put_super->truncate_inode_pages->clean_list_pages() with a NULL 
pointer dereference... I didn't investigate further as it was immediately 
obvious what was going wrong once I added a printk in the right place so I 
knew mftbmp_mapping was the problem child.

Exactly my sentiments! (-:

Yes, I thought about that but the ntfs patch was rather urgent as people 
were reporting hangs and I saw oopses on umount so I wanted to just fix it 
asap without entering in possible discussions of generic code...
The only problem is that inode_init_once() doesn't set all the above 
because part of the initialization happens in alloc_inode(), so not to 
sacrifice this optimization we would need two inline helpers, one called by 
alloc_inode() and one called by inode_init_once(), and both called by the 
new exported function init_address_space().
I will whip up a patch and send it for comments...
Best regards,
         Anton
