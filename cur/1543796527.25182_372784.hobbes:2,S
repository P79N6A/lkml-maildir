But isn't it? :)

Have you filed a but at bugzilla.kernel.org about this?  If not, how do
you expect it to get fixed?

That sounds very strange, the same kernel version should work just as
well for all workloads.  If not, it's a bug and should be fixed.

But it sounds like you will want different stable series depending on
what kind of server you are running.  And that will be even more work...
