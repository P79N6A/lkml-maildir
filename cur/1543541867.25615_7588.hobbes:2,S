When you're out of memory, you're out of memory.
The kernel can't magically make more.  Bumpers on cars are designed to limit
damage at tiny speeds but they don't do much good when you're doing 90.
The kernel is doing it's best to give you what it can, if you willingly take
all the memory, it's gotta struggle.  Improperly written programs will
segfault and crash when they run out of memory.
The kernel does try to kill off programs when it runs out of memory but
unless it picks the memory pig, then that program will probably immediately
grab any memory the kernel just freed.
