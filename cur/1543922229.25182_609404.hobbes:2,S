Did anyone ever write a driver that does i2c on the scx200 using the new
i2c-gpio method?  I sure haven't seen it, although I am still running
2.6.18 (since that is what debian stable uses) on my scx200 systems.  I
certainly haven't found any useful instructions on how to use the new
i2c-gpio driver on an scx200.
