Subject: [patch] clone-fix-2.5.34-A0, BK-curr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

this patch fixes a clone-flags bug noticed by Roland McGrath. The current
CLONE_DETACHED & CLONE_THREAD forcing code did things in the wrong order,
which makes it possible to force an oops the following way:
        main () { syscall(120, 0x00400000); }
instead of changing the order of CLONE_SIGHAND and CLONE_THREAD flag
forcing (which would fix the bug), the proper approach is to fail with
-EINVAL if invalid combinations of clone flags are detected. This change
does not affect existing applications.
