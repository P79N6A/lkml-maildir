You also need a 'class' so you can initialise things like block, then char,

It needs to call arch dependant code. PnP bios isnt very common on an alpha.

What if the driver says "Im in the middle of something" or "but there
is an fs mounted".
Just to remind you its -not- trivial 8)

ISAPnP is simpler than hot plug PCI and you have to do it in kernel space
to handle power management right, to handle clash avoidance and to handle
PCI/ISA IRQ route programming on the southbridge
The code for handling ISAPnP akin to current PCI is in ALSA and is part
of a good basis for this

CardBus is basically hot plug PCI

What about platforms with multiple spaces where an 'address' (ie a void *)

There is no need for an isa_readb() - readb() will be right. ioremap will be
required for ISA anyway.
As to the endianisms, please _dont_ do that. It encourages bad programming.
Instead of thinking how to avoid endian swaps people will write sloppy code
that just endian swaps every reference
