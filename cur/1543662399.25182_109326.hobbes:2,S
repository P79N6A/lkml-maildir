Subject: Loosing chars on serial console in 2.4

Hi List.
If I paste text into my serial console, some chars aren't echoed back. I also
loose some chars when doing reboot and init starts to print messages.
This is due to that almost no user of opost() bothers to check its return
value. The patch below fixes the problem, but it is ugly and possibly buggy. 
I don't know how to fix this properly.
HW: custom 860 board at 115200 baud, using the standard arch/ppc/8xx_io/uart.c driver.
