I mean that it's not particularly sensible to have an auxiliary interface (say
a separate /sys/cachefiles file) for setting the cache context as there may be
several caches instantiated simply by opening /dev/cachefiles several times
and retaining all the file descriptors involved.
I meant this as information only.
