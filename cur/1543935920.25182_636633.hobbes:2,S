It reproduces also with 2.6.23.13.
Finally I think the problematic disk is sdc:
ICH5 PATA -> sda
ICH5 SATA0 -> sdb
ICH5 SATA1 -> sdc
Promise SATA -> sdd
The problem is that even I have commented out the entry for sdc in fstab,
the system is still giving me errors. An my guess is that errors in sdc makes
the ICH5 sata controller go nuts, and then I get errors also in sdb.
Just a couple questions...
- Can I say to ata_piix something like 'please, detect first SATA ports before
  ATA', so my system disk (sdb) becomes sda ?
- Can I say 'plz, ignore port 1', so it does not try to detect/start/spin sdc ?
  So I ban be sure it is the one to blame, before start to remove hardware...
TIA
