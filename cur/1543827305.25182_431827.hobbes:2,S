Most rescans are initiated by a bus reset (usually caused by a
connect/disconnect of a device) that is detected in interrupt.
Obviously, we cannot initiate these rescans in interrupt, so a tasklet
or kthread is the only option.
The reason for handling user-initiated rescans (through some sysfs
interface?) and hardware-initiated rescans in the same place is code
simplicity, and synchronization.
I'm not sure what your implying about user-initiated rescans. The only
thing I can think of is device/driver binding, which isn't handled in
our kernel thread anyway (except where it's a new device being detected,
as opposed to a new driver being loaded).
