The use of __init in externs is done very infrequently right now, and is
probably causing <linux/init.h> to be included in a few more headers
that probably don't need it and thus masking the bugs in some .c files.
I also think it makes very poor documentation right now since it's done
a total of 24 times, and should probably be removed for consistency.  Or
left alone since <linux/init.h> mentions you can do it.
But personally, I'm against doing it.
