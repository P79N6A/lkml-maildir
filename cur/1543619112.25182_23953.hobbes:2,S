And of course there's not much point in having patches go to that list that 
AREN'T public (um, they're for inclusion into a public tree, right)?  So the 
patchbot might as well distribute to a mailing list, as long as there's some 
variety of moderation (possibly just a procmail recipe) to delete everything 
that didn't actually have a patch in it.  (Yet another discussion list is 
unlikely to help matters too much.)
Of course this still doesn't address the problem of patches going stale if 
they're not applied for a version or two and something else that goes in 
breaks them...
