Btw, with IDE disks, you might try to enable the drive lookahead by hand -
whether it is enabled by default or not may depend on the drive. Try if
"hdparm -A1 /dev/hdX" makes a difference for you.
(It probably doesn't, simply because it's probably already enabled, and
even if it isn't, the lookahead buffer isn't likely to be big enough to
help that much with the fundamental seeking problem in doing a recursive
diff).
