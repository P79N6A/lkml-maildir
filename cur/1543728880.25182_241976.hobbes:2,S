Hi,
I'm trying to install cedega (formerly winex), and it's complaining that my 
"pthread stack size", which is apparently 2052, is too small.  I'm running 
Mepis, but I'm using the vanilla 2.4.27 kernel.  Can anyone tell me if it's 
possible for me to recompile the kernel to increase the stack size?
Thanks,
Udo Hoerhold
