   The new symlink was added without considering the impact on modutils.
   I'm waiting for another kernel patch to go in (redo "make
   modules_install") before changing modutils.
This problem doesn't happen with modutils 2.3.9, FWIW, so I didn't
notice the problem.
Perhaps we should change modutils?
