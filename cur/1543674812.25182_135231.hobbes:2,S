   I also attached a patch that fixes the SET_MODULE_OWNER thing for
   net/ipv4/ by using static initializers
I can't apply these patches, there are errors.  You remove
the esp4_type->owner setting, but don't put the static initializer
in there.
I suppose you do test the changes you make in your patches, right?
What was the test you made to make sure the esp4_type module ownership
was set correctly? :-)
