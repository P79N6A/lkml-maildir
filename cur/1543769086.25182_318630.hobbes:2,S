Actually, it occurred to me that it would be better if the determination
to use the generic entry can be run-time specified (via a kernel option
flag, for example).  All the kernel config option accomplishes is a
cleaner way to disable the generic entry at compile time.
In any case, it'd be interesting to figure out the EXACT root of the
problem.  Let me spend a few days looking into it.
