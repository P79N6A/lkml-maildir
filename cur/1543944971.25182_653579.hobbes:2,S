I now made a patch based on the spirit of 
  
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=0263603a01e802f79e369ac489793e5320031560
- although that's surely the wrong way to go, because it'll break
the other options. I just attach it in case other people have the same problem.
Now I get other errors ...

and so on, and so on ...
I'm currently trying to use the pre-build binary from 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
 - but I'd prefer to build
the kernel myself.
Help, please? Anyone?
Regards,
Phil
