Subject: [PATCH 1/1] file capabilities: allow sigcont within session (v2)
(This is a proposed fix to 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9247
)
Allow sigcont to be sent to a process with greater capabilities
if it is in the same session.  Otherwise, a shell from which
I've started a root shell and done 'suspend' can't be restarted
by the parent shell.
Also don't do file-capabilities signaling checks when uids for
the processes don't match, since the standard check_kill_permission
will have done those checks.
