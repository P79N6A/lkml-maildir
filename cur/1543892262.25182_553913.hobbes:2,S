Theoretically it makes the stacked file concept more brittle, because
it means the lower layers can't care about their inode number.
We do need something to tie these things together.
So I suspect what makes most sense is to simply rename the dentry
SYSVID<segmentid>
That should give you the necessary information while not doing something
that is a long term maintenance problem.
Do you think you can cook up a patch to that effect?
Otherwise I will see if I can.
In practice I'm not really against your change, but I would prefer
to leave the code in a state where someone can reimplement hugetlbfs
or shmfs and we simply don't care.
