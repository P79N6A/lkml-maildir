playing with some stuff I notice that (on 2.2.x) current->blocked is not
cleared on exec().  Is this by design or by default?
Yes, I probably shouldn't exec() from a signal handler, but it solves a
unique problem for me.  Are there any major drawbacks to this that I
haven't seen, or should current->blocked be cleared on exec() ?
