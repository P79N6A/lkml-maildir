I still have all 354042 records of it. ;)
The first column is the times I found this line in page_owner.
I divided the counts for the duplicate lines (mempool_alloc+83 and
kcryptd_do_crypt+0) by two, so normalize them. There still are some
false positive counts in there, so it does not match the 354042
precisely.

Blaming it on dm-crypt looks right, as the leak seems to happens, if
there is (heavy) disk activity.
