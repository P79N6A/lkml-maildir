Ah.  Well this might be possible.  The HP HPET hardware is on each NUMA 
node. So cross node issues could be addressed. The bit counter isn't an 
open point for the HPET driver.  Only the HPET timers which march 
against the bit counter can be opened.  The current open logic in the 
driver hunts to find an available timer.  To coexist with mmtimer and 
just enabling the mmaping of the bit counter would require changing the 
driver API.  The other API issues are resolvable with little effort.  I 
think ;-)
