Oops. Should not he do it himself? This will make samba non-portable
and what is worse samba will not run on ext2.

Is sharing modtime this critical? I can see samba asking for both

This should be done in userspace. Editing /etc/passwd is certainly not
performance critical so podfuk is just the right
answer. (
