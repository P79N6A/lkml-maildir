Have you tried the "nocto" mount option for your NFS filesystems.
The cache-coherency rules of NFS require the client to check with the
server at each open.  If you are the sole client on this filesystem,
then you don't need the same cache-coherency, and "nocto" will tell
the NFS client not to both checking with the server in information is
available in cache.
This should speed up the time for open considerably.
