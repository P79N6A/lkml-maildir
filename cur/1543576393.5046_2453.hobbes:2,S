  Another question: what if I need to purge the page
table of all files as well?  Is there a clean way to
do that?  I've been looking at /mm/memory.c, but it
doesn't look like clear_page_tables, etc. get
exported.
  I need /all/ read requests to go to disk, and it'd
be nice if I could do that without a reboot (but I'll
take the reboot if that's the only way to go about it
:)
  Thanks again,
  	Al
