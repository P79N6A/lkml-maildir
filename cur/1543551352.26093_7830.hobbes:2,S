How about the kernel itself?  How do I access the memory above 4GB inside a
device driver?

Yes, it's ugly, but it works and it's compatible.  Well, compatible with 32-bit
code, probably not compatible with Linux code overall.
Of course, you could define a pointer to be a 48-bit value, but I doubt that
would really work.
