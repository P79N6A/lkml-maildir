sorry, what does prevent people from creating a 2M file, filling it with
pagefaults, closing creating another one and so on? Either "this"
accounting is applied to hugetlb files too or it's insecure.
Now if they didn't change the creation of the hugetlb files to be
allowed if the rlimit is !=0 then it wouldn't be insecure, but they
changed that in the first patch.
could you post a final patch once you're ready so that I will apply and
verify that I can exploit it? If it doesn't break it'll be still messed
up w.r.t. chown semantics (a true quota would get that right).
