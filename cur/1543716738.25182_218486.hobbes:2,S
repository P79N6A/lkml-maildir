This doesn't build for ia64 sn2_defconfig (probably not for numa in general).
One of Andi's patches, numa-api-vma-policy-hooks.patch, is missing four
#includes of linux/mempolicy.h.
I have posted an updated version of that patch on Andi's numa thread of a
month ago - cc'd to akpm.
With this updated patch, this configuration builds.
