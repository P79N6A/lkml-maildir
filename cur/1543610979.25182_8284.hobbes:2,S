That's not the problem: knfsd has always done readahead via the page
cache.
The problem is that the generic_file_read() stuff caches info about
the status of readaheads in the 'struct file', which is a volatile
object in NFS (it is released after the NFS request has been serviced).
To work around that, knfsd copies that readahead status data from the
struct file into a private cache, and trots it out again upon the next
READ call to reference that particular inode.
Cheers,
