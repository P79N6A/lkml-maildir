Subject: [PATCH 0/2] x86: Reduce pressure on stack from cpumask usage -v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/21/73

v2:
    - fix some compile errors when NR_CPUS > default for ia386 (128 & 4096)
    - remove unneccessary includes
Convert cpumask_of_cpu to use a static percpu data array and
set_cpus_allowed to pass the cpumask_t arg as a pointer.
Conditioned on NR_CPUS > BITS_PER_LONG.
Compiled and tested for i386 and x86_64.  I'd appreciate
feedback on other architectures.
(Note: there are still compile/test errors when NR_CPUS > 256
due to cpu id being 8 bits among other things.)
