Likewise, until I realised that virt_to_bus(skb) produced a nice
32-bit handle to give to the card.

It looks like I'll be doing something similar, but different:
struct queue {
  ...
  void * free_list;
  void * pointer_list[max_pending_buffers];
}
Start with: free_list -> pointer_list[0] -> ... -> pointer_list[m-1] -> 0
at pci_map:
tmp = free_list         (null tmp means free_list exhausted)
free_list = *tmp
*tmp = skb
handle = tmp - pointer_list
at pci_unmap:
tmp = pointer_list + handle
skb = *tmp
*tmp = free_list
free_list = tmp
all with some juicy casts. This has the advantage of O(1) for both
insert and delete and uses only one more pointer (or perhaps index).

Moral2: don't trust firmware assembler hackers. :-) :-)
