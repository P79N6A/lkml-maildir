This problem is not new. Kernel probes for filesystems in a particular
order for mounting the root fs. And mount understands the fstype=auto in
/etc/fstab. There is no perfect solution but it's sure possible to come
up with something acceptable and workable with not too much effort, for
a configuratble subset of file-systems. This is not that much different
from an automounter/usermount mounting a USB storage device or cdrom:
ext3, ext2, udf, iso9660, vfat, read-only or not, just to name a few
things. This should work anyway.
