Hi everybody and happy new year!
Just one simple question about a very simple matter that right now 
I can't figure out: does udev need hotplug package presence?
From your README:
  If for some reason you do not install the hotplug scripts, you must tell the
  kernel to point the hotplug binary at wherever you install udev at.  This can
  be done by:
	echo "/sbin/udev" > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
...does this work properly? It's not clear if some features are lost by not having 
hotplug script installed. Also is this policy subject to changes in the near
future?
Bye and thanks
P.S.
