Not true.  Uncontrolled message spewage inevitably results in critical 
information scrolling off the screen, before a user can take a digital 
photo of the output...  Or of users being confused by subsequent error 
fallout (i.e. multiple oopses reporting problem).
Moderation and restraint still have roles to play...  :)
