For example,
config SYSFS
        bool "sysfs file system support" if EMBEDDED
        default y
What does 'if EMBEDDED' mean?Can I choose n here?
I saw there is no corresponding option within `make menuconfig`, so I
am wondering what can I do if I wanna to disable this option, directly
change
"default y" to "default n" in the Kconfig file?
Thanks
Jason
