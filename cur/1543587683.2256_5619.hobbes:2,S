still.. if you want to log multiple class B's it's a PITA, especially
if your ruleset changes and you have to atomically replace all chains
in one table to update the ruleset from userspace->kernel.

That sounds like crap (sorry). Counters are resettable, and will be.
If you run two applications resetting counters individually, you have
a problem with your applications.

so why are your applications resetting counters then? Nobody forces you
to reset them right now.
