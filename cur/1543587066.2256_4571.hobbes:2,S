are there samples of linux codes that can talk to SCSI harddisk, scanners 
and
cameras in the Linux kernel.  Like in windows NT, one does not need to write
driver for his scsi device. Just use some scsi interface libraries to talk 
to the scsi device. Is there such examples in linux?.I need to learn this so 
that i can develop the same thing for a scsi digital camera.
