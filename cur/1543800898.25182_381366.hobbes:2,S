Hi all,
does anyone know what this could sata error message could mean ?
ata2: translated ATA stat/err 0x51/0c to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0xb/00/00
ata2: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
ata2: error=0x0c { DriveStatusError }
I get *lots* of this when I copy files from the sata disk to some
ieee1394 device and it seems they are sharing interrupt 16:
 16:     430796   IO-APIC-level  ide2, ide3, libata, ohci1394
Happens with kernel 2.6.15, asus a7v8x, sata_promise tx2/4 ...
>From time to time I can trigger a cold freeze, but it is not exactly
easy...
Any ideas ?
Soeren
