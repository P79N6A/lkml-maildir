True, but without the code you're removing it will simply hang the
system, which isn't a correct response to a detected bug.  And if I had
a shilling for every time someone's predicated a code change on "oh,
users will never do this" ... I'd be reasonably rich.
This also leads naturally into the next observation:  Checking in the
request function should be done.  However, it makes little sense wasting
resources preparing requests we know are going to be killed, so the
correct thing to do seems to be to abstract the checks and do them in
both prep_fn and request_fn.
