The standards way is asynchronous io (aio_* interfaces). That is being

The API isnt directly the problem. In fact you can make a fine scalable select
by implementing
	poll_setup(..............)
	poll_add/poll_remove
	poll_wait
as multiple calls giving basically the same interface that apps expected
anyway.  Take a look at the various /dev/poll experimental interfaces and
bits of code.
