Right - it's simply transferring work from one place to another.

I just don't see any point in doing this.  If the aggregate system load is
unchanged (possibly increased) then why is cbus desirable?
The only advantage I can see is that it permits irq-context messaging.

And when we deliver it later, we slow processes down!

To enable more interrupts to come in while we're doing that work.

I agree that being able to send from irq context would be handy.  If we had
any code which wants to do that, and at present we do not.
But I fail to see any advantage in moving work out of fork() context, into
kthread context and incurring additional context switch overhead.  Apart
from conceivably better CPU cache utilisation.
The fact that deferred delivery can cause an arbitrarily large backlog and,
ultimately, deliberate message droppage or oom significantly impacts the
reliability of the whole scheme and means that well-designed code must use
synchronous delivery _anyway_.  The deferred delivery should only be used
from IRQ context for low-bandwidth delivery rates.

Have you tested the average forking rate on a uniprocessor machine with
this patch?  If the forking continues for (say) one second, does the patch
provide any performance benefit?
