Hi Paul,
No, this patch is bogus, sorry.
split-include.c is a normal C program which does not use or know about
any kernel facilities.  You ought to be able to compile it on any Unix
system with an ISO/ANSI standard C compiler (not even a Linux system).
If you are having problems compiling split-include, then you probably
have problems compiling any C programs that use normal C library
facilities.  split-include just happens to be the first one you see.
This question comes up frequently, and I've written a patch with an
explicit scripts/hostcc-test.c test.  I'm sending the patch to
linux-kbuild for feedback.
