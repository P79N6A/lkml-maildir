We seem to have managed to keep XFS going without the memory reservation
scheme - and the way we do I/O on metadata right now means there is always
a memory allocation in that path. At the moment the only thing I can kill
the system with is make -j bzImage it eventually grinds to a halt with
the swapper waiting for a request slot in the block layer but the system
is in such a mess that I have not been able to diagnose it further than
that.
A lot of careful use of GFP flags on memory allocation was necessary to
get to this point, the GFP_NOIO and GFP_NOFS finally made this deadlock
clean.
