Probably bad memory, less likely bad motherboard, even less likely bad
processor. I don't know of any showstoppers that would freeze a box with
good hardware on 2.2.x. Might be a bad card - video, usually - but I doubt
it. Try swapping the memory.

Nah, this isn't a problem. The floppy complaints are just the kernel
trying to acces an empty floppy. The 'can't locate block-major-XX'
messages are kmod trying to pull a module for a device - namely, block
major 22, which IIRC is for ide-2 and major 3, which is for ide-1.
