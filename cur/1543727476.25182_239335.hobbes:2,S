| hi list,
| this patch make int_sqrt() handle long properly. i tested it
| on my alpha and i386. also some comparision again an alternativ int_sqrt() code.
| The placement (and using) of 'tmp' is a bit odd but faster (on alpha, no matter on i386).
| 
| happy hacking,
| walter
| 
| ps: i must use c&p so be aware of possible tab->space translations

Hi Walter,
I found a little time to play with this.  I only tested it on
a P4 UP machine (via userspace app).
It does indeed speed up integer sqrt typically by around 3% for me.
