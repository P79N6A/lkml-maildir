I looked at this some time ago together with BenH and Bart. The problem 
seems to be that the taskfile statemachine for identify is quite broken.
(even when it didn't hang it usually returned only garbage on other
CD ROMs). 
The CD ROM doesn't answer the request for some reason and then the
Linux taskfile code goes into an endless loop sending retries.
Bart had a patch to at least cure the hang by erroring out.
