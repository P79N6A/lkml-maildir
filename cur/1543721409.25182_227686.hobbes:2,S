  That appears to do the trick on my rx8620:
ipmi message handler version v31
ipmi device interface version v31
IPMI System Interface driver version v31, KCS version v31, SMIC version
v31, BT version v31
ipmi_si: ACPI/SPMI specifies "bt" memory SI @ 0xffc30040000
ipmi_si: ipmi_si unable to claim interrupt 17, running polled
 IPMI bt interface initialized
I still can't confirm whether or not the interface works, but this is
definitely better than before.  Thanks,
	Alex
