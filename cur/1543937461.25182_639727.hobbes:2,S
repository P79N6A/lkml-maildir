I hope it's better than this: lockdep really stops checking after first
warning, but I've understood from David's description that after fixing
this one place lockdep seems to be pleased.
On the other hand, according to Greg the code is OK, so if there are any
such warnings they simply have to be false! (...Unless you trust lockdep
more?!)
