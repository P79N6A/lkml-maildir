The SATA drivers are still there. The IDE drivers are
there and haven't moved. I'm not sure what you mean by "EATA drivers".
The EATA is an old SCSI controller series. What did you actually select ?

Neither drivers/ide nor 2.6.19 drivers/ata support suspend to ram.

In the case of the Nvidia SATA and PATA driver, because they passed months
of testing and nobody hit any problems with them.

Given you keep burbling about EATA drivers it's hard to guess what you
are even asking. Assuming you mean drivers/ide - it never supported the
SATA Nvidia ports. The PATA Nvidia ports are supported by drivers/ide or
drivers/ata (your choice)

Well I was considering help and advice but since you've nothing better to
do but insult people with stupid commentd about Intel chips I've put you
in my killfile instead.
