Nope.
HZ-derived values are not scaled in the /proc code.
The real value is not available to apps. (Linus said so)
People often change the HZ value.
Thus we have problems.
Maybe I'll post my disgusting hack. You _can_ get HZ out
of /proc if you know where to look. >:-)

That does not report the real value. It reports the default.
