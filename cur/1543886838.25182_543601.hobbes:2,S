Well I suppose I could toss it in there for a bit of review-and-test.  But
I'll need to drop it again because we do need to split this patch into the series
of patches, please.
You should do this earlier rather than later because it improves reviewability.

No, it needs to be a proper release function, like all the other ones
around the place.
This comes up again and again and again and I recently asked Greg to direct
me to (or to write) suitable documentation, and I think he did, but I lost
it.  Greg, can you remind us please?

We don't use typedefs in-kernel.  Please convert the code to use `struct
ntp_fp' everywhere.
For RFC compatibility to userspace you can do
#ifndef __KERNEL__
typedef struct ntp_fp ntp_fp_t;
...
#endif

Your answer has no relationship to my question.
The problem here is that under a 64-bit kernel we require that applications
which use this structure definition work correctly when they are compiled
to generate 32-bit code and when they are compiled to generate 64-bit code.
Furthermore we should aim to to have to code work correctly across
different version of the compiler, and when different compiler options are
used, and when altogether different compilers are used.
It is not clear to me that your definition is sufficiently defensive
against _any_ of these things.

You misunderstand.  I'm not saying "remove the callsites".  I'm saying
"remove the definitions".
Because we already have things like pr_debug() and pr_info(), so new code
should use those rather than reinventing them.
Plus, we already have at least 52 different implementations of "dbg" in the
tree and your 53rd one didn't compile because it clashed with someone
else's.  This is the compiler sending us a message: "use the exiting
infrastructure".   If that infrastructure is insufficient then let's
improve it.
