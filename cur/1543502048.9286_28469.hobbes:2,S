Yes the documents are poor. They should be more detailed, and fully describe what
the system does. However, they should actually be describing what happens now. Just
*think* instead of complaining. It can't be better than it is. If you want tighter
control you need something other than Linux, Unix, NT, Mac OS, etc. You need
something like VxWorks, and *extreme* control over what runs and when.
Consider this. The clock ticks at 100Hz. Sometime during the current 10ms interval
I start a 10ms timeout. The system knows not when. The system *must* add one to the
timeout to allow for that ambiguity in the start time, to ensure the interval is at
least what was requested. If the system is really lightly loaded and I keep
restarting 10ms timers every time they expire I will keep hitting a point early in
a 10ms interval, and the actual delay will be 20ms every time. Just like sending
voice over a non deterministic medium like an IP will never give predictable
quality, low delay audio on a non-real time system will never work in a smooth
predictable way. It wasn't one of the design goals.
Bottom line: with a 100Hz system clock a Unix (or for that matter NT) like system's
best effort at a continously restarting 10ms timeout on a lightly loaded machine is
actually 20ms.
