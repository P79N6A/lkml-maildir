Are these questions about 2.2 or 2.4? I'll assume the latter.
It doesn't need to drop the lock, it depends entirely on how requests
are handled. If requests are simply queued to the hardware (or
otherwise quickly dispensed) you may as well keep the lock.

The request fn will not be reinvoked until the queue has been plugged
again, and that requires that the queue has been emptied. In 2.4
devices use plugging by default.

You must finish the queue. Otherwise the device will not be plugged
again...

You can get away with not holding io_request_lock when calling
end_request (or end_that_request_*) if it is the first request on the
queue. By default devices have an active queue head, and the block
layer will not touch that one once the queue is unplugged. For all
other cases, the lock should be held.

Right, this would be bad. Devices that do need to sleep, can move the
requests to an internal queue and process them out of request fn
context.

?? You specifically must not replug the queue, if you don't want to
be reentered. If you exit before having processed all requests in
the queue, you need to replug -- but I would consider doing that from
the driver pretty hacky.
