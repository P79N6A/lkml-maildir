I know you are feeling uneasy at best, but I have more or less the same
problems with two Raptors (WD740GD) on two Asus P5GCD-V Deluxe (ICH6) MBs. I
had to pull them out of the box to use the boxes, because they were
constantly freezing...
Report is here:
http://linux.tar.bz/reports/oopses/char/2.6.15.1-K01_P4_server.3.dmesg
	(and the dirs above)
So far I got one or two "me too" responses, but that was all. I think the
last working kernel was 2.6.11, but that is a bit too old to test now and
then I was not using libata, AFAIR.
Now one of the boxes uses Seagate ST3250823AS (25d uptime) and the other an
old PATA WDC WD102BB (yes that is only 10GB!).
How reproducible is yours?
We might file to bugzilla? (So far I always had the attention on LKML quick
enough)
Kalin.
