I guess I'm the one to blame :-(  Our kernel performance project needs to
be more active in testing pending performance patches that sits in -mm.

The discussion on wake-up load balancing started July 28 last year [1].
In that post, it was outlined that the performance patch gave 2.3% gain
for db transaction processing workload.  It was then followed up by a
couple of iterations, including one from Ingo[2] and one from Nick[3].
I think we just demonstrated that there are two workloads exist today
which has completely opposite requirement on load balancing in the
wake up path.  People has tried to make kernel smart and detect work-
load environment, but so far it hasn't worked.  And hence the sysctl
that I'm proposing right now.
