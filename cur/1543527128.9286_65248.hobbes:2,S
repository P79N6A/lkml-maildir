Eh? But you are using bitwise or. I had logical or, whose order is
defined, being that of lazy left-right evaluation, and whose precedence
is looser than that of the relational operators precisely so that you
can write boolean propositional compounds without those annoying parens.
Or am I wrong? It's been at least 15 years since I read K&R ...
Nah. No chance.
