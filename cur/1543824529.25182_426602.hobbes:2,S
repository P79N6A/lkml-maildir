You can't change the mode, instead you have to track it and use the
one that is already set. Changing the mode on a lot of cards that we
don't have docs for requires making BIOS calls using VM86. VM86 only
runs from user space and user space may be dead when you want to
print. WIndows can take a different approach since they have access to
the video hardware docs.
