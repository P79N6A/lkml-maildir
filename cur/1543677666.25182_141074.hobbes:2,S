Well, at the risk of torquing off any SCO supporters, I'd suggest a quick
peek over at the general design of the AIX errpt/trace systems - in both
cases, data comes out of the kernel in a formatted binary stream, and then
a 'template' file is used to drive the parsing of the formatted data.
Quite slick overall, and nicely extensible - you add a new kernel subsystem
that has more trace points, you just tack its templates onto the end of
the format file and you're good to go....
(And SCO can't even claim that's their code - it's pretty obvious the
parentage of the AIX errpt/trace logging is the OS/VS1 and MVS SMF logging
features :)
