Yes, but the problem is that lspci etc... will suddenly see a bunch of
ffff's all over the place instead of the device. In fact, I think we do
use -some- cached infos already there but not for everything.
And that breaks .... distro installers :0
For example, currently, if I power off the ethernet of my mac, or the
firewire chip (which are powered off if the module isn't loaded), lspci
will get the device id and vendor id right ... but won't get the class
code.
I'm not sure about kudzu/udev/whoever, I've had problems with distros
not loading the modules because they couldn't find the chip because it
was off because the module wasn't loaded ... (typical of chips like
firewire which are loaded by class code).
So I agree... but :)
In a perfect world were everthing goes via sysfs and we have files that
expose all the necessary cached infos for identifying the device
(vendor, device, subsystem ids, class code, etc... which we do have in
sysfs), then yes, we can probably make config space accesses to an off
device just return ff's or an error (on some platform, they have to be
blocked as they can lockup, happens with some cells on the mac when
unclocked).

Yes, distro HW detection tools mostly.

I agree.

We need to enquire which userspace apps have a problem here. It's mostly
a distro matter... or we can force their hand :)
The problem is mostly obsolete crap not using sysfs, like ... lspci :)
