If PSE is available, it is used to map the bits of the kernel's
VA which permanently maps all of physical memory.  As a result, those
pages cannot necessarily be looked up via a normal page table walk.
Anything dynamically mapped --- ie. high pages (if using PAE), or
vmalloc/ioremap pages --- is mapped using normal 4k ptes.  
mem_map[] is completely unaffected by the use of PSE, and continues to
keep one entry per 4k physical page regardless of how the page tables
have been constructed.
