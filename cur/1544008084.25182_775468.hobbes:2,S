While this removes a lot of complexity it also makes it unusable for
what most people are using UnionFS and AUFS for today. If you want
people to use and test the code whiteouts and object creation/removal
have to be there from the start or you wont see the LiveCD and thin
client people trying it. Considering they make up the overwhelming
majority of the users of union directories/mounts it seems important to
have them on board.
