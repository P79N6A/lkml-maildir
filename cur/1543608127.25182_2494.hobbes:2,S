I tried it with 2.4.13 without the preempt patch and it worked ...i have not 
tried it without the preempt patch for 14, but since i'm not using the drm 
that comes with it.  The only thing that i think could be it is the new 
preempt patch.  I'm using the latest one you released for pre5.    Where is 
the 2.4.14-pre2 preempt patch?  all i see is pre5.
