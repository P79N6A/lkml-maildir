I replied to your privately already. I don't know how you get this
idea. It's easy to show that no process can go OOM on stack if every
process has backing reserved to take its stack pages when they have
to be taken out of ram for whatever reason.

No. Try again. If that's the best you can do, your whole argument till
now has been specious.

Perhaps you are confusing "not being able to start more processes" with
"an existing process getting an unexpected signal due to an
unobservable system condition not of its making or ever reported to
it". The latter is OOM. It can never happen when no process can start
unless there is swap space available to take its max stack (which
guarantees that stack memory is never overcommitted), AND every access
to malloc is wrappped as gnumalloc does it (which guarantess that heap
memory can never be overcommitted).
I posted a simple bsd-like accounting scheme + kernel policy that
guarantees the above and makes provision for both "secure" and
"non-secure" types of processes.  You can do better than it, but it at
least works.
