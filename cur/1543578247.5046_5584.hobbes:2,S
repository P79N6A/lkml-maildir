Hi!
I'm building an installer (to install Linux as a .tar.gz off an
SMB share) usind a single floppy with some compiled-in network
drivers. These drivers are modular in the .tgz which gets uncompressed,
but most of them need parameters (normally, you have to supply
a base I/O address). Getting the address is no problem - ifconfig
tells you. But I can't see an easy way (neither in 2.2.x nor in
2.4.x) th be told "eth0 is driven by eepro, eth1 is driven by
ne, ...")
Parsing `dmesg` isn't fun at all (even not with restricted floppy
disk space to store a number of output variants), and different
drivers do have *very* different outputs (if they annouce themselves
at all).
So I'd like to know:
        - Can you tell me a smart way to see which driver handles
          which network interface?
        - Would a patch to add eg. /proc/net/drivers reporting:
                eth0,   eepro,  0x300,  10
                eth1,   ne,     0x240,  5
          be accepted? I think sth like that would be useful at all...
In 2.4.x, register_netdev() would be a good starting point to do
it...
MfG, JBG
