It's not the leak caused by alloc_bootmem as kmemleak doesn't track
this kind of allocations. The block allocated via kmalloc in
vc_resize() is reported as unreferenced. However, I think that's a
false positive because it looks like the vc_screenbuf pointer is
stored in vc_cons[].d->vc_screenbuf which is allocated by
alloc_bootmem in con_init() and kmemleak doesn't track the
alloc_bootmem blocks. I'll fix kmemleak.
Thanks.
