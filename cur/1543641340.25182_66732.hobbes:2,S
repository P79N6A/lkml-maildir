It'e entirely possible that a DMA engine reset could reasonably set CIV to 
any of 0 (CIV = 0, offset 0), beginning of next SG segment (CIV + 1, 
offset = 0), beginning of current SG segment (CIV unchanged, offset = 0).  
I wasn't bothering to try and figure it out on each chip that we support, 
instead I was just calling a reset to make the hardware stop everything 
and get back to a sane state, then I would set the actual value to where 
ever we wanted it to be.  In most cases, that was either CIV + 1, offset = 
0 or CIV = 0, offset = 0.  However, that was really only a convenience, 
not a requirement.

No, I wouldn't do this.  If there are some chips now that have a read only 
CIV, then no big deal.  We change the DMA engine to treat all chips as 
having a read only CIV and then we don't bother needing to know which ones 
have which capability and we only need one DMA engine to drive all chips, 
problem solved.

Well, that could just be luck ;-)  The particular sound problem that 
Andris is seeing is related to DMA start and stop operations.  If you 
happen to be using an artsd or esd daemon that is configured to DMA 
silence when there isn't anything else going on, then DMA on your machine 
would *not* be starting and stopping and you wouldn't see this problem.  
That's why my standard battery of tests includes using play from the 
command line without X running at all since it actually starts and stops 
the DMA with each operation and does lots of drain_dac() calls.
