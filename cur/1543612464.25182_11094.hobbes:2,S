i have always had with problem normally during disk writes.
currently on 2.4.x-14 + 2.4.16

its not that it hangs but it gets extremely laggy eg 2/3 seconds pause
for keyboard input to appear on a console.

i have tuned with hdparm as much as i can. but i cannot tune the
VM because the files in /proc/sys/vm do not seem to make any difference
to the system at all and the documents dont seem to be correct inn
procfs.txt
if docs are wrong for a kernel version would it not be better to either say
they are wrong
or remove them alll together. but i assume this is todo with the latest VM
change.
are there going to be new documents for these files ?
