I presume that a correctly structured set of rules for udev should
accomplish the same thing; when udev runs, it could create links to
/dev/serial0 or /dev/serial/0 etc. as you wish. Applications
"should" use the udev-created links, not the raw, underlying device
nodes.
The biggest problem would seem to be that the assignment would
depend on the detection order; there don't seem to be unique 
id's that would help udev consistently assign device names in 
consistent order.
