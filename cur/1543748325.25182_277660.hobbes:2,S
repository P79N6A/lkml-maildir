I have 3 machines.  A (eth0) is connected to B (eth1) with a cross over cable and B (eth0) and C (eth0) are on a switch.  I want to forward the igmp queries and reports that A (eth1) generates when joining/leaving a multicast group on B (eth1) from B(eth0) to C (eth0).  I put the code to do this on different places such as ip_rcv, ip_route_input, etc and no luck.  The weird thing is that it works when I do a tcpdump on B's eth1. 
A-(eth0)----(eth1)-B-(eth0)----(eth0)-C
Thanks.
