You're asking _me_ if I can read?
Ten years ago, people used 'depends on' to fix the tools, so that then
you want to enable something like USB_STORAGE, it can automatically turn
SCSI on for you.
Isn't that what you wanted?
You don't need to screw over the technical users -- the _common_ case --
in order to achieve that.
We had it. TEN YEARS AGO. In the tools.
