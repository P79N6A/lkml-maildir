Hi,
I need to create a new kernel thread that will stay alive as long as
the system is up. This should be created as soon as the system boots. 
I need this thread to perform a specific task.
I am not very familiar with the code. Where should I put this thread
creation and my function code (I mean which file ?)? Do I use
kernel_thread function to create a new thread ?
Do I need to cleanup when the system exists ? 
What function should I call ?
thanks,
Allison
