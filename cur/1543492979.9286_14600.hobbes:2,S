Subject: 2.2.5 kernel not reusing filehandles?

I've got something bizarre going on with a 2.2.5 kernel. I keep running
out of file handles, but nothing is holding files open - lsof reports
only 800 files open while  /proc/sys/fs/file-nr reports 28000
filehandles allocated and 27000 filehandles in use! Am I right in
supposing that this is inconsistant?
The problem seems to occur when many files are opened and closed in a
short space of time, specifically by the Cyrus imapd performing a
search, but I'm having trouble causing anything else to exhibit the same
behaviour.
Anyone seen this?
John
