   I'd like to ask if there exists a backport of 2.4 serial driver to 2.2.x.
   I've got to get one Oxford Semiconductor PCI serial board with UART 16950 
   on it running but fail to do so under 2.2.17.
Yes, there is.  See

You can either compile the serial driver in stand-alone mode, or use the
install_in_kernel shell script provided to install the serial driver
into a 2.2 kernel tree.
