Jeff, I verified my patch is _almost_ enough for 2.6.18 for fully booting a 
32bit UML; on 2.6.18 I had to also add PTRACE_GET/SET_THREAD_AREA (this fix 
was merged in 2.6.19) to avoid tons of TLS errors.
On 2.6.19, the crash at boot is removed (btw, that crash output no message - I 
hope that with your fatal/nonfatal/etc. introduction I would get a message) 
but another one happens when starting init. I'll test 2.6.20 ASAP.
Bye
