Yes. Others look good.
BTW, can we decide on this quickly ? This patch actually changes
MADV_REMOVE value - which was added recently, so no app should
be using it, yet. But a major distro release is basing on current
mainline (2.6.16ish). I hate to see distro release having differnt
values for MADV_ from mainline - distro's will be stuck maintaining
that crap for ever :(
