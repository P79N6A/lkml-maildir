touch will create /dir/file if it does not exist.
If the command in 1 is supposed to change ACLs recursively, but not new
files, an entry needs to be added to your "cache" for removing the ACL
that 1 put on /dir/file.
If fileoperations creating files/directories need to be added to the
list and executed later, it's going to be a performance bottleneck.
