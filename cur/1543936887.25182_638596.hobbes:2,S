My misunderstanding. There is in fact no way to wait for memory to become
available. The poll() method you provide works nicely waiting for
shortages and responding to them by freeing memory.
It would be interesting to add FASYNC support to this. Some users have
asked for a signal when memory shortage occurs (as IBM AIX provides
this). FASYNC support would allow a SIGIO to be delivered from this
device when memory shortages occurred. Poll as you have implemented is of
course the easier way for a program to monitor memory and a better
interface.
