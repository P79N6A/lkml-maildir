The licence above looks like BSD /without/ advertising clause, which
is GPL compatible.  Note that the (GPL-incompatible) advertising
clause is the one that says "mention me in your advertising materials"
whereas the above licence only requires mention in accompanying
documentation and says /not/ to use the name of the author to promote
derived works.
See also 
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html,
 under "The
modified BSD license":
    This is the original BSD license, modified by removal of the
    advertising clause. It is a simple, permissive non-copyleft free
    software license, compatible with the GNU GPL.
The licence so described looks to me the same as LZF's licence.
Cheers,
Cameron.
