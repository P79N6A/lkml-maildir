Greetings.
First, please cc: me when replying. I have grep'd my way through the
entire kernel source tree as well as everything in '/usr/include'. Where
are the definitions for __SIZE_TYPE__ and __SSIZE_TYPE__ ? My last guess
is that they are hidden in the guts of gcc somewhere. I am working with
the 'posix_types.h' file in 'asm-mips', but I am not using the MIPS gcc
compiler currently. I am experimenting with some stuff right now. If
they do happen to be defined in gcc, is there a safe typedef of my own
that I can do? Thanks in advance.
