Now, I *may* have simply shot myself in the foot, but when I tried booting
2.6.10-rc2-mm1, I got spewed *thousands* of messages triggered by this:

Somehow, warning a *counter* is non-zero doesn't seem right (calling it an
underflow 4 times if the value goes 4, 3, 2, 1 and then NOT complain when it
hits zero?) , and I'm not flooded if it says:
	if (atomic_read(v) < 0) {
So is this code wrong, or did I introduce an now-detected underflow with some
self-inflicted patch that this is picking up?
