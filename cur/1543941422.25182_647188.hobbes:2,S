Some pieces of the patch are obviously wrong:  find_ibft() shouldn't be
in ibft_init ... if ibft_phys was zero, it means the bootmem reservation
wasn't done and you shouldn't be poking about in memory which has likely
now been overwritten.
Also, why is ibft_phys the global variable you pass?  You never actually
want to use the physical address, what you always end up using is the
kernel virtual address.
I'd simply use the ibft variable to point to the virtual address of the
ibft or null if not found, then you can throw out all the phys_to_virt()
calls.
Also, move the reserve_bootmem into the ibft_find routines and ensure
they're only called once on boot.  Refuse to attach the ibft driver if
the virtual pointer ibft is null.
