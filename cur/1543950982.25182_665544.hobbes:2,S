I asked for some pictures for thinkwiki, but nobody sent them in yet :(
You also need to know what glue to use (it needs to be one that is *not* too
hard when cured or it will just propagate the high frequencies instead of
dampening them), and where to apply it (it may be the chip, the capacitor,
or one of the inductors, etc).
As soon as the warranty on my T43 is over, I will do some heavy research on
the subject and hardware-mod it with Arcric ice, a PLL/ICH heatsink and
noise dampening.
