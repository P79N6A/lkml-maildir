Why not just send it to me and Andrew and get it merged.
The way we keep everybody honest (me, maintainers, and random developers) 
is with this concept called "open source", which means that anybody can 
fix a problem, and you don't need to wait for the "vendor". 
Yes, it's good to go through channels, but when that doesn't work, it's 
good to go _past_ them too.
