Hard to be sure, on this one I'm not convinced.  With mine, both controllers are 
recognised but display timeout messages which are not shown by the sequences 
reported below.
The hardware here is similar to mine though, mine is:
00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 82801FR/FRW (ICH6R/ICH6RW) SATA 
Controller (rev 03) (prog-if 01 [AHCI 1.0]
with 3x SATAs on raid-1 over reiserfs (although mine is a genuine Intel board).

Ditto.

My problem is also somewhat intermittent but fairly common, which makes it more 
difficult to track down than a completely reproduceable bug.
