Just out of interest, were you running the same config (boot params 
etc.) before moving to 2.4.24?
Have you looked at this page: 
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/exec-shield/ANNOUNCE-exec-shield
In particular the X workaround option.  I believe there are known issues 
with some versions of X and this patch, but the box I use it on isn't 
running X, so I use exec-shield=3 and have had no problems with the 
2.4.23-G4 patch on 2.4.24..... yet :-)
Thanks for the reply,
Phil
