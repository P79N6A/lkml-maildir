Yeah, I thought you would: makes our previous debates moot so we can
be friends again 8)
The reason I did the startfn thing originally is for the hotplug CPU
code: I wanted to make sure the thread gets onto the CPU while we're
in the notifier, so it doesn't go down again before the thread does
set_cpus_allowed().  Not a problem in practice, but it's nice to have
the BUG_ON(smp_processor_id() != cpu) in the code.
kthread_bind() solves this neatly, and we need it for migration_thread
anyway (which is the one thread where being on the right CPU effects
correctness, not just performance).
Cheers!
Rusty.
