Why does it make management easier to have no predictable name for a
device?

I think the space savings are a pretty good reason alone. Add to that
the fact I think devfs would be a good idea even if it cost MORE
memory... You can mount a devfs on your RO root instead of needing to
mount a tmpfs on /dev and then run udev on that. A devfs gives
consistant names for devices in addition to the user's preferred
user-space dictated naming scheme. A devfs means even with dynamic
majors/minors, even if you have new hardware in your system, your /dev
at least has the devices it needs.
