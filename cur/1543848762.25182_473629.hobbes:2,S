Don't think compiling both in is a good idea.
They both register as "autofs" so you really should choose one and
disable the other.
For my part I have to recommend autofs4 (personally I'd like to see the
autofs v3 module deprecated) and autofs4 is really needed if your using
autofs version 4 or above.
