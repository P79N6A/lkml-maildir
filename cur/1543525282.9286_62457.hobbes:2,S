Kernel 2.3.43 is out there, and already a couple bug reports are
trickling in.  For those who missed DaveM's announcement[1], here's the
deal:
The "tbusy", "start", and "interrupt" members have been removed, in
order to make the network driver interface more coherent.
THERE WILL BE BREAKAGE AND COMPILE FAILURES as not all drivers have been
updated yet.
Be patient.  Send patches, and/or wait for the maintainers to fix your
favorite net driver.  If you want to send patches, read DaveM's post and
also jamal's softnet HOWTO (posted in the same thread).
The most useful bug reports are ones for net drivers which compile ok in
2.3.43, but are not as stable as previous 2.3.x versions.
