Yup.  The application gets to decide what to do if its stat() or read() or
whatever failed.

Not too sure what you mean here.
The current behaviour of a oom-in-pagefault is to kill the caller via
do_exit(SIGKILL).  (Perhaps hugetlbpages should be doing that too).
If the page allocator decides "hey, this was a restricted allocation
attempt and we cannot satisfy it" then it should return NULL and if it's a
pagefault the app will do the do_exit(SIGKILL).  If it's a syscall, that
syscall will return an error indication (and there's a decent chance that
the application will then misbehave, but that's life).
