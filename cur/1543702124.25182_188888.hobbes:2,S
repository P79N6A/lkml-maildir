Hi Robin,
Thanks  for your reply.
Soon I will write explaining more about why I am not concerned about CPU 
usage which top gives.
Indeed you are correct and what I am after would be ps like correct uids. 
What I need is to connect(relate) them during the sampling time.
Then I will rename the variables in my code as advised by you.
Thanks
