I realized that some time ago, and now,
even though the code it still there,
the treble/bass controls are no longer
exported to the mixer. The driver now
works on a fixed frequency. Well, you
can still select one of the two base
frequencies, but if need be, I can
disallow also this. I am willing to
reduce the requirements as much as possible,
as long as it will help getting the thing
in, but perhaps allowing a single higher
frequency, or allowing just any frequency,
is pretty much the same task, and doesn't
look achievable within the currently existing
timer API anyway.
