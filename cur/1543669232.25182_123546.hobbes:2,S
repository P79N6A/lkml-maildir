It is due to this stuff, in drivers/char/tty_io.c:
	/* FIXME! What are the locking issues here? This may me overdoing things..
	* this question is especially important now that we've removed the irqlock. */
	{
		unsigned long flags;
		local_irq_save(flags); // FIXME: is this safe?
		if (tty->ldisc.flush_buffer)
			tty->ldisc.flush_buffer(tty);
		if (tty->driver.flush_buffer)
			tty->driver.flush_buffer(tty);
		if ((test_bit(TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP, &tty->flags)) &&
		    tty->ldisc.write_wakeup)
			(tty->ldisc.write_wakeup)(tty);
		local_irq_restore(flags); // FIXME: is this safe?
	}
We end up calling local_bh_enable(), which goes BUG if local interrupts are
disabled.  It goes BUG because local_bh_enable() will enable interrupts
unconditionally, therefore calling it with interrupts disabled is deadlocky
and wrong.
So our hand is forced.  We have to fix that crap up.  I wonder how?
