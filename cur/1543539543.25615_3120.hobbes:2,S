Yeah. Good attempt. Replace one flamewar subject with different even
more flame-provocating one. Bright move :-/

Thanx god, it's not true (yet). That's why kernel developers are STILL
not dropped linux BTW.

"World domination" is just a joke. We are playing different game. Really
different.

It's possible with 2.0, it's possible with 2.2, it's possible with 2.4,
it's possible with Windows 9X, it's possible with WindowsNT and Windows2000,
it's possible with FreeBSD and Solaris. There are NO way to fix HARDWARE
flaw with ANY software. Including ANY OS. If you are root (Administarator,
etc), you CAN FRY your disk, not matter "what and if". In Linux it's too
simple (and yes, I think it should be made more hard and Andrea suggested)
but there are no silver bullet.

ALL OSes out there are susceptible. You can convert such code from linux
program to Windows .VxD or .SYS easily.

Blame hardware manufacturers then. It's NOT Linux fault that current hardware
does not protected against software errors. Yes, it's stupid: instead of
few jumpers which can fix ALL such problem FOREVER companies are trying
binary-only programs for firmware upgrading and all such stupidity. Yes,
world it going to HUGE disaster really quickly but it's not Linux fault :-(

"Hacker kids" can download needed program from web. It's as simple as it is.

No. What IS matter is what's right and what's not.

If they stupid enough to make such switch then I do not care.

Go back to Microsoft NOW and stop whining. If (when?) linux kernel changes
will be made on "how to make it look better for dumb users out there" basis
linux DEVELOPERS will dump it. At least bright ones who do care about
clear design and not about marketing.

Blackmail, heh ? You ALREADY have OS where a lot of stuff to make it more
appealing fo "mere users" was added (Windows). It sucks. Let's not try to
repeat this error.
> And I think other users feel the same. Keep that in mind.
No, thnx. If kernel developent will become marketing-driven we can drop linux
as well and start to hack *BSD, HURD or even something like EROS OS. Keep
THAT in mind.
