Interesting idea.  Is this what you are thinking?  We find a slab page at the tail of the
lru so we call the related shrink function.  If the page is still active after shrinking, we 
requeue it at the head of the lru.   The slab page freeing logic would have to how to 
unlink from the lru.
The priority arguement of the shink functions would now allow us to keep the ratio of
lru size vs icache/dcache/dqcache under control.   This might be a knob that would
be interesting to have in proc...
