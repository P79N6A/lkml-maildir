ifconfig and dmesg don't show anything. However, the latest news is
that I rebooted (to 2.6.12-rc4 too), and it didn't reproduce. After a
few hours (plenty enough of time to get this bug), I tried to sleep and
resume the laptop a few times, I'll see if it bugs again now. Maybe
that's sleep related; as you say the usb layer looks fine...

basically my iwconfig command looks like
    iwconfig mode managed essid AP channel 11 key restricted aa:bb:cc...
this results in calls to zd1201_set_mode(), zd1201_set_essid(),
zd1201_set_freq(), zd1201_set_encode() (Once each, in this order). Each
of those, at the USB level, does some register reading/writing
(zd1201_setconfig16(), zd1201_getconfig16() and friends) and at the
end, calls zd1201_mac_reset(zd), which disables and reenables the chip
using some zd1201 commands sent down an urb.
I guess this zd1201_mac_reset() call is what "fixes" it.

There's a tx_timeout callback, but it does log to dmesg and none of
these lines appear.
But I think that the problem probably lies in a complex interaction of
sleep code and usb code, and simply finding a way to reset the
zd1201 chip when it misbehaves, instead of finding the root cause,
isn't the solution. In other words, I'll get a hard time finding this
solution :)
Thanks,
