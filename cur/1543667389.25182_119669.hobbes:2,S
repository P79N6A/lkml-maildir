Felipe,
Thank you very much for this input. I use rusty's latest modutils and rpmbuild those from SRPM  never seing the documentation hidden in .
For those who might have the same problem, I found info in module-init-tools-0.9.10/README available from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules
It is working now.
Thank you you again,
Michael
