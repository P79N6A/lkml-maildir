let me make that a little more clear ...
_nobody_ cares wether a shared memory page is
accounted as full page or as fraction of a page
(depending on the number of guests sharing it)
as long as the accounted amount is substracted
correctly when the page is disposed 
so there _is_ a difference between _false_
accounting (which seems what you are referring
to in the next paragraph) and imprecise, but
consistant accounting (which is what I was 
talking about)
best,
Herbert
