 this new class works only in places of the kernel were there were no
 RTCs before.. basically, I haven't touched the x86 or any other platform clock
 and focused only on i2c clocks which were actually not used.
 From the userspace point of view, the interface is the same. I noticed
 that hwclock does not like things like time that is not changing or
 an -EINVAL on a read, which can instead happen when you use
 i2c clocks. However, that is not an issue yet because hwclock has
 not been used on those i2c clocks until now.

 I' haven't tested it.. I think there may be problems because at some
 points some functions in the kernel needs to be renamed and/or
 changed.. i would say the first two patches should be applied
 together.

 thanks.

 good to know, that is also my preferred style. I will happily change
 this, I just thought the kernel style was the other one :)

 yes. I can't remember if it is intended, but the point of having
 hctosys was to copy the time early in the bootup process.

 will do.

 not implemented yet, I need to handle it in a different way. rtc_irq_set_freq
 is the kernel interface, I must move this check in the /dev/rtc code.
 How can I handle further updates, just repost the whole patchset
 to lkml ?
 thanks for you review!
