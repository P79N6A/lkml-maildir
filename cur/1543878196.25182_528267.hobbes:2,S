Subject: [patch 0/4] Clean up asm/bugs.h, identify_cpu() and update COMPAT_VDSO

Hi Andi,
Four patches:
 - clean up asm/bugs.h, by moving all the C code into its own C file
 - split identify_cpu() into boot and secondary variants, so that
   boot-time setup functions can be marked __init
 - repost of the COMPAT_VDSO patches with a bit more robustness from
   unknown DT_tags, and functions marked __init, since all this is
   boot-time only setup.
Thanks,
	J
