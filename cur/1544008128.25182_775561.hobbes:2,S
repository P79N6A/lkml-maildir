It doesn't matter if the fdtable changes while we scan the fd's or
after we're done scanning the fd's, does it ?  the end result is the
same - inconsistency.

Again, say we get all the struct file for all those fd's. Now we have to
drop the lock, and start processing the struct files. So what if at this
point the fdtable changes ?  we still end up with potentially inconsistent
state.
We can do it atomically or non-atomically, I couldn't care less.
My argument is the following:
1) Ideally, the state should not change while we are checkpointing
2) If the state changes, then the behavior is undefined (but the kernel
   should not crash, of course).
3) It should be the userspace responsibility to ensure that (1) holds
   (for instance, that all tasks sharing these resources are frozen
   during the checkpoint)
#2 will be an uncommon event - a programmer/user/administrator mistake.
Kernel may help enforce this rule, but catching all such cases will be
expensive as it means looping through all tasks for each new resource.
As a first step, we can ensure that all threads of a process are frozen
at checkpoint time (and prevent unfreeze until checkpoint is over). But
that will not cover a clone() with CLONE_FS. And this will be the same
for other namespaces later.
