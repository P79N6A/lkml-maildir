I use loadlin + initrd on my Toshiba and Ibm notebook. Boot up dos first,
then to either a test linux or stable linux environment from the C drive.
I setup a Menu in config.sys under dos to select which linux to boot up.
If the test kernel doesn't work, I reboot the system to switch to the
stable one. At least better than carrying a floppy around.
ps. Alan, thanks for replying to my "reiserfs replay" question.
