This is likely the same bug that I and a few others on this list
experienced.  Back out the 4 netfilter patches which went into -pre1 and
it should work again.
Look for the message with the subject "Confirm netfilter: repeatable
oops in 2.4.15-pre2" in the archives and it has the patches attached
which you should reverse apply to your tree.
