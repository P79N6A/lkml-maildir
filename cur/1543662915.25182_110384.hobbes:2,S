Subject: Trouble w/ e1000 v4.4.19 for Intel gigabit 82545EM on-board chip.

Under SuSE-8.1-CDROM supplied 2.4.19-UP with e1000 v4.3.15 module, this 
ethernet worked on a E7505 based Supermicro X5DA8 Dual Xeon motherboard
with the Intel 82545EM chip on board with no special kernel option
inserted.  The RJ45 is hooked to 100Mb/s speed CISCO switching hub.
Now, e1000 v4.4.19 custom-built 2.4.21-pre4ac4 with SMP enabled does not work.
e1000 is detected.  It appeared properly in ifconfig with its own 
HWaddr.  But it does not work.
For the moment, netgear 100Mb/s card is inserted and enabled by module.
And this one is working right now.
Does anyone have a similar trouble with e1000?
Thanks a lot.
Regards to all the Kernel developers.
