Sure does, that's what I first used, too. But then I had to hack with the
init script and it seemed quicker to 
  gzip -d < /boot/initrd-2.6.15.1.img | cpio --extract --verbose --make-directories --no-absolute-filenames
  vi init 
  ...
  find . | cpio -H newc --create --verbose | gzip -9 > /boot/initrd-2.6.15.1.img
It seems do_header() in init/initramfs.c checks for the "070701" magic (that
is specific to the newc format [1]), and populate_rootfs() should then
panic() with "no cpio magic" error message, but I'm fairly sure I didn't see
an error about wrong initramfs format when booting with an initrd made with
cpio without the -H newc option. 
This is what I see:
 RAMDISK: Couldn't find valid RAM disk starting at 0.
 VFS: Cannot open root device "LABEL=/" or unknown-block(0,0)
 Please append correct "root=" boot option
 Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
 unknown-block(0,0)
seems the "no cpio magic" message is somehow lost. It would be useful.
