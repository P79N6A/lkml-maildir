Right now it looks like it will be finished way earlier than app bother
supporting the later 8-bit encodings such as iso-8859-15
(case in point: Russel's system. I was ROTFL when he proudly announced he
was running a full iso-8859-1 system after dissing UTF-8. Last I've seen
the official 8bit EU encoding was iso-8859-15, and UK is part of the EU)
