Hi,
I have released another verison of the perfmon2 new code base.
This one is relative to 2.6.15-rc6 and hopefully should
fix some of the problems people have reported.
This new kernel patch fixes the following:
	- kernel panic in perfmon_pmu.c or perfmon_fmt.c
	  if PMU description or buffer format is compiled in.
	- missing __user in perfmon_syscalls.c
	- better handling of NMI reservation for X86-64, EM64T
	  and i386.
You MUST use libpfm-3.2-051215 with this kernel due to
interface change for pfm_create_context().
As usual, you can download the latest packages from the
SourceForge website at:
