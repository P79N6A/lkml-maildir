But the firmware comes after a GPL statement thereby leading to the
conclusion that it is their INTENTION to GPL the firmware.
If we have a source:
--
/*
     This file is under the GPL, yada yada
*/
#include "things.h"
void some_func(void)
{
   does_something();
}
char firmware[]={0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07};
void upload_firmware(void)
{
   do_upload(firmware);
}
--
Then it seems clear to me that the firmware is under the GPL because it
is PART of the GPL'd file. If not, then I don't see how any statement
can ever be true to similar effect, even for some_func().
