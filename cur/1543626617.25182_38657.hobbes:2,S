rotfl, btw.  oh my aching sides.  I may have to quote
that.  reminds me of windows 95 hardware detection
May I suggest chkconfig --level 2345 kudzu off, a less invasive way
to achieve this, without burning bridges.  /sbin/kudzu can still be run
manually then, if the hardware does change and you're lazy (and you
trust kudzu :)
