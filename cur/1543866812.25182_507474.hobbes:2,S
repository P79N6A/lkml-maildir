The kernel wouldn't necessarily have to refuse to suspend. It could just 
warn (and list the drivers that aren't marked), or could require some 
extra insistance from the user. It would be good to have it log a message 
saying something like: "If you can read this, report that ne2000 seems to 
be safe for suspend/resume". Having drivers explicitly marked as to 
whether they are safe is a good kernel feature; what to do if they're not 
is policy.

I don't see any reason not to do (2) regardless of (1). That was (my idea 
of) the statement that started this thread: new drivers need to not mess 
up on suspend/resume, as a matter of suitability for inclusion. Of course, 
we need some way for drivers to indicate that they work fine with the 
PCI-layer defaults. And it should probably more machine-readable than the 
author telling reviewers that it works.

I think the only interesting case here is when a device resumes fine with 
no driver support if the BIOS manages to deal effectively with it, but the 
BIOS generally doesn't. Otherwise, I think it's only going to work at 
all if the author put in the effort to make it work (so it should be 
"known good"), but there may be bugs (firmware, BIOS, driver, etc). But 
that's true of any functionality.
