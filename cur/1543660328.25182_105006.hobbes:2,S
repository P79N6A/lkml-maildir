| Hi Randy,

Yes, I'm aware of the tradeoffs and I expect to discuss most of it
openly, but I don't know that all nitpicking needs to be.
It could have negative effects, as you imply.
And some of my comments are just questions about "how does so-and-so
work?".  But I guess they won't be any more noise than we've had
lately.

OK, thanks.

OK.
Here are some more comments and questions.  I still don't understand
all of the code, so I'm not commenting on the guts of it just yet.
This is mostly about style.  I do have some code comments, but
I don't want to mix them in here.
1.  In include/linux/posix-timers.h:
Keeping with current style, these should be all caps (for "linux"):
+#ifndef _linux_POSIX_TIMERS_H
+#define _linux_POSIX_TIMERS_H
No other files in include/linux/*.h use this "linux" convention.
Same header file:  I think that you can lose this comment.
+/* This should be in posix-timers.h - but this is easier now. */
Same header file:
Why is sys_timer_delete() the only (new) syscall that has a prototype?
+asmlinkage int sys_timer_delete(timer_t timer_id);
2.  In include/linux/sys.h:
Increases NR_syscalls by 6 more than needed?
3.  +#define NSEC_PER_SEC (1000000000L)
Would you use NSEC_PER_SEC instead of "1000000000" in the source code
in several places?  My eyes get tired of counting the zeros.
4.  From include/linux/id2ptr.h, ID_FULL is unused.
5.  From include/linux/time.h, MAX_CLOCKS is unused.
6.  (general:) Use of "return(val);" : lose the parens.  No, it's not
mentioned in Documentation/CodingStyle, but it is the preferred style
by more than 10 to 1 in my quick research.
More tomorrow...
