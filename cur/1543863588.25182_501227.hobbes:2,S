This is what we have mlock for, no?

This sounds like we either need more fadvise hints and/or understand why
the VM doesn't behave properly.

He wants to make a nommu system act like a mmu system; this will just
never ever work. Memory fragmentation is a real issue not some gimmick
thought up by the hardware folks to sell these mmu chips.

Code looks nice, however earlier responses have raised good points. Esp.
the one pointing out you'd need to defeat swappiness too.
That said, I'm not much in favour of a limit pagecache knob.
Esp. the "my customers are scared of the 99.9% memory used scenario" is
a clear case of educate them. We don't go fix psychological problems
with code.
The only maybe valid point would be 2, and I'd like to see if we can't
solve that differently - a better use-once logic comes to mind.
