 What could cause a DMA transfer to a page with physical address below
64mb to fail ?
 Context: I am using rvmalloc code from bt848 driver in video capture
module (km, 
http://www.sf.net/projects/gatos
). The device that does the
transfer is AGP videocard (Radeon), transfer from device to main memory.
All transfers to pages with physical addresses below fail consistently.
                  thanks !
