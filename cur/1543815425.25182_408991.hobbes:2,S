I gave it a try, running the same reboot & test script for every change:
  X with "noaccel"         - no change (i.e. corruption still occur)
  X w/o kernel fb support  - no change
  X without "dri"          - no change
  w/o AGP support in kernel  - no change
  X without "fgl"          - no change
  X without "glx"          - no change
  X without "fglrx"        - no change (ATI:s driver, used vesa instead)
  X without "dbe"          - no change
  X with only 1 screen     - no change
  X w/o Dev PCI:1...       - no change
  X without "dri"          - no change
  w/o kernel DRM support   - no change
  w/PCI acess=direct       - no change
  w/o kernel SMP HT support - no change
  and finally...
  w/o kernel SMP support   - 100% ok!
  (No corruption at all after 12 x 100 x 35 x 20 megabyte writing and
   reading to ram cache)
I.e, the only thing that seem to fix this is by removing SMP (and by
doing that also HT) support :(
The processor is an Intel P4 3.4GHz w/1MB L2 cache
The graphics card is an ATI X800 using the PCI Express slot
(see my first post for more detailed info).
Perhaps worth noting: when doing repeated md5sum runs on the cached files
and discrepancies are found, it is "always" different files. I.e., the
same file will never show a bad checksum twice. A subsequent run will show
a good checksum for a file which just seconds ago had a bad one.
Of course no other programs were accessing the files during these tests.
Even though disabling kernel SMP support entirely will make this problem
go away, I seriously do not like that kind of workarounds...
Please let me know if there is more system/hardware information I could
provide to help sort this out.
