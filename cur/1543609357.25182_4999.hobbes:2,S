This is extremely architecture specific.  Some, like the x86, have a fully 
coherent architecture, so the caches snoop the bus for invalidations.  Others 
(older parisc) are completely incoherent and won't invalidate the CPU cache 
unless explicitly told to do so.
The code for all this is in:
asm/io.h for the basic dma_cache_* functions
asm/pci.h for the pci bus pci_dma_* functions
See Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt for a partial explanation of the 
implementation.

I believe (although you should take better advice from the PPC people) that 
the powerpc is completely cache coherent, so any coherency problems you may be 
having would be due to the hardware, not the kernel.
