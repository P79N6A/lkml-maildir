I think it's a good hack, but not sure about the complexity to implement
the code. I worry that if the number of tasks increase (say run into
thousands for one or more groups and a few groups have just a few
tasks), we'll lose out on accuracy.

I think we already have the code, we need to make it more useful and
reusable.
