So if you were to moint a partition on /mnt, does the mounted thing now
have to inherit permissions from / and /mnt or from it's own root or
what?
If you chroot something, does it have access to checking permissions
past it's 'virtual' root?
Can users make hardlinks themselves on netware or does an admin have to
do it?
It seems rather inefficient to have to read 8 directories worth of
permissions and calculate them together if you have a file 8 directories
deep compared to doing a single read and compare against a 16bit value +
uid/gid check (ACL of course makes this more complex, but still only
involves reading permissions in one place since inherited permissions
are for create time, not access time).
Unix offers features netware doesn't and some of them require
permissions to work a certain way.
