Reasons to support the input interface:
1) I don't know how well you understand X internals but X internals are
   based around the concept of a input device. Allows for a much better 
   design for the X server.
2) We don't have to wait 6 months for XFree86 to actually support
   the device. You have to admit kernel developement is 100 times faster
   than XFree86 developement. Look at the video cards supported in
   XF4.0. More cards are supported via fbdev than any other method with
   XF4.0 Does XF4.01 even support USB mice and keyboards yet and how long
   as USB been supported under linux? 
3) Having X run on a embedded machine will never happen. 
4) I see /dev/event like DRI. Think of computer games runing with OpenGL
   under X windows. OpenGL has a side library called glut with has things
   like joystick support. Which do you think will be faster? The OpenGL to 
   create a X network packet and send to the X server and wait for the X
   server to process the packet. Or have the glut library directly access
   /dev/event. For computer games, which drive the computer industry,
   timing is critical. In this case the kernel manages the input resources
   between OpenGL and X windows just like DRI manages the vidoe hardware
   between X windows and OpenGL.
