I wasn't speaking of driving the Linux development, I was speaking of
driving the computer technology development. Just look at where the
DOD, DARPA, DOE money goes to. I actually aknowledged that HPC doesn't
really have a foot in the kernel developer community.

Right, but that's an implementation question. The question 
  cpusets {AND, OR, XOR} CKRM ?
was basically a user space API question. I'm sure nobody will object
to changing the guts of cpusets to use sched_domains on exclusive sets
when this possibility will be there and ... simple.

I'm doing that for a subset of cpusets functionality in a module
(i.e. without touching the task structure and without hooking on
fork/exec) but that's ugly and on the long term insufficient.
