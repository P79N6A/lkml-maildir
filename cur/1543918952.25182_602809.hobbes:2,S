Hi!
Powertop tells me that irqbalance is obsolete/burns too much power,
while it is default Y and its help test does not provide any clues:
Enable kernel irq balancing (IRQBALANCE) [Y/n/?] (NEW) ?
The default yes will allow the kernel to do irq load balancing.
Saying no will keep the kernel from doing irq load balancing.
...should the help text be updated?
