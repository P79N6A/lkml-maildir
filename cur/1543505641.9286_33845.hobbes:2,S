I'm on the BT ADSL trial. It uses a standard ethernet card though I just
continued to use my own. Other people have used the supplied one with
Linux.
There has been talk of replacing the ethernet/router/adsl modem combo
with an ATM25 PCI card. I hope it's just a rumour as I haven't seen any
linux support for ATM25 cards anywhere.
