The question-mark at the end of the message indicates that it is just a
hint for some reason.  Basically the message tells you that the sound
driver expected an interrupt from the sound card, to tell it when it's
finished playing the sound, but no interrupt ever arrived.  The driver
has no idea why that might happen.
