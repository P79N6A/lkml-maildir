I don't think so. A driver might enable/disable a function multiple
times but there's no need to set the block size every time.
It may be best to move setting the block size back to before the probe
so a driver can be sure the block size is something sensible.  Consider
a failed probe that called sdio_set_block_size() -- this will currently
mess up drivers probed later.
