I've done some further testing and i discoverd that the problem was 
introduced in 2.4.3-pre3. Pre1 en pre2 are fine. I've tried disabling the 
via-ide-driver, i386 instead of athlon as build architecture with no effect. 
I've tried disabling my network-card with no effect. Ik tried reproducing the 
problem in the console using setiathome and mpg123 and i was succesfull.
So, i guess the problem is in 2.4.3-pre3 and later. I'm not a coder so there 
is not much i can do i think. If you need any information please let me know.
