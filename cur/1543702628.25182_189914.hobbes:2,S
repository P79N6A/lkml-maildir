I am still seeng the constant lockups that started with -rc2-mm1.
For the moment I have reverted to -rc1-mm1.  My setup:
Athlon XP 2500+
1 GB memory
nForce2 mobo at 333MHz FSB
If there is anything I can do to help track this down, please
let me know.  But, I am not yet much of a kernel hacker, so I
will need instruction.
