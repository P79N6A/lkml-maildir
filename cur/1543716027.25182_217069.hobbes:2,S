Oh how dearly I would love that...
I have a huge app that operates on a large file (but both are a bit
smaller than available memory, by maybe a hundred or two megs - enough
for to keep the entire working set in RAM, anyway). I create these
large files over and over (on another host, so cache does absolutely
no good whatsoever, since we are streaming a read once), but don't
delete the old ones, so they all remain in cache. So when I close one
copy of the app, and open up a new one on a different file, when it
comes time to allocate those several hundred megs, it rather blows
away my mozilla or my X session(! -- since I need it to display the
results) or my window manager, and keeps growing that cache.
