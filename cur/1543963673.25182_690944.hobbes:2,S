I do run 20+ times dd on each of the clients at the same time. Using a
single client I should be able to get it pass 1 gigabit. (The 4.5 GB
file can fit in the 32GB memory of the server so the serverdisk isn't
the bottleneck either)
Further investigation shows that:
# ethtool -k eth4
Offload parameters for eth4:
Cannot get device rx csum settings: Operation not supported
rx-checksumming: off
tx-checksumming: on
scatter-gather: on
tcp segmentation offload: off
udp fragmentation offload: off
generic segmentation offload: off
Does that seem correct?
