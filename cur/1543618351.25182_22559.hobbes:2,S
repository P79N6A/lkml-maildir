   Umm, this list just contains _freed_ page tables without
   any mappings, right ?
   
No.
   If there is some specific magic I'm missing, could you
   please point me to the code I'm overlooking ? ;)
   
Look at what get_pgd_slow() in pgalloc.h does, this is the
case where it isn't going to the cache and it is really allocating the
memory.
When the pgd comes fresh off the cache chain, it doesn't do any
of this stuff, it just gives you the cached PGD with all the PMD's
filled in already, including the kernel PMDs.
Hmmm... maybe the "we can fault on kernel mappings" thing takes
care of this because kernel PMDs can only appear, not go away.
