What version of 2.2 and 2.4 are you using here?  Be specific!  Also,
send the output of /proc/cpuinfo from both 2.2 and 2.4 along with
/proc/interrupts as well.  
Dieter> i try some parameters (noacpi noapic) without success.
And does the system pass memtest86 for an extended amount of time?
Say 24 hours?  
I ran some HP Pavillion Dual processor PPro systems for quite a while
under kernel 2.4 without major problems.  
Dieter> can you help me, to get the newer kernel running on this systems ?
Sure, just post as many details as possible.  
Do you get any output on the console when the system freezes?  You
should also look into setting up a serial console along with SysRq so
you can try to get some debugging output when the next hang happens.
