Yep.  Folks on #kernelnewbies told me about it, when there were only
changes to ``shrink_cache'' left.  So, I decided to funish mine ;)

That's why I use splay tree and not red-black or AVL-balanced one - to
exploit the locality of reference, expecting to have O(1) on average.
Of course, I decided on tree because it is hard to choose the right
hash size.

The tree is per mapping, not a single one.  Now, with 16GB cached in a
single mapping, it'd perform poorly, indeed (though probably not 20).
