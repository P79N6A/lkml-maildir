As I understand it, the tcp stack is receiving lots of SYN socket
connections and suspects it may be under a DoS (Denial of Service)
attack, so it starts using SYN cookies. These are transparent to you
and the remote user, but prevent the attack (if one is happening - if
one isn't, service will continue as normal).
How they work is something I don't know.
Personally, I would have thought this sort of thing should be a
userspace thing, but I'm no authority on the matter.
