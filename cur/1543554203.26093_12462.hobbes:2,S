The K6's don't support sysenter/sysexit.  It really should have been
marked differently before.  The early K6's used extended bit 10 to
indicate syscall/sysret capabality, but this version has some quirks
that make it pretty much unusable.  Later K6's use extended bit 11 to
indicate syscall/sysret.
