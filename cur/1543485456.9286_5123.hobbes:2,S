Is it possible to access video CD (or CD-i) data file stored on mode-2
form-2  sectors  as a normal file under Linux  kernel 2.2 ?
I know a few programs that can read and play VCD by using raw data
accessing cdrom track, but I want to read them in filesystem level
application-transparently.
"userfs" was a good solution for kernel 2.0.x but I don't know it works
in kernel 2.2 too.
I heard that there's  a block size problem of CDROM-XA sectors (they are
2324 bytes long), but I hope that transparent access to the video tracks
under Linux kernel 2.2 is possible.
