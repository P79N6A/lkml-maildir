Does/Will this driver support NICE-extensions as does the Broadcom's
driver? I've been successfully using broadcom's driver with the
nice-patched vlan-code for a couple of months now..
I think Ben Greear is about to submit NICE patch for VLAN to be included
in the kernel soon..
(NICE extensions enable hardware vlan-tagging etc for linux VLAN code).
btw. Does any other driver support NICE-extensions?
