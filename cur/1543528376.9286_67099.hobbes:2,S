If I am correct in guessing what a volatile file handle is, it sounds like the
right answer to me, that and changing the posix semantics.  What exactly is a
volatile file handle?  Does it allow a file handle to go bad and then just
relookup?  Is it an attempt to cure stale file handles?

I do.

It would be nice if you can accomodate variable length keys for the sake of what
we want to do in the future.  Our next major version will probably dump hashing
of filenames in keys and use variable length keys, so that we can do stem
compression in large directories.

Get Linux (
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS
 (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
