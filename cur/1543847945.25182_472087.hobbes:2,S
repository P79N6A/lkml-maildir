Indeed. We _have_ to re-try a failed IO that we didn't start ourselves.
The original IO could have been started by a person who didn't have 
permissions to actually carry it out successfully, so if you enter with 
the page locked (because somebody else started the IO), and you wait for 
the page and it's not up-to-date afterwards, you absolutely _have_ to try 
the IO, and can only return a real IO error after your _own_ IO has 
failed.
There is another issue too: even if the page was marked as having an error 
when we entered (and no longer locked - maybe the IO failed last time 
around), we should _still_ re-try. It might be a temporary error that has 
since gone away, and if we don't re-try, we can end up in the totally 
untenable situation where the kernel makes a soft error into a hard one. 
Neither case simply isn't acceptable. End result: only things like 
read-ahead should actually honor the "page exists but is not up-to-date" 
as a "don't even try".
