this one (and the dependent APIs utilizations) look a step in the right 
direction to me, but they are not fully consequent and thus a bit 
confusing at the moment:
- the current_clocksource is now something that is conceptually related 
  to timekeeping - while it still resides in the clocksource domain.
- if we do this split there should be a separate sysfs hierarchy for 
  timekeeping, separate of clocksource
- you use struct sys_device clocksource_sys_device from clocksource.c in 
  timekeeping.c, which is inconsistent as well.
so these bits need more work.
