I included Mr. Hedrick in this since he is the "Linux IDE Guy" and I hope
you don't mind - if so I apologize and we'll remove you.

afaik, my computer crashed because the chipset on my board (MVP3) is
flakey for non-UDMA to UDMA transfers (Dan spoke of his cdrom drive, I
have two 1-gig non-UDMA and a 17.2 gig UDMA).

My guess is that the specified 'X34' flag you enabled was either
not-supported by the drive (from man page):
	      Apart from that, use of this flag
              is  seldom  necessary  since  most/all  modern  IDE
              drives  default  to their fastest PIO transfer mode
              at power-on.  
So you may not support multiword DMA mode2 transfers.  What type of
chipset is on your motherboard?
Here's the big question (for Andre especially).  In your uniform ide patch
you state:
	Since ali15x3.c, via82c586.c, or piix.c do not have (U)DMA setup code
	started or ready for testing, if your BIOS fails to perform its task
	correctly, there is not help yet.
So am I right in saying that my bios is not initializing my (probably
via82c56) chip properly and thus will not work properly with UDMA enabled?
So there is no hope (yet) for me or for Nick?
And my second question to anyone who will answer:  Can I disable UDMA but
leave DMA enabled?  Sounds like a hdparm parameter but the -X stuff deals
with PIO modes and I don't know what I'd set to leave DMA w/o UDMA
enabled.
Sorry about all the time/confusion!
