Another thing that I would try is to tweak the /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio 
and /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio settings.
pdflush appears in your trace and with twice the RAM there is twice the 
dirty data to write out. Maybe choosing half the ratio in both settings 
with 2Gb of RAM would produce the same amount of dirty data as using 
just 1Gb of RAM with the original settings.
This is still a bug, though. This test would just give more debug 
information.
