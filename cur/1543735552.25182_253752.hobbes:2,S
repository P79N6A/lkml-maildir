It's as I thought on and off and then on again - the code checks out
ok (it's not pretty but it works) - and I seem to be getting unwanted
extra unhandled interrupts from the hardware. This driver needs a lot
of cleanup anyway - it doesn't handle these kinds of error state, nor
does it handle the removal of a mounted CompactFlash, and a dozen
other typical problems. I'll post a patch when I've solved the main
problem - moan at me by private mail if you're using this, having
similar issues, and feel like helping.
Jon.
