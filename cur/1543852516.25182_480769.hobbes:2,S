Jens (or anybody else who has any idea of how to debug this),
Did you have a chance to reproduce the problem? I guess we "only" need a
machine with SATA/ata_piix and cdparanoia 3.10. If you want me to debug
some stuff, feel free to tell me what. But, since it freezes the machine
and sysrq doesn't even work, I don't really know what to try...
I just tried on rc5 and rc5-mm1, both have the problem (as 2.6.16, .17
and .18 do, don't know about earlier kernels). I didn't have a audio CD
here, so I tried abcde on a DVD on purpose. With cdparanoia 3.10-pre0
(from Debian testing), it reports nothing during about 5 seconds and
then the machine freezes. With cdparanoia 3a9.8-11 (from Debian stable),
it reports an error very quickly, and dmesg gets a couple line like these:
    sg_write: data in/out 12/12 bytes for SCSI command 0x43--guessing
data in;
       program cdparanoia not setting count and/or reply_len properly
Thanks,
Brice
