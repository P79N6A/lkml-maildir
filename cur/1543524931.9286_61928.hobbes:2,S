I'm *very* intrested in any performance numbers for Linux used in this
role.
Right now, if you look at big, fast, networking gear, it's *VERY*
expensive and not very featureful. Many of them don't even support IPv6,
much less firewalling. :)
Functionally, a Linux box with a gig card, 802.1q and connected to a
switch, makes a *VERY* inexpensive and featurful multiport router. Though,
I have no idea how it performs. Of course it will be slower then the
hardware based solutions.
But that might be better then being stuck with expensive equipment that
becomes a boat ancor as soon as you need IPv6 or other features.
