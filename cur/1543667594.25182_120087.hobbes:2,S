Can you give me the details? I can
imagine holes like "if I can force root
to rm -rf /tmp/my-dir while my scripts
are running, I can rm whatever I want"
and probably could force root to cp
files he did not want to copy, but that
would require a *lot* of social ingeneering...
Unlike ptrace which seems to be "gimme root, now!"
case.
