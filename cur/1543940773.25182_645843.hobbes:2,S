Weird.  psmouse-base.c builds ok for me.  Perhaps there is a compiler
version difference?  I'm running a rather old 3.4.6 that came with
my RHEL 4.5 release.

New section mismatch checks are complaining about lots of stuff in this
post 2.6.24 world.  There are a couple of dozen other warnings in a
"normal" build.

Yup ... my script is a little different.  It uses
	$ sed -e '/CONFIG_SMP/d' arch/ia64/configs/tiger_defconfig > .config
	$ make oldconfig
But the net effect should be equivalent.

Some place in there.  The CONFIG_SMP=n path in ia64 makes quite radical
changes ... rather than putting all the per-cpu stuff into the top 64K
of address space and providing a per-cpu TLB mapping for that range to a
different physical address ... it just makes all the per-cpu stuff link
as ordinary variables in .data.  The error messages indicate that some of
the new code is unaware of this.
