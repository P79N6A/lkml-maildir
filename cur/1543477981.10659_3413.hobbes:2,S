Subject: procfs and conditional compilation removal.

I see that the last patches have removed some of the conditional
compilation for procfs, e.g.:
[...]
-#ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS
 static struct proc_dir_entry *proc_fbmem;
-#endif
[...]
I see that proc_fs.h contain void inline functions so I guess the idea is
to remove the conditional directives from the code and compile it with
void inlines that can be optimized away by the compiler.
The data structures can not be optimized away so that they eat up some
memory (68 bytes for a single proc_dir_entry or 4 (or 8) bytes for a
pointer to it ... not really much).
Now the question.
I have grepped the code for CONFIG_PROC_FS and I have found that still 120
files contain that conditional directives.
If CONFIG_PROC_FS cleanup is something desired I can do it. Only I want to
know if this is something really desired before 2.2.0.
Ciao,
	Riccardo.
