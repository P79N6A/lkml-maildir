Hi list,
         Can someone share the big endian port for the PCI ISDN card 
driver ?Currently it prints the statement:
#*error* "not running on *big endian* machines now"
This line is present in drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc_pci.c
If the port is not available can someone suggest/show pointers for the 
guidelines to port for bigendian.
Thanks in advance.
cheers-
kaushal.
