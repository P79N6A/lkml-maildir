Hmmm. This is what I have enabled under "Kernel hacking":
#
# Kernel hacking
#
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT=y
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
# CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is not set
# CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO is not set
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y
# CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER is not set
CONFIG_X86_EXTRA_IRQS=y
CONFIG_X86_FIND_SMP_CONFIG=y
CONFIG_X86_MPPARSE=y
So far, though, not a single problem -- I was playing Flash animations while
printing a huge document without a single hiccup (I have an HP DeskJet 880C with
very little memory, so there was a lot of in-kernel activity).
