If so - I would still like to put it in:
 - ifdef CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK
 - and define as __init
so that people don't use it when they shouldn't (when the kernel is up an 
running).
Something simple like - early_copy_log_buff(void *dest, size_t n) 
copies n bytes from log_buf to memory area dest. Returns number of bytes that 
could not be copied. Can find out how many bytes are in the log_buff by 
calling with zero size.
This is not destructive to existing interfaces (log_start and con_start are 
not updated/used). This should ensure that if booting does work - that normal 
messages come out the standard method.
Any other suggestions?
