[root@coyote linux-2.6.22.1-rt6]# grep CONFIG_IDE .config
CONFIG_IDE=y
# CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE is not set
# CONFIG_IDE_TASK_IOCTL is not set
CONFIG_IDE_PROC_FS=y
CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC=y
# CONFIG_IDEPCI_SHARE_IRQ is not set
CONFIG_IDEPCI_PCIBUS_ORDER=y
# CONFIG_IDEDMA_ONLYDISK is not set
# CONFIG_IDE_ARM is not set
# CONFIG_IDE_CHIPSETS is not set
# CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB is not set
