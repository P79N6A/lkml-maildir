Could be that despite what it appears, FIFO behaviour may be desirable 
to RR. Also the RR in SCHED_ISO is pretty fast at 10ms. However with 
nothing else really running it just shouldn't matter...

That's one distinct possiblity. Preempt code is a particular problem.
You are not running into the cpu limits of SCHED_ISO so something else 
must be responsible. If we are higher priority than everything else and 
do no expire in any way there is no reason we shouldn't perform as well 
as SCHED_FIFO.
There is some sort of privileged memory handling when jackd is running 
as root as well, so I don't know how that features here. I can't imagine 
it's a real issue though.
