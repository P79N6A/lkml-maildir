The memory saving is usually modest: 4k per thread. It might make a 
difference for
those with many thousands of threads.   I believe this is unswappable 
memory,
which is much more valuable than ordinary process memory.
More interesting is that it removes one way for fork() to fail. With 8k 
stacks,
the new process needs to allocate two consecutive pages for those 8k.  That
might be impossible due to fragmentation, even if there are megabytes of 
free
memory. Such a problem usually only shows up after a long time.  Now we 
only need to
allocate a single page, which always works as long as there is any free 
memory at all.

Consider the case when your server (web/mail/other) fails to fork, and then
you can't login because that requires fork() too.  4k stacks remove this 
scenario,
and is a stability improvement.
