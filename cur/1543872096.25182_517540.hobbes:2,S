By that argument we could just codify every ruleset and put it in the
kernel. Its three simple rules. There is no chance I'm going to take
this part.

I'm guessing xt_portscan tries to detect and match on portscans, but
its not obvious why it looks at and changes skb->mark and nfct->ctmark,
so I suggest you start by explaining what it really does.

I'd rather not add hacks to mildly annoy people anywhere.

The question is what we gain by being able to detect portscans.
So far my opinion is thats its close to nothing. Besides that,
it should be possible to do this by using the recent match.
