What I need is a list of (mm, va) that map the page.  kvm doesn't have 
access to that, export notifiers do.  It seems reasonable that export 
notifier do that rmap walk since they are part of core mm, not kvm.
Alternatively, kvm can change its internal rmap structure to be page 
based instead of (mm, hva) based.  The problem here is to size this 
thing, as we don't know in advance (when the kvm module is loaded) 
whether 0% or 100% (or some value in between) of system memory will be 
used for kvm.
