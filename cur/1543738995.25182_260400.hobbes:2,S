It's worth adding that the reason why programs are often built with
-fomit-frame-pointer is for overhead reduction on stack frames, to
make the binary slightly smaller and run maybe a bit faster so it's
become quite popular. This discussion is beyond the scope of the
original mail, but worthy of noting - and it ends up going down the
path of differences between architectures, so let's just leave it at
this clarification.
Jon.
