I have various random x86 binaries that do not work.
My 32bit x86 user space does not run.
A 32bit kernel doesn't have a chance.
So for me at least the 32bit support is not useful in avoiding
converting binaries.  For the handful of apps that cannot be
recompiled I suspect the support is good enough so you can get them
to run somehow.
