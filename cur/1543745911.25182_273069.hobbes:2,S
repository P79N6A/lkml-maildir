FHS says that the kernel image can be in either / or /boot. However, older 386'
require that extra partition below 1024 cyls.
Plus, I am of the opinion that there should not be any files in /
(incircumventable exception are quota files); ls -l already shows 57 entries
for this machine's root dir.
>If /boot is ok for other than just i386 we can give it a try.
boot is always ok given that you copy the kernel from the source tree to <your
favorite destination> by hand.
