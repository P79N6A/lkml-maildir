Ah.. another one, that I was just reminded of again
by the umpteenth person posting that their wireless
no longer is WPA capable after upgrading from 2.6.12.
Of course, the known solution for that issue is to

daemon in userspace, since the old one no longer works.
Things like this are all too regular an occurance.
