Why do you think we get a deadlock or leak? AFAICS if the user turns off
mandatory locks on the file, then the existing locks default back into
advisory locks which use the same notification mechanism as the
mandatory locks.
IOW: the process that is waiting in locks_mandatory_area() will be
released as soon as the advisory lock is dropped. If that theory is
broken in practice, then that is the bug that we need to fix. We neither
want to add a load of locking crap to notify_change(), nor should we
need to.
