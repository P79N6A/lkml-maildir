Hi all,
      I am trying to implement per process LDT for
linux-2.4.20 on IA-32. During booting the kernel
does'nt get past the invocation of /sbin/init.
      I have made the following changes for my
implementation
1) Have added segment descriptors for User code and
data in the newly created segment in the function 
"copy_segments".
2)changed the __USER_CS and USER_DS to point into the
new descriptors created above.
   Could anyone suggest where i  had gone wrong??
TIA
gum
