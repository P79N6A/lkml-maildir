OK this is pretty nice.  But you just missed out because the
GCM patches that just went in added more hexdump uses :)
So could you please refresh your patch against the latest cryptodev
tree? Please also clamp those long lines to 80 characters.
On an unrelated note, lib/hexdump.c should not print 8-bit text
even though they pass the is_print test.  They just turn up as
crap on Unicode terminals.
Thanks,
