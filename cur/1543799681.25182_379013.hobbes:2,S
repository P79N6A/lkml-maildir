rusage_both is called at various places in exit.c, all of which are in
turn called from sys_wait4 through do_wait. They pass a user space
rusage struct pointer and expect the results to be copied there.
Similarly, rusage_self and rusage_children are called from sysirix.c
which also seemingly passes a user space pointer to them. Hence, the
copy to user in all three functions.
