Well, I've seen it as a symlink, but then you are not supposed to
recompile out of /usr/src/linux ... that was why, I assumed, Linus
suggested everyone compile there kernels out of /home in the last
discussion about this.
Admittedly it should not be linked, but I think it is often enough - the
same rule stands: don't change the src without recompiling glibc.
