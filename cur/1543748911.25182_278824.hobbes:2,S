There's no high level overview, AFAIK. But there are many documents
out there, describing various parts of Linux. Many of them are
outdated, but you can get an idea, how Linux works.
Linux Kernel 2.4 Internals <
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lki/>
Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide <
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/khg/>
Linux Memory Management: <
http://www.linux-mm.org/>
The Linux Kernel API <
http://kernelnewbies.org/documents/kdoc/kernel-api/linuxkernelapi.html>
The Linux Kernel (based on 2.0.33) <
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/tlk/>
and all below linux/Documentation, of course. However, if you want to
learn about the current state of Linux, you won't get around reading
the source.
Regards, Olaf.
