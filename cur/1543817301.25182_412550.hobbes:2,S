What I thought was just one patch was actually two and it was the
other patch causing the problem - "Do not lose accepted socket when
-ENFILE/-EMFILE".
Most of the patch seems to be just a restructuring - I guess that
leaves the sys_accept changes that are leaking the memory. 
I've no idea how the code is supposed to work, so large rocks of salt
required :-)  The code now does a sock_alloc_fd, and the error cases
now do a "put_filp" and "put_unused_fd" if the alloc succeeded.
However in the normal case, nothing gets freed (I guess that's the
memory leak).  OTOH the description of the patch is:
 "Try to allocate the struct file and an unused file
 descriptor before we try to pull a newly accepted
 socket out of the protocol layer."
