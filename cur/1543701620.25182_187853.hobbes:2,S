yes

yes. So what - how does it help? User needs /dev/sda4. User has /dev/sda only. 
Any attempt to refer to /dev/sda4 simply returns "No such file or directory"

this worked seamlessly using static /dev. This worked seamlessly using devfs. 
If it won't work with udev - it means regression. And believe me - it is 
serious regression for end-users (I still remember similar problems we had 
when transitioning to devfs and users' reaction to this).

You miss the point. When should this script be run? There is no event when you 
just insert Jaz disk; nor is there any way to trigger revalidation on access 
to non-existing device like is the case without udev.
what I aim at - udev needs to provide some extension mechanism to allow 
arbitrarily scripts to be run. Such script could then create all block nodes 
(hmm ... how can script know the number of possible nodes and their names?)
in hope somebody gets an idea ...
