From a memory consumption POV, it's definitely a win to reuse the ->page
member as a pointer to the next sgtable. I didn't do that originally to
avoid complications in allocating and setting up the sg table, but I may
very well reconsider that decision soonish.
We can easily change this without disturbing the upper layers, so it's
not a big deal to change now or later.
