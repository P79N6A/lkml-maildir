What I mean is that in a binary rpm you have binaries which link 
together GPL and non GPL code. There's not such a thing as a GPL 
binaries to put in the GPL directory. This holds true whether they play 
tricks or not. If you want to see the GPL'd code you must download the
source package.
You may blame them for playing tricks with \0 character, but you can't 
blame them for an empty GPL directory in the binary package, when you 
find it properly populated in the source package.
