No idea about sysrq, i don't use it. However, I haven't experienced any
such problem with the various G5s we have here (and no other G5 user
reported such a problem).
So it would be useful if you could provide a bit more informations here
though. For example, what exact G5 model is this, do you have any 3rd
party PCI card, what video card are you using, can you reproduce the
crash in console mode, that sort of thing ...
Also, did you run a memtest equivalent on the machine ?
Finally, it would be useful if you could point out which specific patch
or bk snapshot, or at least -mm rev. introduced the bug. As I said
previously, you are the only one to report that and none of the G5s here
is showing such a problem.
Ben.
