It looks like every place wbc->nonblocking is set to 1, sync_mode
is set to WB_SYNC_NONE, but there are places where WB_SYNC_NONE is
used and nonblocking is NOT set: 
	balance_dirty_pages()
	try_to_unuse()
So your patch makes balance_dirty_pages() do the lock_buffer()
in __block_write_full_page() instead of skipping and redirtying
the page.
I just making sure I understand.
So, WB_SYNC_ALL and nonblocking=1 should never be used?
