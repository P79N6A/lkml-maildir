Or you are running some kind of cluster where you want the
applications to be checkpointed transparently without the application
knowing the details of how or when they will be swapped out (but this
will need sockets anyway, so won't happen anytime soon).
'Tis a pain that the alpha cluster here can suspend long running jobs
for a pile of smaller jobs, and then resume, but the linux cluster can
do no such fanciness (yes, we do manual checkpointing, but it's prone
to bugs - and finding such a bug after 30 days of compute time really
sucks balls).
