Linus,
Here is a patch that fixes the problem of attaching to IrLAN
devices in Linux-2.4.1. 
The problem was that the IrLAN driver forgot to memorize the
hardware address of the remote device and instead used the
broadcast address, which sometimes did work, but not always
(since doing so is actually a bug)
Have also added the dynalloc flag to irlan, since it does 
allocate it's network devices dynamically.
