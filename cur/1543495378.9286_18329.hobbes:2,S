In one operating system I knew well (IBM's VM) control never passed out of
the dump process. IBM 370/390 hardware uses channel command words and has
basic commands SIO (start i/o)to start the activity and TIO (test I/O)
which can be used for completion checking. There are less basic ways which
allow overlap, of course. The DASD area is pre-formatted, so the channel
commands were very simple. During the process, if an unexpected interrupt
occured the dump process would stop. (Machine check, for example).
In an MP environment, the other processor(s) would be SIGP'd to stop all
work during the dump.
Linux would need a "non-operating system" mode of operation to proceed
succesfully. Sounds tough but not impossible.
