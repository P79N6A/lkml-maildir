	Am I experiencing unique crash w.r.t. partition check?
	It crashes
	        if (!(bh = bread(dev,0,get_ptable_blocksize(dev)))) {
	                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	                printk(" unable to read partition table\n");
	                return -1;
	        }
	Here. Actual crash is in get_hash_table, path is getblk, bread,
	findkey (??!), check_partition. It is present from 2.3.18ac10.
Hmm. Interesting. Probably this is not the bug I mentioned earlier.
(But the partition reading code messes in a somewhat silly way with
devices, creating them just to read one block and then deleting them
again. Could it be that something went wrong with an earlier bforget()?
Or maybe this is what Andre knew how to fix?)
