Subject: announce: updated autofs v4 patches; autofs-4.0.0-pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've updated the autofs v4 patch for 2.2.14 and 2.3.40.  This fixes some edge
cases I found in testing since the previous release.
Autofs v4 extends the autofs functionality by implementing tree mounts, so that
entire trees of filesystems can be automounted rather than since filesystems;
this allows you to have a Solaris-style /net.
Autofs patches and the autofs-4.0.0-pre1 daemon are available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/daemons/autofs/testing-v4
 or
http://www.goop.org/~jeremy/autofs.
There are two patches for 2.3: autofs4-2.3.40-20000123 and
autofs-2.3.40-20000123.  The former adds a completely new filesystem called
"autofs4", and leaves the existing autofs code intact.  The latter replaces the
existing autofs v3 filesystem with the autofs v4 filesystem.  They are
functionally identical.
Autofs v4 is completely backwards compatible with autofs v3 (the old v3 daemon
will work fine with the v4 kernel code).
