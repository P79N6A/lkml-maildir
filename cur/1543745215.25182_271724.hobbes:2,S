I am not all certain that there really is a correlation like this. It might
have been coincidence. This boot locked again when i was in X for 1 minute
for checking mails. So again no console output.
I will change the keyboard IRQ handler back to prio 99. Maybe sysrq is
usable then..
Will stay on the console from now until next lockup to see if i get anything
out of sysrq (although the 50 lines vga console is probably of limited use
here).
