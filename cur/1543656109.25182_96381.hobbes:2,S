I remember the mail you were referring to but I don't have any knowledge 
regarding whether this specific patch is good or bad.
It's often better to reject bad code and to have nothing in the kernel 
instead of having bad code in the kernel. There are several examples 
where bad code entered into the kernel and it would have been better if 
it was rejected.
You might discuss whether the code in question is "crap" or good code 
but please discuss it on a technical level without personal offences.
