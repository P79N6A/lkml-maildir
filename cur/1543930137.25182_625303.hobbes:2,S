Earlier you said that you need to be able to tell git when you want to make
a commit, which means pretty much any old filesystem could serve as gitfs.
Now you're saying you want every single update to be committed, which would
make it mimic an editor's undo functionality. I still don't get what it is
you really want.

That's exactly what's happening today. I imagine whoever wrote the gitfs
thing did so to facilitate testing, or as some form of intellectual
masturbation.
So, to get to the bottom of this, which of the following workflows is it you
want git to support?
### WORKFLOW A ###
edit, edit, edit
edit, edit, edit
edit, edit, edit
Oops I made a mistake and need to hop back to "current - 12".
edit, edit, edit
edit, edit, edit
publish everything, similar to just tarring up your workdir and sending out
### END WORKFLOW A ###
### WORKFLOW B ###
edit, edit, edit
ok this looks good, I want to save a checkpoint here
edit, edit, edit
looks good again. next checkpoint
edit, edit, edit
oh crap, back to checkpoint 2
edit, edit, edit
ooh, that's better. save a checkpoint and publish those checkpoints
### END WORKFLOW B ###
If you could just answer that question and stop writing "transparent" or
any synonym thereof six times in each email, we can possibly help you.
As it stands now though, nobody is very interested because you haven't
explained how you want this "transparency" of yours to work in an every
day scenario.
