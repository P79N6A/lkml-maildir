It did not happen when I was running that kernel, but I had only run it for a 
couple of times.  It generally does not happen with this one either.  It's 
happened only once and I reported it immediately.  But ...
... I saw something very similar on 2.6.7-rc1 and I'm now looking at the log 
(attached - it's partially corrupted, because /var was on /dev/sdb5 that 
failed too).  The hardware configuration was similar to the current one, 
AFAIR.
Well, it looks like the whole SCSI bus sometimes goes south for some reason 
and it may very well be a hardware problem that manifests itself in such a 
(strange?) way.  Or not.  Anyway, it certainly had not happened on this 
hardware _before_ 2.6.7-rc1.
I have no idea what to do to make it happen again (suggestions welcome).
