The entire concept of geometry is a a carryover from days gone by. 
These days it is just a farse maintained for backwards compatibility. 
You can put fdisk into sector mode with the 'u' command and create 
partitions of any number of sectors you desire, regardless of the 
perceived geometry.

I don't believe you need to do anything; md will simply not use the few 
extra sectors at the end of the larger disk/partition and round down to 
the appropriate size.

Yes, it slows things down.  You want to try to match disk speeds as 
closely as possible for best performance.

Theoretically yes, more time will be spent sending the data across the 
bus twice, but most systems have enough spare capacity there that you 
probably won't notice.
