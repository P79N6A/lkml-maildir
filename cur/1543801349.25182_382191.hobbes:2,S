Please hold, should be fixed.

Meanwhile, the whole content of the new free_winch(), including some syscalls 
on the host, and various other stuff, is brought back under the 
winch_handler_lock.
And this without notice, which means that possibly the author didn't notice 
this. A note "I brought things back under the lock because it was dumb" would 
have made me happier...
I had carefully brought that stuff out keeping only the list access under the 
lock, probably while fixing some "scheduling while atomic" warnings - once 
the element is out of the list it's unreachable thus (IMHO) safely 
accessible.
I'm thinking to some scenarios to verify if this is as true as it seems...
So, list_del should be brought out from free_winch, which would then become 
callable without the spinlock held.
