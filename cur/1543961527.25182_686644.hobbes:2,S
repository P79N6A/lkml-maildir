2.6.25-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Steven Toth <stoth@hauppauge.com>
(cherry picked from commit 6b92b3bd7ac91b7e255541f4be9bfd55b12dae41)
This patch fixes an issue on the HVR1300, where GPIO is blown away due to
the radio input being undefined, breaking the functionality of the DVB
demodulator and MPEG2 encoder used on the cx8802 mpeg TS port.
This is a minimal patch for 2.6.26 and the -stable series.  This must be
fixed a better way for 2.6.27.
