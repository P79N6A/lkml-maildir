I appear to be missing something.  What do PCI synchonization issues
have anything to do with a driver giving the OS hints?  The delivery
of interrupts to the handlers would not change, but only that messages
*might* get printk'd if an interrupt occurs and no handler thinks that
the interrupt belongs to it.  How often do spurious interrupts occur
in a correctly functioning computer that shares interrupts between,
say, a NIC and SCSI card?
One thing that you could do with the I_DID_SOME_STUFF flag is use the
statistics to reorder the execution of interrupt handlers so that the
device that causes the most interrupts gets called first.  Might be
cool, difficult to tell.
