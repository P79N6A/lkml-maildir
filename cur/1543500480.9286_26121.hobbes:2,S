That's a fine idea; but *why* would you want to show a *different* value
than the allocated blocks to a directory?  What would you get if it
would show (for example) how many entries are in there?  You can tell
that pretty easily with ls itself..
Think about it, now at least you *know* how much space a directory takes,
and at least *know* what takes up enormous space, and why access in that
directory is slow, so you can fix it.
