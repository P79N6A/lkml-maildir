I haven't done either.  I have booted linux in the following manner (no OS
is installed at this point).
1.  Turn on Computer
2.  Put CD in while RAM is counting
3.  view slackware boot prompt
4.  press enter
5.  watch kernel messages scroll by.
6.  format disks
7.  -- errors --
Any other ideas?  The disk is less than a year old.

If you launched out of Windows to install Linux, DON'T do that.
If you have booted into Linux from Windows, DON'T do that.
I can fix a lot of things that MS does to the ATA-Bridge/Chipset but I do
not like to go dorking int the PCI/ISA bridges to fix up issues.
