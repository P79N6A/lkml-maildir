This example is only being used as a proof by example that it is impossible
to create a mechanism for process migration which is completly transparent
for applications.  That is in some cases like the migration of network
resources the application has to get involved.  Depending of the
implementation a nice side effect is that application will become more
tolerant against network failures.
