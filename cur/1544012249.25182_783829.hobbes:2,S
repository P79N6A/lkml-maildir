Well the testing infrastructure simply flagged a problem that
was always there.  Previously if something used AES early enough
it would silently give the wrong result instead.  Of course this
is fairly unlikely since the number of AES users is limited.
Now that the testing infrastructure is available, we could just
do nothing for 2.6.28 since the C AES version will always be there
and work correctly.
Thanks,
