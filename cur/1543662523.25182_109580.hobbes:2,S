Yes.
We could register the device also in other cases (!PM, SMP)
but the methods would then be nullified and we'd have a device
node with a name but no operations. I could do that, I just
think it's pointless.
Getting suspend to work on SMP is a separate project. This
patch is just about upgrading to the new infrastructure.
