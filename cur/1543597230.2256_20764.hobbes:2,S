This is due to two files sharing the same inode number, which isn't supposed
to happen.  You can find the two files by doing a find -inum 393750 on the
filesystem.  You probably want to grab the latest reiserfsck from
ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs/pre and check the entire FS.
The only known way to trigger this problems involves running an older version
of reiserfsck --rebuild-tree.  Have you done that?
