Yes, and for completeness :
accept2(int fd, ...)
pipe2(int *fds, int oflags);
eventfd2(int count, int oflags);
signalfd2(int ufd, sigset_t __user *user_mask, size_t sizemask, int oflags);
timerfd2(int ufd, int clockid, int flags,const struct itimerspec __user *utmr, int oflags) ...
We probably should name those with a better sufix than "2", it is ugly.
