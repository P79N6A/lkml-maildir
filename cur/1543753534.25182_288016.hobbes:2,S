They do to "break all existing exploits" until someone takes 5 minutes
to make a slight alteration.  Only the reciprocating combinations of
each protection can protect the others from being exploited and create a
truly secure environment.
Ingo said there's other stuff in ES that this doesn't apply to but
*shrug* again, beyond what I intended when I said that.

Manually.  Annoying because now I'm doing PaX AND Exec Shield markings,
but I do remark them anyway.  This wasn't meant to sound like it was a
major problem, just to be a side comment.

I don't want to run something potentially dangerous.  Think secret
military installation with no name and blank checks made out to nobody.
 The security has to scale up and down; it has to be useful for the home
user, for the business, and for those that don't officially exist.

True, but PaX has a failsafe in PAGEEXEC, and doesn't suffer this in
SEGMEXEC.

The actual threat this mitigates is that the app may be ret2libc'd to
mprotect() (possible with unrandomized ET_EXEC?), but in reality a more
complex attack can accomplish the same thing.  I prefer it more as a
speed bump to expose broken code to me or at least give me an idea of
what to audit.  If something HAS to mprotect() the stack, then I HAVE to
make sure that program is audited, or I'm just being a dumbass and
waiting to be infected with a cheap worm some scriptkiddie wrote using a
build-your-own-virus program.
