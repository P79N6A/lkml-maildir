The function is identical to the one for pSeries, and I'd
prefer to have only one copy of it with a more generic name.
Actually, it looks like maple and perhaps pmac have a very
similar *_calibrate_decr function, so I could perhaps
just put this into time.c as generic_calibrate_decr().
[ Ben, can you tell if pSeries_calibrate_decr should work on
  all G5 macs or if it can be changed to support them as well? ]
On a similar issue, I just remembered that I wanted to
create a rtas_time.c to hold the rtc access functions
for pSeries and BPA. Do you think that's a good idea?
