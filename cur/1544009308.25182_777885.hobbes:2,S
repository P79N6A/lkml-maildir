Are you two people or just two names and email addresses for
the same ?
/dev/console is a logical mapping to a device which may well be
different, loaded after PCI is initialised and dependant on PCI.

Yes. They won't boot if you don't include any disk drivers. They won't
boot if you don't include any file systems. They wont boot in a million
other cases. That is the user space not the kernel at fault.
The kernel is doing precisely what it is supposed to. It is even logging
the user space bug and stopping trying to get stuck in a loop loading a
module in order to attempt to cope with the user space bug.
If you want to complain then file a debian bug, go fix the user space.
