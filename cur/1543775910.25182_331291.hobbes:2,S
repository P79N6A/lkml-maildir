Why is it that /proc does not use an ioctl?  Use of metafiles could
allow eliminating ioctl(), which most folks I know hate as an
interface.  Wouldn't it be cleaner if we could find out what ioctl()s
are supported by a given file using ls filename/..../ioctl?
Excerpt from the ioctl man page, which lacks a list of what features are
implemented or how to find out.
CONFORMING TO
       No single standard.  Arguments, returns, and semantics of
ioctl(2) vary
       according to the device driver in question  (the  call  is  used 
as  a
       catch-all  for  operations  that  don't cleanly fit the Unix
stream I/O
       model). See ioctl_list(2) for a list of many of the known ioctl 
calls.
       The ioctl function call appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix.
