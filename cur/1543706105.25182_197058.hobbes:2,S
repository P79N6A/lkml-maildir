E aí Marcelo.
It isn't a new release, really. It's his last patch, released
16 October 2002. All earlier were merged.
I don't know what it fixes besides what's listed at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103474534430016&w=2
. Probably that's all.
He's the expert, but I recall he told me there were important
fixes, and I've been using it since then without any noticeable
problems on all later 2.4 kernels. It only changes code in
fs/devfs/base.c and include/linux/devfs_fs_kernel.h.
I'm just surprised it never made into. Maybe Al Viro or Andrey
Borzenkov will want to review it :-)
And Andrey (he's cleaning up devfs in 2.6) may be able to tell
you if
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2003-25/0100.html
is still needed.
