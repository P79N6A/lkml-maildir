Sorry to interrupt.
I have had a look at the code and looked around a bit and I'm left with 
two questions.
1) What are the problems with devfs. I can't seem to find anything 
specific?
2) I believe udev does not support for an increased number of anonymous 
devices for such things as NFS and autofs mounts. I can't see anything in 
the kernel (2.6) to improve this either. Can devfs provide improvements 
for this without to much pain?
