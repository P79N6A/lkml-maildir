So,  only AUX ports  can be  directly accessed?   No direct  access to
keyboard port?  Why?
The  SERIO_USERDEV  patch  does  allow  direct access  to  the  PC  AT
keyboard, and it did help me  locate the SysRq problem that I reported
in  other postings.   i.e.  it IS  useful  to be  able  to access  the
keyboard port directly.

1) there is no RAW access to the keyboard port;
2) I   hate  this   black  magic,   in  which   the   input  "devices"
   (i.e. drivers)  kidnap the serio  ports they like according  to the
   port  type SERIO_8042_RAW, etc.   That's a  kind of  hardcoding the
   binding between ports and drivers.
Isn't it better to leave the AUX ports as SERIO_8042, and let the user
dynamically change  this port<-->driver binding?  Then,  we don't even
need  that ugly  "i8042.raw" boot  parameter or  i8042_aux_raw option.
The  user can  decide  which  ports are  connected  to your  serio_raw
driver, and which ports are  connected to psmouse.ko.  That would also
allow multiple drivers driving the ports of the same type.
