Hello Randy,
we checked your patch and it works as you expected, only it is not what we are
looking for. We would like to be able to make _one_ kernel, that can be used on
boards with PS/2 keyboard or USB keyboard, but without a PS/2 keyboard check
that takes as long as it does in current version (and gives _one_ warning, but
not tens).
Do you think this is solvable?
