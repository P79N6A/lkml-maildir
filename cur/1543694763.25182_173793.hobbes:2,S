Re the new framebuffer code, it appears to not work on matroxfb.
On bootup the console gets as far as:
...
found SMP MP-table at 000f4db0
hm, page 000f4000 reserved twice.
And then it stops, whereas normally the framebuffer would kick in with a pengiun and continue booting.
I boot the kernel with "video=matroxfb:vesa:0x192". When I disable it with "video=matroxfb:off" the system
boots fine.
