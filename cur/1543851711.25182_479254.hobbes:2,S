Sorry, there were no units in the per-patch fork and clone data. Units
there are in tasks created per second. The kernbench units are in place
and should be fairly self-explanatory I think.
Here's what I did:
Measure the time it takes to fork N times. Retry 100 times. Try
different N. Try clone instead of fork to see how different the results
can be.
Then run kernbench.
Do the above after applying each patch. Then compare to the previous
patch (or unpatched source).
Run statistics on the numbers.

	Well, it's a worst-case scenario. Without the patches I've seen the
fork rate intermittently (once every 300 samples) drop to 16k forks/sec
-- a much bigger drop than 2%. I also ran the tests on Andrew's hotfix
patches for rc2-mm2 and got similar differences even though the patches
don't change the fork path. And finally, don't forget to compare that to
the error -- about +/-1.6%. So on an absolute worst-case workload we
could have a drop anywhere from 0.4 to 3.6%.
	To get a better idea of the normal impact of these patches I think you
have to look at benchmarks more like kernbench since it's not comprised
entirely of fork calls. There the measurements are easily within the
error margins with or without the patches.
	Unfortunately the differences I get always seem to be right around the
size of the error. I can't seem to get a benchmark to have an error of
1% or less. I'm open to suggestions of different benchmarks or how to
obtain tighter bounds on the measurements (e.g. /proc knobs to fiddle
with).

	It's nice to see a module's init function with the rest of the module
and not cluttering up the kernel's module loading code. The use,
benefits, disadvantages, and even the implementation of task watchers
are similar. I could rename it (task_init(), task_exit(), etc.) to make
the similarity more apparent.

I'm open to suggestions on how to improve the performance. :)

	Well, it should make things look cleaner. It's also intended to be
useful in new code like containers and resource management -- pieces
many people don't want to pay attention to in those paths.
