Hi,
I have a python application that kills X. I.e. the X process terminates, 
and all X programs receive broken links to the display and therefore 
also exit.
The problem is, this python application is not supposed to kill 
anything, so I think it is a bug in X, but I cannot find any way to 
trace the fault. Even gdb says the application was killed, so exited 
normally, and results in no back trace.
Is there any way in Linux to find out who did the "killing" ?
James
