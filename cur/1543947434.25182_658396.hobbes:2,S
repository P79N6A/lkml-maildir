From: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>
patch 66191dc622f5ff0a541524c4e96fdacfacfda206 in mainline.
Turn off quotas before filesystem is remounted read only.  Otherwise quota
will try to write to read-only filesystem which does no good...  We could
also just refuse to remount ro when quota is enabled but turning quota off
is consistent with what we do on umount.
