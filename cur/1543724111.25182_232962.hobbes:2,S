Nope. char is either an unsigned char or a signed char, which one is up to
the implementation, and the three types are distinct. The signed keyword
was introduced exactly for the corner case of an explicitly signed (not
unsigned, and not maybe signed) char.

Not an extension, in C for ever and ever.

Right. Look at the standard, and then go back and rewrite to agree with C99
all the "standard conforming" C you have written. Should keep you away from
LKML for a while...
