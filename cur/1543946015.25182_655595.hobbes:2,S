Subject: [PATCH] arch/sh/drivers/heartbeat.c ioremap is expected to succeed

!unlikely(hd->base) is equivalent to likely(!hd->base) (for instance see
comments with commit fd312561adcc90e924f35d3032d5493aeb4c3017), I think
the ioremap is expected to succeed? please confirm that's right.
The patch below was *not* tested.
