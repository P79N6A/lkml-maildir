Is this necessary, or just convenient?  I can see how it would be

Ok...  This implies that my comments on the last patch were valid.  I
like this model.  Assume the unused bits aren't set, and take care not
to set them.  I'm happy to see this spelled out explicitly.

bitmap_and() & bitmap_or() *do not* mask off the unused input bits. 
Unless you add that code in a subsequent patch...  This paragraph seems
a bit unclear.  You're saying that bitmap_and() & bitmap_or() *don't*
follow the precondition, but *do* mask off unused bits, which I'm not
seeing.  Then the 'however' is confusing, because you continue with the
same point about *not* following preconditions.  Maybe something like:
"The underlying bitmap.c operations such as bitmap_and() and bitmap_or()
don't follow this model of 'unused bits'.  Users must follow the
precondition that unused bits are zero to guarantee no unused bits are
set by the operations.  Further, the underlying bitop.h operations, such
as set_bit() and clear_bit(), do no sanitizing of their inputs, also
depending on users not to set/clear unused bits (ie: ensure 0 <= b <
nbits)."

I think that it wouldn't be terribly ugly to split out the 1 unsigned
long special cases (bitmap_and, bitmap_or, etc) with #ifdefs.  I think
that in some ways it makes it a little more readable because it gets rid
of "if (sizeof(foo) == sizeof(unsigned long))..." all over the place.  I
don't feel strongly enough about it to make a stink, though...

test_and_set_bit((bit), (mask)._m) ?
