Looking at drivers/base/core.c:dev_uevent() I wonder whenever
a device can have both bus-specific uevent function AND
class-specific one.  If yes, the code in that routine is umm..
wrong.  Because in this case, bus-specific attributes will
be owerwritten by class-specific ones.
I mean this code (debugging omitted for simplicity):
    if (dev->bus && dev->bus->uevent) {
            /* have the bus specific function add its stuff */
            retval = dev->bus->uevent(dev, envp, num_envp, buffer, buffer_size);
    }
    if (dev->class && dev->class->dev_uevent) {
            /* have the class specific function add its stuff */
            retval = dev->class->dev_uevent(dev, envp, num_envp, buffer, buffer_size);
    }
    return retval;
Thanks.
