very good so far...

OK, then no problem there.

good...

_GREAT_ ... now, the reason I asked if you notice any new slowdowns is
exactly what you seem to realize: I feared the ctx_sw patch may cause
obvious slowdown.  This could be because the ctw_on/offs are in the
wrong place, and causing much to much locking.
It seems like you notice no problems, and I am happy.
I am glad to hear this news, I am going to take a look at highmem's code
and then integrate a final solution into the preemption patch.

Sure, you can run dbench <
ftp://samba.org/pub/tridge/dbench/>
 try it
with around 16 threads (dbench -16).  You might also want to try playing
an mp3 in the background during this.  Notice it should not have large
skips (one user reporting 3s skipps dropping to 0.5s and 0s).
You can run the audio latency test
<
http://www.gardena.net/benno/linux/latencytest-0.42.tar.gz>,
 although I
heard there are problems compiling it from some other preemption users.
Finally, simply time a kernel compile `time make dep clean bzImage' ...
We can use these for preemption enabled and disabled, highmem enabled
and disabled, etc...
Thank you for your help,
