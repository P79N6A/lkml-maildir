Yes, I agree with you.
spi_board_info ---> board writers.
spi_device ---> spi device driver writers.
It is very clear for me, a spi_master driver developer.
But how does a board writer know the capabilities which the target
spi_device driver supports? For example, a board writer use 16
bits_per_word in a spi_board_info, while the spi_device does not support
this. And maybe other special function spi_device driver can provide but
board writer doesn't know or doesn't know how to use this in
spi_board_info.
So can we just use one struct for both board writers and spi device
driver developers?
Thanks
