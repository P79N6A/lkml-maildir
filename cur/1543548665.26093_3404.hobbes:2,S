I'm less than sure that keeping architecture-specific development out of
the main tree is a good thing. Usual scenario (seen that quite a few
times): tree for architecture foo is based on mainstream version x.y.z,
in x.y.z+5 change happens in the mainstream tree and in-tree variant of
arch/foo/* is updated. In x.y.z+10 foo-specific stuff gets synced with the
main tree and we are getting a huge mess, since repository for foo didn't
get the updates back in x.y.z+5.
Having all stuff in one place may help, but...
