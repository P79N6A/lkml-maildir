Because what I need is an absolute minimum. Heck, I don't even use
regular files (in the full variant of patch, that is). They might
become useful, but I can live with mkdir() and mknod(). Moreover,
I want it mounted very early. Right now I'm doing that after initcalls,
but there's a very good reason to move the thing as early as possible.
So the fewer things it uses - the better.
