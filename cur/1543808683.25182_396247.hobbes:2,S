/me reads spec. *sigh*  Whatever idiocy-committee wrote that spec was  
clearly either smoking crack or living in a fantasy-world (or both).   
An arbitrary unrestricted DMA bus is a massive and painfully obvious  
security hole.  Can somebody _please_ shoot the guy that came up with  
that brilliant idea?  At least it looks like it's not available if  
the firewire modules aren't loaded, which means that you can prevent  
that sort of attack, and my laptop luckily doesn't load those modules  
at boot just to save a bit of memory.  Even still, that's just a  
terrible idea.  Is there any practical way to restrict DMA and make  
FireWire secure?
Cheers,
