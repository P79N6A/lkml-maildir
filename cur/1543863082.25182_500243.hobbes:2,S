So what's the right way to limit pagecache?

It doesn't reduce the amount of memory available to the system. It
just reduce the amount of memory available to the page cache. So that
page cache is limited and the reserved memory can be allocated by the
application.

I think we have explained the reason too much. We are working on
no-mmu arch and provide a platform running linux to our customer. They
are doing very good things like mplayer, asterisk, ip camera, etc on
our platform, some applications was migrated from mmu arch. I think
that means in some cases no-mmu arch is somewhat better than mmu arch.
So we are taking effort to make the migration smooth or make no-mmu
linux stronger.
It's no way to let our customer modify their applications, we also
unwilling to do it. And we have not an existing mechanism to set up a
pools for the complex applications. So I'm trying to do some coding
hack in the kernel to satisfy these kinds of requirement.
And as you see, the patch seems to solve the problems on my side. But
I'm not sure it's the right way to limit vfs cache, So I'm asking for
comments and suggestions and help, I'm not asking to clobber the
kernel.
