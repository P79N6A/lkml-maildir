Hi,
I have a SGI O2 knocking about which currenty runs irix, fair enougth.
One quick question, if i wanted to get linux working on it, how would
i go about this, as i know that there are  currently issues with the
o2 due to its caching and its framebuffer.
Im guessing that i'd have to patch it, but i admit that im not good
enogth to write a patch for it yet.

Thanks,
