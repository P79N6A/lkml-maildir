On Barcelona systems?

I don't know why. I'm just not aware of any serious problems that
are solved by extended config space access.
Originally we had trouble because MCFG was wrong and the systems
would not boot. Also there is one class of systems (some x86 Apples) 
where cf8 doesn't work, but MMCONFIG does.
But that's all specific to older systems.

It will be supported when the BIOS gets it right.

My suggestion is to rely on MMCONFIG for this.
