Right, and if you do reclaim against containers which are over their
limits, the containers being unfairly charged will tend to get hit
first.  But, once this happens, I would hope that the ownership of those
shared pages should settle out among all of the users.
If you have 100 containers sharing 100 pages, container0 might be
charged for all 100 pages at first, but I'd hope that eventually
containers 0->99 would each get charged for a single page.
