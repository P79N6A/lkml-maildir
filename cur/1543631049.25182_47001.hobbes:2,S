    Considering how few registers ix86 architecture has, and
    them being 32 bit wide ones, regular (once a second ?)
    task scanning and detecting such overflows would be most
    usefull approach.  Less code, and register pressure in
    the fast path.

    I don't think so.   E.g. even with 1 GB/sec bandwidth (hmm..
    perhaps that is achievable in next few years..) and 32 bit
    counters it is just a matter of how frequently you scan these
    variables.  To know how much data has been moved since the
    last measurement, you need to keep the value of the previous
    scan time around.  E.g.:
        int intervalread = NN->bytes_read - NN->previous_bytes_read;
        NN->previous_bytes_read = NN->bytes_read;
    Add there code to detect when "bytes_read" has overflowed, and
    external monitoring code can then combine those components into
    64 bit quantity..  (The /proc/ printout code can do it)

   Number of syscalls,  The more your process makes syscalls, the more
   it makes context switches, but still does not consume its time quanta.
   (Consider: 100 clocks for syscall, 2.5 GHz CPU -> 25 M syscalls/sec ?)
   Use of these counters should be defined.  Mere "it would be nice to
   collect data" is not very good motivation for Linus to include the 
   code.  (Of course I would like to see all BSD facility accounting
   things when a process exits -- knowing number of X/Y/Z might sometimes
   tell me something usefull..)
   Defining some believable theory/algorithm to use these variales
   in e.g. scheduling goodness calculation..  perhaps in a form of
   "scan all processes 10 times a second for IO/syscall activity
    tuner for scheduler"
   Will the analysis truly need real-time calculation in the scheduler's
   fast-path, or can it be based on one computed scalar value which is
   updated one to ten times a second ?
