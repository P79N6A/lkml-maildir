http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-tip.git;a=heads
Is the correct topic branch for ftrace auto-ftrace-next?
maybe:
T:	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-tip.git auto-ftrace-next
No idea what's right here.  I had some private emails

to use tip.
Steven?  Suggestions?
