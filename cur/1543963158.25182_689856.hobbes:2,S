<comes back from fixing more rejects>
When adding
- new Makefile entries
- new Kconfig entries
- new #includes
- new Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt records
- etc
you usually don't *have* to place your new entry right at the end of the
list.  Doing this maximises the probability of causing collisions with
other people's work.
So, to make life simpler for those who integrate your work, please consider
putting these entries somewhere other than where-everyone-else-puts-theirs.
You may even find that right-at-the-end wasn't the most appropriate place
anyway.  But random insertion works well too.
Thanks.
