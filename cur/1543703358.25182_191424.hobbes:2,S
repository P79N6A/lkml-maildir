Yes i believe the 8 node NUMA-Qs do this easily.

For some odd reason i thought we had dynamic allocated MP busses.

What i'm trying to say is that the current code will behave badly when you
actually do encounter a system with that many RTEs, the actual array
being that large isn't a problem, the problem is what's going on in
assign_irq_vector() and later on with set_intr_gate(). By that i mean;
- The interrupt[] stub in entry.S is written with 256 irqs in mind so it
wouldn't be able to pass higher irq numbers to do_IRQ in it's current
state.
- "Wrapping" in assign_irq_vector means that you overrite previously
assigned vector entries in the IDT with whatever interrupt[irq] you happen
to be installing at the time. To avoid this you should not be allowing
more than ~224 vectors to be handed out by assign_irq_vector(), with the
patch and the current code, this is possible.
Lastly i think we should avoid sharing vectors, going the IA64 route and
setting up irq handling domains of sorts would allow for easier scaling
both up and down.
Thanks,
