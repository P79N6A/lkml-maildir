Hi, All.
    I found scheduler_tick() use current macro to get task_struct of 
current task.
    I seen scheduler_tick() is called every timer interrupt at most 
time. In this
case, I think scheduler_tick() is in interrupt context (enter kernel by 
interrupt),
So I have a hunch that there have not thread_info which it need in 
kernel stack. But
It seem it can work perfectly.
    I can not understand this. Would any expert like explain clearly for 
it ?
    Thanks in advanced.
