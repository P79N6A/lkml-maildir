Hi, It's always me :)
This time I had a problem that scared me a bit...
Yesterday I've tested fcache for a while.
I have primed system boot + preferred applications startup, and then
I've used the system for a while.
Today I launch my mail-client (Sylpheed-Claws) and the Setup Wizard
dialog appears :-O!  (usually it appears when it isn't configured)
After a bit of reserch I've found that an XML config file
(.sylpheed-claws/folderlist.xml) was corrupted.
But it wasn't corrupted randomly, it was "replaced" with a peace of the
firefox cookies file :-X!
Now, Firefox and Sylpheed-Claws are 2 of the few application I've
primed... so my suspect is that there's some subtle BUG in fcache, or
maybe it's elsewhere since it is an experimental kernel after all...
Luckily	Sylpheed-Claws makes backup copy of every config file :)
The size of the corrupted file is almost identical to the backup one
(so it is probably equal to the size of the original one).
Even if there is really a BUG in fcache so that it can supply wrong
data I don't know how it got written to the real filesystem (since the
corruption persisted booting without fcache). Maybe Sylpheed-Claws have
read the file and then rewritten to it... I don't know.
Every time something like this happens I ask myself why I test
experimental things on my main PC...
I think this time I was lucky :)
