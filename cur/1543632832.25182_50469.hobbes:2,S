L1/L2 cache is on CPU. L3 is on motherboard. The kernel only reports
(and cares about) L1/L2 (And then asides from informational purposes,
i.e. /proc/cpuinfo, it's only used for anything useful under SMP which isn't
an issue for K6-3)
The L3 is being used transparently, with no need for any support by
the kernel. (As long as it's been enabled by the BIOS)
