hm, is this SMP? Alpha uses asm-generic/percpu.h. One "early bootup" 
effect on Alpha that i can think of could have been this family of 
commits:
 commit acdac87202a408133ee8f7985076de9d2e0dc5ab

     percpu: make the asm-generic/percpu.h more "generic"
you wont be able to revert this patch cleanly, perhaps try to compile 
commit cf8fa920cb4271f17e0265c863d64bea1b31941a and see whether it 
boots. (that tree does not have the percpu changes yet)
if that doesnt help then i guess it's the bisection of 9000+ commits :-/
