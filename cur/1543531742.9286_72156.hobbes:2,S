another problem is that it seems it lost it serial console.
I expected loss of virtual consoles, but not the serial console.
Is there anything what I can do to still use serial console? 
init just complains that it can't start it .

if I try to start getty manually it just does not work ( can type at login
prompt user id, but if i type passwd it is not invisible anymore and it
won't let me login
is there equivalent of 'open' command for serial console?
