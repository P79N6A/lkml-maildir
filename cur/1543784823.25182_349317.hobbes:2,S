In downloading the whole source tree for the 2.6 kernel, I note that 
there is quite a bit of code relating to architectures other than the 
one I'm using.  While this is a "good thing", it does take up space and if
I search for something in the kernel (grep, or some such), the non-used
architectures can take up additional time.
A proposal:
Have a top level make target that prunes (deletes summarily) the 
unwanted architectures from the source tree.  This should be able to be 
done before, or after a config step, but might not be allowed after the 
first make.  Of course, this step is optional, but for those of us who 
only have a single machine type, it would save a bunch of time.
Thanks
