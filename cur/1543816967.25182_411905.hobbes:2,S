It still does "QoS".  The TBF has a "fill rate", which is basically N
tokens per M jiffies.  Then you just set the size of the "bucket", and
the prio bonus given is between -5 (when bucket is full) and +15 (when
bucket is empty).  The normal -10 to +10 'interactive' prio bonus is
reduced to -5 to +5 to compensate.
In other words, it's like a global 'nice' across all of the processes in
the vserver.
So, these characteristics do provide some level of guarantees, but not
all that people expect.  eg, people want to say "cap usage at 5%", but
as designed the scheduler does not ever prevent runnable processes from
running if the CPUs have nothing better to do, so they think the
scheduler is broken.  It is also possible with a fork bomb (assuming the
absence of appropriate ulimits) that you start enough processes that you
don't care that they are all effectively nice +19.
Herbert later made it add some of these guarantees, but I believe there
is a performance impact of some kind.

Well, it does not aim to be 'fair', it aims to be useful for allocating
CPU to vservers.   ie, if you allocate X% of the CPU in the system to a
vserver, and it uses more, then try to make it use less via priority
penalties - and give others shortchanged or not using the CPU very much
performance bonuses.  That's all.
So, if you under- or over-book CPU allocation, it doesn't work.  The
idea was that monitoring it could be shipped out to userland.  I just
wanted something flexible enough to allow virtually any policy to be put
into place without wasting too many cycles.

Right.  I considered that approach but just couldn't be bothered
implementing it, so went with the TBF because it worked and was
lightweight.

Right.

Sometimes the answer has to be "mu".
