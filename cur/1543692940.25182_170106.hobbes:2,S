No .. that's exactly the point. Check the other dmesg out, which is the
same machine, same partitions, same kernel-config (nearly) just another
kernel. It's not the root= boot option that is wrong. that is correct.
It points to /dev/sda2 and that is exactly the same partition i boot to
every time.

Q: What's the difference between the 1950's and the 1980's?
A: In the 80's, a man walks into a drugstore and states loudly, "I'd
like some condoms," and then, leaning over the counter, whispers,
"and some cigarettes."
