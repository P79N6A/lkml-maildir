Hi Rusty,
Please consider the following non-module code snippet:
int
sys_enable_foo_security()
{
        foocache = kmalloc(100000);
        register_security(&foo_ops);
}
int
sys_disable_foo_security()
{
        unregister_security(&foo_ops);
        kfree(foocache);  // OOPS
}
If I follow Roman's argument correctly, the unload race is not module
specific.  (The problem is that unregister_security() only asserts that no
new callers will be made to foo_ops, it doesn't guarantee that there are no
current callers.)
In the above example, one solution would be to reference count foocache.
However, another viable solution would be to ref-count the security_ops
field.
Anyway, given that the problem is a general resource management issue (and
not module specific), I think one could implement call_security() with less
overhead:
#define call_security(method , ...)					\
	({ int __ret;							\
	   read_lock(&SecurityLock);                                    \
	   __ret = security_ops->method(__VA_ARGS__);                   \
           read_unlock(&SecurityLock);                                  \
	  __ret;							\
	})
where (un)register_security used a write_lock to guard accesses to
security_ops changes.
This implementation is still a bit sluggish (as well as limiting), however
one could conceivable use RCU or a similar mechanism to further reduce
overhead of the common path.

P.S. it may also be possible for this alternate solution to work:
#define call_security(method , ...)					\
	({ int __ret;							\
           atomic_inc(&SecurityRefCount);                               \
	   __ret = security_ops->method(__VA_ARGS__);                   \
           atomic_dec(&SecurityRefCount);                               \
	})
where unregister_security set the security_ops field to a dummy value and
then waited for the ref-count to hit zero before returning.  However, this
may depend too heavily on memory ordering..
