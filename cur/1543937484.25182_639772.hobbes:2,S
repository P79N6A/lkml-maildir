Yes, very much so. I'm working on getting the latency_tracer from the -rt
patch into something suitable for mainline. We need to calculate the max
latencies on the fly. If we hit a max, then we save it off, otherwise, we
blow away the trace and start again.

The cost is only done when the marker is armed. Since the marker is an
unlikely, and will be placed at the end of the function.

This was exactly my point to Mathieu, but I think he has LTTng very much
coupled with the markers. I haven't played with LTTng (yet), but from what
I've read (Mathieu, correct me if I'm wrong), it seems that all the
markers become visible to userspace, and the user can simple turn them on
or off. LTTng doesn't need any knowledge of the marker since the marker
contains how to print the information.
So* by placing a "prev %p next %p" as the only information, we lose out on
this automated way LTTng works. Because the two pointers are just
meaningless numbers to the user.

Well, actually when I first wrote this letter, I used "--" as a delimiter
to allow a tool to hide the pretty stuff. But then I thought about the
"clever hack" with the '\0',  The "--" may be better since it wont break
systemtap.
