System description:
   - AOpen i915GMm-HFS, Pentium M 750
   - The software once was a SuSE 9.2, Xorg is updated to 6.9
   - intelfb
Occasionally the system locks up while switching from X
to the framebuffer console. The keyboard is completely
dead, monitor turns black. Shutdown by pressing the
power button works, but the logs contain no indication
of a problem.
Any ideas?
cu,
 Knut
