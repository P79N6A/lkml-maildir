I've done similar things myself.  My drivers, including network and
char devices, work on all kernels from 2.0 to 2.4 using similar
kcompat-like macros.  I've not extended any to work with 2.5, though.
If you want to write drivers that work on 2.4 and 2.2 kernels, that's
easy: #include <kcompat.h> or whatever you use, and call
SET_MODULE_OWNER in your drivers.
However, if you insist on using drivers from the 2.4 kernel tree on
2.2 kernels, that's a different matter, and you have a point.
For 3rd party drivers that I've written, I take the first approach and
write code that very nearly conforms to 2.4 style except when it is
not possible for that to be back compatible.  This occurs in certain
file operations (2.0 has different function prototypes), in mapping
device memory to user space (change from vma->vm_offset to ->vm_pgoff,
PCI configuration (lots of changes in 2.1.93 :) and a few other
things.
It is all very well to insist that SET_MODULE_OWNER() remains so you
can take 2.4 drivers and easily compile them for 2.2...  but why is
that the benchmark?  I can't take 2.4 drivers and do that, because I
want to support 2.0 as well, so I bite the bullet and make the
necessary changes for broader compatibility.
So.. back to a point.  Is 2.2 compilability (with the help of kcompat)
one of the goals to aim for in 2.5 drivers generally?  Or is this
specifically meant for the network drivers which you support?
