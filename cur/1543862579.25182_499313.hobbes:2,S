xenbus_printf isn't a printf replacement - it is used for writing a formatted 
string into XenStore (which contains  VM configuration data in a 
human-readable form).
Internally it does a vsnprintf into a buffer and writes the resulting string 
to the XenStore.

I'm not familiar with this code...  but perhaps the (fake) multisession 
handling is to keep userspace that queries this happy?  I can't really think 
of anywhere this would apply off the top of my head, though.
