Linus, please pull the latest scheduler fixes git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched-devel.git for-linus
[ Note: it touches net/core/sock.c to tweak two socket wakeups there. ]
this tree improves/fixes lat_ctx/lat_pipe/bw_pipe latency/performance on 
SMP systems:
                      .25-rc6            .25-rc6-sched/for-linus
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   lat_ctx 2 :        1.93 us                0.69 us
   lat_pipe  :        4.96 us                2.49 us
   bw_pipe   :     2841.11 MB/sec         3436.61 MB/sec
it also improves the ramp-up phase of sysbench on a quad:
                      .25-rc6            .25-rc6-sched/for-linus
   -------------------------------------------------------------
      1:     ( 836.64 per sec.)         (1216.90 per sec.)
      2:     (2407.02 per sec.)         (2361.12 per sec.)
      4:     (4468.59 per sec.)         (4510.14 per sec.)
( similar improvements were measured on an 8-way and on various
  dual boxes as well - a 16way box was largely unchanged. )
these changes also improved some other workloads as well: mysql, apache 
and others - and it did not impact some others that we handled well 
before (such as kbuild, hackbench and others).
Thanks,
	Ingo
