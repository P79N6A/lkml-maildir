I'm looking at the IBM header files on our AIX box.  Incidentally,
whoever "corrected" the spelling of EBCDIC should note that the same
exact typo is in the AIX /usr/include/sys/bootrecord.h I'm looking at. :)
As far as I can tell, the boot ROM snarfs up the first 512 byte block, and then
looks for the 'IBMA' magic cookie, then looks at offset 0x1BE for a
bog-standard 4-entry partition table, and a 0x55AA at offset 0x1FE.
Additionally, there will be an *ASCII* '_LVM' in the first 4 bytes of physical
512-byte block 7, denoting the start of the LVM control record.
I'd say if you find both the IBMA *and* _LVM cookies intact, you declare it
an AIX volume.
