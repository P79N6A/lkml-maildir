Hi folks.
1) Are there any new developments in this issue? Does someone know if
AMD and Nvidia is still investigating?
2) Steve Langasek from Debian sent me a patch that disables the hw-iommu
per default on Nvidia boards.
I've attached it in the kernel bugzilla and asked for inclusion in the
kernel (until we find a real solution).
I'd be pleased if all of you (who experienced the data corruption) could
test this patch.
Note: This patch is NOT a real solution for the issue, it just applies
our workaround (iommu=soft) per default
