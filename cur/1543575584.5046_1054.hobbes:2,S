Yo All!
Scott McDermott <vaxerdec@frontiernet.net> convinced me the way
to fix my problem with SMBFS was to use the INIT_LIST_HEAD() macro.
This allows SMBFS to compile and may even be correct:
--- sock.c.dist	Mon Dec 11 15:26:56 2000
+++ sock.c	Mon Dec 11 15:27:03 2000

-	job->cb.next = NULL; // gem
+	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&job->cb.list);
 	job->cb.sync = 0;
 	job->cb.routine = smb_data_callback;
 	job->cb.data = job;
I am confused because INIT_LIST_HEAD() sets the next and prev
pointers to point to the current structure.  I just have to
assume the list folks know what they are doing and that is why they
made it a macro.
Could someone that knows lists and/or smbfs look at this?
