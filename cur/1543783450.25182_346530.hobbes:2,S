Hi, everyone.
    I know kernel oops can be seen by run 'dmesg', but if
kernel crashed, we can not run it.   so I reconfigure syslogd
to support remote forward, the debug machine content of
syslogd.conf is:
##################
    kern.*             @192.168.28.137
    (more lines after it are ignored)
##################
    and run syslogd with '-m 0 -h' option.
    the macheine have IP 192.168.28.137, its syslogd.conf:
##################
    #kern.*            /var/messages
    (more lines after it are ignored)  
##################
    and I run syslogd on this machine with '-r' option.
    After all, I run "tail -f /var/messages" on 192.168.28.137,
I can see boot log and normal printk() result. Well! however,
the most importantest message, crash Oops is lost.
    Any suggest on it?
    Wait for any reply. thanks in advanced.
