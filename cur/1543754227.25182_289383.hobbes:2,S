I do not agree with you, Adrian, but I will not contend.
As I say, noone protects against the same program names and there are
mechnisms to differ modules by simply looking in lsmod output.
Noone can damage systrem by loading "wrong" module.
So I still do not see problems here.
As I say I will change superio scx200 name since it is easier than
flood about unmatched points of view.
I will send patch through Greg and Andrew later.
Thank you, Adrian, for your comments.
