This works for the special case of sleep(), which is the example I took,
just because the libc5 sleep implementation looks for the return value;
but what about the other blocking system calls (like nanosleep) ? do they
check properly on EINTR errno that the SIGCONT received signal did have a
signal handling function at the time they received the signal, and restart
automagically the  system call that should not have been interrupted ?
This is the reason why my guess is that this feature should be fixed
in the kernel (if Linux is to be POSIX-compliant).
