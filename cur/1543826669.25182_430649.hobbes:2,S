I vote for genirq inclusion in 2.6.18 too. I'm almost finishing porting
powerpc over to it and so far it looks good. In addition, I'm pretty
confident the patches have a very low impact (if at all) on archs that
haven't been ported over (the old mecanism is still there mostly
untouched). 
In addition, I'm doing some fairly heavy rework of some of the powerpc
irq management that is based on top of the genirq port and I'd really
want it in 2.6.18...
Finally, we are doing some crash-work on MSI (trying to get some basic
support for powerpc separate from the current unuseable
drivers/pci/msi.c) so we can at least get something working in 2.6.18
and that too will be based on my work mentioned above.
So as far as I'm concerned, genirq is pretty important to have in right
at the beginning.
Cheers,
Ben.
