    You want to say that space is always allocated?
    And how can you make graceful error handling if there is no memory left?
    malloc() has return value, mlock() has return value. So there is at 
least room for error handling. But in your case if you will by mistake 
will run second instance of application - what will happend? I suppose 
crash or welcome oom_killer. Both not nice.

   I was thinking about this - it has a lot of adavantages and one very 
big disadvantage: you need to recompile app to scale system, you cannot 
make this a command line/configuration parameter.

   A-ha. A la mtd/rw flash.
   Intersting idea.
   Let's say: I'm working on embedded system - but it is less embedded 
than other embedded systems ;-)
   Thanks for your advices in any way - probably something can be used 
in future.

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
