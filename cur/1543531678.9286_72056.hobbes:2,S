In other words, all the arguments presented so far by both sides
of this argument have been way off field? Somehow, that doesnae
surprise me.

The commonest anti-overcommit argument I've seen is that the
program that called malloc() too much shouldn't get killed
either, and that doesn't make sense to me.

That summarises my take on the underlying situation as well.

I'm not fond of them either, but one needs to have them unless
one can safely assume that there are no idiots around who will
try to break into one's system...

I believe Alan also pointed out that if application programs have
used all memory in a non-overcommit scenario and something causes
the kernel to want to either page in a swapped out buffer or load
some module so that it can report this fact, there are serious
problems.

Personally, I've had no problems that I could place as being due
to overcommitted memory, so I intend to follow the advice not to
fix something that isn't broken.
Best wishes from Riley.
