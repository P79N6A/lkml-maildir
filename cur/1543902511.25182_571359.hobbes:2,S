Spectacularly no! With this patch the "glitch1" script with multiple 
scrolling windows has all xterms and glxgears stop totally dead for 
~200ms once per second. I didn't properly test anything else after that. 
Since the automount issue doesn't seem to start until something kicks it 
off, I didn't see it but that doesn't mean it's fixed.

Hope that info helps.
