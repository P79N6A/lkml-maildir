hm.  Linus's new suspend/resume thing seems to have a two-phase suspend,
but not, afaict, a two-phase resume.  If it did, and if the second resume
phase were to run with IRQs enabled then we should be able to address this
appropriately.

Well if hacks are OK it'd actually be reliable to do
	/* comment goes here */
	kmalloc(size, irqs_disabled() ? GFP_ATOMIC : GFP_KERNEL);
because the irqs_disabled() thing happens for well-defined reasons. 
Certainly that's better than looking at system_state (and I don't think we
leave SYSTEM_RUNNING during suspend/resume anyway).
