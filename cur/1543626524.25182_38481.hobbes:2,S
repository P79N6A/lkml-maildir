Considering the fact we are much more likely to hear complaints when
things are broken and people are seeking a fix than praise otherwise,
I think this is a little unfair.  For the vast numbers of nvidia users
I don't think there are that many problems reported and I'm not
convinced the CURRENT nvidia drivers are necessarily doing anything
bad[1].

    suffer filesystem corruption, crashes or memory leaks.
