with "intrusive" i meant, that all modules are now compressed by default and 
there is no switch to build them uncompressed.
so you change a long established default which may not be welcomed by 
everyone and give no option for conservative people.
we should take care and not break things.
default uncompressed, compressed implented as an option is a better 
strategy, imho.
discuss changing the default at a later time then.
