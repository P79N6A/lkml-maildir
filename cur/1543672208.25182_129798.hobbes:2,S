my fstab-entry:
192.168.0.50:/mnt/nfs_1 /mnt/nfs_1      nfs             rw,hard,intr,user,nodev,nosuid,exec         0 0
from man mount:
[snip] The process cannot be interrupted or killed unless you also specify intr. [/snip]
I can't interrupt any process that accessed the NFS-server
while shutting down the server, although intr is specified.
_That's_ my problem. :)
