Define netdead exactly. The machine is very unresponsive to any local input,
correct ?

Not quite. The reason is that it processes so many interrupts that it cannot
do any other work.  The NIC interrupts feeds packet much faster than the
network bottom half can process them. The NIC interrupt and the NETBH
are running near continuously, not leaving any CPU time for anything else.
It is a well known weakness. Get two machines connected via fast ethernet. 
Send a stream of 64byte UDP packets from one to the other without any rate
limit. The other is nearly dead (and it doesn't send any RSTs at all). It 
helps a bit to have a NIC that does proper interrupt mitigation in this 
case and does flow control with your NIC [e.g. there are some hacked tulip 
drivers that handle it better, most gigabit ethernet chips also handle it 
better because it is a bigger problem on gigabit ethernet]
I think your analysis of that the replied RSTs are the main problem is not
quite correct.

They did it because that hit a well known bug in BSD stacks (making the
stack do much more work than for a simple RST). On Linux it doesn't matter
much.
I don't know why you're blocking non ACK packets, it does not make much sense.

It seems your firewall can take packet floods better than your IRC server.
Not suprising.

It'll probably help against clueless script kiddies that only run a single
attack script, but be warned that there are other ways to make TCP bounce 
packets as well (given an established connection)
