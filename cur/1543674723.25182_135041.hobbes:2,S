Just for clarification.  Marcelo never asked me for a fix.  The only
mail I received from him was an informational message indicating that
the code was being backed out.  If I had been provided an opportunity
to fix the problem, I would have. Considering that the fix has been
available long before RC2 was cut (May 1st.), it's not hard to see that
getting a proper fix required nothing more than just upgrading the driver
or contacting its maintainer to get a paired down fix.
