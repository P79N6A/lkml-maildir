Did you overwrite /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.x or did you copy bzImage to /boot
and add it to lilo as
"another" OS? If so, you should be able to boot off the orgional kernel.
If not, the only thing I know to do is reinstall RH 7.1 and choose the
upgrade option.
Below is a sample of my /etc/lilo.conf which boots the orgional RH 6.2
kernal as default,
boots 2.2.19 as new, boots 2.4.2 as 2.4.2, and boots windows as dos.
boot=/dev/hda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
linear
default=linux
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14-5.0
        label=linux
        initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.14-5.0.img
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda2
image=/boot/bzImage
        label=new
        initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.19.0.img
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda2
image=/boot/bzImage-2.4
        label=2.4
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda2
other=/dev/hda1
        label=dos
