Subject: Hang when using a Matrox G550 with DVI

When I have a DVI display plugged into my Matrox G550 video card the
Linux kernel 2.6.11 hangs while booting. This can be worked around by
"disabling CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT and/or comment out call to store_edid
in arch/i386/boot/video.S" [1], or by unplugging the DVI display
before the kernel boots and plugging it back in before X starts. This
is the same bug listed here [2], and it has been around since the
2.5.67-bk6 days.
Please cc me in your reply. Cheers,
Shaun
