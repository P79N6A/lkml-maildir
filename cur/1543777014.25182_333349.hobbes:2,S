You have irq balancing, the line 
CONFIG_IRQBALANCE=y
in your config file confirms it - I am not completely sure that it is
the root of the problem but when I experienced the problem I changed
two things: my acpi code and irq balancing and one of then made the
difference, I am just to lazy to check which one it is (also it is
production servers so I cannot do whatever I want).

I use the same io scheduler so that should not be a problem. I have
uploaded my config file - it works on ibm 335/336 servers, and a quick
look at your boot msg seams to indicate that your server have some of
the same hardware - note however that I load ide/scsi/filesystem stuff
as modules so you will need to build a initrd to use my config.
the config is here
