Subject: Any cure for kupdate freezing ongoing  I/Os ?

I am running the 2.2.14 linux kernel, and doing
buffered writes to disk. Whenever kupdate runs, I
notice that the I/Os freeze up, sometimes taking 10-20
seconds to complete. Are there any patches to the
kernel to prevent thsi kind of behaviour ? I am using
the standard bdflush parameters. Is this problem
ameliorated in the 2.4 kernel ? 
 Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. Since
I am not a member of this list, could you please reply
to trvish@yahoo.com ?
Thanks
T R Vishwanath.
