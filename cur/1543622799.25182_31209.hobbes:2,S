There were no problems with 2.4.19-pre1, to which I reverted, pulled
the full 2.4.18, and patched back up to 2.4.19-pre1-ac2.
Booted into 2.4.19-pre1-ac2.
Patched back down to 2.4.18 and then back up to 2.4.19-pre1-ac2 again,
no problems seen.
Rebuilt 2.4.19-pre1-ac2 in 2.4.19-pre1-ac2. Reboot.
Ran the following twice.
for i in $(seq 1 10)
do 
 bzcat /net/tw/home/jrh/dl/patch-2.4.19-pre1-ac2.bz2 | patch -p1 -R
 bzcat /net/tw/home/jrh/dl/patch-2.4.19-pre1.bz2 | patch -p1 -R
 sleep 1
 bzcat /net/tw/home/jrh/dl/patch-2.4.19-pre1.bz2 | patch -p1  
 bzcat /net/tw/home/jrh/dl/patch-2.4.19-pre1-ac2.bz2 | patch -p1 
 echo "===========>" Step $i 
done
No problems seen. ac1 would have not have survived the above, so I'm
pretty sure that 2.4.19-pre1-ac2 has fixed the pre1 problems.
