Who cares? exec is fast.

This is distribution problem, not kernel problem. "/bin/ls should be
built into kernel, because otherwise you can't call /bin/ls from
script" is not an argument.
If UTF-8 compatibility is important, distros will get it right. If it
is not, you loose, but at least kernel is not messed up.
