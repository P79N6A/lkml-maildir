If we were totally rigurous about representing each device as a device node, 
your solution would be fine.  But we don't.
The clocksource model (/sys/devices/system/clocksource) is a better way to 
go.  One sysfs file is used to enumerate the possible sources and another is 
used to read or set the current source.   No new system calls; no new ioctls.
