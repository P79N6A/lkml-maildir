ok, fixed a couple of bugs on x64, it boots on my box now. The main 
breakage was the elimination of the preemption-disabling soft irq flag 
in -53-05, that unearthed an irq-flags 32-bitness bug in the spinlock 
macros, which was there for ages. This resulted in the early reboot 
during bootup.
I've uploaded 2.6.13-rt12 with the fixes.
