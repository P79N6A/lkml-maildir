    You're probably using Ubuntu, am I right? I have a do-it-yourself
Linux box and my /bin/sh is dash. It is POSIX compliant, small and
lightning fast. I use as a reference shell. I have installed zsh and
bash, too, and sometimes I have to relink /bin/sh to point to /bin/bash
so certain scripts work...
