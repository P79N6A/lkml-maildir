Background - Smolt runs this during its install:
/bin/cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid > /etc/sysconfig/hw-uuid
For most users this would be run by the RPM %post scripts during install 
from anaconda. For some reason there are some UUID's (like those listed 
above) that come up more often then it seems they should if they are 
truly random.
