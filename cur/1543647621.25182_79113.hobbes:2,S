Both jfs and cifs ship a function called `dump_mem' causing the following
compile error when both are included:
<--  snip  -->
   ld -m elf_i386  -r -o fs/built-in.o ...
fs/jfs/built-in.o: In function `dump_mem':
fs/jfs/built-in.o(.text+0xe420): multiple definition of `dump_mem'
fs/cifs/built-in.o(.text+0x3af0): first defined here
make[1]: *** [fs/built-in.o] Error 1
make: *** [fs] Error 2
<--  snip  -->
