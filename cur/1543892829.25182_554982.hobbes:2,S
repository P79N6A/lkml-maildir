Um, how cheap do you need it?  get_random_int() is actually pretty
cheep, since it was designed to be usable by the networking stack for
sequence numbers for TCP packets; and it's not like sys_close() or
sys_open() is a majorly critical path, is it?  If the concern is
increasing the potential hold time, I suppose you could have the
exactly two callers of __put_unused_fd() (sys_close() and
put_unused_fd()) call get_random_int() before grabbing the
current->files->file_lock spinlock,
