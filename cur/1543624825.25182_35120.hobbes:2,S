Yes, but what's cool about it?  If not for the fact that there are weird
setups that actually use umsdos (i.e. compatibility reasons), the best
way to deal with it would be rm -rf...  If underlying filesystem has
normal semantics - you don't need anything, if it doesn't...  I'd suggest
to use combination of tar(1) and ramfs.  At least that way you get full
Unix semantics - no mess with rename breaking links, etc.

No.  That stuff is ugly as it is and trying to make it deal with unexpected
changes of underlying fs... <shudder>
