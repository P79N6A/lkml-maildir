Alex: Okay -- I've set up a script that ensures that
the "Archive" directory (was "Old") always includes links
to the latest versions of the pages, so you can be guaranteed
that links in Archive should always be stable (I don't know 
that I'll ever actually remove files from that directory).
Rob: the script also creates a LATEST-IS-m.xy file in 
/pub/linux/docs/manpages.
Cheers,
Michael
