     Is anyone else seeing this behavior? On Fedora Core 2 using the
their kernel-smp-2.6.6-1.403 and kernel-smp-2.6.6-1.406 kernels I 
am seeing a problem with a PS/2 Logitech keyboard becoming
non-functional after overnight. In particular the keyboard is
initially usable after the machine is woken the next morning
under X windows. Shortly afterwards (~15 minutes) the keyboard
stops responding. The PS/2 mouse still works however and one
can log out of the X windows session to restart the X server.
This however doesn't bring back the keyboard. Also unplugging
and replugging the keyboard doesn't help. Only a full reboot
will restore the keyboard to working condition. There is no
errors appearing in /var/log/messages that indicate any 
errors related to the keyboard. I have heard from at least
one other Fedora user who has seen the same thing under Core 2.
Is this perhaps related to acpi somehow and how can I work
around it since rebooting everyday is unacceptable.
