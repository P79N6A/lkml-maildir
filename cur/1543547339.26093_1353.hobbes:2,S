Okay, how do you implement it?
There's memory pressure, kernel needs ram. So it decides to write some
old data to disk. Data go to userland process on same machine; but we
already know we are short of memory. Userland process is likely to get
stopped due to low memory and you are deadlocked.
You could pagelock userland server to solve this.
