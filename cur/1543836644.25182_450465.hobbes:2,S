As I understand it..reading Documentation/ide.txt:
"hdx=noprobe" :  drive may be present, but do not probe for it
If the CMOS/BIOS is saying there is a drive there then the kernel may
be respecting that and looking for it there...I guess that would be
why Alan gave you the response he did.
There is an option:
"hdx=none"              : drive is NOT present, ignore cmos and do not probe
Did that work for you when you tried it? It looks like that option
will explicitly ignore the CMOS.
Apologies if I'm misinterpreting the docs/misunderstanding how the
kernel works, I'm inexperienced and worse the wear for beer.
Thanks,
adam
