hi, please reply cc to me as well because i am not on these lists
(well i am but the receive post options are switched off), thank you.
i have a "noddy" question where what used to work under 2.4.27
(echo 'hello world' > /dev/vc/0) now doesn't work on 2.6.7.11,
even though echo 'garbage' > /dev/fb/0 does - just like it
used to on 2.4.27.
this is with an arm embedded system i'm developing for (CLPS711x
derivative) and i have it set up so that the console is on the serial
port.
i have ported the framebuffer device over to 2.6, and have it working
(echo garbage > /dev/fb/0 shows up garbage in the top left corner).
what kernel options do i need such that echo 'hello world' >
/dev/vc/0 will work and i get my lovely flashing cursor back?
many thanks,
l.
