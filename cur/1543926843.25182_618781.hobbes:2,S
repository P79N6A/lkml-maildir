It's perfectly correct.  That it's an idiom you don't
seem to *like* but is distinct from correctness.

KERN_DEBUG is what says the message level is "debug".
Both styles log messages at that priority level.
Which is distinct from saying that the message should
vanish from non-debug builds ... that's what pr_debug
and friends do, by relying implicitly on "-DDEBUG".
In this case, the original code was saying that the
message should NOT just vanish.  One reason the patch
was incorrect was that even on its own terms, it was
wrong ... since it used the "-DDEBUG" mechanism wrong,
and prevented the message from *EVER* appearing.
