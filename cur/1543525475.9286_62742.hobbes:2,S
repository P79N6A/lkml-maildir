You're right.  It shouldn't, it's linked into the kernel.  I watched the
module compile which didn't show blkpg.c.  I watched the kernel compile and
I did see this file.  Maybe it's just the way it got built.  I had to do a
little work on the nic drivers so I could build the kernel.
For this above, I didn't sit there and watch the entire thing, I only built
that one subdir.
