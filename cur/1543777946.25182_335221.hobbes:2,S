This patch series spans both video4linux and linux-dvb trees. 
Remove the dvb_pll_desc from the lgdt3302 frontend and replace with a pll_set-callback to isolate the tuner programming from the frontend.
Select the RF input connector based upon the type of demodulation selected. ANT RF connector is selected for 8-VSB and CABLE RF connector is selected for QAM64/QAM256. Implement this along the lines posted to linux-dvb list (subscribers only) by Patrick Boettcher. ( 
http://linuxtv.org/pipermail/linux-dvb/2005-July/003557.html
 ) This only affects the cards that use the Microtune 4042 tuner. This is not ideal, but there is no current specification for selecting RF inputs. It makes the card work the same way as the Windows driver thus it may reduce user confusion.
