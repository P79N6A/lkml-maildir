"Acked-by:" does not mean "I like this" but rather "I approve of this". 
Someone who is not a maintainer is encouraged to speak of like and 
dislike, in great detail, but has no position at all to approve or 
disapprove of it going in.
If I put "Acked-by: John..." on a patch of any kind, even trivial, it 
would look incredibly stupid, because I'm just some guy messing around 
with the kernel. A tactful response to me doing that from any actual 
kernel bigwig would be, "I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you are not 
part of the kernel patch flow." Similarly, a tactful response to me 
NACKing a patch would be, "I appreciate your concern, but you are in no 
position to remove a patch from the stream. Your comments will be 
considered and implemented or countered by an actual maintainer."
This is appropriate.
