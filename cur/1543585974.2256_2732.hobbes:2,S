Thanks for reminding me - I'll look into it on the plane and see what I can
do with it.

Yes, configurability is probably a very good idea.  However, it would be
best to include a good set of general parameters in the kernel itself, so
the set of average systems needs as little tweaking as possible.  One
cannot expect every sysadmin to be familiar with these arcane (and rarely
actually used) parameters, so being able to select "server", "batch",
"workstation", "embedded" and so on would help massively.
