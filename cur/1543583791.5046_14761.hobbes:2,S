dou you actually want to page that high memory?  These high memory
configurations are usually used by databases and other huge applications
that have their own memory management.
Other UNIX versions, e.g. the UnixWare with dshm have implemented special
memory pools (in this case dshm) to give unswappable memory to this
applications.  While I don't like such implementations with fixed memory
pools it might be a good idea to have a MAP_DEDICATED flags to mmap
(/dev/zero) to allocate non-aged and thus non-paged memory.
To not make the system unusable by allocating too much of this memory
allocation might need a special capability and/or a dynamic limit of
allocatable unaged memory (sysctl?).
