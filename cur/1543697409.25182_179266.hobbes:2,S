Is the HDD led separate from the floppy LED?  On my thinkpad, they're
one of the same.
If yes, I'd guess that you've built a kernel without floppy support
built in.  The kernel used to turn the floppy motor off itself even
without floppy support, but this has been removed.  IIRC it is now
the responsibility of the boot loader to do this.
