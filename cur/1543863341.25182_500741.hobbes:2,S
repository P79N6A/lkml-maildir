That should be handled anyway. The current code actually spots this and

This I would hope you can hide in the platform specific
serial_in/serial_out functions. If you write the UART_LCR save it in
serial_out(), if you read IER etc.

Ditto... spot this case and whack it in your serial methods.
And we might want to add a void * for board specific insanity to the 8250
structures if we really have to so you can hang your brain damage
privately off that ?
