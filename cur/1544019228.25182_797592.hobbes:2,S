I don't know how to do it, but I can follow instructions well :)

It also seems to behave strangely in GPS mode.  Instead of sending
something of the form "1234567890...", it will send
1234567890...
234567890...
34567890...
and so on.  I'd like to look in to this more to see if I can write a workaround.
Cheers,
