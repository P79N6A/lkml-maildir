The problem is that HPET  consists of two parts:
	one is a main counter and second is a a timers.
	To enable main counter one must set HPET_CFG_ENABLE.
	It is set only on boot, and not on resume now.
	But on my system I think bios re-enables it.
	Secondary to enable HPET to act as a timer on IRQ0 and to make it replace RTC IRQ8 one must set
	HPET_CFG_LEGACY
	This bit is definitely not set on resume, so on my system I get a hang if I use HPET as clockevents device,
	and on other system where bios doesn't reenable HPET, then even if HPET is used as timing device 
	'date won't advance'
	But I set those bits only in initialization of HPET clockevents device, and I set always, when it is turned on,
	It is not that good,but works.
	Now I don't have a clue how to set those bits if only HPET is used as clock source because now clocksources
	don't have _any_ resume hook.
	The timing problem you mention I think isd connected to the fact that HPET is not enabled instantly after resume, but after some time when clockevents
	core calls HPET to enable event timer.
	Best regards,
