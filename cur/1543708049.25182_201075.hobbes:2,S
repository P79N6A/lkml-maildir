Eh?  We do know what the major shells do: They either look at the
first non-option argument for the script name, or they do not accept
options at all.
Anyway that's irrelevant: the splitting change only affects shell
_scripts_ which already have multiple options on the #! line, and
which depend on a space not splitting the argument.  If a script
doesn't have that, the shell's behaviour isn't affected by this
change.
Such scripts are non-portable because that behaviour isn't universal
(although I have a feeling the current Linux behaviour was done to
mimick some existing system - as it was never hard to implement
argument splitting of the original author had wanted to.)
In other words, what's relevant is which shell _scripts_ would be
affected, not which shells.
To find those scripts, do:
    find /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/X11R6/bin /usr/local/bin \
         /etc /usr/lib -type f \
    | xargs perl -ne 'print "$ARGV\n" if /^#! ?.+ .+ /; close ARGV'
(Or choose your own directories).
I didn't find any on my system.
