I'd think it would be nice if the help text had a note telling the user if 
it's safe to always enable this or not, even if it's not needed. Something 
along the lines of "It's safe to always enable this config option even if 
you don't need it." or "This option should only be enabled if needed as it 
may cause problems otherwise." - whatever applies...
