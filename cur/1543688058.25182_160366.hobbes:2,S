Same problem here. Without "pci=noacpi" the system doesn't detect any usb
decices, except hubs (internal ones)
Epox motherboard.
K7 650MHz
Till 2.6.0-test3-mm1 (or it was mm2?) it worked ok.
2.6.0-test4 has this problem.
The error is something about "nobody cared for interrupt #5".
I don't have more info now.
Thanks!
