I think the issue is that only one framebuffer is mapped to the console.
VESA sets the graphics state before any fbdev drivers are registered. I 
believe that vga16fb is registered to the console. Because vga16fb expects 
a different hardware state than what VESA has done you get the problems 
you experience.
