Subject: [PATCH] make vm_enough_memory more efficient

vm_enough_memory seems to call si_meminfo just to get the total 
RAM, which seems far too expensive. This replaces the comment
saying "this is crap" with some code that's less crap.
Not heavily tested (compiles and boots), but seems pretty obvious.
