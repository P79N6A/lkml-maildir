I wonder how this line gets into your patch. Please, remove it (patch follows).
My bootsector patch is NOT enclosed into 2.4.0-ac10.
Yes, I did rewrite some time ago the bootsect.S to enable booting a kernel
with (bootsect.o + setup.o) > 4 kB   
[ it happens eg. when video selection is compiled in ]
from a 360k/720k (8 sec/track) floppy, but AFAIR it is alredy obsolete and
has never been ported to 2.4.
Note that it is almost impossible to compile an usable [you must turn off
networking] i386 2.4 kernel which fits into 360k floppy...
And there are other bootsect.S related unsolved problems [large kernels].
Regards
   Andrzej
