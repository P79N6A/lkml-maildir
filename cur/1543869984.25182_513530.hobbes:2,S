In userspace you're better thinking of a STL list protected by some
POSIX threads primitives. Depending on what you really want to do
with the list, for example a shared work queue, you
could look into condition variables or rwlocks.
Use the standard STL list. You will save a lot of work. And they are not
so bad in performance.
