Well, it is not really a DoS. The rescheduling of the process is limited
by the scheduler and the available CPU time (depending on the number of
runnable tasks in the system).
>From the spec:
Implementations may place limitations on the granularity of timer
values. For each interval timer, if the requested timer value requires a
finer granularity than the implementation supports, the actual timer
value shall be rounded up to the next supported value.
The !HIGHRES enabled kernel rounds this up to the HZ interval, the
HIGHRES enabled kernel grants the request for this short sleep.
The program gets what it asked for: a stupid sleep value.
