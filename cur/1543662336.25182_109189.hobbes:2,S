You have to modify "cp" and "mv" (since a "mv" that crosses mount points
is equivalent to a "cp original destination/copy; rm original".
Now you also need to realize that you might NOT be able to copy all of the 
extended attributes (XFS supports system and user attributes, and only the
user attributes can be copied). This is the usual reason extended attributes
are not copied at all.
Another is what about applications that may copy files too: cat, tar, cpio, 
dd, vi, ed, ... and sh (remember the old "shcat" script:
	while[read v]; do; echo $v; done <original >copy)
And what do you do if the destination is not XFS?
And what about when the user is not the owner of the file, but does have read 
access?
