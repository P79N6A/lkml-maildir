However, the __get_free_pages (and friends) suggested below all refuse
to allocate more than 128KB on Intels (I'd read this before, and tested
it anyway to make sure).
Will the following work though?
If I call "__get_dma_pages" twice to get two 128KB chunks, and then
check to make sure that the two chunks are contiguous to each other, can
I then treat them as one 256KB chunk for my dma buffer?  Or will I run
into paging problems and/or read/write problems in the kernel memory if
I do this?
