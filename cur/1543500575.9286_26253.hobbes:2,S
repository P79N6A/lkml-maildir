Pretty good summary , but ... Issues like user specific overrides of
components are really an application issue. As I've said before, the
kernel provides the ability to do things - it's up to the application
to accomplish goals with this ability. In this override case, the
'bundle' is the base application and the application would need
to provide for user override of the base. As an example, KDE has
icons, themes, wallpaper, etc. for the installation (base bundle), but
a user may replace or supplement this with his/her own versions.
The bundle doesn't change, but there may be another bundle in the
user's home that the application uses to override.
Of course, if the bundle is a user's private application, he can just
'cp new bundle/old' and the element is replaced. This is why I want
a tag or signature that indicates that the bundle is not in a pristine
form.
Putting things together in an 'archive' (as you put it) is mandatory
IMO. The entire issue is that many items simply have no
significance on their own. It is only when bundled with other items
that they become significant. This can very from simple international
strings and icons, to entire application suites. Does it make sense to
have a utility that manages FooBar Document Folders when you
don't have the FooBar Application to create the document?
It is these two issues - grouping and the meta-tags you mention -
that started me on this path to begin with. The kernel shouldn't
care about the content and use of these 'bundles' beyond allowing
proper access to them. I've been pushing a definition of 'proper' as
defaulting to file system view - even while implemented as a simple
'archive'.
I've started work on a standalone application that creates and
manipulates a meta-file with tags. Hopefully I'll get it done this
weekend and post it so people can play with the idea. It won't be
complete as you cannot execute an application from within it,
but it should point out what can be done using the meta idea (pun?).
[Won't be easy ... there's an air show in my backyard and I keep
running outside to watch!]
