MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES should always combination of nodes_onto() and
nodes_fold().
The reason I say that is consistency with the end cases.  That is,
we need fold in the case that no requested nodes have numbers
smaller than the weight of the cpusets mems_allowed.  At the opposite
extreme, when -all- requested node numbers are smaller than the weight
of mems_allowed, fold has no affect, so it's fine to use there.  And
for the in between cases, when some requested nodes are smaller and
some not, fold is one possible reasonable answer.  So use it everywhere
for consistency.

I hate any more special cases than I have to have -- so not that way.

All fold, all the time ;).  So this one should be 0,4-7.

Again, 0,4-7.
Weight preservation is not a goal here, and would require special cases.
If someone crams a five pound cpuset relative memory policy into a two
poound cpuset, they will likely loose weight.  What matters in that
case is that things plod along without too much distress, and that
when the job is restored to a proper size cpuset, its memory policies
recover their full health.
