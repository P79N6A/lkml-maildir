ok, thanks.
I have to admit, since I don't know MIPS assembly, the guys at Sicortex.com developed
this function.

This code is used as a primitive to perform software memory scrubbing.
We (many people as I remember) had a discussion a couple of years ago on lkml on this, 
so this is where this implementation pattern came from.
It might be that your thought just could be correct now after some more research.
