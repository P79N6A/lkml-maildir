Price: $12.00
This book is an essential guide for the seasoned dating
man who needs help organizing the women in his life.
Women are constantly grabbing your interest and attention.
Do you have to choose on over the other? Of Course not!
Stop letting opportunities like these go to waste.
Why not date them all?
This is a must-read for men who are active on the dating
scene. Not only will you learn how to juggle several
females at a time, you will also improve your overall
chances with women, including where to meet them and
how to do the little things to keep them happy.
You will learn time-saving techniques that will maximize
your availability, and allow you to spend time with several
ladies a day. The author details scheduling methods so you
never have two dates at the same time. You will also learn
money-saving tips so you can date aggressively and still
have money left to buy life's other necessities.
Forget the saying,"For every man there is a woman out
there." Now it will be, "For every man there are at
least three women."
