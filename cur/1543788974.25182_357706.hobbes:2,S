Well, unfortunately it doesn't appear to report anythign helpful. The
maximum latency report did not change when the xrun occurred. This was
the last one reported and it happened long before the xrun:
(          ardour-8101 |#0): new 22 us maximum-latency critical section.

What next? IRQ-off possibly? I think it may be broken for AMD64 right now.
