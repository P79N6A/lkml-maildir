I mean, subject to more review, testing, input from stakeholders and blah,
I'd be OK with merging the CKRM core fairly aggressively.  With just a
minimal controller suite.  Because it is good to define the infrastructure
and APIs for task grouping and to then let the controllers fall into place.
The downside to such a strategy is that there is a risk that nobody ever
gets around to implementing useful controllers, so it ends up dead code. 
I'd judge that the interest in resource management is such that the risk of
this happening is low.
