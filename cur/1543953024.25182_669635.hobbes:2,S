I think you're semantically testing the wrong thing.
It's not if unaligned accesses are supported, it's if they are
efficient enough or not.
For example, sparc64 fully handles unaligned accesses but taking the
trap to fix it up is slow.  So sparc64 "can" handle unaligned
accesses, but whether we want to set this symbol or not is another
matter.
