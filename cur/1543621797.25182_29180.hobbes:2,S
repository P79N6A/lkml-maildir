Subject: The ptrace() bug...

Version 2.2.0 (at least) to 2.4.14-pre7 contain this line in
mm/memory.c:copy_page_range:
    unsigned long cow = (vma->vm_flags & (VM_SHARED | VM_MAYWRITE)) == VM_MAYWRITE;
Version 2.4.14-pre8 and later changed this line with:
    unsigned long cow = (vma->vm_flags & (VM_SHARED | VM_WRITE)) == VM_WRITE;
This line decides if copy-on-write should be active in a vm_area just
after a fork. The latter is more correct IMHO, with one exception:
it breaks ptraced programs, because programs been ptraced can see their
pages modified without having the VM_WRITE flag, and this causes that
both the parent and the child may see their pages changed (copy-on-write
doesn't work).
Reverting that one-line patch solves many problems for me and I think
there are no other side-effects...
Could it be included in 2.4?
Thanks,
