   What was the change trying to achieve?  What was wrong with
   flush_dcache_page(page)?
The wrong page was being passed to flush_dcache_page().  'page'
is not what is being written to with kernel cpu stores.
The real problem is that Alan stuck the raw 2.4.x version of
the fix into 2.5, it compiled on x86 because the argument
doesn't get evaluated, so we just need to fix it up :-)
And as Andrew stated, there are many other problems with the
ramdisk driver in 2.5.x
