So, you are telling me that even though OpenAFS has a license
substationally similiar in intent to the GPLv2, that it's not legal to
load into the kernel, even though the OpenAFS code predates the Linux
kernel by about 5 years? Are you going to personally sue me if I put up
an initramfs image with the OpenAFS kernel module in it?
This is not a binary-only linux-only module we are talking about here.
This is a cross-platform code that loads into multiple different
operating system kernels and has the same sort of protection of user's
right to modify the code that Linux does. It only differs in some of the
details.
My home directory is in AFS. And if you want me to help make the kernel
AFS client full-featured, I need to have both kAFS and OpenAFS loaded
and mounted at the same time. So quit bitching about OpenAFS and get out of
my way so I can work on kAFS.
