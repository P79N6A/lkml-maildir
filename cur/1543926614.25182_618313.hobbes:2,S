Just for the minutes. Problem solved. It was caused by wrong e820 information 
from the BIOS:

That one overlaps with e0000000-efffffff which is the resource that 
then leads to this:

Yep.

I compiled a debug kernel with lots of verbosity about PCI. That then 
reported:
<7>  got res [120000000:12fffffff] bus [120000000:12fffffff] flags 1208 for 
BAR 2 of 0000:00:02.0
<7>PCI: moved device 0000:00:02.0 resource 2 (1208) to 20000000
I guess that explains it a bit. Looks like with the "move" also the bytes that 
lspci -xx prints out are affected. 
Anyway, after we had enough information about what range was giving us 
problems the BIOS development was able to find and fix  the bug quite 
quickly. Installed new BIOS and problem was gone. :-)
Thanks anyway for the comments.
