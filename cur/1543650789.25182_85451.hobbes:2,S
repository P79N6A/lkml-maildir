What is the read performance like?
write performance isn't the end-all be-all of useful benchmarks, because 
most servers do far more reading in a day than they will ever write. 
 And like Andrew has pointed out on more than one occasion, reads are 
usually synchronous, because applications are typically blocking until 
each read is satisfied.
