Nope. It cannot be correct if it breaks compatibility without giving us
any advantage.

Yes, as SINGLE argument. Therefore, Perl programs break if they use this
procedure recommended by "man perlrun".
I don't care WHY it works everywhere else, I want this incompatibility
fixed and I'm not going through a flame war as with the 4.4BSD
SIOCGIFNETMASK issue again. This is not negotiable.
BTW, 2.2 is also affected.
Think of someone using /usr/bin/env -i /path/to/program -- won't work on
Linux, but works on FreeBSD.
I cannot see technical reasons why this should remain unfixed.
We have enough braindead frivulous incompatibilities in Linux.

Nope, zsh as /bin/sh complains as well:
/bin/sh: no such option:  # _*_ perl _*_ _T
so does pdksh:
/bin/sh: /bin/sh: --: unknown option
