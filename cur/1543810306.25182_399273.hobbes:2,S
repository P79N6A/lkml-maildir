Personally I'd simply advocate plain text attachments. One thing though; 
if you are going to, please make note of the long (long) standing bug in 
TB that has it send all attachments (including plaintext ones) Base64 
encoded when the outgoing encoding is set to UTF-8.
I do normally have outgoing set to UTF-8 and for example forgot to 
disable that earlier today when I sent an OOPS as an attachment. You 
don't immediately notice this yourself, since TB simply decodes it again 
when viewing...
Rene.
