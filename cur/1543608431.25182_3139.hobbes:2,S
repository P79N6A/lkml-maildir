I got confused by the kernel /reading/ the CMOS clock,
and the symptoms the original reporter suggested (see
subject line). My symptoms came from non-APM driven
suspend (hence high time offset, no clock/hwclock
invocation) and writing back system clock to cmos clock
on shutdown, AND ntp not adjusting if the date difference
is greater than some small value AND ntpdate not being
able to get to any time server including the CMOS clock
when it was run; sigh...

The kernel does read from the rtc to support /dev/rtc, and in
the apm code. AIUI that's why the kernel needs to know
via config whether your RTC is in UTC (else that could
be done in userspace too). You are probably correct that
it doesn't write to it.

Summary:
1. ntpd (as opposed to xntpd) doesn't seem to support the rtc,
   as a clock source, at least not in the same way.
2. suspending your laptop in a manner other than using apm
   doesn't do good things to the RTC when you later shut
   the machine down, with standard scripts.
3. Check your ntpdate on init is doing what you think it's
   doing.
