     As I mentioned in previous mail to account quotas in
   bytes and not in blocks (needed for reiserfs) I need to
   know something like i_blocks but in bytes. So I added
   field i_bytes to inode. This field is used along with
   i_blocks and means (number of used bytes) % 512 (size
   of block used in i_blocks).
     This solution has advantage that we added only 16-bits
   to structure and we needn't to update any block oriented
   filesystem...
     Another thing needed is to propagate somehow this entry
   to struct stat so quotacheck may account bytes properly.
   Whom should I ask to propagate needed changes to libc?
This is bogus!  What's wrong with the existing i_size and st_size
fields?
