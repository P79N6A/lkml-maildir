Can you please boot the kernel in the minimal configuration (init=/bin/bash)
and try to hibernate, ie.
# mount /proc
# mount /sys
# swapon -a
# echo disk > /sys/power/state
Also, please check if anything changes if you do
# echo shutdown > /sys/power/disk
before the last command above.
Greetings,
Rafael
