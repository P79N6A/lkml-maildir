Works fine on the hardware that started the whole thing.  This one requires
CONFIG_CPU_FREQ turned off (otherwise the keyboard freezes).  Stephen
Hemminger's required CONFIG_CPU_FREQ to be set (otherwise the keyboard
froze in this case as well, not being able to register interrupts), 
which made less sense.
good work.
