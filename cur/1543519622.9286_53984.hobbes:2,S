Hi David,
Thanks for the heads up.
Is this forked codebase planned to be brought back together in the future?
I don't wish to step on anyones toes, but I though it would be good to have
all of the modules in the kernel, leaving just the userspace tools (cardmgr,
cardctl etc) in pcmcia-cs.
Currently the driver for my wireless network (ray_cs) is found in the
kernel, but not in pcmcia-cs (it must be downloaded separately), but I need
to build pcmcia-cs to get the userspace tools, and depending on the order in
which I build and install the kernel and pcmcia-cs, the other modules are
different ... very confusing for users
Does this make any sense?
