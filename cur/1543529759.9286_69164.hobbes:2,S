I have an interesting problem.  This card and this drivers has worked
flawlessly for some time.  The machine in question has been up for 130 and
after about 10 minutes or less, the card quits talking.  I see no errors,
ifconfig eth0 down;ifconfig eth0 up fixes it.
Any ideas?  (before I yank it and replace it?)
