Sorry but I am having a hard time understanding this comment.
Are you saying 2.4 causes applications to send I/O requests
longer than the hardware accepts, and if applications are
properly written they should be able to limit the continuous
requests from the userland (which means it is an application
bug)?  Or are you saying 2.4 kernel should not ``cause longer
continuous I/O requests to be sent'' but it ends up doing
so (which means its a kernel bug)?
