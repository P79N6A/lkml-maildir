Sounds alarming. Linus didn't take documentation updates from designated 
maintainer? For many months? I can't believe in argument that updates were 
able to break _anything_, it's only documentation, right? I could understand 
this if these updates were sent by little known person, but Eric?!
Clearly a scalability problem here :-)
I won't post to this thread more.
Why? It's a flamewar, more _words_ will do nothing. _Action_ is needed.
