Aha. They are mostly equivalent, except that I missed low-level stuff on
x86 and you left release_segments() in the blocking part (why?). Plus in
several places I used mm_count when you did mm_users. Fine with me.
Non-obvious difference: destroy_context() is gone in your version. Methink
we'ld better leave it around... Probably it's a question to DaveM - all
non-trivial context stuff sits in sun4c.c and srmmu.c.
Another thing: checks in binfmt_{elf,aout,whatnot}.c (is it dumpable?)
should go into the top-level code. Otherwise we'll spend the eternity
trying to resync all copies. I'll do it if you have no objections. And it
starts to smell like we would be better off with a kernel/mm.c instead of
all having the context-related stuff scattered over the tree. Comments?

Same here ;-)

I really don't see where it helps, but it definitely doesn't hurt. No
objections here.
