In the meantime I've applied Tim's patch because it is definitely
a step in the right direction and the current 2.6.x behavior makes
no sense at all :-)
We can add a fix on top to make 2.6.x behave more closely to 2.4.x
(by sharing numbers between v4 and v6).  If that proves to be very
difficult to do, it's not absolutely critical to preserve this behavior
I think.
