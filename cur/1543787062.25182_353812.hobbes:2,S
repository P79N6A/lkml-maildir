About the priority inversion and running the debugger at higher priority
then the debuggee, that's a moot point. You're still doing too many
pointless context switches to the debugger only to do nothing and switch
back to the debuggee.

Since when did ptrace become a security barrier? If security is the only
concern, then we can always add a capability check to only allow root to
set SA_NOPRNOTIF on sigaction() for a particular signal.
Besides, putting this responsibility (ignore SIGCHLDs for signal X from
Task Y) in the debugger requires the debugger to have information about
the debuggee, like Task Y is special for handling signal X, and I'm
going to ptrace() ignore SIGCHLD's from Task Y.
See where I'm going with this?
That's why I specifically put the responsibility on the debuggee to say:
I know what I'm doing and I don't want the debugger to be notified about
this specific signal.
