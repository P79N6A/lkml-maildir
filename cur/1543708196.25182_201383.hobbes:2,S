You are preaching to the choir when it comes to code like that.
However, even lint allows it! I first thought it was a GNUism
just like void-pointer math being allowed. But, when Lint says
it's okay, I don't think there is any technical reason for
not allowing it because Lint is the most pedantic of pedantica.
