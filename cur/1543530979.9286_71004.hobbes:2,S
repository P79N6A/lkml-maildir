Management nagging about supporting more pages, worried by waste of several
Gb of disk that has never, ever been touched. System is sluggish, needs
constant tweaking of "resource allocation quotas" as applications crash,
even there are resources available. Seriously consider firing inept
sysadmin.

Other customers are unhappy because of long download times, NS (or
whatever) crashing, not getting to the site because of (local or remote)
network congestion. The "catastrophe" isn't even a blip on the sysadmin's
screen.
