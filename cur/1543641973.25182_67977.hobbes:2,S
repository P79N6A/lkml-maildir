OK, Linus, you are right... there are enough instances of this we are
not going to find them all (although I suspect Andrew's slab.c fixes
will cover most of the cases).  Further, I think we can should actually
purposely call preempt_schedule() in certain cases after interrupt
reenable to check for reschedules...
Let's just make it a rule "no preemption if interrupts are off" and
enforce that.
Patch is against 2.5.33-BK, please apply.
