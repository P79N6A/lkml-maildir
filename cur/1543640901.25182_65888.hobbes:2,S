Dave,
What is your definition of a "very long time" ?
Read the 1st email.  There were 2.4 million samples.
How many do you think is sufficient ?

Why do you think oprofile is a better way to measure this ?
BTW, Mala works with Troy Wilson who is running SPECweb99 on

What is the revelance of the above ?

Based on what ?  A callgraph ? A profile ?
