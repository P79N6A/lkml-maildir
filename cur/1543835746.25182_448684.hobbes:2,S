Sure, and on the other hand, it might work (seemingly) perfectly, as it 
has done in the past, and will continue to do so as long as the owner 
wishes it to.

Or a driver change can hurt me *right now*, by leaving my system without 
connectivity.

I'm now seeing this problem with a Thinkpad T23. I have a second T23 I can 
test, and will try to do so tonight.
I second the request to at least have a driver option to ignore checksum 
failures.

Let's assume that these things are all true, and the NIC currently does 
not work perfectly, just imperfectly, but acceptably. With the recent 
driver change, it now does not work at all. That's surely a bug in the 
driver.
