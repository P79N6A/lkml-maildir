Is your argument that syslog is not suitable for the logging of hw events?
If that is your argument then the answer is to extend syslog with those 
aspects, instead of widening the quirky /dev based mce ABIs to achieve 
something similar.
If you think that it's suitable then that contradicts your point above.

For me the main blocking point is that mcelog uses a quirky, binary 
side-channel instead of using our main ASCII based logging abstraction 
that we have in Linux: printk + syslog.
That is a high level argument, while most of your arguments are low level. 
I dont think you can understand my argument if you concentrate on the low 
level only.
We need to resolve this instead of expanding the broken /dev/mcelog 
interface. If we expand the broken interface first then that removes all 
the incentives to enhance the primary logging facility of Linux in this 
area.
Anyway, this merge window has been very crowded in the x86 space already, 
and the MCE topic is not particularly super-important to have right now 
either, so lets skip it for this cycle so that we have more time to 
cleanly work out these details.
Let me know if there are must-have fixes in it and we can cherry-pick it 
over into x86/urgent.
Thanks,
