Is the problem with the drive on the promise board or the drive on the
VIA chipset?
(from google)
Soyo SY-7VBA133U VIA 694T SY-7VBA133U : ComputerHQ.com3
... Main Specifications. Product Description, SOYO Socket 370
SY-7VBA133U - mainboard -
ATX - Pro133T. ... Audio Output, Sound card - VIA VT82C686B - 16-bit -
stereo. ...
I have the -EXACT- same chipset on an older Soyo Motherboard and have
the same problem you are having, the motherboard did not support drives
over 32GB or it was because I had the 32GB clip (pins on the back of the
hard drive) shorted.  Did you check your HDD manual to see if you have
the 32GB clip enabled?  If so, you need to disable this.
Justin.
