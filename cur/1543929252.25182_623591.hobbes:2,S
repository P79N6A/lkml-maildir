As long as you aren't talking about the subthread that spun off
about GPL exports, and just the rest of my patches and showing
where I am going that sounds reasonable.

Honestly I think there is a reasonable chance we could kill
sysfs_mount and the kern_mount entirely.  We used to need  the
internal kernel mount because of the coupling between sysfs_dirent
and the directory dentries but that is gone now.
So basically the variable sysfs_mount is static because sysfs_mount
used to be simply global I changed it to be static, and I haven't
looked at optimization opportunities beyond that.
So as long as we are using sysfs_mount less and don't get in
the way of multiple superblocks for sysfs I'm happy.
