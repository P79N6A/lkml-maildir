Ah, stupid me. I had compiled a kernel without CONFIG_KMOD, which
prevents on-demand loading of modules. still, there should really be a
check in the config stuff to prevent you from asking for PPP as a
module if CONFIG_KMOD is not set. Unlike some other modularized code,
PPP clearly does not work as a module without KMOD.
