Ah, sorry if I was not clear.  What I was trying to show was that you can compare "gh" to "cpupri" to see the effects of the 2-d patch in isolation (*) in Steven's tests.  I believe it shows a positive impact on some tests, and a negligible impact on some tests.  As long as we dont have a regression somewhere, I am happy :)
(*) Yes, "cpupri" in this test also has patches 21-22 (root-domain).  However, note that Steven is not configuring cpusets, and therefore the root-domain code is effectively marginalized in this data.  Its not a pure isolation, no.  But the results of my tests with *true* isolation present similar characteristics, so I felt they were representative.

Understood and agree.  I designed the subsystem with the overall system in mind, so hopefully that is reflected in the numbers and the review comments that come out of this. :)

Sounds good.  Ill try to dig up my 4/8-way numbers as well for another data point.
Thanks for taking the time to review all this stuff.  I know you are swamped these days.
