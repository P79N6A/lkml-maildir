Hi all,
I discovered that on my MSI-6330 with AMD Duron with a VIA KT 133 and
RedHat 6.2 with gcc-2.95.2 and latest binutils whenever I try to
bootstrap gcc again that sometimes the compiler sig11s.
This isn't depending on something else, sometimes it bootstraps and
sometimes not. The system is unchanged during those tests.
The machine is not overclocked and bios settings are very conservative.
Anyone experienced similar problems ?
With best regards
Michael Meding
