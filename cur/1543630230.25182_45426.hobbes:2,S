Subject: mapping from scsi Host/Chan/Id/Lun to /dev/foo

I'm trying to write a userspace program that takes Host/Chan/Id/Lun
arguments for some sort of scsi storage device and prints out the
corresponding /dev entry, if one exists.
This is easy to do with devfs... assuming SCSI 0 0 0 0, the program can 
simply look in /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/ for 'cd' or 'disc', etc.
Without devfs, though, I can't figure out how to map 0 0 0 0 to /dev/scd0,
/dev/sr0, or /dev/sda, etc.
I hope I haven't missed anything obvious in the ioctl commands in the .h 
files, /proc, etc...
I'm not subscribed to LKML, so I would appreciate it if you'd Cc me in 
your reply!
Thanks!
