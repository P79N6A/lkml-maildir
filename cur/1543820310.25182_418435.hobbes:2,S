Can you name any reasons for why should we support C++ in the kernel?
Why shouldn't we invest the effort to making it possible to write kernel
modules in Haskell instead?
The kernel is written in C and its maintainers have so far agreed that
C is enough and adding any other language brings more pain than gain.
If you think otherwise, feel free to submit some real code which shows
the advantages of using a different language.
