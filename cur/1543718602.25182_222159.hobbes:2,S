I don't know what kind of system you're running on, but if it's a
multi-CPU Opteron, it is normally a sufficient fudge to just use
sched_setaffinity to bind individual processes to specific CPUs.  The
mainline kernel memory allocator does the right thing in that case, and
allocates memory locally when it can.
You can use the taskset command to get at this from the command line, so
you may not even need to modify your code.
