This gives me the following compile error:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      drivers/infiniband/core/user_mad.o
drivers/infiniband/core/user_mad.c:587: warning: 'class_device_attr_dev' defined but not used
...
<--  snip  -->
Reverting this patch fixes the warning (but I don't know about the 
underlying issues).
