Hey rafael,
For obvious reasons it would be great to have serial output to be the last to enter suspend, thus giving every last drop of debugging
before actually turning the machine "off".
I'm not aware of any specific order currently, from what I've seen currently  every driver is asked to go into suspend at the same time. This of course providing driver x isn't dependant on driver y. You following?
So, without digging to much into this, is there any specific order?
Best wishes
Kristoffer
