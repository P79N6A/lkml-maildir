I would 'suggest' that before you post another "statement" like this,
you compile your favorite kernel snippet with the `-S` option and look
at the generated code.
Then 'tidy' up something so it looks good to 'humans' and do the same
thing again. You will then learn why there are strange constructs and,
as you say, a 1000 gotos.
The processor sees the generated code. It does not see the 'C' source.
When you follow the main instruction path, you will note a minimum of
changes in program-flow. This is why there are some many gotos. Also
you will often see code that doesn't seem to make any sense. Look at
the assembly and you will find that there was a very good reason for
it.
Cheers,
