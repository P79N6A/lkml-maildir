No. 
1. CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW and CLOCK_MONOTONIC are diffferent beasts
2. CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW was created to allow user space to read out the
non NTP frequency corrected raw system time. That's mainly for the NTP
folks so they have a better idea what's the hardware's idea of time
is.

That's what I just sent out :) I looked into this offline and had the
fix ready to send out when I noticed yours.
