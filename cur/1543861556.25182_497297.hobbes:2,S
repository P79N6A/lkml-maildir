Hi Linus,
Can you please pull the 'drm-patches' branch from
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git drm-patches
It only contains one fix for an error printout that was unwise.
Dave.

     i915: Fix a DRM_ERROR that should be DRM_DEBUG.
     It would clutter up the kernel output in a situation which is legitimate before
     X.org 7.2 and handled correctly by the 3D driver.
