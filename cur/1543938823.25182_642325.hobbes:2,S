The commonality I imagine is not in what sorts of reports they create,
or where they complete the formatting for and end-user.  It is solely
whether the kernel-side instrumentation sites can be represented by
individual markers, so that these particular tools as well as future
ones don't need to keep inserting custom code in similar or even the
same places.
