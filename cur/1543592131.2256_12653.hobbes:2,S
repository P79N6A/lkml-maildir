I get the same with egcs. To me it sounds broken VM (I shouldn't have
changed anything that can confuse the VM so this should be reproducible
with 2.4.5pre5 vanilla and infact you also said you reproduced
previously in 2.4.4).
Is it possible you booted with 'mem=something'? It seems to me that when
I boot with 'mem=something' the VM bad beahaviour become more visible.

definitely a good idea until somebody fixes the VM in mainline.
