GLPv2 doesn't: why do you think the digital signature is an integral 
part of the executable? It can be a totally separate blob, distributed 
via a separate channel and even stored at a different location than the 
executable. Does it still look like an integral part of the executable 
to you then?
(unless of course you're trying to argue that the hash itself is a 
derivative work, but that has already been refuted many times before.)

It works just fine given the right environment. The right environment 
may be some other hardware (without DRM restrictions) or the DRMed 
device + an authorized digital signature. The digital signature is not 
part of your executable.
Do you honestly believe GPLv2 requires the distributor to provide you 
with the right environment for your modified copy to "function 
properly"? I would say it doesn't, but feel free to point me to specific 
sections which *state* otherwise. AFAICT, GPLv2 is specifically limited 
to "copying, distribution and modification". How you use (or don't use, 
or can't use) your modified copy is totally outside its scope.
