However, it's also true that the thing BK is _worst_ at is cherry-picking 
things, and having a collection of stuff where somebody may end up vetoing 
one patch and saying "remove that one".
So it's entirely possible that the proper tool to use for the first level 
is not BK at all, but the evolved patch-scripts that Andrew uses, in other 
words:
	
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt
may well be a much better thing to use.
I love BK, but what BK does well is merging and maintaining trees full of 
good stuff. What BK sucks at is experimental stuff where you don't know 
whether something should be eventually used or not.
