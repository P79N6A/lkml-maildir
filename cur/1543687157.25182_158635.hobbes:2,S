Well, in theory you could fiddle with its memory map and force it to 
soft-fault all its pages back in, and count the soft faults.  But I know just 
enough about that to suspect it's a rast nest of evil complexity and loss of 
orthogonality.
Another thing is if it's calling the same syscalls in sequence with the same 
arguments...  (What syscalls IS it calling?)
Looking at the profile list you gave earlier, schedule is showing up.  If the 
sucker's calling schedule in the loop, that should be a heck of a hint that 
it's busy-waiting, dontcha think?
As long as you've got a queue for each priority, how about having an "I called 
schedule" queue?  (Or can you re-queue it somewhere lower than its actual 
priority?  How about one queue lower than the queue was on when it called 
schedule, without necessarily changing its dynamic priority...)
What DOES calling "schedule" from userspace mean with the current scheduler?
