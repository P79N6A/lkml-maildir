Hello,
  I just upgraded to Red Hat 7.0 from 6.2, and I am now trying to build
kernel-2.4.5.
After executing bzImage, at "Install db development libraries" I got the
following error:
  aicasm_symbol.c:39:19: acidb.h: No such file or directory
  make[5]: *** [aicasm] Error 1
  make[5]: Leaving diectory
`/usr/src/linux-2.4.5/linux/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aicasm
There is apparently a header file needed. How do I fix this? Is there a
patch?
I also noticed some warnings, something to the effect, cdrom.c pasting
would not give a valid
preprocessing token. What is this?
Also, I configured this for a Pentium MMX processor, but I noticed that
in .config the kernel is built
for 586MXX but the machine has dual 300 MHz Pentium II 686.
Here is the output from "sh scripts/ver_linux
