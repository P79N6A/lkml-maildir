well, just power it on, it seems.  but then again, this is just a guess.

doesn't look it:
[root@nsv6 /root]# ifconfig lo
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback  
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0

that may very well be, but shouldn't the neighbor solisitation packets
from the linux box have the source mac address set to its mac address
and the destination mac address set to 0:0:0:0:0:0 and not the other way
