The expansion of the acronym doesn't fit anymore to what SCSI is today,
or even to what it became already circa 10 years ago.

Right.  I wrote that in lack of better words, but at least I added "SCSI
commands" in parentheses.  Something like "SCSI I/O - core and command
sets" would much better describe what it is, but it would put "SCSI"
first again and thus wouldn't reflect that  Linux' SCSI core and
highlevel is in broader use than just for actual SCSI hardware...  Of
course there is no way around the issue that Linux' SCSI core's and
highlevel's role cannot be characterized in 3...6 words only, but there
should be a way to point out its general importance.

Wrong comparison.
