I modify the initscripts to not try to fsck and remount the root --
its a ramfs (tmpfs in a later version) after all.  If I had been
mounting a filesystem off the harddisk I would either have mounted it
readonly and left the init scripts as-is, or fscked it before
mounting.
I pass the following command line options to the kernel (this is set
up in isolinux.cfg):
        append initrd=initrd.gz root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc single
By specifying root=/dev/ram0 and an explicit init (which I'm calling
/linuxrc but could just as easily have called /sbin/init) I'm telling
the kernel that this is the final root, and effectively turn off most
of the initrd legacy weirdness.
If /sbin/init exits, the kernel panics, just like it would normally do
if init goes away.
