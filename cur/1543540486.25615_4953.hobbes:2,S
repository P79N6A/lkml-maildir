The reason you don't see that in the 2.4.0-test4 tree is that there is
nothing to see.
A good PCI driver will _automatically_ support the equivalent cardbus
card. I use tulip.c on my VAIO all the time, and it works quite well. No
cardmgr needed at all, in fact.
The old notion of having separate drivers for CardBus and PCI was always
broken. CardBus is just PCI with hotplug capabilities (and some
backwards compatibility cruft to handle 16-bit cards - which don't look
anything like PCI at all and sharing a driver wouldn't work).
In fact, the tulip driver was the first to be converted to the new PCI
interfaces, and has worked this way for quite some time.
