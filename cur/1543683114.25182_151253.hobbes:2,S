Hi people,
When pressing one or but times right key CTRL (not left CTRL or others),
at the moment of the beginning of kernel, exactly after the
decompression of this and before extinguished of the key numlock (I
suppose that he is keyboard boot), when kernel finishes starting, the
keyboard responds as if this key was pressed, such as letters, numbers
not appears in console when clicked.
The solution is to touch some keys like ctrl, alt, shift simultaneusly
among others randomly and returns to respond normally.
this is expectable, or is bug?
The kernel is 2.4.21 and the same it happens with 2.4.22-pre , and with
other machines of my friends, not happens with 2.6.0-test1.
Thanks in advance, and sorry my english.
arrivederci, djgera
