I submitted the ppp_synctty patch and these macros were included.
These extra bits may just be perculating through the process. If they
don't show up by the official 2.3.24, I'll send out a query.
Something this brings up is that the line discipline array
is about to be exhausted (16 slots, now with 15 ldisc). It looks to
be a simple matter to increase this, any suggestions on the new
size (20? 32?..) and when it should be changed (now, wait for
2.5.x, or not at all)?
