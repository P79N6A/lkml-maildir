Interesting -- this seems to be the only card of the set that actually has
drivers available for download, although the D-Link card has drivers for
an older GigE card listed.
According to the drivers, the 1000TPC uses the NS DP83820.  According to
the DP83820's datasheet, it has a 8k Tx buffer and a 32k Rx buffer.
That's a bit shy of the 512k-1M that older cards use :-(.  At wire speed,
that means that you'll have to service the NIC's interrupt within ~60 us
on transmit and ~250 us on receive.  That seems rather optimistic.
