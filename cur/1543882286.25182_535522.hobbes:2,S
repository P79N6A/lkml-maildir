You want to change the block layer to support larger blocksize than 
PAGE_SIZE right? So you need to segment that larger block into pieces.

You could f.e. switch off defragmentation and the large block support?

Ahh. I knew we were going this way.... Now we have virtual contiguous vs. 
physical discontiguous.... Yuck hackidihack.

Yes but the processor supports 4k also. I'd rather have a choice. 16k is a 
choice for performance given the current kernel limitations hat wastes 
lots of memory.
