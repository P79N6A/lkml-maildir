Yes, that was inherited from SCSI.  Previously it just cleared flags and then 
set REQ_BARRIER|REQ_SPECIAL.  Now I needed to clear flags but preserve the 
state of REQ_QUEUED, which is what that code is doing, otherwise the 
blk_rq_tagged() would always fail lower down.

I'm happy (as long as it works on my SCSI card).
