Subject: [PATCH libata-dev-2.6 00/03] libata: scsi error handling improvements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These patches are a resubmit of patch 5/5 of the first series
submitted 2005-03-17.  Jeff requested that the single patch be split
into a suggested 3 smaller patches; the results are below.  I also
took this opportunity to further clean up the changes.
[ Start of patch descriptions ]
01_libata_libata-whitespace.patch
	: whitespace updates
	This patch adjusts some whitespace to bring the format of
	libata-scsi.c to a consistent state.
02_libata_ata_dump_status.patch
	: create/use ata_dump_status()
	This patch introduces the ata_dump_status() function, which
	for now is called from ata_to_sense_error() only.
03_libata_rework-cc-generation.patch
	: rework check condition handling
	This patch refactors the check condition creation within
	libata.  Changes include:
	- ata_to_sense_error() now *only* performs the translation
          from an ATA status/error register combination to a SCSI
          SK/ASC/ASCQ combination.  Additionally, the translation is
          logged at level KERNEL_ERR and any untranslatable combos are
          logged at level KERNEL_WARNING.
	- ata_dump_status() is modified to take a taskfile struct as
          argument in preparation for a future patch which will add
          proper display of the failing location (LBA or CHS)
	- created ata_gen_fixed_sense() to generate a fixed length CC
          sense block.
	- ata_pass_thru_cc() has been renamed to
          ata_gen_ata_desc_sense() to fit the naming convention
          mentioned above.  Its guts were changed a bit as well.
	- ata_scsi_qc_complete() has been modified to fix a bug where
          ATA_12/16 commands would not generate a sense block on
          error.  Other changes made here as well, including the call
          to ata_dump_status().
