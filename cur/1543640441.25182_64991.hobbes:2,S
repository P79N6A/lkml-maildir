I really think this is a bad idea.  The kmsg device has different 
properties -- for example, you're supposed to tag things with the 
message importance.  It really matches the syslog(3) interface better. 
Also, the special case makes me nervous.
The "DoS opportunity" is a complete and utter red herring.  If you have 
permission to write /dev/kmsg then you have permission to write 
/dev/kmem too!
