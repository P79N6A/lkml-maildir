Hi. I've already contacted CMD wheter they have a linux driver for this
controller.. 
The guy, who unswared my question say that he "heard" of semebody writing
a linux driver..
If there really is somebody.. he probably reads this list.. this is why
I'm writing...  but anyways... does anybody have some experience wuth this
stuff under linux???
