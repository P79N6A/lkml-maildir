No, that is to allow queueing of callbacks from irq context - see
call_rcu(). Since the queues are per-CPU, we don't need any spinlock.
rcu_process_callbacks() is always invoked from the RCU per-CPU tasklet,
so preemption doesn't come into picture. But irq disabling is needed
so that it doesn't race with call_rcu().
Only preemption related issue with RCU is that in the reader
side (in your case traversing the nmi handler list for invocation),
there should not be any preemption (not possible anyway in your case).
This is achieved by rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() which essentially
disables/enables preemption.
The idea is that if you get preempted while holding reference to
some RCU protected data, it is not safe to invoke the RCU callback.
Once you get preempted, you can run on a different CPU and keeping
track of the preempted tasks become difficult. Besides preempted
tasks with low priority can delay RCU update for long periods.
Hence the disabling of preemption which is not worse than locks.

Yes.
