Ok, so we have the following allocation possibilities.
1. allocate task_struct+thread_info+stack together.
2. allocate task_struct and thread_info+stack.
3. allocate task_struct+thread_info and stack.
1. is what we have so far and I hope Linus actually means a
task_struct/stack split. Linus, could you please clarify?
Architectures without a thread register want either the first or second
option. I don't really have an opinion, whether the first option should
be made obsolete. For architectures with a thread register the third
option makes most sense and is not really a problem, we only have to
specify the dependency between task_struct and thread_info.
bye, Roman
