I builds just fine with and without HDLC.
The only problem is defining synclink as built in
while defining hdlc as a module.
This patch *breaks* the driver.
My previous attempts (and those of others who suggested
different fixes) at preventing this kernel
misconfiguration were all rejected. I tried
repeatedly over many weeks.
I think purposefully breaking a driver while rejecting
fixes to the real problem is a bad idea.
