I don't believe the behaviour of input characters typed across that
boundary is defined by the standards at all. That said I think the
behaviour you expect is reasonable.

You could recompute minimum in this case but zero is definitely
incorrect. I think what you would actually need to do is to extract out
the code just below do_it_again: which computes minimum and recompute it
properly.
