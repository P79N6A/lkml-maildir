A bit late, but a short report. I managed to boot into U8.1 (Athlon64 up
machine). But only if I turn off kudzu (the hardware discovery program
in FC2). If I leave it on, I get tons of kernel error or warning
messages on the console, they scroll too fast for me to read, once that
starts the machine is pretty much stuck - the messages keep scrolling
but that's about it. I have not managed to capture the output to see
what they say...
If I boot without kudzu I can use sound, but I have not done yet any
latency testing.
