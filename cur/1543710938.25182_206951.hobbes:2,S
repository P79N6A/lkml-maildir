Completely empty is what you get then... and you have to explicitly link in
each file. Or everything shows up here.

Next time you mount it, what happens? How do you know the "top files" where
deleted, and should not show up? 
What happens if I mount the live 2.6.4 kernel source over a CD containing
2.5.30? What happens to identical files, files that moved, changed files,
deleted files? Pray tell, how does the kernel find out which is which?
How do you back up a beast like this?

In any case, there are tools that create a farm of symlinks, and when you
try to write to a file (pointing to a RO area/file), you get an error. This
gives you 90% of what you want, _without_ aggravating the filesystem
hackers.

This is called BitKeeper, CVS, Subversion, arch, RCS, SCCS, ... Better yet,
it keeps the history of each file (not just the one version on RO media),
with annotations. You decide when a version is ready for archiving.
Sure, this would save disk space. But at today's prices, it just is not
worth the trouble.
