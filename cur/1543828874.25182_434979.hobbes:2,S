No, they are *not* full matches.
My case:
CF model="TRANSCEND", revision="20050811" as reported by "hdparm -I" and bios,
but
id->model="TRANSCEND",
id->fw_rev="20050811TRANSCEND"
note the trailing in id->fw_rev,
So lets look at ide_in_drive_list -- it should try to detect blacklisted revision,
so it looks for substr device_table->id_firmware in id->fw_rev.
NB: I don't know what causes id->fw_rev to be bogus (?), but maybe the right fix
NB: is to correct its initialization. Some person with IDE background should clarify this.
