So much for the "root is god" claims made earlier, then. What about iopl()
and the like? IF capabilities can be used to block this (and similar), and
Andre's "sanity checking" for ATA is added, then surely it *IS* possible
to prevent root screwing the HDD (without replacing the kernel, at which
point all bets are off, of course).

Quite the opposite of the approach some were advocating, then - give root
absolute and unconditional power to do anything, however stupid.
