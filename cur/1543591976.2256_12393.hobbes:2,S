Hello,
I have the following question for VFS gurus here:
In the inode struct, an address_space (i_data) and a pointer to an
address_space (i_mapping) are defined, and it looks like i_mapping is
always a reference to the inode's i_data (except in coda_open). Then what
is the difference of meaning between these two ?
Regards,
