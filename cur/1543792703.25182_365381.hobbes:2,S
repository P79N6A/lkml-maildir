Given the large number of possible valid configurations, I'm trying to 
determine which you are trying to fix and if that will break the others.

There are, at minimum, three possible hardware attach cases, each of 
which may be on a distribution which uses udev or not. I'm assuming that 
if this is a udev problem is would be fixed at the udev level, but your 
comment on "userspace hacks" does sound like fixes to userspace bugs.
The three attach methods are pcmcia, direct plugin slots (laptops only 
AFAIK), and USB devices.
It seems that the pcmcia cases for laptops and desktops are the same, 
and the whole media and device go away as a unit with the card. But for 
USB and direct plug-in, the "device" seems to be present even without 
media. I can't easily check that for laptop before tonight, but attached 
USB devices show up as sdX currently, with or without media. That's on 
an older kernel, I'll check 2.6.13 tonight.
