Acually I must mean the thread_info and not current.  i386 only uses a 
seperate stack if you use 4K stacks.  I think others use seperate 
interrupt stacks, however :(.  Also, on thinking on it, I think some 
archs don't call the registers pt_regs either.  Oh, well, it was a 
thought...
Waiting for its brother... :)
