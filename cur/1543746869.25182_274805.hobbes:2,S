Subject: [patch, 2.6.10-rc2-mm3, x86] fix reboot hang / APIC errors
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/26/321

the attached patch fixes SMP/x86 systems to not hang during reboot in
certain circumstances, printing out an endless stream of:
 APIC error on CPU1: 00(04)
 APIC error on CPU1: 04(04)
 APIC error on CPU1: 04(04)
The bug is this: sys_reboot() calls device_shutdown(), which calls each
registered driver and shuts it down. One of them is lapic0, which is
lethal: it will disable the local APIC on the currently executing CPU.
This is buggy in a number of ways 1) there's no guarantee that the
reboot process wont migrate to another CPU at this point (it's still a
fully functioning kernel) 2) if another CPU tries to send an cross-CPU
IPI message after this CPU's local APIC has been disabled, that other
CPU will get an infinite stream of APIC error interrupts - locking the
system up in a flood of messages. The reboot never happens.
the fix is to do what we always did: only disable the local APIC in the
very final moments, as part of the smp_send_stop() logic.
AFAICS, this is a fresh changeset that came in over the ACPI BK tree, it
has not been committed to Linus' tree yet. This bug was found via
PREEMPT_RT where the race is much more likely to trigger, but there's no
reason why this could not occur in the generic kernel.
similarly, i think it's unfortunate that the IO-APIC driver has a
shutdown handler as well - while i cannot see a bug scenario right now,
i think it's quite fragile to disable all external interrupts (including
the timer interrupt!) at this point. Again, this is best done in
machine_restart(). (which already does it.)
