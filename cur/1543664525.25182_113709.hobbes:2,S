On a heavily loaded system, --start can take quite a while if the daemon
isn't already running.  Before starting my machine-killing benchmark
(which I want to profile), I use --start-daemon which gets most of the
work out of the way.  The subsequent --start, which occurs while the
benchmark is already steaming along, will happen quickly and with much
less impact to the benchmark results.
