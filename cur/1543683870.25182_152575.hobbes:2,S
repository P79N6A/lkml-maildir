It would be unfortunate if AS and the interactivity scheduler were to 
conflict.  Is there a way we can have them talk to each other and have 
AS boost some I/O requests for tasks which are marked as interactive?
It would sacrifice some throughput for the sake of interactivity, which 
is what the interactivity patches do anyhow.  This is a reasonable 
compromise.
