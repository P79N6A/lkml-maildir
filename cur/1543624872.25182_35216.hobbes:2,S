You may want to change the above to:
#define __SLOW_DOWN_IO_ASM	"\noutb %%al,$__SLOW_DOWN_IO_PORT"
> +	outb(3, __SLOW_DOWN_IO_PORT);
You may also want to replace the above entirely with a macro, like:
#define __SLOW_DOWN_IO		outb(3, __SLOW_DOWN_IO_PORT)
so that on architectures that don't need/have this ISA nonsense can
just replace __SLOW_DOWN_IO with something else like udelay.

May as well just stick with a single define here (i.e. remove DELAY_PORT).

And use __SLOW_DOWN_IO_ASM here.
