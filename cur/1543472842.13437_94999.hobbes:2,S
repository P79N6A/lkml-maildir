Write a tiny program for the task, something like:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
main()
{
    unsigned long x; /* I'm assuming 32 bits here */
    
    x = time(NULL);
    for(;;) {
            x = 69069 * x + 1;
	    fwrite(&x, sizeof(x), 1, stdout);
    }
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
(The 69069 is _not_ random here; check Knuth's "The Art of Computer
Programming", vol2 for theory and explanation).
There are faster methods, but I'd guess that the I/O time swamps everything
else. Perhaps fiddling with using putc_unlocked(3) to avoid other overheads
might be warranted...
Hope this helps.
