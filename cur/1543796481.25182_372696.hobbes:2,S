is there an URL to these?

usually such modules are extremely low maintenance once merged.... There
are many many drivers without a maintainer, and they still get fixed.

which is still there even in the latest 2.6.15-rc. It should be going
out but hasn't yet. And that is the case for at least a year (eg they
are __deprecated but still there).

Most of those were already in the final place with a temporary compat
header in the old one I guess. But if this is all.... that really isn't
a big deal. I suspect some of these headers aren't even used by the
