Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/4] unify both copies of build_zonelists()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

There are currently two copies of build_zonelists(): one
for NUMA systems, and one for flat systems.  The following
patches make the NUMA case work for the flat case as well.
This set is a little more thorough than the single patch
I posted last week.
I'd like these to get a run in -mm if there aren't any
objections.
