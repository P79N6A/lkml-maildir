Frank,
you can't possibly mean to write greater parts of the kernel in C++?
That language is just at too high a level to do that poking in hw
registers and designing time critical paths with. You need assembler and
C for that. Compilation results must be foreseeable as most as they
possibly can. If you look at the tweaking that is done in time critical
areas of the kernel (look for 'odd looking' goto's), what would that
exten(d/t?) to if c++ were used? You can even try using Java for the
kernel. You have too little control over the code generation, and if you
can gain it somehow, then the tweaking necessary will be _much_ uglier
than it is now.
I believe low-level software should be written in a low-level language.
