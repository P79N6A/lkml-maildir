Hi all,
   First of all sorry for bringing this topic again.
As discussed in  --> 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/5/47
The ATA Streaming feature set is not necessary to be in Kernel Space
(IDE driver). There is a suggestion creating user space library.
But how is the user space apps going to use the commands like READ
STREAM DMA EXT (0x2A). Shouldn't there be some support in kernel which
setups up PRD tables  and all.
It doesn't seem to be possible.... is it?
Does it sound normal if we have something like O_STREAM in open() or a
seperate IOCTL to command the driver to use STREAM commands (if
supported).
Will this feature be useful for streaming media apps like DVRs? (i am
working in one such.)
