Nobody else seems to have any comments on Eric's series
of patches to add a gpio_desc layer ... whereas, I was
looking at updating one platform, and got annoyed at some
stuff that would have been non-issues with them in place!
Eric, would you feel like rolling an all-in-one patch against
the gpiolib support from 2.6.24-rc3-mm?  Including updated
versions of your patches:
 - [PATCH 2/5] define gpio_chip.requested_str
	(renaming it as "label" to match its usage)
 - [PATCH 3/5] use a per GPIO "struct gpio_desc"
	(but without that needless list; for debug,
	just scan the gpio_desc list for the next
	non-null chip)
 - [PATCH] move per GPIO "is_out" to "struct gpio_desc"
	(i.e. patch 4/5)
 - [PATCH 5/5] move per GPIO "requested" to "struct gpio_desc"
	(and "label" too)
along with removing the ARCH_GPIOS_PER_CHIP symbol, and
reducing ARCH_NR_GPIOS to a value which will waste less
space by default?  (Like maybe 256.)
I think an all-in-one patch will be easier to review
and agree on including (or not).
