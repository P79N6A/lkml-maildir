Hi,
On i386, EFI may need to map EFI runtime code area as EXEC enabled with
ioremap(). But, I found that the memory are mapped as EXEC disabled when
mapped with ioremap() now. I think we may need a method to map memory
area as EXEC enabled with ioremap_xxx(). Some possible interface schemes
for mapping as EXEC enabled are as follow:
- Interface scheme 1:
ioremap_cache_exec()
ioremap_uncache_exec()
- Interface scheme 2:
enum ioremap_mode {
	IOR_MODE_UNCACHED,
	IOR_MODE_CACHED,
};
enum ioremap_xmode {
	IOR_XMODE_UNEXEC,
	IOR_XMODE_EXEC,
};
void __iomem *__ioremap(unsigned long phys_addr, unsigned long size,
			enum ioremap_mode mode,
			enum ioremap_xmode xmode);
Which one do you think is better? Or we should use some other interface
or method?
Best Regards,
Huang Ying
