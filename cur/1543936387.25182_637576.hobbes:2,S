Thanks Dave.  I will check the ieee1394 part in detail later.

Maybe add "Drop the reference with put_device() after use." for the

A general comment on the linux/device.h API (not a direct comment on
your patch):
The match argument in bus_find_device(), driver_find_device(),
device_find_child(), class_find_device(), class_find_child() could be
changed to
	bool (*match)(struct device *, void *)).
Then the semantics are IMO a little bit clearer.  Ditto for the
dr_match_t type and the struct bus_type.match member.
I don't know though whether the churn of doing such a change everywhere
would be justified by the result.
A comment on patch 2/7...6/7:
You can bring most or all of the various __match implementations into a
slightly terser but IMO easy to read form, like this:
 static int __match_ne(struct device *dev, void *data)
 {
 	struct unit_directory *ud;
 	struct node_entry *ne = (struct node_entry *)data;
 	ud = container_of(dev, struct unit_directory, unit_dev);
-	if (ud->ne == ne)
-		return 1;
-	return 0;
+	return ud->ne == ne;
 }
Here it is also easy to see that readability would improve if the return
type was bool rather than int.
