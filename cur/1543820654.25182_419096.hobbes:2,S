It isn't, but I hadn't changed the sources, .config or build environment
since I built it, so I did a straight recompile with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO set,
and got:
  (gdb) l *(isolate_lru_pages+74)
  0xffffffff80250c2a is in isolate_lru_pages (list.h:154).
(I had to run gdb on a machine with 64-bit userspace, but I guess just
copying the vmlinux file should suffice.)
