Sorting out disabled events is the filtering you have to do in kernel
and you should do it in the hot path or remove the unneccecary
tracepoints at compiletime.

You are not answering my argument. 8MB/sec is an event frequency of
128hz when we assume 64byte/event. It's one event every 8us. So every
unneccecary computation, every leaving the hotpath for nothing is just
giving you performance loss.

I never said this should not be done.

Seperating layers as I suggested before is not making it a generic
debugging tool. It makes parts of those layers available for other usage
and gives us the chance to reuse the parts for cleaning up already
available code which has the same hardwired structure.
