Did this file individually, per request. Will re-do the whole tree later 
as I'm still working on my handy-dandy testing and patching tools and 
don't have a lot of time outside of work until the summer gets underway.
The patch works in ISO-8859-1 encoding. If I am unsuccessful in getting 
this mail to send as that, or if your viewer reinterprets it from that, 
you'll need to use the file attached as MIME type octet-stream. Thanks for 
your time and interest.
