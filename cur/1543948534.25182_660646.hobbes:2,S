Not sure if it can be counted as an overwhelming need, just actually 
defining the variable-wide character to be use "properly". Saw the way 
through CodeStyle as the correct way to get the "replace 8-space 
alignment to tab" nulled (then fix/change checkpatch.pl).
Actually, I see this as an quite simple question: is tab _the 
indention-marker_? If not, then why the refusal of spaces indents (or mix)?
