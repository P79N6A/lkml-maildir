It's for new linux users? They should use distributions kernels.
It's for "power users"? They just do make menuconfig...
It's for kernel developers? They just do vi .config.
I'll try it later, but I'm a bit sceptical.
How about networking options? It can detect what protocols are needed?
Filesystems?
