One thing that drives me wild about that "clocksource resume" thing is 
that it seems to think that clocksources are somehow different from any 
other system devices..
Why isn't the HPET considered a "device", and has it's own *device* 
"suspend" and "resume"? Why do we seem to think that only "set_mode()" 
etc should wake up clock sources?
It's a *device*, dammit. It should save and resume like one (probably as a 
system device). The "set_mode()" etc stuff is at a completely different 
(higher) conceptual level.
Thomas? It does seem like Maxim has hit the nail on the head (at least 
partly) on the HPET timer resume problems..
