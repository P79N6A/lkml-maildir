I owe you an example. See, for example,
	
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-5.html#ss5.29
Abbreviated version:
  Serge van den Boom reports that his LiteOn MediaTouch Keyboard has 18
  additional keys: Suspend, Coffee, WWW, Calculator, Xfer, Switch window,
  Close, |<<, >|, [], >>|, Record, Rewind, Menu, Eject, Mute, Volume +,
  and Volume -. Of these, the keys |<<, >>|, Volume +, Volume - repeat.
  The others do not, except for the rather special Switch window key.
  Upon press it produces the LAlt-down, LShift-down, Tab-down, Tab-up sequence;
  it repeats Tab-down; and upon release it produces the sequence Tab-up,
  LAlt-up, LShift-up.
(Up events are as usual for the other 17 keys.)
