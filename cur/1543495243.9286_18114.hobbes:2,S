Im getting this error on the 14th track of my Philip Glass CD when using
cdparanoia.  Can anyone give a prelim diagnostic?  Is it like to be a
cdparanoia bug, ide/atapi driver bug, or an error in the cdrom itself?  The
cd isn't scratched or warped, and it plays just fine on a regular cd player.
UPDATE:  Its not a cd error, because I get it on the last track of my Gypsy
Kings CD, and some others.  So its either a cdparanoia error or a kernel
bug.  How could cdparanoia cause this though? I haven't heard of anyone else
getting this error from it.
These error packets just keep on coming and coming and coming until I kill
the process. Im not getting the error with other CD's.

Here is the details of the CDROM drive I have:

Im fairly certain it wasn't the CD that is at fault.  Nor is it cdparanoia
that is at fault: it successfully ripped the same CD earlier.  The only
thing that changed was I upgraded from my ancient 4x speed Goldstar cdrom
drive to a new 40x Retail Plus+ cdrom drive.  Has anyone else had problems
with these drives?  Root access on my server, lambdamoo.to to any kernel
developer who'd like to poke around and see what the problem is.
