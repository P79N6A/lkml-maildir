Hi,
          I am not able to understand how the radeon video card  
driver access EDID info of Monitors attached to the cards.The 
driver is calling one funtion 
get_property(dp, propnames[i], NULL);
But in this funtion its just return some value ie 
dp->property->value; how this property->value field is 
Initialized. Is this get_EDID is called only at boot time. how the value of 
the device _node structure is initilized.
If any have any ideas regarding this please mail me.
