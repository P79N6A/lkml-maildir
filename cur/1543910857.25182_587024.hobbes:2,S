Why do you not want to modify the driver?

You can disconnect the device from the driver from userspace for any
device you just don't want to have connected by using the sysfs
bind/unbind files.  That doesn't require any kernel changes at all.
Why do you want to do this, what are you expecting to achieve with such
a change?
