I'm trying currently Bartlomiej's workaround as I need some image
analysis results on this machine which will take a few days.
From the back of my head:
2.6.13 seemed to run fine
2.6.14.2 which I tried just lately caused freezes which seem similar to
2.6.15rc6 (unfortunately without serial console, so no logs)
I can do further tests in a few days, if the workaround helps, otherwise
sooner.
