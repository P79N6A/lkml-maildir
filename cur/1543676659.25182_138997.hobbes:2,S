Oh, yes, there is most certainly "horrible coding style".  When I was in 
college, I met one CS student after another who really just did not 
belong in CS, and you should have seen the code they wrote.
Imagine a 200 line program which is ALL inside of main().  There is no 
indenting.  Lines of code are broken in random places.  Blank lines are 
inserted randomly.  The variable names chosen are a, b, c, d, e, etc. 
It's impossible to tell which '{' is associated with which '}'.
It's been a while.  I can't remember all of the violations of reason and 
sanity I saw.  I pity the grad students who were faced with grading 
these monstrosities.
