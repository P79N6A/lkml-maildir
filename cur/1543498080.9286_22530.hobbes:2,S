The st driver barfs on OnStream SCSI tape drives...
   st0: Error with sense data: extra data not valid Current error
       st09:00: sense key Illegal Request
   Additional sense indicates Invalid command operation code
Is anyone working on fixing this?  OnStream's web site
(www.onstream.com) has some hints that they're supporting linux
driver development, but no details.
I think OnStream's product is a really great technology, btw.  Speed
and capacity are as good or better than DDS3, AIT, and DLT but the
drives are a fraction of the price of those other technologies.  And
if OnStream's claims are true the reliability should be comparable 
only to DLT.
Now I need to be able to use this puppy to back up my Linux box...
