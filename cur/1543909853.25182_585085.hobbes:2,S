Completely agreed, again. To summarize again (had done so about ~100 mails
earlier in this thread too :-) ...
atomic_{read,set}_volatile() -- guarantees volatility also along with
atomicity (the two _are_ different concepts after all, irrespective of
whether callsites normally want one with the other or not)
atomic_{read,set}_nonvolatile() -- only guarantees atomicity, compiler
free to elid / coalesce / optimize such accesses, can keep the object
in question cached in a local register, leads to smaller text, etc.
As to which one should be the default atomic_read() is a question of
whether majority of callsites (more weightage to important / hot
codepaths, lesser to obscure callsites) want a particular behaviour.
Do we have a consensus here? (hoping against hope, probably :-)
[ This thread has gotten completely out of hand ... for my mail client
  alpine as well, it now seems. Reminds of that 1000+ GPLv3 fest :-) ]
