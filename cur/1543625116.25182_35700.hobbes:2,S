- Apply more patches from Vojtech Pavlik for the handling of host chip setup.
   Hopefully they are settled now.
- Kill unused CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MODES
- Push register addressing down in to task_vlb_sync.
- Make the taskfile parsing stuff actually readable. This is compressing the
   code by an incredible amount. We use just one function doing the whole
   scanning right now. This should make sure that the IRQ handler used by a
   particular command is always right.  I didn't introduce typos hopefully
   here.
- Don't call ide_handler_parser as argument for do_taskfile() any longer. We
   have killed this function by coalescing it's functionality with
   ide_cmd_type_parser() anyway.
- Kill unused SLC90E66 code, which Vojtech apparently missed in his patch.
- sync up with 2.5.7-pre2
Once again the actual patch is rather big mostly due to the removal of
some default configuration variables which are not used anylonger. So time for
the next patch stage.
