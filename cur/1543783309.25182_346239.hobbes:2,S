Runtime modification has possible uses in the form of hot scheduler upgrades 
for systems in production for security upgrades or performance enhancements, 
with virtually nil downtime. This was one of my ultimate aims when pushing 
the original plugsched infrastructure. However both Linus and Ingo did not 
like the plugsched idea at all thinking it would fragment work effort put 
into the mainline scheduler and have lots of less good schedulers instead of 
one scheduler to rule them all.
