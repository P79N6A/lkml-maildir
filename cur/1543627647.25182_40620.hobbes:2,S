This patch adds SMP (and UP) support for voyager which is an (up to 32 way) 
SMP microchannel non-PC architecture.
The patch is in two parts:  The i386 sub-architecture split is 
separated from the addition of the voyager components

(The split diff is pretty huge because it's actually moving files about).  You 
must apply the split diff before applying the voyager one.
These two patches are also available as separate bitkeeper trees:
