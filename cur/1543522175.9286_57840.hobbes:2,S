Most people cannot recompile a kernel, my guess is less than 10% of
linux installations use a kernel other than what the vendor shipped.

Sure -- for now we could have the default as 32767 -- but I see no
reason why a sysctl shouldn't exist for those who want to change it.

If we fix it now -- allow >32k PIDs for those who want it but leave
it to default as is, then within a year or two, most applications
that will break will have been spotted at fixed by people who will
tweak this sysctl to a larger value.
