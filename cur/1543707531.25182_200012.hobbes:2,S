Again, you're not understanding what I'm saying. It's different from
userspace's point of view (it's totally changing the kind of thing sysfs
is presenting, which is why I said I don't believe it should be done)
what I'm saying is that it wouldn't require extra code. It's not making
the kernel do extra work, it's just making it do the same work in a
different way. It was an example to prove a later point, not a
suggestion for how to do things.

I just said I wasn't advocating it! It was just to illustrate a later
point.

Do you see the irony here? You accuse me of just wanting devfs instead
of udev the line after you answer a question with, essentially, "because
then you have devfs, and devfs is bad".
And I already do use the devfs we already have, and have done so for a
long time. But it could use a lot of improvement (the same way udev
could).

Did you miss the word "part"? And you say "no other options", isn't that
what I just said ("only one kernel generated filesystem")?

No, but it was my example of why not everything has to be done in sysfs,
and why having a greater number of more specialised filesystems can be a
good thing.
What I was trying to say is:
1) Isn't it good to have more than one kernel-generated filesystem, if
each one can thereby be more specialised and therefore cleaner? (I
believe you agree on this point).
2) If that's the case, why do you keep arguing that devfs (exporting
device nodes from the kernel in a small and simple filesystem and
letting a userspace daemon control their permissions and make symlinks
so that the "right" cdrom drive is /dev/cdrom and such) is so horrible?

Thought so, but I couldn't remember the name. And it has to do with
devfs (and implementing it using libfs), not with udev per se.

I didn't say I don't know how to code, I said I wasn't a kernel hacker.
And I wasn't TRYING to tell you how to write udev, though I may
accidentally have come off that way.
I started this thread out saying that I liked devfs better than udev for
a few reasons, that udev didn't give me everything I wanted, and that
therefore I would like to know if anyone else felt likewise and if so
whether there was enough interest to "save" devfs, either by fixing the
existing one or by doing it again from scratch.
I wasn't trying to tell you how to do udev (though again, I may have
come off that way accidentally, and if so I'm sorry). The only issue I
ever had with you was that I didn't agree with a lot of your "devfs
versus udev" document. Which is why I started the thread with a sort of
counter to that.

Again, I do. But if everyone stopped working on udev except for
bug-fixes, I bet it would start to be pretty nasty in one or two major
kernel releases. Which is why I was trying to see if anyone else was
interested in saving devfs.

It may be enabled in a lot of kernels, but I don't know any distros that
actually break if you turn it off (though I may be wrong here). So I
don't think you're right when you say "It has so many other benefits
that people can no longer turn it off and expect their systems to work
"nicely"".

I wasn't trying to get somewhere with you. The main purpose of this
thread was to guage the level of interest in keeping devfs alive (which
I suppose I've done, though I'm disappointed more people don't seem to
agree with me on the advantages of a devfs solution over udev).
The most I ever wanted from you personally was for you to make your udev
versus devfs document a little fairer to devfs. I wish you the best of
luck in developing udev, and since it looks like it's the preferred
solution, I genuinely hope it matures quickly so that static /dev on
linux can go away.
