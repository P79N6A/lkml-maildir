  Hi, all. Version 99.6 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
NOTE: the devfs-patch-v99.x patches are maintenance patches for the
2.2.x production kernels. Devfs development is done against recent
development kernels.
This is against 2.2.13. Highlights of this release:
- Ported devfs-patch-v99.5 to kernel 2.2.13
  Thanks to Martin Hoeller <martin.hoeller@xss.co.at>
				Regards,
					Richard....
