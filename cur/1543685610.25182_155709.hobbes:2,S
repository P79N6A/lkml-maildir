There are some mechanics of this that I am not familiar with, so please 
excuse the naive question.
Someone had suggested that a task's sleep time should be determine 
exclusively from the time it spends blocked by what it's waiting on, and 
not based on any OTHER time it sleeps.  That is, the time between the 
I/O request being satisfied and the task actually getting the CPU 
doesn't count.
Is your statement above a reflection of that suggestion?
