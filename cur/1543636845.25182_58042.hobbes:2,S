The paper however ignored something else we do which is why you see
csum_partial_copy_generic. On a modern processor the cost of fetching
and storing memory is so high compared to the throughput of the
processor that it is actually much more effective to fold the copy and
checksum together. Generally the copy/checksum has the same speed as a
pure copy anyway
