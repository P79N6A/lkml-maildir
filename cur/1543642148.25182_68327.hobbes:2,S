Reboot is bad. Retries are bad. 
Errors should be returned to an upper layer, with an error code: "may
retry", or "will never work". (Like in SMTP)
I will most likely set the "retry count" to 0: Never retry. Almost
never works anyway. And the disk already retried manytimes, so
retrying in software is only "taking time".
We do datarecovery around here. We get bad disks on a dayly basis. We
are currently reading a drive that gets over 10Mb per second while
spitting out bad block reports!
Thing is: those blocks that didn't work first time, may work on our
second retry. However, we need userspace control over that retry. We
prefer to get the 18G worth of data off the disk first, and only then
retry the blocks that happened to be bad first time around.
