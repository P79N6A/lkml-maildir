I've just taken up and printed the doc, I'll read it this weekend.

IMHO, every good technology if bad applied or exasperated will give worse
results.
I continue to disagree with You here, but perhaps we're speaking of two
different things.
I' m speaking about a fine applied multiprocessing and You probably of an
exasperation of it.
But I like to disagree with someone about technical issues, I'm always
happy.
If I'w right I'm pleased with myself for my good view of the fact, and if
I'm wrong I'm happy
coz I learn more about ;)
Cheers,
    Davide.
