   Again I'm not familiar enough with the code at this point
   to determine how to get the ESP protocol to be processed
   before the AH protocol in this case
You can enforce the ordering exactly when the xfrm templates
are built, this ensures that any fully resolved xfrm state
created from them have the correct ordering as well.
