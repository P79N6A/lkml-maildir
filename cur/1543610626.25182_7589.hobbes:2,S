2.x.y, where x is even, is not a development kernel. It's a release kernel.
2.x.y, where x is odd is a development kernel
2.x.yprez is a development kernel
I think his point is that recently, 2.x.y where x is even has been of
the same quality as a development kernel. Blatantly nasty bugs are in it
and they really shouldn't be. And so, in order to test things out better
he effectively saying that putting a -rcz tag on it will help as it'll
indicate a release candidate and as such might get more ppl to use it.
Once no obvious issues show up with those, put it as a release.
No real extra work required. You just need to make a decision of 'enough
stuffing about. I wanna make a release soon' and start labelling
acordingly. This doesn't mean -rcz will be release quality. It just
means that it's close to it. It still wont mean it's 100% bug free but
it's an extra chance to catch the bad stuff.
All in all, it's not a bad idea[tm].
