AFAIK there are no such implementation. All REQUIRED things are implemented
in LinuxThreads from glibc ...

There are NO such implementation on linux. Some things are not doable without
kernel modifications AFAIK.

Feel free to add :-)
P.S. This thread does not belond to linux-kernel till there are no working
implementation with complimentary kernel changes: when such implementation
will be created talks about adding of kernel changes to mainstream kernel
can be started... inheritance/ceiling properties should not require kernel
modifications though...
