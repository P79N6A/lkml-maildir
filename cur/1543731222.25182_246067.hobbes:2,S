This has been fought over on the reiserfs-list ad nauseaum, but
it's a valid point.
That's why I tend to rename metas/ into ..metas/ to avoid
name clashes, even if I've never had a directory named metas/
apart from what Reiser4 ships.
It is then debatable if it should be renamed before it's too
late, have it renamable in the kernel configs (and the name
exported via /sys or something) or just leave it be.
