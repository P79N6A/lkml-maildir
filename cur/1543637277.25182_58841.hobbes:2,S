Hello guys!
I was wondering why 2.5.27 all gettys are not started, but after logging
in via network a ls /dev/vc returned
   /dev/vc/0
and nothing more!   
And I am wondering why there is nothing running on /dev/vc/{1-6}!
I don't know the devfs code, so I will not fix it myself, but perhaps
Richard knows the problem and has fixed it while I am writing this.
Sincerly,
Nico Schottelius
