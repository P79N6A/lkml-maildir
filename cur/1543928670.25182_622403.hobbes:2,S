I wonder if that is correct. CodingStyle says:
                Chapter 13: Printing kernel messages
   [...]
   Kernel messages do not have to be terminated with a period.
I personally think that rule could be made a bit stricter as for example
dmesg output currently looks fairly inconsistent with some messages
terminated with a period while most messages are not and have been wondering
if I should file patches to _remove_ periods.
Maybe the rule should be changed to:
   Kernel messages should not be terminated with a period, unless a single
   message contains multiple sentences.
?
Cheers,
FJP
