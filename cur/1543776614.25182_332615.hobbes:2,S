Hi Linus,
	Please grab the master tree from
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git
or straight from master.kernel.org if it hasn't reached the mirrors yet..
There was a patch to the i915 driver to make it compile which I put in
after I rsynced but I thought I put in before I did..
It just adds a semicolon..
Dave.
