I just wanted to note that I got already the wohle fixup until
the stage where the first schedule() occures during the kernel
initialization... printk and so on all seem to work nicely ;-).
Well the where some errors which had to be fixed until this.
For example the decompress_kernel function should have the
attribute asmlinkage and boot/compressed/misc.c should not export
enything else.
Further debugging will occur this evening...
