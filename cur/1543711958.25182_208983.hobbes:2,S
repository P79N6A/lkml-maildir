the problem is: there was no output. really nothing.
we tried it two times but there was nothing on the serial console like 
there is nothing on the main output.
the only additional info that i can give is the behaviour of the 
ssh-service:
1. i am logged in to the server.
2. the crash is indicated with the stop of any output.
3. you cannot connect anymore.
4. if you try a "telnet server 22" you receive the ssh-greeting.
5. after around a minute or so even the telnet to port 22 won't 
establish a connection.
then finally the server is 100% gone.
without any trace of information in the local logfiles or on the screen.
is there some "hardware-way" that we could try?
i am sure that i can bring my superior to some point of investing/ 
lending something to figure out more. it's also possible that we can 
ask compaq about this, but it might not be very successful, because 
they officially support only specific distributions and dist-kernels.
with regards
klaus m. brantl
