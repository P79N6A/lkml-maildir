Yes it should

It's not, I've known this for some time. With some queues doing highmem
I/O though, it becomes less easy to do it. But I'll just change it to
look at the number of low mem pages available. I doubt it would matter
much, the throttling is mainly meant for machines short on memory. For
machines with lots of RAM, the throttling will probably never be
activated anyway.
