Thanks for the data point.
Hmmm... looks as if the likely sequence of events was:
create embedded fdtable
extend fdtable, allocate external data to handle fd = 524
try to extend fdtable again, crash.
Seems as if alloc_fdtable() or copy_fdtable() are to blame, but the code logic 
seems to be identical. Hmmmm.
