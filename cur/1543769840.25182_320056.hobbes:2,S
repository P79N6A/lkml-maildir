request_firmware requires the $FIRMWARE env to be populated with the
firmware image name or the firmware image name needs to be hardcoded
within  the call to request_firmware. Since the user is free to change
the BIOS update image at will, it may not be possible if we use
$FIRMWARE also I am not sure if this env variable might be conflicting
to some other driver.
Thanks
