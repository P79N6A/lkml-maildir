Note the GCC docs:
Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment. This
implies -fno-builtin. [...]
This will break a lot of code, since there are many thing that depend upon GCC
builtin magic AFAICS.
(BTW, seems to be supported by GCC 3.3.0 too, because that manpage is packaged
together with gcc-3.3.rpm (suse 9.x))
