It's really a product of the toolchain, not the architecture. For SH also
we have some toolchains that do this, and others that don't. (Usually
sh-elf insteatd of sh-linux, the -elf toolchains in general are pretty
common for the nommu targets). In general we've just not supported the
symbol prefixing toolchains, but if there's a way we can handle this
cleanly at compile time then it's certainly worth trying to support.
