No, glibc-2.2.5-11.5 will also do large files. Just be sure that you
open() the file with O_LARGEFILE. I usually have this piece of code in
one of my header files to get it done:
#ifndef O_LARGEFILE
#define O_LARGEFILE     0100000
#endif
I always forget about the glibc #define-du-jour to get O_LARGEFILE
defined, this always works.
