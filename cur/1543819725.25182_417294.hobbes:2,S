we have an SMP login server we just recently switched to debian
testing from FreeBSD and it's giving us a little trouble.
it mounts its /home on a seperate machine, which is still running BSD,
over a NIC-to-NIC 1000BASE-T link.
We've found the following bug exists in 2.6.15 and .16: If a directory
under /home is readable but not executable, a call to getdents64() on
it will kill the process with an invalid operand error in
__copy_from_user_ll
has this been fixed already, and is there a patch which is readily applicable?
we're not using the latest kernel, unfortunately, because it has lockd problems.
