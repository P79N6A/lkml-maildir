Generally when I was playing with it I found that if something was critically 
dependant on the _value_ of a tunable rather than the algorithm design, it 
would simply take a different piece of hardware or test case to induce the 
problem, and the algorithm would have to be changed instead of tweaking the 
parameters. This will require a some thought as to the design and an 
algorithm change for the long term rather than tweaking a value :-|
None of this behaviour existed when the interactivity code went in during 2.5 
and I could never have anticipated this pipe design change coming and 
affecting it in this way.
