I'm not horribly attached to the way reiserfs is doing it right now.  If
reiserfs writepage manages to map any blocks, it writes them to disk, even
if mapping other blocks in the page failed.  These are only data blocks, so
there are no special consistency rules.  If we need to change this, it is
not a big deal.
