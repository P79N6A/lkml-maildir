I'm not sure I like the leading __.  In the print_symbol case, I think 
the function
was given a leading __ so that code referencing print_symbol would use the
macro which formulates the call into __print_symbol.  I don't mind 
sprint_symbol
though.  Since Andrew Morton included the patch, I'll defer to his judgment.

You're right.  This should just be a simple "return;".  My bad.  Good catch.
Since Andrew Morton has already included this patch, I'll let him
make this change if he sees fit.
