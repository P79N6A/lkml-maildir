<scratches head> Did you ask this question a couple of weeks ago? ;)
AFAIK IPsec is an IP-only thing.  Therefore no... unless you use some form
of IPX-in-IP encapsulation first, and then send those encapsulated packets
over IPsec.

Well... the CIPE project may do what you want.  The standard (and only
supported?) version does just encapsulated/encrypted IP.  But, there was a
branch some time ago that could encapsulate/encrypt arbitrary Ethernet
frames -- therefore IP, Appletalk, IPX, etc.  I don't know how hard it
would be to rev up those changes -- you may be able to do it, or throw beer
or $$$ at the developers.
