I'm seeing the same thing on a 3114. (And even uber flaky behavior on a
3ware 8506-4LP... rebuilds succeed, OS can pattern fill the array without
error, but a media scan/parity check fails within minutes.)  There's
likely nothing wrong with your drives.  Something about that driver and
the hardware aren't playing nice.
I have 4xST3160023AS's in RAID0 (mirroring what the BIOS does to those drives.
See other posts.)  I can zero the array @ 35MB/s via O_DIRECT writes without
any issues.  I can copy gigs of stuff into the array if the fs is mounted
O_SYNC.  Yet, without O_SYNC, bursts of writes eventually result in a DMA
timeout.  I tried setting SIL_QUIRK_MOD15WRITE for that drive model, but it
makes no difference.
