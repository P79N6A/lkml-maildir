And to answer Joel's statment of these three two already implement their
own ->getattr.  Also it doesn't mean a filesystem has to completely
reimplement it, they just have to override it by reusing generic_fillattr,
e.g.
static int my_getattr(struct vfsmount *mnt, struct dentry *dentry,
		struct kstat *stat)
{
	int error = generic_fillattr(dentry->d_inode, stat);
	if (!error)
		stat->blksize = something_useful;
	return error;
}
