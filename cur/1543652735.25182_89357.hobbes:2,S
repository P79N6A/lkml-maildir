Well, from a debian-user posting I made today about crontab, and then
finding out i misread his statement completely, I'm in danger of
having my license to help revoked.
But I'll google anyways
take a look at the Large-Disk-HOWTO
www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/Large-Disk-11.html#ss11.3
There's a program called setmax, that sets the maximum capacity.  As well,
there appears to be kernel patches, these appear to have been applied to
2.5.3 and above, but maybe not 2.4.x?
According to the howto, drives over 137 are still limited, with a patch to
2.5.3 handling it again.
I'm hoping someone who knows more about the kernel whether this patch has
been applied somewhere along the line.
Is your drive an IBM?
Apparently Maxtor does it right, and IBM doesn't.  IBM , you software clip
the drive to a certain size in another machine, and then move it back to
your original machine.
Maxtor, you can just use the setmax.
Hopefully my rambling helps, and doesn't get my license to help taken away
Mike
