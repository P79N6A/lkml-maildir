Len Brown, a year ago: "The bottom line number to laptop users is battery
lifetime.  Just today somebody complained to me that Windows gets twice the
battery life that Linux does."
And "Maybe I can get Andy Grover over in the moble lab to get some time on
that fancy power measurement setup they have...
"My expectation is if we want to beat the competition, we'll want the
ability to go *under* 100Hz."
But then, power consumption of the display should preponderate, so it's not
clear.
Len, any updates on the relationship between HZ and power consumption?
