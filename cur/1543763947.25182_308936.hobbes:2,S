Ok. I have some doubts about doing the work, and it then being rejected and
i did the work first, which is why i asked. It seemed a reasonable thing to
ask, and my analysis of the problem was sound, so why didn't i get a, yeah, go
ahead, instead of this rejection ?

As i said, some may know things about relationship, or lack thereof, with the
copyright holder, i believe that the people who added those firmware blobs are
all reading this here, and it is from them that i wanted feedback, but it
failed to produce that effect.
/me will investigate bk and how to get the information on who signed those
changes off and commited them :)
