hello,
strange thing, wanted to burn some data ... but i do not see the CD
anymore.... tryed to use the CD in ide-mode.... nothing...
looked in /proc/ide no devices..... so for some obscure reason the
CD-player isn't found.... now i didn't use that thing very much, but it
worked not so long ago.... i checked the cables, all seem ok! the player
shows that it is connected to the system (the led doesn't blink) so on
the electrical part it seems to work....
all the ide stuff is compiled as module, since it is of no use
otherwise, and as i remeber from the CDburning howto that's the best way
anyway....
so any hint is welcome.....
