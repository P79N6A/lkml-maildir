We are in the process of deploying a large RAID 5 array, and people want
to see it stress tested before we put it in production.  I have heard of
some RAID troubles in 2.4 so this is probably a good idea.  If some kind
soul could recommend the best program to do this for 2.4, I would 
appreciate it.
Thanks, 
Britton Kerin
