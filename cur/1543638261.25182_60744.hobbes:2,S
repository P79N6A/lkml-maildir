Can't do that.
Easy reason: there are tons of code sequences that _cannot_ take signals.  
The only way to make a signal go away is to actually deliver it, and there
are documented interfaces that are guaranteed to complete without
delivering a signal. The trivial case is a disk read: real applications
break if you return partial results in order to handle signals in the
middle.
In short, this is not something that can be discussed. It's a cold fact, a
law of UNIX if you will.
There are enough reasons to discourage people from using uninterruptible 
sleep ("this f*cking application won't die when the network goes down") 
that I don't think this is an issue. We need to handle both cases, and 
while we can expand on the two cases we have now, we can't remove them.
