Hmm. The approach I'd take is to always insert the thing into the root 
resource. If we do want to let PnP insert it into some lower-level bus, 
we'd need to have some way to distinguish "bus" from "device", and we 
don't.
So right now, how about just making PnP/ACPI just use
	root = (flags & IORESOURCE_MEM) ? iomem_resource : ioport_resource;
	request_resource(root, newresource);
which is what we do for the e820 map and the other special resources we 
know about (ie the magic resources we make up ourselves like video ram and 
our standard PCI/ISA resource lists like the <0x100 DMA/PIC/FPU IO ports 
etc)
