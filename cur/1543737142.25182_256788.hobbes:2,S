As far as userspace and 2.6. goes the "only true protocol" that you should
use when getting data from /dev/input/mice or /dev/input/mouseX is
ExplorerPS/2. That's because kernel translates events from input devices
into cooked PS/2 protocol and an application can request either bare PS/2,
IMPS/2 or ExplorerPS/2 flavor regardless of what kind of device is behind
/dev/input/mice
Mouseman is not supported as far as userspace goes. If you need more than 5
buttons look for "evdev" patches for X.
