Hello,
	Today after +- 24h of uptime I found some more page allocation
failures ('eth1: Can't allocate skb for Rx'). You'll find more here:
http://tuxland.pl/misc/2.6.21-rc3-mm1-page-allocation-failure.txt
System wasn't doing anything unusual, as usual ;-) X, some p2p 
software, firefox+flash playing music.
Regards,
	Mariusz Kozlowski
