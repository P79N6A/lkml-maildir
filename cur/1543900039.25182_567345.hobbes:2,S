Well at least with -fno-toplevel-reorder it is guaranteed
to work (not the same thing as "is working", heh, but fairly
close).
It seems to me GCC should grow an option to insert .code16gcc
by itself (-m16 perhaps?)  Or GAS could get a flag to include
a file as a prelude before the main thing.  Neither will help
Linux right now of course.
