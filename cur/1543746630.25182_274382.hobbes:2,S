Do you know what I want to do?
Frankly, I actually agree. I'd rather use vt_console_print and gotoxy
directly to do the display of information that doesn't need to clutter
the logs, but when I first submitted code for doing that, people
suggested using /dev/console instead. That makes using these syscalls
necessary.

This was because, following the "use files" methodology above, I have to
be able to find the file I want to use (/proc/splash) even when /proc
isn't mounted yet. I'll happily just call splash_write_proc.

Mmm. Commented on this elsewhere. Perhaps rather than saving and
restoring the values, I should inhibit them being updated? If the BIOS
was doing the suspending/resuming, we wouldn't object to them not being
updated. Does that sound like a better solution? (Remember the aim was
avoid making sendmail etc refuse to work for a while because the load
average is too high).

Used for preparing the image.

It is if they're writing to swap.

Not exactly the same but yes, substantially. I listened then to the
comments and applied changes. I'm listening now. Unfortunately, though,
you just reject things outright without even discussing why they're
there or whether there's a better way I might not have thought of. I
freely admit that I'm not the world's greatest Linux guru; that's part
of why I'm submitting these patches now for review. Could you please try
to be more helpful? I'll promise to be receptive!

Aside from other advantages (quicker development etc), the modular bits
allow you to free about 150k (debugging compiled in) when you're not
suspending. I thought that was well worth the little bit of extra code.

Nigel
