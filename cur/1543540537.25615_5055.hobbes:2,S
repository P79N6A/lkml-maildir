Yep. Sorry about that.

My SAR, the FS50, is especially for DSL modems. I Have no idea how a
physical layer down event would propagate from the PHY side to the
FS50.  I cold poll a PHY register maybe. Hmm. OK. that'd be part of
the PHY driver, right?

Right: We need separate up and downlink speeds, right?

Isn't this just like folding 
	write_phy_8
	write_phy_16
	write_phy_32
	read_phy_8
	read_phy_16
	read_phy_32
	..._phy...
all into one?

Anyway, if we sit down for an hour and think about it really well, I
think we can come up with something workable for the next few years.

If I'd believed in Code freeze, I'd have been stuck since last august.
That's a year now!

This has no advantages besides being gross over the next one.

I've done this. I'm into the "cleanup" stage now, so I'd rather do it
right, once and for all.
