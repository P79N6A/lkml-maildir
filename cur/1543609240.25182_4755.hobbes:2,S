HI,
Has it been noticed that loading binfmt_misc module with 2.4.13|14
kernel the procfs entries
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status
are not created anymore?
so the directory /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc is emtpy, and I do not know how
to manage this module.
Some hints?
Luigi Genoni
