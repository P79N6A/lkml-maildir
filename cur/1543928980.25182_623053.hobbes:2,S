which are those patches? I found only a single relevant patch:
 modules-fold-percpu_modcopy-into-modulec-and-get-rid-of-the-macro-from-hell.patch
anything else i missed?
this patch should have no relevance to the crash i reported. (i use a 
bzImage) It's also a cleanup patch only, it should not affect 
correctness.
