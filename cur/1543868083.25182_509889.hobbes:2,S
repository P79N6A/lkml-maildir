Just double-checking in an effort to actually get the next patch right
(hopefully) -- seems like there are two cases -- if I can read from
the file, I just call readpage and it'll zero out bits.  If the file
is open write-only, things are a little cloudy -- fs/cifs looks like
they just don't do anything.  In the write-only case, do I need to
zero the unwritten portions of the page, or does this get handled
under the covers?  Looks like NFS just avoids this by only writing the
bits that change, which I suppose has other advantages.  I'll refactor
the writepage code to follow the NFS example versus the CIFS code I
originally based my implementation on.
