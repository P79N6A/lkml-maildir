It doesn't help the video to bus, but multiple busses to give a bus per 
card would help, and assuming the data are being saved to disk using a 
decent disk controller which can use the additional bandwidth, at least 
some conflict is avoided or reduced.
This is really a case of using general hardware to the utmost, I suspect 
more m/b bandwidth will be needed somewhere.
