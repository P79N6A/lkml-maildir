The system I do have to test with has a "pop",
but that's from the speakers not the drive.
However, the S.M.A.R.T. data was also shown earlier to provide
a record of the unnecessary wear and tear.
Here it is from two hibernates (Linux "suspend-to-disk") before patching:
-  4 Start_Stop_Count        0x0032   099   099   020    Old_age   Always       -       1711
+  4 Start_Stop_Count        0x0032   099   099   020    Old_age   Always       -       1712
..
- 12 Power_Cycle_Count       0x0032   099   099   020    Old_age   Always       -       1051
+ 12 Power_Cycle_Count       0x0032   099   099   020    Old_age   Always       -       1053
..
-192 Power-Off_Retract_Count 0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age   Always       -       126
-193 Load_Cycle_Count        0x0032   015   015   000    Old_age   Always       -       170404
+192 Power-Off_Retract_Count 0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age   Always       -       128
+193 Load_Cycle_Count        0x0032   015   015   000    Old_age   Always       -       170405
With the patch applied, I don't see *any* new activity in those S.M.A.R.T.
attributes over multiple hibernates (Linux "suspend-to-disk").
Next up, I'll try a few shutdowns and see.
But we should still get Stephen Clark or one of the other reporters
to confirm it on their systems.
