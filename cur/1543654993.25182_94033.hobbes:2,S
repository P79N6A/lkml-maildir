Wouldn't it be much easier to just keep the few system calls that need
to handle such magic system call restart in architecture specific
code ? There aren't that many of them. The arch part does not even
need to contain the full body of the syscall, just a wrapper around
a "do_*" function.
After all this 32bit emulation unification should be something to make
further development easier, not a cause in itself.
