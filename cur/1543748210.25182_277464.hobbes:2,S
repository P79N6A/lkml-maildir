AS doesn't give a lot of bandwidth to the writes, about 10-20% only.
Tiem sliced cfq is more fair, you get closer to 50/50 in that case.

Depends entirely on the work load, I don't think you can say something
like that in generel. For a desktop load, sure.

You should read the new cfq code, there's isn't that much difference
when it comes to the plain act of ordering io or finding the next
request (I stole some code :-).
The data direction batching that AS does I don't see the point of.
