Hello,
Wouldn't it be better if we set the IN and OUT function pointers to the
right functions during driver init. based on the setting of dev->mmio.
And throughout the driver, we just call the IN and OUT functions by
their pointers.  Then we don't have to do if (dev->mmio) every time.
It's similar to the concept of virtual member function in C++.
