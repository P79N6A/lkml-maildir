Subject: PCI driver module unload race?

Hi,
What prevents the following scenario from happening?  It's purely
theoretical - I haven't seen this occuring.
- Load PCI driver.
- PCI driver registers using pci_module_init(), and adds itself to sysfs.
- Hot-plugin a PCI device which uses this driver.  sysfs matches the PCI
  driver, and calls the PCI drivers probe function.
- The probe function calls kmalloc or some other function which sleeps
  (or gets preempted, if CONFIG_PREEMPT is enabled.)
- We switch to another thread, which happens to be rmmod for this PCI
  driver.  We remove the driver since it has a use count of zero.
- We switch back to the PCI driver.  Oops.
I've probably missed something, but I don't think so.  I suspect we need
struct device_driver to include a struct module pointer which sysfs can
take before calling any driver functions.
Comments?
