I tried ﻿slub_max_order=0 and there is no improvement on this UDP-U-4k issue.
Both get_page_from_freelist and __free_pages_ok's cpu time are still very high.
I checked my instrumentation in kernel and found it's caused by large object allocation/free
whose size is more than PAGE_SIZE. Here its order is 1.
The right free callchain is __kfree_skb => skb_release_all => skb_release_data.
So this case isn't the issue that batch of allocation/free might erase partial page
functionality.
'#slaninfo -AD' couldn't show statistics of large object allocation/free. Can we add
such info? That will be more helpful.
In addition, I didn't find such issue wih TCP stream testing.
