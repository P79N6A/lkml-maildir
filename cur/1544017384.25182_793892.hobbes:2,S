Subject: [BUG] 2.6.28-git12: "powerpc/pci: Reserve legacy regions on PCI" broke my G3

The 2.6.29-rc kernels hang during boot on my PowerMac G3 (Beige).
The last messages I see on the console are
Kernel command line: ramdisk_size=8192
irq: Found primary Apple PIC /pci/mac-io for 64 irqs
irq: System has 64 possible interrupts
and then it hangs until I reboot it. Unfortunately I don't have a serial cable
compatible with the G3's serial port so I can't set up a serial console.
Eventually I narrowed the cause down to "powerpc/pci: Reserve legacy regions on PCI"
(commit c1f343028d35ba4e88cd4a3c44e0d8b8a84264ee) in 2.6.28-git12. Reverting that
from 2.6.29-rc2 results in a kernel that boots ok and works reliably.
The problem seems system specific as both my G5 and my G4 had no problems at all
with 2.6.29-rc1.
