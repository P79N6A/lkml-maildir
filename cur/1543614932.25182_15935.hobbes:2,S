I have successfully recorded using the 686B chip, in a PowerPC embedded 
system. I don't have any PC hardware using the chip to compare this 
with. I recall that a great deal of trial and error was required to work 
out which mixer input corresponded to which socket on the board. This 
was using the kernel driver; I've not attempted ALSA.
