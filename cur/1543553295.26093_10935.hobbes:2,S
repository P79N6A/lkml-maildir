Yep, disabling (opposite of "enabling") does allow the kernel to boot just fine.
PIIXn tuning must be tickling something on the system so that the first time we
read from the disk, partition check block 0, the system freezes hard.
I do know that w/o PIIXn tuning the result of the first block read is all zero's
hence the "/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target1/lun0: unknown partition table" message.
Any idea how to go about debugging this kind of lockup?
Guess i'll scrounge up a couple of disks and see if it's controller or disk related.
Weren't you also experiencing this type of problem on a laptop?
