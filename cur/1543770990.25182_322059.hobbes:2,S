Attn: Randy Dunlap,
It means Serial Peripheral Interface. Among other things it is one of 
the modes of talking to MMC & SD cards, some LCD's, D/As etc. There may 
be code in the SD09 SD055 drivers. It is a 3 or 4 wire interface -- clk, 
in, out, and optional extra thing that I don't recall.  I think it runs 
up to about 25Mbits/s.
