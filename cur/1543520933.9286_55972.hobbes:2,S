Hello..
  This was probably discussed a long while back .. but, is the high-memory
configurations in 2.3 (specifically 2.3.34/36..) reliable?  ie, if
configured for up to 4gig, or even up to 64, on an intel box.. will it work
reliably? ( i know i know, nothing is guaranteed reliable yet .. but just
wondering if it would be worth it to start putting a couple more gig into
one of our boxes...)
Thanks in advance,
  Terry
