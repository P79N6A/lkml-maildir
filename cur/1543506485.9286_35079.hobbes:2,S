I vote for it; it would help avoiding a number of bugs.  For example
on the i386 the definition of
#define __io_virt(x)            ((void *)(PAGE_OFFSET | (unsigned long)(x)))
#define __io_phys(x)            ((unsigned long)(x) & ~PAGE_OFFSET)
make wrong constructs which effectivly do things like
__io_virt(__io_virt(addr)) or __io_phys(__io_phys(addr)) work.  They're
obviously wrong.  If above definition's could be changed to something
like:
#define __io_virt(x)            ((void *)(PAGE_OFFSET + (unsigned long)(x)))
#define __io_phys(x)            ((unsigned long)(x) - PAGE_OFFSET)
such broken could at least wouldn't work anymore.  It's also a less
intrusive change than your suggestion as it should only break broken
drivers.  Nevertheless I like your above suggestion - even if it'd be
a pain.
