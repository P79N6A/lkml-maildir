   I *have* had problems with -fno-inline.  I'd very much like
   to be able to turn that on, but the presence of `extern inline'
   functions causes a link failure with `-fno-inline'.
Feel free to submit the patch that converts the remaining extern
inline into static inline.  That is the correct solution.
GCC has every right not to inline and expect the function name to be
referencable externally if you say extern inline, so this is another
reason to fix the remaining extern inline instances.
