Note, -mm contains a patch which lets sbp2 raise ohci1394's use count 
while it is logged in to a target.
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/scjody/ieee1394.git;a=commitdiff;h=d415a9a9685578058800f2677bfeb8090fc212a1
If you run -mm or once this patch is merged, you have to adapt your 
script to either unload sbp2 before ohci1394, or you have to detach sbp2 
via sysfs before attempting to unload ohci1394:
# echo 1 > /sys/bus/ieee1394/drivers/sbp2/${guid}-${ud}/ignore_driver
(for each device)
The corresponding sequence after reloading ohci1394 would be
# echo 0 > /sys/bus/ieee1394/devices/${guid}-${ud}/ignore_driver
(for each device)
# echo 1 > /sys/bus/ieee1394/rescan
(once)
