Oops, my bad.  I got errors doing man on urandom, but neglected to try a man on
random.
The main reason for my comment was the suggestion by Steve Hill that
/dev/urandom was NOT cryptographically secure.  Re-reading it, his comment was
in the context of generating cryptographic keys, so perhaps I misunderstood what
he meant.
