Yes.  I did some googling.
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0209.0/0000.html
and
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0209.0/0898.html
are essential.
It looks LBA-48 was disabled on PDC20265 as a "workaround", because there

Bug was fixed, but "workaround" disabling LBA-48 was never removed.
You can remove these two lines and see if it helps
(but it may corrupt your fs even more if it doesn't).
Because of this bug you are hitting another bug which Andries has described
