Hi All,
They apear as soon as simpleinit starts up. Somtimes I get to a login 
prompt before seeing any. Other times, commands in the simpleinit rc 
script fail.
They do apear to be random. If a command failes, you re-run the command 
and it is OK. Commands seen to fail are basic (depmod, rm cat ..).
The test I did use the same binaries with both the OK and problem kernels 
so it is not a change to the application code, it is definatly a kernel 
issue.
Regards
 	Mark Fortescue.
