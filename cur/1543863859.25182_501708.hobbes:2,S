Hi !
this thread was about maximum number of loopdevices being limited to 256.
actually, there is dm-loop.c under development, a device-mapper target to replace traditional loopdevice. see discussion on dm-devel mailinglist.
it`s still having issues and thus not being an option for now, but maybe worth keeping an eye on if you are in need of having more than 256 loop devices......
regards
roland

First, let's understand the kernel version.  2.4.x or 2.6.y?
I'm only looking at 2.6.y.
Roland, have you tried increasing the max. value of max_loop yet?

The loop_device array is kmalloc-ed at load/init time.
On x86 (32-bit), struct loop_device is 336 bytes, and with kmalloc()
having an upper limit of 128 KB, the max. number of loop_devices that
can be allocated at one time is 128 * 1024 / 336 = 390, not a huge
improvement over 256 loopback devices.
I don't know of any reason that vmalloc() couldn't be used here
instead of kmalloc(), and once that hurdle is cleared (the 128 KB one),
since minor number on 2.6.y is 20 bits, there can be plenty of loopback
devices AFAIK.
I'm sure that Al or probably Andrew could answer this reliably.
