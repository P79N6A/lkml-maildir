AMD recommends a minimum of 400watts for a dual athlon system
IIRC.  Ignoreing that the startup current on an IBM 5400rpm IDE disk seems
to be about 25-30watts.  Each 1800+ MP puts out 66w of heat, meaning it
uses more than 66w (I couldn't find the power useage stats) for a total of
132 watts, so on boot ignoreing everything but the disks and the chips
you've got 12x25w (for the disks) + 2x66w (for the procs) or about
432watts.  This will go down alot after all your disks spin up, but I'm
amazed your system boots.  Morale of this message:  Don't be a dipshit and
put 12 IDE disks on a single power supply.
