fs'es are mounted from block devices, and /dev/hdc
is as much block device as /dev/hdc1.  Just like a
floppy - they don't have partition tables either.
Booting off such a thing will work too, if the bios
don't make assumptions about partitioning.  They
used not to, last time I looked the pc bios simply
executes the first sector of the disk and
the code there have do support partitions itself
if necessary.
I see no need to partition such a beast into
a single big partition - you just loose 
a sector to the partition table.
