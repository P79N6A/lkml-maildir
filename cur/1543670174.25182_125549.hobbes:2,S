The Linux Kernel GCOV patch has a new home.  It will now be available
from the Linux Test Project site at: 
http://ltp.sourceforge.net
.
This release updates the gcov-kernel patches and utilities for 2.5.67
and 2.4.20 kernels, and includes some minor bugfixes.
The Linux Kernel GCOV patch allows utilization of the gcov tool
against a running kernel.  This is different from most other profiling
methods because it can easily tell you things like: which lines of code
are executed, how many times they are executed, and how often different
branches are taken.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
