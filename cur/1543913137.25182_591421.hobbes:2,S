Useless like it'd be a motorcycle w/out a cup-holder :)
Seriously, the ability to get the previous values from "something" could 
have a meaning if this something is a shared global resource (like signals 
for example). In the timerfd case this makes little sense, since you can 
create as many timerfd as you like and you do not need to share a single 
one by changing/restoring the original context.
On top of that, the cup-holder addition would cost in terms of API clarity 
(or in terms of two additional system calls in the other case), and in 
terms of kernel code footprint. Costs that IMO are not balanced by the 
added values.
