AFAICT, mddev_t->major_version is used to indicate the superblock format.  That 
form is used in add_new_disk(), but not in autostart_array().
It looks like the autostart_array function is set up to only work with the 0.90.0 
superblock format, but the add_new_disk function calls the proper 
superblock-handling form using super_types[] to switch between the type 0 and type 
1 superblock formats.
OTOH, I could be wrong.

Oops.  Missed that.

Do we go for Queen's English, American English, or what?  Just so I can set up the 
spell-checker in the proper locale.
