This is mildly ugly, if you ask me. Those are socket functions, and the 
flags parameter contain some pretty specific network meanings.

You'll need an ad-hoc copy function though, since your memcpy-based one is 
gonna explode even before memcpy returns ;) You'll have problems with 
ref-counting too. And that layer is not designed to cleanly support that 
operation.
Unfortunately the "clean" solution would involve changing a whole bunch of 
code, and I don't feel exactly sure it'd be worth it.
