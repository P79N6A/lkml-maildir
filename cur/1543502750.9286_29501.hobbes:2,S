So, in a possible implementation, channel capabilities that support PPP
negotiated
options (such as AFCF compression) are queried by the ppp layer from the
channel
via ioctl, and the results of the LCP negotiation for supported
options are specified by the ppp layer back to the channel by ioctl.

From what you suggest (and I agree), any options negotiated by the PPP
layer
which are defined by an RFC can be handled by the capabilities reporting 
mechanism described above. Any media specific requirements that
do not effect LCP negotiation should be unknown to the PPP layer
(and controlled through a mechanism outside the scope of the PPP layer).
If you place channel specific code in pppd, then you must still
communicate
the channel type to pppd in some method similar to the capabilities
reporting.

I think there is some confusion in describing a generic sync board
interface
vs. a generic PPP interface. The generic sync interface deals with HDLC
frames,
where the user of the sync interface specifies address and control field
(and
any link layer procedures such as LAPB/LAPD/LAPF etc.)
The generic PPP interface should deal with PDUs starting with the
PPP protocol ID field.
There is still room for a layer that implements something like LAPB
with the channel interface on top and the sync interface below. For
simple
unnumbered information frames on synchronous HDLC, a generic sync driver 
could implement the extra ioctls call for PPP capabilities reporting and
option
specification to avoid mid layer overhead.
Just my 2 cents. Whatever is decided, I'm perfectly happy to write to
the new interface.
