I think this is an extremely good idea. I certainly would have no
problem contributing cleanup/fixes to the project under those terms. And
if I did something large and mega cool with ACPI I can still GPL it only
and you can still ignore it 8)
There is a tradition of contributing patches back under the license the
project you are contributing to used (and ACPI is certainly big enough
to be 'a project' not just a patch) 
Suits me fine
