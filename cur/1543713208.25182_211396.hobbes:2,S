Hugh, it will get fixed perfectly, so please give me the time to fix
swap suspend, then I can care about minor issues.
Swap suspend now works, swap resume is still broken and I cannot yet
care about mprotect, after I fixed swapsuspend (and swap resume) I will
be allowed to spend time on non-blocker bugs. I promise mprotect will
merge perfectly your testcase without any problem a few days after swap
suspend and swap resume works.
