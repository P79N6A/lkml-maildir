I think we should go for a much simpler fix: only enable the timer-induced
repeat when the user asks for that (say, by boot parameter).
The keyboard already knows which keys repeat and which don't.
If we forget about the kernel-invented repetition, we solve, I suppose,
the problems of those people who see impossibly fast repeat, and
also your problem.
Your solution, which involves an ioctl, would force changes to user space.
Too inconvenient.

on a 2.4 system use showkey -s and tell me about the combinations
