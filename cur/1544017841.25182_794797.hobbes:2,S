Hmm, moving this call to after populate is not good because

Should I delay to set css_id->css pointer to valid value until the end of
populate() ? (add populage_css_id() call after cgroup_populate_dir()).
I'd like to write add-on patch to the patch [1/4]. (or update it.)
css_id->css == NULL case is handled now, anyway.

yes ;)

Thanks, I'll try some other patch. Maybe it's ok to delay updating css_id->css
pointer.
