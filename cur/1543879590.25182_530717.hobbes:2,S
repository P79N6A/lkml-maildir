	Hello,
I have a MOXA C168H card, and after the upgrade from 2.6.19 to 2.6.21-rc6
(and from moxa.c to mxser_new.c) I get a system lockup after few seconds
of communicating over the MOXA serial line. Noting is printed on the
serial console at all. The system is SMP x86_64 (Fedora 5). I may be
able to do a limited testing on request, but the system is in production
use most of the time. For now, I will probably move back to the older
driver.
	Are you aware of any SMP or 64-bit issues in mxser_new.c?
Thanks,
-Yenya
