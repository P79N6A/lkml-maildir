Subject: [CHECKER] Transcation is not fully aborted upon failure in JFS (jfs 2.4, kernel 2.4.19)

Hi,
We checked JFS filesystem on linux 2.4.19 recently and found 1 case that
looks like bugs.
When doing jfs_rename, if dtDelete fails, the transaction won't be fully
aborted (even if txAbort is called).
The symptoms are either we can read the new entry in the new dir by
getdents, but we can't actually open the file (always get -ENOENTs), or
after we do a sync, we see the new entry which is not supposed to be there
(since the transcation is aborted already).  I couldn't figure out why
this is happening.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
[BUG] Transaction is not fully aborted even if txAbort is called when
dtDelete failed.  dtDelete will return error if kmalloc fails at
'jfs_dtree.c:dtSearch:586 jfs_dtree.c:dtDelete:2066'
