Subject: Re: [RFC] New Improved Cleaner Whiter Timer Interface

Since the ->event interface holds the timerlist_lock across the entire
->event call invocation there is no SMP timer add-back race and the
timer_enter/exit mechanism isn't needed, so more baggage can go.  The
timer_enter/exit is therefore moved off the ->event patch to the legacy
path.  Normal del_timer is all that's needed to delete an ->event style
timer.
The only problem with this is, with the timerlist_lock held all the way
through the ->event execution there is bound to be more contention. 
This is only a temporary problem: run_timer_list is going to be per-cpu
anyway, with a per-cpu spinlock.
The (trivially) updated patch:
