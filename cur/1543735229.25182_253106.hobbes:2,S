Could you provide some details on the type of I/O load?

For another datapoint, did you have any problems with earlier driver
versions (pre b21)?  2.6.8.1 had b14k...

Hmm, could you enable some additional debug settings in the driver:
  in qla_settings.h:
    modify the following line:
	#define DEBUG_QLA2100           0       /* For Debug of qla2x00 */
    to read as:
	#define DEBUG_QLA2100           1       /* For Debug of qla2x00 */
  and in qla_dbg.h
    modify the following line:
	/* #define QL_DEBUG_LEVEL_2  */ /* Output error msgs to COM1 */
    to read as:
	#define QL_DEBUG_LEVEL_2   /* Output error msgs to COM1 */
Rerun your test, then forward over the log.
