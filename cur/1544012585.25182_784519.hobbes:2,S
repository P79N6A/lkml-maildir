i386 has task gates which support unconditional stack switching. But there 
are no 64bit task gates, just ISTs.
BTW I think there are more similar problems in your patch too.

No.  All interesting 32bit CPUs have SYSENTER; the only one who has SYSCALL 
but no SYSENTER is the K6, but it has a weird early variant of SYSCALL with
more problems which was never worth supporting.
