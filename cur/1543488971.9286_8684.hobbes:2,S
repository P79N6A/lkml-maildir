We might be able to just remove the test for blocksize for the old a.out
support. The blocksize only matters for filesystems that support the bmap
operation, so the a.out test is really not strictly correct anyway. A more
correct thing would probably be to do the blocksize check only if we have
a bmap function for the file.
