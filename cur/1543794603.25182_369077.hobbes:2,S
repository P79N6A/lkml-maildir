You've the config option, turn that off on your systems, what's the
problem with that?
Or does this mean I need to ship kernels myself with covert channels
made mathematically impossible with seccomp enabled? I'd rather avoid
having to ship special kernels to run CPUShare as safely as physically
possible. My time is already too short, so I hope I won't have to take
care of this additional burden.
