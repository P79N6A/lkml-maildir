while working in my college thesis, a fortran HPC workload (10k lines
of fortran), converted to C resulted in performance speedups. this was
with gcc 3.4.
A simple f2c conversion + adaptations, resulted in a considerable
speedup. (20% IIRC).
The conversion was not done by performance reasons, the extra
performance was simply a unexpected, but quite nice outcome.
Just to let you guys know, that even with gcc3.4, gcc of C code ran
faster than gfortran of the equiv. fortran code.
... pushing the optimization engine further (-march tunning and -O3)
resulted in bad data.
But I can't swear by the correctness of some of the computations with
REAL's made in the original fortran code.
