Hi,
A somewhat stupid question from me, but I have no documentation about
this topic, namely, how can I enable hyperthreading with 2.6.0 test
kernels?
My /proc/cpuinfo shows:
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 15
model           : 1
model name      : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 1.70GHz
stepping        : 2
cpu MHz         : 1694.605
cache size      : 256 KB
[...]
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov
pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm
bogomips        : 3334.14
I built kernel, with SMP, ACPI, APIC, etc etc etc support, but I don't see
any change. The only description I could find in Documentation/ is "acpi=ht"
about this topic saying that it's enabled enough ACPI just for enabling
HT. But I would like to have full ACPI and HT.
