Surely that defeats the purpose of pcompress? I thought the whole point
was to compress as much of the input as possible into the output?
So 1G into 1G doesn't make sense here.  But 1G into 1M does and you
want to put as much as you can in there.  Otherwise we might as well
delete crypto_comp_pcompress :)
