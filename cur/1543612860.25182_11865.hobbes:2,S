Hi,

Which is still included in the kernel tree and at least Mandrake is
currently using it.
There were no signs of deprecation, so people are legally using it.

Wrong, these are not just warning messages, the driver API has changed.

Except the dynamic update of device nodes won't happen anymore, so it
affects also all leaf nodes in the directories (e.g. partition entries
won't be created/removed anymore). Events won't be created for these
nodes as well, so configurations depending on this are broken as well.

"rare corner case"??? Richard, this isn't funny anymore. :-(
BTW restoring backward compatibility is probably just a couple of lines
code, but first you had to admit that it's broken.
