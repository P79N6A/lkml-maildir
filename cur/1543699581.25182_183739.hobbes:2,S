After thinking about this, and why this would be allowed if disassembly or
reverse engineering Windows drivers is (in some cases) prohibited, I
conclude that the license on the drivers prohibits such reverse
engineering.
Taking that one step farther, could the license on the moduling ABI be
changed, not requiring consent of everyone with code in the kernel just
the designer of the ABI, to prohibit using it for binary-only modules? Did
Rusty redo this when he attacked the module code? Is there a lawyer in the
house?
