nullfs implements a loopback filesystem.
deadfs, as its name implies, implements a "dead" filesystem where all
operations except close() fail.  The reason for its existence is that
in BSD a vnode can be disassociated from the underlying physical
object it refers to.  When this happens, an object from the deadfs
takes the place of the previous "live" fs object.
