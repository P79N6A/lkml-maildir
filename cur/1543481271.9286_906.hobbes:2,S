Folks,
	I am writing this after a junk cleanup session around
	VGER's lists, and I have some steam to vent...
	We, the VGER helper postmasters and listowners, are
	"somewhat" trigger-happy bunch of people.
	If email to you is  1) timing out (48 to 72 hours in queue),
	2) refused for *any* reason by receiving systems, ALL email
	addresses with your domain at VGER are very likely to be killed
	away without further thought.  (Not quite: 'user unknown'
	is treated more selectively, only that recipient is removed.)
	The example below is a case where recipient's machine's
	MX-set contains server(s) which refuse to relay to given
	destination domain.   ('nslookup -q=mx your.domain.')
	Most MTAs with anti-relay-hijack measures use files with
	explicite listing of allowed destination domains.  That
	is a fine method, however you *must* make sure your domain
	is included into that database.
	There are also MTAs which accept relaying thru them if they
	are in the MX set for given destination domain.  I know a few
	such systems which would need around 200 000 entries in the
	explicite database without that facility with associated
	maintance nightmare, however those softwares are rarely in
	your average ISP's use...
