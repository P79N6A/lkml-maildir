And sometimes that ends up being becaue the maintainer is unresposive. 
It happens. I'd much rather make that be the _normal_ flow of events than 
have people think that it's something horrible.

Well, these days there actually _is_. No, it's not per-file, but a 
procmail filter on the patch bots will actually do a lot better than some 
random "notify me on these files", because it can be personalized any 
which way you want..

Yes. I think the -mm tree and Andrew's (and other peoples) patch-
maintenance ends up being another part of the workflow, "outside" the BK
trees, exactly because of that.
