Such ugly transformations are a job for compiler writers and may
occassionally be acceptable in some critical paths. The IO path, which
is literally dozens of function calls deep from read()/write() to
driver methods, does not qualify.
FYI, GCC as of 3.2.3 doesn't yet reduce the if(...) form to branchless code
but the & and && versions come out the same with -O2.
