This is most likely a function of your KVM switch.  I used to use a
Logitech two way KVM which worked fine switching back and forth, except
Linux never saw the mouse wheel, and occassionally I'd lose keyboard
(both in Windows and Linux) which typically required unplugging and
replugging the keyboard.  The Logitech also had the insanely stupid
design of using the ctrl key for switching.  Finally, it adversely
affected my key repeat rate (which drove me crazy).
I now use a Linkskey KVM-K104M ($64.00 at newegg.com) - a four way which
costs less than the 2-way logitech, in which everything works without a
hitch, including the mouse wheel, in both Windows and Linux.  EXCEPT -
in Linux, the wheel doesn't work after I switch away from it and back.
Resetting the X display by switching to a console terminal (ALT-CTRL-Fn)
and back fixes it however.  It also uses a much more sensible key for
switching (double click scroll lock followed by a number (1-4)).  AND -
as a bonus, my key repeat is back up to my desired rate.
I've heard of people having all kinds of problems - the problems are
almost always a function what KVM they're using.
I cannot recommend the Linkskey highly enough.
