Yes, at present.

Yes.  And I think it also implies that the ->populate functions
are wrong to fail beyond EOF, should just set up file ptes there.

rmap 6 nonlinear truncation (which never appeared on LKML, though
sent twice) fixed most of this, and went into 2.6.6-rc1-bk4 last
night: please check it out.
But I just converted madvise_dontneed by rote, adding a NULL arg to
zap_page_range, missing your point that it should respect nonlinearity.
And I made the zap_details structure private to mm/memory.c since I
hadn't noticed anything outside needing it: I'll fix that up later
and post a patch.
I'm haven't and don't intend to change the behaviour of ->populate,
without agreement from others - Ingo? Jamie?
