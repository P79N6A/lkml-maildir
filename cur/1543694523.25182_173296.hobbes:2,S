I am trying to make sound work in my motherboard with CMI9739A chipset.
The driver from c-media works but freezes my SMP (HT) kernel.
So I tried the i810_audio driver in 2.4.22-ac4 kernel. This driver works
but I cannot change the volume. It always outputs at high volume
irrespective what level I set.
I even tried alsa driver snd-intel8x0 and got the same result. no volume
control support.'
I read somewhere that this is a basic deficiency in the codec and that
the driver has to "something special" to achieve this ? Is it true ?
Is someone looking into this ?
If someone can give me some pointers, I can look into this.
thanks,
Saravanan
