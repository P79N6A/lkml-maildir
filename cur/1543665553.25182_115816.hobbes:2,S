I do use it frequently. I frequently boot systems using PXE, but sometimes,
either the bios is buggy, or I don't find how to set it up correctly, so the
better, and most reliable solution is to insert a floppy containing the kernel
which would have been loaded from the PXE server.
In fact, NONE of my systems need nor use an initrd. I find it really useful
to be able to boot from one single file. Having to set up an initrd is really
a pain compared to other trivial solutions. I'd really like Linux not to become
like microsoft products : it's not because one developper doesn't have the need
for something that he must prevent all his users/customers from using it.
I think that there are several people here who think they need ipconfig, and
that should be enough to understand that it's a useful feature, even if you
don't need it yourself.

Willy
