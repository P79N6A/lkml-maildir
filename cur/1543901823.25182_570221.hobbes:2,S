The patch seems fine, but the names are awkward.  They've always been
awkward (it's *userspace* helper, not *usermode* helper), but this just
shines a bright light on them.
So how about:
	call_usermodehelper_setup -> create_userspace_helper
	call_usermodehelper_<SET_EXTRA_STATE> -> userspace_helper_...
	call_usermodehelper_exec -> run_userspace_helper
I can do that as a separate patch if you prefer (but it'd be nice to
have it in the same merge window so the interface only churns once).
Rusty.
