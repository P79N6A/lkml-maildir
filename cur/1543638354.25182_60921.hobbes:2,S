Buddy costs tend to be down in the noise compared with the cost
of the zone->lock.
I did a per-cpu pages patch a while back which, when it takes that
lock, grabs 16 pages or frees 16 pages.  Anton tested it on the
12-way:  
http://samba.org/~anton/linux/2.5.9/
  blue -> purple
The cost of rmqueue() and __free_pages_ok went from 13% of system
time down to 2%.  So that 2% speedup is all that's available by fiddling
with the buddy algorithm (I think).  And I bet most of that is still taking
the lock.
Didn't submit the patch because I think a per-cpu page buffer is a bit of
a dopey cop-out.  I have patches here which make most of the page-intensive
fastpaths in the kernel stop using single pages and start using 16-page batches.
That will make a 16-page allocation request just a natural thing
to do.  But we will need a per-cpu buffer to wring the last drops
out of anonymous pagefaults and generic_file_write(), which do not
lend themselves to gang allocation.
