It's had quite a lot of recent changes in that area -- the "new aops"
patches.
They've been getting quite a bit of testing in -mm and no such problems,
but I doubt anyone was doing much unionfs over jffs2, or even much jffs2
testing with -mm.
The bug smells like jffs2 is actually passing back a "written" length
greater than the length we passed into it.
The following might show what's happening.
