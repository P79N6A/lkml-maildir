After a quick try on RH EL4 gcc 3.4.4-2 it appears that
-fno-reorder-blocks indeed defeats __builtin_expect() as you
say.  (Which is rather bizarre as __builtin_expect() no longer
does what one expects.)  I think that I'm going to strip it out
for my externally compiled modules.  Otherwise, the source code
rearrangements necessary to get the same effect will make the
source code unreadable and generate larger code, which I think
is worse than those effects on the assembler code.
Thanks again.
