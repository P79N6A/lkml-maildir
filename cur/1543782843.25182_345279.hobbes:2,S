Thank you very much: the patch seems indeed to fix the problem. 
However, I didn't boot more than twice with the new kernel now, and in a 
setup with unsystematic behaviour, such a small series of successes may 
mean nothing.
You'll hear from me though in either case after a larger series of 
boots. =:)
