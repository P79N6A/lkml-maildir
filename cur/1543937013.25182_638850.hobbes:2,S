unfortuantely PAT is not the over-riding winner always. It all depends
on the individual attributes. For WB in PAT, mtrr always takes
the precedence.

Yes. The main thing required is on the lines of Jesse's patch.
If the MTRR's def type is not WB, then we need to check if any of the RAM
is not covered by MTRR range registers and trim the RAM accordingly.
