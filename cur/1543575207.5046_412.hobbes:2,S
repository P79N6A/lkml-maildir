Is there a development kernel with DRI for the ati rage 128 mobility m/p
processor?
DRI is available for the rage 128, but it is not working on this chipset.
This seems to be the only way to get hardware acceleration working on
XFree86 4.0, without reverting back to 3
The attempted compile of this was on a debian woody dist, with x4.0
I tried the current kernel 2.4.0-test11
Windows reports the chip as a rage mobility-p agp 1x, agp2x
