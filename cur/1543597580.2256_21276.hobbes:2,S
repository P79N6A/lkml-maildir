Nope. If you got control back due to the timeout, it's done. You

the pointer to the wait-queue it wants to affect.

Penguin : Linux version 2.4.1 on an i686 machine (799.53 BogoMips).
    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
