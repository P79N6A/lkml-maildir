This brings up an intresting point: Why does nobody to more intresting
benchmarks like measuring the throughtput of a nonchanging static-web load
and graph for varrying levels of packet loss?
Or measure data transfered vs traffic on the wire (esp useful for CGI)?
Both of these are much more intresting then OS-A does X requests/sec while
OS-B does Y requests/sec on a crazy hardware config, where X & Y are
well beyond what 99.999998% of the market needs on a single server.
