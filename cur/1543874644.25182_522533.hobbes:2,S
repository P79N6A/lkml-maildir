Doing the same in try_to_wake_up()delivered a counter intuitive result.
I expected sleeping tasks to suffer a bit, because when a task wakes up
on a different cpu, the chance of it being in the same rotation is
practically nil, so it would be issued a new quota when it hit
recalc_task_prio() and begin a new walk down the stairs.  In the case
where it's is told that the awakening task is running in the same
rotation (as is done in pull_task, and with the patchlet below), since
p->array isn't NULLed any more when the task is dequeued, there would be
an array (last it was queued in), there's going to be time_slice (see no
way 0 time_slice can happen, and nothing good would happen in
task_running_tick() if it could), and since per instrumentation nobody
is ever overrunning runqueue quota, it should just continue to march
down the stairs, and receive less bandwidth than the full restart.
What happened is below.
'f' is a progglet which sleeps a bit and burns a bit, duration depending
on argument given. 'sh' is a shell 100% hog.  In this scenario, the
argument was set such that 'f' used right at 50% cpu.  All are started
at the same time, and I froze top when the first 'f' reached 1:00.

I was more than a bit surprised that mainline did this well, considering
that the proggy was one someone posted long time ago to demonstrate
starvation issues with the interactivity estimator.  (source not
available unfortunately, was apparently still on my old PIII box along
with the one Willy posted when I installed opensuse 10.2 on it.  damn.
trivial thing though)
