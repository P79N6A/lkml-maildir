Hello all,
While playing around with the agpgart module I noticed the following strange
behaviour.
The hardware in question is an Asus K7V with the KX133 chipset and has been
tested on both 2.4.0 and 2.2.18 kernels.
The output below is just from insmod,rmmod,insmod agpgart without starting
X.
insmod agpgart for the first time:
Jan 22 23:17:10 deepblue kernel: Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff
Hartmann
Jan 22 23:17:10 deepblue kernel: agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp
memory: 204M
Jan 22 23:17:10 deepblue kernel: agpgart: Detected Via Apollo Pro chipset
Jan 22 23:17:10 deepblue kernel: agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xe4000000
                                                                  ^-------
rmmod, insmod agpgart:

                                                                  ^------
Apparently AGP isnt working afterwards.
Someone know what might be causing this?
If you need more information or a want me to help debug this issue further
dont hestitate to tell me.
