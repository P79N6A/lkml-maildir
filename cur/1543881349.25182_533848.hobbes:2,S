Well, probably I missed something, but why can't we do
	if (!freezer_should_exempt(current)) {
		freezer_exempt(k);
		thaw_process(k);
	}
?
thaw_process(k) is properly serialized with refrigerator(), and it checks
frozen(k). We can make an extra wake_up, but this should not matter.
Rafael, please check the recent changes in kthread.c, kthread_stop() was
reworked, we don't have kthread_stop_info any longer.
Oleg.
