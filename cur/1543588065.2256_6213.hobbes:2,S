There is still no standard support in the 2.4 kernel for your problem
but you can try 
http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/hidden-2.3.41-1.diff
You can see some fails while applying but don't worry. You can try
the same 2.4.2 patch (I should make actual diff one day, for now may be
I'm trying to determine how long can live this patch) from
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-virtual-server&m=98286657511673&w=2
This functionality is same as in Linux 2.2

	With "hidden" you will see that your ARP probes can go through
any device without problem, of course, if the targets listen everywhere.
If an address can't be announced from the outgoing device, it is replaced
with valid source address in the ARP probe. You still can need some
source routing rules if you want the other IP traffic with specific
source address to go through specific interface. In other case (routes
by destination, for example), your ARP probes and the IP traffic will
go through one device only.

	Fine :) Because the "hidden" usage assumes secure environment
in some cases.

        The ARP usage is recommended :)

        You can determine it with:
ip route get DESTINATION_IP
	Only the displayed route will be selected but you don't need
to delete the other.
