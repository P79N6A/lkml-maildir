Not sure what's the story behind ECANCELED not being in kernel headers,
certainly it is something only userland needs ATM.
It is a POSIX mandated errno code used in aio_* that glibc is using
since 1998, so it would be really bad to break all apps using aio.
The values you posted match exactly what glibc is using:
libc/sysdeps/unix/sysv/sysv4/solaris2/bits/errno.h:# define ECANCELED   47      /* Operation canceled.  */
libc/sysdeps/unix/sysv/aix/bits/errno.h:# define ECANCELED      117     /* Asynchronous i/o cancelled.  */
libc/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/alpha/bits/errno.h:#  define ECANCELED     131
libc/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/sparc/bits/errno.h:#  define ECANCELED     127
libc/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/bits/errno.h:#  define ECANCELED   125
libc/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/hppa/bits/errno.h:#  define ECANCELED      ECANCELLED
libc/sysdeps/mach/hurd/bits/errno.h:#define     ECANCELED       _HURD_ERRNO (118)/* Operation canceled */
just maybe asm-parisc/errno.h could have
#define ECANCELED ECANCELLED
added (ECANCELED is the POSIX mandated spelling, while asm-parisc/errno.h
for some reason defines ECANCELLED).
