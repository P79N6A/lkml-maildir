Yup.  Examples:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/agk/patches/2.6/editing/
http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/kernel/rr-latest
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-02-usb
Note how you can publish subsets of your patchset by bracketing them with
"# MM_PATCHES_START" and "# MM_PATCHES_END" for -mm, and "#
NEXT_PATCHES_START" and "# NEXT_PATCHES_END" for linux-next.
