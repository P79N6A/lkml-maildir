It seems so far. There hasn't been any problem since I've applied the fix.

For the record: this HTP374 is running with a quite outdated firmware 
(1.22) - maybe newer firmwares work correctly. I'm going to upgrade the 
firmware to the latest one (which was released in 2004...), but 
unfortunately in the upcoming 2-3 weeks I won't have access to this 
machine, so I can't check the case within the release cycle of 2.6.22. If 
you were interested I would post the result of the firmware upgrade.
Regards,
