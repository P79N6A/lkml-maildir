An added problem is that many of the high speed interfaces have
interrupt mitigation. The chip will hold off the interrupt for a short
time to try and aggregate multiple packets. This has the effect
of synchronizing the interrupt, and reduces the entropy, especially
under load. NAPI also eliminates much of the entropy in network drivers.
So the quality of the entropy also depends on the chipset. Most of
the older, dumber hardware probably has better entropy but worse performance.
