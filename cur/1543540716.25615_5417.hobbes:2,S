Sorry Kevin, I know you took this off the list, but I'm providing a little
more useful information, and I wanted everyone to see it, so I'm moving it
back.
I'm still Chris, just not at work right now.

That is why I started looking for hardware problems, cause yes, that is
what it seemed like to me at first.

Today I did write a scipt that unpacked the kernel tree, copied a .config
file over, and then did a "make oldconfig dep bzImage" and then deleted
the tree and started over.  I let it run for about an hour.  No problems.
I then did a "make bootstrap" of gcc 2.95.2.  No problems.  I then built
"binutils" and "make".  I followed that up with OpenSSL and OpenSSH.  No
problems.

So feeling lucky, I went back to "glibc" one more time.  BOOM!  Missing
file, try agian, missing file, try again, segfault, try again, oops.
And as I said in another post.  One bonnie++ runs fine (and fast).  But
when I tried four concurrent bonnie++s.  Oops.
(I have boxed PIIIs, so I can't easily remove the heat sinks.  They seem
to run really cool anyway.)

Thanks, I need it.
