Subject: Linux still vulnerable to DoS attacks through ppp link

About a few minutes ago whilst I was on IRC, some braindead script kiddie
managed to $$$$ up my ppp connect such that I was left hanging online, no
data coming in, no data coming out through the ppp link. Repeated pings to
other sites did not return anything. I had to do a ppp-off and ppp-on to
restore the link. 
Is there any methods or ways I can set a watch and log whatever is
happening so I can post a more detailed report to get it fixed? 
What's annoying is that I have nothing in the logs to indicate what
happened. 
Cheers,
Alex
