Sounds good.

IMHO not required:
config SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
	bool "Software Suspend (Hibernation)"
	depends on PM && SWAP
	depends on SUSPEND_UP_POSSIBLE || SUSPEND_SMP_POSSIBLE

This would give you "trying to assign nonexistent symbol SUSPEND_POSSIBLE"
kconfig warnings on architectures without SUSPEND_POSSIBLE.
(And you missed the UP case in your example.)

<--  snip  -->
An implementation detail of the suspend code that is not intuitive for 
the user is the HOTPLUG_CPU dependency of SOFTWARE_SUSPEND if SMP.
This patch handles the dependency of SOFTWARE_SUSPEND on HOTPLUG_CPU 
automatically without the user requiring to know about it.
Thanks to Stefan Richter and Linus Torvalds for valuable feedback.
