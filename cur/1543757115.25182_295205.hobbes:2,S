More prior art - a company called FDR made a disk compactor product for IBM's
OS series, and I seem to remember a SHARE (IBM mainframe user group) tape that
had a program to read the I/O trace table and generate an optimal "what goes
where" command stream for FDR's software.  Again a late 70s to early 80s thing.
(Probably not enough to be "prior art" by itself, but certainly goes towards
the "obviousness to a practitioner in the field" criteria - if *I* knew about it
as a junior sysadmin at a college in middle-of-nowhere upstate NY knew about
it in 1983.. ;)
