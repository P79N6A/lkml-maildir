Ick, why?  Shouldn't something like this be done in the driver core, and
not in the individual drivers?

Looks like one of the kobjects that you are wanting to link is not fully
initialized and registered with sysfs.  Where are you getting that
"&class->kobj" from?
Have a pointer to your patch anywhere?
Also, try turning on kobject and driver core debugging, you should get a
lot of helpful information in your syslog right before this oops.
