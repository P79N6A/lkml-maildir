We could make inet_init() a subsystem init but I vaguely recall
that we were doing that at one point and it broke things for
some reason.
Perhaps fs_initcall() would work better.  Or if that causes
problems we could create a net_initcall() that sits between
fs_initcall() and device_initcall().
Or any other ideas?
