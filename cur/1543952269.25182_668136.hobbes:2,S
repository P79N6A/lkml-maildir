According to you.  A more accurate statement: if you have the ramdisk
on the host, then the host is assumed to be reliable.  If the ramdisk
is external (

)
then your statement is untrue in every sense.
But you did not address the logic of my statement above: that your
fundamental design prevents you from operating at ramdisk speed during
normal operation.

No wait, it is completely normal.  There is a barrier on every journal
transaction.  Constructing such a load is trivial.

It is completely normal for a transaction processing system.

Exactly the purpose for which this driver was written.  And as a bonus
it happens to be useful for internal ramdisk applications as well.  (It
is useful for me, however your mileage may vary.)

Device mapper already can, so I do not get your point.  Also, what is
this layering violation you refer to?

Hostility does not equate to accuracy.  Galileo comes to mind.
I see people arguing that a server+linux+batteries+mirroring+replication
cannot achieve enterprise grade reliability.  Balderdash.
