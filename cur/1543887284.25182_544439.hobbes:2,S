One "problem" with lxr.linux.no is that it's only updated from time to
time.  Maximilian Wilhelm and I added some preliminary GIT support to
LXR, and we're working on a patch to present the list of versions as
drop-down boxes (instead of a long link list.)
This should allow to index all and any tagged versions of the Linux
kernel and present them.  However, I don't have a box that's equipped
properly (HDD, CPU as well as network connectivity) to offer such a
setup, but I'd help in setting it up if somebody provides the machine!

You can easily get this information from 
http://git.kernel.org/git
 .

I'd support the idea, but somebody needs to offer a machine or two and
enough bandwidth. (Though I hope that it's used rarely enough so that
only one machine is needed.)

There's *no* way to add this to the current kernel.org machines.
There's quite some DB access during indexing, and making up the
sources on request takes some CPU cycles, too.

As I said: If you manage to prepare the box, I'll offer to do the LXR
setup and automate the indexing.
