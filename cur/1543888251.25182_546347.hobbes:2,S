There's no further processing needed in the kernel. The userspace
application would receive these input events and act accordingly, like:
read data from the soundcard and send it to the VoIP server, or only
certain channels based on which buttons are currently pressed etc.

I already thought about this option (to whitelist this particular
vendor/device ID as an hid-input device), but I first wanted some
feedback on the whole situation. As for the patch, I have zero knowledge
of the hid subsystem.. but if you give me a go on this, I'll try to dig
into the code and make a patch :)

This pad has no other purposes than just having eight buttons. Mapping
these buttons into input events is all that is needed to make a useful
userspace application for it.
Considering how many users actually have this device and try to get it
working under Linux (probably only me), I wouldn't be mad if you
rejected a patch. I don't even know if I will ever write an userspace
application for it! But, I have this device lying around on my table and
in my old Windows days it was quite useful, so I'd like to share my
findings with others.
