Sam,
beyond the problem reported in http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113751198318080&w=2, I see another
problem: There now is a .kernelrelease file getting generated in the source tree, making it impossible to build from a
read-only one. Thus I don't think the patch suggested there is correct. Instead, arrangements must be made for the make
to happen in the output tree instead. I didn't have time to come up with a patch for this, yet.
