Yes, I saw that.  This basically means it has to be a hardware bug,

This was the first thing that occurred to me, but I am not really a
video driver expert, and looking at the code it's just banging bits.  I
have hacked device drivers, just not video, and I don't have the
bandwidth to learn right now.

Yes, I would be happy to just get an acknowledgement of the issue. 
Actually I don't even need that, I just want to know if it's fixed in
the newer ones.  I have a perfectly acceptable workaround.  The 2D
acceleration is pretty shoddy anyway, many things seem to work better
with NoAccel.   I still love the EPIA board.
Maybe you could forward this on to them?  Off the record is fine.
