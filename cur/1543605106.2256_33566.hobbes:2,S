Subject: [PATCH] kernel 2.4.12: drivers/parport/ieee1284_ops.c undefined symbol

When compiling the latest kernel (2.4.12), gcc failed, in
drivers/parport/ieee1284_ops.c with two errors about an undefined
symbol, IEEE1284_PH_DIR_UNKNOWN.
I looked at the source, and found that the symbol apparently (as far as
I can tell, anyway) should have been IEEE1284_PH_ECP_DIR_UNKNOWN.
I made the changes, recompiled, set my parallel port to ECP in the BIOS,
and was able to successfully print using lpr, so I am fairly sure it
works well.  However, I haven't been able to try any demanding
ECP-specific tests (like, for example, custom hardware using the ECP
protocol, with both forward and reverse channels).  I have no such
hardware.
Let me know if the change makes sense or not.  Thanks.
Oh, and I am using gcc 2.95.3, make 3.79.1, and binutils 2.11.90.0.8, if
that matters (I think not, given the nature of the error).
Sorry if this has been addressed already, but I didn't see it in a
search of the archive (through Oct 15) on
uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/index.html[unhandled content-type:application/x-tar]
