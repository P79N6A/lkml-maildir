The prefix will come from the module name, not the source name, even
when the code is built into the kernel.  So in the case of bttv it will
be bttv.foo, not bttv-cards.foo.  That needs information from the
Makefile which is currently discarded, the Makefile processing for
multi object modules needs to be changed, which is why it is a 2.5
change.
