That is probably the most efficient approach. If its PCI you dont need to
pull DMA pages. You can also grab a chunk of pages if your board can do
scatter gather pulls from them. 
Using mmap() means you can map the same memory into the address space of
the user app and the kernel. That is probably as good as you get for small
stuff.

With 2.3.x you can use kiovecs and the routines with them to lock down user
pages and get a list of addresses. So you can 
	foo_write
	get kiovec
	lock pages
	translate addresses and send message to media processor
	returning irq
	unlock pages
	return done
