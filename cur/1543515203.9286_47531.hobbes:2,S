Subject: [BUG REPORT]: lock-up when doing networking stuff

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
solid hang when editing a couple of scripts, after browsing the net 
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
my pc locked up solid a couple of minutes ago. mouse stopped working, the
keyboard didn't work any more, no network access.
SysRQ also didn't work - the last time I had a lock up, this worked...
I suspect that this problem comes from the isdn modules. The hangs always
occured slightly before a connection was established or slightly after it
was dropped. Also (not related to this, I think), once I forgot compiling
in DSS1, ie. there was no protocol selected, and immediately after a
connection was established the pc froze. However, as I just said, that
seems to be a different problem.
Anyway, 
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
networking, isdn, 3dfx framebuffer (??)
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.3.24 (root@mahatma) (gcc version 2.95.2 19991024
(release)) #5 Tue Nov 2 17:14:25 MET 1999
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
n/a, unfortunately
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
I haven't found a way to trigger the lock up yet.

this kinda makes me think, that isdn is the cause. (those lpd messages are
all over the place - I was too lazy to delete the entry from the remote
queue - so they are irrelevant)
I tried to use SysRQ-p,t and m but those didn't work.
When this lock-up happened, the following programs were running:
X, Netscape, xmms, bladeenc (mp3-encoder), 2x vi, apache, sendmail, mysql,
pine, slapd, gpm...those are the ones I remember.
I was working at the console on a php4-script and a couple of templates.
=============
If there's anything else you need, I'll mail it. I'll do whatever you want
me to do. 
I would be happy to track that bug down (if you can tell me how to :),
since it already bit me thrice.
Reg.,
