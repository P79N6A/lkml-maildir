The only thing I can find on the linux-scsi list is refering to sg
devices, which are on a different device node from the non-generic
device.  This means you can still allow users read access to the disk
without allowing them to send random commands to the disk -- this isn't
currently possible with the IDE interface, since the device with
generic access is the same as the one with the original read/cdrom
commands access.
As it is, it's impossible grant users read-only access to an IDE cd-rom
without allowing them to do things like replacing the firmware with a
malicious/non-working one.
Generic access allowing such things is fine; but only if we can grant
non-generic access without granting generic access.

Thanks, I didn't know about this one -- works great :)
