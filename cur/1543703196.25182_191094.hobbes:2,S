Hello!
I got a small server, which main purpose is routing and dialup besides being
a repository for files. This system is very noisy. Because of that I want to
stop the disks from spinning, when the system is in regular usage (standby,
routing..). This should happen through a read and write cache which keeps
the most often used files in RAM (like log files, bash, ...), so that there
is no need for the system to access the (physical) hard drive.
I would like to use a regular filesystem with a sort of transparent cache.
Any ideas?
Ciao,
Jürgen
