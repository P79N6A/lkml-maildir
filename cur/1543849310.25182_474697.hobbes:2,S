Probably too big.  It's also the ugliest.  I'll split it and resend (not 
through thunderbird though... ate all my tabs!).

Working code is fairly hairy, since it's emulating a PC.  That'll be on 
sourceforge once they approve my new project.
In general one does
  open("/dev/kvm")
  ioctl(KVM_SET_MEMORY_REGION) for main memory
  ioctl(KVM_SET_MEMORY_REGION) for the framebuffer
  ioctl(KVM_CREATE_VCPU) for the obvious reason
  if (debugger)
    ioctl(KVM_DEBUG_GUEST) to singlestep or breakpoint the guest
  while (1) {
     ioctl(KVM_RUN)
     switch (exit reason) {
         handle mmio, I/O etc. might call
            ioctl(KVM_INTERRUPT) to queue an external interrupt
            ioctl(KVM_{GET,SET}_{REGS,SREGS}) to query/modify registers
            ioctl(KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG) to see which guest memory pages 
have changed
     }
I have some simple test code, I'll clean it up and post it.

- architectural simplicity: instead of splitting memory management and 
scheduling between Xen and domain 0, use just the Linux memory 
management and scheduler
- use standard tools (top(1), kill(1)) and security model (permissions 
on /dev/kvm)
- much smaller codebase (although paravirtualization is not included (yet))
- no changes to core code
- easy to upgrade an existing system
- easier for drive-by virtualization (modprobe kvm; do-your-stuff; 
ctrl-C; rmmod kvm)
- longer term, better performance since there's no need to switch to 
domain 0 for I/O (instead just switch to user mode of the VM's process)

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
