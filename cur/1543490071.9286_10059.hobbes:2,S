Yep, done that. :)
I have patches for 2.0.34/35 and 2.1.125 already working, outputing
both per-partition and per-spindle access stats via /proc/partitions.
A "sard" front-end gives human-readable output.  (It is modeled on the
output of the SVR4 "sar -d" output.)
Currently you get average %utilisation; average request queue length;
number of K transfered plus number of distinct IOs for reads, writes
and combined; and average request service time for each disk and each
partition. 
Look for
	
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org
:/pub/linux/sct/fs/sard-0.2.tar.gz
for the patches and sard source code.  The plan is to integrate this
into 2.3 once we have got a more sensible kdev_t in the kernel.
