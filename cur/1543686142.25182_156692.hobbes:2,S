Unrelated to the corruption issues:
Is this how cryptoloop works?  The sector number is used directly as the
IV (not the encrypted sector number)?  In other words, if X denotes the
first block of plaintext and S the sector number, then the first block
of ciphertext is C = E_K(X ^ S)?
If yes, I noticed a small security weakness.  This usage of CBC mode can
leak a few bits of information about the plaintext data, in some cases.
For instance, consider the following example.  Let X denote the first block
of plaintext at sector S, and X' the first block of plaintext at sector S'.
Suppose X' = X^1 and S' = S^1 (here "^" denotes xor, as usual).  Then
C = E_K(X^S), and C' = E_K(X'^S') = E_K((X^1)^(S^1)) = E_K(X^S) = C.
This condition can be recognized in the encrypted data.
In other words, here's the attack.  The attacker looks at two sectors,
number S and S', and looks at the first block of ciphertext in each sector,
call them C and C'.  If C = C', then the attacker knows that
X = X' ^ S ^ S', where X and X' denote the first block of plaintext in
each sector.  If plaintext were totally random, this would almost never
happen (with probability 2^-64 for a 64-bit block cipher).  However,
plaintext data often isn't exactly random.  There are some plausible
ways that the condition X = X' ^ S ^ S' could arise with non-negligible
probability, and if this happens, information leaks to the attacker.
Is this a problem worth fixing?  You'll have to decide.  Fortunately,
there is a simple fix: use the encrypted sector number as IV, not the
plaintext sector number.  In other words, the IV would be E_K(S), and
thus the first block of ciphertext would be C = E_K(X ^ E_K(S)).  This
fix makes the above attack go away.
