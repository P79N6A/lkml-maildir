I have compiled and installed kernel 2.3.47 on my Debian frozen (potato)
box.
It works successfully. I need to use files in excess of 2GB, which
should be supported as far as I can glean.
I used try-lfs.c from 
ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/linux/LFS/
 to test this: it
generates a file that is, as far as I can tell, about 13GB in size. (it
reports:
 llseek(fd,off,SEEK_SET) off=17280532480; errno=Invalid argument
when it ends.)
This is great, but an ls reports that it is 67MB in size:
 -rw-r--r--    1 self     self     67108868 Feb 26 19:44 lfs-test.dat
(ps, matti aarnio, if you could mention in your README that the LFS
patches have been merged with the tree, that would be great.)
I have Libc6 2.1.13. All my compilation tools meet or exceed version
requirements, although I downgraded gcc to 2.7.2.3.  
Is there anything I can or need to do (no matter how experimental) to
get large files working?
thanks,
ethan fremen
