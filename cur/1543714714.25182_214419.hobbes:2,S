Hello all,
I've uploaded some new code to:
ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/patches/reiserfs/2.6.5-mm6
Only reiserfs-group-alloc-9 has changed.
preallocation now enforces minimum allocations too, which cuts down on
fragmentation when applications send small writes.
The mount options are slightly different.  mount -o packing_groups
changed to mount -o alloc=packing_groups.  This makes the new options
more consistent and easier to control via remount and such.
More importantly, the default has changed too.  Once you apply
reiserfs-group-alloc-9, the default is:
mount -o alloc=skip_busy:dirid_groups:packing_groups
If you want the old default:
mount -o alloc=skip_busy
Both reiserfs-group-alloc-9 and reiserfs-search-reada-5 should be stable
now, at least I haven't been able to trigger problems with them in -suse
or -mm.
