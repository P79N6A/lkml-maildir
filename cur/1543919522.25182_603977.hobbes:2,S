Each time I sit down to follow what's going on with writepage and
unionfs and msync, I get distracted: I really haven't researched
this properly.
But I keep suspecting that the answer might be the patch below (which
rather follows what drivers/block/rd.c is doing).  I'm especially
worried that, rather than just AOP_WRITEPAGE_ACTIVATE being returned
to userspace, bad enough in itself, you might be liable to hit that
BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)).  shmem_writepage does not expect to be
called by anyone outside mm/vmscan.c, but unionfs can now get to it?
Please let us know if this patch does fix it:
then I'll try harder to work out what goes on.
Thanks,
Hugh
