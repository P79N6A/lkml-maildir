Nice, but... Too many GNU-isms.  GNU make is not half as good as many people
believe, so you won't gain overly much by using it's specialities.
Better to stick to the POSIX behaviour since this is not to change in between
versions of make and allows people to use alternatives like pmake (which is
better suited to distributed build environments btw.!)
Yours,

PS. I am well aware that the current kernel makefiles rely on GNUisms, but
    there is work being done (by myself and others) to present patches that
    allow the use of _ANY_ POSIX-compatible make utility being used.
