A very wild guess: AFAIK SUSE Distributions are XENified recently, that is they 
have libraries that treat thread local storage differently from the default. If 
these programs (powersaved, slapd, hscan) are all multithreaded, could it be that 
the cause of the problem is in that area?
If not, any clues on debugging/tracing? There's a 
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/oops-tracing.txt, but no "segfault-tracing".
I also learned that the error code is only documented for i386 arch (thanks to 
Emacs ediff):
 * error_code:
 *      bit 0 == 0 means no page found, 1 means protection fault
 *      bit 1 == 0 means read, 1 means write
 *      bit 2 == 0 means kernel, 1 means user-mode
So the problem (error 4) looks a bit like a read on a NULL-pointer dereference, 
right? And the "rip" is user space, correct?
