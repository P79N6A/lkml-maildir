AFAIK there's no such translation at the glibc level - i.e. you'll get
per-thread semantics. (glibc really needs kernel help to do the
per-process things cleanly.) Anyway, this hasnt been a big issue in the
past, and especially for the current testing purpose this behavior is
what we need right now.
