The two problems I have experienced (which may already be fixed):
1) nbd hangs with cfq on RHEL 5 (2.6.18) -- this may well have been fixed
There's a similar debian bug that has been filed as well:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=447638
2) nbd performs about 10% better (the last time I tested) with deadline 
vs. cfq (the overhead of cfq doesn't provide much advantage to nbd [not 
being a real disk], and you end up going through the I/O scheduler on 
the nbd server anyway, so it makes sense that deadline is better with nbd)
There have been posts to nbd-general mailing list about problems with 
cfq and nbd also.
