Hi,
here is a problem:
http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Known_issues#Seagate_harddrive_performance_anomaly_with_hdparm
and my disk is affected by this one as well.
it's ST9320421AS and you can add it to the list
And 2 questions:
1) cause the title contains "with hdparm"...does it mean that
physically the performance is OK and only hdparm shows something
wrong?
2) there is an information about upgrading firmware. as far as i know
Seagate doesn't publish firmwares. So the only way is to contact
seagate support, send the hdd and wait for the new one?
bart.
