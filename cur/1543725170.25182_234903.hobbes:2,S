That's the wrong way around. The zilog ports are always
there, and thus could have stable numbers. The PCMCIA
ports can not have stable numbers; they might be gone even.
In general, the platform-specific (motherboard, generally)
ports should get to grab device numbers first. Anthing
connected by a normally hot-plug bus goes last. Plain PCI
is in the middle, because PCI cards are occasionally moved.
For a PC, serial ports hanging off the motherboard's LPC bus
(what amounts to built-in ISA) should go before serial ports
that might be on normal PCI cards, which in turn go before
those on PCMCIA.
