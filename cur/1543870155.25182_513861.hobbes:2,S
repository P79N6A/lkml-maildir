Yes, but was done by two separate commits, diffstat -M for 
3d5af52d0997d545995d8747c8057be5dee49b14 shows hid-core.c as a 100% 
rename, but later commit b41ea57c01a1943ab36af0017cfc1329815af9ce splits 
it, so in cummulative diffstat it doesn't show it as a rename.

You're right that usbhid.h is not a best place for it. The thing is that 
hid_blacklist[] and related things just badly needs cleanup - it has been 
for quite a long time placed on a really random place in the middle of a 
.c file. In addition to that, the corresponding #defines are scatthered 
around, interleaved with functions (see for example where 
USB_VENDOR_ID_PANJIT and USB_VENDOR_ID_TURBOX defines are).

This IMHO just needs cleanup. Will you accept creating a separate header 
file solely for purposes of this blacklist and related defines?
Otherwise I will just drop this cleanup, but I still think that the 
current situation is horrible.

Are you also opposed to just the code movement? There are some bugfixes I 
think that really need merging, so just to know what would be acceptable 
for you at the time being.
