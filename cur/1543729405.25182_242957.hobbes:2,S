Are you connecting from 2.6 to 2.2 or 2.4 ??
Is a well cooled CPU ?
Those  problems arise a lot when using combinations of 2.6 and any lower 
version kernel.
For some reason 2.6 heats more my cpu than 2.4, or at least it appers like 
that because on 2.4 it doesnt crash as much as with 2.6 when the room 
temperature is hot and the case is closed.
I keep my case opened to dust, but that way I never have a crash con 2.6.
