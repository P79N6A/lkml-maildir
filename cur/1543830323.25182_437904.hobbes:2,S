What is the status of util-linux?
There doesn't seem to be anything significant
released in about 1.5 years now.
I'm worried about patches getting lost,
especially since there were a large number
of thirdparty bugs/patches referenced in
the changelog for 2004.
Personally I submitted a patch in 2004 that was
merged immediately, then I sent a simple bug fix
early in 2005 that has never been released.
Can we have a mailing list (on vger?) to
at least archive patches and bugs?
This is the timeline over the last while as I see it:
23 Sep 2005 ----------------------------------------2.12r
  cfdisk: fix a segfault with ReiserFS partitions
  umount: disallow -r option for non-root users
20 Jan 2005 ----------------------------------------2.12q
  updated translations
01 Jan 2005 ----------------------------------------Maintainership change
23 Dec 2004 ----------------------------------------2.12p
                           :
                           : many changes in 16 versions
                           :
05 Mar 2004 ----------------------------------------2.12a
