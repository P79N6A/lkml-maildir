I agree. Mostly. It might actually be a fairly critical path for some 
things, though. GP's happen with high frequency in emulation environments, 
ie I'd expect both vmware and dosemu to have just _tons_ of them.
Of course, in those emulation environments you usually have other things 
going on too (ie signal handling costs will likely dwarf everything else). 
So who knows..
