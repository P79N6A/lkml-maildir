Because, regardless of the situation, it's both common courtesy and wise 
practice to CC relevant driver maintainers, when you touch a driver.
And it's just common sense:  Greg simply does not know the intimate 
details of every PCI driver.  Nor do I.  Nor you.
In the case of lpfc here, we have an active driver maintainer, and an 
up-to-date MAINTAINERS entry.  Even if you are too slack to read 
MAINTAINERS, 'git log' would have given you the same info.
Don't pretend there is some benefit here to ignoring the people that 
best know the driver.  I don't buy that; it simply makes no engineering 
sense whatsoever.
