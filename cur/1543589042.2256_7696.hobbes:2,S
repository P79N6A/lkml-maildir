Does the patch I sent to linux-mm@kvack.org last night help in
this ?
I found that the way refill_inactive_scan() and swap_out() are being
called from the main loop in refill_inactive() aren't equal and have
fixed that in a way which (IMHO) also beautifies the code a bit.
(and makes sure background aging doesn't get out of hand with a few
simple checks)

Rik
