There are cases where doing it in user mode can provide information
that isn't available to the low level drivers.  For example, PCMCIA
will refuse an eject request on a network device that has open
connections or mounted NFS filesystems, but the low-level driver
doesn't have access to this information.  But I agree with you that
the low level drivers should do as much checking as they can.

Why not have the soft_eject hook just do the checking, but no actual
cleanup?  If everything checks out, then the hard eject call executes
cleanly, and that avoids the issue of leaving things in a half-baked
state.  In your case, the return value from soft_eject doesn't give as
much useful information: a failure means that some things may have
been shut down, or not.
