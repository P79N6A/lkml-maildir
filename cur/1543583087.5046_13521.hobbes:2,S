So I have a clue - pci-ide.c is looking at a PCI register to determine if
ide channels are enabled.  It seems that the BIOS on this board is not
enabling the second channel of the promise controller in this register.
There are other "enabled" bits, apparently.  pdc202xx.c checks some IO
registers from one of the base addresses to determine status.
Unfortunately, the enabled bit of this register seems to be
write-protected.  There must be an unlock bit in another register.  Anyone
have a datasheet for a pdc202x?  How do I unprotect PCI reg 0x50 
If I bypass the test for the enabled bit in ide-pci.c, I get all my drives
properly.
