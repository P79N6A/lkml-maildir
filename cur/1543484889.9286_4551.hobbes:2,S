Except that the program didn't do a listen(). The program is trying to
make a connection to the localhost's printer port, all it does is
(1) s = socket(...)
(2) bind(s, addr=0.0.0.0, port=515)
(3) connect(s, addr=127.0.0.1, port=515)
OK, normally you wouldn't need (2), but sometimes print spoolers are
picky about the client's port, so LPRng tries ports in a given range
which happens to default to 512 thru 1023, but ports 512/513/514 are already
bound (by inetd) and 515 is available (because no spooler is running)...
A fringe case?
Cheers, Roderich
