Folks, moving this call around hidden behing in completely unreviewed
acpi junk is not acceptable.
Either populate_rootfs _is_ safe to be called earlier and then we should
do it always or it's not.  Either way such a change should be posted
separately and reviewd on lkml.
Len, can you please revert "ACPI: basic initramfs DSDT override support"
aka commit 71fc47a9adf8ee89e5c96a47222915c5485ac437 until we've sorted
this out properly?  Thanks.
