How about something under advance kernel hacking options of wherever
the sysrq options is? (and profiling used to live, before it was
always there), or, since the code is rather small, we could perhaps
always have this available.
    Well, I don't want to include this stuff on the stock vmstat code
    right now. I've done an ugly hack in vmstat.c to get the thing to
    work and thats it.
Fair enough, but the comment "please apply" makes me nervous then :)
