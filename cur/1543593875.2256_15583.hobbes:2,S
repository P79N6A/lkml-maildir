I seem to have lots of problems w/ the 2.4 series and PPP..
Everything compiles fine, and boots fine, but try and run pppd, and "This
kernel as no support of PPP.."
PPP is shown in dmesg:
PPP generic driver version 2.4.1
PPP Deflate Compression module registered
PPP BSD Compression module registered
I had this problem 2.4.5 earlier, but it went away when i applied Alans ac9
patch, but now the problem seems to stay, and I am quite stuck.
