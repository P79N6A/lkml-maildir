If you can assume that processes accessing the values are cooperative,
it already works without any changes:
  $ time flock /sys/class/firmware echo 1 > /sys/class/firmware/timeout
  real    0m0.005s
  $ flock /sys/class/firmware sleep 5&
  [1] 6468
  $ time flock /sys/class/firmware echo 1 > /sys/class/firmware/timeout
  real    0m3.558s
