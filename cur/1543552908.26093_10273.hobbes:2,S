I have attached a very small patch (test9) to remove the kernel lock from
kernel/acct.c. If I am missing something major (a brain?), I apologise in
advance. I have tested this on my UP x86 with spinlock debugging. I would
appreciate comments or an explanation of why this can't be done if you have
the time. Thanks.
