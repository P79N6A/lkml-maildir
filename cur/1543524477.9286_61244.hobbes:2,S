This is a bad idea! This "divorce" should be undone whenever someone
has a chance!
DVD RAM drives currently require a gross hack to allow them to be
driven by both the disk driver (to write to the device), and as a
CDROM drive (to allow cdrom ioctls like play track).
A common driver that has a bunch of flags (removeable, writeable,
play-able: hd: 010, cd: 101, mo: 110, dvd: 111) would work best....
