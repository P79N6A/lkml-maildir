*nod*.  This code has been around for many many years ;-)

Heh, you're so focused on perf tuning, Andrew!  It's not a matter of
locking, it's a matter of semantics.  Here's the comment:
 *  FL_FLOCK locks never deadlock, an existing lock is always removed before
 *  upgrading from shared to exclusive (or vice versa). When this happens
 *  any processes blocked by the current lock are woken up and allowed to
 *  run before the new lock is applied.

I think that's the right thing to do.  If I understand right, we'll
check needs_resched at syscall exit, so we don't need to do it for
unlocks, right?
