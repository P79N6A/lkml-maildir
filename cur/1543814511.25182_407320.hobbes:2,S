It doesn't matter, the user and the kernel never access the other
alias, since the are accessing the page using only that particular
color.

When you initially allocate a page, you make stores to initialize
it's contents, so aliasing doesn't matter from the perspective.
The stores will show up in the correct mappings in the D-cache.
The UltraSPARC programmer's reference manual even states this
explicitly: "A change in virtual color when allocating a free
page does not require a D-cache flush because the D-cache is
write-through."
