Indeed. But the information needs to be made available by the serial hardware 
in order that my line discipline can behave correctly.

I am referring to:
"Normative Parts of PROFIBUS -FMS, -DP, -PA according to the European 
Standard EN 50 170 Volume 2", Edition 1.0, Profibus Nutzerorganisation e.V. 
(PNO), March 1998.
As far as I recall (it's been a while since I actually read it), it says that
the end of a packet is signified by an idle time of 27 bit times on the wire.
Therefore, I would like some way to find out from the serial hardware when 
such an idle period happens.
I don't expect this to be used by all line disciplines, but I would like it to 
be made possible by whatever API we decide upon.
