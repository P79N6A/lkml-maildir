Are these problems only present in -mm kernels?  Does 2.6.13-rc4 work OK?

Well it looks like ACPI committed suicide, so there's probably not much
point looking at the other things until that gets addressed.
Would you have time to raise a kernel bugzilla entry for this?  Raise it
against the ACPI AML interpreter, version 20050708 and mention the above
failure.  The output of acpidump (from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/pmtools-20050727.tar.gz
)
will probably be asked for.
Thanks.
