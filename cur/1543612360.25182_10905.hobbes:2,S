What about decreasing counter by 1 for each sched_yield() call ?
Is this case we achieve ( expecially with the counter decay patch ) a
correct task recycling w/out lock acquiring inside the system call.

Ingo, you've to admit that having separate run queue with separate locks
is just more than a benchmark fix, it's matter of sane design.
