I don't know how to track down udev errors, unfortunately.
I now suspect that the problems I am having with network
device names getting messed up and this problem with
the sound drivers spring from the same cause (some
failure in device setup in udev).
Any suggestions on how to track down udev issues are
most appreciated!  I am curious to know whether this
is a bug in udev or in the kernel code.
Thanks,
