As far as the applications are concerned, xdpyinfo is more what you want.
However, this will give you the virtual resolution, not the physical res.

Linux actually switches quickly - it's your monitor that can't.  You don't even
have to have the same colour depth - all you really need to ensure is that the
refresh rates for X and console are closely matched, and the monitor will not
detect any difference during the switch.
(Disclaimer: on some really really cheapo video hardware, you may get a
glitch, but I think that would be unlikely to be picked up with todays
monitors).
