What you're seeing is a tripple fault. I don't know why this is happening,
but usually it has something to do with the double-fault mechanism being
damaged (or not set-up) when a double-fault occurs. You mentiuon 386 - I
rememeber in OS/2 we have many work-arounds for Intel processor errata - it
might be possible that Linux hasn't catered for all the I32 386 errata -
some of these errata apply to memory management and that's significant
since a tripple fault is often caused by either stack faults or descriptor
faults - both memory problems (I am assuming without checking the Linux
uses a task switch for a double-fault, if it doesn't then a simple
double-fault caused by a stack exception in ring 0 will result ina tripple
fault.).
Again, if this is a 386 issue then you should be aware of the increased
instrcution set for 486, 586 etc..

Subject:  2.4 kernel problems on 386
I'm trying to get a linux-2.4.0-test9-pre7 kernel with riel's recent
memory swap patch going on a 386 - swapping problems with the 2.2.15
kernel I was using prompted this.
I'm trying to make it run on a bull netstation, which means using bootp
and etherboot tagged kernels.
When I compile using gcc version 2.95.2, the resultant kernel reboots
the machine each time its starts up - it does not get started. When
I compile using gcc2.7.2.3, the machine just halts, with "Ok, booting
the kernel" staying on the screen.
I am not on the kernel list, so please send me any replies.
I have not at this stage tried to see if any non patched versions of
the kernel will work, nor have I tried to see if the kernel boots on
my Pentium Pro (but could do so with some prompting).
Regards,
