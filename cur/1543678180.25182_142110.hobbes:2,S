   The whole interface of the bzlib was modelled after the zlib
   interface.
The zlib interface is actually problematic, it doesn't allow
handling of scatter-gather lists on input or output for example.
Therefore we couldn't make the compress cryptolib interface
take scatterlists elements either, which is a huge problem.
