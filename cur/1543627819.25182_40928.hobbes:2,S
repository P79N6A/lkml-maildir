cc'ed Brian - this is your io.h cleanup patch

Ah, OK, I missed that - makes more sense now ;-).

Hmmm ... not sure why the compiler complains about the second one,
that's very strange ;-)

The cleanups we gained in io.h by Brian's patch more than compensate
for this, but it's still a shame to have to do.
I wonder if we can play the same trick we've played before ....
haven't tested the appended, but maybe it, or something like it
will work without the ifdef's?
