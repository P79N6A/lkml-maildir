"some information is preserved by the ACPI platform" is sort of mis-leading.
What ACPI adds to the hibernate flow is some platform hooks to handle
wakeup devices, and a platform hook for the actual sleep request.
I'm not aware of any information saved by ACPI during S4 that is
not saved were the hibernate to be done with "acpi=off".
