Stephan,
    I am not sure if you actually requesting anything but here are some
points on this matter.  First and foremost we do not make these cards.
They are made by our customers that we supply chips for.  We do make the
drivers for these boards but they can then be customized by our
customers.  The point is that we do support Linux for our customers and
our customers are not really end-users.  Now since end-users are
indirectly our customers we do supply Linux drivers on request.  Also if
we cannot meet a request for any reason that information is added to our
Marketing data for future driver development.  Due to previous licensing
agreements we cannot release our source code to anyone including our
direct customers and there is no way around that.  Sorry.  Now if you
have a request for a driver please let me know the kernel version being
used as well as the ADSL protocol that you have.  I will see what I can
do to get you a usable driver.
Thank you for your interest in ITeX

I guess I would prefer the hard line: if it states "linux support" there
has to be a driver source - or at least full docs for _any_ requesting
parties. Otherwise the trademark should not be useable at all. If you
provide several "stages" of support, poor "Aunt Tilly" user (is this
already tm'ed? :-) won't be able to understand the difference - and you
distro-guys (this is not meant to be a BadName) want this type of user
to a certain extent.
But this is a very purist point of view.
Beat me,
Stephan
