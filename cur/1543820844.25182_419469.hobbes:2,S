I'll refer you to the 4-line vs 14-line examples. To the C++ trained 
mind, the 4 line segment is much clearer.

I have some experience with kernel code (mucking about the asynchronous 
I/O implementation) and a lot of experience in C++ system code (both 
ring 0 and userspace). What I've written in this thread is a result of 
20+ (can't believe I'm writing that number) years of coding, not 
theoretical studies (I've studied aeronautical engineering but practiced 
it very little; if I talk about that maybe you can use the theory vs 
practice argument).

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
