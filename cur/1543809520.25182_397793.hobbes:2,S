Subject: [PATCH] Fix smpnice high priority task hopping problem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Suresh B. Siddha has reported:
"on a lightly loaded system, this will result in higher priority job 
hopping around from one processor to another processor.. This is because 
of the code in find_busiest_group() which assumes that SCHED_LOAD_SCALE 
represents a unit process load and with nice_to_bias calculations this 
is no longer true (in the presence of non nice-0 tasks)"
Analysis of this problem as revealed that the smpnice code results in 
the weighted load being larger than 1 and this triggers the active load 
balancing code.  However, in active_load_balance(), the migration thread 
fails to take into account itself when deciding if there are any tasks 
to be migrated from its run queue. I.e. even if there is only one other 
task on the run queue other than itself it will still migrate that other 
task.
The attached patch fixes that anomaly.
