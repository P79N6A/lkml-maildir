Hello,
I just encountered the following message:
Nov 12 01:00:10 box kernel: sd(8,17):vs-13075: reiserfs_read_inode2: dead inode read from disk [114 635405 0x0 SD]. This is likely to be race with knfsd. Ignore
I have never seen such output before on this box... 
Is this message interesting for anybody?
Regards,
Stephan
