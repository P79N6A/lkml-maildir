The second call will do the work if there's something to do. If somebody
did an open/read/writes/close in the middle, it should do the work as
usual. I actually can see a problem if you use the different inodes, but
that will be sorted out too automatically as soon as we stop pinning the
inodes.

Yes, that part should be rewritten using the bdev as you did recently,
the ipinning of the ramdisk also in the previous 2.4 kernels (before
your recent patch) had the same problem of my ipinning in the blkdev
highlevel (it looked only a cleanup but it wasn't).
