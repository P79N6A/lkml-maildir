It seems not.  It failed on two successive boots last night, but
this morning I booted the machine 3 times and the joystick was
recognized just fine each time.
Flaky hardware?  The plug is screwed in and the joystick works
just fine (as far as I can tell) when in use.
I'll continue to keep an eye on this.
