Yes, within UML for example. 
I have a little project to imlement a "userloop" filesystem, which
works just like "mount -o loop", but you don't need root privs.  This
is really simple to do with FUSE and UML.
I don't think that it's far feched, that in certain situations the
user _does_ have the right (and usefulness) to do otherwise privileged
filesystem operations.
