Fine. I was trying to define a back-compat version of recalc_sigpending_tsk()
too, before going through all the code and changing recalc_sigpending(current)
to recalc_sigpending and recalc_sigpending(other) to recalc_sigpending_tsk() 
- but as you rightly point out there's no justification for using the latter
in any of the driver or fs code that I'm trying to support - and hence it
isn't present, and doesn't need the compat support.
