This is total nonsense.  Please don't confuse matters by spreading
misinformation like this.  Every task has a separate (8K) kernel
stack.  Look at the implementation of do_fork() and in particular
alloc_task_struct().
If there were only one kernel stack, what do you think would happen if
a process went to sleep in kernel code?
