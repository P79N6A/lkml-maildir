No, it turns two problems into one.  We have the problem you describe
anyway, there is no point avoiding it here.  It remains unsolved, but
that's just one problem left, not two.
Would it make sense to switch stacks if memory allocation has to free
other memory first?  Sounds a bit insane, but that problem needs a
solution as well.
