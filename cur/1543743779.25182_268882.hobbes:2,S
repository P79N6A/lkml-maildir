I am talking about slightly different thing. Think of some operation
that calls find_or_create_page(). find_or_create_page() doesn't know
about memory reserved in mempools, it uses alloc_page() directly. If one
wants to guarantee that compound operation has enough memory to
complete, memory should be reserved at the lowest level---in the page
allocator.

Either you are kidding, or we are facing very different workloads. In
the world of file-system development, file-system is (not surprisingly)
single largest memory consumer.

Add here mmap that can dirty all physical memory behind your back, and
delayed disk block allocation that forces ->writepage() to allocate
potentially huge extent when memory is already tight and hope of having
a proof becomes quite remote.
