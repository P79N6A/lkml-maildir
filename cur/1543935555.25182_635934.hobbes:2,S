Actually since this will probably take very long on a slower machine you can refer to 
http://halobates.de/allyes/
for some allyes buildlogs of recent kernels for i386 and x86-64. A trick to quickly check
if something compiles is also to do
make allyesconfig
make path/to/file.o 
That won't catch linker errors, but if you don't have warnings there are normally no
linker errors either.
