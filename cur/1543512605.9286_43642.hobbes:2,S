    I think that if /dev/printer/0 is controlled by a lkm'ed driver,
    that's exactly what happens, no matter what.   I'd expect that in
    the devd case, you'd have to populate /dev with every possible
    device so that you could actually do the open, have the kernel tell
    kmod to load the driver, then the information would go off to devd
    to, ummm....

                   \/    to be slightly less useful than the male nipple.
