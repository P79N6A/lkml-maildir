By introducing extra overhead, which is difficult to get rid of again.

The ppc64 converts the timebase directly to a timeval, your code puts the 
nanosecond step inbetween.

What exactly?

You forgot the cyc2ns conversions. Compare this now to some simple 32bit 
math executed every 100ms. Just look at all 32bit archs which use the 
generic do_div and you get an idea, who will not be happy with your new 
code.
Why do you do the adjustment at _every_ call? Why don't you take advantage 
of the fact, that you can be called regularly? In a tick based system you 
can be called every n*tick_nsec ns (without even the need to read a 
possibly expensive timer offset), in a cycle counter system you can 
trigger a call when the counter is past a certain value. In either case 
you know the callback function is called on average in a regular interval, 
so you can precompute adjustments based on this. Ignoring this possibility 
looks like a huge step back to me.
bye, Roman
