 Probably nothing can be done about that, either.  Handling invalid segment
with another hardware task doesn't help since the trap occurs in the context
of the new task and there's no way to tell what happened by then.

 I never even implemented the above checks; there is just a comment in the code
where they belong. It ran for five days that way, then generated a string
of segfaults while trying to shut down.

 Forgot all about that one.  Maybe pushing cs:eip and flags onto the kernel's
stack and returning to an iret in the kernel task would work?
