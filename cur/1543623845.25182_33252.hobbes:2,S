Only doing a given merge once is great.  That's a big time-saver over the
long term.
} 1) working merges
} 
} 2) atomic checkins of entire patches, fast tags
} 
} 3) graphical 2-way merging tool like bitkeeper has
}    (this might not seem essential to people who have
}    never used it, but it has saved me many many hours)
} 
} 4) distributed repositories
} 
} 5) ability to exchange changesets by email
}
