Our performance data demonstrated that the potential gain for the 
non-hugepage case is much higher than 3%.

True, but this needs to be balanced against the fact that pagetable 
sharing will reduce the number of page faults when it is achieved.  
Let's say you have N processes which touch all the pages in an M page 
shared memory region.  Without shared pagetables this requires N*M page 
faults; if pagetable sharing is achieved, only M pagefaults are required.

My perspective is that, once the customer is required to invoke "echo 
XXX > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages" they've left the "out-of-the-box" 
domain, and entered the domain of hoping that the number of hugepages is 
sufficient, because if it's not, they'll probably need to reboot, which 
can be pretty inconvenient for a production transaction-processing 
application.
