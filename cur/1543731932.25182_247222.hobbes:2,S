Thanks. Yes I realize that and understand why this is a good idea to have. But 
most of the verify_command list seems fine and I find the following works, 
but don't know if this is any 'safer' or not... This is the particular test 
that makes the difference to k3b/cdrecord, but I don't know enough to work 
out what it actually does... (this is with 2.6.9-rc1-bk6)
