Yup.

This is the big question with this patch.  How incestuous do I want to
get with the VM system in order to get it to free up pages?  For now,
I decided to be fairly hands-off, allocate as many pages as I can get,
and return the total number to the host.  The host, if it wasn't happy
with the results, can wait a bit while the UML notices that it is
really low on memory and frees some up, and then hit up the UML for
the remainder.

I can write one up.  I did some quick grepping, and there are a good
number of constant over-estimates, plus some which might be in danger
with an large number of devices, plus one (kallsyms.c) which actually
does some sane-looking approximate math to get a reasonable number (which
is then doubled).

Yes, but there should be some checking of this beforehand.
Drop this version for now, and I'll send a new one to cover these
problems plus the one that BlaisorBlade pointed out.
