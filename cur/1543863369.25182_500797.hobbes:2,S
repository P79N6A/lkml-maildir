There are two bad choices right?
1. Scan for reference bits
   Bad because we may have to scan quite a bit without too much
   result. LRU allows us to defer this until memory is tight.
   Any such scan will pollute the cache and cause a stall of
   the app. You really do not want this for a realtime system.
2. Take faults on reference and update the page state.
   Bad because this means a fault if the reference bit
   has not been set. Could be many faults.
Clock pro really requires 2 right? So lots of additional page faults?
