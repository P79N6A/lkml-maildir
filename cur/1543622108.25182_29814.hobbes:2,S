I have STL2 mainboard with 2 PIII 1GHz. Linux kernel 2.4.17. I've not got 
Ops'es, but if I write ps, my terminal gets blocked,I tried it as a superuser 
and normal user several times, after reboot (MagicSysReq only works) 
everything is OK. I don't know where is a bug (it may be in ps?).
procps-2.0.7-11. Where and What shold I send?
