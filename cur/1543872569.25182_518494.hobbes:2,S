thanks for the compliment ;-) _I_ very much know what to do (i mailed 
the right person after all ;), but i dont really count and on the 6 
systems i tried s2ram said on 5 that it's 'unknown', i assumed it could 
possibly be due to the visible lack of clear instructions on that 
webpage ;-)

Probably tweaking the webpage doesnt help because people dont get there 
- as the results plainly show it. Maybe some more automation would be 
useful too, a tool that detects failed resume and tries all those 
options that makes sense on that box or something? It's not like that 
people dont _try_ suspend/resume on Linux, it's just that they find it 
doesnt work and there is no clear mortal-usable (end-user-) way of 
fixing it and submitting the result of that fixing.
