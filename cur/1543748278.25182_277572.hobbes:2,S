On most architectures much of the /dev/kmem and /dev/mem implementation
can be shared, so I'm not sure its worth splitting it out into its own
file. I don't think the current ARCH_HAS_DEV_MEM approach is too ugly.
[The reason that read/write is different on arch xen is that we need to
explicitly map/unmap the I/O pages before accesing them].
