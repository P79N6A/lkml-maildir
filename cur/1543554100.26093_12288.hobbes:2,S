For bus_to_virt() to give a usable virtual address, such a virtual 
mapping must exist and additionnally be part of the linear kernel 
mapping. A PCI MMIO address is generally _not_ even mapped by default 
by the kernel.
On the other hand, bus_to_virt() hasn't the proper semantic for your
problem, since it applies to main memory addresses as seen from the PCI
BUS, and you want an MMIO address usable by the CPU (=virtual).
Hmmm... ioremap() just create a virtual mapping for the CPU to access 
the MMIO window of your PCI chip just fine.
