For futher information only, analysing this further, we keep switching
to the events/0 thread, and it seems to be mainly for:
  - cursor handling every 200ms
  - slab cache reaping about every 2s
The cursor timer is firing all the time that you have a fbcon console
registered, whether or not the cursor should be displayed.  Someone
looking to save power should probably tackle this such that the cursor
timer doesn't needlessly fire.
But I guess the cellphone people would be more interested in this
problem than the big iron desktop-breaking in-need-of-three-phase-supply
boxen. 8)
