yeah - you are right. I wasn't thinking.
Can anyone comment on UGA or other console devices?

Is anyone else considering using kexec() to recover from a oops/panic?
What is the risk calling multiple device_shutdown() will expose another panic?
While calling a device specific cleanup is best, I worry about how
much code/data gets touched in this path. I was hoping something
simple like twiddling bus master bit would be sufficient.
If it's not, oh well.
