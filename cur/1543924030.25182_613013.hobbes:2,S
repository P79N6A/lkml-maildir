Per a suggestion by David Brownwell, rebuilt with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG enabled and 
loading usbserial and ti_usb_3410_5052 with debug=1, I see in 'dmesg'
'drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: wrong number of endpoints'
 which is pretty much what I expected, throwing some more printk's in 
usb-serial gives:
drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: num_interrupt_in = 0, expected 1
drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: num_interrupt_out = 0, expected 0
drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: num_bulk_in = 0, expected 1
drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c: num_bulk_out = 1, expected 1
Okay, so

Changing num_interrupt_in and num_bulk_in from 1 to NUM_DONT_CARE makes 
ti_usb_3410_5052 work again, but is it the right thing to do?
