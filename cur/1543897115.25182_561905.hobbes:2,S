There are 2 ways to compile -fstack-protector supporting glibc actually,
only one opens /dev/urandom on every program initialization, the other
computes the stack guard from some bits of the stack address (so indirectly
depends on get_random_int() in stack randomization).
Nevertheless, having one random long (32-bit for 32-bit arches, 64-bit
otherwise) in aux vector would be useful.
