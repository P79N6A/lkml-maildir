Maybe he's afraid that customers will see that the hardware design is
absolute garbage with thousands of defective-hardware-work-arounds in
software. If so, don't worry! I don't think there is a piece of digital
hardware remaining on the planet that doesn't require software playing
nurse-maid. And everybody knows that if a decision has to be made to
re-do a PWB at $150,000 a pop, or to invent some software work-arounds,
the work-arounds will always win. Besides, software is "free". Once it's
done and the software engineers laid-off, you just clone in over-and-over
again. Ask any production manager.
I know of a company that has WOM (Write Only Memory) right in the
middle of some RAM address space. Guess what? It's memory-mapped and
'owned' by some sleeping giant!
