My guess is turn off UDMA, I think we have a www.namesys.com/faq.html entry on
that which you can read and see if my memory of the typical symptoms of flaky
udma are correct.  Commenting on the cause of flaky udma I will leave to others
familiar with your mob's interaction with Linux, except to say that one should
always check cables at a time like this.
