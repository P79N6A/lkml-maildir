Can anyone explain what the point is to allow specifying the APIC model (for i386 Linux and both i386 and x86-64 Xen) on
the command line, yet overriding it unconditionally if the MPS and/or the ACPI tables indicate a special system?
Shouldn't the APIC replacement be suppressed in that case?
Thanks, Jan
