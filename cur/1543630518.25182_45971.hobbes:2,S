  As an FYI to the group the OSDL has put out a
RFQ for equipment to build a IB development environment
and I was wondering if any of the possible developers
would like to comment on the mix.

  The idea is to have enough equipment that folks can
test out a range of configurations.  Once things
progress we will add more.
