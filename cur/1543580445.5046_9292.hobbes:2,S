Start with the right history then
Ross Biro did the original Linux networking code. At the time the 386BSD code
was potentially useful but two things occurred
1.	I asked a real lawyer about mixing BSD and GPL code and got told the
	advertising clause was an additional restriction
2.	BSDI got sued, making the entire BSD codebase potentially contaminated
Someone in .de (Alas I forget their name now) actually did port BSD net/2 to
Linux.
FvK took over and then I took over and we had net2debugged (no relation to
BSD net/2) and then net/3 and net/4 over time.
The 1.0 networking code worked but certainly wasnt BSD grade, the 1.2 code
worked better but wasnt BSD grade. 2.0 was certainly on a par and 2.2/2.4
have added a lot of other stuff. *BSD has also not stood still.
You can certainly find cases where either is better.

Humph. TOPS-10 is a beautiful OS.
