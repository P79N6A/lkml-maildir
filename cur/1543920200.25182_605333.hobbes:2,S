FWIW, the gdth driver was "super-messy".  With this latest SCSI pull, 
that severity has been successfully downgraded to "messy" :)
IMO some easy-to-fix breakage was inevitable with such a large volume of 
fundamental changes.
Honestly, the driver is probably rarely run by people that lack the 
hardware, I bet...
