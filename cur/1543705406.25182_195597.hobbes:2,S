Because normally the X server reads them in very quick succession and if
you don't make a very short click, the sequence looks like this:
push1 push2 release1 release2, which is fine, because X interprets that
as just a push and a release.
If there is disk activity or something else that causes the scheduling
to be delayed, it's push1 release1 push2 release2, which counts as a
doubleclick.
Hence sporadic doubleclicking.
For movement, of course, you get twice the mouse speed, but usually most
people just adjust the acceleration settings and are done with that.
