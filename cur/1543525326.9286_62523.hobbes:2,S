God knows :-) But every process SHOULD have /dev/tty as current tty for process
("the name of device /dev/tty is alias of terminal name used to log in system"
backword translation from Russian translation). It's outlined in my "The UNIX
Programming Environment" by Kernighan & Pike back from 1984 this way and I bet
used in LOTS AND LOTS of programs. Even if it's not required by POSIX...

There are should be configuration file somewhere I think :-)

Yes and no. There are no natural way to define "current" tty if PROGRAM can
work with more then one monitor and keyboard equally. Unfortunatelly this is
not a choice: programs are NOT ready to work in such environment. Most
programs do not care much about multihead. They just want something as
its terminal (think about things like "crypt"). So /dev/tty should be
defined somehow even with multihead: otherwise LOTS of programs will break.
I'm not know how it'll be done, though. But it will ne done for sure.
/dev/ttyN and friends (including /dev/tty0) on other hand are Linux-specific
(it's usad by programs like XFree86 or GPM) and most should be rewritten for
multihead anyway.
