Actually experiments with async processing in POHMELFS lead to the
conclusion, that if protocol waits until request is completed and does
not proceed with the next one (like CIFS and somewhat NFS), such design
does not scale to multiple parallel IOs.
That from different angle shows benefits of caching and aiming at
getting as much performance as possible from single node connection :)
