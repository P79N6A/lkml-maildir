Martin,
I have been seeing system hangs on my 16 processor numaq while running
contest.  The system will hang within a few seconds to half an hour. 
Unfortunately there is no stack trace or any other indication on the
system console.  I have been running your 2.5.62-mjb2 without problems
previously.  Any ideas what I can do to narrow this down?
Mark.
