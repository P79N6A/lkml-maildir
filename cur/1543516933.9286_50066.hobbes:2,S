Any reason why the networking code wouldn't like to run in ROM?
I can boot a farily functional kernel from ROM without networking, but with
networking it fails right after "IP Protocols: ICMP, UDP, TCP".  I've traced
it and it seems to fail in various places inside networking, depending on
what else I build into the kernel and how I initialize data (copy
initialzation data to cached or uncached ram).
Oh, there's a twist:  I can get it to run with networking in uncached ROM,
just not with networking in cached ROM.
Any ideas?  Does it need special alignment?  Does it self-modify?  Any thing
else?
Regards,
Brad
