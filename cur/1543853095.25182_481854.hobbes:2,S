Hmm.  The other possibility is that this is a genirq migration issue.
Yep.  That looks like it.   In the genirq migration the edge and
level triggered cases got merged and previously disable_edge_ioapic
was a noop.  Ouch.
Darn I missed this one in my review of Ingos changes.
I'm not at all certain what the correct fix here is.
- Do we make the make the generic code aware of this messed up
  case?  I believe it is aware of part of the don't disable edge
  triggered interrupt logic already.
- Do we modify the disable logic so it doesn't actually disable the
  irq?
- Do we do as Linus suggests and make the enable logic pass through a
  level triggered state?
- Do we split the edge and level triggered cases apart on again on
  i386 and x86_64?
And how do we make it drop dead clear what we are doing so that
someone doesn't break this in the future by accident.  That I
suspect was the real problem.  That stupid vector == irq case had
introduced so many levels of abstraction it was nearly impossible
to read the code.
Can we get this abstraction right so that we can make obviously
correct code here and still handle all of the weird code bugs?

Sure.  So the hypothesis is that it is somewhere near commit
e7b946e98a456077dd6897f726f3d6197bd7e3b9 causing the problem. 
Anything I have changed in this area should affect both i386 and 
x86_64.

Ok. After a quick skim it appears that there is a disable/enable pair
in the irq migration path for edge triggered interrupts.  But we
do that work while the irq is pending and it doesn't look like I
changed that part of the code.  Just the level triggered irq
migration.

I will share the credit because I missed this in code review but this
is really Ingo's generic irq code.
