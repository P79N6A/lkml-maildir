I had thought most of them were fixed as well.
Looking at the 2.5 code, I found one left-over typedef in ldev_mgr.c, which I 
have just fixed. There are some in the cluster plugin (evms_ecr.c and 
evms_ecr.h), but at the moment that is just a proposed clustering interface, 
since there is no actual cluster support yet. It is likely those files will 
change as the clustering support is added, so they will get cleaned up along 
the way. The rest of the typedef's I'm seeing are all in the OS/2 and S/390 
plugins, which as I mentioned in the first announcement haven't been ported 
to 2.5 yet, and thus haven't gone through any cleanup. When those get ported 
to 2.5, I'll make sure they are cleaned up.
As for improper variable names, can you give me a better idea of where you 
are seeing them? Any specific examples?

It had to be reimplemented in order to fit into the plugin model in EVMS. We 
had many requests from our users about a year ago to support the MD metadata, 
so we added it by porting the existing MD kernel code to an EVMS plugin. Mike 
Tran has been keeping up with Neil Brown's latest MD code for 2.5, in an 
attempt to not greatly diverge the code. I believe Mike intends to talk with 
Neil at some point about seeing if there is a way to provide a common set of 
code/services that could be used by both MD and EVMS.
