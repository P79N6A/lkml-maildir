Hardware constrains the OS, so your view is surely correct. Any ideas how
the IA-64 impacts this discussion? A cursory look into the IA-64 Application
Developer's Architecture Guide is quite interesting. I haven't seen any
reference to SMP issues addressed in there. Is there any other source of
technical descriptions of the IA-64 hardware out there yet?
