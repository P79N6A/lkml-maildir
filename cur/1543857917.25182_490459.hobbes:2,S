Bad wording. Many other filesystems seem to only make use of buffer_new
between prepare and commit_write.
gfs2 seems to at least test it in a lot of places, so it is hard to know
whether we can change the current semantics or not. I didn't mean that
gfs2 is doing anything wrong.
So can we clear it in commit_write?
