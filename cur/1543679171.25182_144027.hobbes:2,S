I taught patch-scripts a new trick:
check_patch()
{
	if grep "^+.*[ 	]$" $P/patches/$1.patch
	then
		echo warning: $1 adds trailing whitespace
	fi
}
+       if (pmd_table != pmd_offset_kernel(pgd, 0)) 
+       pmd = pmd_offset_kernel(pgd, address);         
+#define __pgd_page(pgd)                (__bpn_to_ba(pgd_val(pgd))) 
warning: highpmd adds trailing whitespace
You're far from the worst.   There's some editor out there which
adds trailing tabs all over the place.  I edited the diff.
What architectures has this been tested on?
