I'm surprised that's the recommended solution.  It seems pretty
dangerous to have allocated pages in the system where the per-page
ref counts are bogus.
To clarify then, on an order>0 allocation, it is only valid/defined
to free the same order of pages.  Is that a true statement?  If so,
I'll submit a docs patch and adjust our our local implementation.
Thanks,
