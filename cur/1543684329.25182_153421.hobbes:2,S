	Had you considered getting in touch with the Dell tech team leader 
first before posting to Linux-kernel?  If you had been subscribed to 
Linux-kernel you would have known that Matt Domsch is a semi-regular 
contributor and quite willing to look into issues like this.
	I've CC'd him.  Please consider getting in touch with him first in 
the future before trying to get the entire linux-kernel list involved.  He 
may or may not have the answers you need, but at least he'd be more able 
to identify the right person to contact.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
