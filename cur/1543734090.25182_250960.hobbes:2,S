Ok, so it _isn't_ CONFIG_SERIAL at all.  Grumble.
Anyway, CONFIG_SERIAL_8250 gets set to 'm' because:
$ find . -name 'Kconfig*' | xargs grep 'select SERIAL_8250' -B5
./drivers/char/Kconfig-source "drivers/char/pcmcia/Kconfig"
./drivers/char/Kconfig-
./drivers/char/Kconfig-config MWAVE
./drivers/char/Kconfig- tristate "ACP Modem (Mwave) support"
./drivers/char/Kconfig- depends on X86
./drivers/char/Kconfig: select SERIAL_8250
and you have CONFIG_MWAVE is set to 'm'.  Of course, no surprises you
couldn't work this out - using "select" on a user-visible configuration
symbol is a bloody nightmare and IMHO fundamentally broken.
It seems to have been introduced by this change:
