Oooh... like $PATH maybe? Hmmm... no-one would ever suspect that
something like #!/usr/bin/env perl would already work, solve the
problem people are talking about and be portable.
For other portable solutions, I wish people would read the perlrun and
tclsh man pages before re-inventing the same wheel.
