When doing a 'cp largefile1 largefile2' on the client, I see approx. 10
retransmissions per second in nfsstat.
I don't really know if this is a lot...
I also see packets dropped in ifconfig - approx. 10 per second...  I
wonder if these two are related.
Client has an intel e1000 card - I just set the RX ring buffer to the
max. of 4096 (up from the default of 256), but this doesn't seem to help
a lot (I see the 10 drops/sec with the large RX buffer).
I use NAPI - is there anything else I can do to make the card not drop
packets?   I'm just assuming that this might at least be a part of the
problem, but with large RX ring and NAPI I don't know how much else I
can do to not make the box drop incoming data...

I can try that.
Thanks!
