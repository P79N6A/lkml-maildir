Subject: Kernel 2.6.0 wont let me unmount eth0 upon reboot

I've trying the new kernel. Everything is OK, except that when I shut down my 
machine, I get this message:
unmounting remote filesystems
unregistering_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free. usage count = -4
This last line keeps repeating ad infinitum, until I turn the power down...
Needless to say that with 2.4.21 I don't have this problem.
I have a Fujitsu Lifebook C-7651 laptop, pentium III. My ethernet card is a 
Realtek 8129. I have this in my kernel config file:
# CONFIG_8139CP is not set
CONFIG_8139TOO=m
# CONFIG_8139TOO_PIO is not set
CONFIG_8139TOO_TUNE_TWISTER=y
CONFIG_8139TOO_8129=y
# CONFIG_8139_OLD_RX_RESET is not set
8139too loads, I can get in the internet through my cable modem. If I do rmmod 
8139too I get the same message... I cannot unload the 8139too module.
Any help will be appreciated.
