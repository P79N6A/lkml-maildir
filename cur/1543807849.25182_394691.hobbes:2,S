I like this description; it matches roughly with the concepts as
presented by vserver; there is the process virtualisation (vx_info), and
the network virtualisation (nx_info) of Eric's that has been integrated
to the vserver 2.1.x development branch.  However the vx_info has become
the de facto umbrella object space as well.  These could almost
certainly be split out without too much pain or incurring major
rethinks.
