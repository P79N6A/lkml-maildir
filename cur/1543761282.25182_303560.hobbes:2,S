hm.  I emailed you twice, and had a feeling that things weren't getting
through.
The patch caused those little pixmap buttons across the top of the main
window to vanish when using gtk+-1.2.10-28.1.  See
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/x.jpg.
I now note that scripts/kconfig/gconf.c doesn't compile at all with the
above backout patch.  Drat.
