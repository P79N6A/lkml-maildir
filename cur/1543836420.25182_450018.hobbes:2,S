Subject: [PATCH 00/10] -mm  generic clocksoure API
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch set is meant to modify the clocksource structure and API so that it
can be used by more than just the timekeeping code. My motivation is mainly
that I feel the current clocksource interface could be used for much more
than just timekeeping. So if we keep the clocksource interface (which I think
we should) then we should get everything out of it that we can.
This set modifies the API, then converts the time keeping code over to the new
API. I also added a generic sched_clock() which just re-uses the clocksource
interface to provide a high quality scheduling clock (assuming a good
clocksource). Several ARM board just output nanoseconds based on jiffies which
is still possible with the generic sched_clock().
I tested this on SMP and UP x86, and compile tested for ARM.
