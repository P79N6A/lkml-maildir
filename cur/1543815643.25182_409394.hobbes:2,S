Well mmu_gather uses a per-cpu data structure and is non preemptible,
which I guess is one of the main reasons why we have this preemption
here.
You're right that another good reason would be ptl lock contention,
however I don't think that alleviating that problem alone would allow
longer mmu_gather scheduling latencies, because the longest latency
is still the mmu_gather <--> mmu_finish span.
