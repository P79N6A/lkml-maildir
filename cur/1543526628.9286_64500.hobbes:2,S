The code will be ugly. It is better to push bloat out into libc
than to have it in the kernel.
How about 64-bit nanoseconds? This fixes the year-2038 problem too.
(this is for the VFS and new filesystems)
For ext2, maybe milliseconds or 1/1024 second units would be good.
That fits the 3 normal time stamps into one __u32, of which we have
very few to spare.
