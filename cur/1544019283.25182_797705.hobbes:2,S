Why are you wasting your time in tail-chasing a value? If your load is so 
unpredictable that you can't find a proper upper bound (and it almost 
never is), make it unlimited (or redicoulously high enough).
Warned, by which assumption? That the value rises just as much to hit the 
warn, but not to pass the current limit? How about *fail*, if the burst is 
high enough to hit your inexplicably constrained value?
All this in oder to keep as-close-as-the-peak a value that costs no 
resources in pre-allocation terms.

And, since they didn't know about the new limit, an even less known 
"monitor" would have help in ...?
