Once again, as I said before, a lawyer.  There are currently very few  
GPL-related precedents, and none on that particular topic.  The best  
place to get advice is a lawyer.   Think of it as though you were  
licensing some code from another proprietary company for inclusion in  
your product; there you would _definitely_ talk to a lawyer.  The  
"ultimate authority" is your local/regional/national courts, a local  
lawyer is best able to use your particular set of laws to interpret  
what your courts are likely to decide and advise you accordingly.   
Nobody on this list can give you that kind of legal advice, at least  
not for free.

Any "Derivative Work" of the Linux kernel must be licensed under the  
GPL.  The definition of "Derivative Work" is hard to resolve in  
detail.  Most kernel developers (including Linus himself) believe  
that all kernel modules are derivative works due to the unique and  
variable nature of the in-kernel APIs.  It is almost always held that  
userspace-only programs are _not_ derivative works.  On the other  
hand, if you export some kernel-internal API directly to userspace  
through a syscall, any program that uses it might be considered a  
derivative work.

It really depends, which is why I suggest you contact a lawyer versed  
in this field.  Virtually none of the people on this list can give  
you any definitive answers, especially without access to the product  
itself, and even then they would most likely just tell you of their  
personal opinion which has no legal weight whatsoever.
Cheers,
