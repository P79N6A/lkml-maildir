Subject: [PATCH] kprobes: Fix return probes on x86_64 __switch_to
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/25/248

This patch against 2.6.16-rc1-mm3 fixes a bug in the x86_64
implementation of kprobes that can cause an Oops or crash when a return
probe is installed on __switch_to().  On x86_64, when __switch_to()
is called, we're running on the next task's stack but current points
to the previous task.  The fix handles this special case, causing the
kretprobe_instance to be hashed with the next task, where it will be
sought when __switch_to() returns.  Please apply.

Fixes a bug in the x86_64 implementation of kprobes that can cause
an Oops or crash when a return probe is installed on __switch_to().
On x86_64, when __switch_to() is called, we're running on one task's
stack but current points to a different task.  The fix adds code to
handle this special case.
