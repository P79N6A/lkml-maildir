Again, you haven't *proven* this yet.

Generate a random permutation group *how*?  This sounds suspiciously
like "reverse the polarity of the neutron flow" technobabble to me.
What are you going to compare the groups against?  What subgroup?  How
big of a group do you think it is going to be?  So you really think
the output of SHA is going to produce a group with subgroups?

References, please and exactly how this would apply to the situation
at hand?  This sounds like math babble to me, and I have taken enough
abstract algebra and other math class that this sounds suspiciously to
me like the sort of stuff that Star Trek actors make up when the
script says "insert technobabble here".  Of course, I'm not a math
major, so I'm willing to accept the possibility that you know what
you're talking about --- but I do know enough that I should be able to
evaluate any proofs and math papers you want to throw at me.
