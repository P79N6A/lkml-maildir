Just a few technical comments on aspects of your patch:

I would prefer to keep these definitions in the usb-storage driver.  They 
refer to dynamic aspects of an individual device, not static blacklist or 
ID-matching for all devices of a particular type.  As such, they are of no 
interest to ub or libusual.

The two types of operations are used to write these flags at strictly
different times.  The shift/mask operations are used while initializing
the data structures and the set_bit-style operations are used after
everything has been set up and the device is operational.
Once the device is running, the shift/mask operations are used _only_ for
reading, never for writing.  This is true for all of the static flags, not
just GO_SLOW and NO_WP_DETECT.  There shouldn't be anything wrong or
illegal about it.  I don't see how it could possibly cause any kind of
error or problem.
It's true that two separate words could be used for the two kinds of flag
bits.  But since they coexist peacefully now, there doesn't seem to be any
need.
