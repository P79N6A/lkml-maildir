Agreed.  The only alternative I recall seeing proposed was my own
cartesian-product macro suite that encodes parameter types into the
marker function/macro name itself.  (Maybe some of that could be
hidden with gcc typeof() magic.)  There appeared to be a consensus
that this was more undesirable.  Do you agree?

The effect of the immediate-values patch, combined with gcc
CFLAGS+=-freorder-blocks, *is* to keep the overhead at 1-2
dcache-impact-free instructions.  The register saves, parameter
evaluation, the function call, can all be moved out of line.

Yes, but those registers will already be used, so their former values
need to be saved or later recomputed as a part of the call sequence.
Even wrapping it all with an asm barrier may not be enough to
completely bound the code with an address range that can be naively
NOP'd out.

It's more than that - people will want to pass some dereferenced
fields from a struct*; some old function parameters that were by the
time of the marker call shoved out of registers again.  Register
constraints that prohibit general expressions would impede the
utility of the tool.

Almost all of that can & should be moved out of line.
