The "eth%d" thing is a format string, but unrelated to printk.  The %d 
is replaced with the ethernet interface number by the system.  That 
cosmetic bug is a holdover from olden days, when the ethernet interfaces 
would do
    register ethernet interface, get a number
    if we fail, release the number
So with the old system, it's possible that the user might be
    eth0: error cannot load, aborting [first NIC]
    eth0: error cannot load, aborting [second NIC]
    eth0: error cannot load, aborting [third NIC]
The new system, which is hotplug-friendly, makes it impossible to know 
the ethernet interface number until you _really_ are sure the NIC is ok 
to use.  Therefore, "eth%d" is "dev->name" that has not been translated 
yet.  The fix is simple, replace "eth%d" with "tulip%d" in the printk 
message, and use the board count instead of ethernet interface number.
