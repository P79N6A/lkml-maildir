well, they will sooner or later notice that it's easier to fix bugs by
following the development of the kernel and understanding the underlying
principles and the code. As elitist as it might seem, we rather need 10
highly skilled developers who understand the kernel than 100 moderately
skilled ones who know how to operate a kernel debugger and barely anything
else. [this is not an insult towards people with less experience - having
less experience is just a temporary stage of a process, nothing else. But
if it becomes the end station thats a problem IMHO.]
