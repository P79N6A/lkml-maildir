I've just re-tested this with 2.6.0-test6, and the problem persists.
Red Hat 2.4.20-20.7smp works fine.
I'm booting both 2.4 and 2.6 kernels with: init=/bin/sh apm=debug
without starting any daemons, or having any PCMCIA socket drivers
loaded.  apm debug messages appear to be identical between 2.4 and
2.6 kernels.

If that is so, how do we go about debugging this type of problem?
I've tried the obvious of disabling virtually all drivers, and this
doesn't appear to make any difference what so ever.  I'm guessing
that something in the core i386 architecture code is causing the
problem.
