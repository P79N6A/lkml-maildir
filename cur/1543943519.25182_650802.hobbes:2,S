I was responding to the start of item #2 that I left in the quote above. 
it asn't saying that SCST didn't support that, but was stating that any 
implementation of a iSCSI target should use the SCSI framework. I read 
this to mean that this would only be able to access things that the SCSI 
framework can access, and that would not be things like ramdisks, raid 
arrays, etc.
