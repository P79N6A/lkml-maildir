Hi!
Thanks, Russell. Marcel, this is probably solution to that oops.

Ok, you're in uart_flush_buffer(), and we got there through the
ldisc being closed.

Looking at release_dev(), it does things in the following order:
1. various sanity checks
2. close the driver
3. more sanity checks and other housekeeping
4. close the ldisc
5. reset the ldisc for the tty to N_TTY
This means that bluetooth is calling into a TTY driver with a tty
for which the driver has already shut down.  No surprise it oopses.
Bluetooth should not call the driver during it's closedown.
(There also appears to be an interesting race condition between the
driver shutting down and the ldisc write functions getting to know
about it... Alan?)
