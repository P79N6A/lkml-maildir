If you mean by management I don't know, acutally I didn't much in
respect of IDE
since Mark Lord's departure (to express it euphemetically).
But I rememeber that he promised to imeplement a new "dancing" version
of hdparm based on the stuff above. And where is it? No I'm never going 
to mess with my hd by catting some magic values here and there. It's
just
to error prone for my taste...
And then I know about several admins who complain about IDE performance
on
heavy load system, who just didn't figure out how to enable BM-DMA on
the corresponding
boxes, where it doesn't get turn on by defalut due to the linux
distributors desire
to "play safe"...
