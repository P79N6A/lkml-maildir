	Most LVMs support mirroring as an essential function.  They
don't usually support RAID5, leaving that to hardware.
	I certainly don't want to have to deal with two disparate
systems to get my code up and running.  I don't want to be limited in my
mirroring options at the block device level.
	DM supports mirroring.  It's a simple 1:2 map.  Imagine this LVM
volume layout, where volume 1 is data and mirrored, and volume 2 is some
scratch space crossing both disks.
	[Disk 1]	[Disk 2]
	  [volume 1]	  [volume 1 copy]
          [       volume 2              ]
	If DM handles the mirroring, this works great.  Disk 1 and disk
2 are handled either as the whole disk (sd[ab]) or one big partition on
each disk (sd[ab]1), with DM handling the sizing and layout, even
dynamically.
	If MD is handling this, then the disks have to be partitioned.
sd[ab]1 contain the portions of md0, and sd[ab]2 are managed by DM.  I
can't resize the partitions on the fly, I can't break the mirror to add
space to volume 2 quickly, etc.
