Subject: linksys workgroup switch works like a hub

It is really weird!
Host_10.1--->10.254_router_1.254--->Linksys 5-port workgroup switch-->Host1.1
                                       |               |
                                       |               |
                                       v               v
                                    Host_1.10        Host_1.5
Host_10.1 sends 1000 packets/s (pps) to Host_1.10. Host_1.10 receives the
packets. But Host_1.5 receives the packets too, while Host_1.1 does not
(by tcpdump -i any).
	What is the possible reason?
	Thanks!
