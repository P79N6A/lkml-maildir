IMO, you definitely want TCP and NFSv4.  Much better network behavior, 
with some of the silly UDP limits (plus greatly improved caching 
behavior, due to v4 delegations).

Read-ahead is easier in NFSv4, because the client probably has the file 
delegated locally, and has far less need to constantly revalidate file 
mapping(s).
