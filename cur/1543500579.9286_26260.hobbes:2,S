I'm running 2 smp boxes, one at home (dual pII 450 o/cd to 504, 256mb ram)
and one at work (dual p233mmx 256mb ram) and I haven't had any X problems. 
My home machine runs stock 2.2.7 and my work machine uses 2.2.10 (becuase of
smp fix for 3c509).
Both of my machines use ttyS0 for the mouse.  My home uses /dev/ttyS0, my
work uses /dev/gpmdata (gpm uses /dev/ttyS0 as well).
Anyway, I'm not having problems.  Could it be hw?
