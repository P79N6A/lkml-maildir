Why? Problems are hardly solved by adding more parameters.
If going to a larger number space means, that we have to add crappy 
interfaces, we should rather keep it as it is.
Why do you need to partition the number space like this? I looked at the 
users in the last mail for a reason. If we're going to change the 
interface, it should reflect what we will need in the future.
bye, Roman
