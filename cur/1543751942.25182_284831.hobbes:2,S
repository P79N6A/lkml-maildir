Actually I want to know the how hotplugging works under 2.6 and what is the
information flow and how a user can do this.
Secondly is it support PnP of iSCSI disks? If yes then it has support in
kernel or any patch is nedded? If no then what are the problems.

It works the same, only better :)
Specifically what are you curious about?  Have you read the
linux-hotplug.sf.net documentation?
