And then think, why do you need to _build_ drivers in the first place. 
Wouldn't it be better to have one vmware.ko which insmod's with all 2.6 versions , from 2.6.0 to 2.6.16-rc2 , 
and throw "upgrade pain" away completely ?

All over the net ? Again, you're proving stable API/ABI supporters nicely. 
If kernel has stable ABI, basic/default driver is included on installation CD, and all you need to do 
is to launch ./install-linux.sh from CD in your shell or click OK and enter your root password in GUI box.
Newer/better driver - just go to device manufacturer's website, download installation package and install this driver. 
Without rebuilding.

And what to do if you've bought new hardware, installed it and _voila_ - NO IN-TREE DRIVER exists ?
Do you want every Linux user  going for shopping to nearest WalMart carry full linux hardware compatibility list printed out ?
Or intree driver list ?

Wrong. Latest kernel is latest kernel. Latest driver is latest driver. They are different entities, and don't mix'em.

So who to blame ? Maybe, just look at those who don't want stable driver API ?

Please, don't force your preferences over others'
