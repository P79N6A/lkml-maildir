Hello !
After several tests, I have noticed that I can produce this problem 
easily when my bdflush settings are:
30   50      32      100     50      300   60       0       0
and it occurs very less frequently when my settings are:
2       50      32      100     50      300     1       0       0
Right now, I noticed the following stack trace for one such stuck process:
sys_read
generic_file_read
do_generic_file_read
page_cache_read
__alloc_pages
balance_classzone
try_to_free_pages
shrink_caches
shrink_cache
try_to_release_page
try_to_free_buffer
sync_page_buffers
wait_on_buffer
__wait_on_buffer
schedule
Thanks
