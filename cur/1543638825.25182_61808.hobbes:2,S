Hans,
My recollection is that reiser4 isn't released yet.  Why not
set the reiser4 disk format with 64 bit blocknumbers from
dot?  32 bit archs could write zeros and otherwise ignore
the upper 32 bits and refuse to mount if filesystem size
would cause overflow.  That way you avoid on-disk format
change mid cycle.  That seems a lot less overhead than
coping with different datatypes.
Of course if you'd rather support another on-disk format
to squeeze a bit more data onto small drives i can understand.
