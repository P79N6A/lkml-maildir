That's great and all, but it doesn't change the fact that the
problem, from the Adaptec chip's perspective, is a protocol
violation *on the bus*.  I'm willing to believe that there is
a chip bug in the aic7896/97 if you can provice a SCSI bus trace
indicating that everything is normal on the SCSI bus.

On the same or different controller?

To diagnose why things are hung will require you to grovel around
in the SCSI data structures to determine why I/O is hung.  Perhaps
use kdb to change the SCSI loging level after the hangs start, then
try access to another device and see where the traces lead you?  I
cannot reproduce the problem here, so it is difficult for me to debug
it.
