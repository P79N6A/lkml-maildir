Costing you 864 megabytes per second?
Lets say the checksum was free. You are then able to INF bytes/per/sec.
So it's costing you INF bytes/per/sec?  No, it's costing you nothing.
If we were not dealing with INF, then 'Cost' is approximately 1/N, not
N. Cost is work_done_without_checksum - work_done_with_checksum. Because
of the low-pass filter pole, these numbers are practically the same.
But, you can get a measurable difference between any two large numbers.
This makes the 'cost' seem high. You need to make it relative to make
any sense, so a 'goodness' can be expressed as a ratio of the cost and
the work having been done.
