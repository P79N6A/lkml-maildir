Please fix the binary incompatibility in the on disk format between the current
code and your new release _before_ you do that. The last patches I was sent
would have screwed every 64bit LVM user.
A new format is fine but import old ones properly. And if you do a new format
stop using kdev_t on disk - it will change size soon
