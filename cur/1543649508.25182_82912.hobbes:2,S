We are not proposing the entire dprobes patch to be in kernel. It doesn't
have to be. We are proposing for inclusion the "kprobes" patchset at
http://www-124.ibm.com/linux/patches/?project_id=141
 which provides
the basic infrastructure in the kernel for setting up and handling
breakpoints automatically in kernel space. Once this small piece is in,
we can implement comprehensive tools like dynamic probes as external
kernel modules without having to patch the kernel.
