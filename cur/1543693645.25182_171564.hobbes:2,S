Hello!
Once again I have to report: Linux 2.6 seems to have problems managing
memory.
After working on a laptop system (with Mozilla, X 4.3.99, Opera, 4xterms)
for some hours the system becomes very slow.
It looks like the system has no memery left, partly programs get
killed (Out of Memory) although there is plenty memory left.
I tried to kill processes to see whether one processes has a memory leak,
but that's not the case.
I even tried to kill all processes and restart everything (with sysrg+k)
but this didn't show any success.
Any ideas where the problem is?
Nico
