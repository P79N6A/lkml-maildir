I agree, but when dealing with devices like CPU and Memory, not sure how the
rest of the Operating System handles surprise removal. For now I will go ahead and
add a PRINTK saying that BUS_CHECK(surprise removal request) was received in the 
ACPI Processor and in the container driver, and when we hit that printk on a 
real hardware, I believe it would be the right time then to see how the OS behaves 
and do the right code then. For Now I will just go ahead and add a PRINTK.
Let me know if this step by step approach is okay to you.
thanks,
Anil
