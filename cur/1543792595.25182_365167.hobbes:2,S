Yes, that would make sense if everyone interested changed the 'unstable'
version instead, since they change the version merged it only creates
problems. And if you DO check out the ipw2200 site you see that there
has been no stable release for about a year and that there has been a
large amount of bugfixes.
Also, the 'stable' version didn't use a separated ieee802.11 stack.
So to summarize:
Merging the latest version of both and then, if someone has problems,
tell them to downgrade would be simpler. This also means that the
ipw2200 team could release patches against the kernel as well as
standalone modules.
The 'stable' version that got merged is more or less useless to people
who are smart about their wlans. And on a side note, even the firmware
has improved since then.
