Heh, that is definiatly a 2.7 thing, too many drivers rely on this
functionality :(

I was trying to point out that pre-mature optimiziation of this code
should not be done before we get rid of the most expensive portion, the
bkl.  That's all.

Oh yeah, I forgot I had cleaned up that api to not reserve minors in
chunks, sorry.  It used to do that :)
So only tty drivers currently do this.  But that might just be because
it's pretty hard to get a range of minors right now, as the api hasn't
been present.  Once we expand the range, I bet it will get quite common
(most character drivers only want from 1-16 minors normally.)

I agree.  But again, 2.7.  Remember our feature freeze?
