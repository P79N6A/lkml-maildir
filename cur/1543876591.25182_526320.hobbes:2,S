Ok, that's what I immagined. Agreed, that's a problem.

Then you'd lose the ability to know if you lost one or more (yes, you 
could figure it out by reading the time and with a few calculations). I 
think that the capping (to a sane value) idea solves the DoS issue and at 
the same time have the ability to report you missed ticks. What are your 
strong points against that solution?
