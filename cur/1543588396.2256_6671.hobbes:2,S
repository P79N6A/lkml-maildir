Hi German,
  try it without connected monitor. It looks to me like that
DDC's SDA and SCL pins are connected to ground in your monitor
and/or your monitor cable. If they are stuck, it takes very long
before i2c code gives up (1s timeout; BTW, there is a bug,
adap->timeout in i2c_bit_add_bus should be set to HZ and not to 100,
if it is doing what I think it does... besides that I thought that
it is caller responsibility to set timeout).
  You should compile i2c-algo-bit as module and use insmod it
with 'bit_test=1' parameter. It should do some tests on these pins
to find whether they are stuck in 0 or in 1. You can also try
'i2c_debug=3' ...
  And last question - which matrox hardware do you have?
                                                    Thanks,
