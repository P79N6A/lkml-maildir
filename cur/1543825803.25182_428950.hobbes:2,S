the problem is that O(1) cpu scheduler doesn't keep the history of 
execution and consumed time which is required for fairness. So I'm 
pretty sure, that fairness will decrease when one of the tasks is being 
capped/uncapped constanntly.
Can you check the behavior of 2 tasks, having different priorites with 
the range of possible cpu limits implied on one of them.

running tasks are also not very good for such testing. it is too simple 
load. It would be nice if you could test the results with wide range of 
limits on Java Volano benchmark (loopback mode).
