Agreed.

Yup.  And it's not much of a race, the window is wide open.  One
malicious app simply has to do:
bind()
listen()
connect()
send() <-- Oops

Why not make a unix_seq_sendmsg, which is a very small wrapper?
e.g.
static int unix_seq_sendmsg(struct kiocb *kiocb, struct socket *sock,
			    struct msghdr *msg, size_t len)
{
	struct sock *sk = sock->sk;
	if (sk->sk_type == SOCK_SEQPACKET && sk->sk_state != TCP_ESTABLISHED)
		return -ENOTCONN;
	if (msg->msg_name || msg->msg_namelen)
		return -EINVAL;
	return unix_dgram_sendmsg(kiocb, sock, msg, len);
}
Also, I missed how MSG_EOR is honored.

Agreed, not connected, it should fail IMHO.

Does the above stop the other issue?  My laptop died, so I'm not able to
test ATM.
