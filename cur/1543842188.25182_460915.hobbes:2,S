Yay!  Can you give me a pointer to the patch?

Yes, I know.  I'm sometimes concerned at just how fast indirect jumps (and even
direct calls) are proliferating.  Look at the read syscall path for something
like ext3 these days: it's like a pile of spaghetti.  That seems particularly
true of direct-IO where it seems to weave in and out of core code and the
filesystem as it goes down.  I'm also concerned about stack usage.

I was told a while back (2002?) not to use indirect pointers for some stuff
because CPUs _couldn't_ predict it.  Maybe this has changed in modern CPUs.

Under some circumstances I can work out which sources have triggered which
interrupts (there are various off-CPU FPGAs which implement auxiliary PICs that
do announce their sources), but the aux-PIC channels are grouped together upon
delivery to the CPU PIC, so some of the ACK'ing has to be done at the group
level.

How is it possible with genirq?
Unless I tie all the grouped sources together into one virtual IRQ line, this
doesn't appear to be possible.  But doing that I might then also have a mixed
set of "flow" types in any particular IRQ.

The FRV CPU, like many others, supports interrupt prioritisation.  A particular
interrupt level is set in the PSR, and any interrupt of a higher priority can
interrupt.  do_IRQ() can then do the interrupt processing in the interrupt
level of the interrupt that invoked it, thus permitting higher priority
interrupts to still happen.

Not always; sometimes it has to fall back to polling the drivers unfortunately.
Btw why are we using IRQ_INPROGRESS, IRQ_DISABLED, IRQ_PENDING and friends?
They would appear unnecessary.
