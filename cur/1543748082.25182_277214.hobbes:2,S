hello,
I am writing a virtual network device driver in which
i am setting hard_header 22 instead 14. i have some
queries about it.
1) is that thing possible (hard_header=22)?
2) does virtual device driver can take eth0 control
and send modified packets?
3) i want to send extra info with packets by making
hard header 22 so is there any alignement problem?
any other solution/help is welcome.
regards,
cranium
