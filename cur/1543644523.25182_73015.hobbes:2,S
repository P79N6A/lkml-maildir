I hate big CC lists like this, but I don't know that everyone will see
this if I don't keep the CC list.  Sigh.

Excellent points, Ingo.  An alternative that I haven't seen considered
is the M:N threading model that NetBSD is adopting, called Scheduler
Activations.  The paper makes excellent reading.

One advantage of a SA-style system is that the kernel automatically and
very cleanly has a lot of information about the job as a single unit,
for purposes such as signal delivery, scheduling decisions, (and if it
came to that) paging/swapping.  The original Linus-dogma (as I
understood it -- I may well be misrepresenting things here) is that "a
thread is a process, and that's all there is to it".  This has a lovely
clarity, but it ignores the fact that there are times when it's
*important* that the kernel know that "these N threads belong to a
single job".  It appears that the NPTL work is creating a new
"collection-of-threads" object, which will fulfill the role I mention
above...  and this isn't a lot different from the end result of Nathan
Williams' SA work.
Another advantage of keeping a "process" concept is that things like CSA
(Compatible System Accounting, nee Cray System Accounting) need to add
some overhead to process startup/teardown.  If a "thread" can be created
without creating a new "process", this overhead is not needlessly
present at thread-startup time.
