Well yes.  But I don't think anybody is using it, and if so they are
clearly breaking the rules in man open(2):
       O_DIRECTORY
              If pathname is not a directory, cause the open  to  fail.   This
              flag is Linux‐specific, and was added in kernel version 2.1.126,
              to avoid denial‐of‐service problems if opendir(3) is called on a
              FIFO  or  tape  device,  but  should  not be used outside of the
              implementation of opendir.
So if someone uses this outside of opendir() and uses it to create a
non-directory, I think they deserve to be screwed.
