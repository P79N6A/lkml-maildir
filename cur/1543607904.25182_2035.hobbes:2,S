Anyone know if this is preempt safe?  It's using processor specific lists,
and might not be.
I tried integrating it into my latest kernel, and had some troubles with:
2.4.13freeswan-1.91+ac5+preempt+netdev_random+vm_freeswap
I'll admit, it was pretty ambitious trying to get it to work with -ac and
preempt at the same time....
When I get some time over the next few days, I'll give it a try with fewer
patches to reduce the interactions...
Oh, btw, the above kernel patch sets have compiled together, now it's just a
matter of rebooting and see if anything breaks. :)
Night guys,
Mike
