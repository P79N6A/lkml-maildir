i am trying to debug the linux kernel 2.6.10 using
kgdb.i have downloaded the kgdb patch 2.6.10-mm2.bz2.
after bunzip2 it gives me the file 2.6.10-mm2.
problem:
1- which type of file is this?
2- what patch command should i use(the options) so
that i can patch it to linux 2.6.10.?
3-i have used the following command and it gives me
some errors:
root@localhost root]# patch -p1 <2.6.10-mm2
can't find file to patch at input line 3
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
