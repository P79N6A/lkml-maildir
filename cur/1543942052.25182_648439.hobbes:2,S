Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: make traps on 'iret' be debuggable in user space
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/5/49

This makes the x86-64 behavior for 32-bit processes that set
bogus %cs/%ss values (the only ones that can fault in iret)
match what the native i386 behavior has been since:
