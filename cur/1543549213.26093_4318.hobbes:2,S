Hi,
while porting a serial multiport driver to sparc64 i disovered that the
function get_tty_baud_rate() only returns 50 or 75 Baud
for 57600 and 115200 which is *aehm* not what i expected.
Is this something i made wrong when setting up something or
is it another "Sparc[64] is different" issue ?
Flo
