as i've said before - i have the same problem too
the memory is OK! - have run memtest86 for hours ... - no errors ... -
heatsink - CPU@45°C - Case @ 25°C
after changing the kernel compile to PentiumII (nearly) everything worked
fine ....
2.4.6pre5 works as PentiumII but not as Athlon
2.4.5ac16 doesn't work at all - random oopses ......
