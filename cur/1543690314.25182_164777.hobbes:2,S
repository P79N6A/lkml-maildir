More complicated - when you move stuff you end up evicting another chunk
from the cache, you can't armwave that out of existance because you
yourself have created new eviction overhead for someone further down the
line.

Because programs normally pass data they've touched to other apps.
Your A/B example touches the data before sending even, but your
example on receive does not which is very atypical.

Its vital to include it in the measurement of all three. Without it
your measurements are meaningless. Look at it as an engineer. IPC 
involves writing to memory, making the data appear in the other task and
then reading it. You also want to measure things like throughput of your
IPC tasks running parallel to other processes doing stuff like pure
memory bandwidth tests so you can measure the impact you have on the
system although in this case thats probably less relevant by far
