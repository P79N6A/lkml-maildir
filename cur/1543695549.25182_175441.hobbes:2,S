I already have thought ahead about this issue. That is why one of the 
major changes to the framebuffer layer was to seperate the driver data 
into struct fb_info and a struct xxx_par. The idea was the data in struct 
fb_info was for the framebuffer layer and the data in struct xxx_par could 
be shared with other interfaces like DRI. The par idea can be extended 
further and we could use a common structure between a low level text mode
console driver and a graphics driver. For example mdacon and hgafb.
