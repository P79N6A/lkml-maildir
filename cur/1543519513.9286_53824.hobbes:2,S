Since the old RLIM_INFINITY is the preferred value for SPARC, shouldn't 
we change this back in the kernel, too (like on ALPHA) ? Or the value 
from the kernel header is different then the value from the glibc header 
file for SPARC.

Linux is like a Vorlon.  It is incredibly powerful, gives terse,
cryptic answers and has a lot of things going on in the background.
