Stop complaining.  We've known about this bug for over a month.  
It's even mentioned in the OSDL bugzilla:

 comment #2.  The only
question is why Dave hasn't fixed it yet...

I suggested back in October that the "reset" method should be renamed 
"init".  It only gets called once, during device initialization, so the 
"reset" name is a misnomer.  It should do an initialize _and_ a reset.

Nonsense.  It's done just as you described.  You just have to think of the 
reset method as an initialization method.
For now, you can workaround the bug by adding:
	spin_lock_init(&ehci_lock);
as the first line of drivers/usb/host/ehci-pci.c:ehci_pci_reset().
