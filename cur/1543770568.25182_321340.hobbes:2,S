Yes, it took some time to me to go working on this and getting the time to 
explain it clearly.

Well, that's a point, even because a conditional jump needs to flush the 
pipeline when mispredicted (which won't happen on other ARCHs after the 
initial period, if this jump stays in the Branch Target Buffers).

Christoph Hellwig too suggested this, however anything such *must* be longer 
term (while this was earlier pointed as a reason to drop this patch, last 
time).
Beyond that, I've not a clear understanding of S390, so I cannot for now help 
(including any merit discussion) on this point... Bodo Stroesser is porting 
UML on S390 so probably he might help more on this point.
