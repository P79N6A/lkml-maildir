I tried your patch on 2.4.4-ac8, and something strange happens.
Untarring linux-2.4.4 takes a little time, disk light flashes,
but no files appear on the disk (just 'Makefile', as you will see below).
Doing a separate gunzip - tar xf works fine:
werewolf:~/soft/kernel# gtar zxf linux-2.4.4.tar.gz
werewolf:~/soft/kernel# ls linux-2.4.4
Makefile
werewolf:~/soft/kernel# sync
werewolf:~/soft/kernel# ls linux-2.4.4
Makefile
werewolf:~/soft/kernel# gunzip linux-2.4.4.tar.gz
werewolf:~/soft/kernel# tar xf linux-2.4.4.tar
werewolf:~/soft/kernel# ls linux-2.4.4

Some buffers get not flushed ???
If they can interact with yours, I have also applied the patches for
- cache-align from Andrea (I suppose it has nothing to do with yours)
- context-switches reduction by Mike Galbraith (perhaps ?)
and a silly couple more (CC:=$(CC) in Makefile, missing return in aic7xxx).
