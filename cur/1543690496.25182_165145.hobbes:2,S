No the GPL_ONLY stuff is an attempt to document that there is no conceivable
way that using a given symbol does not create a derived work.  
If you use an unmodified kernel it is only a one liner to ensure it does
not complain about your code.  So this only shows up as a real
impediment when code that uses the symbol is distributed.
Beyond which copying code into the kernel is when this is checked so this is
a valid place to check things.  There is a strong tying between using
programs and copying them into memory.  And that copying is the
justification for most usage restrictions even in commercial software.
The code is also quite a small nit that really should not affect
anything.
