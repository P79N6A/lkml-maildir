Novell is assigned block 60-70 by some committee way back in the mid-1980's.
51 is not legal for them, I would like to look at this one.   Any numbers in
range 60-70 they can and do use, though most are experimental.  66 and 64
are no longer used, but older stuff may use them.
77 is one we are using internally for M2FS/M2CS partitions.  VNDI can be
dropped.
