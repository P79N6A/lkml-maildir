Hi there,
I've had some strange problems with autoloading of some modules in the
latest versions of the kernel (up to test12-pre4). I'm using devfs and
modutils 2.3.21. Most of the modules autoload fine however ppp_async and
parport_pc don't autoload anymore. /etc/modules.conf has the following
aliases:
alias char-major-108 ppp_generic
alias tty-ldisc-3    ppp_async
alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc
Everything worked fine with that setup until 2.4.0-test8. If I insmod the
modules by hand things continue to run smoothly.
Is there an obvious problem that I have missed? Does anybody else have
these problems? Can anybody help me?
Thanks a lot in advance... Felix
PS: please cc me directly
