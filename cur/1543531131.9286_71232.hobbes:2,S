   No. On Un*x systems there is a fixed limit to the number of processes.
On linux you run out at 512 or so if you don't modify the source. But
anyway, the daemon itself only needs to keep the configuration data around.
Once the daemon has started up, it will only need to allocate memory to
load new configuration data. If it mmap()s the config file, it doesn't even
need to do that.
