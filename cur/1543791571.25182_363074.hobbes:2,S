This was deliberate.  CR4 doesn't exist on standard 486 class systems, 
and I'm not sure how you could make use of it anyway, since the features 
used by Linux - machine check, page size extensions, time stamp counter, 
global pages, are only available in Pentium and later class systems, and 
identified by CPUID, which also doesn't exist on 486.
There may be some funky Cyrix or even Intel CPUs that have CR4 
registers, but showing the output in a register dump seems very 
useless.  I would also not recommend using undocumented features in CR4 
even if you have such a freaky processor - there were bugs and/or 
missing functionality with the early large page and global page 
extensions that were not ironed out until the features became 
documented, IIRC.  YMMV - please let me know if anyone has found ways to 
make this useful.
If I am wrong, I am happy to correct this, but I would like to do so 
properly by adding safe_read_cr4() or equivalent rather than using raw 
inlines assembler to catch the fault.
Thanks,
Zach
