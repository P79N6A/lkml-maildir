Yes it does. Actually, all it does is allow kstopmachine to call yield
without the bug message.  I looked into the logic of kstopmachine, and
it is perfectly fine to call yield there. So I added a rt_yield function
to allow for places that it is OK for a RT task to call yield without
showing that message.
I found my patch here: (It's a -p0 patch)
