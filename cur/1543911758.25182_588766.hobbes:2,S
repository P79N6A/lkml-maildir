The MMC layer can handle all MMC and SD cards, but it does not support
all known controllers as most vendors refuse to release any specs.
Unfortunately, that is the case here. Ricoh has several controller
interfaces, and currently we only support one of them (the public
standard sdhci interface).
So until Ricoh changes their policy or someone reverse engineers their
interface, then I'm afraid you're out of luck.
