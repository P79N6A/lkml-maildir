   This is only worth it if most packets will have the same sized header.
   Networking guys: is this a valid assumption?
Not really... one retransmit and the TCP header size grows
due to the SACK options.
I find it truly bletcherous what you're trying to do here.
Why not instead find out if it's possible to have the e1000
fetch the entire cache line where the first byte of the packet
resides?  Even ancient designes like SunHME do that.
