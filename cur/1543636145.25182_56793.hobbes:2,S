And path_to_inst does not always do the RightThing(tm). [1] [2] Two
systems identically configured has the potential of having path_to_inst
look different. Especially if you have previously installed a device or
moved stuff around. And if the expectation is that a group of devices will
come up in a certain sequence (think shared tape devices for instance) and
it changes, it quickly becomes a nightmare. Not a fun proposition by any
means.
