Subject: Possible breakage in 2.6.16?

Greetings;
Always curious as to what sort of information can be extracted from the 
tools linux gives us, I've discovered that netstat, from the
net-tools-1.60-25.1 rpm
no longer functions for anything as even a 'netstat --version' takes the 
curser to the upper left corner of the screen and hangs till ctl+c'd.
The only evidence of its execution is a steady, about 2 per second, 
increase in the number of processes running as reported by gkrellm, all 
of which go away when I ctl+c netstat itself.
I'm running 2.6.16 self configured here.
Is this a known problem because my net-tools rpm is old?  Or because  
2.6.16 broke it?
