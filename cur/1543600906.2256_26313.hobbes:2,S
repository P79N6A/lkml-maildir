One question is still open on this case:
Why does the Oops only occur if the "aic7xxx=verbose" is set ?
The above explanation is correct (AFAIK), but the kernel-oops should
then happen on *every* reboot, not only if this verbose-parameter is
set...or does the driver try to shutdown the drives and then write to
the log "AIC7xxx shutdown successfull"...?...:-))
Solong...
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
