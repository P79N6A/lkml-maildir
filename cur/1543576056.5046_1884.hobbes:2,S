Notes:
(1) Persistent data is not on by default, you must run insmod with -e
    to support persistent data.  If you are loading modules via
    modprobe and you want persistent data for all modules then you need
      insmod_opt -e ""
    in /etc/modules.conf.
(2) Current kernels do not support persistent data nor generic strings.
    You must apply patch-2.4.0-test13-pre2 to get kernel support for
    these features.
(3) No modules currently have persistent data.  Module writers who
    want data to be persistent must make a one character change to
    their modules, read the above patch.  Even then, the user must
    activate the persistent data, see note (1).
