 I have a tree (I am not near that computer) which has irda driver
missing. Apparently my patch doesn't create directories automatically
or I missed an option. Anyway this could be the problem - and the cure is
to download the complete tarball.

PS - for anyone who is interested my system is Slackware - and I found
several utilities (like sed) being old enough so that new gnu stuff (like
configure) doesn't work well. patch can be another one. On the other hand
I think I upgraded it along with everything else.
