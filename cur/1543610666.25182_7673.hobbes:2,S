i know this is an old thread now, but i thought of something that might
be a nice feature, though it means more work for kernel maintainers.
a bug patch seperate from the new kernel patch. so you could only
upgrade from 2.4.0 with the bug fixes in 2.4.1. by the time you're at
something like 2.4.15, 2.4.0 should be rock solid. but you wouldn't have
any new funcionality.
say you wanted the new VM. you could upgrade to the first kernel with
the new VM, then get the bug patch for the latest kernel.
not a simple straigt forward idea, and it could mean a lot of work.
though maybe it is easier than i realize, or a few orders of magnitude
harder than i realize, and thus not worth it.
i've noticed that the 'aa' patch series seems to be something along
these lines.
