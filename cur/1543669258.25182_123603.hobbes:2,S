CONFIG_SERIO=y
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y
Is your keyboard PS/2 or PC-AT-like, or something else?

Interesting.  If I force that register IRQ 12 to fail, I just get this
one time:
i8042.c: Can't get irq 12 for AUX, unregistering the port.
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Just saw Andrew's email...
