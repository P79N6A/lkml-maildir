but a part of the problem remains: i can't get a succesful connection
the calling side gets a CONNECT message, but on the called side i only 
get the RING
and after some seconds on both lines NO CARRIER
syslog only shows the RING and no connect
the same when i'm calling from gsm phone
btw, when calling from mobile phone i have to leave S19=197 (with 2.2.17 
S19=0 is working as described in the isdn faq, has this changed now?)
