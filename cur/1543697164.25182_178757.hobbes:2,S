Well, traditional (== scheduler) solution is not to have idle classes
and not guarantee anything about realtime classes.
At least idle class can not be used to hold important semaphore
forever (even low-priority prosses receive enough time not to hold
important semaphores too long)... I believe you should do the same (==
get rid of idle class for now, and clearly state that realtime ones
are not _guaranteed_ anything).
