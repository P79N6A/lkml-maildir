It would be great to get some testing on another architecture.
I don't have an architecture independant way to build SMT scheduling
descriptions, although with the cpu_sibling_map change, you can copy
and paste the code for the P4 if you are able to build a cpu_sibling_map.
I'll just have to add a some bits so SMT and NUMA work together which
I will be unable to test. I'll get back to you with some code.
