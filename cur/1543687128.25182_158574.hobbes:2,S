No.  It would be fairly messy to implement in 2.4 because 2.4 does not have
the per-inode radix trees for pagecache.  The implementation would need to
walk every page attached to the inode just to shoot down a single page. 
And all of it underneath the global pagecache lock.
But it is certainly possible.
