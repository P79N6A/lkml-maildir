Now I understand your objection!  Yes, I would agree that it does need
settling a bit.  In particular, we are getting ready to ditch the
netlink I/F in favour of PF_KEYv2 sockets instead, which are portable,
whereas netlink sockets only exist on Linux, IIRC.  We are at the
point where all keying information is using the new I/F, but policy
information is still using netlink.  I hope to have this complete in
the next two weeks.  After that, only the debug switches need to be
converted and I am still uncertain whether to use sysctl or
non-standard PF_KEYv2 extensions.  The fact that sysctl is being
streamlined like /proc has recently been makes it more attractive, but
then, they are not portable, but neither are non-standard PF_KEYv2
extensions either...

No, I haven't, because it is stable, but that is *supposed* to be the
nature of 2.[0246].xx kernels.  The 2.[1357] kernels are supposed to
be development kernels, so that type of thing would be appropriate
there.
