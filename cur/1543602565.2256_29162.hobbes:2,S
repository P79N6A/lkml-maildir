yes. the above will still be printed, because there is no newline in the
printk. The first printk (which is very likely <0>), will be interpreted
as KERN_EMERG and will be snipped, the rest of the 'line' will be printed.
(until something printk's a \n, when the whole thing starts again.) But
you are right, it's more consistent and safer to use eg. "(%d)".
