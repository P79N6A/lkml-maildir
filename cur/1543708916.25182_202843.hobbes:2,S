Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.25: Get rid of obsolete LMC driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Marcello,
This patch plus an additional
rm -r drivers/net/wan/lmc
gets rid of the obsolete LMC WAN driver and all references to it in the
Configure.in and Makefiles and MAINTAINERS.
When LMC was taken over by SBE their kernel version of the driver went
effectively unmaintained after Alan Cox turned down their LMC->SBE
rename patch. Today SBE recommends their own version of the driver only
which unfortunately needs different tools and also clashes with the LMC
driver when not compiled as module. This general recommendation from
their support effectively makes the in-kernel code obsete.
Their drivers can be retrieved from:
ftp://ftp.sbei.com/pub/OpenSource/Linux/sbe_driver/sbe_linux-4.0a.tgz
-- 
Servus,
       Daniel

-CONFIG_LANMEDIA
-  This is a driver for the following Lan Media family of serial
-  boards.
-
-  LMC 1000 board allows you to connect synchronous serial devices (for
-  example base-band modems, or any other device with the X.21, V.24,
-  V.35 or V.36 interface) to your Linux box.
-
-  LMC 1200 with on board DSU board allows you to connect your Linux
-  box directly to a T1 or E1 circuit.
-
-  LMC 5200 board provides a HSSI interface capable of running up to
-  52 mbits per second.
-
-  LMC 5245 board connects directly to a T3 circuit saving the
-  additional external hardware.
-
-  To change setting such as syncPPP vs cisco HDLC or clock source you
-  will need lmcctl.  It is available at <
ftp://ftp.lanmedia.com/>.
-
-  This code is also available as a module called lmc.o ( = code
-  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
-  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
-  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
