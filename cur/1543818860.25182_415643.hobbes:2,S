It's simple. Here's what you do :
1. Read Documentation/SubmittingPatches, especially the "Developer's
Certificate of Origin 1.1" bit.
2. Make sure you agree/comply with above mentioned Developer's cert.,
then add a line like this just above your patch:
Signed-off-by: Tim Phipps <tim@phipps-hutton.freeserve.co.uk>
(ohh and please submit patches inline in emails if at all possible,
not as attachments, thanks)  :-)
