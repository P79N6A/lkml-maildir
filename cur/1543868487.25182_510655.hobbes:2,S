Ugly, but I can't think of a better way to do it, either.

This confused me at first reading.  If it's inserted, then insert it.
Perhaps KIF_COMPLETED would be a better name?

I think that we would ideally cancel the I/Os in flight since we are
going to throw away the results.  However, we don't exactly support
cancellation today.  So, I have no objection to this less optimal
solution.
