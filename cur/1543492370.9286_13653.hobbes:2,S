Pushing it into swap is not sufficient: to trigger the swap cache you
need to be actively using data which has previously been swapped out,
which requires dirtying the pages, swapping them out and then touching
them again for read access.  In that special case, when the
newly-swapped-back-in page still matches the copy on disk, the swap
cache mechanism keeps both the in-memory and on-disk copies linked to
each other.

Don't forget that you can use the "mem=*m" option at boot time to run
in a reduced memory configuration.  That might make it a bit easier
for you to trigger this stuff. :)
