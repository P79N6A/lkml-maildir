What do you mean by "wrong"?  What combinations of types do you think
should be disallowed here?  put_user(char, int*), for example, or what?
We had one instance recently where code was doing put_user() of an
eight-byte struct and that sailed through x86 testing but made the sparc64
compiler ICE.  Certainly we should stamp out tricks like that at compile
time, but how far should we go?
There's probably a good case for ensuring that typeof(x)==typeof(*ptr), but
I suspect that'd create a lot of noise.

Sounds sane.  We could make it warn if typeof(x)!=typeof(*ptr) by adding
another temporary for the pointer, give it type typeof(x)*, but I haven't
tried it.
