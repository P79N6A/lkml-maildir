No, but it's better than what it used to be.
Also, while I don't think we should try to maintain 1:1 behaviour with 
the _worst_ offenses of zlib, I do think we should maintain comments etc, 
and a lot of the zlib function declarations used to look like
	int foo(bar, baz)
	long bar;		/* number of frobnicators */
	long baz;		/* self-larting on or off */
	{
		....
and the ANSI-fication changes this to
	int foo(
		long bar,	/* number of frobnicators */
		long baz	/* self-larting on or off */
	)
	{
		...
which while not according to the coding-standard is at least a reasonable 
compromize between having proper C function definitions and keeping the 
code _looking_ more like the original.
