Ok, I see. You don't use PS/2 mouse and so BIOS told us that mouse is
absent and reassigned IRQ12 to EHCI controller. However we do not
listen to BIOS on i386 (for historucal reasons) and process with
registering AUX port... Now IRQ12 is shared between AUX port and EHCI
and the keyboard controller is unhappy wehereas before (with polling
timer) it would release IRQ12 and close port...
Does your keyboard start working if you boot with i8042.noaux?
