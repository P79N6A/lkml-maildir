Why the hell do you keep saying that?
There *are* lawyers who have said that what Tivo did was legal. They were 
the FSF's own lawyers. So now you're saying "I am not a lawyer, but that's 
not right".
So you're trying to state some legal point, admitting that you're not a 
lawyer, and admitting that actual real-life lawyers disagree with you?
So please explain why the *hell* you would expect us to take your points 
seriously?
