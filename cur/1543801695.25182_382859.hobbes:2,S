Subject: 2.6.15-git2: CONFIGFS_FS shows up as M/y choice, help says "if unsure, say N"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

===========
Userspace-driven configuration filesystem (EXPERIMENTAL) (CONFIGFS_FS)
[M/y/?] (NEW)
Both sysfs and configfs can and should exist together on the
same system. One is not a replacement for the other.
If unsure, say N.
===========
I think I'll say M - for now ;)
