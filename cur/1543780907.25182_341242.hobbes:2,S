Yes. The FR451 CPU (the only one with an MMU at the moment) has accounting and
profiling aids that are enabled by the context number set in the CXNR
register. This context number also selectively enables TLB entries on a per-mm
context basis.
So to profile a process you pin a context number to that process, and then the
profiling h/w is only active for that process.
