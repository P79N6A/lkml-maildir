Erm...
"ECC" means there are extra bits that, with small amount of errors,
allow to recalculate the initial value.
If you're getting error messages with ECC errors, that means that your
RAM really looses its contents. You should fix your machine. (Check
that eg. timings are correct with RAM's specification, ...)
You're on risk. Really.
