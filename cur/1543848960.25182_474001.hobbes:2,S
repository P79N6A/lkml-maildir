Hotplug is not high on my priority list.
I do what I can in my spare time to avoid having cpusets or hotplug
break each other.
Besides, I'm not sure I'd be able.  I've gotten to the point where I am
confident I can make simple changes at the edges, such as mimicing the
sched domain side affects of the cpu_exclusive flag with my new
sched_domain flag.  But that's near the current limit of my sched domain
writing skills.
