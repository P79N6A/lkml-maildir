If one cpu stores, does it get picked up in the other cpu's I-cache?
If not, you cannot use the lazy dcache flushing method, and in fact
you must broadcast the flush on all processors.

Strange.

You have to do the flush on the processor that does the store,
at a minimum.  But if other cpus have no way to "notice" stores
on other cpus in their I-cache, this alone is not sufficient.
Based upon your report, I strongly suspect that remote I-caches
do not see cpu local stores when the cache is in write allocate
mode.  If this is true, it's a horrible design decision for an
SMP system :(

Ptrace can make this occur, but that's obviously not what you're
seeing here.
