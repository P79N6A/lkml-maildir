It already does (netlink_destroy_callback), but that doesn't help
with this race though since without this patch we don't enter the
error path.

The problem is asynchronous processing of the dump request in the
context of a different process. Process requests a dump, message
is queued and process returns from sendmsg since some other process
is already processing the queue. Then the process closes the socket,
resulting in netlink_release being called. When the dump request
is finally processed the race Pavel described might happen. This
can only happen for netlink families that use mutex_try_lock for
queue processing of course.
