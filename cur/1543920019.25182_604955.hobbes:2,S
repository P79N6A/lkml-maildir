Well if it is compiled in, it is not a module, so you cannot find it
the usual way.

That does not work reliably either. There might be PCI devices
which have the same PID:VID, but need a readb() or so for further
finding out whether the actual piece of hardware has a driver.
And then there is that sort of modules which do not have typical IDs
(i.e. udev cannot/won't autoload them) at all, like pcspkr.ko/psmouse.ko
