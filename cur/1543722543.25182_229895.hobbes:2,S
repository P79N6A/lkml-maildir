Hi,
First of I have no idea what khelper actually does, but it seems to make
a problem on my box.
I have a Debian/unstable box here (the same one that has these "fast
clock problems with 2.6.7-mm1) and every night after the syslog restart
the process with the id "4", which is khelper is reported to be
respawning to fast.
Now is this a kernel issue, or more a issue of my system and some jobs
that might disrupt this?
