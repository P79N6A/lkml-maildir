I am trying to get an up-to-date stable kernel (2.2.18pre19, with
PowerPC changes, downloaded from the PowerPC BitKeeper archive)
compiled with the international patch (patch-int-2.2.17-9 which is the 
latest in the crypto/ directory).  The patch applies fine (with some
offsets, but all hunks succeed) but when linking vmlinux, I get the
following: 
ld -T arch/ppc/vmlinux.lds -Ttext 0xc0000000 -Bstatic
arch/ppc/kernel/head.o init/main.o init/version.o \
        --start-group \

This happened somewhere between 2.2.18pre3 (which compiles
successfully with the 2.2.17 crypto patch) and vanilla (from
people/alan) pre9, which fails with the same error as above.
I'm guessing something changed in the conventions for subsystem
initialization.  If someone can give me a quick summary of what to
change, I'll try to fix it.  Otherwise I'll grovel through the
2.2.18pre patches and try to figure out what to do myself, but I'm not 
looking forward to that option...
Thanks in advance,
Doug
