Hi,
I think nobody objects seeing the interface implemented. Maybe just how 
it's implemented. I did not have a close look, but the concept seems 
odd at first sight.
Using a individial timer as interrupt source may be a different idea 
(if avaliable for the particular hardware), but the there must be a 
balance between busy looping in the kernel and setting up of such an 
individual interrupt.
The other thing is how to correlate it with the wall clock.
Sorry for not giving answers, I just know the problems...
Regards,
Ulrich
