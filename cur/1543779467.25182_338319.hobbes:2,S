Good idea, at least to avoid changing all arches at this moment;
though I don't think handle_mm_fault itself can be static inline.
But let's set this VM_FAULT_RACE approach aside for now: I think
we're agreed that the pte_dirty-with-mods-to-s390 route is more
attractive, so I'll now try to find fault with that approach.
