Yes, that would be the worst-case slowdown in the hot-cache case.  
Rearranging the layout of the GDT would remove any theoretical 
cold-cache slowdown (I haven't measured if there's any impact in practice).

That would be nice, but this patch series isn't really intended to be a 
performance improvement.  That would be nice, but the main motivation is 
to make inline assembler patching for the paravirt work cleaner.
Rusty and I have also been investigating how to use the %gs-based memory 
to implement all percpu data, rather than the few special cases this 
patch series currently covers, which will help further amortize the 
entry/exit cost.
Rusty has also done more comprehensive benchmarks with his variant of 
this patch series, and found no statistically interesting performance 
difference.  Which is pretty much what I would expect, since it doesn't 
increase cache-misses at all.
