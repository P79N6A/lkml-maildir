If anyone should be sorry it should be you for taking
me off the list in the first place. Why are you
removing users every time a message bounces? That's
extremely abnormal. I am part of a lot of lists and I
have never seen anyone delete people based on a
trivial number of bounces. Especially on a list that
has as uch spam as this list does. 
I bounce some messages - so what? 
The problem is that if this list kicks people off
wrongly them the fault is with the list configuration.
What you should be doing is fixing the list and not
kicking people off the list.
