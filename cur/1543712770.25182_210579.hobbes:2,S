Well, like I said, the BK trees (both Linus' linux-2.5 and David's 
to-linus-2.5) continue to work, all the way up through today, and 
2.6.5-rc1-mm1 worked too.

It looks like there's a bug in the sysrq implementation in the sn_serial 
driver.  Once the initial console is opened, sysrq no longer works.  All I've 
determined so far is that both CPUs in my box are in cpu_idle somewhere...  
Anyway, I'll keep looking.
Thanks,
Jesse
