This fancy new BDI stuff also lives off percpu_counter/alloc_percpu().
That means that for example each NFS mount also consumes a number of
words - not quite sure from the top of my head how many, might be in the
order of 24 bytes or something.
I once before started looking at this, because the current
alloc_percpu() can have some false sharing - not that I have machines
that are overly bothered by that. I like the idea of a strict percpu
region, however do be aware of the users.
