Here my 2Rp. against 2.3.51:
It builds and boots on a PPC 601 (PM7200) and on a PPC750(Wallstreet I
). Not much testing, but an afternoon working. One thing DON'T work, the
PCMCIA stuff. I had to step back to the package itself, then I get the
simple serial pieces to work, with patching, I expect the ethernets too
if I could test them... But the CardBus (32-bit) don't work on both,
kernel & pkg.
