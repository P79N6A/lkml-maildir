That patch still gets several cases wrong: we don't update any counters at
all for the case where we were TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and we got made
TASK_RUNNING because of having a signal pending.
Also, we shouldn't update the context switch counter just because we 
entered the scheduler. If we don't actually end up switching to anything 
else, it shouldn't count as a context switch.
So how about something like this?
Totally untested. Comments?
