Quite, but that is sometimes an admissible state of affairs.
One of the things that was infuriating when we were trying to do shared
databases over the page cache was that someone would start some
unsynchronised process that had nothing to do with the database itself
(it would typically be a process that was backing up the rest of the
disk or something like that). Said process would end up pinning pages in
memory, and prevented the database itself from getting updated data from
the server.
IOW: the problem was not that of unsynchronised I/O per se. It was
rather that of allowing the application to set up its own
synchronisation barriers and to ensure that no pages are cached across
these barriers. POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE can't offer that guarantee.

Writes are not the real problem here since shared databases typically do
implement sufficient synchronisation, and NFS can guarantee that only
the dirty data will be written out. However reading back the data is
problematic when you have insufficient control over the page cache.
The other issue is, of course, that databases don't _want_ to cache the
data in this situation, so the extra copy to the page cache is just a
bother. As you pointed out, that becomes less of an issue as processor
caches and memory speeds increase, but it is still apparently a
measurable effect.
