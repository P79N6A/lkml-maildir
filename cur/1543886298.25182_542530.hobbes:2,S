These warnings are showed by scripts/mod/modposts.c. 
It checks section mismatch stricter than before.
Some of them are not defined as __init even if it's called at just
boottime. This is simple to fix.
Second case is that the functions judge which functions
should call (boottime or normal) by themselves.
pte_alloc_one_kernel() looks its case.
In this case, they must be registered in whitelist of modpost.c
Other possibility is they are just rare called functions.
It should be investigated....
Bye.
