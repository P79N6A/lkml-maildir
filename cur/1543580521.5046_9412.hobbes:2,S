Don't blame us when the driver gets an oops.  name_to_kdev_t is defined
__init so the code is discarded after boot and the area is reused as
scratch space.  You must not EXPORT_SYMBOL() any __init or __exit code.
The only place name_to_kdev_t is used in md is in the md_setup routine,
that routine probably only makes sense when md is built in, not when md
is a module.  I recommend wrapping md_setup and all its data in #ifndef
MODULE.
