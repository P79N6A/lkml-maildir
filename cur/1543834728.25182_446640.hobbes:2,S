I disagree.
I find it quite nice to be able to see that the driver loaded even if
it finds nothing. At least then when there's a problem, I can quickly
see that at least it is not because I didn't forget to load the
driver, it's something else. Saves time since I can start looking for
reasons why the driver didn't find anything without first spending
additional time checking if I failed to cause it to load for some
reason.
