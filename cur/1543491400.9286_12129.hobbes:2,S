"Hi there!" he said enthusiastically. "I havn't been around much
lately because my Linux-based systems just won't crash."
It has come to my attention that there has recently been a discussion
about the GNU/Linux vs. Linux issue in which an essay I wrote some
time ago has been used. Unfortunately, it was quoted slightly out of
context so I feel it's time for me to explain myself.
These discussions have no place on this list however, so I suggest that
all further communication is done via personal email.
In my essay I write; "To help everyone understand this, I have made
it a habit of calling my system a Linux-based GNU-system, in short a
GNU/Linux system. [...] By calling it a GNU/Linux system I give credit
to every program which are part of--or has been adopted by--the GNU
project."
I would ask that you pay attention to the 'I'. This is how -I- look at
it. You might look at it in another way. In fact, you might even take
the same argument and turn it around, thus enabling you to call your
system a "Linux" system. There are nothing "right" and nothing "wrong"
in a discussion like this because it all depends on how you look at
the matters at hand.
I also write; "The specific name is not really important, though some
people might want to think so. The importance is to give credit to the
GNU project where credit is due. One way to do so is by calling the
system a GNU/Linux system, but there are many more ways to do it and
only your imagination will limit them."
Thats the core of my essay regarding the GNU/Linux vs Linux debate.
When the FSF tells people to use the name GNU/Linux instead of "Linux",
that is a suggestion, not a "MUST". Someone suggested to me that crediting
GNU in the system bootup messages or in the motd would be a good idea, and
that's perhaps something to think about.
I will continue to call my system a "GNU/Linux" system because thats the
best way I can think of to credit the GNU Project. If you have found a
better way, or a way that better fits you, I suggest you persue that
course of action. Noone would be happier than me if we could stop this
bickering between ourselves.
If we're going to take over the world, we've got a lot of software to
write and this discussion is taking too much time away from more important
matters like "How should bug foobar be fixed?", "Could we add foo in the
bar driver?" and "foodp".
Happy hacking!
Jonas
