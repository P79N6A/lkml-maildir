Hello,
First I would like to ask people not to post such patches to lkml but 
rather to the LVS list, because this affects only LVS so far and we 
cover all kernel versions pretty much up to date. Julian just needs to 
do the s/__constant_htons/htons/ fixes and upload the changes to his site ;)
The inclusion of the hidden feature has been discussed almost to death 
on netdev (where these questions should have gone in the first place) 
and it was decided against inclusion of this patch for various reasons.

Yes. What is the problem? You need to setup the x-hundred webservers 
anyway, 2 routing entry lines certainly won't hurt. Yes, I understand 
that if you're in process of upgrading your webservers from 2.2.x to 
2.4.x this is a bit of an additional pain. There are also other 
solutions to this arp problem, but please address this on the LVS 
mailinglist.

Depends if it was a hack before that shouldn't have been there in the 
first place. In an evolutionary process things get optimized ... as has 
happened with the network stack code.

Search the LVS and the netdev archives for constructive discussions 
about it. No need to flame anyone. But hey, if people keep coming up 
with this, DaveM and Alexey might get weak and put it back in 2.5.x :)
Best regards,
