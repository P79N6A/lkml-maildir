Suresh -
This popped up in Ingo's x86 tree yesterday. This appears to be breaking
on our simulator running in x2apic mode. If I understand the code,
this is a real breakage and not a problem in our simulator:
arch/x86/include/asm/genapic.h
	static inline unsigned int read_apic_id(void)
	{
        	unsigned int reg;
        	reg = *(u32 *)(APIC_BASE + APIC_ID);
        	return apic->get_apic_id(reg);
	}
As expected, the failure occurs right after:
	Enabling x2apic
	Enabled x2apic and interrupt-remapping
The next reference to apicid tries to read from mem instead of MSRs.
