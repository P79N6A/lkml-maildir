Hi!
Since I have upgraded my hardware to an Abit BP6 with dual Celeron 533 with
Linux 2.2.16 I am experiencing complete system lockups from time to time,
often when I use Moneydance/JRE 1.2.2.
How can I start debugging this? I have once heard there is a patch that
prevents complete lookups using NMI interrupts - where can I get it?
Tom
