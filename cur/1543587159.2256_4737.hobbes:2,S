-IP6 tables support (required for filtering/masq/NAT)
-CONFIG_IP6_NF_IPTABLES
-  ip6tables is a general, extensible packet identification framework.
-  Currently only the packet filtering and packet mangling subsystem
-  for IPv6 use this, but connection tracking is going to follow.
-  Say 'Y' or 'M' here if you want to use either of those.

-IPv6 limit match support
-CONFIG_IP6_NF_MATCH_LIMIT
-  limit matching allows you to control the rate at which a rule can be
-  matched: mainly useful in combination with the LOG target ("LOG
-  target support", below) and to avoid some Denial of Service attacks.
