Subject: [PATCH 2.4.20-rc4] 2.4.19 / 2.4.20 Pauses/stopps with high disk I/O

Hi Con, Andrea, Jens,
Con and me were testing your, Andrea, lowlatency elevator hack the last days. 
It's much impressive that I/O pauses/stopps are almost gone with the hack, 
even though the throughput is decreased (22mb/s to 12mb/s for my mashine).
Con did a 3 line change to drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c and 
include/linux/elevator.h and those pauses/stopps are _totally_ gone. Even 
throughput increased from 12mb/s, with the lowlat elevator from Andrea, to 
14mb/s with that 3 liner. Patch attached + Config option for 2.4.20-rc4.
Exchanging the files mentioned above with the 2.4.18 ones has either no effect 
to throughput (22mb/s) and also has no pauses/stopps.
We think the approach with the lowlatency elevator's is fine, but there must 
have changed something very seriously in the mentioned files that this occur 
with >= 2.4.19.
This is just a "we want to inform you about it" mail :)
Have fun!
ciao, Marc

+  If you are building your kernel for desktop usage it is highly
