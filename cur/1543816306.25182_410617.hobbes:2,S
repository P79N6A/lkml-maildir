I disagree with you. Right now we can have sysctl and proc for init 
namespaces only.
And when sysctl and proc are virtualized somehow, we can fix all these.
I simply don't expect /proc and sysctl to be done quickly. As we have 
very different approaches. And there is no any consensus. Why not to 
commit working/agreed parts then?

I also don't see why it can be separated. There is an API in namespaces, 
and how it is mapped into syscalls is another question. At least it 
doesn't prevent us from commiting virtualization itself, agree?
Thanks,
Kirill
