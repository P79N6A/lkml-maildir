Makes indeed more sense.

Maybe, maybe not. I followed the comment in the original code, saying 
that we need word-wise access for I/O memory poking. Can I assume across 
a all archs that __copy_to/from_user will not perform byte accesses if 
count is 2, 4, or 8? I would be glad if we can kill other couple of line.
Ingo, if you are close to an editor, please pick those up? Here are some 
offline things cooking on my side...
