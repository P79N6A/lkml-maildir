Boy I hope that's a typo... I hope you meant both devices on a cable and
not really both cables on a controller.
And as for more than one device on a cable, I wouldn't expect hot swap to
work, but sure I have have a ZIP drive on a cable with a 2nd CD-ROM drive,
I use ZIP about as often as my cat farts Channel No5, I don't tie up a
cable for something which may go a year between uses. Don't use the
standby 16x CD more than a few times a year, either.
The removable drive I did get working was on its own old controller. And
it worked fine, I copied a fair number of old 420MB drives to CD after
they came out of machines which might have had something useful. Just in
case I ever think of something worth a treasure hunt. The drives were
wiped and used for a software RAID proof of concept project.
