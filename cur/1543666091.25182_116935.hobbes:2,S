Subject: CRC errors decompressing kernel on boot

Hello,
I am getting a CRC error when the kernel is being decompressed after
loading.  It is intermitent, but I can force it to occur on every boot
if I type on the keyboard while the kernel is loaded (before being 
decompressed). 
It happens on a certain machine, with USB keyboard.
It does *not* happen with a PS2 keyboard.
It does not happen on other machines with USB or PS2 keyboards.
I would say this is a hardware problem, as I see it happen only on a certain
type of machine.  It is custom built by a manufacturer in Spain, with:
# lspci
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 82845G/GL [Brookdale-G] Chipset Host Bridge (rev 01)
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corp. 82845G/GL [Brookdale-G] Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)
00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB USB (Hub #1) (rev 01)
00:1d.1 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB USB (Hub #2) (rev 01)
00:1d.2 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB USB (Hub #3) (rev 01)
00:1d.7 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB USB EHCI Controller (rev 01)
00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 82801BA/CA/DB PCI Bridge (rev 81)
00:1f.0 ISA bridge: Intel Corp. 82801DB ISA Bridge (LPC) (rev 01)
00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82801DB ICH4 IDE (rev 01)
The keyboard is USB.  Lilo is 22.4.
Problem happens both with 2.4.20-ac2 and 2.4.21-pre5-ac2
kernels are compiled with gcc (GCC) 3.2.3 20030221 (Debian prerelease)
and I saw no problems during compilation.
All i really need to know is whether it is a Linux problem, a Lilo problem
or a hardware problem.   Any help I can get will be helpful.
I searched the kernel list archives but found nothing similar to this
problem.
Thank you,
