I don't think that the ACPI can / is interfacing with my bios properly. 
On every "event", like closing the laptop for example, generates
"ecgpe-0131 [05] ec_gpe_handler        : Unable to send 'query command'
to EC"
Does this mean i should just stick with APM?  Is there something i can
do to help figure out how to make it work?
thanks,
Brenden
