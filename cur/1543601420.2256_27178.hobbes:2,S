what other design solution do you propose rather both inodes sharing the
i_mapping across the different inodes like I did?
I found more handy to just bump the i_count of the first inode and
referencing it from the bd_inode, rather than dynamically allocating the
i_mapping and have a bd_mapping, but if you prefer to dynamically
allocate the i_mapping rather than using the i_data of the fist inode we
can change that of course. Not sure what's the mess in the patch you're
talking about, could you elaborate?
