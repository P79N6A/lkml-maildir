i was wondering if anyone had seen this error when employing the BusLogic BT-958 PCI
SCSI using driver version 2.0.14, the disk is an IBM Ultra Star 18XP ( non-SCA ), and
the kernel is 2.0.35. 
the error text is:
17:37:08 master kernel: SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 6 lun 0 return code = 28000002 
17:37:08 master kernel: extra data not valid Current error sd08:10: sense key Hardware Error 
17:37:08 master kernel: Additional sense indicates Internal target failure 
17:37:08 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 2, absolute sector 2
in a weeks time various sectors have intermittently received errors:
10:22:48 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 2, absolute sector 2 
03:33:11 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 2, absolute sector 2 
16:49:22 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 1933668, absolute sector 1933668 
11:00:52 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 146, absolute sector 146 
10:19:10 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 146, absolute sector 146 
17:37:08 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 2, absolute sector 2 
21:05:47 master kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:10, sector 11436178, absolute sector 11436178
this disk was new when installed but i have seen the same error on another system i have
employing the same controller and disk combination which also posted the same return code ( and
sector in this case ) with the exception being that the kernel is a 2.2.0-pre6,  the driver 
is a 2.1.15 and the disk is SCA with an SCA to 68-pin adapter:
06:33:09 irc kernel: SCSI disk error : host 0 channel 0 id 1 lun 0 return code = 28000002 
06:33:09 irc kernel: extra data not valid Current error sd08:02: sense key Hardware Error 
06:33:09 irc kernel: Additional sense indicates Internal target failure 
06:33:09 irc kernel: scsidisk I/O error: dev 08:02, sector 2 
did i get ahold of a batch of bad disks? one disk came in a bulk purchase but the other
was purchased from a different vendor. ( ARGH! i just spoke to one of my vendors and he stated
that he is seeing a high failure rate on IBM Ultra Star disks. he also said the Ultra  
Star product line is being "end-of-lifed" by IBM, so that my be my answer to this issue :< )
any insight would be greatly appreciated.
i'm getting that sync-ing feeling,
mark
