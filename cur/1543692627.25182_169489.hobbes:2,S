Referring to the latest patch I sent:
arch/i386/Kconfig:
The only problems seem to be some CPU_ONLY_* derived symbols I haven't 
yet found a better solution for.
arch/i386/Makefile:
There are two ifdefs to deal with Pentium 4 and K7/K8 selected at the 
same time:
ifdef CONFIG_CPU_PENTIUM4
  cpuflags-$(CONFIG_CPU_K{7,8})    := ...
else
  cpuflags-$(CONFIG_CPU_K{7,8})    := ...
endif
That's perhaps not optimal but IMHO not that bad.
The dozens of ifdefs were in other areas where I tried to add some 
additional space optimizations. It was a mistake to put them into the 
same patch and in the latest patches I sent they were already separated 
and they are _not_ required for the CPU selection scheme.
