Subject: SCSI CD-ROM problems in 2.2.0-prex?

I have bizarre problems with reading burned CDRs under 2.2.0-prex
affecting as far at least 2.2.0-pre[5-7]. The last part of the data
on the disk is not read due to io errors. Probably I've done something
really dumb, but anyway..... 
btw I'm not subscribed so please cc me with any replies.
Hardware:
PPro
Advansys Ultra/narrow SCSI
TEAC CDR55S CD-recorder
df on the filesystem shows:
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/sr0              521382  521382        0    100%   /mnt/cdrom2
or
/dev/hdc              521382  521382        0    100%   /mnt/cdrom
cp /mnt/cdrom2/* ./junk terminates with io errors before the end of
the last file on disk. The log file shows messages like:
Jan 16 12:10:51 localhost kernel: Current error sr0b:00: sense key Blank Check
Jan 16 12:10:51 localhost kernel: CD-ROM I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 1042736
Jan 16 12:10:51 localhost kernel: SCSI CD error : host 0 id 1 lun 0 return code 
= 28000002
Jan 16 12:10:51 localhost kernel: Current error sr0b:00: sense key Blank Check
Jan 16 12:10:51 localhost kernel: CD-ROM I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 1042740
Jan 16 12:10:51 localhost kernel: SCSI CD error : host 0 id 1 lun 0 return code 
= 28000002
This disk was created using the command:
mkisofs -R -T -v -f . | cdrecord -dev=1,0 -speed=4 -v -tsize=285591s  -
although I have the same symptom on disks where mkisofs output to an
intermediate file.
The disks read fine (or at least without reported errors) either
from /dev/hdc (Mitsumi FX120T ATAPI drive) under the same kernel
versions, and read fine using the stock Red Hat 2.0.36 kernels
using either /dev/sr0 or /dev/hdc. Given that it reads fine
on other systems it seems like either the advansys or sr
driver is the cause.
My base system is Red Hat 5.1 with updated utilities as
described in Changes from the Rawhide distribution.
I would be willing to help try solve this -- although I am
fairly fluent in C I have no kernel hacking experience.
