tcp_keepalive_intvl...
tcp starts a keepalive timer for each connection. if the connection is idle
for tcp_keepalive_time seconds, it starts sending probes to the other end.
It sends a maximum of tcp_keepalive_probes each tcp_keepalive_intvl
seconds apart, and if the other end hasnt responded by then, it drops the
connection.
default values:
tcp_keepalive_intvl = 75 seconds
tcp_keepalive_probes = 9
tcp_keepalive_time = 7200 seconds (2 hours)
