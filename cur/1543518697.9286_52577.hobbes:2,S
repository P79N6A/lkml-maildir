There could be another use of this always_keep_alive option.
(A keep alive use, this time :))
If you have a telnet/ssh session through a linux box that masquerade,
every connection without a packet emmitted for 15 minute will be shutdown.
You can configure the masquerading box, but it is not always desirable.
You can also use the keep alive option and put the time between two keep
alive at 13 min, for example. And this will work only with ssh because
telnet does not do a setsockopt KEEP_ALIVE.
Solutions :
-patch telnet and other applications ... :(
-allow the alwayskeepalivebehaviour in the kernel
-The solution that will make everybody agree but that nobody know ( hope
I'm wrong)
