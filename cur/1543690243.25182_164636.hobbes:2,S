Subject: Why is the Compaq W8000 ACPI blacklisted?

	Since test4, I've had
Compaq Workstation W8000 detected: force use of acpi=ht
	which leads to
ACPI: Interpreter disabled.
	and that to annoying things like spinning down my IDE drive, which it
isn't configured to do and doesn't happen in test3, and not powering off
on shutdown.
	I see the entry doing this (./arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c:922)
        { force_acpi_ht, "Compaq Workstation W8000", {
                        MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "Compaq"),
                        MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "Workstation W8000"),
                        NO_MATCH, NO_MATCH }},
	introduced in test4. But why? Are there problems with more advanced
features like sleep?
	acpi=force on test5 returns me to the functionality I had in test3.
