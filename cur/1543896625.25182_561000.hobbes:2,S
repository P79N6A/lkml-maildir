Should be the same with 2.6.21 and earlier, the "new" allocator should
do exactly the samething, it just fixes the breakage introduced in the
post-2.6.21 cleanup.

How far away are they?

That would also allow multiple subsystems to use them at the same time.
And whoever adds the second user of those MSRs might not be aware of the
just-grant-it policy of the allocator. And bugs that arise due to such
problems will probably become a real PITA to track down.
Unfortunately, I don't see any elegant solution to this atm, and of
course making your code simply circumvent the allocator isn't an option
either.
Thanks,
Björn
