I think tuning for NUMA issues are different. The intention/scope of this patch was to provide an efficient interrupt routing in software that would work for dual/SMP P4P based systems.  Although we found this improved older systems as well, there was no need to do this earlier since it was done by the chipsets in the platform and software did not have any thing to do.
