Not even if you're adding an epoll watcher inside another epoll watcher?
The problem I have here is that "a single fd was added a single time
inside the other 1000+ fds" is different behaviour to the daemons out
there.  They're pretty much all using flat layouts:
process 1:
 epoll_watcher:
  leaf fd
  leaf fd 2
  leaf fd 3
  leaf fd 4
  ...
process 2:
 epoll_watcher:
  ...
While the attack happens inside a single process.
Indeed, if you had a _per_process_ watcher limit, you would stop the
attack working while not breaking at least postfix and apache.  I'm not
sure what Java's doing under the hood, I have a feeling it's more
thready.
But most of all a way of detecting between a leaf fd and an epoll
watcher fd in epoll_ctl and doing deeper tests if it's an epoll watcher
that's being added would stop the attack.
