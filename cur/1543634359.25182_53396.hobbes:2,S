Did not try this yet (will do it tomorrow evening), but the X failure was 
related to my mouse setup: /dev/mouse pointed to /dev/psaux which is not 
available in 2.5.xx-djX. when I corrected this to /dev/mouse0 I got a working 
X again 8-)
however, when I started X from the bootscript, that is the bootscript starts 
kdm which in turn starts the X server, I got the same oops as before...
the process that causes the oops appears to be chmod, if you want the whole 
oops, please tell and I will write it down (cannot use a serial console...).
so the agpgart split seems to work fine here, but there is clearly something 
wrong when kde2 tries to start.
