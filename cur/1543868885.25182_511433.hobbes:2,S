Argh ..I should keep referring to recent sources. I didnt see
cancel_work_sync() in my sources (2.6.20-rc4) and hence invented that 
del_work()! Anyway thanx for pointing out.
This change will probably let us do CPU_DOWN_PREPARE after
freeze_processes(). However I will keep my fingers crossed on whether it
is really a good idea to send CPU_DOWN/UP_PREPARE after
freeze_processes() until we get more review/testing results.
