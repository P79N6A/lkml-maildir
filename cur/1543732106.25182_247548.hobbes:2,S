Subject: CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ on i386 unavailable?

Hi all,
In the latest 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, Documentation/sysrq.txt seems to
still mention that MAGIC SYSRQ is still available, however I can not
find it in the configuration.  When I add CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ to
.config and run oldconfig, it vanishes.
What is the prefered method of enabling magic sysrq on i386?  That was
a really nice feature.  I hope it has not been removed.
Thanks,
Jeremy
