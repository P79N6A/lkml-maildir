Hi Pavel,
Hehe - the WSLs are already reality.  Sitecom is a producer of
these and you can get another brand from ThinkGeek.
Sitecom device:
http://www.sitecom.com/products_info.php?product_id=293&grp_id=1
ThinkGeek:

Why in kernel?   Well, the device is based on the Cypress Ultra
Mouse.  So with a non WSL aware kernel the events from the WSL
will be merged into the standard mouse input queue which will
make your mouse pointer move uncontrollable - it'll jump across
the screen in a couple of steps every 3 seconds or so.
Quite amusing but not very handy!
The problem is described here:

The WSL kernel driver will translate the device packets to a
separate event queue.
And you're right.  The WSL driver is not a standalone thingy -
you'll some userland tools as well.  These can be gotten from:
http://www.schau.com/l/wsl/index.html
The tools contains a patch for xscreensaver (patch submitted to
maintainer) and a small WSL monitor program which will monitor
in-range/out-of-range signals and disable/enable xscreensaver
as needed.
