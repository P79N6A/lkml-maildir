Greetings.
I am using a 2.4 Linux workstation in text mode (no graphic interface).
After some time, Linux activates the "screensaver" and the monitor goes 
blank on "stand by" mode until activity is detected from the mouse or 
keyboard.
Is it possible to disable this screensaver, so that the monitor keeps on 
all the time?
Thanks in advance.
