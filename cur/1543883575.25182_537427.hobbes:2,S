include/linux/gfp.h:
#define GFP_ATOMIC (__GFP_HIGH)
#define GFP_KERNEL (__GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_FS)
So combining GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL gives you
"allow io, allow fs, allow waiting, and use emergency pools when it's getting
tight"
which to me looks like a valid, but probably unwanted combination.
Perhaps this could be shuffled a little to make such combinations
less likely, by moving this around as follows:

Then a line like
  if ((flags & (GFP_ATOMIC | GFP_KERNEL)) == (GFP_ATOMIC | GFP_KERNEL))
	BUG();
could work.
Might have more implications. (And definitely, some more kernel code
would need to be fixed up.)
