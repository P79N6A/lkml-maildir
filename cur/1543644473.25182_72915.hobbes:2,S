I suspect a fair number of cases is preemption too, when you fire up
computation threads in the background.  Of course, the preemption
event always goes through the kernel at some point, even if it's only
a SIGALARM.
Actually, in normal programs (even java ones), _when_ is a thread
voluntarily giving up control?  Locks?
  OG.
