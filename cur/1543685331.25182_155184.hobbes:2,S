It worked for me.  There is nothing in recent kernels that would
affect this.
What errors do you get?
Can you describe your setup in a bit more detail.
One thing to be careful of is that you cannot export a directory and a
parent of that directory in the same filesystem to the same client.
This tripped me up the first time I tried it.
Here "parent" means in the real filesystem, ignoring any --bind
mounts.
