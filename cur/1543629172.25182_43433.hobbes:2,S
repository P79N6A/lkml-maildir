A very important distinction. I'm not willing to sacrifice any of my
music CDs to the experiment, but if userspace reads are what block the
whole system, that explains why everybody claims that everybody else
is crazy.  All of my tests have been pure kernel-space (fs) accesses,
This is probably why I haven't seen any blockages.
Moral of the story: don't rip scratched CDs on server boxes
(at least -- nut until this is fixed, anyways).
