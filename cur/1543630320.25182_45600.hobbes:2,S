100% agreed.
Part of the design of citool was an attempt to guide people towards
doing that.  We encourage people to do the detailed stuff on the file
comments and the logical level comment on the changeset.  Think of file
as the "how" and the changeset as the "what".
The good news is that people do tend to get better once they realize
that other people read this stuff.
