I should point out that James wrote most of the Summit code, not me (I did
the original NUMA-Q code) - I'm splitting it out into manageable chunks
and debugging it (it breaks NUMA-Q at the moment, but I think that's fixed
now it's in nice bite-sized pieces).

Excellent - thankyou for this. When it's abstracted out (as the patches
I'll send out as soon as I've got them tested do), it should be much
easier to merge things together.

That should be what the current 2.4 summit code uses ... oddly it's
physical in 2.4, and logical in 2.5 ... don't ask why ;-) If you meant
logical, that sounds like a good plan.
