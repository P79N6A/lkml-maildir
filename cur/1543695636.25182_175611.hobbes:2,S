I am having trouble compiling the 2.4.22 kernel for x86-64 non-smp. I can 
compile the smp kernel but not the regular kernel.
It seems that ksyms.c for x86-64 is looking for some smp stuff from the 
errors I am getting.
I have tried 2.4.23-8 and the problem seems gone but I get an error when 
linking fs/fs.o into vmlinux. I have attached the errors I received.
TIA,
