I've not got any dual channel devices to test, and in fact I couldn't
find anyone with dual channel stuff at all. The caching is one bug, the
fact the reset hits both channels is the other I know about.
Otherwise the libata driver is fairly similar although the timing is
pre-computed from the documentation for the DMA modes.
