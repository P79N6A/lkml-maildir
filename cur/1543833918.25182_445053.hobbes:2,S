I understand, this is not a good situation. The problem is, it's 2.4.
It is upgraded very slowly, if at all. You came around about a year after
the fact. At the time, my initial approaches threw similar regressions
(with ADSL modems). Of course it's very tempting for me to off-load both
the work and the responsibility on you.

This was my reaction too, when Dell people came knocking. But apparently,
that thing is very popular. Also, they backed up their request with
a bag of money. In the end, I was glad I did "fix" that thing. Later,
it turned out to be OEM-ed by NEC, Fujitsu, and others; our own QA
uses it a lot as well. This happens because the 210PU offers significant
savings in power and space in OEM applications, and for casual users,
it's a perfect jump drive.
It's the same kind of question as, "who even uses 2.4 anymore".
By the way, did you consider an in-kernel driver? For me, it seems much
safer to reimplement the whole thing that way than to monkey with devio
again and risk more regressions.
Another option would be to change USBDEVFS_BULK to USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB.
Did you look at doing that?
Yours,
