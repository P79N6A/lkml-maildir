When booting with i82365 compatible bridge support, the kernel
complains as such when booting.
Device 'i823650' does not have a release() function, it is broken and
must be fixed.
Badness in device_release at drivers/base/core.c:85

I don't actually have an i82365 bridge, so that might be why, but I
thought I would post it in case someone else who does have one would
know more.
