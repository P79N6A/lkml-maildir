I'm okay putting the bootparam and the workaround into the kernel,
for it is generic and we may find other platforms need it.
But I don't have a clean way to make it automatic.
This is a BIOS bug, so chipset ID will not always work.
We could list the BIOS in dmi_scan(), but I hate doing
that b/c then the vendor releases a new version of their
broken BIOS and the automatic workaround no longer works...
