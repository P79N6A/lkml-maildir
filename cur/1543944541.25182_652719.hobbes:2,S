Subject: [PATCH 0/4] async_tx: fix dependency handling and related cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Injecting channel-switch-interrupts has been broken for a while now.  It
has not been a problem in practice because the only in-tree driver that
relied on this functionality was the iop3xx version of iop-adma, and it
had a bug-masking local workaround.  Three side benefits arise from this
fix:
1/ dma_async_tx_descriptor sheds two list_heads
2/ Locking is made sane in that dma drivers no longer need to directly
   touch dma_async_tx_descriptor.lock
3/ dma_device.device_dependency_added is no longer needed
Testing shows that iop-adma now gets by without the 'watchdog'
workaround.
