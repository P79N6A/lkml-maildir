No, existing kernels would have been so slow as to be nearly unusable on 
machines with this problem.  Reducing the amount of available memory 
automatically might work in most cases, but as Venki pointed out, people will 
have to check their logs to notice that anything is wrong.
But I don't have a strong preference, maybe just a boot time message (with 
suitably obnoxious ascii art) would be sufficient.
