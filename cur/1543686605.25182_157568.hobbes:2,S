Just to second Oleg's messages so far, the verification issues are still
serious, it could be the same kind of memory corruptions that could be
causing crashes on reiserfs, just in a different place.
We need to find out if a specific kernel release is causing these
corruptions.  There are lots of different ways to go about it, I would
suggest a combination of fsx (triggers IO and does verification) and
usemem (sucks down ram) from the ext3 cvs progs.
When you can reliably cause either fsx-linux errors or system hangs in a
short period of time, then we can try different prereleases to find the
offending code.
(download details here:

)
Run 4 or so fsx-linux programs (each to its own file) and use usemem to
put your box into swap.  That should hit it pretty quickly, and any
errors from fsx indicate problems.
