Oh yes.  I've been through every kernel from 46 on up.  I'm using a reliable
gcc and I build kernels for all my other machines on this one too.  I'm sure
I could reproduce it on another machine but right now I'm pretty intensely
stuck on getting this machine operable, it's the main hub for a few dozen
different things.
It isn't 100% reproducible, I have to get numerous things going all at the
same time to get it to happen it seems.  If I don't have a bunch of things
running, it's pretty hard to trigger.  If I run wget -r in a while true
loop, I can trigger it within seconds.
