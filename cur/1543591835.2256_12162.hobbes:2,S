Neither. If user has acces to the protocol, he certainly can do some things
more. But you definitely can't check permissions on client. The trouble is,
that this limits access policy on server to what the clients understand.
Checking on server on the other hand allows server to implement any access
policy (even using 3rd party software) without having clients to know the
details (sou they can be kept stupid and simple = fast and managable)

Agree, but it will improve behavior. Or speed, rather. Otherwise open would
take 3(!) roundtrips (instead of two - now lookup can't be get rid of) -
lookup, permission and open. The protocol can do all three in one request.
The problem is I can't tell the 3 calls from VFS belong together.

Won't work for many reasons. Correct error code is one (could be removed by
pre-checking permission), exclusivity of write versus execute is the other
(can't be workaround). Checking permissions with lookup might be possible,
but won't solve the exec/write exclusion and put more trust on the client,
than is desireable.

It does not make sence (x without r). But it surely makes sence to have a
program with read but without exec permission (though it can be made to
run).
