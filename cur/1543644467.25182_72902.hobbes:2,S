I'll take a run at analyzing this.
First, it's clear why can't just set the page !uptodate: if we fail to
lock the page we can't change the state of the uptodate bit because we
would violate the locking rules, iow, we would race with the vfs (see
block_read/write_full_page).
Note that even if succeed in the TryLock and set !uptodate, we still
have to walk the rmap list and unmap the page or it won't get refaulted
and the uptodate bit will be ignored.
For any page we can't lock without blocking, the cases are:
 1) Dirty: we don't need to invalidate it because it's going to get
    written back to the server anyway
 2) Locked, clean: the page could be locked for any number of reasons.
    Probably, it's locked for reading though.  We *obviously* need to
    kill this page at some point or we have a nasty heisenbug.  E.g., 
    somebody, somewhere, will get a file handed back to them from some 
    other client that rewrote the whole thing, complete and correct
    except for a stale page or two.
For pages that we can lock, we have:
 3) Elevated count, clean: we could arguably ignore the use count
    and just yank the page out of the inode list, as Andrew's patch
    does.  Getting it out of the mapping is harder, perhaps much
    harder.
 4) Clean, has buffers, can't get rid of the buffers: we can't know
    why.  HTree puts pages in this state for directory access, Ext3
    probably does it for a variety of reasons.  Same situation as
    above.
Given the obviously broken case (2) above and the two probably broken
case (3) and (4), I don't see any way to ignore this problem and still
implement the NFS semantics Chuck described earlier.
I see Rik's suggestion of marking the problem pages invalid, and walking
the ptes to protect them as the cleanest fix.  Unlike invalidate_inode_pages,
the fault path can block perfectly happily while the problem conditions
sort themselves out.
