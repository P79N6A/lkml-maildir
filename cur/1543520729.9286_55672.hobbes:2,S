I mostly agree too.  The problem with multiple licenses however
arises when there IS a problem, and one has ASS-U-MEd that
submitted code is also dual licensed, but in fact an author did
not intend that.  It has the (as small or large as it may be)
potential for compounding legal garbage.
Keeping things simple is the easiest route.  Dual licensing
without a real good reason is just confusing.  But that doesn't
necessarily have anything to do with DinX at all.
Other than that, I mostly agree.
