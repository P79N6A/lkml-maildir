We need to support partitioning on loopback devices in that case.

A small number of other setups people wired the IDE the quick and easy
way and their native format is indeed ass backwards - some M68K disks and
the Tivo are examples of that. Interworking requires byteswapping and the
ability to handle byteswapped partition tables.
Given the ability to see partitions on loop devices all works out I think
