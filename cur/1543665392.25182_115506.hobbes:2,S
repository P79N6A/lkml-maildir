Untarring and building opencm-0.1.2alpha2-1-src.tgz generated an empty show.c 
file.  Not feeling too imaginative, I did:
-int show_c(SDR_stream *strm, const Buffer *input);
+int show_c(SDR_stream *strm, const Buffer *input) { return 0; }
in Browse.c, and was rewarded with a build.
Is this still on-topic for lkml?

Daniel
