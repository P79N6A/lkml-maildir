I believe that should do it. dmesg doesn't have any info about the ataraid
driver being loaded? If it's scrolling out of the kernel buffer, you can try
bumping up the size through the kernel config. The option is under the "Kernel
Hacking" section and is CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT. Change it to 17 or 18 to be sure.
A reboot with this new kernel should give you a full dmesg afterward, hopefully
showing what's wrong with the ataraid stuff.

PS. I don't remember when this took place, but there were some changes to the
promise drivers in 2.4 around 2.4.21 I think. There should be drivers for both
the older Promise and the newer. I remember always choosing both, complete with
pdcraid just to be sure.
