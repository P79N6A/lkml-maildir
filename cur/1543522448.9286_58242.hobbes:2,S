Achim,
Have a look at the scsi generic (sg) web site at:
http://www.torque.net/sg
  [follow utility + fast copy links]
In the utilities is a "dd" variant called sgp_dd. It allows 
the number of blocks per transfer (i.e. per SCSI command) to 
be controlled as well as the number of commands queued to
the device. The latter is done by POSIX worker threads, the
number of which are specified on the command line.
sgp_dd is significantly faster than dd performing disk to disk 
copies.
