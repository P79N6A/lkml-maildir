Well, I'm working backward from an "unacceptable fix", where I changed
a bunch of things defensively at once and (of course) it was adding the
printk()'s that actually fixed things.
One of those changes was to ditch the schedule_work() shenanigans in
do_boot_cpu(), which was actually meant to rule out the initializers
for the struct create_idle getting miscompiled or otherwise not
behaving as I expected.
