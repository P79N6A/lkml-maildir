OK, after I've stopped being an idiot, and misreading the code, I have 
some numbers. They still look pretty good to me. I shrunk us from
1,048,576 buckets to 65536, and loaded 1,150,000 entries in there.

It's not perfect, but not bad either. Some mathematician can go calculate
just how imperfect it is over random distribution, but it looks OK to me ;-)
