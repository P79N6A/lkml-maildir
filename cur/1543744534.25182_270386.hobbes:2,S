VM_LOCKED|VM_IO doesn't seem to be a sane combination.  VM_LOCKED means
"don't page it out" and VM_IO means "an IO region".  The kernel never even
attempts to page out IO regions because they don't have reverse mappings. 
Heck, they don't even have pageframes.
How about you drop the VM_LOCKED?

Spose we could do that on the basis of "don't break existing drivers which
are doing peculiar things".
