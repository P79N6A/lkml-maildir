   It is not a showstopper. Your capabilities do NOT prevent you from
   trojan horses. If you run program with uid=0, it does not need any
   special privileges to screw you up. [Hint: who is owner of /etc/passwd?]
Then don't run programs setuid root!  This is why using setuid root as
the method for marking that a file has capabilities is a complete
non-starter, as we have discussed before.
