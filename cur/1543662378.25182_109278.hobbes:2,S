Sounds logical.  My reasoning was more of a coin toss.

Now that think about it, enable really is the same as start/stop, but
the status is still something different.  I didn't really talk about it,
but my intent was to provide the information currently available from
the WDIOC_GETSTATUS ioctl, which is a value composed of the following
flags:
#define	WDIOF_OVERHEAT		0x0001	/* Reset due to CPU overheat */
#define	WDIOF_FANFAULT		0x0002	/* Fan failed */
#define	WDIOF_EXTERN1		0x0004	/* External relay 1 */
#define	WDIOF_EXTERN2		0x0008	/* External relay 2 */
#define	WDIOF_POWERUNDER	0x0010	/* Power bad/power fault */
#define	WDIOF_CARDRESET		0x0020	/* Card previously reset the CPU */
#define WDIOF_POWEROVER		0x0040	/* Power over voltage */
#define WDIOF_SETTIMEOUT	0x0080  /* Set timeout (in seconds) */
#define WDIOF_MAGICCLOSE	0x0100	/* Supports magic close char */
#define	WDIOF_KEEPALIVEPING	0x8000	/* Keep alive ping reply */
I debated with myself if each of these flags should be broke out into
their own file, and I'm still not sure if it is better to keep the
status as a single file.
