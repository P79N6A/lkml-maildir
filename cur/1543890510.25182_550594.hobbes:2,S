I believe that the current functionality is that /sbin/hotplug is the default.  
I think that if there is one in initramfs, it'll get called as a usermode 
helper, even before init has run.  (If it needs /proc /sys or /dev, setting 
it up properly is its problem, but not an insurmountable one.)
I remember discussion of this a while back, and that it was indeed 
intentional.  I dunno if anybody's actually tried it.
