If I hold my finger on alt & right arrow, to cycle through tty's,
every now and then the display breaks up, and the monitor goes way
out of sync for a second or so before returning back to normal.
This does need physical console access to do though, so I'm not concerned :)
I doubt that it's harmful either, just.. strange.
The card is a Matrox Millenium, with frame buffer support compiled in.
