Hi,
I was wondering if anybody has got MSI-X going on AMD 8132 platforms.
Our network card and driver support MSI-X and the combination works
fine on IA64 and xeon platforms. But on the 8132, the MSI-X vectors are
assigned(pci_enable_msix succeeds) but no interrupts get generated.
Note that with a different OS, MSI-X does work on 8132.
Any suggestions are appreciated.
Thanks,
Ravi
