Subject: [PATCH] loop.c doesn't fail init gracefully
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

THIS PATCH:
loop_init doesn't fail gracefully for two reasons:
1)If initialization of loop driver fails, we have an call to devfs_add("loop") 
without any devfs_remove; I add that.
2) On lwn.net 2.6 kernel docs, Jonathan Corbet says:
"If you are calling add_disk() in your driver initialization routine, you 
should not fail the initialization process after the first call."
So I make loop.c conform to this request by moving add_disk after all memory 
allocations.
CC me on reply as I'm not subscribed, please.
