I do, but now that I know that the problem is, and why the fix was done, 
I'm ambivalent as to how it should be fixed.  In this case the dog 
getting bit is tar (I have NDI if dump is also effected as I don't use 
it), and I would rather see tar made immune to the effects of a patch 
that was originally made to correct practice into a little closer to what 
the preacher said.
I see the facts as:
 1. the name of the directory didn't change,
 2. the inode contents aren't (ANAICT) modified in any way, and
 3. the file is still the file it was back in July of last year when I 
wrote it.
Perhaps someone can explain to me why tar thinks its all new just because 
the mapper was spanked and made to be a good puppy?
In my mind at least, its tar that has the egg on its face, and its tar 
that needs to be immunized.  Can someone tell me where am I wrong?
I'd really like to know why there is an apparent connection between this, 
and tars response, which is to think the whole disk is new and has to 
have a level 0 backup all over again.
