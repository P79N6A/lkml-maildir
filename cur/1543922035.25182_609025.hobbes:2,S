Subject: 2.6.22.7 reboots if PCI-X eth card is used for capture

Hi,
i run a machine with 4 dual gigabit ethernet cards utilizing 2.6.22.7.
All cards are PCI-E, one card is PCI-X, all Gigabit Ethernet from Intel.
This is working fine and stable if only the PCI-E cards are used.
If i try to capture packets on the PCI-X card, the machine reboots after
some seconds. I think i can rule out a hardware defect, as i actually
run two of this machines with equal hard and software and the problem
occurs on both machines. This is perfectly reproducible but i am unable
to debug this, as no (oops) messages are ever written to the syslog. 
As the machine instantly reboots i guess there will be nothing valueable
shown on the display. 
The interrupt layout:
(cat /proc/interrupts)
 16:         36          6        430          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   eth0
 18:         33          5        305        126   IO-APIC-fasteoi   uhci_hcd:us
b1, ehci_hcd:usb4, eth1
211:       2143       2210     127682        533   PCI-MSI-edge      eth9
212:       5332       5818      10298    3594001   PCI-MSI-edge      eth8
213:        129      46419    5525683          6   PCI-MSI-edge      eth7
214:      13528      14184      34425   11239040   PCI-MSI-edge      eth6
215:      50277        116    5821388         14   PCI-MSI-edge      eth5
216:        595        590     347154        857   PCI-MSI-edge      eth4
217:         48        153       5760       2653   PCI-MSI-edge      eth2
The card in question is eth0+eth1. I even tried the following boot kernel parameters
with NO success.
	nousb (don't need it, suspected the irq sharing as problem source)
	pci=nomsi (this recommended my hardware vendor)
I need some advice, howto debug or solve this.
As i usually don't read the list, i would like to be cc'd. 
Cheers
Michael
