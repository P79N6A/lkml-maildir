It could be that we never call test_clear_page_writeback() against
!bdi_cap_writeback_dirty() pages anwyay.  I can't think why we would, but
the relationships there aren't very clear.  Does "don't account for dirty
memory" imply "doesn't ever do writeback"?  One would need to check, and
it's perhaps a bit fragile.
It's worth checking though.  Boy we're doing a lot of stuff in there
nowadays.
OT: it might be worth looking into batching this work up - the predominant
caller should be mpage_end_io_write(), and he has a whole bunch of pages
which are usually all from the same file, all contiguous.  It's pretty
inefficient to be handling that data one-page-at-a-time, and some
significant speedups may be available.
Instead, everyone seems to think that variable pagecache page size is the
only way of improving things.  Shudder.
