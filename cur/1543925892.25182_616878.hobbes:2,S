Hey, if somebody has time to break things, then they damn well ought
to be able to make time to fix them again.  And the best developers
here on LKML do just that (fix what they break).
You broke it, you fix it.  A simple rule.
Translation for the particularly daft:
If you've been making significant updates to a driver/subsystem,
and people are reporting that it is now broken for them,
then it's your job to make it right.  The reporters can help,
and many may even git-bisect or send patches.  
But you cannot *expect* or *insist* upon them doing your job.
