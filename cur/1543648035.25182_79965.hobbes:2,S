Here are the contest (
http://contest.kolivas.net
) benchmark results for
2.5.42-mm3 and how it compares to mm2 - statistical significance from mm3
indicated by *

There really is no other load on the machine during this noload run. It seems
that the mem_load flushing prior to 2.5 kernels seems to make the kernel compile
start more slowly (with heavy disk activity), and mm2/3 are showing this more.
This may be an artifact of what happens to the vm after mem_load has been run.
