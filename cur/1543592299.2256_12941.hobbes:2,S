Erm... May I point you to the sysdep/libm-ieee754/e_j0.c? There's a bunch
of constants of unknown origin. If you want to modify the implementation
you most certainly want more than numeric values.
Same goes for any tables that contain anything besides well-known constants.
Should we file bug reports against glibc?
