Hi!
I have a 10/100 ethernet pcmcia card, and after some probing I have found,
that although it is not recorgnized by the pcmcia package, it can be, by
adding
card "Microcom C.E. Travel Card LAN 10/100 1.0"
  version "Microcom C.E.", "Travel Card LAN 10/100", "1.0"
  bind "pcnet_cs"
to /etc/pcmcia/config. After findig this (I have experienced with Trinux,
easy to tweak) I have written this to David Hinds, who I think is the
pcmcia maintainer, and suggest@redhat.com, because I want an install disk
recognizing my card. Neither did answer. The problem is, the pcmcia
package on the supplementary disk of RH5.2 is in some .cgz format, I
gunzipped it|cpio -i -d, then edited the file, but when I cpio and gzip it
back (gzip -9 to have it fit on the floppy), and put on the disk, the
install says it has an error uncpio-ing it. So, I have seen many RedHat
people around here, maybe someone knows:
- what cpio options to use to create pcmcia.cgz
- whom should I contact at RedHat
- who may provide me with such a disk ready
- is there a workaround?
- how else can I get linux on my notebook (it now runs trinux distrib.
  booted from the HDD, runs on ramdisks, but I can fdisk and mount any
  partition on the HDD)
-what files to copy on the dos partition to be able to do a minimum HDD
  install?
