	Good catch, but... that's not all.  We also have to move
drop_file_write_access() in __fput() past the file_kill(), or we'll
get a race here - CPU 1 enters that loop, sees ->f_count 1, checks
that file is writable, CPU 2 does final fput() and proceeds to
do drop_file_write_access() and mnt_drop_write().  CPU 1, in the
meanwhile, removes FMODE_WRITE and goes on to do mnt_drop_write()
itself.
	Oh, well...  Fixed.
