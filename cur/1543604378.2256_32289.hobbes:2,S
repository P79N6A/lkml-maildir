Eh.  Seems my brain has managed to filter that out thus far.
Probably as "uninteresting" is the only thing I can say :)
What is interesting is that in current vfat I can toggle
+x bit on and off with chmod.  So it seems like VFS does
not consult with fs anymore about bits.  But you know
that already.
Oh well...
