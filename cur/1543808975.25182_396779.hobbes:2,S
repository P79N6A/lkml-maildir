OS Independant? Almost every userspace library that a linux system uses is OS 
independant. Stable interface? That's much harder since _most_ libraries 
change their interfaces incrementally as new technology or techniques become 
available to support them.
I did have an idea the other day and was wondering - why can't you, Joerg, add 
the capacity to CDRECORD to silently take a given /dev entry and turn it into 
your "needed" btl mapping?

Yes, you are, but you have made a very large mistake in your thinking. As an 
application and library developer you are supposed to build an application 
that works properly inside the framework provided by the OS. If your 
application does not work within the OS, then there is either a large bug in 
the OS (Not unheard of for M$ products, but in an Open Source product like 
Linux bugs that large do not survive long) or a bug in your program.
Since there is obviously no bug in the OS, and obviously no bug in cdrecord (I 
use it about once a week to make multi-cd backups) then your complaints about 
the "badly designed /dev/hd*" interface are just complaints from a programmer 
that thinks he's smarter than a hundred other people.
Since you appear to be a proponent of Solaris and use that on a regular basis 
it's my guess that you either 1) don't have the skill to create an OS and 
release it or 2) you are so mired in history and the "beauty" of your code 
that you refuse to change it at all. In this case I think the second option 
is the truth.
