Sorry to bother you with this. I have a server
system equipped with an Adaptec U320 board,
attached a HP Ultrium 2 drive.
Since I upgraded from kernel version 2.6.13.5
to 2.6.15.4, tape write speeds dropped from
22 MB/s to 4.5 MB/s. Looks like asynchonous
write mode is now negotiated.
Any help is appreciated - please, cc to my
address above as I am not a regular reader.
Thanks,
Frithjof
