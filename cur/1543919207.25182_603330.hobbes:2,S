In which case, they would not be using the ZERO_PAGE?
If they were paging in (ie. reading) huge reams of zeroes,
then maybe their algorithms aren't so good anyway? (I don't
know).

Yeah, that's why I use the double quotes... I wonder how to
find out, though. I guess I could ask SGI if they could ask
around -- but that still comes back to the problem of not being
able to ever conclusively show that there are no real users of
the ZERO_PAGE.
Where do you suggest I go from here? Is there any way I can
convince you to try it? Make it a config option? (just kidding)
