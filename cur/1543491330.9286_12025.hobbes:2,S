Subject: Lost interrupt on IDE CD-ROM disk changer

Using the v2.2.x kernel (on a RedHat v5.2) system, I get errors on the 
initial access of my 5-disk IDE CD-ROM changer.  Using the same software 
(2.2.x / RH v5.2) on a single CD-rom drive, no problems are seen.  On 
both systems (single and 5-disk CD-ROM drives) the CD-ROM driver is built 
as a module.  The 5-disk drive is marketed by Hi-Val and OEM'd by Nakamichi.
By way of background, this is what I see at boot time:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio

hdb: IBM-DAQA-33240, ATA DISK drive
hdc: Nakamichi MJ-5.16, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hda: ST33221A, 3077MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=781/128/63, UDMA
hdb: IBM-DAQA-33240, 3098MB w/96kB Cache, CHS=787/128/63, DMA
So far, so good.
The errors are seen on the initial mount/read of the CD (which is already in 
the drive at boot time).  After mounting the drive, I attempt to read a 
directory.  After a long delay, I am shown an empty directory.  A second 
read correctly displays the files in that same directory.  Here are the 
errors I get on the initial mount/read:

Does the Nakamichi require special configuration or is this a bug in the 
PCI/IDE driver?
Thanks.
