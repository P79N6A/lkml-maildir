And the other thing I spot here is that I believe that __pa() is NOT a
short name for virt_to_phys, but __pa() is supposed to return the offset
into physical memory, not the address OF physical memory (which virt_to_phys
does).
I've already grappled with this on the ARM since we have a similar
problem - some architectures have contiguous memory starting at either
0x00000000 or 0x10000000 (physical) or even worse memory which can be
in up to 4 banks spread out across 256MB.  No changes to the generic
code were necessary.
