 Hi,
  I'm also seeing hard crashes when using the r8169 driver, running a 32-bit 
2.6.4-rc1 kernel on a AMD64 system with a MSI K8T motherboard (VIA KT800). It 
has an onboard Realtek 8110S chip.
  When I stopped using the r8169 module the crashes stopped. Now using a PCI 
rtl8139 nic temporarily.
  Is there any way to apply these newer -netdev patches without resorting to 
-mm tree? This is a production machine, so I'd rather stick to linus' 2.6.x, 
but if there's no choice I'll try -mm...
 Thanks in advance for your attention.
Claudio
