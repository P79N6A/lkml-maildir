The main problem is still the sprintf optimization, so 
--fno-builtin-sprintf should fix it too.
That leaves only the single strchr, which is caused by an strpbrk 
optimization in zoran_procfs.c, where we could use --fno-builtin-strpbrk 
or simply directly replace that strpbrk with strchr.
If we really want to keep -ffreestanding, we have to rework how string.h 
is organized to allow enabling builtin functions, but still provide fall 
back functions. For example we had to add a lot of "#define foo 
__builtin_foo" to linux/string.h and "#undef foo" to lib/string.c.
bye, Roman
