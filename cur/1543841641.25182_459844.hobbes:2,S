I don't think there is something special about perfmon. In my mind, uuid looked
more convenient than strings. But if this is too 'unique' for the kernel, I can look
at switching over to an ascii string. Today the uuid is encapsulated into a struct
that is passed to pfm_create_context(). I would like to avoid doing:
	struct pfm_context {
		char *uuid;
		int fd;
		....
	};
We could do:
	struct pfm_context {
		char uuid[UUID_LEN];
		int fd;
		...
	};
Or add the string to the syscall itself:
	pfm_create_context(struct pfm_context *ctx, char *uuid, void *smpl_arg, size_t arg_sz)
When no format is needed uuid=NULL.
Is there a kernel preference on that?

But here this is not about the perfmon interface, the version applies to the interface of the
sampling format kernel module itself, e.g., we could have a new version with some extensions.
With the string we could use the name to encode the version number. But we could also use
a generic name and have the more detailed version in the remapped smaping buffer header
managed by the format.
