Okay, thanks.  That's good.

This is where I'd submit the patch, but Alan evidently works 80 hours
a day.  ;)  The new patch is already in ac24.
Alan, FYI, I tested the patch on my SMP motherboard with CONFIG_SMP
(and maxcpus=0,1,unspecified) and with all combinations of
CONFIG_X86_UP_{,IO}APIC) and Michael tested CONFIG_SMP and
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC on his non-SMP motherboard, so I don't think this
will come back to bite anyone.
Thanks!
