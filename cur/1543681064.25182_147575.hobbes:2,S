I've been slab allocating the stack on i386 for some time, and it has
gone without incident in pgcl, -wli, -mjb (?), and so on. kmalloc() is
fine; there isn't any particularly compelling reason for a dedicated
slab as there's no preconstruction to do, though it can be arranged.
Basically, it works, there's no obvious reason not to, and (even better)
it's not totally invisible to the VM and even makes overhead reportable.
akpm, this is a two line change with almost no effect apart from
theoretically improved SMP efficiency and more accurate reporting.
Shall we?
