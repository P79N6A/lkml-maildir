I added "waitpid(pid,NULL,0);" after the outer-most if.. which is where 
the grand parent cleans up the pid of the intermediate parent. 
However, now trying the daemon() function..  which seems to work the 
same way.. it definately leaves a pid around.. so I guess you really 
need to do a wait() in the parent after forking.. however you don't know 
exactly which pid to wait for so you might be reaping some other child 
you've previously spawned.. 
So, for now I'm going to stick with the explicit double fork code.
Thanks!
