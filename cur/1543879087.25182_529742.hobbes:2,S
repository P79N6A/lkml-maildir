Subject: [PATCH 4/4] UML - Don't try to handle signals on initial process stack
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/11/212

Code running on the initial UML stack can't receive or process signals
since current must be valid when IRQs are handled, and there is no
current for this stack.
So, instead of using UML_LONGJMP and UML_SETJMP, which are careful
to save and restore signal state, and, as a side-effect, handle any
deferred signals, start_idle_thread must use the bare equivalents,
which don't do anything with signals.
