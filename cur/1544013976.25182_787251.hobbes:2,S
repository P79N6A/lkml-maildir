No, I was talking about physical mounting issues; as I said earlier in
the e-mail message you replied to (you must not have read my e-mail
carefully), Pavel ran into a problem where the SD card protruded
slightly from the laptop case, and it would easily (via physical
contact) get loosed from its connector so that it would become
disconnected from the laptop, causing it to lose power, sometimes
while it was writing, leading to filesystem corruptions.
