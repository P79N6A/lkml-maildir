After a long pause it then looped, once per second with the call trace
repeating over and over again in the framebufer. Basically every time the
cursor was blinked. The end of these call traces is also the above call
trace. Also, the call trace was looping due to the code being called in
an illegal context in mm/slab.c:1723.
