mm .. I should have remembered the un-official Smack motto:
"Everything is a label, and whenever possible, this label is allocated
 once through system lifetime"
About performance, yes there'll be issues searching labels espicially
in audit_rule_match() which got called at the end of every system call.
I'll try it using container_of (it should work at the end).

Probably hating secids with passion :) ?
Admittedly, after some thinking I felt now that they don't fit with
the Smack model very well.

You've meant using the short-circuit:
	 smk_rule->smk_smack == smack || strnmp(smack, ..., ..)
Right ?

This little no-op was the only thing that was agreed upon ;)
