Hi,
This is the fourth version of my patch for use LIRC drivers under
2.5/2.6 kernels.
As usual, you can find it at
http://flameeyes.web.ctonet.it/lirc/patch-lirc-20030802.diff.bz2
I changed the naming scheme, because I tried and the patch applies also
in earliers and (probably) futures kernels, and call it only
"patch-lirc.diff" will confuse about the versions. I think a datestamp
is the best choice for now.
This version includes minor changes, but an important one, Koos Vriezen
sent me another fixes for lirc_serial driver (thanks, at the moment I
haven't a serial device, and the electronic shops are closed, so I can't
test it directly).
Also I removed the .Makefile.swp present in the last patch (I forgot to
close KVim before do the diff).
This is also the first patch I post to the official lirc mailing list,
HTH other lirc users that want to pass to 2.5/2.6 kernels.
