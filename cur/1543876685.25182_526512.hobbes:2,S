Yes it is. Actually you had already mentioned it in the previous mail that's
why I did not repeat it here. Xen folks wanted to continue using vmlinux
for capturing dump. I am not sure if there is any technical limitation in
using relocatable bzImage or just that they wanted to continue using
existing working interface and did not want to switch to new interface.
Magnus, Horms, do you want to add to it? Is there a reason that relocatable
bzImage will not work in Xen env and we need to retain CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START
option in x86_64?

Yes, but x86_64 will not have any of those options and only way to run 
kernel will be either use kexec or modify your boot-loader to so that
it can handle relocatable images.

Performing relocations in vmlinux will be interesting. That way i386 vmlinux
too will become relocatable and only piece of puzzle to solve will be to
make vmlinux of type ET_DYN.
