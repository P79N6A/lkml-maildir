Yeah, well (and the i960).. I don't think it's very likely that we'll ever 
support that in the kernel ;)
(There are others. i432 is the really *classic* intel architecture. It was 
such a spectacular failure that it's still remembered today, even though 
it was never actually used).

Well, we'veliterally had bugs because people who modified i386 files 
didn't even *realize* that they were also used on x86-64. 
I do agree that we'd need to look at do the same thing for include files, 
for the same reason.
