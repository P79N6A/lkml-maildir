Some of the dumps in there looks like ethernet headers.  For example,
in comment #7:
000: 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a 5a
010: 5a 5a 00 11 85 6a 0f ef 00 e0 52 cf 6c 00 08 00
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
That looks like an ethernet header for an IPv4 packet to ethernet
destination MAC 00:11:85:6a:0f:ef from ethernet source MAC
00:e0:52:cf:6c:00
But this chunk is OK since we are looking at a neighbouring
INUSE object.
The reocurring corruption:
0b0: 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b ff ff ff ff
0c0: 00 00 00 00 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b 6b
is less identifyable.  Although tg3_alloc_rx_skb() shows up
consistently in the neighbouring objects, the actually
corrupted piece is marked by release_mem() which is the
TTY layer.
The corruption is always a 32-bit 0xffffffff followed by
a 32-bit 0x00000000, 12 bytes into the object.
If it's sitting next to RX ethernet packets, it's probably
something in the vacinity of 1500+ bytes in size as that's
how large the RX skb data areas will be that the tg3 driver
allocates unless it is in Jumbo MTU mode.
By default, do_tty_write() will use a chunk size of 2048 for the write
buffer, tty->write_buf, and this is freed up as part of release_mem()
processing.
Another possibility, is the struct tty_struct itself since that is a
sizable structure too.  And this theory is supported by
alloc_tty_struct() being in some of the triggering backtraces.
Perhaps a TTY refcounting problem or race condition of some sort.
What is 12-bytes into the tty_struct on x86?  The struct tty_ldisc,
"ldisc" is.  Oddly enough, this doesn't match up, since we'd expect
TTY_LDISC_MAGIC (0x5403) and instead we see 0xffffffff there.
Also, after the magic, we'd expect the address of the "n_tty"
string in tty_ldisc_N_TTY to show up in the next word, instead
we find NULL (0x00000000) there.
Something is clobbering the ldisc member of this free'd tty_struct is
seems.  Maybe there is some problem with ldisc refcounting.
