Subject: [PATCH 05/15] mm: unbloat get_futex_key
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/9/429

The follow_page changes in get_futex_key have left it with two almost
identical blocks, when handling the rare case of a futex in a nonlinear
vma.  get_user_pages will itself do that follow_page, and its additional
find_extend_vma is hardly any overhead since the vma is already cached.
Let's just delete the follow_page block and let get_user_pages do it.
