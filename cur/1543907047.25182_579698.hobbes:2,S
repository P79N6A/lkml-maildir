You mean to say, the granularity of msleep is in mS with a tolerance
of +/- "n" mS whereas nanosleep would have the tolerance in nS ?
(ignoring all the discussions about hrtimers and their internal
design)
I guess many people are/were confused on the aspect that, a msleep(1)
meant sleep for a 1mS and nothing more. Well, this would explain, some
of my hair raising incidents, if i understood you correctly.
Since it is such a confusion, maybe it needs to be documented some
place, that people don't fall into the same trap.
