	Well, exporting devices over NFS is always tricky, because if
the server isn't an identical OS, you can't even trust the numbers.  As
you point out, you get the platform's idea of a device number, and that
doesn't map to your local OS.
	It is no different than today.  You have to make sure that the
server's filesystem stores device numbers valid for the client if the
client wants to use those device nodes.
