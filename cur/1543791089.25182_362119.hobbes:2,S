Which is one of the reasons I've started working on fixing up the
platform device/driver stuff to conform to the "usual" method,
with the view to killing off _all_ the function pointers in
struct device_driver.
Most bus types wrap struct device_driver, and then provide their own
function pointers which pass their bus-type specific device structure.
This does two things: 1. it centralises the conversion from struct
device to struct whatever_device, and 2. improves typechecking.
However, once the use of the function pointers in struct device_driver
have been eliminated, we can be sure of reclaiming at least 20 bytes
per device driver, maybe more if GCC does insane padding.
