That's how I understand it as well, it does not stop the loading of the 
non GPL module, it just taints the kernel (sets a flag).

One thing I don't get is; how does this solve the problem?  As I 
understood it the problem was that people would lie in bug reports and 
say that they had no non-gpl modules loaded even if they did, becourse 
otherwise people would ignore their reports. Tainting the kernel does 
not solve that problem - users who previously lied about loaded modules 
will now just edit the Oops before posting and change the "tainted" 
message to "not tainted". Unless there is some way to validate the "not 
tainted" status of the kernel people are going to continue to lie about 
it.  Would it maybe be possible to generate some kind of "checksum" on 
the taint-state of the kernel that could be verified when recieving the 
oops (probably overkill)?
