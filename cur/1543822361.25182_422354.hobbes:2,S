The standard UP bitops are not atomic.  But a UP guest may be on SMP
machine, and the bitmaps here are shared between guests.  The always
locked means the lock prefix is not conditional on either UP build
(or smp alternatives patching), and memory barriers are in place.
There's no performance penalty unless you use them, as it's a new set
(somewhat similar to the bitops changes you were looking into).  Although,
this is the simplest, with no multiplexing, simply new interface, synch_*.
Open to ideas here.  Xen is another possible consumer of your bitops
changes.
thanks,
