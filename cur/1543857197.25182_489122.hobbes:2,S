Of course, I interest to wait this. If they have other weakless, tell me
too.
I also think the HID split plan is a great idea.

As you guess;), I do not agree with your words very much. We can image,
there
are many devices use some HID base layer, however they even do not merge
into
mainstream kernel source tree for some reasons. and in fact, I do not
like the
mainstream kernel source tree include every drivers. For such devices
out of core,
we should have such feature that let developer write such driver
quickly. I think
it allows many monster-size driver modules is a better means than
all-in-one.But we
need resolve /dev/input/event? switching problem in principle first,
else we still
encounter same problem when new hidraw come.
Good luck.
