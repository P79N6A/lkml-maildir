Compiles, boots, and behaves on my Dell Latitude C840 that previously had
indigestion.  It selected the ACPI-PM timesource right off the bat (for reasons
I don't understand, previous dynticks used the tsc timesource), so I'm not
seeing the huge clock drift issues I had with previous dyntick patches when
running 'cpuspeed' - it drops from 1.6Ghz to 1.2Ghz and back without a problem.
