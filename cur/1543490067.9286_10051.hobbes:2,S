For redundancy, sometimes is convenient to have multiple interfaces in a 
server, connected to the same network.
The idea is to get one the cards overtake the IP address when a fault is 
detected in the other (this can be a fault in the card or in the 
connection to the network).
This is done in the physical level by some dual-homed comercial NIC, but 
it would cheaper and more flexible for many people to get the same 
results via software+two NIC.
Is there a way of doing this already?
An extension of this would be to have several cards to share a pool of 
IP addresses (for those applications were we want several IP addresses 
in one server). The IP addresses wouldn't need to be interface-specific 
and load-balancing and fault recovery would lead the reassignment of IP 
addresses from one interface to another.
I got this idea from "fake", which is a utility for a standby server to 
overtake the IP of a failing one.
Sorry you feel this is not related to Linux-kernel. If it is so, it 
would be appreciated to get a reference to a system administration linux 
list.
