The problem is that people are focusing on one feature here and forget 
about the rest. Targetted reclaim is one feature that was added later when 
lumpy reclaim was added to the kernel. The primary intend of this patchset 
was always to reduce the fragmentation. The name is appropriate and the 
patchset will support copying of objects as soon as support for that is 
added to the kick(). In that case the copying you are looking for will be 
there. The simple implementation for the kick() methods is to simply copy
pieces of the reclaim code. That is what is included here.

100%? I am so fond of these categorical statements ....
ZONE_MOVABLE also contains mlocked pages that are also not reclaimable. 
The question is at what level would it be possible to make them MOVABLE? 
It may take some improvements to the kick() methods to make eviction more 
reliable. Allowing the moving of objects in the kick() methods will 
likely get usthere.

Right. That would simplify the antifrag methods. Is there any way to 
measure the reclaim costs?

Right. We can defer this for now.
