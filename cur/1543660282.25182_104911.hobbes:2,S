Then we may want to have the actual implementation of the default iops
IOSYNC() for PIO & MMIO be arch specific. I would suggest nothing for
PIO on x86 and at least and mb() on others. For MMIO, then, we have the
choice of reading the alt status, or reading the dma_base if any.
Of course these are defaults, I expect controllers like ide-pmac to
implement their own IOSYNC.
That means that we must _both_ call IOSYNC and do the 400ns delay (I
don't trust reading alt status to be enough, especially on MMIO based
controlers, also, on ide-pmac, I plan to go read some other register
instead).
What do you think ?
Ben.
