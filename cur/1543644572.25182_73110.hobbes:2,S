The problem is that printks are very easy, people won't easily switch
to any other thing if it is hard to understand/use. If you can provide
such easy interface, then ok.
Regarding translation problem: it makes life easier to admins, i.e. you
enable Linux to be used by more stupid admins :-).
This race could not be won: Universe can always produce more remarkable
idiots. Next time they will ask you "what is eepro100?" and if you say
"it's a NIC, if you have intermittent link indicator problem try to reseat
network cord..." they will ask "what is NIC and how to reseat the cord?"
(btw, they will ask that in their native language). 8-(
Maybe requiring admins to know basic English is not that bad?
