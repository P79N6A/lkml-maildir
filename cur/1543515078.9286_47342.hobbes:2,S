After reading your question, and reading the responses I see that
nobody has tried to actually answer your question.  I most likely
would have taken a humorous answer as well, but it seems that you
have made an honest mistake.  Rather than point you towards what
is most likely NOT what you are looking for - as others have
done...
The LINUX kernel source code is available at:
    ^^^^^ 
http://www.kernel.org
or
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/
Good luck!
