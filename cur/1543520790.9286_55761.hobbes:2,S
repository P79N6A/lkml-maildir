Subject: Re: kernel 2.3.31 seems to busy wait for sleep < 2 msec, is this not a  bad idea?

Hi all,
There has been latency problems with this code...
(I do not have the 2.3.x kernels so I do not know the current state)
Since this busy wait is done in the kernel it will prevent
context switches to other higher priority RT processes.
Ingo Molnar found this an checks for 'need_resched' in the loop.
See
        
http://www.redhat.com/~mingo/lowlatency-2.2.13-A1
The current state of 2.3 as I understand it is:
- Some long execution paths have been removed by changing algorithm.
- Other places where that _can_not_ be done will be patched in the
  same way as for 2.2.13 (when other stuff has stabilized)
