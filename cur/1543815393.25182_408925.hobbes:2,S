The default values are infinitely better than mainline, but it is still
a huge improvement to reduce them (at least grace_g2) :
default : grace_g1=10, grace_g2=14400, loadavg oscillating between 7 and 12 :
willy@wtap:~$ time ls -la /data/src/tmp/|wc
   2271   18250  212211
real    0m5.759s
user    0m0.028s
sys     0m0.008s
willy@wtap:~$ time ls -la /data/src/tmp/|wc
   2271   18250  212211
real    0m3.476s
user    0m0.020s
sys     0m0.016s
willy@wtap:~$ 
I can still observe some occasionnal pauses of 1 to 3 seconds (once
to 4 times per minute).
- grace_g2 set to 0, load converges to a stable 8 :
willy@wtap:~$ time ls -la /data/src/tmp/|wc
   2271   18250  212211
real    0m0.441s
user    0m0.036s
sys     0m0.004s
willy@wtap:~$ time ls -la /data/src/tmp/|wc
   2271   18250  212211
real    0m0.400s
user    0m0.032s
sys     0m0.008s
I can still observe some rare cases of 1 second pauses (once or twice per
minute).
- grace_g2 and grace_g1 set to zero :
willy@wtap:~$ time ls -la /data/src/tmp/|wc
   2271   18250  212211
real    0m0.214s
user    0m0.028s
sys     0m0.008s
willy@wtap:~$ time ls -la /data/src/tmp/|wc
   2271   18250  212211
real    0m0.193s
user    0m0.032s
sys     0m0.008s
=> I never observe any pause, and the numbers above sometimes even
   get lower (around 75 ms).
I have also tried injecting traffic on my proxy, and at 16000 hits/s,
its does not impact overall system's responsiveness, whatever (g1,g2).

That would suit me perfectly. I think I would set them both to zero.
It's not clear to me what workload they can help, it seems that they
try to allow a sometimes unfair scheduling.
