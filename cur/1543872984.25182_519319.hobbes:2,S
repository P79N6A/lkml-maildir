OpenVZ wants to account _shared_ pages in a guest
different than separate pages, so that the RSS
accounted values reflect the actual used RAM instead
of the sum of all processes RSS' pages, which for
sure is more relevant to the administrator, but IMHO
not so terribly important to justify memory consuming
structures and sacrifice performance to get it right
YMMV, but maybe we can find a smart solution to the
issue too :)
