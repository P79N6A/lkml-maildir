Thanks -- the error I got for the "tar"-based images started as:

==========
Briefly, the make rpm-pagage options call "make install" and
"make modules_install".  Both attempt to install the kernel
for the "target" system onto the the "Build" system.  This isn't
desired as the "target" kernel won't even run on the "build"
system.
I could supply error listings, but it seems unneeded as it is
so easily reproduced.
I see JanB is on the making "tar" image, but how long ago was
building of the rpm stuff done?  Is it the case that the designer/writer
of that hasn't had time to make it work with the "O=" param?  Is
someone still actively maintaining those targets?
Ideally it would be good to be able to make an installable kernel
package as a non-root user.  The idea is to not need root-privs
except to install, right? :-)
