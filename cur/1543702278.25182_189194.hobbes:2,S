That's what I figured too.  It also seems like it has the lowest
probability of introducing PIO vs. DMA races, since you have to
explicitly change a read() call.
What about compatibility though?  How should the interface behave if
it's accessing a PCI-X device that happens to be in PCI mode?  Ideally,
we could add these calls in and introduce no penalty for platforms that
don't support it...
Thanks,
Jesse
