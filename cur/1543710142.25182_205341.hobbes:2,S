I tried applying to a BK tree (that was fresh as of a couple of hours
ago), and ignored the dm related changes, and it seemed to work ok after
I fixed up rejects in direct-io.c and blkdev.h (which didn't seem hard,
unless I'm missing something):
10 qla2200 fc controllers, 64 cpus, 112 disks
stock BK tree: ~43945 I/Os per second
w/Jens' patch: ~47149 I/Os per second
