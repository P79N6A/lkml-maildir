The line you picked is a critical bug fix. However, the patch also
contains code to handle new FW states. I would recommend you to apply
the whole patch.

  Okay, thanks.  Is it just the one-liner I picked out that's critical,
or is the whole "[Patch 1/6] megaraid_sas: FW transition and q size
changes" a critical fix?
  Please CC replies to me, as I'm not on the list.  Thanks.
