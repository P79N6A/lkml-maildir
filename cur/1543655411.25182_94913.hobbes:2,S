for me:
pros:
-----
1- it is really really more easier to implement than S4;
2- we can even have it with 2.4 kernels (it seems that it work without
the need of freezing processes, but I suspect that this statement
is 'wrong' by nature).
cons:
-----
1- it is much slower (especially at save time) than your swsusp;
2- end users must setup their systems (need to create a suspend partition,
or to keep a vfat partition as the really first one (/dev/hda1));
3- we use a bios function.  Actually, everything can happen...
That why I prefer swsusp at this time, or any other implementation of S4 (I
think about an implementation of S4 via LKCD).
Cheers,
