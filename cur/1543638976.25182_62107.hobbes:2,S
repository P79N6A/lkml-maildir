Well, if the hardware implementation would always be straight forward to 
what you know from PCs, it wouldn't be required to apply additional 
patches to the common code, but it would be easy to stay within the 
architecture specifics. Unfortunately it is not always that easy, by 
large related to virtualization issues ... not an excuse, but an 
explanation. Those not intending to use Linux on IBM's mainframes, and 
what's worth in this context its FCP support can safely ignore the SCSI 
related patch. Anybody else will need it - but you're welcome to show 
alternatives, I'm sure the folks having written the code do very much 
appreciate any guidance you can provide 'em getting to a nicer/cleaner 
implementation finding everybody's appreciation :-)
