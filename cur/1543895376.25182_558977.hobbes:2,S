POWER/PowerPC has an insanely broken bit numbering scheme, in
which the most significant bit has number 0 (or is it 1?),
and the least significant bit has number N-1 (or is it N?)
where N is number of bits in a word.
The fact that you refer to the top bits as 22-31 makes me
suspect that you haven't compensated for this quirk.
