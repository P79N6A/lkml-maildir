I may be able to make a file full of "adapters" if I
can figure out how to have a procedure that gets
called with parameters in registers, with it calling
conventional stuff. There used to be a macro, "asmlinkage"
that corrected the calling conventions for assembly-language
procedures. I will try to see what it did in some
older kernels. It got taken out of newer ones.
