Some architectures and branches are kept in Source control. Like sparc, xfs.
Also the complete kernel is available in bitkeeper. Linux does not see a
reason to have his version in the CVS. And since he is the only commiter it
is quite valid for him to choose the tool he wants to use.

It is is not your problem to merge them. Alan and Linus are doing that. And
they are fine without CVS. 
BTW: this discussion is very old, you should only start it, if you have new
facts :)
