Really? At least on x86 it tends to generate bigger code when 
block reordering is enabled because a jump forward and a jump
backward and a possible label alignment are bigger than just
a single jump forward. But then it doesn't make that much difference
because the compiler does it on its own for every block.
On x86-64 I keep it disabled because:
- it generates bigger code
- it makes the assembly code unreadable
- it doesn't seem to help that much on modern CPUs with good
branch prediction and big icaches anyways.
-Andi (who originally introduced likely/unlikely, but regrets it these
days because it's far overused and makes code uglier everywhere)
