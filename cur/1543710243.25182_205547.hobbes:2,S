  I'm trying to use the NVIDIA driver so I can play NWN and some other
games which won't run with the stock XFree (xserver-xfree86_4.3.0-5) 
driver.  When I run "make" in the NVIDIA_kernel directory I get alot of
undefined variables:
/lib/modules/2.6.4/build/include/asm/mpspec.h:20: error: `MAX_MP_BUSSES' undeclared here (not in a function)
/lib/modules/2.6.4/build/include/asm/mpspec.h:20: error: conflicting types for `mp_bus_id_to_type'
/lib/modules/2.6.4/build/include/asm/mpspec.h:8: error: previous declaration of `mp_bus_id_to_type'
/lib/modules/2.6.4/build/include/asm/mpspec.h:22: error: `MAX_IRQ_SOURCES' undeclared here (not in a function)
/lib/modules/2.6.4/build/include/asm/mpspec.h:24: error: `MAX_MP_BUSSES' undeclared here (not in a function)
/lib/modules/2.6.4/build/include/asm/mpspec.h:24: error: conflicting types for `mp_bus_id_to_pci_bus'
/lib/modules/2.6.4/build/include/asm/mpspec.h:12: error: previous declaration of `mp_bus_id_to_pci_bus'
/lib/modules/2.6.4/build/include/asm/mpspec.h:50: error: `MAX_APICS' undeclared here (not in a function)
And that's just for starters.  Does anyone know if there's a way to get
this to compile cleanly or is it SoL until a new driver is released
(running 1.0.4191 currently).
:wq!
