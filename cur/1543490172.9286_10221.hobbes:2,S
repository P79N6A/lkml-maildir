We tried user-land nfs with 2.2.x kernels but it is somehow broken with
regard to locking. When serving /usr from nfs, the only thing that would
lock (i.e. would not work any longer) was either netscape or the whole
machine depending on mount-options with regard to locking.
knfsd seems to have other problems. We experience loss of file-handles
for special files like /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 or /dev/printer rendering the
connected applications (X or lpd) useless.
We thought we could serve everything via nfs (like we did with
2.0.x-kernels), but this does not work anymore.
