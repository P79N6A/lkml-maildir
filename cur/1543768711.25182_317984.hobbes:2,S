Well you could just make a way to start writing data to the device
within 1s or so, and then assuming your device has a light indicating
activity (it better), then when the light has been off for a couple of
seconds, you can remove it.
I wish every removeable media drive had a soft eject button on it and a
locking mechanism like zip drive, jax drive, cdrom/dvd, mac floppy
drive, etc.  They are seriously needed to tell the os what the user is
trying to do to the poor media.  That way the os can see when the user
wants to take the media out, flush it, unlock and eject.  Doesn't help
if the eject button doesn't signal the OS of course, but at least on
some drives it does.  Being able to remove media from a system without
telling the OS first is just bad design.
