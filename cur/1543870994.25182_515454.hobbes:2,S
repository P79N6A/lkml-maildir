GIT v1.5.0.3 Release Notes
==========================
Fixes since v1.5.0.2
--------------------
* Bugfixes
  - 'git.el' honors the commit coding system from the configuration.
  - 'blameview' in contrib/ correctly digs deeper when a line is
    clicked.
  - 'http-push' correctly makes sure the remote side has leading
    path.  Earlier it started in the middle of the path, and
    incorrectly.
  - 'git-merge' did not exit with non-zero status when the
    working tree was dirty and cannot fast forward.  It does
    now.
  - 'cvsexportcommit' does not lose yet-to-be-used message file.
  - int-vs-size_t typefix when running combined diff on files
    over 2GB long.
  - 'git apply --whitespace=strip' should not touch unmodified
    lines.
  - 'git-mailinfo' choke when a logical header line was too long.
  - 'git show A..B' did not error out.  Negative ref ("not A" in
    this example) does not make sense for the purpose of the
    command, so now it errors out.
  - 'git fmt-merge-msg --file' without file parameter did not
    correctly error out.
  - 'git archimport' barfed upon encountering a commit without
    summary.
  - 'git index-pack' did not protect itself from getting a short
    read out of pread(2).
  - 'git http-push' had a few buffer overruns.
  - Build dependency fixes to rebuild fetch.o when other headers
    change.
* Documentation updates
  - user-manual updates.
  - Options to 'git remote add' were described insufficiently.
  - Configuration format.suffix was not documented.
  - Other formatting and spelling fixes.
