I decided to limit physical devices just because any limit on top of
virtual one is not correct. When system recharges bio from virtual
device to physical, and the latter is full, virtual device will not
accept any new blocks for that physical device, but can accept for
another ones. That was created specially to allow fair use for network
and physical storages.
