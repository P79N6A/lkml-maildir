Oh, OK. Damn, Andrew will hate us for breaking mouse support yet again :(
because there are people (like me) relying on hotplug to load input handlers.
First time I booted by new input hotplug kernel I lost my mouse.
I wonder should we hack something allowing overriding subsystem name
so we could keep the same hotplug agent? Or should we bite teh bullet and
change it?
