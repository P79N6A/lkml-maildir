It's a bit of a sledge hammer... Since get_user_pages() appears to work
on nummu, we can just disable the vmsplice-to-userspace bits and leave
the (working) vmsplice-from-userspace in place.
I'm reworking this code anyway in the block branches, so I'll update and
take CONFIG_MMU into consideration.
