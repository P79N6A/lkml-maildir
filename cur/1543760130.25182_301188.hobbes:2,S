I do not have such an instrumentation :-(

Sorry but i cannot understand this:
i'm trying to estimate interrupt latency (i need only the order of
magnitude) by measuring the interrupt latency of the timer interrupt.
So when the 8254 counter reaches zero it issues an interrupt so i'm
sure that the time when the interrupt has been issued was when the
counter was to zero. From that time the counter returns to a value of
19832 (or something else) and at that time the countdown restarts.
When i reach the ISR i read the counter and obtain the
latency...what's wrong in this simple strategy?
Probably  i'm guessing  that the latency experienced by a timer
interrupt is the same as e.g the latency experienced by a NIC
interrupt, but remember that i need only a coarse measure.
Nevertheless, the information about the ISR in cache is very
interesting, probably it's what i was looking for....thank u.
