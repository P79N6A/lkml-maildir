It was on .5GB machine, with X running, IIRC. Specify how should I
load the system and I'll try it here. swsusp1 got some speedups with
O(n^2) killing (not yet merged).

Ok, "I do not want suspend2 in kernel". Not what you'd call suspend2,
anyway. I thought that stripping down suspend2 then merging it is
reasonable way to go, but now it seems to me that enhancing swsusp1 is
easier way to go. At least I'll be able to do it incrementally.
I'm sorry about all the confusion, and you can still get that jpeg for
"put pavel into doom3".
