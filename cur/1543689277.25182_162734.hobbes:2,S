I must be missing something, the mount command from that file doesn't
seem to solve the original poster's problem, the /proc/bus/usb is still
empty...

I did the mount, checked that it worked, and the data still seems
missing. Before you ask, lc is an alias for "ls -CF" and a leftover
reflex from a previous o/s.
I did drag and drop on the mount command from the file you quote, o/s is
2.4.0-test4 with only Nick's v7 scheduler patch.
