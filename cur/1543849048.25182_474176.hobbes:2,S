Oh yes, absolutely.  That's why I posted it with a Nacked-by.

I don't see how that's possible.  If the driver forgets to call
pci_unblock_user_cfg_access(), that's a bug in the kernel driver.
The current user is limited to a two-second delay and the one I'm
proposing introducing is a delay measued in milli- or microseconds.
An extra two-second delay while you BIST your IPR device and change
modes in X at the same time (does X really scan all devices when it's
changing mode settings?  That's odd) doesn't strike me as a huge failure.

You fail the operation if it returns busy.  Or you loop.  It's really up
to you, the driver author.  You know what operation you're trying to do,
you know what makes more sense.

Absolutely not.  It's an attempt to solve a tricky problem.  Devfs, now
there was a cure looking for a disease.
It seemed to me there was consensus that blocking was a better approach
than returning a cached value or returning an error.  If we're
decided that returning a cached value is the better approach, then
the patch to fix it is trivial; move the pci_set_state() call from the
pci_block_user_cfg_access() function to the IPR driver.  Done and dusted.
