However, I do believe that all the currently supported compilers are able
to beat out any programmers over the long run - we can use asm tricks
to hand-tune very small sections of hot-spot code, but nobody can sustain
that level of hand-optimization for 10K or 20K lines of code.
Anybody thinking of this is almost surely better off spending their time
coming up with new and better algorithms.
