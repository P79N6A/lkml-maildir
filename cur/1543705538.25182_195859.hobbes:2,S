Skip that, it does work if SEQNUM is set :P
Anyhow, is it _really_ needed for SEQNUM to be set?  What about
the attached patch?
Then, order I have not really checked yet, but there are two things
that bother me:
1) latency is even higher than before (btw Greg, is there going to be
more sysfs/whatever fixes to get udev even faster, or is this the
limit?)
2) events gets missing.  If you for example use udevsend in the
initscript that populate /dev (/udev), the amount of nodes/links
created is off with about 10-50 (once about 250) entries.
Thanks,
