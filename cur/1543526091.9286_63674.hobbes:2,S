Peter! Friend! ;-)
I must say I agree. I would like to see /proc eventually have only
*process* information, and move all those device files in /proc to
devfs.
When I get the time, I'll be adding persistence to devfs (by
tunnelling through to the mounted-over FS). Right now devfsd provides
a hook to save permissions.
BTW: the microcode device should be in /dev/cpu/microcode. If you look
at the devfs patch, you'll notice that /dev/cpu/ is already defined.
