I am not suggesting this as a final solution but only as a temporary
workaround - if you need a very simple/stable ramdisk urgently, I wrote
this patch some time ago:
   
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/ramdisk-2.3.35-pre2.patch
This uses a simple vmalloc-on-demand allocation technique instead of
playing clever tricks with buffer cache as is done in the official tree at
the moment.
