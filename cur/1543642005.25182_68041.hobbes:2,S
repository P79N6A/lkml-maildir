Disk-backed raid config storage can do that just as well. I don't really 
think a partition table is the thing you'll want in order to store your 
raid config.

As mentioned -- there may still be bad hardware out there. And why can't 
the people just live with it? I mean you can't resize disks either. You 
could even assign a number of disks of different size to the users, and if 
one of them needs to get to another level of disk space, shall he. A pool 
of disks can save you resizes.

(I still wonder how often you resize your partitions, per second.)
I was talking about saving your time. And I've presented the theory of no 
partition tables on raid, which reduces the whole thing to backup work on 
PC, or few seeking on small disks, up to 200 GiB. Yes, currently.
