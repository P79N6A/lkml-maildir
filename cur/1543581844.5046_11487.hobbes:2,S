Maybe you're just being unreasonable for the sake of trolling.
Nobody is going to change this list to do [LKML], and this topic
comes up at least once every 6 months.  Matti and Dave run the
list and it has been stated it WILL NOT HAPPEN.
If you use procmail, you can filter lkml into a folder.  If you
want to have it in one folder, use the search feature of your
mailreader to sort by header line (Sender) or else use procmail
and formail to INSERT the [lkml] thing to the subject line
yourself.
procmail is installed on probably 99.9999999999999% of all
machines in existance.  If it isn't on yours and your employer
will not install it, I'll be REALLY surprised.
