Ugly, but yes. The "!page_table_present(mm, new_addr))" code just before
the "alloc_one_pte_map()" should already have done this, but while the 
page tables themselves are safe due to us holding the mm semaphore, the 
pte entry itself at "src" is not.
I hate that code, and your patch makes it even uglier. This code could do 
with a real clean-up, but for now I think your patch will do.
Thanks,
