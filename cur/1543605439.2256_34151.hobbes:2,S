Sounds good.

Or, just use autofs, it does pretty much what you're describing.

Actually, I don't have a hotplug envoronment, but that's not the only place
it would be useful.  Does ide/scsi have reliably unique device IDs?  If so,
once devfs gets rid of those races it would be very useful in a large raid
setup.  Hmm, I guess that could be hot-pluggable with high end hardware.

So is that in favor of changing the current ethX naming convention or not?

Everything, with all of the ids?  What about scsi/ide?
