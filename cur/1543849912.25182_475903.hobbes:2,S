YH.  I think the concept is sound.  I don't think this is a bug fix, just
an optimization so this may not be 2.6.19 material.  But we are thrashing
things so much it may make sense to include it, and it likely to keeps
us from running into problems, so it can be called a bug preventative :)
Beyond that I have a few nits to pick with the patch.
- We duplicate the code that claims a new vector which makes
  maintenance a pain.
- The comments are specific to phys_flat but the code is not.
- The test for being able to use the old_vector in the new domain
  should be: ...[old_vector] == vector || ...[old_vector] == -1
