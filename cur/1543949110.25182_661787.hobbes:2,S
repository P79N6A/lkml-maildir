btw., what are the technical reasons why ndiswrapper cannot be done in 
userspace, much like the (wildly successful) FUSE concept?
what's the main hardware access method of ndiswrapper - only PIO, or 
mmio as well? In the former case, ioperm() should work, in the latter 
case, mmap()ing the device aperture should work.
Frankly, it would be a great approach for the following reason: it would 
be _far_ easier for people to write a proper free driver, if the NDIS 
driver was in user-space, in a nicely debuggable, traceable, observable 
environment. I dont really see what the technical difficulties there are 
here.
