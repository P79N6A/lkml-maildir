As far as I can see, this hasn't changed in UNIX for the last 15 years.
If a parent process is root (either EUID or UID) forks, the child process
still has the same (EUID/UID) priveleges. If it execs another program, the
child still has the same priveleges (that of the greatest privelege).

Not on any system I have access to (Sun, Cray, SGI, and Linux).

Normal activity. Membership in a directory cannot determine wether a parent
directory is/is not root owned. Consider the case of a single disk system:
a user may establish a hard link to /bin/passwd. Now: is the parent directory
that the suid-root passwd program owned by root? There are now two parent
directories - one is owned by root, one is not. Both are valid.

This is normal.
