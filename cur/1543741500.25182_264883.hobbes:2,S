Well, it kinda works, but there are still some rough edges (the kbd
driver maps all the unknown keys to KEY_UNKNOWN, making them all to
have the same keycode in X, making them unusable. After removing the
test it forwards the events ok).
There are also problems because my sonypi input device acts both like
a mouse and a keyboard, and the X event driver wants them to be separate.
Vojtech: should I generate two different input devices in my driver,
a mouse like and a keyboard like device, or should the userspace be
able to demultiplex the events ?
Stelian.
