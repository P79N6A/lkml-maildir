Lately I've been running the development kernels, and the last few
(since 2.3.43, maybe 42) there seems to be a bug affecting lilo - if i run
lilo while running the devel kernel, my comp won't boot. It seems to be
looking in the wrong spot for the kernel - lilo itself is starting
fine. If I boot of a bootdisk and run lilo, everything works fine. I'm not
on the list (used to be, but not enough time lately) so cc everything to
kent_overstreet@hotmail.com
