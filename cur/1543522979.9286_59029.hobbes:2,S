Heh.  And people think that I'm stupid/wimpy when I do things like that.  While I do
agree with what you said, I knew that I would have to say so at the beginning without
any possible contradictions to get attention.  Glad you have the patience to deal with
a youngin' like me (only 24 :).

Sounds familiar.  They keep wanting me to work on Tru64...<smirk>

Interesting papers.  A former IBMer coworker suggested something like that just the
other day from his mainframing days.

That shouldn't be too biggie of a deal.  The question I'd think becomes one of
cross-CPU consistency traffic as with locks.  We still write data which someone else
may or may not have mapped in their cache.  Conceptually, tho', seeing as we would all
map the same memory (probably the same way) at some sort of offset (our per-N-cpu
kernel base), we should be able to touch memory that we share without extra cost.
How should we handle the entrance into the kernel from user space?  I don't want each
user space process over on CPUs 28-32 having to bounce their request through the base
kernel located down at CPU 0.  A simple loader trick, perhaps (kinda like we adjust our
shared library locations)?  I'm somewhat talking out of my arse as I haven't thought
all of this completely through yet.  (Then again, I'm accused of doing that anyway,
so... ;)

It sounds interesting.  It will also be very interesting to work with this type of
setup on a NUMA machine where I believe this type of setup is pretty much requisite to
achieve any real performance (especially if the page replication/migration engines
aren't in the hardware).  If more than just the two of us are interested, I'd recommend
setting up the list.  I'd say a very cool project overall, if nothing else.
