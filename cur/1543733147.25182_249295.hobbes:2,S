I'm using staircase exclusively, but I did compare it to vanilla kernel's 
scheduler and yes the interactivity is very good (I'm running x.org and KDE 
3.2.3 here).
I have had no sound skips or tvtime problems no matter what kind of disk IO 
was being done, which includes MySQL database updates, cron scripts (running 
rpm -V on all packages) and wwwoffle purging cached files (note I use the 
default as IO sched). Also kernel compilation is no threat to interactivity 
with staircase.
I'm a Mandrake user and since the release of Mandrake 10 it does not renice X 
server to higher priority so I guess Nick's scheduler would force me to tweak 
X startup script.
The other things I like about staircase are that it gives you kernel.compute 
and kernel.interactive sysctls that allow to perform serious computational 
tasks with it. Also ability to use scheduling policies with schedtool is a 
great plus, for example using SCHED_BATCH for cpu bound applications like 
seti@home or folding@home.
Overall staircase has been a great experience for me.
