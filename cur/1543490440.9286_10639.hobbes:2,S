There is a lot of misunderstanding going round about GPL and other
licenses. First of all, any code you write completely without using
other people's code you can license any way you want -- including GPL
-- even if it needs proprietary non redistributable libraries. This
has been hashed out in the past with respect to Motif and other
stuff. (For Motif there is an explicit permission from the FSF under
the system library clause).

Here you are using GPLed code from somebody else so the problem
begins.

I'm far from an expert on the vagaries of NT but I thought tools could 
create a .lib from a .dll automagically. I even believe such a beast
exists in the Cygwin distribution.

I think you should.
