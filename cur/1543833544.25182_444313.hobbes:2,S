Ok ;-), I did what you told me and there is patch agains 
2.6.17-hrt-dyntick5
which enables clocksource and clockevent for ixp4xx. There were
some changes in common code to be able to compile it for arm, I'm
not sure If these changes are correct, can you please check this out?
I tested it with my nanosleep test program and got beautiful
results - differency between requested and real time of sleep
is stable around 30us.
Important thing is to use IXP4XX_OST_ONE_SHOT! Without this set, results
are as bad as I reported previously...
I'm trying to fix -rt to use this, but interface has been changed and I
don't know hot to switch hrtimers to use one-shots. It looks like it wants
to always use cyclic timers...
The bad thing is that I tested it also using timer_create with 
CLOCK_REALTIME
and the best what I got was 100 tick per sec... I'll try to find where is 
problem.
