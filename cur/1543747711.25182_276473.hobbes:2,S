Thanks Gerrit for mentioning this :)
Just an additional information -- the tool used to get this reporting
system is OSS and can be found here:
http://tslogparser.sourceforge.net
This tool is not mature yet, but it gives an overview of how useful a
test suite can be, when the results are easy to analyse...
It currently supports only the Open POSIX Test Suite, but I'd be happy
to work to enlarge the scope of this tool.
Regards, 
Seb.
