  Remember: if another thread can find your data structure, and you don't
  have a reference count on it, you almost certainly have a bug.

+		Chapter 9: Organization
+
+Writing efficient code is important in both complexity and
+implementation.  In other words your code organization should NOT be
+too complex to understand.  Complexity directly depends on the choice
+of data representation and code organization.  To help you stay in
+line, here are a few guidelines to follow:
+
+      Modularize.
+      Use subroutines.
+      Each subroutine/module should do one thing well.
+      Make sure every module/subroutine hides something.
+      Localize input and output in subroutines.
+
+And the most important:
+
+    Choose the data representation that makes the program simple.
