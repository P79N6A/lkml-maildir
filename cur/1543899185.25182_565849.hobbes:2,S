Now it's too late -- getcpu() has infected the kernel everywhere.
It would have made sense a few years ago.

Hmm ok, although i suspect it's rare to assume that. But understood
you don't want to audit all getcpu users because of this.

Sorry, that's totally bogus. Primarily because the access would be directly
on memory and there is no partial register tracking there.
Besides pipeline stall is not the correct description on what would
happen if you used a register, the worst you get is a single false dependency
but no pipeline flush.
Besides the latest x86 cpus (C2, K8) don't have much trouble with these
false dependencies in general.
