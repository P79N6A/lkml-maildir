I have 8-port board, but mxser creates 16 devices anyway, and forces any
application accessing one of those inexistent devices to segfault, e.g.:
osv@osv ~$ cat /dev/ttyM9
Segmentation fault
osv@osv ~$
This is on 2.6.14 kernel though, -- didn't try with more recent kernels
as I have other troubles with them on my hardware/distribution.
Not a big deal, but you've asked yourself ;)
