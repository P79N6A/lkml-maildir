You doing than I am on my S580p.
if AHCI is loaded, damn thing will not turn off.  Goofy part is, another 
Sony S80p at work does NOT have this probelm - same bios, same drive 
firmware.
Suspend to disk mostly works - sometimes when you return, the screen is 
kinda wonky.
Suspend to ram - going in appears to work, coming out it's dead.
