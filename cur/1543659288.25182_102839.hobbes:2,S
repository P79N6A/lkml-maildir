Once the root account has been compromised, it is 'Game Over' no
matter what you do. Kerberos or no Kerberos, the simplest way to steal
your identity is simply for the attacker to listen in on your tty
while you are typing your password.
The RPCSEC_GSS security model is not meant to protect you against root
monitoring. It is meant to prevent some third party (on another
machine for instance) from spoofing RPC requests in you name (==
strong authentication), intercepting valid RPC requests and modifying
the payload (== cryptographic data integrity checking), or listening
in on the client/server communication (== data privacy).
