If your desire is for the compiler warnings output to be unchanged, I'm 
not sure how you'd enhance the compiler from detecting these casts.  All 
of the casts that have been removed in these cleanup patches do not change 
the assembly when using gcc; they simply reduce the amount of visual noise 
in the source code.
This is also true in terms of global static variables being initialized to 
0 (or NULL).  While it is indeed unnecessary by the standard, it simply 
moves the initialization from one segment of the assembly to the other, 
regardless of how many different functions it is referenced in.  gcc does 
not emit movl $0, var for these cases.
It _would_ be helpful to add a macro such as:
	#define	SILENCE_GCC(x)	= x
to eliminate warnings such that:
	auto int a SILENCE_GCC(a);
	fill_a(&a);
	if (a)
		...
would not produce a "may be used uninitialized" warning.
