I've had the same problem with three uniprocessor boxes under
2.4.0-test*. The fix was to make four changes to drivers/net/eepro100.c:
(line numbers are 2.2.16 / 2.4.0-test5)
line 48/36: change value of txfifo from 8 to 15
line 49/37: change rxfifo from 8 to 15
line 79/60: change TX_RING_SIZE from 32 to 64
line 80/61: change RX_RING_SIZE from 32 to 64
This has fixed the problem on all of my boxes, and I have noticed no side
effects.
I also tested one of my boxes (Asus K7M, Athlon 500, 2 eepro100) under
2.2.16, and found that the same solution works there.
