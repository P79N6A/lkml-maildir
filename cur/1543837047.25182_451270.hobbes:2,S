A last sentence...
I forgot the most important point that could make all others obsolete:
4)
Vendors don't care about Linux yet.
For laptops I know two vendors who eventually would fix their BIOS (for
special models, HP and Lenovo) and provide a BIOS update for customers.
If we could convince those to at least validate their BIOSes with Intel
ACPICA in some way, most stuff described in point 2 would not happen.
Hopefully Novell has more influence here than SUSE had to make at least
the big players take more care about Linux support. I think it's getting
better...
I hope those who never used ACPICA and ignored any "Could you please
switch this byte for us in AML code" cries from Linux customers will get
punished with incompatibility with newer M$ ACPI interpreters at some
time and will be forced to provide last minute updates and I hope it
hurts.
