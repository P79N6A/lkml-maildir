Nope you rely on cs & ds as well.  cs is just a duh the codes running
so it must be valid.  But ds is needed for lgdt.

I need to retract this a bit.  You are still building a compressed image,
and the code in the boot/compressed/head.S remains unchanged and loads
segment registers, so it works by luck.  If you didn't build a
compressed image you would be in trouble.

Add a target for a noncompressed image and then build.  It should be
interesting to watch.

Nope because what I was complaining about is in 32 bit mode. :)

Hmm.  I'll have to look and see if FS & GS are also ignored.

Cool I like this bit.  The segments are finally dead.

Nope.  Though I suspect we should do the switch to 64bit mode in
setup.S and not have these issues pollute head.S at all.
