We don't know. But since we don't have their source and they have our
source only they can tell you.

Possibly, but you'll have to ask Nvidia to debug it for you. If you can
reproduce a bug by 
	-	removing the nvidia modules so they wont be loaded
	-	hard booting the machine
	-	triggering the bug without loading the nvidia drivers
then please report it. If not, its between you and nvidia.
