Very true - if it's a L3 router, it needs that IP address so you have something
to use as a 'next hop' when you try to send to it.  If it doesn't have an IP
address, it's a L2 switch/hub and you pretty much *don't* want to talk to it
at all (except to an IP set up as a "management" address, but then you're
talking to it as a host, of course)...
I *think* cranium2003 wanted to do different things depending on whether
the 'next hop addr == dest addr', but I'm failing to see any cases where
you'd want to do that....
