Subject: [PATCH] Disable scheduler debugging
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The domain scheduler spews out a lot of information at boot up, but it looks
mostly redundant because it's just a transformation of what is in /proc/cpuinfo
anyways. Also it is well tested now. Disable it.
