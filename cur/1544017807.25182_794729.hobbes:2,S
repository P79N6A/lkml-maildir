That might be tough for you to do, as it's in every 2.6.29-rc1 release
out there.  That's a lot of ssh and sed commands needed for you to do :)

It meets the drivers/staging/ requirements of:
	- it builds
	- it is self-contained
	- someone is using it
Well, some of the stuff in drivers/staging/ don't even meet the first
requirement, making this one of the better drivers :)

No, not at all, I commited the tarball I was given, after shoehorning it
into the kernel build system.

Yes.

Pretty much.  Know of any other drivers that should go into here that
are floating around in the wild?
Is this a problem?
Is the drivers/staging/ area just not properly documented for people to
understand what is going on there and how it differs from the rest of
the kernel?  Should I write up something a bit more "formal"?
