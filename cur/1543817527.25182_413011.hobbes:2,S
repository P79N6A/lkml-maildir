I suppose you could argue that the "platform-ness" is related to the fact
that a gadget is a sort-of synthetic device, made up entirely of software.  
Not very convincing, I admit.
The real reason for wanting to use the platform bus is because USB gadgets
don't really belong anywhere else, and the platform bus is supposed to be
(among other things) the bus for devices that don't have a home of their
own.  It took over that role from the old "misc" bus, or whatever it used
to be called.
Of course, there's always the possibility of creating a "usb-gadget" bus
-- but that really would be going over the top!
