There's a new patchset against 2.6.25-rc6 at:
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.25-rc6/patches/
It contains some more patches, specifically the "legacy PM removal" series, the
fixed "PM: make wakeup flags available whenever CONFIG_PM is set" series posted
recently by Alan (the second patch rebased by me), the Johannes' apm-emulation
patch and the patches introducing the new suspend/hibernation callbacks I sent
yesterday.

Also, patches 05-06 are upstream (in the Greg's tree).
Everything has been compiled and (lightly) tested on HP nx6325 and Asus L5D
(both 64-bit).
Thanks,
