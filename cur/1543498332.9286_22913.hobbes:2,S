Personally, I counted 24 instances of fuck, many more of shit, damn,
bitch, or deritives thereof (fucking, shitty, damnit or dammit, etc).
I think it could be an issue as far as censorship of the language goes,
but nothing more than a minor inconvience.
BTW, just run "grep -rn fuck *" or whatever word your looking for, while
in /usr/src/linux and it will tell you the filename and line number of
each instance along w/ the line.
