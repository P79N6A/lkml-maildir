Up in the middle of the night, bored so I thought I'd build a new kernel 
2.6.22-rc3 before I got too far behind.
These errors were output after a make oldconfig had been done, followed by a 
make xconfig:
drivers/macintosh/Kconfig:116:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'PMAC_APM_EMU' refers to undefined symbol 'SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION'
drivers/net/Kconfig:2283:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'UCC_GETH' 
refers to undefined symbol 'UCC_FAST'
drivers/input/keyboard/Kconfig:170:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'KEYBOARD_ATARI' refers to undefined symbol 'ATARI_KBD_CORE'
drivers/input/mouse/Kconfig:182:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'MOUSE_ATARI' refers to undefined symbol 'ATARI_KBD_CORE'
A make bzImage then spit this out:
scripts/kconfig/conf -s arch/i386/Kconfig
drivers/macintosh/Kconfig:116:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'PMAC_APM_EMU' refers to undefined symbol 'SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION'
drivers/net/Kconfig:2283:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'UCC_GETH' 
refers to undefined symbol 'UCC_FAST'
drivers/input/keyboard/Kconfig:170:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'KEYBOARD_ATARI' refers to undefined symbol 'ATARI_KBD_CORE'
drivers/input/mouse/Kconfig:182:warning: 'select' used by config 
symbol 'MOUSE_ATARI' refers to undefined symbol 'ATARI_KBD_CORE'
Other than the usual 'deprecated' suspects, the rest of the build proceeded 
nominally.  As did the reboot to it, and the first time install of the latest 
nvidia drivers from their .run file.
I purposely chose 'SLUB' and the new firewire stack.  SLUB bears watching I 
suppose, but how?
The firewire stack will get checked out later by my movie camera, a Sony 
TVR-460.
