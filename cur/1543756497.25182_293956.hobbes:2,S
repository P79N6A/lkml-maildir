Hi,
On my embedded system, I'm using the kernel2.6.10 plus the libata patch
2.6.11 of Mister Garzik.
In little endian mode, all is ok i.e all my hdd connected on the
controller
SATA (Promise PDC20371 or PDC20579) are recognized.
Unfortunately when I switch to big endian mode, my hdd are no more
recognized and I get message such as "dev 0 not supported, ignoring" or
just
"no device found" !
Does everyone encouter such a problem ? And do you find a solution :) ?
Thanks
David Sanchez
