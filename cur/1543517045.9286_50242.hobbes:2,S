I've done some more tests:
Without ipnatctl & iptables rules (i.e. only one NIC configured) and 
traffic shaping (cbq) turned on, the system is stable.
With masquerading & forwarding/accounting & traffic shaping (cbq), the system
crashes within a few minutes. The same configuration without traffic shaping
is stable again. Wether ipip-tunneling is used or not does not seem to
change this.
Based on these results one could conclude that the netfilter code clashes
with traffic shaping.

The debug noise is now reduced to a repetitive:

Kernel used was 2.3.26.
