Interesting implementation of resource controls. Cross posting this 
to ckrm-tech as well. I am sure CKRM folks have something to say...
Any thoughts about how you want to add more resource control features
on top of/in addition to this setup. (Such as memory etc)

I agree with Paul here. You would want to build your controllers
on top of exclusive cpusets to keep things sane.

I think it makes more sense to add this functionality directly as part
of the existing cpusets instead of creating further leaf cpusets (or subcpusets
as you call it) where we can specify resource control parameters. I think that 
approach would be much more intuitive and simple to work with rather than 
what you have currently.
