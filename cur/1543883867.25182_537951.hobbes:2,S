Doubtful. The Tseng ET4000 cards may have been the gold standard in 1991, 
but I don't think most people even _remember_ them. And if they have them 
in their machines, they probably tend to run a Linux-1.2 kernel, or at 
least not care a lot about graphics (ie they may have an old card in the 
machine just because they need VGA to boot, rather than because they care 
about Tseng).
And compared to Tseng and S3, most of the other cards there are just 
obscure.
