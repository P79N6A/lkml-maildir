Hi,
Ever since I upgraded from 2.4.20 to the 2.6 tree, I've had a problem
with real-time clock slippage and hard hangs on my Athlon XP 2500+
(1830MHz according to /proc/cpuinfo).  I've kept an eye on the list and
have applied new patches as the problem seems to be known about, but as
the problem's still there with 2.6.2 I thought it was about time I
reared my ugly head.
At or shortly after boot time, I get the "Losing too many ticks!"
message (this seems to be related to how hard the system is working --
if it runs an fsck, the message appears immediately).  Then, while the
system is running, the real-time clock will lose time: the more jobs use
the CPU, the more time I lose.  Occasionally, the system will oops or
hard-hang altogether (which could be an unrelated driver issue; it is
pretty unusual).
I'm willing to test any patches you clever folk want to throw at me, or
alternatively if there's an easy solution I'll try anything.
Please cc: me on any replies, as my phone line is made of wet string and
would never cope with being subscribed!
Thanks for any help
- Ian
