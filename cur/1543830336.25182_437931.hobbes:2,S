It is not that bad. Instead of preempt_disable/preempt_enable we need a
spinlock. Then only one cpu can do this particular smp_call_function
which will "stop" all other cpus until cap->done has been set.

Not good enough. An instruction can be fetched multiple times for a
single execution (see the other mail). So you have a half executed
instruction, the cache line is invalidated, a new instruction is written
and the cache line is recreated to finished the half executed
instruction. That can easiliy happen on millicoded instructions.

That the cache line is invalidated does not mean that you are safe..

The serialization is indeed done by the smp_call_function(). No need to
have a "bcr 15,0" in the called function, the lpsw at the end of the
interrupt already does the serialization.
