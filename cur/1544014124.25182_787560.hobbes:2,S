OK here is an update. It does not change anything to turn off any acceleration
feature on the interface (tg3) :
root@wtap:~# ethtool -k eth0
Offload parameters for eth0:
rx-checksumming: off
tx-checksumming: off
scatter-gather: off
tcp segmentation offload: off
It still forwards corrupted data like mad. I noticed that the corruption rate
is 10-100 times higher when forwarding from eth0 to eth0 than from eth0 to lo.
Maybe this can help find the culprit ?
