You miunderstand the code -
cn_netlink_send() never ends up in callback invocation, 
it can only deliver messages in kernelspace->userspace direction.
kernelspace->userspace direction ends up adding buffer into
socket queue, from which userspace may read data using recv() system
call.
There is no kernelspace->kernelspace sending possibility 
except by creating new socket in userspace and sendmsg/recvmsg 
interception/using, but that is the same as reading from userspace.
