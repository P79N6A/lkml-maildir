I confess that I had thought about doing it purely at the "bus glue" level
rather than as a new HCD method, but having an HCD method for this does make
sense in terms of simpler code in HCDs that cope with more than one kind of
bus glue.  (And I'd forgotten that OHCI needs a third type, because of that
SA1111 "minibus".)
