In my experience, if kernel has no support for your particular IDE
chip compiled in, you will likely be unable to get [u]dma working.
However, I have one hd which refuses to do dma even with proper support 
compiled in (I have PIIX IDE). All I can do is
# hdparm -c1 -A1 -W1 /dev/hda
and get 8mb/s in
# hdparm -T -t /dev/hda
