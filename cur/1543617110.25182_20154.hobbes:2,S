Readers of this list may recall my previous postings about problems
I've been having with UDMA in 2.4.x.  E.g., see starting at

or just search for "Kamens" in the lkml archives.
FYI, Alan Cox recently suggested that I try 2.4.18-pre3-ac2 to see if
it does any better, and indeed so far with that kernel I haven't
experienced any of the problems I reported previously.
