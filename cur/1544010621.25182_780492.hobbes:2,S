Which BIOS ? Mine is 3304, kernel is 2.6.28-rc8, and LEFT card is not detected
unless I use this option:
options sdhci debug_quirks=1
I have downloaded BIOS 3308, but it is to big to fit in my 1.4 floppy image
(I still have a flooy image I dd on a USB flash, but have not managed to grow
it - wouldn't you know how to do it ?)
