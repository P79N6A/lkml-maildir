I decided to write devfs after I heard/read about other alternatives
and decided they didn't measure up.
And I deny that there are problems specific to the devfs approach.
Those "problems" (i.e. persistence) also exist with a disc-based
dynamic /dev, where you lose persistence information when a device
node is deleted after a driver or device is removed.
The current tar solution is indeed a hack. But that's not a problem
with devfs. And besides, a more elegant solution is in the pipeline.

Strange. There are plenty of people with big systems or unusual
configurations that use devfs precisely because it just "happens" to
fit them.
And with devfsd, there is enormous scope for configurability. So it's
not a "one size fits all" solution. Have a closer look and you'll see
that.
