I really wish Marcelo would do this or someone would volunteer to clean
up the change log comments.  BitKeeper doesn't have an easy way to 
propogate changes to the checkin comments (they are not currently 
revision controlled).  However, you can change them and someone could
clean up all the crud in the 2.4 tree and we could replace the one
on bkbits with a cleaned up one.
