And a compiler that makes a_variable.flag unsigned would be brain-dead 
because "int" is always signed.  The signed specifier is only useful for 
forcing chars to carry a sign and it's redundant with any other types.  
Using bitfields requires the knowledge of the sign bit in twos-complement 
just like when you use a signed qualifier for any other definition.  
Having inconsistent behavior on whether it is unsigned or signed based on 
how large the bitfield is (i.e. one bit compared to multiple bits) is 
inappropriate.
