So can we please do swap over network storage only first?  All these
VM bits look conceptually sane to me, while the changes to the swap
code to support nfs are real crackpipe material.   Then again doing
that part properly by adding address_space methods for swap I/O without
the abuse might be a really good idea, especially as the way we
do swapfiles on block-based filesystems is an horrible hack already.
So please get the VM bits for swap over network blockdevices in first,
and then we can look into a complete revamp of the swapfile support
that cleans up the current mess and adds support for nfs insted of
making the mess even worse.
