We used gzip when we first implemented compression support, and found it
to be far too slow. Even with the fastest compression options, we were
only getting a few megabytes per second. Perhaps I did something wrong
in configuring it, but there's not that many things to get wrong!
In contrast, with LZF, we get very high throughput. My current laptop is
an 1.8MHz Turion with a 7200 RPM (PATA) drive. Without LZF compression,
my throughput in writing an image is the maximum the drive & interface
can manage - 38MB/s. With LZF, I get roughly that divided by compression
ratio achieved, so if the compression ratio is ~50%, as it generally is,
I'm reading and writing the image at 75-80MB/s. During this time, all
the computer is doing is compressing pages using LZF and submitting
bios, with the odd message being send to the userspace interface app via
netlink. I realise this is very different to the workload you'll be
doing, but hopefully the numbers are somewhat useful:

Oh, I also have a debugging mode where I can get Suspend2 to just
compress the pages but not actually write anything. If I do that, it
says it can do 80MB/s on my kernel image, so the disk is still the
bottleneck, it seems.
Hope this all helps (and isn't information overload!)
