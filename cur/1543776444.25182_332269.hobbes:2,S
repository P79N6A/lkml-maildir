nothing at all, no multiplexing controller and most important only 2
ports
PNP: No PS/2 controller found. Probing ports directly.
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1

Well it's pretty hard to say currently I've only been able to trigger
this problem only twice in at least 6 cold boots.
