Subject: [PATCH 0/3] exterminate strtok

In 1999 Ingo Oeser commented in lib/string.c :
   * -  Added strsep() which will replace strtok() soon (because strsep() is
   *    reentrant and should be faster). Use only strsep() in new code, please.
Then in 2002 strtok was removed.
There are still a few cases of strtok in the kernel to this day. The following
3 patches exterminates them.
Let me say up front that the first two patches have *not* been tested since I 
lack both the appropriate hardware and suitable cross compiler. They are fairly 
simple though, so I doubt they'll be troublesome, but I'd greatly appreciate if
someone else would validate them and sign off on them before I send them on to 
Andrew for inclusion in -mm.  The third patch /has/ seen limited testing, but it
would still be nice to have someone look it over and sign off on it.
