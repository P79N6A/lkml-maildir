Hi all,
	I am facing a problem while scheduling by a task queue.
	I have a character driver running well on Linux 2.2.2.
	I do a tq_immediate in the isr.
	I do another tq_immediate in the bottom half.
	When the same code is ported onto Linux 2.0.36, I get the error :
	 "Aiee:Scheduling in interrupt"
	There is no memory allocation being done in the isr.
	Instead of tq_immediate, I also tried tq_scheduler, but the
	same result.
	Please any inputs.
	Thanks,
	Prasanna Gokhale
