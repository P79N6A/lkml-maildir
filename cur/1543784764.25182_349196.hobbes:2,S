OK. Perhaps it's time to lay out the arguments so far
and see where we go from there :).
I want to pass a cs table in as platform data because
it means you don't have to know what bus number the
adapter is (which you can't easily tell for
hotplugable devices) and for most cases I think the
SPI devices will be hardwire to the adapter. This
approach of defining a structure to be used in
platform_data seems to be used by some serial drivers
so I think it's OK, but your not so sure.
How else could I do it? I could use driver_data but
that seems an even worse solution :(.
You want to pass in SPI devices in a table that gets
registered with the subsystem and when the adapter
that they sit on gets registered (known by the bus
number) all the devices in that table get registered
in the core. I like this solution for registering
hotplug'ish devices :), although I would prefer to use
the bus_id then a bus number. This solution doesn't
work very well for hotplug adapters as you don't know
what bus number they will be given (you would have to
do some undefined sysfs magic). 
So how would you feel about the core supporting both
cs tables as platform data and SPI device tables?

Sorry, I must be missing something here but isn't a
".so" a shared library not a kernel module? Or where
you only building it as a ".so" to find the text size?
