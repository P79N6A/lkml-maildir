I have just started working with the PCI-E BCM4311 that is in my new computer. It receives data OK,
but there is something wrong with the DMA out stuff in bcm43xx-softmac - at least for x86_64. All
the slots get full but nothing is ever transmitted. FWIW, the wireless-dev git tree works. I'm using
it for communications now. I'm using openSUSE 10.2 which uses NetworkManager to configure my WPA-PSK
TKIP encrypted network. The signal strengths are roughly the same as I got for my old BCM4306 card.
I will post any fixes for the DMA problem as soon as they are available, but it may be a while. I
will be off-line until Thursday while I attend a funeral.
