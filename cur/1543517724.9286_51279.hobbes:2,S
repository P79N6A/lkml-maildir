Hi people
Why did you not kick off the old 32-bit field bottom halves? They are only a
shame.  If you continue doing things like this, Linux will become
heritage-loaded like Pentium is heritage-loaded by the old heritage of 8086.
The scheduler is slower due to additional test for the old ones.
Yes, you are only hunting features...
Best regards,
Karel Kulhavy
