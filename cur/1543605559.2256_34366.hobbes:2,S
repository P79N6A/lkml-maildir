Well, it is not a question of moving X or Office into Kernel Space. But
current development clearly shows, that some things like Video Card Access
need Kernel Support. IMHO the Amount of GDI related Functions in NT Kernel
are too much, but X11 is not exactly the Windowing System you can consider
well suited for Desktop and Game Use.
