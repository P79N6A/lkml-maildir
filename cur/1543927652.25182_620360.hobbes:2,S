Hi,
I have a rather nasty situation developing on one of the big 24x7 
production database servers. It seems that a batch of drives in one of the
servers started to fail. 
The file servers are ext3fs on a top of raid-0 over a pair of raid-1 mirrors, 
with each of raid-1 mirrors having two drives. The issue is that all four 
drives are developing errors. 
Is there a way to determine what files are affected if I know the LBA# of the
errors on individual drives?
It is running under 2.6.20.x series of kernels.
Alex
