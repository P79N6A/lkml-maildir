Subject: Strange chmod behavior on 2.2.16 with write_inode()

I use write_inode() instead of notify_change() to set permissions in the
vfs.  According to /usr/src/linux/Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt, if
a file system driver does not implement notify_change(), the vfs will
default the call to write_inode().  
I am seeing a case on 2.2.16 where chmod 444 * does not propogate the
inode call to write_inode() in some cases.  If someone uses
write_inode() instead of notify_change() in their vfs implementation,
could there be a case where chmod won't make it as a write_inode() call
into the file system driver.  I never see a call to write inode in
certain cases, and the file attributes don't seem to get changed.
