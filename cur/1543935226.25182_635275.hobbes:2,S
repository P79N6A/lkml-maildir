Hi Dhaval,
Could you give more details of your setup?  I'm trying to figure out 
exactly what it is in kexec that goes goofy, but there seems to be an 
enormous number of codepaths, all different, depending on things like 
which kind of kernel.  The more closely I can replicate your failure, 
the quicker I should be able to locate the problem.
