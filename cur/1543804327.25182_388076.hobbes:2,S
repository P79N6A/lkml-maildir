This is pretty old stuff. The files in arch/m68k/fpsp040/
implement all the extra 68881/68882 instructions that they
left out of the FPU that is builtin on the 68040. This is
the official Motorola provided implementation of them, and
they seem to be widely available.  I have no idea on the
license issues, however. One thing to note is that there is
a README file in that directory that appears to be part of
the original distribution of this code from Motorola with
some license info.
