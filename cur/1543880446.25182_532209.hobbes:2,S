This is getting away from the intent of Kyle's original patch
(Which I think is worthwhile fwiw, having recently hit the exact
 same sata_nv bug that prompted him to write it)

The problem I see with such a 'one mkinitrd to rule them all', is that
it would suffer from the same thing that stopped any vendor stepping
up and getting behind hpa's klibc project...  Apathy due to "our current
stuff works, why would we throw it all away and start again"
It's a great idea in theory, in practise however, initrd construction
for every distro now contains years of custom hacks and workarounds
(that may not even be relevant on other distros).
Given the critical nature of mkinitrd (get something wrong, and your
system doesn't boot), unsurprisingly, people are reluctant to change
away from something they're familar with, unless there's a *really*
compelling reason.
