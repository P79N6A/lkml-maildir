I just looked briefly at the 'cvs server' protocol.  It looks fairly easy 
to have a 'keepalive' session with a server where multiple diffs of 
multiple files are requested.  This isn't a 5 minute fix though, but I've 
been bothered by the RTT per file as well, because we use 'ssh' to 
authenticate cvs access here, and each file is a complete ssh handshake 
which is very slow.

Already fixed in my code.  I won't bother you with a diff.

Thanks for your support,
