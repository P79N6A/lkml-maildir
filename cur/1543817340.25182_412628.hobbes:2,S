This is probably a classic example of a sucky name leads to confusion.
There are smp_mb_ in the name, however, the semantics is really defined
as a one-way memory barrier and probably is the main reason of contention
in this discussion :-(
Another good reason to get rid of this silly smp_mb_before/after_clear_bit.

wrong confusing implementation
