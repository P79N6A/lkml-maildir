Thanks for the clarification.  But I remain utterly perplexed.
I've installed JRE and JDK 1.5 in 1GB box here, I've installed
Tomcat 5.0.28, I've inserted the options from your strace (notably
the -Xmx768m) in my catalina.sh, yet I see no such problem with 2.6.16.9.

Bizarre indeed.  But at least you've rechecked and banished my doubts.

The second one, that's _OPT, yes, which just shaves a little off the
3GB userspace, to avoid the need for HIGHMEM.

The first one, this is the traditional layout, the one least likely to
give you any compatibility troubles, so please do stick with it for now.

They would, a little.  Whether it's noticeable, I don't know.
You might prefer to keep a similar configuration for all your
machines.  While we're investigating this particular mystery,
I'd prefer you to stick with what you've got.

Clearly I was entirely wrong to accuse you of the wrong VMSPLIT.
Yet I still can't see how either shm or mprotect write is involved.
My latest guess is that whereas my "ulimit -s" shows 8192, yours
will show something much higher, but not "unlimited".   And that
high stack rlimit is pushing the roof of your userspace down, to
the point where the -Xmx868m mapping barely fits.
But though fiddling with my "ulimit -s" does change the layout,
I've not yet been able to reproduce your failure.  And this has
nothing whatever to do with the shm/mprotect issue or patch.

Well, I guess I'd like to see what "ulimit -a" and "ulimit -H -a"
show on your machine (it's really "ulimit -s" I'm interested in,
but we might as well see the whole lot).  And the output from
"cat /proc/$(pidof java)/maps" while you've got Tomcat running
successfully.  And what is your distro?
But it seems unlikely that any of this information will help me to
make that strange leap from my patches to your experience of them.
