If you want to have a large cookies, you could have glibc allocate a 
memory block to store it, and have glibc responsible for keeping track 
of it.  As far as I know, off_t can hold a pointer on all our 
implementations (only 32-bit machines have 32-bit off_t as an option; 
Alpha *might* be an exception but I don't think so.)

Readdir/telldir are much, much, more fundamental than that.  We're 
talking interfaces which have been standardized for longer than Linux 
itself has existed.
