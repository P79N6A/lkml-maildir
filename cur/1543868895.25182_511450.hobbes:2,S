  Sorry if I missed it in quick review, as I told, there's a bit much

  Why? It's the same, except that it already exists, generic one (not
limited to pxafb), and requires 1 function (too bad that C doesn't
support lambda's):
==============
static void h4000_set_bl_intensity(int intensity)
{
        /* LCD brightness is driven by PWM0.
         * We'll set the pre-scaler to 8, and the period to 1024, this
         * means the backlight refresh rate will be 3686400/(8*1024) =
         * 450 Hz which is quite enough.
         */
        PWM_CTRL0 = 7;            /* pre-scaler */
        PWM_PWDUTY0 = intensity; /* duty cycle */
        PWM_PERVAL0 = H4000_MAX_INTENSITY;      /* period */
        if (intensity > 0) {
                pxa_set_cken(CKEN0_PWM0, 1);
                asic3_set_gpio_out_b(&h4000_asic3.dev,
                        GPIOB_BACKLIGHT_POWER_ON, GPIOB_BACKLIGHT_POWER_ON);
        } else {
                pxa_set_cken(CKEN0_PWM0, 0);
                asic3_set_gpio_out_b(&h4000_asic3.dev,
                        GPIOB_BACKLIGHT_POWER_ON, 0);
        }
}
static struct corgibl_machinfo h4000_bl_machinfo = {
        .default_intensity = H4000_MAX_INTENSITY / 4,
        .limit_mask = 0x0fff,
        .max_intensity = H4000_MAX_INTENSITY,
        .set_bl_intensity = h4000_set_bl_intensity,
};
struct platform_device h4000_bl = {
        .name = "corgi-bl",
        .dev = {
                .platform_data = &h4000_bl_machinfo,
        },
};

  I sent a bit of criticism for that too ;-). YMMV, but kernel
solutions are just bound to be pretty simple and generic and lack
any "niceties", which you'd likely want to do anyway eventually. For
example, what if you'll want to implement "fade out" effect for
keyboard backlight? Doing it in adhoc manner in kernel? Whereas with
the LCD classdev, you can write generic "fade out" trigger and
attach/detach it from userspace.
