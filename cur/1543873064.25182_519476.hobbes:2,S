Let's be practical here, what you're asking is basically impossible.
Unless by deterministic you mean that it never enters the a non
trivial syscall, in which case, you just want to know about maximum
RSS of the process, which we already account).

You seem to want total isolation. You could use virtualization?

It is basically handwaving anyway. The only approach I've seen with
a sane (not perfect, but good) way of accounting memory use is this
one. If you care to define "proper", then we could discuss that.
