Hi, all,
I'm running 2.4.0-test6 and, after awhile, the system seems to thrash
quite badly only running X, Window Maker, Netscape, a gnome-terminal, and
gnomeICU. Needless to say, things grind to a halt quickly.
I'm running on a PPro 200MHz with 48M RAM. Attached is the .config file.
Any suggestions?
