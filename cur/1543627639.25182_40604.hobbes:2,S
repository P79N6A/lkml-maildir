Doing it with a loopback like interface at a higher level is the much 
saner operation - I understand why Martin removed the byteswap support, 
and agree with it 100%. It just didn't make any sense from a driver 
standpoint.
In fact, the byteswapping was actively incorrect, in that it swapped data 
in-place - which means that it corrupts the data area while IO is in 
progress. It also only works for PIO.
The only reason byteswapping exists is a rather historical one: Linux did 
the wrong thing for "insw/outsw" on big-endian architectures at one point 
(it byteswapped the data).
(Oh, and coupled with the fact that the IDE ID string is in a "big-endian"  
word order, which may have been one more reason to add a "do byteswapped 
IO" thing).
