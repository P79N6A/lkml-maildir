A virtual machine would be an administratively easy way of doing this.
Let the 'app' be a VM with the real apps installed inside.  The users would
effectively be confined to a *file* on the host, not merely their home
directories.
My (biased :-) recommendation would be User-mode Linux 
(
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
), but VMWare would work as
well.
