Then fix tar. If feel that you can do [v]fat with constant inodes across mounts
and eliminate all races then contact Viro (viro@math.psu.edu). He was unable to
do so. There are just not enough information about file on vfat to give it
constant inode number (remember: inode should NOT be changed when opened file
is truncated to zero and then filled again so you can not use cluster number
for such inode). If you not feel that you can do that then try to fix tar.
