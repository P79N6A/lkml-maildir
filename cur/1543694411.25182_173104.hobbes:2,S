Subject: [BUG][PATCH] fs/binfmt_elf.c:load_elf_binary() doesn't verify interpreter arch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In fs/binfmt_elf.c:load_elf_binary() (both 2.6 and 2.4), there is some minimal
checking whether the interpreter it's about to load/run is a valid ELF file,
but it fails to check whether the interpreter is of the correct arch.
We ran into this when a borked powerpc64-linux toolchain set the interpreter
on our 64-bit app to our 32-bit ld.so.  Executing the app caused the kernel to
really chew up memory.  I'm assuming x86_64 and sparc64 might possibly see
the same behavior.
A patch against 2.6 is attached below for review (although it applies with some
fuzz on 2.4).  Note I'm not sure of the history behind INTERPRETER_AOUT, so I
added the test for INTERPRETER_ELF so as not to change it's behavior in case
someone still relies on it.
As an aside, it seems the elf_check_arch() macros should really be checking
for more than a valid e_machine value.  I'd think checking one or more of the
e_ident[EI_CLASS], e_ident[EI_DATA] and e_ident[EI_OSABI] values would be
required as well, no?
