Subject: patch needed in traps.c for linux-abi
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Sirs, 
Trying to keep the linux-abi (a patch to the linux kernel 
that allows a linux system to run foreign binaries see 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-abi
) run with current kernels,
a change must be done to arch/i386/kernel/traps.c.
the patch commit 522e93e3fcdbf00ba85c72fde6df28cfc0486a65 modified
descriptor and trap table. 
Could somebody suggest how to change the following code:
static void __init set_call_gate(void *a, void *addr)
{
        _set_gate(a,12,3,addr,__KERNEL_CS);
}
needed in the linux-abi patched traps.c to conform to the new ceanups?
It should probably look like:
static void __init set_call_gate(void *a, void *addr)
{
        _set_gate(a, 0xnn | DESCTYPE_DPL3, addr, __KERNEL_CS);
}
with some value for 0xnn, formerly 12.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Regards
Mauro Tassinari
