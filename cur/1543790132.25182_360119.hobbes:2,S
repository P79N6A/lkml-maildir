ACPI was made dependent upon CONFIG_PM in 2.6.13, where it was not before.
So a "make oldconfig" in 2.6.13 against a 2.6.10 .config which had ACPI
enabled will end up disabling ACPI.
Interestingly, SMT used to work without ACPI, but now does not seem to
work without it.
Not sure if either of the above have been addressed in 2.6.14...haven't
had a chance to test
