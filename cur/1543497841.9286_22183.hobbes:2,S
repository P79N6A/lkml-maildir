   Per that article, it tells just that the AFS (Andrew FS) is
   officially being supported by IBM at Linux systems.
   The way that thing is written does not tell any *new* feature for
   AFS being introduced, e.g. no Linux based AFS storage *server*.
   Already before, TransArc (now owned by IBM!)  has provided certain
   level of AFS filesystem *client* support for binary-only modules.
   To my knowledge (including all gossip I heard at Linux Expo), they
   are *not* doing same as SGI did with their XFS.  No SOURCE release!
