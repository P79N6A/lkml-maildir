Ely,
This is almost certainly NOT a Linux problem.
All Netscape versions 4.0x and 4.5 are infamous for randomly becoming
zombies upon exit under Windows NT 4.0, their undead corpses continuing to
consume up to 90% of CPU cycles until killed with Task Manager.  The
chances of this happening in any one session are low (<<1%), but with a
dozen or more NT machines with Netscape it's a mathematical certainty I'll
see at least one occurance per week.
This also happens under Solaris 2.5.1.  Just two weeks ago I was called in
on a Saturday to kill a zombie Netscape 4.5 process that had brought an
Ultra 10 workstation to its virtual knees.  In a month I'll have two dozen
of these workstations running Netscape 4.5 on a three shift 24/7 basis.
I'm not looking forward to getting calls in the middle of the night.
I *AM* looking forward to the GPL (I hope) release of Mozilla 5.0 so we can
finally find and fix whatever is causing this problem.
