I believe situation is 'vfs maintainers seriously dislike AA', but if
they were given good enough reasons -- like 'selinux is broken crap
that does not really work', we probably could twist their arms or
something.
So question is not 'is AA better then SELinux' but 'is AA so much
better than SELinux that we want to overrule vfs maintainers'.
