sh-3.00# mount -t tmpfs /tmp /tmp
sh-3.00# cd /tmp
sh-3.00# mkdir woot
sh-3.00# mount --bind woot /var
sh-3.00# cd /var
sh-3.00# mkdir sub
sh-3.00# mount --move /tmp sub
sh-3.00# ls -lR

ls: not listing already-listed directory: ./sub/woot

./sub
find: Filesystem loop detected; `./sub/woot' has the same device number and 
inode as a directory which is 2 levels higher in the filesystem hierarchy.
./sub/woot
