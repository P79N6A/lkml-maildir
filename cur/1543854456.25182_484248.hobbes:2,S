I found the problem patch, but not the root cause.
The xconfig segfault begins in 2.6.19-rc5-git3 (-git2 is OK).
A relatively simple Kconfig change causes it (but why?).
(Note:  The running kernel doesn't matter, just which kernel tree
is being viewed/config-ed.)
If I back out the patches below, -git3 (xconfig ^F find/search)
works for me.
