But your are completely missing the point! What chip is in your cell phone?
Most likely an ARM or Mips. 32bits.  What chip is used in Fords electronic
motor control? PPC4xx. 32bits. What chip is used in the german d-box (DVB
settop box)? M68323 with the next generation going for PPC4xx. Still 32bits.
Now look at the Cobalt Qube and Raq systems, those are the systems you will
see more and more, not the allround-PC.  It's the appliance market which is
the future, not the good old computer market.  And there power consumption
and price count, not peak-performance.

And for most purposes these servers will be powerful enough and as
long as the customers are content with those system's performance, there
will be people offering support for them. Why is Intel still investing in
the StrongARM platform (which will deliver 600 MIPS on 1 Watt of power
consumption in the next generation if what i have read is true)? Because
nobody with a working brain would put an Itanium in a cell phone or motor
control or palm pad or IP phone or ...  You name it and it will use 32bit
embedded controllers in 99% of the time (unless an 8 or 16bit controller
is enough which still are around and dead cheap!)

That is not true. Most of the people i know are content using 5 year old
hardware and 5 year old software as long as that combo gets the job done.
And most of the time it does.
