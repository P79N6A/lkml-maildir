Hello,
I have a Toshiba Satellite A135-S4427 with and Intel 3945ABG card, the
driver is not working properly.
When I turn on my PC it works fine, but If I ever bring the interface
down, I no longer can associate it with any AP without rebooting, even
the one I was using, I tried rmmod/modprobe iwl3945, didn't do
anything,
iwconfig shows that the wlan0 has the radio turned off, and
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/drivers/iwl3945/0000:04:00.0/rf_kill
1
Even If I echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/iwl3945/0000:04:00.0/rf_kill
whenever I try to associate the interface with an AP it turns back to
1, I tried both iwconfig and NetworkManager, same problem.
There's a button on my laptop for Radio SoftKill (fn+F8) but it's not
working, the soft kill is being enabled/disabled without my
interference.
I tried it on kernel-2.6.24 and kernel-2.6.25-rc2 same result...
Any help is appreciated...
