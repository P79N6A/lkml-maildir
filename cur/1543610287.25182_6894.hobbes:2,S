Your code is violating one of the assertions in
kmem_cache_create(), check the BUG(); calls in
mm/slab.c:kmem_cache_create() to try and figure out
which one you are firing off.
Probably either you are trying to send it debug flags
but CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG is not defined _OR_ you are trying
to create the same SLAB cache twice (forgetting to destroy
it on module unload perhaps)?
Slab if fine, it's your code which is busted :)
