it would be purerly a theorical benchmark, to see if the current state
of the art technology is hurted more or less by 4:4. If it's hurted less
it's reasonable to assume newer cpus will be hurted less too. However
we'll probably deal with only with a few more generation of 32bit cpus
and it will be only from intel so I agree with you the xeon test is the
most interesting for this.
