I don't disagree on that, but it seems that KDE developers have put some 
serious effort into making the software well-behaved, and unless there 
is some measurable benefit from the code which negates the benefits of 
that effort, it seems desirable to appreciate code code by letting it work.
I was more commenting on the good performance at the bottom end than 
addressing the large machines. All the big machines I have are in the 
overkill range, and finding small benefits doesn't do much with 
production loads, so I can't contribute any useful info at that end.
