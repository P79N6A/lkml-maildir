You call windows an OS ?? I call it a bunch of function calls with way to
many arguments written by a bunch of ***** that like to nag people instead
of making an OS stable.

Agree, OO could make life easier.
Some arguments why not to use it in the kernel :
- C++ gives overhead. With something like a kernel that's unwanted. 
- Things like exception handling is hard to do in a kernel. 
- The're a lot more people that know C than C++
And I probably forgot a few :)
