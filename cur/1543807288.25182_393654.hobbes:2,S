Huh?  I'm only adding more goop (beyond a single inline bit test
of current->flags) in the:
	NUMA and (MEMPOLICY or MEM_SPREAD)
path.

There are three copies of ____cache_alloc() in mm/slab.c, once
compiled.  Do you really want three copies of alternate_node_alloc()
routine in the kernel, just to avoid a subroutine call in the "NUMA and
(MEMPOLICY or MEM_SPREAD)" case?
I doubt you want that.
In other words, I don't understand yet.
