At least you can see how kapmd mechanism actually works.

Those counters are running. Try this one:
/*
 * This is simple program which should show weak spots in linux's scheduler
 */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <sys/timeb.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int startgame;
int
ticks( void )
{
struct timeb tb;
int sec, msec;
ftime( &tb );
sec = tb.time - startgame;
msec = tb.millitm;
return sec * 1000 + msec;
}
void
main( int argc, char *argv[] )
{
int delta, badboy = 0, count = 1000000;
int t1, t2;
startgame = time(NULL);
if (argc>1) { 
  badboy = 1; 
  printf( "I'm a *BAD* boy! " );
  usleep( 100000 );
  t1 = ticks();
  usleep( 100000 );
  t2 = ticks();
  delta = t2-t1;
  printf( "And bad boys know that jiffie is %dmsec\n", delta );
  delta = 10;
  }
else { printf( "I'm a good boy.\n" ); delta = 20; }
while(1) {
  if ((ticks()-t1) % delta > ((delta * 17)/20))
    if (badboy)
      usleep(10000);
  if (!((--count)%100000)) { printf( "." ); fflush( stdout ); }
  if (!count) break;
  }
}
it used to work. Bad boy used to be charged 0% cpu even if it ate 70%
