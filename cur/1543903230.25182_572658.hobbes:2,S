Sorry for being not clear. What i was asking is thus:
A device that has legacy interrupts and MSI-X. I was thinking that if
MSI-X failed one should fall back to MSI mode (single message), that's
what i was assuming.
In such a case, i do enable MSI-X mode on the device, when the request
for 2 ^ n  number of messages (where messages can be a max of 32), If
the request fails one falls into a single message mode, ie MSI ?

The device that i have in mind is a SAA7160.
