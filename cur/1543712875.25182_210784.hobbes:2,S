Subject: NFS ENOLCK problem with CONFIG_SECURITY=n

I'm having problems with lockf returning ENOLCK on an NFS directory.
I also see messages like
    nsm_mon_unmon: rpc failed, status=-13
    lockd: cannot monitor 10.0.0.5
    lockd: failed to monitor 10.0.0.5
The system is an IA64 system running Debian testing with kernel 2.6.4.
I found previous reports of a similar problem, but the solution was to
set CONFIG_SECURITY to n (or add CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES).
However, I already have CONFIG_SECURITY off:
    $ zgrep CONFIG_SECURITY /proc/config.gz
    # CONFIG_SECURITY is not set
Am I missing something?
Thanks,
  Roland
