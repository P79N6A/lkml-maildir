There's two sides to that, the ability to use higher order pages in the
kernel also means that it's possible to use larger TLB entries while
keeping the base page size small, too. There are already many places in
the kernel that attempt to use the largest possible size when setting up
the entries, and this is something that those of us with tiny
software-managed TLBs are a huge fan of -- some platforms have even opted
to do perverse things such as scanning for contiguous PTEs and bumping to
the next order automatically at set_pte() time.
Unplug is also interesting from a power management point of view.
Powering off is still more attractive than self-refresh, for example, but
could also be used at run-time depending on the workload.
