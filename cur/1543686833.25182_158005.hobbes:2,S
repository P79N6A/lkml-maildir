	static long no_idt[2];

	__asm__ __volatile__("lidt %0": :"m" (no_idt));
Notice that no_idt is an array.  Therefore its identifier decays
into a pointer.  Therefore, what this statement is really asking
for is
	{
	  long *tmp = no_idt;
	  asm volatile ("lidt %0" : : "m" (*&tmp));
	}
which is clearly not what was intended.
Fixed by doing
	__asm__ __volatile__("lidt %0": :"m" (*no_idt));
