I have a XP1800+ in a Shuttle AK31 rev 3.1 board (KT266A chipset) with 4 
Kingston non-ecc non-registered 512MB PC2100 (Infineon chips) modules 
running, working with all 2GB correctly with no errors on a 100+ hours 
run of memtest86 v2.7 (www.memtest86.com). The disadvantage is that it 
needs the BIOS RAM settings at almost the slowest (2T command rate) to pass.
Also, I have another of the same configuration, but with 4 ECC Kingston 
512MB PC2100, and that system passed a 10hour memtest86 2.7 run (did not 
try longer), albeit also only with the slow RAM settings.
Both systems are happily running Linux 2.4.9 and 2.4.14
Cya,
Jelle.
