I have a similar problem with maybe the same type of disk. My analysis 
of the problem is still not that complete so I did not asked on the 
kernel mailing list yet.
The disk type we use here in a ten disk RAID6 is:
Maxtor 7V300F0 300GB Sata2
on Promise Sata 300 TX4 controllers
Once in a week or two a random disk is not responding anymore and needs 
a complete power off/on cycle to recover. After power cycle the disk 
works without problems, doesn't report any SMART problems ...
I'm quite sure it is no problem with power supply, motherboard, 
backplane or controllers. Still open are cabling and disks. Nearly the 
same setup of hardware - just with different disks - is running smooth 
since about 8 month in a different system.
If this is the same disk type we maybe should return the disks to our 
hardware vendors as it may be a disk problem.
The only messages I get are like that:
