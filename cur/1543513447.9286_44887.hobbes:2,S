Your effort is greatly appreciated, I may be one of your more frequent visitors
to cesdis, I compile a kernel on average every day.  I strongly prefer your
drivers to those in the kernel for the simple fact that they are normally more
robust and simply work.  This is a line of history I have developed since 1.x
kernels, not politically polite, not "because someone said..", because history
has given a track record.
Thankyou,
