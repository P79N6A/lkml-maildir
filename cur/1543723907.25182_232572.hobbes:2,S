Are you sure?  I've seen K&R C compilers for 32-bit platforms in which
0xdeadbeef had type *signed* int, as opposed to unsigned int.  I
thought the preference for an unsigned type in this case was
introduced in ISO C90, but it might as well have been a bug in that
compiler.  Although I'm told other compilers display similar behavior.
