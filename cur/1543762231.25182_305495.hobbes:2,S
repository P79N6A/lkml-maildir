All 9 patches applied, thanks Herbert.
Patches 7 through 9 were generated differently from the others,
look at the directory prefixes (or rather, a lack thereof):
===== cipher.c 1.26 vs edited =====
--- 1.26/crypto/cipher.c	2005-03-22 21:56:21 +11:00
+++ edited/cipher.c	2005-03-22 21:59:53 +11:00
I had to hand edit these before sending them through my patch
