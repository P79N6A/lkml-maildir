Subject: [PATCH] Do not rebuild full kernel tree again and again...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
  I've returned back to the computer after month and half, and I've found that
I cannot reasonably build kernel - just repeating 'make' twice without doing any
change forced full rebuild of everything, which as far as I can tell is not 
intended behavior.  As I did not notice this being reported on the LKML, and
2.6.16-rc6 still suffers from this problem, here comes report + patch.
  Problem seems to be that new make includes FORCE prerequisite in $? - apparently
new make treats $? not as 'prerequisities newer than target', but as 
'prerequisities newer than target or missing'.  Due to this $(if) in make rules 
always succeeded as it always received at least 'FORCE', and 'FORCE'
is not an empty string.  So let's filter out 'FORCE' from $? - unless somebody
can confirm that make 3.81 is broken and unusable for kernel...
							Thanks,
								Petr Vandrovec
