did you have a chance to try the yum kernel by any chance? The -testing 
one you can try on Fedora with little hassle, by doing this as root:
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/rt-testing.repo
[rt-testing]
name=Ingo's Real-Time (-rt) test-kernel for FC6
baseurl=
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/realtime-preempt/yum-testing/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
<Ctrl-D>
and "yum install kernel-rt" and a reboot should get you going.

i did spend quite some time to debug your tv-tuner problem back then, 
and for that purpose alone i bought a tv tuner card to test this myself. 
(but it worked on my testbox)
