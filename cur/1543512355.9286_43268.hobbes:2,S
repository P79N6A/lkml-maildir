Try to read `/etc/init.d/{drv,dev}*' one of these days on Solaris.

Maybe it's because you don't read what you reply to ?
The claim was that OSS would break if you used modules along with a script
that clears the /dev hierarchy based on what is really available (hint:
before the OSS module is loaded, those things are not available so the
devices would be removed, preventing the autoloading from kicking in).

Oh yes!  But persistence of the special-device-file is not necessarily
such a good idea when the underlying major/minor assignmment is dynamic.
