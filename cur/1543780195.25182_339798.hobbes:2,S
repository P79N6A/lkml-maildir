Why not the other way around?
Just define IRQ_PER_CPU to 0 on architectures not needing it and
add a FAT comment there, that this disables it. Or make it a config option.
Then just leave the code as is and let GCC optimize the dead code
away without any changes in the C file. It works, I just checked it ;-)
