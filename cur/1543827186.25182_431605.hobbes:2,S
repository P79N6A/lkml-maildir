Right, and that proves my point.  When you start making major changes 
like 32->64 bit block numbers, you should communicate to the user (with 
a big blinky "ext4" sign) that his filesystem metadata will change a 
lot, not a little.  Not to mention that such code will add yet more "if 
(new) .. else .." code.
