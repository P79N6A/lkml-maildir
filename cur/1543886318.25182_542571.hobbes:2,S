Hi, Steven.
Nice to meet you again.
I have read the rt-mutex-design.txt that you wrote. That is excellent
description of rt_mutex. But I have a question for rt_mutex.
As you said:

After read the implementation of rt_mutex_adjust_prio_chain(), I found
the we really require maximin lock depth (1024 default), but I can not
see the check for more same locks duplication. Does this doc is
inconsistent with code?
Thanks in advanced.
Good luck.
