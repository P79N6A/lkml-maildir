ROTFL
This is NOT morse over blinking lights. Even at 12 WPM,
which is moderately fast, you'd have to stare at the
lights for over an hour without blinking! Keep in mind
that people know morse by sound, not sight, so you'd
have to slow it down. Maybe 24 hours for an oops?
(note: in morse, hex digits are slow)
No, the lights just blink. Encoding just the instruction
pointer, in binary, might be worthwhile. I have doubts.
As for the audio... you can copy morse for over an hour
or you can tape record 4 minutes of noise. Hard choice?
