Hi Mike,
Thanks for the files.  That is really odd.  And you are sure this just  
works with 2.6.22.10 on the exact same file?  Have you run  "chkdsk / 
f /v /x" on the NTFS volume from Windows?
Would you be able to apply the attached patch to your 2.6.23.1 kernel  
and try again and then send me the NTFS error messages?  The patch  
should cause more verbose error reporting to happen...  Thanks!
Best regards,
	Anton
