A detail:
I receive error message (no such device) when I try load toshiba_acpi on 
my Toshiba M45-S355 (BIOS is Toshiba and NOT Phoenix).
So, I can't change brightness of LCD.
To solve it, I use omnibook driver available in:
<
http://omnibook.sourceforge.net
>
Last SVN can get with:
svn export 
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/omnibook/omnibook/trunk
With omnibook driver I can change brightness writing in /proc/omnibook/lcd
Only one problem: multimedia keys don't is recognized by xev and I can't 
configure it with omnibook driver.
Best regards,
Renato S. Yamane
