Lee, you mentioned 2.2.x kernels did not exhibit this problem.
Was this on the same hardware you are currently testing?
Which 2.2.x version were you using?
Was the 2.2.x serial driver also identifying the UART as a 16550A?
Can you get /proc/interrupts output
from both the current setup and the 2.2.x setup?
It would be interesting to compare the interrupt
assignment and UART setup between the versions.
