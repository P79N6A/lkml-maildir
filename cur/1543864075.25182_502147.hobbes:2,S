We do use such loops in many places. However, stuff like array 
initialization and special casing cannot use a loop. I am not sure what we 
could change there. The hard coding is necessary because each zone 
currently has these invariant characteristics that we need to consider. 
Reducing the number of zones reduces the amount of special casing in the 
VM that needs to be considered at run time and that is a potential issue
for trouble.

I just hope we can handle the VM complexity of load balancing etc etc that 
this will introduce. Also each zone has management overhead and will cause 
the touching of additional cachelines on many VM operations. Much of that 
management overhead becomes unnecessary if we reduce zones.

The main benefit is a significant simplification of the VM, leading to 
robust and reliable operations and a reduction of the maintenance 
headaches coming with the additional zones.
If we would introduce the ability of allocating from a range of 
physical addresses then the need for DMA zones would go away allowing 
flexibility for device driver DMA allocations and at the same time we get 
rid of special casing in the VM.
