You really don't want to go down that path.  Doubling the storage size
will double the work necessary to move old objects - hard to imagine a
design that scales worse.
CPU schedulers, btw, take this approach.  But they cheat, as they know
the maximum lifetime of their objects (in-flight instructions, rename
registers,...) is bounded to n.  Old objects are refreshed for free.
