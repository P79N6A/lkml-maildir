No, it's not: replacing does not create derivative work. Modification does.
You've chosen to attach a physical dimension to "program copy" and I'm 
arguing that even under this distorted line of reasoning you can't 
support your position:

* Tivo takes public sources, modifies them and builds a brand new blob
* Tivo installs this new copy on the device, most likely side-by-side 
with the old one - notice how the new copy is derived from public 
sources and has absolutely nothing to do with the old version (heck, it 
can be a totally different kernel for what it's worth)
* Tivo deletes the old copy from the device
It seems pretty obvious that the only right Tivo is withholding is the 
right to install new versions on the device - they never do (and really 
never could) "modify" the physical copy on your device (which is your 
main argument).

Don't skip the part where the in-memory version started as an exact copy 
of the original being replaced. Notice the difference? ;)
