Subject: [PATCH] NFSD: fix wrong mnt_writer count in rename (MMOTM 2007-11-10-19-05)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

NFSD forgets to call mnt_drop_write after a successful rename.  Here's a
fix.  (Ah, the curse of a stackable file system developer: you have to debug
everyone else's too. :-)
One thing I wasn't sure is whether I could move the mnt_drop_write line a
little above, just after the call to vfs_rename.  If we can drop the ref
earlier, it could improve scalability/performance just a bit, no? (i.e.,
what are the ramifications of holding on to this mnt writer ref longer than
needed?)
Cheers,
Erez.
