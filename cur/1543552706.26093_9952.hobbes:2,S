I'm using 2.4.0-test10-pre5 on a PIII (compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3) and
having problems with usb. I'm able to load the usb-driver (usb-uhci) and
then the driver for my usb-webcam (cpia_usb). The webcam works fine for
something like 20 minutes. After that I start to get this kind of messages
to the syslog:
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
Sometimes it's "2-order allocation failed.". After these messages the
camera doesn't work anymore (until I unplug it and replug it
again.. sometimes it also needs the driver [cpia_usb] to be reloaded).
I've attached output of dmesg when booting the machine.
This is what I get when loading the usb-uhci:

I'm using Debian GNU/Linux woody. Yeah, I have modutils 2.3.19.
Thanks for your help.
