Is the problem really, fundamentally a lack of readahead in the
kernel? Or is it that your application is huge bloated pig? 
With admittedly no evidence whatsoever, I suspect the latter is 
really the root cause of this type of problem. 
Ditto for the "takes me years to switch between desktops" ... 
maybe it's just that RAM is full of utter garbage due to mindless 
feature-bloat, so everything gets swapped out. If you're running
something like Netscape / Mozilla ... ;-)
I still think userspace is 90% of the problem here ...
