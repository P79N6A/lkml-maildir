i had the same problems with 2.2.15 i needed the
following presuspend script:
#!/bin/sh
# need to unload sound modules before suspend
# kill any sound makers
killall -9 xmms
killall -9 mpg123
killall -9 mixer_applet
#/usr/bin/esdplay /etc/sysconfig/sounds/presuspend.wav
# kill mouse to quiet sound, seriously
killall -9 gpm
# save soundlevels
/usr/bin/aumix -f /etc/.aumixrc -S
/sbin/ifdown eth0       # free card
/sbin/cardctl eject
/sbin/rmmod opl3
/sbin/rmmod opl3sa2 
/sbin/rmmod mpu401
/sbin/rmmod ad1848
/sbin/rmmod sound
/sbin/rmmod soundcore
/sbin/rmmod soundlow
/sbin/rmmod -as
the gpm killing is really necessary without this the
sound module will not unload!!!
then my postsuspend script is:
#!/bin/sh
# what we do after we get back from suspend
/sbin/cardctl insert
/sbin/rmmod opl3 2>/dev/null
/sbin/rmmod opl3sa2  2>/dev/null
/sbin/rmmod mpu401 2>/dev/null
/sbin/rmmod ad1848 2>/dev/null
/sbin/rmmod sound 2>/dev/null
/sbin/rmmod soundcore 2>/dev/null
/sbin/rmmod soundlow 2>/dev/null
# ok now put sound back
modprobe sound
/usr/bin/aumix -f /etc/.aumixrc -L > /dev/null
#/usr/bin/esdplay
/etc/sysconfig/sounds/postsuspend.wav
# restart at daemon it might have lost time
/etc/rc.d/init.d/atd restart
# put 2 button mouse back
/usr/sbin/gpm -t ps/2
good luck...
