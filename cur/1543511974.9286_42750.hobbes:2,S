In Unix, permissions on files are part of the files, not in some
configuration file. /etc/fstab is a configuration file for mount(8), the
information there can't be sensibly mapped on Unix owner/permissions. BTW,
the entries there allow you to mount _iff_ you have permissions on the
devices themselves. The permission bits are the systems' last (only?) line
of defense against miscreants; permissions of devices are extremely
critical, much more so than even the most critical normal files. Fooling
around with this if there is no *extremely* good reason is out. Needless to
say, I've seen only rather weak reasons for some scheme like devfs.

Name one use of configuration files for local permissions/ownership on
Unix/Linux.
