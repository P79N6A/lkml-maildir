Subject: [GIT PULL] FireWire updates post 2.6.23
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus, please pull from the for-linus branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git for-linus
to receive the following IEEE 1394/ FireWire subsystem updates.  It's
almost all just bugfixes, and had I anticipated that 2.6.23 was going to
grow an -rc9 I would have sent most of the material for the new firewire
stack already during the rc phase.
Most patches went into -mm during mid July...mid September; some simple
patches are from the past two weeks.  Combined diff follows in a reply.
