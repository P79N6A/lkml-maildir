Umm, we ship something that isn't GPL-compatible.  Whenever I found
something like that (GFDL documentation, headers from vendor SDKs,
strange license text) we got that solved easily.  Now because it's the
magic firmware crap we shouldn't care anymore.
And no, I'm not going to convert it.  I'm not a usb person and I couldn't
test it.  If one of you usb guys want to convert it that's fine, if we
get the files relicensed under a GPL-compatible license that's fine aswell,
else I'll send a removal patch to Linus.
Stop beeing sloppy about copyrights.
