Looks bogus. Please, instead of random band-aids, try to analyse the
problem a bit deeper, that would help. SW TLB load works on 603 now,
so there must be something wrong in the low level 8xx related code.
do_no_page should have inserted/fixed a PTE, so the cache flush in
update_mmu_cache should work. If not, then something went wrong,
but then, please at least have a look at what PTE was inserted and
why it would be faulting that way, stop randomly playing with
update_mmu_cache.
Ben.
