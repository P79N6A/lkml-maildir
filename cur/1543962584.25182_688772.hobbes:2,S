Based on Mike's mails I have quickly tried reverting the following two 
commits to see if that would fix the GROUP_SCHED related regression, but I 
still get a merge error with the second one in sched_fair.c:
$ git revert 7ba2e74ab5
$ git revert 8f1bc385cf
I don't feel comfortable solving the conflict myself as I'd have absolutely 
no idea what I'd be doing and it all seems to require a lot of precision.
As other suggested patches don't seem ready for testing yet, I'll just wait 
for further instructions :-)
Cheers,
FJP
