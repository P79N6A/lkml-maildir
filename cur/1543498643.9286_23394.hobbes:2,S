While we're being pedantic, notice that the last form won't work if
/usr/src/linux happens to be a symlink. So
cd /usr/src/linux && find . -type f -a \! -name \*.o -a \! -name \*.a \
	-a \! -name vmlin\* | xargs grep -i fuck
would be slightly better. Also, note that there is no reason why Makefile's
and Config.in's etc etc can't contain `fuck'.
