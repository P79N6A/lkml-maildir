As a developer of integrated systems, it is imperative the we be able to
re-program EEPROMs and MAC addresses.  Cobalt systems all have Cobalt as
the MFR section of the MAC address.  Sun Systems all have Sun.  (insert pokes
about whether Cobalt is Sun here...)

Other things get stored in the EEPROM - for example, Wake-on-Lan options.
Just to name one.
