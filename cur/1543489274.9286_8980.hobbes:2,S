	I've been running 2-ac7 on my Alpha system since it came
out, and have not experienced any troubles.  As of 2.2.3-pre3, 
Linus added the necessary patch to fix problems with the Alpha
port introduced in 2.2.2 - have not tried it yet.  
	If past experience is any indicator, the 'good stuff'
from -ac7 is in 2.2.3 and the 'fun stuff' will be kept for
Alan's first 2.2.3 ac patchset.  
But don't take my word for it :-)
Best regards,
Daniel
