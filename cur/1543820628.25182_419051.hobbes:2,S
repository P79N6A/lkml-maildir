VIA's numerous pci quirks are not related to this patch. They only hit
one problem with it having only 4 bits encoding their interrupt.

There are probably better ways to control 224 possible IRQs by their
total number instead of their range, and per-cpu IDTs are the better
answer to the IRQ shortage altogether. But just going back to the way it
was wouldn't be right I think. We were able to run 2 generations of
systems only because we had this compression, other big systems
benefited from it as well.
Thanks,
