It was due to additional inl()'s and outl()'s in the driver fastpath.
Testcase was netperf Tx and Rx.  Just TCP over 100bT. AFAIK, this overhead
is intrinsic to NAPI.  Not to say that its costs outweigh its benefits,
but it's just there.
If someone wants to point me at all the bits and pieces to get a
NAPIfied 3c59x working on 2.5.current I'll retest, and generate
some instruction-level oprofiles.
