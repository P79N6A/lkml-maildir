Subject: [PATCH] LTTng 0.6.36 for 2.6.18 (now with markers)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I have, since a few weeks, moved LTTng to the markers infrastructure. I
left the ltt-dev users and contributors test the markers and LTTng on various
architectures (i386, x86_64, PowerPC, -ppc, ARM, MIPS) before posting it on
LKML.
The most important new features since the my post :
- Use DebugFS
- Use the "Markers" infrastructure (updated since the last post on LKML).
- Dynamically loadable "probes" that connects to the markers.
- CPU Hotplug support (this piece seemed necessary for the Xen port I am
  currently working on)
- Use of per-CPU atomic operations even on SMP machines (no lock prefix, no
  memory barriers) to update the per-cpu counters. An explicit smp_wmb()
  is used at the one place where the subbuffers are tagged "full" and
  smp_rmb() is used in the buffer consumer just after it reads this counter
  indicating that the subbuffer is full.
I am not submitting the probes themselves, as they can be provided as separate
kernel modules.
Comments and constructive criticism are, as always, welcome.
The patches follow.
Mathieu
