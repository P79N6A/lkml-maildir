In ext4, we already mark each extent having preallocated blocks as
uninitialized. This is done as part of following code (which is part of
patch 5/7) in ext4_ext_get_blocks() :  
@@ -2122,6 +2160,8 @@ int ext4_ext_get_blocks(handle_t *handle
        /* try to insert new extent into found leaf and return */
        ext4_ext_store_pblock(&newex, newblock);
        newex.ee_len = cpu_to_le16(allocated);
+       if (create == EXT4_CREATE_UNINITIALIZED_EXT)  /* Mark uninitialized */
+               ext4_ext_mark_uninitialized(&newex);
        err = ext4_ext_insert_extent(handle, inode, path, &newex);
        if (err) {

Ok. Will update the comment.
Thanks!
