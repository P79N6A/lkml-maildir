    There's precedent for it;  other operating systems have implemented
    driver overlays (and did it quite some time ago).   It would be VERY
    useful for install floppies, too -- build a block driver that talks
    directly to bios interrupts, use that to mount the install media,
    then overlay the native drivers over it when you can access media
    that's larger than 1.44mb (and with that, you can also discard the
    initrd kludge and use a different bios driver to load the installer
    off the floppy analogue de jour)
