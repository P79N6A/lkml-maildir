Why do you think it's serial? 5-1 looks more like /dev/console.
This also seems to happen only in initramfs for people who see this.
People say that compiling-in some modules (unfortunately they don't
remember which) makes it work again.
Can this be some init order problem, that the /dev/console is not
initialized but, we fork a process which tries to access it?
