It's hard to tell what you want here, as is often the case with these 
issues and facilities, so lets just drop right down to the metal.
The VGA video RAMDAC palette is at 0x3c8 in write mode and 0x03c7 in 
read mode.  To write a palette color, you write it's color index to 0x3c8, 
and then sequentially write 3 bytes to 0x3c9, one byte each for red, green 
and blue, in that order. When the index is loaded into 0x3c8, successive 
writes to 0x3c9 are rotated into the appropriate R G and B internally. The 
6 LEAST significant bits of each data byte are what goes to the DAC for that 
color index. 
At least, that's what I get from the docs I'm looking at. I've been looking 
at CRT controller stuff recently, but not palette stuff.
You can stick something that does this in init/main.c I think. There's a 
VGA palette manipulator in ../contrib in the SVGATextMode package, if I recall 
where I got it, and you can bang on this stuff from userland via something 
that can lseek /dev/port. I use Mr. Paysan's GForth, although pforth beckons.
