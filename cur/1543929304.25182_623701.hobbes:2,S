Yes, the heartbeat trigger driver assumes brightness_set() routine can
be called from timer.  Other led-triggers also have this assumption.
So I'd suggest using workqueue for your led driver, as like as the
leds-gpio driver.  Or you can just use the leds-gpio driver and
implement the gpio interface (gpio_set_value_cansleep) instead of the
led interface.
