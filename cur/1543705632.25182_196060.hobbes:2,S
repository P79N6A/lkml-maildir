I'm seeing frequent issues with my usb mouse under the 2.6.2 kernel, in
which the pointer will suddenly freeze.  It remains stuck until I tap a
key on the keyboard, at which point it continues working normally (for
a little while).  Also, the keyboard occasionally acts like a key is
stuck down, which ends promptly when I move the mouse.
The mouse is an ordinary Logitech wheel-mouse and the keyboard is a
Microsoft Natural, both of which are connected via an Avocent
SwitchView USB KVM switch.  The combination works flawlessly under
2.6.1.
Please let me know what additional information I should provide. 
Thanx!
