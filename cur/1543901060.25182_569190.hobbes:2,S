According to some reports, and a quick test I did on my laptop, this 
same method appears to work on the ICH4 chipset, even though the HPET is 
not documented on that chipset. Does Intel have any info on HPET support 
on ICH4 and whether there's any reason we should not force enable it 
there as well?
