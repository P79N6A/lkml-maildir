Ok, "ethtool -K eth0 rx off tx off sg off tso off" should have turned it 
  all off.

No... I have some servers that are running just 2.6.16-xen (no bugfix 
patches) for 30 days without a problem, some of these have rulesets 
larger than the ones that crash daily. I'd estimate this affects 90% of 
my servers, just some reboot daily and others can make it to 7-10 days.
Thanks,
