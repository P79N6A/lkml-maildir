Hi Greg,
you advised me to use the "class" sysfs category which I did. But I've 
read at LWN that there is a long-term plan to get rid of this category 
altogether. So may I ask you the same question I asked some time ago.
UBI works on top of MTD devices. MTD device may perfectly well support 
the device/driver/bus model. But how this model does not really fit UBI 
because we have no bus.
Please, advice me, should I keep using the "class" category which seems 
fine for me or should I use the device/driver/bus stuff? What do I do 
with bus then? I tried this some time ago and things did not work with 
NULL bus.
Thanks,
Artem.
