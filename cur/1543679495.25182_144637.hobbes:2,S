Thanks, I see.  With -ac4 it looks like there is a new SATA
driver and the SATA devices appear as /dev/scdn.
With this new change does the BIOS (on an Intel 875P / ICH5
motherboard) still need the drives to be set to legacy mode, or can
it be set to enhanced mode to access the full complement of SATA
and PATA devices?
