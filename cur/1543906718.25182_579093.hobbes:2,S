Glad you chimed in, Chuck. I was wondering about it... I saw something
like 3 reports about broken printers, two of them for the same printer,
Samsung ML-2010. It's on the installed base of 300,000 to 500,000.
People simply do not report squat. Today DaveJ said that none of his
printers work, which sounds bad, and was news to me. But the point is,
we are trying to extrapolate from too few cases.
I am wondering if Ubuntu has better user reporting, so if Matthew
complains, it really means something.
