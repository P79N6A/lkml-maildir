My Compaq laptop, a Presario 2200, has video lockups using suspend to 
disk and a dead system everytime I use it. I don't
think its fud. I also conceed its not Linux's fault most of the time. 
These vendors put Windows specific hardware support
into these systems. My laptop has a dozen strange keys that work only on 
Windows and if you push one of them in Linux,
the system looses state with the keyboard and croaks ( have to reboot to 
recover). If I close the lid of my latop or do any other
suspend to disk state, the video display is croaked.
