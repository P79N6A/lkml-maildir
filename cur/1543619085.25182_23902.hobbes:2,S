Yes. I suspect that it can be trivially hidden in just two
architecture-specific functions, ie something like "detach_pgd(pgd)" and
"attach_pgd_entry(mm, address)".

Right. We'd get a few "unnecessary" page faults, but they should be on the
order of 0.1% of the necessary ones. In fact, with pre-faulting in
sys_fork(), I wouldn't be surprised if the common case is to not have any
directory-related page faults at all.
