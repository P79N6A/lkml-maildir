If you use a standard configuration, you can use a precompiled 
kernel as well.
Sorry I don't buy this. The point of the kernel configuration 
is to also allow non-standard configurations. Think about it:
the standard pc (PC99 or whatever it is called this year) doesn't
have a PS/2 port, only USB. So we can remove even the question 
from the config system, no?
