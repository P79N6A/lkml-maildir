Wait a minute.  Is that just a blanket search-and-replace job?  There is
a reason why cli/sti is marked obsolete instead of being silently #define'd
that way.  Namely, in a lot of cases users of cli/sti are actually racy.
For such instances replacing these with local_... would not improve anything
(obviously) *and* would hide a trouble spot by silencing a warning.
I'm not familiar with the architectures in question, so it might very well
be that all replacements so far had been correct.  However, I would really
like to see rationale for each of those warning removals to go along with
the patches.
Note that basically you are doing "remove the warning in foo.c:42 and
keep the current behaviour".  The missing part is "current behaviour is,
in fact, correct in that place and does not deserve a warning because
<list of reasons>".
