Argh, now I am wearing a double bag for extra strength.
The dependency "modules: include/config/MARKER" is not right.  Your
patch as described will not work with parallel builds.  My patch as
posted is even worse; it won't work with singular builds (I just
completely botched my test process).
The include/config/MARKER dependency has to kick in before each of
the subdirectories gets made.
Try *this* patch please.
Michael
