Calculating these values at runtime would have been completely insane, the 
alternative would be a crummy approximation, so using a lookup table is 
actually a good thing. That's not the problem.
BTW could someone please verify the prio_to_wmult table, especially [16] 
and [21] look a little off, like a digit was cut off.
While I'm at this, the 10% scaling there looks a little much (unless there 
are other changes I haven't looked at yet), the old code used more like 
5%. This would mean a prio -20 task would get 98.86% cpu time compared to 
a prio 0 task, that was previously about the difference between -20 and 
19 (and it would have previously gotten only 88.89%), now a prio -20 task 
would get 99.98% cpu time compared to a prio 19 task.
The individual levels are unfortunately not that easily comparable, but at 
the overall scale the change looks IMHO a little drastic.
bye, Roman
