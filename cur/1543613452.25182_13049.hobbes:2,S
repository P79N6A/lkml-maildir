Stating the obvious: For any array with dimension [32] or [64], check
if the source code uses [NR_CPUS].  IMHO there is no point in trying to
make those arrays dynamic in size, you penalize the 99% of small
machines on the off chance that somebody is going to run single system
image Linux on a box with > 32/64 processors.  People using such large
machines can recompile the kernel with a new value of NR_CPUS.
As a separate problem, there are still places in the kernel which
assume the number of cpus can be represented in a bitmap of type long.
That code would be worth tracking down and changing to remove the
assumption that NR_CPUS <= 8*sizeof(long).  Until that is done, you
cannot run SSI Linux on machines with > 32/64 processors.
Note to self: after the bitmap code limit has been removed, make
NR_CPUS a config option to get ready for huge machines, make
CONFIG_NR_CPUS a critical config option.
