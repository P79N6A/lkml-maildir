I think a better solution would be to finally switch to auto generated
system call tables for newer system calls. The original reason why the
architectures have different system call numbers -- compatibility with
another "native" Unix -- is completely obsolete now. This leaves only
minor differences of compat stub vs non compat stub and a few
architecture specific calls.
Of course the existing syscall numbers can't be changed, but for all new 
calls one could just add automatically for everybody.
A global table with two entries (compat and non compat) and a per arch 
override table should be sufficient.
Comments?
