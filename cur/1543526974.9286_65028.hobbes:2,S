Correct. What I meant is that it's not a bug in the 2.2.14aa7.gz patch. It
may be as well a 2.2.14 official bug of course (but more likely to be
another race in the lowlatency patch).
BTW, I just found another lowlatency patch bug:
-
+               /*
+                * Tough one to time-limit ...
+                */
                entry = entry->next;
-               if (!CAN_UNUSE(INODE(tmp)))
+               if (!CAN_UNUSE(INODE(tmp))) {
+                       if (current->need_resched) {
+                               INODE(tmp)->i_count++;
+                               spin_unlock(&inode_lock);
+                               schedule();
+                               spin_lock(&inode_lock);
+                               INODE(tmp)->i_count--;
+                       }
                        continue;
+               }
i_count-- won't release the inode correctly (think if the inode got
deleted under the schedule).
Drop the above changes and try again.
