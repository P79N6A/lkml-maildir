In that case the problem is unsolvable.  What if I named a process
\n+++ATH0\n
?  Oh dear, your modem just hung up.  Or maybe:
\n+++AT&C0\n
and now your modem always sets DCD active, so even with detection of DCD
in the kernel, I can now talk to it via process names after I've forced
it to disconnect.
And yes, there's modems out there which accept that and act on the '+++'
immediately - no pause after '+++' required.
