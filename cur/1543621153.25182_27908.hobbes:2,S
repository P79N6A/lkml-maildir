If you are going to build the same kernel you don't need *a* kernel source
code tree, you need the same kernel source code tree. Anyone who has
turned off an option because it had a bug in one kernel release will
assure you that config files for one kernel are not always safe or
functional on another.
I didn't think anyone would take that literally, I was making the point
that the config is "necessary but not sufficient" to borrow an engineering
term, and that the config is not the whole solution.
Did you build your mail reader with the sarcasm and hyperbole detector
option off?
