The ancient tradition of Unix is that read() is allowed to return as many bytes
as it wants (0 < bytes read <= bytes asked for).  Mostly it can return the
exact number you ask for when you read files from disk, but sometimes it
doesn't.  Programs just have to deal with it.
Note that /proc/<pid>/maps *does* have a record-oriented structure, and that's
just the nature of the beast.
