No such restriction on ARM.

Also not true.  The architectural implementation is:
	ldrex: tags the _physical_ address + cpu number,
		transitions to exclusive access.
	strex: if in exclusive access state and matches the previous
		tagged physical address + cpu number pair, store
		succeeds.
This is typically implemented in hardware, and in the case of a SMP
system, external to the CPU cores themselves.  So all it's doing is
looking at the exclusive accesses.  It is not embedded into the CPU
core so that micro-architectural stuff affects it.

That is a problem that we're facing, and the solution is rather simple.
You need to introduce a CPU-number specific number of cycles before
retrying the operation on failure.

I utterly disagree.  I could code atomic_add() as:
extern void cpu_specific_delay(void);
static inline int atomic_add_return(int i, atomic_t *v)
{
	do {
		asm("ldrex %0, [%1]" : "=r" (val) : "r" (v));
		val += i;
		asm("strex %0, %1, [%2]" : "=r" (res) : "r" (val), "r" (v));
		if (res)
			cpu_specific_delay();
	} while (res);
	return val;
}
and actually we /are/ going to have to go down this path to break the
livelock problem, like it or not.  Ditto for the ARM bitops operations,
so we might as well have ARM at least implement a generic ll/sc thing.
Coding the cpu specific delays into every strex site is going to make
them far too heavy to put inline.

Buggerit then.  cmpxchg sucks as an interface, and I am going to
continue to assert that.
