They are a reasonable addition to the list library.  They
should be implemented as:
/*
 * kernel-doc description goes here
 */
static inline struct list_head *list_first(struct list_head *list)
{
	if (list_empty(list))
		return NULL;
	return list->next;
}
But it shouldn't be quietly snuck in as part of epoll.   Everyone in
the world uses list.h.
Given that they are used in just a handful of places in epoll and nowhere
else in the kernel it is a little hard to justify adding them.
Unless people leap out and say "I've always wanted one of them" it would
be best to redo epoll to use
	while (!list_empty(list)) {
		item = list_entry(list, ...);
		list_del(item->list);
		...
	}
or one of the other eighty-seven list helpers which we already have.
