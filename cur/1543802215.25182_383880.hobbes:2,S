Ok, with that patch the page, flags, mapping, mapcount & count
information prints again.
I get the exact same backtrace as before though, but a slightly
different hexdump :
Bad page state in process 'kded'
page:c1e75400 flags:0x00000000 mapping:00000000 mapcount:1 count:0
Trying to fix it up, but a reboot is needed

One more note: the first time I booted the kernel with this patch X
failed to start. It started and blacked out the screen, at that point
the system hung, but not completely, I could still switch tty with
ctrl+alt+f? but all tty's I switched to were also completely black
with just a cursor in the top left corner. The system never recovered
from this state and I was forced to press the reset button.
The second time it booted up fine and launched kdm as usual to let me
log in and upon logging in it crashed as expected while launching KDE
(at that point I had switched over to tty1 and captured the crash dump
you see above).
So, it seems to me that we may have more than one bug.
