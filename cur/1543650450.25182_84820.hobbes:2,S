That's what is going to happen.  The initramfs image is completely 
removed from RAM after all this occurs, combined with moving code out of 
the kernel to early userspace, is how the overall kernel size shrinks.
Looking at a kernel cleanliness perspective, mounting root, unpacking 
initrd images, etc. get more and more complex -- with one simply copying 
userspace code into the kernel to get the job done.  In order to do NFS 
root for example, the kernel has an internal BOOTP and DHCP client, to 
snag an IP.  This mess simply does not belong in the kernel.  Never did.

The absolutely smallest possible code is - unpack a cpio archive onto a

If you want to support initrd --in kernel-- you must add in much more 
code:  ram disk device, and filesystem of your choice 
(minix/ext2/whatever).  _Any_ initrd code in the kernel is quite simply 
too much.  It doesn't matter how much you clean up the do_mounts.c code, 
"zero bytes" will always be smaller :)

As promised above, I do apologize for jumping all over you.  :)  I 
should have much more tact and approach posts with a more educational 
perspective.
Further, if you are patient with _me_, I think I can explain how 
initramfs can (a) keep your existing initrd images working just fine or 
(b) help you shrink your startup images even more.
