I thought all this mail processing could be done in the mailserver
and/or mail reader.  Why detect spam by looking for generic file
creation when you can trivially tap into mail as it arrives?
As for the non-existent virus problem - it is mostly prevented
by users not being administrators.  And you can go further
with a readonly /usr and a noexec /home.
