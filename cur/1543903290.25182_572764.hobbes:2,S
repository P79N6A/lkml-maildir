It did not need to be exported in this patch.
I have a couple of follow-on patches that cleaned up some header-file
dependencies and made is_global_init() inline. Those patches are
changing a bit as I merge them with Pavel Emelianov's pid ns changes.
I will send a separate patch to inline is_global_init().
