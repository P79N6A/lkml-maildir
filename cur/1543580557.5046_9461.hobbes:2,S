Subject: PATCH: linux-2.4.1/drivers/acpi/amfldio.c will fail if bit_granularity==32

	I hope this bug was not the result of my cc'ing Linus
on some emails and not on others, because this bug is a mistake
that I made a few weeks ago and then fixed when it was immediately
pointed out to me by some smart person on the acpi list.
	The test "((1 << bit_granularity) -1) & ~mask" will always
fail on x86+gcc if bit_granularity == 32, because the value of 1<<32
on x86 + gcc-2.95.2 is 1, not 0.  The value of 1<<n is not defined
in ANSI C when n >= bitsizeof(result), so we should not do this anyhow.
	Anyhow, here is a patch that should fix the problem.
