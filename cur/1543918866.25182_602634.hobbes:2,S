even if it were true (which it isnt), that is not an argument against 
including a useful change that exists now and that people are interested 
in. (and yes, i have implemented kernel console improvements in the past 
and vga scrollback support was in fact amongst one of my first ever 
Linux kernel hacks so your comment is doubly wrong.)

your arguments are not an answer to my technical points, which i'll 
repeat here:

today's console code development goes in exactly the opposite direction: 
we are including (formerly-) user-space console functionality in the 
kernel so that we can for example print oopses even if we are in X mode.

yes, a 'NAK' has a particular meaning on lkml.

by writing a quick email expressing your opinion and waiting to see the 
discussion play out itself ...
but it is very rude to 'NAK' a patch and it should only be done 
carefully.
