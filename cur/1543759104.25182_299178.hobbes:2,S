This is exactly how distributions work (or are at least supposed to). As 
such, it's not something _I_ care about, except in the sense of "yes, 
that's how you guys should do it". The reason I personally don't care any 
more is that it has the back- and forward-port issues, so somebody will 
have to do that, and it sure ain't me.
Now, if you are arguing that it should be something where different 
distributions do it together and don't waste engineers on their own tree, 
I do kind of agree. "Kind of", because I think different distributions 
have different issues (like timing), and that it may well just be too much 
work to try to synchronize them and keep everybody happy.
At some point it's easier and cheaper to just "waste energy". I see my job
as giving a base-line where somebody _can_ start doing the above, but at 
some point it's out of my hands.
