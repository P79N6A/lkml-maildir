For the record, this is the output from a run on our ARM machine (32
MB RAM) with 2.6.18 + the following patches:
   mm: tracking shared dirty pages
   mm: balance dirty pages
   mm: optimize the new mprotect() code a bit
   mm: small cleanup of install_page()
   mm: fixup do_wp_page()
   mm: msync() cleanup
It is at all suprising that the second offset within a page can be
less than the first offset within a page ? e.g.
