As including O_EXCL would disallow to use more than one cdrecord
program at the same time, there is no chance for the mains stream source.

Well the big difference with Solaris is that several modifications have been 
applied by Sun to the vold sub-system on Solaris in order to decently 
support cdrecord.
The last change was done with Nevada Build 21 in August 2005.
It makes sense for Linux not to ignore CD/DVD writing. Solaris also did
chose not to ignore cdrecord.
