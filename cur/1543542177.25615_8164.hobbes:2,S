Subject: Bug report: sbpcd.o module in 2.4.0-test6 ignores sbpcd= arg

System: PII-400, 128MB RAM, Asus P2B-F mobo, Creative Labs SB16 MCD
sound/CD interface card, Panasonic model CR-562 (old 2x proprietary
interface) CD-ROM drive.
When built into the kernel, the sbpcd driver uses the boot prompt
"sbpcd=0x250,1" (or "sbpcd=0x250,SoundBlaster") properly and finds
my Panasonic CR-562 CD-ROM drive fine.
When build as a module and inserted using modprobe or insmod,
sbpcd.o ignores the "sbpcd=0x250,1" argument string.  Instead it
probes 0x340,SoundBlaster *exactly*twice* then fails.  I observed
the same behavior in the (late) 2.3 kernels.
Please contact me directly for more info or any testing.  Thanks.
