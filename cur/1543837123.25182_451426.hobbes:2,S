SELinux is just revalidating access to the tty when the task changes
contexts upon execve, and resetting the tty if the task is no longer
allowed to use it.  Likewise with the open file descriptors that would
be inherited.  No clearing of the ttys of other tasks required as far as
SELinux is concerned, although that might not fit with normal semantics.
