Ok lets take it one step further then ;-)
On SMP cli(), save_flags() etc. are really expensive as they need to
synchronize across all processors. Therefore using save_flag();cli()
... restore_flags(); in time critical code is a very bad idea.
In the past, before we had spin locks, we used to do it as a quick way
to avoid anybody else fiddling with a data structure while we were
messing with it, however this is now in a way coming back to bite us.
So for time critical code it is a very good idea to look at
spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_unlock_irqrestore() - they will disable
interrupts on the local processor take a spin lock thus not blocking
the other processors until they try to get beyond the lock in
question. For UP machines they will simply turn into the old
save_flags();cli();/restore_flags(); set.
