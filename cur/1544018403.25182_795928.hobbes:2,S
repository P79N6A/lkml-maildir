Looks like the function graph tracer is only in 2.6.29, so I've updated
now to 2.6.29-rc2-00013-gf3b8436.
Again, a control test to make sure the problem still occurs:
--- hermes-old.wumi.org.au ping statistics ---
64 packets transmitted, 64 received, 0% packet loss, time 63080ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.168/479.893/4015.950/894.721 ms, pipe 5
Yes, plenty of delays there. Next, checking if I can reproduce with only
one core online:
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu2/online
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/online
...
--- hermes-old.wumi.org.au ping statistics ---
900 packets transmitted, 900 received, 0% packet loss, time 900253ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.127/38.937/2082.347/170.348 ms, pipe 3
--- hermes-old.wumi.org.au ping statistics ---
900 packets transmitted, 900 received, 0% packet loss, time 900995ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.127/428.398/17126.227/1634.980 ms, pipe 18
So it looks like I can do the simplified trace. I've run out of time for
that this morning, but I'll spend some time on it over the weekend.
Thanks for the detailed instructions - it doesn't look like it will be
too hard.
Cheers,
Kevin.
