One point before we start - MCP51 is nForce 5, not nForce 4 (which is CK804).
If my understanding is correct, acpi_use_timer_override is only a workaround 
required for those nForce 5 boards that don't enable the HPET for you.
So IIUC, you should be able to use either 'hpet=force' 
or 'acpi_use_timer_override', either of which should solve any timing issues 
you see, but you shouldn't need both (which should solve your problem of 
acpi_use_timer_override ignoring the HPET - it shouldn't be needed 
if 'hpet=force' enables the HPET).
