First of all: it's faster and doesn't burn a bunch of additional cpu
cycles like sys_ioctl and the large switch statements do.
Another thing is that this patch set already introduces a way to pass a
sigset. Passing a sigset to a device node is sort of strange.
In addition, if we would port kvm to s390, then we would need to
make sure that each virtual cpu only gets executed from the thread
that created it. That is simply because the upper half of our page
tables contain information about the guest page states. This is yet
another thing that would be strange to do via an ioctl based interface.
Of course everthing can be done via an iotcl interface too, but IMHO
that's just the wrong interface.
