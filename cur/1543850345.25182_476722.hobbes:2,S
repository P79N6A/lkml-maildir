I'm glad, that semi-working thing was helpful. But it's ugly hack.
Idea is to substitute objects (*.o) with sparse output, thus targets
like
,--
|%.o : %.c
+--
will be updated and new check will pass them (force check may be applied).
Also having results in files (even in so messy called *.o) is good for
collecting and sorting errors. Headers will be generated as needed.
Finally short statistics maybe printed in the end of the check:
[(stat -c %s *.o > 0 | wc -l) / find --name *.o]
  ^ with error file size > 0  / overall error files
But implementing all this in non-hack way isn't easy. Maybe Sam will
came back and will do it magically quickly. Until that, i'll try to
fight with current makefiles myself.

I've found "sparse" and read some philosophy from README. Nice.
Thanks you also !
