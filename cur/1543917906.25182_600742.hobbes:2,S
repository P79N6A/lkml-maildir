Ehm, so you want people to save the patch, then when replying they
should load the patch into their (much better) mail client where they
can comment on the patch?  That is the reason the patch should be
inline.  People need to comment on it just as they would comment on any
other plain text email.
Well that and some people use git to import patches from the email in a
mostly automated way which also expects them to have the info at top
with signed-off and then the patch, which attachments also screw up.
So yes there are good reasons for getting a non broken mail client when
sending patches to lkml.
