As I said, I've been using it successfully.  I've not tested ide-floppy 
since I don't have one, nor a tape.  I would rather not have to use 
ide-scsi if I can help it.  ide cd support is incompatible with ide-scsi 
cdrom support, so things are simpler if I can just cut out the scsi 
support entirely.
