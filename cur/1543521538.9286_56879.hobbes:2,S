It saved some code for me, as I do not have to remember matroxfb instances
anymore - pci remembers them for me... And after I persuade friend with IBM
and hotplug PCI to compile matroxfb into kernel, I can try to hotswap 
matroxes... (but it is probably 2.5 task, as current diff between
my G400DH aware matroxfb and kernel is 482kB :-( )

If you want hide pci_dev->driver_data item from users, you can change probe
to void* (*probe)(struct pci_dev*) and define that NULL means failure and
non-NULL means success and should be stored in driver_data for 
remove/resume/suspend callbacks.

It looks like that I had enough free memory and enough luck when I tried 
that...

It looks reasonable for registration/unregistration, but you should
document it somewhere for pci_find* and pci_for_each_dev().
