In 2.3.47, isapnp fails to properly configure my ESS1868 sound card.
This worked perfectly in 2.3.46.
The card still works if i use isapnp by hand.
If i can provide more information, let me know.
--------------------------------------------------
foobar:~# dmesg |grep pnp
isapnp: Scanning for Pnp cards...
isapnp: Card 'ESS ES1868 Plug and Play AudioDrive'
isapnp: 1 Plug & Play card detected total
foobar:~#
-------------------------------------------------- 
It looks like it detected it, but it gives me the usual device busy if i try
to modprobe sb io=0x220 .......  w/out using isapnp by hand.
