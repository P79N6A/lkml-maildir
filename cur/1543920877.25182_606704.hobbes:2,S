btw, this changes ext2's on-disk format.
a) is the ext2 format documented anywhere?  If so, that document will
   need updating.
b) what happens when an old ext2 driver tries to read and/or write this
   directory entry?  Do we need a compat flag for it?
c) what happens when old and new ext3 or ext4 try to read/write this
   directory entry?
