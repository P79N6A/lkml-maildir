That makes it much easier.  When we tried this, we were going for
strict priority.  Therefore, you either had a really large number
of queues, or you had to scan all tasks on individual queues.  Again,
we were trying to maintain existing behavior.  In hind sight, this
doesn't look like a smart design constraint. :)
