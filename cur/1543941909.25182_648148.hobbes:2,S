Ok, then it doesn't help that it's not busy.
In that case, the only real fix is to simply do the ACPI reservations 
*after* PCI probing. Which is what it should have done to begin with.

No. Don't add quirks just because the basic ordering is shit.

So? Do the bridge listing separately from resource marking. Why tie the 
two together? They have absolutely *nothing* to do with each other.
The fact is, scanning devices should happen first. And AFTER the device 
tree is scanned, we can then safely add all the special resources that 
don't show up as normal devices.
