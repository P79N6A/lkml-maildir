We've been busily reverting new power management patches and it's likely
that we fixed this one in the past day or so.  So please test 2.6.13-rc6
when it comes out, or 2.6.13-rc5-git3 which is about three hours away,
thanks.
If it still happens please add the below patch so we can work out the
offending device.  Or apply it anyway - we may have a buggy driver which
will just bite us again later.
Thanks.
