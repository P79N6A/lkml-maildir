So how should the header files for an ioctl interface to a driver be
handled then?  It seems like a waste of energy to have two keep one
file for userspace use and one for kernel use, especially since the
two have to be kept in sync.
For example, setserial.c has the following includes:
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <termios.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <errno.h>
    ...
    #include <asm/ioctls.h>
    #include <linux/serial.h>
I know it's not entirely kosher, but the alternative seems worse to me.
