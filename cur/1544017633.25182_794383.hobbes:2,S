Yes, kvm has non-interface stuff in <linux/kvm_host.h>, so there's at 
least some separation.  All of <linux/kvm.h> is needed by userspace.
What's more painful to me in this area is advertising what's exported.  
Right now userspace has to rely on the kernel version to see what 
features are supported, but that doesn't work if a feature is backported 
or removed.  KVM has KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION which I'd love to see standardized.
