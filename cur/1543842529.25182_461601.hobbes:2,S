Is that in a spec somewhere?  Otherwise, I would argue that it isn't 
_known_ to come right after the argument string, it just _happens_ to 
come right after the argument string.  This could change in future kernels.

True, but that's an arbitrary limitation which I'm in the process of 
removing.  I have a new version of proc_pid_cmdline() which will return 
the entire commandline buffer no matter what its length.  If the 
grab-more-data-from-environment-buffer behavior is actually broken, I'd 
rather not propagate it to the new code.
