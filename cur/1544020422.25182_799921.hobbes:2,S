the warning wouldnt have been added if it didnt make sense ... like it
says, prototypes for kernel functions make no sense in userspace
headers
as for how it gets solved, we can either patch it manually or
automatically delete the prototypes ... but since prototypes are a big
difficult to match properly with regexes, the former will probably be
saner right now.
