Please Rik, could you explain what you mean with "reclaim swap space when we run out".
In my (limited) understanding, when there's no more free memory (ram and swap space), the kernel starts to kill process (and the choice is a difficult point).
Are you proposing to add an API to reclaim swap instead of killing process ?
Other thing (certainly related) what is supposed to have changed between 2.2 and 2.4.
Thanks,
Christophe
