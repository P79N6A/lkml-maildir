I sent this patch to linux-kernel some month ago.
The line it modifies is the only preventing one from booting
with nfsroot over pointopoint links (i tested it only for
PLIP, however, but it should work even with SLIP).

I think it would be reasonable to put it into the official Linux tree.
Thank you for your attention.
