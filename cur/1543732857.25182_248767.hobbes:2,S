Thanks for the feedback. This doesn't explain, though, why on 2.4.x and
2.2.x sometimes sensible results are reported and sometimes not and it
doesn't explain the results I got with a simple pthread test case on 2.6.8.1.
[...doing more testing...]
See the attached test case: the results reported are:
$ gcc test-thread-rusage.c -lpthread
$ time ./a.out join
using a subthread
done
real	0m1.469s
user	0m1.461s
sys	0m0.003s
$ time ./a.out sleep
using a subthread
real	0m1.007s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s
So it looks like times for subthreads are accounted for, but only when
the thread is joined (or if it is given time to properly exit). I guess
Roland's patch takes care of the case when a subthread is destroyed by
exiting from main() as well?
A little tracing shows that the intermittent 2.4/2.2 results and the
always low timings on 2.6 are probably due to the main program exiting
before the subthread cleaned up after itself (the results are
intermittent because it's a timing issue: we just wait for the subthread
to finish it's work and it's preempted away before it has a chance of
calling pthread_exit()).
Thanks.
