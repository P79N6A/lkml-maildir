Hello,
the following happens quite often on the first access of a CD (audio and 
data). Anyone know what it means? The process accessing the CD hangs for 
about 15 seconds or so, then the system freezes for 1-2 seconds and then 
everything works like a charm.

The drive is an LG GCC-4120B DVD/CD-RW drive attached to a VIA vt8235 
controller, 2nd channel, single drive. Using ide-scsi emulation. The problem 
is harmless though. At least it hasn't caused any further problems.
