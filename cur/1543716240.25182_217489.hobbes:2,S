1. Red Hat bugs go to 
http://bugzilla.redhat.com
2. Except in this case, you're running a distro that's
   reached end of life, so is unsupported.
3. There were a few dozen errata kernels after that kernel
   that you should try. The last 8.0 kernel was something
   like 2.4.20-24 or so.. Googling for the Fedora legacy
   project should also find you backports of the RHL9 kernels
   that were done after the end of life of RHL 8.0
