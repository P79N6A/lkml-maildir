The LSM access control hooks all return 0 on success (i.e. permission
granted) and negative error code on failure, like most of the rest of
the kernel interfaces (e.g. consider permission()).  Hence, the
security_capable() hook returns 0 when the capability is granted to the
specified task.  Naturally, the capable() function (which now internally
calls security_capable) preserves the old interface, and most callers
still invoke it rather than directly calling security_capable(). 
However, the oom killer code is performing a capability test for a task
other than current; hence, it makes a direct call to the
security_capable() hook that supports passing a particular task, unlike
the capable() function.
