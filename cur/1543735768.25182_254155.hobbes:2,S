Actually, major 95 has never been used for VM minidisks or any other
s390 block device in any 2.4 or 2.6 based distribution, because that
driver was integrated into the dasd driver (it just uses a different
access method on the same devices). You might want to document that
this number is currently unused, even if it doesn't get assigned to
any other driver.
