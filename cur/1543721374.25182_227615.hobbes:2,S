Hmm...
I dont agree with the 'TCP' word here : listen() system call is not tied 
with TCP, isn't it ?
I would suggest :
+somaxconn - INTEGER
+	Limit of socket listen() backlog, known in userspace as SOMAXCONN.
+	Defaults to 128. See also tcp_max_syn_backlog for additional tuning for TCP sockets.

Thank you
