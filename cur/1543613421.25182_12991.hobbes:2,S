Use sym53c8xx_2 instead. This one uses 2 different firmwares,
- one based on sym53c8xx driver scripts called
  'LOAD/STORE based' firmware,
- and another one that only uses generic scripts instructions
  and called 'GENERIC' firmware.
The GENERIC firmware has worked for me witn a 810 rev. 2.
I haven't this controller installed at the moment, but I can test the
driver by forcing the driver to use the GENERIC scripts instead for any
symbios chip.
You may let me know if sym53c8xx_2 still works with 810 rev 2.

The ncr53c8xx and sym53c8xx version 1 use the obsolete scsi eh handling.
Moving the eh code from sym53c8xx_2 (version 2) to ncr53c8xx/sym53c8xx is
quite feasible, but may-be it is just useless given sym53c8xx_2. For now,
it seems that sym53c8xx_2 replaces both ncr/sym53c8xx without any loss of
reliability and performance.

You are welcome and you didn't break any etiquette. The lkml is a very
open mailing list but it gets more than 200 postings a day. Thus the
linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org list should be preferred for topics that
address scsi specifically.
