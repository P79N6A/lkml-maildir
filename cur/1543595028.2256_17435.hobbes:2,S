Hi
What may happen on a SMP machine if a serial port has been closed and the
closing stage is at shutdown() in serial.c in the call to free_IRQ  and
BEFORE the IRQ is really shutdown, a new character arrives which causes an
IRQ? Is it possible that the OTHER cpu  takes this interrupt and causes a
crash?
