Indeed.
I think these messages are due to X using the mprotect workaround to
change UC_MINUS to WB.
I don't see these error messages on my 965 here. May be I have different
x version.
What may be happening:
1) process A mmaps /dev/mem and gets UC_MINUS
2) Changes the page table to make pg_prot WB
3) Does a fork to create process B
4) While copying the vma, we go through map_devmem request WB, but get
UC_MINUS back
5) We are not changing vma pg_prot to new value at this point (we should
change this), so one more round of errors will be there when forked
process exits.
Again, this should not have any side-effect like the band etc. It just a
"friendly warning". It should go away when X moves to using WC or does
not use the mprotect workaround to make pg_prot WB.
Thanks,
