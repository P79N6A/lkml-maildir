In linux.kernel you write:

lmsensors might be correct here as there is a sample config from Tyan
for my board.  C2_cnt shows that amd76x_pm is indeed working. 
Otherwise I had expected a much higher temperature.

Did that.

Bingo! Currently running 2.6.5-mm1 at 42.0/43.5°C!

Wouldn't be a bad idea to document this :-)
Thanks!
