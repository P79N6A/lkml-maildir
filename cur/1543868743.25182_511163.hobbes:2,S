Right, and they say it's compatible with "EPIA mini-ITX family".
That means the mappings I just outlined should apply to all of them.
BTW: any "universal" dual+ PCI riser card have to use a PCI bridge
chip, and a bridge isn't a small 20 pin IC (I'd expect 144 pins or
so). "Active" or "passive" - doesn't matter.
