The German decision did not go anywhere near the question of kernel
modules. It was a nice victory that the court decided the license was
enforceable, but the details of the license are still largely
untested.

Note that it's not just "lucy", but "rich". Both sides would spend a
LOT of money if this went to court in the US. And, of course, "the
terms of the software [license]" are exactly what the case would be
deciding. There wouldn't be a case unless the two parties had
different views of the terms of the license.

I also ANAL, but even so I can point out that your assertion and Greg
KH's assertions do not have the force of law.  Questions like "what is
a derived work" and "what does 'unrelated' mean" in the license are
just not black-and-white.
I don't like niggling about interpretation, either, especially with
material that someone has contributed to the community; I think it's
rude and possibly unethical and that not testing the limits avoids any
danger of impropriety. But claiming it's clear what the license
requires is simply misleading.
