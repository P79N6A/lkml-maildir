Some of that is due to data structures, but most certainly could be 
factored out, and really should be.  Since, apparently, klibc got 
rejected for 2.6.18 we have some time to improve that situation.
For total size reasons I'm pretty sure we need to still provide a single 
binary.  The trunk code, however, needs to be clean enough that it can 
be easily modified, too.
