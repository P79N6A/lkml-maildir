Look at the call paths for the drivers coming from Space.c...  Most of
the NIC drivers that do the above are ISA drivers, where they are always
provided a device struct.  I believe that we can change the above to
	if (dev == NULL)
		BUG ();

I think so..  I do know that if init_etherdev() is required, you must
also kfree() in the module_exit() function.  Since this case is so rare
(AFAICS), most drivers don't handle this case, and never call kfree at
all.
-If- init_etherdev is required at all (I think it is not), then you
would need a flag...  You would need two flags, if you want to handle
the case where dev->priv is allocated manually, versus allocated in
init_etherdev.
	if (dev == NULL) {
		dev = init_etherdev (0, 0);
		if (!dev) return -ENOMEM;
		tp->have_dynamic_netdev = 1;
	}
