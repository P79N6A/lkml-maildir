I fail to see what part of that reply was rude in any way.  It simply
offered a perfectly valid suggestion.
Just because people give you something other than what you want, does
not make them rude.
It is also quite likely the reply was written before reading the other
comments.  With the volume on lkml, reading all comments in a thread
before writing any replies is just not possible.
