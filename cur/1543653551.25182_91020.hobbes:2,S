Hi,
I have a sony vaio qr10 and I use the sonypi driver.
If I boot the screen output will stop during acpi init and the notebook boots 
(but no screen output). I can use vnc but....
I think this also happens in 2.4, 2.5 isn't better in this.
I will try to build the kernel without sonypi (never done that) maybe it 
helps.
have fun
Felix
