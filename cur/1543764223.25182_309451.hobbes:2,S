Fair enough.  How does this sound?  I'd like to add "*attach" and
"*detach" to "struct device_driver".  These functions would act as one
time initializers and decontructors.  Then we could rename "*probe" to
"*start", and "*remove" to "*stop", which should be rather trivial to
fix up.  From there drivers could slowly be converted to use "*attach"
and "*detach", but will not be broken along the way.
So the basic flow would be like this:
1.) a driver is bound to a device
2.) *attach is called to allocate data structures
3.) *start when it's time to probe the device
4.) *stop when the user disables the device
5.) repeat steps 3 and 4 any number of times
6.) *detach is called when unbinding the driver
The driver layering stuff could come later, but just implementing these
specific components would have immediate benefits.
In this early stage in development, I'd like to at least be able to
start and stop drivers for reasons outside of power management (ex. user
preference or resource re-balancing).  If a "*resume" function can also
utilize this functionality, then all the better.
Thanks,
Adam
