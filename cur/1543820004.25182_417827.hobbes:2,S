- Where is the user of the cap_extra hook?  I don't see it in multiadm.
If you aren't using it, it isn't a requirement for multiadm, obviously;
you should drop those diffs out and just focus on what you need for
multiadm itself.
- Writing a security module based on function names in other modules is
obviously very fragile; some kind of abstraction would be required.

I wasn't suggesting passing the union of their parameters, just the ones
that are actually used by your module (plus any parameters used by any
other in-tree user, i.e. capability and SELinux).  And trying to
abstract a higher level conceptual operation as the hook rather than
making them per-syscall/operation.  I know that LSM currently does
things the other way, but I'd much rather see it move toward more
general permission checking interfaces (ala the internal SELinux ones,
although I understand those specific interfaces aren't what you would
use).  Others may have a different POV.

At least for common cases like permission(9) and ipcperms(9), the
security hook call comes after the DAC checking.  But not always.
Sounds like you want authoritative hooks, which were discussed and
experimented with during LSM development, see archives.  You could
attempt to revive that for the cases where you need it, moving the
checking into the commoncap functions (defining new ones where needed,
and making sure that existing modules call them so that they still apply
those checks) and calling those functions rather than duplicating the
logic in your own module.  You presumably don't want to have to maintain
the duplicated logic in your own module.
