let me ask this:
Has anmyone ever had the desire to change the default of 1 day of
relatime? Ever?
Maybe this code isn't really needed if nobody even thought about
changing it.
Clearly there are two extremes (always and never) for which we have
atime/noatime. I'm not sure we need to have any smarts in the middle
point for the user to change. If this is something people wish to see
tuned better, I would rather spend the code size in trying to get it
autotuning.
