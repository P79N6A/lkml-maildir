Is software suspend in Vanilla 2.5.60 supposed to work? A modified shutdown
(using the reboot(2) magic) triggers the BUG_ON in idedisk_suspend. A quick
check with older 2.5.x indicates this problem has been around for a while.
I can provide additional information incl. call trace if anyone's
interested.
