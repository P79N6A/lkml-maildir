HPA mishandling is a given, I agree that is a nasty problem and really
should be fixed. hangs on resume - the hardware, or the kernel talking
to it? crc errors sounds like bad transfer tuning after resume, but that
should be pretty identical to the on-boot one.
The low level drivers/ide drivers aren't well geared for suspend/resume,
perhaps that is what is causing most of these issues (apart from hpa).
