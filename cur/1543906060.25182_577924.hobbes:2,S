Probably not exactly so...

So, according to this netpoll could presume NETDEVICES and
NET_POLL_CONTROLLER are always on.
But, as you've found, it's possible to select NETPOLL and !NETDEVICES,
so this comment is at least not precise.
On the other side something like this:
...
endif # NETDEVICES
config NETPOLL
        depends on NETDEVICES
        def_bool NETCONSOLE
config NETPOLL_TRAP
        bool "Netpoll traffic trapping"
        default n
        depends on NETPOLL
config NET_POLL_CONTROLLER
        def_bool NETPOLL
        depends on NETPOLL
seems to select NET_POLL_CONTROLLER after selecting NETPOLL, but
still doesn't check for NETDEVICES dependency.

OK, I wasn't right here: there is no visible reason for both in the
kernel code, but I can imagine there could be some external users of
NET_POLL_CONTROLLER without NETPOLL.

This was kind of joking, but since some people prefer things to work,
and it's hard to do this right (logical) way, some strange (unlogical)
measures have to be done like repeating dependencies here.
