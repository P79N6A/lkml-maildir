   Have a look at my LFS patches.  There syscall is already
   there as:  getdents64.
	
ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/linux/LFS/
+/*
+ * New, some-improved getdents64() (for LFS) interface. 
+ */
+struct linux_dirent64 {
+	__u64		d_ino; /* 64-bit inode */
+	unsigned long	d_off; /* Offset within the directory */
+	unsigned short	d_reclen;
+	char		d_name[1];
+};
+
+struct getdents_callback64 {
+	struct linux_dirent64 * current_dir;
+	struct linux_dirent64 * previous;
+	int count;
+	int error;
+};
   That done (after you tell me which fields to add into that dirent),
   you have only the glibc side to do...  And what parameters to add
   to   sys_getdents64()  syscall.
   I have infact wondered, how many of stat64 parameters could be
   carried in to supply speeded up processing;  mode, size, mtime ?
   Full 'struct stat' ? (propably not)

	fs/readdir.c:  sys_getdents()  doesn't have user-space
	supplied flag parameter to control call behaviour.
	D'uh..  Must have separate call.
