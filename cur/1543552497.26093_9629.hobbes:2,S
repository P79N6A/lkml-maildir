If NT is doing better than Linux with UDP, it probably isn't using
UDP (maybe sequenced-packet). As you should know, UDP is not
a reliable transport mechanism, but the actual data transfer for
any/all machanisms is via "datagrams". The rest of the protocol
just determines whether or not reliable delivery is assured.
Why do you use UDP? If you need reliable transport you must use
TCP/IP (stream).
