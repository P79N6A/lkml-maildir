of course there is a way to find out, and that's why i mailed you: fix 
the hackbench regression and i'm quite sure you'll improve the TPC-C 
numbers as well. It shows the same kind of overhead in the profile and 
takes just a few seconds to run. Are your pending SLUB patches in 
2.6.24-rc5-mm1 already?
