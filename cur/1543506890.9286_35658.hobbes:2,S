1.  I get the following compiler warnings:
rz1000.c: In function `ide_probe_for_rz100x':
rz1000.c:90: warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value
rz1000.c:92: warning: suggest parentheses around assignment used as truth value
scsi.c:185: warning: `scsi_unregister_device' declared `static' but never defined
namei.c: In function `msdos_mkdir':
namei.c:365: warning: unused variable `de1'
namei.c:364: warning: unused variable `bh1'
irq.c:75: warning: excess elements in struct initializer after `irq_controller_lock'
fault.c: In function `do_page_fault':
fault.c:115: warning: `sem' might be used uninitialized in this function
Root device is (3, 8)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 1288 bytes.
System is 586 kB
2.  There are still issues with multiple inclusion of various sound.o
files (mpu401.o opl3.o, etc) which were mentioned in a previous email
from me regarding compiling 2.3.14.  Michael Chastain (sp?) sent me a
patch which fixes this.  He mentioned submitting it to Linus; I hope
this happens soon since it fixes my problem.
3.  I get messages I don't understand during bootup, apparently when
probing ide devices:
hdm: probing with STATUS(0x00) instead of ALTSTATUS(0xff)
hdm: IRQ probe failed (0)
hdm: probing with STATUS(0x00) instead of ALTSTATUS(0xff)
hdm: IRQ probe failed (0)
Here is the full dmesg output:
