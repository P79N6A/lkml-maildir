How about a simple and harmless test?
When an IDE disk is accessed for the first time, perhaps when
the partition table is read - issue a 256-sector read and see
what happens.  If it works - fine.  If not, tag the thing as
supporting max 255 sectors.
No wrecking of file systems, and full performance for
the vast majority.
