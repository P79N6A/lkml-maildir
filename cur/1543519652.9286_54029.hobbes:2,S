Like I said, then your distribution must be fixed.
On any glibc 2.0.7 system I have here, I can do an
"apt-get install libc6 libc6-dev gcc binutils" and everything will
be automatically upgraded to glibc 2.1.2 and the latest development
tools within minutes without breaking anything or without bringing
the system down.
Ofcourse I use the technically most advanced distribution ;)
Mike.
