Roman,
this is... a strange comment. It almost sounds like you were holding
the splitup hostage depending on some other thing happening.... that's
not a good attitude in my book. Having big-blob patches that do many
things at the same time leads to them being impossible to apply. Linux
works by having smaller incrementals. You know that; you've been around
for a long time.
Complaining that someone finally did splitup work after you refused,
and even puts credit in for you... that's beyond my comprehension.
Sorry.
