For me, 2.6.9-rc4.  I've tried every -rc and -mm since, and it cannot
resume.  (I get no video on resume, even with 2.6.9-rc4, until X
resumes, so I get no information what-so-ever, just a dead box.  That's
why I haven't reported this before.)
I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 (Centrino) with the nvidia card.
2.6.9-rc4 suspends and resumes fine, both to memory and disk.  Since
then, nothing has resumed from suspend-to-ram, but occasional versions
(such as 10-rc3-mm1) resumes from suspend-to-disk.
I can give any information that people want.
