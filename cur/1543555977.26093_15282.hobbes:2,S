   I know that there is no problem due to the way it is called in
   copy_files() -- it would only be above 32. But for what I want to
   use it, I need the _correct_ number of open file descriptors and
   not some "rounded up to 32" one.
That function is static for a reason :-)  It is not meant
for external use.  What it gives you is the smallest multiple
of (8 * sizeof(long)) which is larger than the largest file
descriptor the task has open.
What you want is something like:
static int num_open_files(struct files_struct *files, int size)
{
	total = 0;
	for (i = size / (8 * sizeof(long)); i > 0; )
		total += count_bits(files->open_fds->fds_bits[--i]);
	return total;
}
