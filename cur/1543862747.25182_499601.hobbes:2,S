No, ccr3 should be restored to protect some registers (or at least bit 4 
should be cleared in ccr3).
BTW:
In function set_cx86_inc()
[...]
	/* PCR1 -- Performance Control */
	/* Incrementor on, whatever that is */
	setCx86(CX86_PCR1, getCx86(CX86_PCR1) | 0x02);
	/* PCR0 -- Performance Control */
	/* Incrementor Margin 10 */
	setCx86(CX86_PCR0, getCx86(CX86_PCR0) | 0x04);
[...]
This setting is only valid for 200MHz...266MHz CPUs, for 300MHz and 333MHz 
CPUs the Incrementor Margin should be 1-1.
There is an AppNote about this setting:
AMD Geode GX1 Processor Memory Timings for Maximum Performance.
