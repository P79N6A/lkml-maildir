Really need to fix this properly to support both zones in mbind

That wouldn't solve the problem. The problem is that the mempolicy needs 
at least two zonelists to handle all type of allocations (that is why 
i added the concept of policy zone in the first place - to avoid the need
of multilevel zonelists in the policies)
Or maybe it's better to just don't do any policy for GFP_DMA32 
allocations and always use the highest zonelist. I guess they're somewhat
rare anyways and the policy will rarely succeed.
