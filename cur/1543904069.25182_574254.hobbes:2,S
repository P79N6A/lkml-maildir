    However, I found it strange that HPT374 against which was that bug report 
works with 66 MHz DPLL clock -- while I've recently forbidden that clock in 
the IDE driver because it was causing DMA timeouts.

    Heh, was quite a silly mistake. :-)

    OK, I'm seeing that the "oldie but goodie" calibration algrithm has 
finally found its way to the libata driver too. :-)
