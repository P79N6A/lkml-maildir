    Hi all :)
    I was wondering: is there any reason not to use ext2 on an USB
pendrive? Really my question is not only about USB pendrives, but any
device whose storage is flash based. Let's assume that the device has a
good quality flash memory with wear leveling and the like...
    Thanks a lot in advance :)
