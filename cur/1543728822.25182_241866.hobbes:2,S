I remain convinced that such a merging would be wrong headed.
When I examine the experience that other operating systems such as
Solaris, Unicos and Irix have had with resource share groups and
cpusets, they have considered these to be two distinct facilities,
correctly so in my view.
So I recommend that you not try to bend CKRM to include cpusets.
Unless others have more to say, I too am content to close this thread
for now.  I've email-bombed enough mail boxes for one week ;).
I'll have an updated cpuset patch, hopefully next week, hopefully
with a shorter Cc list this time, with a couple of modest fixes.
Thank-you.
