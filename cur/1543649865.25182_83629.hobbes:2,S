Hello Andrea,
[I tried to post the reply through groups.google.com, and it looks like it 
didn't get to lkml. :( ]

OK.
I have applied the patches 0* and the following patches in this order:
10_sched-o1-hyperthreading-3
20_apm-o1-sched-1
20_rcu-poll-7
20_sched-o1-fixes-5
21_o1-A4-aa-1
The resulting kernel is very stable and it does not crash.
Then I tried patches [01]* and the extra patches (20_apm-o1-sched-1,
20_rcu-poll-7, 20_sched-o1-fixes-5, 21_o1-A4-aa-1), I couldn't compile
the kernel.
Here is the current std_err:
