It is hard to get precise numbers, but I have the feeling that with atime 
enabled the ls-hiccups have at least not decreased, and there has been a 
rather long one of about 13 seconds, frequency is about one per minute, 
usually taking 2-4 seconds.
With noatime this of course doesn't happen, but with the patch the file 
size does not increase smoothly any more, it sometimes stays the same for 
some ten seconds and then jumps a few hundred MBs. However, the throughput 
is roughly the same as without the patch (compatible within the errors of 
about 10%).

Unfortunately I'm ordered to do something now, so I won't have the time to
check the performance of this one during the next few hours. The
combination of 01+02+04 seemed more stable (concerning sustained
throughput), so I will test it on all 12 machines and tell you what
happens.
Thanks very much for your help! I appreciate that!
Ciao,
