Hi guys,
My SCSI card didn't work anymore, my NIC was unable to connect and my SB
Live! didn't work anymore. I thought 2.5.8 was a huge mess :)
Anyway: ACPI sets up IRQ remapping to IRQs > 15, but all PCI devices claim
the old =< 15 IRQ's. My guess is that the ACPI code doesn't update the pci
irq data.
If it matters: The system I talk about is a dual PII 333, on an Intel LX
chipset. 2.5.6 did boot fine.
