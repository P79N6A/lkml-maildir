Wrong.  Some sleeps indicate "I have run out of stuff to do right now, I'm 
going to wait for a timer or another process or something to wake me up with 
new work".
Some sleeps indicate "ideally this would run on an enormous ramdisk attached 
to gigabit ethernet, but hard drives and internet connections are just too 
slow so my true CPU-hogness is hidden by the fact I'm running on a PC instead 
of a mainframe."
There is are "I have nothing to do right now, and I'm okay with that" sleeps, 
and there are "I have requested more work, and it should hurry up and get 
here" sleeps.
