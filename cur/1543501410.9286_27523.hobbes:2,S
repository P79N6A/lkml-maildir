i don't think that's much of a risk, actually.  i've used features like
this on mainframes and under Solaris for years, and never had a problem
like this.  it's easy to reboot a small program that does this, or have
logic that rereads the VTOC before dumping.  even so, you'd have to have a
pretty pathological kernel to experience something like this, IMO.
