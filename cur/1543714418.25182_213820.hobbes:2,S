The compiler is telling us that the condition is always false because a 32-bit
value can never have the codition being tested against a 64-bit one (TASK_SIZE).
I've tried everything to kill this warning, even casting both sides of the
conparison to 64-bit, but gcc can still see things clearly.
So just comment out the -Werror line in arch/sparc64/kernel/Makefile which is
how I'm (unfortunately) solving this for now.
