This is definitely a known problem. Several patches have been posted
for this and other problems with the scheduler:
2.4: Artur Skawina<skawina@geocities.com> and Dimitris Michailidis
<dimitris@cthulhu.engr.sgi.com>
2.2: George Anzinger <george@pioneer.net>
There might have been others which I missed. Ask the authors for the
latest version.
BTW your test progam was a bit garbled.
Regards,
Borislav
