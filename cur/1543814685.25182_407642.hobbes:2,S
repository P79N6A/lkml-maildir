Ick.  Is there really _no_ way to resize this at runtime?  I know it
isn't an immediately easy thing to do, but we've really tried not to do
these kinds of things with memory hotplug in the past.  The whole thing
would have been really easy if we could just preallocate everything
really big in the first place.
I don't think this has to be a super-fast, efficient, implementation.
Once the code has gone into the actual waitqueue code, it is already in
a slow path.  
We could do something like this:
void fastcall wait_on_page_bit(struct page *page, int bit_nr)
{
        DEFINE_WAIT_BIT(wait, &page->flags, bit_nr);
        if (!test_bit(bit_nr, &page->flags))
		return;
			
        while (__wait_on_bit(page_waitqueue(page), &wait, sync_page,
			TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE));
}
And have a special case inside of sync_page() to return -EAGAIN when a
waitqueue resize is going on.  There is a race there if zone->wait_table
and zone->wait_table_bits are not matching values.
So, to do the update, you'd need to do something like this:
	set_waitqueue_resize_start(zone);
	// now all of the waiters will spin
	zone->wait_table = kmalloc();
	smp_wmb(); // make sure all the cpus see the kmalloc
	zone->wait_table_bits = new_bits;
	set_waitqueue_resize_done(zone);
Putting a seqlock next to wait_table_bits might also do the trick.  I
need to think about it some more.  BTW, I think this only works for the
waiter side, not the wakers.  But, I think it can work in both cases.

Why do you need those retries to shrink the size?  Are you actually
getting common failures?  Is it best to shrink the size, or try
something like vmalloc?  This seems a bit hackish to me.
