Yet another thing (1) on end_buffer_io_async() to handle a case which is
only true for a specific user of it. Since the other special case handling
is for swap IO too, I think a separate IO end operation for swap would be
interesting.
(1) The current one is SetPageDecrAfter handling.

Yes. If the buffer_head is uptodated (BH_Uptodate) then its a WRITE,
otherwise its a READ (this is only true before mark_buffer_uptodate() call
inside end_buffer_io_async(), of course).
