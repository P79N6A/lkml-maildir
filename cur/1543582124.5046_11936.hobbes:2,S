Hey all.  The modversions code has a slight problem with files of the same
name, but in different directories.  eg: drivers/a/foo.c exports FOO, and
drivers/b/foo.c exports BAR, include/linux/modules/foo.ver will only have the
information about drivers/b/foo.c.  Anyone got an idea on how to fix this?
