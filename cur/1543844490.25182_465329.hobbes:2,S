assuming that it knows where to get the patches from, I was refering to things

in most cases, but there are cases where the dumb transports can make mistakes 
(there have been several threads on the git list covering these), git is good 
enough to notice mos of them, but there is still room for problems. Also, 
installing and configuring git should not be a prerequesite to getting the 
kernel.
the point being git and ketchup do not eliminate the need to transfer tarballs, 
and therfor do not eliminate the attractivness of a compression that saves a 
significant amount of bandwidth.
I was responding to the (apparent) argument that with git and ketchup people 
should not ever be downloading tarballs, so something that cuts the size of a 
tarball in half doesn't make any difference.
