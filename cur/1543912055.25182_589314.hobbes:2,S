The grammatic rules involving __extension__ are these (the lhs stems from 
the standard directly):
   external-declaration:
     __extension__ external-declaration
   struct-declaration:
     __extension__ struct-declaration
   nested-declaration:
     __extension__ nested-declaration
   unary-operator: one of
     __extension__ __real__ __imag__
The first three allow to put __extension__ in front of any external or 
local declaration (including decls inside blocks, in C99), ala:
  {
    x = 1+3;
    __extension__ int y = 3;
    x += y;
  }
the last one defines __extension__ as an unary operator, which can be 
applied to all cast-expressions (which in turn are just unary 
expressions).  E.g.:
   x = 1 + __extension__ (2+3);
Note that the decls include the C99 nested-decls in for statements:
   for (__extension__ long long i = 0; ...)
Note further that there's a small ambiguity in parsing when just looking 
forward one token, namely between decl and expression, like in this 
example:
   { __extension__ int i;
vs.
   { __extension__ i + 2;
Here you can't decide if __extension__ introduces an expression or a decl.  
Probably doesn't matter for your parser.  Hope this helps.
Ciao,
Michael.
