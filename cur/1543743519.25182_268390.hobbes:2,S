First off, for some people that is literally where _most_ of the CPU 
cycles go.
Second, it's not just that the compilers are slower. Historically, new gcc 
versions are:
 - slower
 - generate worse code
 - buggier
For a _long_ time, the only reason to upgrade gcc was literally C++
support: basic C support was getting _worse_ with new compilers in pretty
much every regard.
Things seem to have improved a bit lately. The gcc-3.x series was 
basically not worth it for plain C until 3.3 or so.
