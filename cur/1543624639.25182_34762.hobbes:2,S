Subject: [PATCH] ALSA and IrDA workaround for Dell Inspiron

Here is a patch to solve an IrDA lockup when ALSA OSS is used with IrDA on 
Dell Inspiron 8100. Maybe some other laptops are concerned, too. Please test 
if other machines can use this patch.
The ALSA OSS initialization code performs a hard reset on the IrDA port of a 
Dell Inspiron. No more data can be sent or received via the infrared port 
until a cold restart of the system (power down). The lockup will always 
happen when ALSA is started after IrDA which is normally the case. 
I found the ALSA OSS AC97 modem probe is the reason. This patch enables a 
workaround by a kernel option CONFIG_SOUND_NO_MODEM_PROBE which 
disables the modem probe if the option is enabled.
The patch will be included in my upcoming kernel patch set -jp8.
Please reply with CC since I am not subscribed to the Linux kernel mailing
