Well, that's exactly how "top" gets the EUID. The code:
p->euid = sb.st_uid;       /* need a way to get real uid */
p->egid = sb.st_gid;       /* need a way to get real gid */
I sure hope this patch didn't slip by me somehow. Big proc changes
ought to get review by the maintainers of procps, gtop, gdb, and
probably a good number of packages that don't come to mind right now.
I'm lucky I spotted this while reading over old lwn.net stories.

The stat() call is cheap.
The status file is kind of nasty:
open()
read()
close()
parse vague ill-defined ASCII text using evil speed hacks
The procps code uses stat() for selection by EUID in some
cases, and for everything whenever the status file is not
needed for some other reason. The "top" program is quite
good about not opening the status file. Lots of profiling
showed that there would be a noticable performance difference.
