I got it this morning. Unfortunately, although the stock 5.1.10 driver
in 2.2.5 works fine with my hardware, the 5.1.14 blows up during boot
with scsi timeouts and reset errors.  Then it panics and that's all
she wrote.
I have two host adapters:
	Adaptec AHA-294X Ultra2 SCSI host adapter
	        Ultra2-LVD/SE Wide Controller   
				      
        Adaptec AHA-294X Ultra SCSI host adapter
                Ultra Narrow Controller 
...and three scsi devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: IBM      Model: DRVS09V          Rev: 00F0
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
  Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: VIKING 2.3 NSE   Rev: 8808
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 04 Lun: 00
  Vendor: ARCHIVE  Model: Python 28388-XXX Rev: 5.45
  Type:   Sequential-Access                ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  
  
Back to 5.1.10 and all is fine.
