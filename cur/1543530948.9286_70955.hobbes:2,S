EINVAL is correct.  As long as the ioctl() namespace doesn't have conflicts
there won't be a problem (and the _IO* macros are designed to avoid 
conflicts as long as you don't use the identity character of an existing
set of drivers).

I'm not sure why you want to fix anything: what is the problem?  If you 
simply reject ioctls you don't understand when you get called in the fs-
specific ioctl method, what goes wron with the existing mechanisms?
