I tried to apply loop-highmem.patch, loop-highmem-fixes.patch, and 
loop-remove-blkdev-special-case.patch on a vanilla 2.6.0-test11, and it 
finally made the cryptoloop work on my machine - an Athlon XP, 1.5G RAM. 
Without the patch, cryptoloop+highmem didn't work at all - a fresh 
created ext2 was either impossible to mount, or it mounted corrupted, 
and cryptoloop overall seemed to act more like /dev/urandom.
