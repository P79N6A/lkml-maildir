You are referring to the way NFSv2 lacks any way to request space
allocation on the server without also flushing data to disk?  It was
my understanding that NFSv2 clients that did not accept the
performance hit and do all writes synchronously were considered
broken.  (since, for instance, POSIX write-visibility guarantees are
violated if writes are delayed on the client.)
In v3 or v4, the WRITE/COMMIT separation lets the implementor generate
prompt ENOSPC and EDQUOT errors without performance penalty.
Another thing to keep in mind is that an application is often in a
much better position to recover from an error, particularly a
disk-full error, if it's reported on write rather than on close.
That's just a quality-of-implementation question, though.

I wasn't talking about EBADF.  How does the application know the
kernel will ever succeed in closing the file?

That is not the text quoted upthread.  Looks like the manpage did get
fixed, although I think the current wording is still suboptimal.
