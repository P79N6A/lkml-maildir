I have to disagree.  I used to use a Digital Unix system, which had this
feature, to do software development.  The program I was working on was
large, and linking it required more memory than the 128M that was installed
on the computer.  All my makes ended with a 10 minute swap storm during
which the computer was virtually useless.
I discovered that if I limited the RSS of the link process so that it left
a few megs of memory free then I could read mail or look around the web
while the link was running.  This of course slowed down the link, but I
was supprised by how little it suffered.  It might have been 10% slower
and the tradeoff I got was to be able to use the machine while it was
working rather than sitting there looking at it.
Thanks,
Jim
