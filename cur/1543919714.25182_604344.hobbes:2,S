I have an objection against this approach:
Our __*init*/__*exit* annotations are already a constant source of bugs, 
and adding more pifalls (e.g. forgotten removal of _i()/_e() when a 
function is no longer __*init*/__*exit*) doesn't sound like a good plan.
Shouldn't it be possible to automatically determine where to put the 
strings? I don't know enough gcc/ld voodoo for being able to tell 
whether it is currently possible, and if yes how, but doing it 
automatically sounds like the only solution that wouldn't result in an
unmaintainable mess.
Ideally, even the current annotations might one day no longer be 
required and replaced with some way to express things like "everything 
only required by module_init() can be __init".
