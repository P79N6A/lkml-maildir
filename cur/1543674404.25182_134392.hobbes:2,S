The only issue that we might have, is that <linux/abi/*> will once
again break many things.  Sure, if we have to fix them once to get
this fixed for good, why not.
On the other hand, why not leave it at <linux/*.h> and <asm/*.h>
as the location of the ABI, and then move all kernel only
related stuff to <kernel/*.h> (or whatever, just the concept which
count ...) which can then include whatever it needs form the other
places (linux/asm)?
