Any limit would have to be very high - definitely more than just half.  What if the 
application needs to pin 2GB?  The customer is not going to buy 4+ GB of RAM just because 
Linux doesn't like pinning more than half.  In an x86-32 system, that would required PAE 
support and slow everything down.
Off the top of my head, I'd say Linux would need to allow all but 512MB to be pinned.  So 
you have 3GB of RAM, Linux should allow you to pin 2.5GB.
