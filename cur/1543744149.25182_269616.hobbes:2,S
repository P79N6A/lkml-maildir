This is the wrong way to do it. I've been trying this and discarded it.
The problem is that data arrival is asynchronous to the event which
means you've not got a clue how to combine the status change and the
data stream. This in itself makes the whole feature useless.
Modem changes have to go inline with the data just like break and
parity.

You also forgot to update the Documentation directory.
