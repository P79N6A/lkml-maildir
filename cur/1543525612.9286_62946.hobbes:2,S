Itsy is a research project, not a commercial product.  If you wanted to 
build a single hard drive prototype you couldn't do it for $100 either.
Where do you think those thousands of dollars go?  It isn't on the basic 
computer components.  The CPU in Itsy is a SA-1100 which probably costs 
about $50 in even one-off quantities.  It needs virtually no glue logic, 
just a stick of RAM, some boot ROM and you're away.
Now, if you're in the hard disk industry, chances are you plan on selling a 
million units or so.  So, you go to ARC or ARM or MIPS or SPARC (or...) and 
license a small CPU core that you can put into an ASIC.  Then you do the same 
for a gigabit ethernet controller, a DRAM interface, and whatever else you 
need.  Maybe you design some of these yourself.  Maybe you plan on putting all 
this onto the same die as some of your existing logic.  Whatever, you end up 
with a chip that you can churn out for a handful of dollars apiece and that 
contains the majority of the components you need to run Linux.

That 100MHz Pentium may cost you $50 today, but when you want to buy another 
ten next week (and you want them to be the same as the first one) things won't 
look so good.  In any case, space and power are big concerns for a lot of 
people.
