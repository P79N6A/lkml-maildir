Probably. But please note that the first item doesn't need an explicit check,
since as will just error out when not recognizing the .incbin keyword.
About the second item, I don't know whether there are binutils versions that
have the ld bug, but do implement .incbin in as. If these don't exist, no such
test is necessary.
So it's just the people (like me :-) who work around installing a new version
of binutils that got hit...
The reason I'm still using gcc 2.95.2 is that 3.2 gives ICEs on some source
files.
