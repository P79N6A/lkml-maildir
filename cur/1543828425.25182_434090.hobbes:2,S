thanks!

not yet. If it's a real problem we could introduce a 'make clock events 
more reliable' framework by doing something like always programming 
clock event sources into periodic mode and reading their current time 
offset [if possible] when the event is processesed (thus compensating 
for most of the drift caused by irq processing latency). But if it's not 
needed it would be nice to avoid that complexity. I'm also wondering why 
the PM timer was the most accurate in that regard - it's almost as slow 
to program as the PIT, so i'd have expected it to to show the biggest 
drift.
(another technique to reduce drift: we could increase the APIC-priority 
of the lapic timer, making it less suspect to drift when there are lots 
of other IRQs going on.)
can you think of any other similar 'weird cases' that you saw happen 
with dynticks? For example there's the 'APIC stops timer irqs when 
entering C3 mode' bug - any similar weirdness we should be careful 
about? [right now the patch doesnt handle the C3 mode bug, but it should 
be relatively straightforward to blacklist lapic events in that case]
i'm looking at dynticks-060227.patch right now, and there seem to be a 
fair amount of dyntick specific changes to ACPI's processor_idle.c code. 
Do you remember what those changes were about and should we pick them up 
in one way or another?

which function(s) were you looking at when coming to this conclusion? 
clockevents_init_next_event() perhaps? [we could certainly put 
'sources->nextevent' into a local variable there]

You mean ->event_handler()? We can make all clockevent instantiations 
__read_mostly right now - all of the fields of clock_event are static, 
even ->event_handler() will change at most once per bootup [when we 
switch from low-res into high-res mode].
