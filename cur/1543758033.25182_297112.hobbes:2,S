It takes 627 lines of code to count the number of tasks in a class?

All of the logic to borrow if you've gone over your limit should be a
quite repeated theme throughout all of the controllers.  Seems to me
that at least a larger chunk of that should be in generic code.

How often is this called?  Do you really need unlikely()?
