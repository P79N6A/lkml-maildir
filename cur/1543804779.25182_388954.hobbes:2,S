...and then you try to execute mozilla in place, and your dream slowly
turns into nightmare, as letters start to appear, pixel by pixel...
[swap is backing store for anonymous memory. Think about it. You need
swap as long as you support malloc. You could always provide filename
with malloc, but hey, that starts to look like IBM mainframe. Plus
ability to powercycle the machine and *have* it boot (not continue
where it left) is lifesaver.]
