Hello,   I believe this is the right forum for this question and if I am
incorrect I appologize.
While using bridging in the kernel along with the BRGCFG I did a cat
/proc/net/bridge.  It proceeded to display a list of MAC address's and
other info.  And then viola the system locks up.  Not just networking
but the console too.
Is this my fault for cat'ing a file that I should not have or is this a
bug?  I was using 2.2.10 with no patches plus most of the advanced
router code.
Thanks
Darrell Wright
