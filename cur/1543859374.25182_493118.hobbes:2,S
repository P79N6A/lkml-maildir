This piece isn't in -mm tree, but this piece is in 2.6.19.
Which version should I follow ?

We don't have a spinlock for add_netcon_dev, because we don't need
to get a spinlock for add_netcon_dev except for list operation.
So, it must be atomic.

The netpoll_lock is for each structure containing information related to netpoll
(remote IP address and port, local IP address and port and so on).
If we don't take a spinlock for each structure, the target IP address and port
number are subject to change on the way sending packets.
