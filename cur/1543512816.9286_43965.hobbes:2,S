All...
	Ok...  I know that the first thing that the Applixware people are
going to say is "you're running on a development kernel - don't do that".
Be that as it may, I thought people should know of some sort of weird
conflict that I'm running into between ApplixWare and the 2.3.21 kernel.
I have to, subsequently, drop back to 2.2.12 to do any work with ApplixWare.
The problem...
	Been running 2.3.21 for several days.  Needed to work on a
presentation (never fails - this stuff always happen when I've got
a presentation to cook).  Started up applixware.  Within a few minutes
I had run out of disk space in my /home partition.  Huh?  I had over
200 Meg free when I last looked.  Sure enough, df say 0 in /home.
I deleted some big mailbox back files and such, recovering 50-70 Meg.
Before I could blink, home is full again!  Now I'm annoyed.  A half
hour of investigation later, I've discovered that it's the file
.xsession-errors that has grown to almost 400 Meg!  So I shut down
everything and discover that it's the axnet background process that's
eating up CPU cycles and spitting out error messages like this:
] rpc_svr.c - accept failed, sockfd=3, errno 107
	Millions of them...
	I killed the process (which, unfortunately, does not exit when
you exit applixware) and copied /dev/null over .xsession-errors.  I
then started applixware again, but didn't start any of the apps, I just
brought up the application bar.  Started happening again.  Within minutes
the process had rang up piles of CPU time and the .xsession-errors file
was hugh.  The errors was was over a meg before the Applixware main window
even appeared.
] alcove:~$ grep rpc_svr.c .xsession-errors | wc
] 2651497 18560479 124620359
] alcove:~$ 
	Less than five minutes and it racked up over 18 Million lines like
that and grew .xsession-errors to over 124Meg.
	The error number is curious too.  From <asm/errno.h>:
] #define ENOTCONN        107     /* Transport endpoint is not connected */
	Rebooted to 2.2.12 and no problem.  Rebooted to 2.3.21 and it's
screwed again.  Don't know if its something bad in 2.3.21 or something
that Applixware is doing that they shouldn't and it's causing the failure.
So this is a jump ball to both sides of the court.
	The critter is really nasty, since you can totally shut down all
of your apps and even log out and he keeps ticking away at your error file.
	Definitely something that needs fixing by one side or the other
before 2.4 comes out!
	Mike
