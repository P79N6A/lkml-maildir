Looks like it is hardware related after all:

I found out that poor smb performance is related to a broken udp-perfomance of the 8169 NIC in outgoing udp.
But, only in Gb Mode of the 8169 NIC, with 100Mbps it is ok.

I have:
03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller (rev 01)
04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168B PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet controller (rev 01)
That must be the issue, time to buy an Intel PCI-e NIC if I want better 
performance with samba in Linux.
I do have another one of these motherboards (ABIT AW9D-MAX) running XP and 
it does not seem to suffer from this problem, I guess the [proprietary? 
Realtek driver does not suffer from this bug]?
