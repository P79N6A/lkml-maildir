RAIF supports rules that describe how to store particular files or groups
of files.  A rule with RAIF level 0 (which is similar to RAID level 0) and
a special striping unit size = '-1' will do the same (distribute the
files on the lower file systems) for files that match any given file name
pattern.  A rule with level 4 and striping unit size = '-1' will
distribute files on several file systems and store an extra copy of the
files on a dedicated file system (e.g., an NFS mount with lots of space).
Now guess what RAIF's level 6 will do with a special striping unit
size = '-1' :-)
