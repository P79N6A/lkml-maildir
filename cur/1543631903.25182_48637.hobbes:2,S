And some aren't...  my main thrust for pursuing this idea was to
present minimal latency to the application.  That is why I want to use
NVRAM for the journal.
My particular application is an NFS server which traditionally suffers
badly if there is too much latency.
Certainly there are situations where a small drop in latency can
improve throughput, but I want to maximise the throughout without any
cost in latency.  And I am willing to spend on the NVRAM to do it.
I'm seeing two very different approaches to journalling an MD device
being significant.
One journals to NVRAM and trys to minimise latency, and works for any
RAID level.  It is basically a write-behind cache.
The other journals to a normal drive and only works for RAID5 (which
is the only level that really needs a journal other than for latency
reasons) and writes to the journal after a the stripe parity
calculation and before the data+parity is sent to disc.
They will probably be very different implementations, though they will
hopefully have a very similar interface.
