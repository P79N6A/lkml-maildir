Hi
1, I have a question related page frame reclaim .
As i understood , under low memory pressure page frame reclaiming will
swap  Least Recently Used cache to disk .
So my question is assume no swap space ,how to works ?
Whether the  Least Recently Used  slab cache , inode cache  etc  will
be discard since no swap space .
2. BTW ,I have already used my gmail account subscribe the linux kernel mail list .but can not post the question to mail list , i used plain text format . 
why ? I have seen many people use account of gmail  to post question .
Thanks advanced .
Best Regards .
