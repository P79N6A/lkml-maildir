They should be pretty solid. The original VIA code worked pretty well,
the kernel merge had a few glitches but in 2.6.9* it seems rock solid
with the bits Francois applied.

I've seen this with an Edimax el cheapo gigabit switch, but it was also
doing it with some other cards so I assumed it was random cheap junk.
Since I swapped that for a slightly better one it's behaved reliably.

There is a vendor provided driver for older systems (and in fact VIA
networking wrote and contributed the code that was cleaned up to go into
the kernel too)
