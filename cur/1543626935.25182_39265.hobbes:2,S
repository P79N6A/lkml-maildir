How about this:
#include <sys/sysinfo.h>       
...
    //nproc = get_nprocs(); // Available processors
    nproc = get_nprocs_conf(); // Configured processors (some can be down...)
(glibc 2.2.5, but i think it keeps working since time ago).
BTW, why linux does not implement sysconf(_SC_NPROC_[CONF,ONLN]) ??
TIA
