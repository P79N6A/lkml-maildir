Hello,
I've found an unfortunate bug in the "linux/timex.h" file.  This file include "sys/time.h" and this cause any program that use the adjtimex syscall to be unable to compile (You get a lot of multiple definition error message). The only work-around, I've
made is to comment the "#include <sys/time.h>" line and add it  myself in my  (user-mode) program that use the adjtimex syscall.
I would like to know :
1) Is there any side-effect with this ?
2) Is it safe ?
Best regards
