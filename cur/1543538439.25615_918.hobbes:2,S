Hi Premela,
                    Here goes the answers
1. How to configure the SMP as I am using two Intel Pentium III Processors?
while installation itself you should have selected the smp kernel.  I think in server class
installation, the smp kernel gets selected by default.  if yes,  your /etc/lilo.conf will something
like this
          boot=/dev/hda
       map=/boot/map
       install=/boot/boot.b
       prompt
       timeout=50
       default=linux
      image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.12-20smp
               label=linux
              initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.12-20smp.img
              read-only
              root=/dev/hda2
      image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.12-20
              label=linux-up
              initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.12-20.img
              read-only
              root=/dev/hda2
If the first image is /boot/vmlinux-2.2.12-20smp then , you have already got the smp kernel by
default.
OR
There is one more method by which you find out this . Do a "uname -a " This will tell you, as to
which kernel your pc is currently working on.
2. Is there a way to resize the partitions while running/using the Linux OS?
No. I dont' know of any such option. But, definetely it is possible if you select this
resizing/growable of partition while installing the OS.  Please go thru the HOW -TO  / INSTALLATION
GUIDE. It is clearly given over there.
3.   Any tips on how best to do partitioning on this machine that has 18.2 GB hard Drive, 384MB RAM
Well, i don't know the need and exact objective of yours of installing such a pc. So i cna't truly
state anything clearly. But, it my opinion the following way of partitioning will be good
a)  /dev/hda1     +120M (swap partition)
b) /dev/hda2      +2.0 GB (Root partition)
c)  /dev/hda3      +3.0 GB (/usr partition -to install applications )
d) /dev/hda4        +16.0 GB  EXTENDED
e) /dev/hda5        +6.0 GB   ( /home partition - your home partition - to keep personal stuffs)
The remaining partitions you can split up into according to your need.
I hope  i have made myself clear.
Please get back to me  if you have any doubts
Regards
