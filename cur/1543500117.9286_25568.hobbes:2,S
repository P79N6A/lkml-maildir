Yes I see your point.
Right now I am using a put_page_refcount to decrease the page count
without calling free_pages by hand when I know I have some additional
refcount that can't trigger the page to be released for real, this way for
example I issue a put_page_refcount(2, page) in truncate_inode_pages
instead of a __free_page in try_to_free_buffers and two __free_pages in
truncate_inode_pages. Since I can't run free_pages I don't run freepages
anymore in try_to_free_buffers and I left the caller to discover if it has
to free the page for real or not (freepages only remove the buffer heads
from the page, start I/O and tell to the caller what it did). The caller
then will unlock the page before freeing the page for real, or it will go
ahead in the inode path only issuing a put_page_refcount(1, page). (so far
it compiles :)
