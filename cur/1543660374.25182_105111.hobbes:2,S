OK that explains the data with my own computer. But there is another case
when a Linux NFS client mounts an AIX NFS file system:
(preferred_blksize.perl shows s_blksize of stat() and is used due to the
non-existent stat command on this machine)
root@w0008077 / # mount -o hard,intr,nfsvers=3,udp,rsize=8192,wsize=8192
ibm03:/net/ibm03/fs7/share/netinst_aix /mnt
root@w0008077 / # ~xrsc062/preferred_blksize.perl /mnt/nmon7.tar 
file /mnt/nmon7.tar has the preferred blksize 512.
root@w0008077 / # umount /mnt
root@ibm03 / # ~xrsc062/preferred_blksize.perl /net/ibm03/fs7/share/netinst_aix/nmon7.tar 
file /net/ibm03/fs7/share/netinst_aix/nmon7.tar has the preferred blksize 
4096.
As you can see, the actual server-side s_blksize is 4k, whereas the Linux
client takes it to be 512 bytes. An strace output confirms that a "cat" of
a file actually uses 512 byte IO chunks.
In each case the kernel used is a 2.4.20 with your NFS client patches (and
some of Neil's server patches).
If a RedHat or SuSE kernel is used (which probably does not include 
O_DIRECT, but I am not sure) then there seems to be the correct behaviour,
and the s_blksize is the same as the rsize/wsize options demand, e.g. 8k
or 32k.
Many thanks in advance for your help and best regards.
