I am, for the USB and PCI hotplug stuff:

It makes tracking what patches got applied, and which didn't, and
forward porting those that didn't to the next release, a breeze.
My trees are world readable, and people are welcome to send me patches
against it, or even bitkeeper changesets, but I have yet to receive one
of those yet :)
thanks,
