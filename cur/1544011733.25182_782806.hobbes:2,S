What is the future of the bits beyond bit 15 in st_mode?  Currently
only 16 bits are used.  There are old struct stat formats which have
only 16 bit st_mode fields.  Is this the limiting factor?
I ask because I want to use one bit in glibc.  If the future of the
kernel calls for more than 16 bits in st_mode, can we agree on a bit
(perhaps bit 31) to be reserved for userlevel?
