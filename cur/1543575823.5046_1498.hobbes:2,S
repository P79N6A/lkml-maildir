I see and I assume calling a random collection of data
	u.something
in BSD was even more logical  8)
current is a completely rational name. The problem with current on some of
our ports right now is that its a #define. That is a trap for the unwary and
one day wants fixing.
curproc would be incorrect for linux since its the current task, and a task and
unix process are not the same thing
