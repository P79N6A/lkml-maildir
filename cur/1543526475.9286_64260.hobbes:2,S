I think it is impossible. In Linux Root==God (someone must have the
ultimate power as anyone can fail and someone must be there to fix
things up). Anything a given user can do, root can do it, too.
Maybe there is an application that can prohibit root's access to your
data while you are working with it (like pgp), but then: Root can still
listen to /dev/tty*, no?
