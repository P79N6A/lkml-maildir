The patch was posted multiple times on linux-arch and it has been part
of -mm for 3 months. Plenty of time for the arch maintainers to notice.
And without the pte_pfn_t change it would compile on a nommu
architecture even without the typedef. That is why I didn't add the new
typedef to the nommu archs. Which turned out to be a mistake after the
pte_pfn_t change has been added but the problem is fixed with the patch
sent yesterday, isn't?
