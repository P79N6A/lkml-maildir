Look at the comment on my patch. I've suggested that :)
I've added a __GFP_FAIL flag back in 2.4-ac something days exactly for
that purpose. I've ported the same code to the XFS tree so they could try
to "lazily" allocate (big) structures to build page clusters.
However, there is one nasty problem with it: How we can define "don't try
too hard" ?
Lets say you want to use the __GFP_FAIL flag when trying to allocate data
to do more readahead. If it fails too easily, we're never going to do
enough readahead.
What I'm trying to say is that we would need levels of "don't try too
hard" to have a nice scheme, and thats not simple.
See my point?

It could be used in a _LOT_ of performance critical parts of the kernel,
indeed.
