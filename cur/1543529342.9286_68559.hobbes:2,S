The socket 0 timed out thing should be fixed in 2.3.51.
It's due to the TI cardbus controllers not correctly sensing the power of
the inserted card, so the higher level layers will try to apply 5V power
and it goes to hell from there. I added code in 2.3.51 to notice when the
power sense is wrong and force a new VS sense event.
The rest of the problems are probably not related, but I'd like to know
that 51 does indeed at least fix this one..
