Probably not polite
If someone takes your proprietary code and combines it with GPL code in
a way the GPL license prohibits then they not you are committing the
license violation (they are probably also violating your license as well
as the GPL license by doing so)
There are exceptions to that - one might be if you developed the code
and arranged for the person to do the merge with Linux rather than
someone else doing it. 
In the normal case of things I can combine two works only if the
licenses of the two works are compatible, that is effectively only if I
have permission from all parties who own rights on the resulting
"derivative" work.
