I had the same experience even with a little lower requirements wrt.
CPU performance - music player daemon (mpd) tends to eat a lot more
cycles when it is configured to use alsa style devices, but is pretty
low-impact when it talks to the OSS emulation provided by the very same
alsa drivers.
With wine and starcraft on my not-so-recent yet well maintained laptop
the difference in results was ultimate.
By the way, I still have to apply some scheduler tricks, makes me wonder
about wine's development during the past few years. I used to play
starcraft through wine on an ancient Pentium, and now a Mobile Pentium
III is almost choking on it. I wonder what is going on...
Kind regards,
Chris
