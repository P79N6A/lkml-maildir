Those functions that need alteration aren't "switched" between
different arches like that. The patch just hardcodes arch specific
crud into general code, and would never be submittable. There was 
some clean way to fix it suggested, but I forget what it was at 
the moment ... will work it out again with Greg.

Does it really matter who's registers we're reading when using
pointers we know are corrupted garbage? Far better to fix the
pointers than fuss around working what they ended up pointing
at this spin of the bottle ...
IIRC, it's getting mislead by the PCI-PCI bridge itself, which is
always returning the local bus number of 3 no matter which quad 
it's on. It's not the read operations themselves that are borked
(this time), it's the data that the bridge is returning is being
"misinterpreted".
