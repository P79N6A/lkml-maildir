Hello!
  There is still patch to string-486.h at 
http://www.dce.bg/~petkan/
waiting for inclusion in 2.4 kernel.
  This patch was written by Petko Manolov (petkan@dce.bg) and can be found
at 
http://www.dce.bg/~petkan/linux/string-486.diff
  Intro to patch says:
  Patch to .../linux-2.4.0-test7/include/asm-i386/string-486.h. memset and
memcpy routines was completely rewritten in order to get higher
performance. The aim is to go in final 2.4 kernels so please test.
