Very useful ability, that.  Especially when the vendor tool reports
the wrong license number so the license you legally obtained doesn't
work.  Changing the software MAC address makes everything better.  The
one time I had to do this, it was fun to tell people "In order to do
my job today I had to break Federal law."  Alas I think everyone
assumed I was just being melodramatic.
