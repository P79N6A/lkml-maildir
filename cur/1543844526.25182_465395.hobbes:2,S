Hi all,
I renewed and resend this patch.
This is the blackfin architecture for 2.6.18, again. As we promised,
we fixed some issues in our old patches as following.
- use serial core in that driver
- Fix up that ioctl so it a) doesn't sleep in spinlock and b) compiles
- Use generic IRQ framework
- Review all the volatiles, consolidate them in some helper-in-header-file.
 And we also fixed a lot of other issues and ported it to 2.6.18 now.
As usual, this architecture patch is too big so I just give a link
here. Please review it and give you comments, we really appreciate.
This is a big patch so I only put a link here:
