Yes and no. I was kidding about "scheduler improvements" part.
(they're mostly NUMA-only)
But of course memload, read and write latencies aren't necessarily caused by 
scheduler itself. 
(burn also reads a file)
The easiest thing to do would be to add staircase to -mm and see what happens.
It shouldn't be hard to port. (in fact, it may apply cleanly)
