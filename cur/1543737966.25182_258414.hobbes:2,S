OK, here they are, plus a third one that also seems neccessary:
This one's by Martin Schaffner:
http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/crosstool-0.28-rc37/patches/linux-2.6.8/linux-2.6.8-build_on_case_insensitive_fs.patch
This one's by Kevin Hilman.  I haven't tried it yet, but seems neccessary:
http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/linux-2.6.8-netfilter-case-insensitive.patch
Both of the above choose arbitrary ways to avoid using
filenames identical but for case.  Feel free to pick
some other way, there's nothing magic about the names we picked.
This one's after an idea by bertrand.marquis@sysgo.com,
but it's small enough to be considered trivial.  Many OS's
don't support shared libraries as easily as Linux does,
and there's nothing to be gained by making libkconfig shared, so don't.

Anything you can do to help get these patches
reviewed and possibly applied would be quite welcome.
