ok.

good point.

Yup, you're right.

well, block > size is likely to arrive from a corrupt i_size, and the
insistence upon going ahead and checking the next page after
encountering an error on the last one... I don't have any scenario in
mind where we'd be repeatedly trying to check blocks < 0.

As do all other printk's in minixfs... (hm and 11,619 other printk's in
the kernel :) )

Fair enough, as you said I was just fixing up the issue, not rewriting
the code around it.  But yes, I should probably have considered at least
a better message here.  I can fix this up & resend.  But I'm not
promising to audit all other printk's in minixfs this time around.  ;-)
