Could you please elaborate a little bit more on this? I don't see how 
detecting loops in graph relates to solving halting problem.
Of course the halting problem can be transformed to deadlock-detection 
problem, but this relates to static code analysis, right? Not anything we 
are interested in, i.e. tracking things in runtime and detecting loops in 
simple dependency graphs.
