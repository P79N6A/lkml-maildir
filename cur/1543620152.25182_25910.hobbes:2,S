   Architecture maintainers are not supposed to decide whether driver
   writers understand APIs.  The dma64_addr_t type is part of the PCI
   DMA interface and IA64 needs to defines it.
You do have a point, but so does David.
What driver wants to get at this type and what are they using it
for?  dma_addr_t should be used by every driver I am aware of
except the clustering PCI cards I've been told about and that
driver isn't in the kernel at this time.
So who needs it? :-)
