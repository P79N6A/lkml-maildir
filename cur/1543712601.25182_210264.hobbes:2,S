Understood.  Incidentally, the glibc-kernheaders package included with 
RH 7.3 creates those files as symlinks, I'm sure however that they were 
there for the compilation of glibc.  The disconnect that I forsee, is 
that I will be running the 2.2.26 with kernel headers from a 2.4.x 
kernel - would this be the correct thing to do?
I suppose I mirror the sentiments of DervishD on this from his post.
