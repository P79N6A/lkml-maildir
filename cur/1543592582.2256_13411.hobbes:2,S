Hi,
Has anyone noticed their Linux box lock up hard (as in cannot even be
pinged from the local network) when switching from a text vc to a vc
running X? This has happened for me even without the mga.o and
agpgart.o modules being loaded. My current workaround has been to swap
out the Matrox-supplied mga_drv.o and mga_hal_drv.o modules and
replace them with the ones from the standard X 4.03 distribution, but
these are userspace objects and shouldn't be capable of bringing the
kernel down. (Like I said, the machine can't even be pinged.)
My best guess is that the mga_hal_drv.o object is ticking an obscure
kernel bug. I am raising this with the Matrox support line as well.
Cheers,
Chris
