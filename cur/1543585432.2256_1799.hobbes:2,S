Well yes this is a problem, but only when starting out with a low effective
CPU freq and going high - the reverse is usually OK because longer than
anticipated waits are OK.
However, you can alleviate this problem by not using udelay (or mdelay) but
using a kernel timer. I would think you should be doing this anyway (700ms
is a LONG TIME) but this should also work regardless of effective CPU freq.
A grep of the kernel source shows cs46xx isn't even doing the biggest
mdelay. I can understand the use of spinning on a calibrated loop for less
than a clock tick, but I gotta think there are better ways for longer
periods.
I wonder if there is a way to modify mdelay to use a kernel timer if
interval > 10msec? I am not familiar with this section of the kernel, but I
do know that Microsoft's similar function KeStallExecutionProcessor is not
recommended for more than 50 *micro*seconds.
