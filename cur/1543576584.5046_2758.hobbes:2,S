mm...  I think we should kill the USE_RW_WAIT_QUEUE_SPINLOCK option.

I don't understand the problem with 2) in 2.2?  Every task on both waitqueues
gets woken up.  Won't it sort itself out OK?
For 2.4, 2) is an issue because we can have tasks on two waitqueues at the
same time, with a mix of exclusive and non.  Putting a global spinlock
into __wake_up_common would fix it, but was described as "horrid" by
you-know-who :)

I really like this approach.  It fixes another problem in 2.4:
Example:
static struct request *__get_request_wait(request_queue_t *q, int rw)
{
        register struct request *rq;
        DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, current);
        add_wait_queue_exclusive(&q->wait_for_request, &wait);
        for (;;) {
                __set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	/* WINDOW HERE */
                spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
                rq = get_request(q, rw);
                spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
                if (rq)
                        break;
                generic_unplug_device(q);
                schedule();
        }
        remove_wait_queue(&q->wait_for_request, &wait);
        current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
        return rq;
}
If this task enters the schedule() and is then woken, and another
wakeup is sent to the waitqueue while this task is executing in
the marked window, __wake_up_common() will try to wake this
task a second time and will then stop looking for tasks to wake.
The outcome: two wakeups sent to the queue, but only one task woken.
I haven't thought about it super-hard, but I think that if
__wake_up_common's exclusive-mode handling were changed
as you describe, so that it keeps on scanning the queue until it has
*definitely* moved a task onto the runqueue then this
problem goes away.

OK by me, as long as people don't uncautiously start using the
capability for other things.

ack.
I'll take another look at the 2.4 patch and ask you to review that
when I've finished with the netdevice wetworks, if that's
OK.
