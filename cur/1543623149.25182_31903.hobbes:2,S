Hmm.
My general contention is that the system should, by default, behave as
non-experts would expect, but this might be a point where we can't
agree.
It is, unfortunately, the cardinal rule when designing any usable
interfaces.  I reference Donald Norman's "The Design of Everyday
Things".  But I digress.

I'll give up on this one relatively easily (though it was a switch,
so this is relevant)...  but a more pertinent example would be
if you have IP aliasing going on with 2 cards on the same network
for failover capability, and they might be asymmetric.  Again,
the expectation is that the "primary" one would be what is mainly
used.

The firewall rules aren't as fine-grained as you're implying.  They
only accept packets or not, with the assumption that all programs
on the box are equally untrusted.
A good example is, you want a trivial high-security firewall, but
you want it to be a DNS and email server, knowing you only have
to be really careful about those 2 programs.
If the TCP/IP stack filters itself by what you've assigned it, then
you have the flexibility of using things like tcp wrappers (for
example) to allow one program but not another to accept things
from particular ports as well.   Though tcp wrappers have their
own host of problems.

OK.
