No, I was saying that this approach doesn't solve all problems that
exist with kexec and kexec-on-panic is a very important coming
functionality. If there is going to be prepatory work for its coming we
might as well at least try to consider all the problems that are at
hand.
Otherwise the same problems will just appear again when kexec-on-panic
starts to get used in the real world.
