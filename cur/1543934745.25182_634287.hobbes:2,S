folding often results in commit messages and hence credit lost - and 
thus discourages test/review feedback and bugfixing. It's also easier to 
see the track record/history of a patch if the fixes are in separate 
patches. It's also easier to undo a 'fix' (and track the state/version 
of changes) if it turns out to be a bad fix. If things get spaghetti 
then a new splitup indeed helps (for larger patchsets), and Andrew 
usually asks for a new splitup in that case. Andrew often folds patches 
together right before sending it off to Linus (while constructing 
combined credit - so credit is not lost).
