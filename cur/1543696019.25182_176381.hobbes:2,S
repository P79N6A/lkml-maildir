It's been a while since you used a real sysv right ? Or you've
used different ones then I did.
The correct command for single user mode is:
# shutdown now (equivalent to "init 1")
Now the system will throw you into single user mode. Here, all
processed are killed. It's just that all filesystems remain
mounted
You can now login and enter 'init 2' or 'init 3' or whatever to
go to that runlevel
Just exiting the shell (logout) will boot into the default runlevel
You can even just not login at all, press ^D and the system will
boot to the default runlevel.
The command that is run at single user mode is "sulogin". It's
invoked by init, as defined in /etc/inittab. If you just add
a timeout to the sulogin invocation (-t 20 or so) then sulogin
will exit after that timeout.
Now that is exactly what you want - add the timeout. Throw the
system into single user mode with "shutdown now" or "init 1".
After a while the system will be restarted from scratch
without a reboot.
This will work on Debian. It most likely will works on other
distributions too, and probably on most System Vs as well.
Though on System V the shutdown command is "shutdown -i1 -y".
Which, btw, will work just fine on Linux too ;)
