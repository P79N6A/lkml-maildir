Oh Jeff,
All these really good people, unable to capture a simple idea.
Let me try one more time.
There is information. The information is:
	"this variable needs initialization"
Now you tell me to know simple rules. OK, I know them.
But what do they tell me about my variables a and b, where
a requires initialization and b does not require it?
One can write a comment, like
int a;	/* this variable needs initialization, fortunately
	   it is already initialized at startup */
int b;	/* no initialization required */
But that is overdoing it, it uglifies the code.
One can leave the comment out, like
int a, b;
But then next month, when you decide to move this into
some function
int foo() {
	int a, b;
...
there is no indication that you need an additional
	a = 0;
You see?
There is real information here. Useful as a reminder.
Not necessary. The perfect programmer would see
immediately that the assignment is required, also
without the reminder. But not everybody is perfect
all of the time, and sometimes the code involved is
quite complicated. The tiny convention
"write an explicit initialization when initialization is needed"
is helpful. It is a form of program documentation.
