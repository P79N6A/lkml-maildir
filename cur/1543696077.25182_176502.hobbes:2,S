Ok, so NPTL locking (even in the absense of any threads and thus any 
contention) seems to be noticeably higher-overhead than the old 
LinuxThreads. 
90% of the overhead of a putc()/getc() implementation these days is likely
just locking. Even so, this implies that NPTL locking is about twice as 
expensive as the old LinuxThreads one.
Don't ask me why. But I'm cc'ing Uli, who can probably tell us. Maybe the 
RH-9 libraries are just not very good, and LinuxThreads has had a lot 
longer to optimize their lock behaviour..
