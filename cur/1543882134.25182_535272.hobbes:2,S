I can't understand why do we need to re-bind this thread. We are doing
kthread_stop()->wake_up() below, at this point move_task_off_dead_cpu()
has already cared about this task, no?

We need to ensure that this task can't be woken after return from
wait_task_inactive(k), otherwise set_task_cpu() after that is not safe.
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE doesn't protect us from freezing.
Couldn't we just remove this kthread_bind() ?
