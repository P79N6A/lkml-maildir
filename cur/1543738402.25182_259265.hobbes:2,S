I did not mean to say that VP approach alone can do hard realtime, that
was just an example.  But, when combined the MontaVista approach of
turning all but ~20 spinlocks into mutexes, it seems like the amount of
non-preemptible code is small enough that you could analyze it all and
start to make hard RT guarantees.
