from my personal PoV the following would be fine:
 spaces (for the various 'spaces')
  - similar enough to the old namespace
  - can be easily used with prefix/postfix
    like in pid_space, mnt_space, uts_space etc
  - AFAIK, it is not used yet for anything else
 container (for resource accounting/limits)
  - has the 'containment' principle built in :)
  - is used in similar ways in other solutions
  - sounds similar to context (easy to associate)
note: I'm also fine with other names, as long as
we find some useable vocabulary soon, as the
different terms start confusing me on a regular
basis, and we do not go for already used names,
which would clash with Linux-VServer or OpenVZ
terminology (which would confuse the hell out of
the end-users :)
best,
