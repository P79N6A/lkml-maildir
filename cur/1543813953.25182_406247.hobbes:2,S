Actually Mike R. and James S. deserve the credit for the composite
patch which consists of:
1) [PATCH] FC transport : Avoid device offline cases by stalling aborts until device unblocked
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-scsi&m=114225658724378&w=2
2) Serialize scan work during fc_remote_port_delete() so rport removal
doesn't deadlock midlayer scans.  The problem you were seeing.  (Mike
R.)
3) rport race fixes during removal (James S.).

Essentially there's currently several issues with rport consumers
making delete() calls during mid-layer scanning.
I'm hoping at a minimum we can get Mike R's fixes into 2.6.16, and
address the additional races going forward...  James/Mike?
Here's a minimal the serialize scan-work patch, could you check to see
that this addresses your issue?  Start with any latest linux-2.6.git
tree.
Thanks,
Andrew
