This is rather hard to believe so I think some more information is in 
order.  Specifically, how do you know that it is the windows kernel that 
is issuing these writes and not the application?  Under what application 
access patterns does it do this?
This is just rather hard to believe seeing as how, iirc, the CIFS 
protocol has commands to extend the file size properly rather than with 
this hack, and unless it is asked to by the application, the cifs client 
should not be trying to extend files.
