we didnt support it for quite some time. If you look at that ugly version 
check you replaced:
 #if __GNUC__ >= 4 && !gcc41_inlining_bug
 # include <linux/compiler-gcc4.h>
 #elif __GNUC__ == 3 && __GNUC_MINOR__ >= 2
 # include <linux/compiler-gcc3.h>
 #else
 # error Sorry, your compiler is too old, too buggy or not recognized.
 #endif
it has a hidden 'gcc 3.0 / 3.1 is not supported' condition in it. So what 
i tried to point out that your patch causes a regression here - we dont 
filter out gcc 3.0/3.1 out anymore.
