I actually see EVMS as the "VFS for disk devices".  It is a very good
way to at allow dynamic disk device allocation, and could relatively
easily be modified to use all of the "legacy" disk major devices and
export only real partitions (one per minor).
You could have thousands of disks and partitions without the current
limitations on major/minor device mapping.
This was one of the things that Linus was pushing for when 2.5 started.
Cheers, Andreas
