Hello,
Some change between -rc1-mm2 and -rc2-mm1 broke Kubuntu's udev
(079-0ubuntu34). In particular /dev/mem went missing, and /dev/null had
bogus permissions (crw-------). I've kludged around the problem by
populating /lib/udev/devices from a good /dev, but I'm assuming the
breakage was unintentional.
