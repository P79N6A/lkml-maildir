yes, and to improve debuggability, i often do this at the top of 
debugged .c modules:
	#undef inline
	#define inline
to get good stacktraces. So debuggability is i think another argument to 
further decouple 'inline' from 'always inline' - so a global .config 
DEBUG_ option could turn all inlines into real function calls. (we 
already have CONFIG_FRAME_POINTERS to improve stack-trace output, at the 
price of slightly slower code.)
