  Out of curiosity.  Is there any chart or list that would show the
current state of 2.4 compared to 2.5?  Not the stability or # of bugs,
but feature changes, security changes, etc?  Things I can show
management types of what is coming up?
  A first glance at the 2.5 about had me drooling and I'd like to get
management thinking that 2.6 is going to be a beautiful thing, not just
a service patch.
