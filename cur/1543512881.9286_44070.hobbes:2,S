I have a PII400 UP machine with a single 128M DIMM.  My kernel is only
recognizing 64M of that 128M.  I had this problem last year when it was a
known problem, but it worked fine once that 64M RAM bug was supposedly
fixed.  However, in 2.2.12 and 2.2.13pre15 I've noticed that it's gone
back to using only 64M of RAM.  The append="mem=128M" line in lilo.conf
will fix it, but I think this is a bigger problem that needs to be
addressed.
If you need more setup about my setup, just let me know.
