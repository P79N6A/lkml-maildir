Hmmh, there's a couple of things I don't understand, though they're most 
likely there for a reason. First of all, why do you need -fpic at all? 
kernel modules are not shared, they should get properly relocated when 
insmod'ing them, so I don't see why you're doing that.
The next thing I do not understand is why -fpic has the effect of marking
the section writeable, does it make .text writeable as well? And what for?

Well, it's not too bad, and it's hidden away in a header, so it's fine 
with me. Still, I don't understand yet why all this happens in the first 
place.
