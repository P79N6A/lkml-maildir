I think concentrating on the small gotchas for now is a good thing. 
Surely not all conceptual problems are fixable easily, they probably need 
to be done in conjunction with switching to a common parser etc. (Note: 
this switch to a new parser should happen with no change to the config.in 
format or semantics, in order to fit the Linux/Linus way of doing things). 
However, I think it is too late in 2.5 for these kind of big changes.
That doesn't mean that fixing bugs, of which there are plenty, and small 
improvements like "" == "n" where possible shouldn't be done. If nothing 
else, it will at least give a better starting point for more elaborate 
work later.
