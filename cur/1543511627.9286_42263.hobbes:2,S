Tradition!  Big 'ol arrays and clutter are obviously better than a
dynamic solution.  Hot-plugable devices are a myth made up by people
who don't realize that all hardware can be detected when you compile
your kernel the way it should be. Config files are for people too dumb
to recompile things when configurations change.  That's sarcasm, btw.
