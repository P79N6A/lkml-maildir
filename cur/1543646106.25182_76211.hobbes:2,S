We plan to.

To allow unique identification of plugins. If you wrote
plugin, you might give it an ID of 1. Someone else
may do the same thing. However, by letting you add
something specific which identifies you (i.e. like
your initials), then possibility of collisions is
reduced.

The common services are a set of functions exported
by the core code. We have major,minor,patchlevel
versions for them. Plugin writers specify the
version of the interface they are coded to comply
with. Mismatching core services and plugin
version expectations are caught at plugin registration
(load) time, and prevented from being usable.

the IOCTL entry point is used to send to volumes.
the DIRECT_IOCTL entry point is used for point-
to-point ioctls between corresponding user space
and kernel space plugins.

No the wrappers aren't really needed. However they do make the
code a great deal more readable.

The same argument could be made about *all* macros then.
Its simply a tradeoff between readability and potential
hiding.

Its a reminent of 2.4 stuff before mempool was available.
Its gone.

I've got no problem with doing that.

Sure, its easy to do. Having nested includes allowed us
to enforce include ordering.
