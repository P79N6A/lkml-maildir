Usually, if one driver detects the supported hardware, it'll grab the 
resources and would control the hardware afterwards, so If your hardware 
is supported by normal kernel sound drivers, ALSA will refuse to load 
because IRQ and IO Addr of your sound hardware is registered to normal 
 kernel driver.
