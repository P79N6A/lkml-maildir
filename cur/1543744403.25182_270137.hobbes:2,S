Including when CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT is set? Does it see the prototype then? 
Looks like <asm/acpi.h> should be included, but I assume it gets included 
some other way?
Quite frankly, I think the whole thing is broken. #ifdef's inside code is 
_evil_, and "platform_rename_gsi()" doesn't make sense as a name. I'll 
apply your patch, but quite frankly, I think the ACPI layer is doing crap.
Len, can you please use a more descriptive name, and have it be always 
defined (make it an inline function that just becomes a no-op or 
something).
