eventhough the gcc docs say it's just a hint to help the compiler optimize
the branch it takes by default, I too have noticed that it more often does
bad than good. Code gets completely reordered and even sometimes partially
duplicated (especially when the branch is a return).
Last but not least, gcc 4 tends to emit stupid checks, to the point that I
have replaced unlikely(x) with (x) in my code when gcc >= 4 is detected. What
I observe is that the following code :
    if (unlikely(p == NULL)) ...
often gets coded like this :
    reg1 = (p == NULL)
    if (reg1 != 0) ...
... which clobbers reg1 for nothing and performs a double test.
But yes, I assumed that the author considered its use to be legitimate (I've
not looked at the code). Maybe you're right and it should be removed, but in
this case we would need a large audit of the abuses of unlikely()...
