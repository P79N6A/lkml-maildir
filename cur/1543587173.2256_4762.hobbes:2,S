Just for the record, Michael Barabanov did this in RTLinux from before
kd_mksound was a function pointer in 1995. Michael had an optimization
attempt using channel 1 for a while, but on very slow machines this 
was not sufficient and he went back to channel 2. Of course, the 
fundamental problem is that board designers keep putting an 1920s
part in machines built in 2001. 
Here's the comment from the RTLinux 0.5 patch -- all available on the archives
on rtlinux.com.
