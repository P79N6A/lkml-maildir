We're happy to announce release 1.10 of FUSD, the Linux Framework for
User-Space Devices.
If you have a Linux 2.4 kernel running devfs, FUSD is a combination of
Linux kernel module and userspace library that lets you write
userspace programs that can act as character device drivers for files
under /dev.  Your program reigsters the device with the kernel module;
then, it proxies system calls (e.g.,  open(), read()...) to your
program.  Your userspace program can respond to these system calls as
a kernel module would.  Strict error checking at the user/kernel
boundary prevents such userspace drivers from corrupting each other,
the kernel, or even the processes using the devices they manage.
v1.10 has a number of enhancements, including:
  -- Now safe for SMP and preemptible kernels
  -- Includes both C and Python bindings
  -- /dev/fusd/status device shows a summary of devices registered and
     in use
  -- Updated documentation and various other bugfixes
Unfortunately, FUSD does NOT work under later 2.5 or any 2.6 kernels.
The recent changes to the devfs API break FUSD in a way that we
haven't yet looked into fixing.
Regards,
Jeremy
