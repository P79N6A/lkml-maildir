Yes, using read/write eliminates the compiler optimization
and makes the driver portable to other architectures.
That change is much more extensive, and it may be
a while before I can do a major rewrite of the driver.
The volatile change allows the existing driver to work.

This is not a matter of atomicity.
It is a matter of hardware DMA causing the
value to change without the compiler's knowledge.
If I have a DMA descriptor in normal memory (not the
case in the above driver, but it is the case in
another driver I maintain) that has fields that
do not conform to atomic_t, using volatile seems
a valid way of preventing the compiler from
optimizing access to the field out of a loop.
