You have _always_ had access to Linux.  You have had the entire
OS along with full source code to it for the last 10 years....
So 6 months of binary only access beats 10 years of full source?

If you were able to release full specs for your DSL PCI Card
(including specs on DSPs and the microcode needed to drive them),
I would gladly buy one tomorrow, even without a driver, because I
would know that even if nobody else cared about that card under
Linux, I could read the specs myself and fix the driver, or I
could pay somebody to fix the driver for me.  Without that
information, the card dies when Dlink loses interest...
