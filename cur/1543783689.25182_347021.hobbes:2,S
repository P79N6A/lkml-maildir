These are all fine. Although I am a bit suspicious of 150 second
timeouts; but if that is the hardware...

This needs to be msecs_to_jiffies(10), please.

Um, 100/100 = 1, not 0?

Which is technically ok, because HZ=100, a
     jiffies + 0
or
     jiffies + 1
timeout request will both result in the soft-timer being expired at
the *next* timer interrupt. Regardless, you're right, and
msecs_to_jiffies() will cover it.

Of bigger concern to me is the use of the sleep_on() family of
functions, all of which are deprecated.
