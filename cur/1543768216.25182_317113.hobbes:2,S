Why not this or something similar (e.g. I want to blacklist the xxx and 
yyy modules)? (note, untested)
in /etc/modprobe.d/hotplug_blacklist:
install xxx /sbin/blacklisted xxx
install yyy /sbin/blacklisted yyy
In /sbin/blacklisted:
#!/bin/sh
if [ -z "$SEQNUM" ] ; then
    /sbin/modprobe -i "$@"
else
    exit 1
fi
Any other variable that is certainly present in hotplug events will also 
work instead of $SEQNUM.
