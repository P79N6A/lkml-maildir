I think it's a step in the wrong direction. I'd like to be able to
compile all my kernels with support for all the debugging
functionality I _might_ find myself needing. I'd generally prefer to
use kgdboe, but if I have to fall back to using serial for some early
boot issue or network issue and have to recompile on top of that, I'll
be annoyed.
I'd rather see everything be run-time. Ideally, serial kgdb would be
smart enough to read command line args to know whether to grab ports
and so on and need essentially no compile time config.
