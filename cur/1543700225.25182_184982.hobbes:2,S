It is justified in the same way that the RTLinux entry was justified
for those many years. But the bottom line is as I said it before,
I personally have no take in this, and I certainly don't want to
start a debate on the use of the MAINTAINERS file, others are much
more apt than myself to make the proper judgement call on the proper
use of that file.
