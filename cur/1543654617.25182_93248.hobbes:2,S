Doesn't matter. The thing is, you have two kinds of fixups for things like 
VFS changes:
 - compiler warning/error based fixups (in which case it doesn't _matter_ 
   where it is, since in neither case will it get compiled for x86
 - a simple "grep xxxx *.c" kind of approach.
Yes, the latter often misses out on architecture files, because people
just won't even look at hits in sparc/ppc64/xxx, either being too timid to
want to check, or just not caring. But if the file is in kernel/xxxx, it 
will be noticed - at least as well as it would be if it was uglifying 
regular files with #ifdef's.

.. but it will have ugly #ifdef's inside the source file, something that I 
absolutely detest. 
Face it, the "compat" stuff is _secondary_. If it breaks, it breaks. It's
better to have the main code paths clean and unsullied, and take the risk
of occasionally breaking the compatibility stuff (that will break
occasionally anyway, see above).
Quite frankly, I want people to literally have the option to just ignore
the compat stuff, simply because it's not as important as the core kernel 
code. 
I see the compat32 patches as a convenience, and as a way to avoid 
duplicating bus over the system. I do NOT consider it to be core 
functionality, and I do _not_ think it should be a first-class citizen. 
Sorry, guys. Code cleanliness is _way_ more important to me.
