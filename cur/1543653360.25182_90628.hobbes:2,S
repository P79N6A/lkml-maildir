Rusty, you take that approach, and the module code flies out of the 
kernel. 
The block device code (and a lot of other code) has been there happily 
forever. And not breaking drivers was part of the module loader rule. Now 
you seem to say that drivers should be broken een if they are perfectly 
fine and do not have any races as is.
If so, then bye bye new module loader.
