Hi,
	I needed to replace my keyboard, and now I own a Chicony-8993
keyboard.  This one has my favotite standard layout + 14 extra keys
with multi-media key labels and two leds allong the right side.
Does anyone know how to ask this keyboard to start generating scan codes
for the extra 14 keys, and how to drive the two extra leds......?
Once this can be done, the rest of handling these keys is not a kernel
issue, more like something for X11 and gnome....
Thanks,
