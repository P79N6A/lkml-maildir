SIGURG is the urgent data indicator. It isnt reliable at the TCP protocol level
because multiple queued urgent data markers can be in flow together and there
is only one urgent data pointer.
Nobody appears to have filed a bug about it, so I would assume there isn't one.
Ask your Database vendor to actually report this if they have a bug and 
include some kind of small demo code example if possible.
