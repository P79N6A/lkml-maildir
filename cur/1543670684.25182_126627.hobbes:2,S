Applied.  Now I can log in by ssh and there are no problems with
pseudoterminals.  However, all local terminals are gone:
INIT: Id "1" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT: Id "2" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT: Id "3" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT: Id "5" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT: Id "4" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT: Id "6" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT: Id "S0" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes
INIT: no more processes left in this runlevel
The only entry under /dev/vc is /dev/vc/0.  /dev/tts is missing.
