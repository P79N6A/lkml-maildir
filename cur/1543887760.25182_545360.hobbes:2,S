Ah, okay.  Yes, clearly the new EFLAGS for the signal handler should 
have RF turned off.  This should always be true, regardless of 
debugging.

Hmmm.  I put in a little extra code to account for the possibility that
a program might want to set hardware breakpoints in itself.  Should
this be removed?

The fact that they are machine-specific and implementation-specific 
doesn't necessarily make them of no use.  See the driver below.

No; I have tested only a couple of systems and I don't have a wide
variety of machines available.

Allow me to rephrase: When a debug exception occurs, the real DR6 value
should be copied to vdr6, except that kprobes should adjust DR_STEP and
hw_breakpoint should adjust the DR_TRAPn bits appropriately.  There's
some question about what value the debug exception handler should write
back to DR6, if anything.  When switching to a new task, the DR_TRAPn
bits in vdr6 could be de-virtualized somehow and the result loaded into
DR6, but again, it might be safest to leave DR6 alone.
As for what users expect of the low four bits, you are definitely 
wrong.  My tests with gdb show that it relies on the CPU to clear those 
bits whenever a data breakpoint is hit; it doesn't clear them itself 
and it doesn't work properly if the kernel keeps virtualized versions 
of them set.  That's on a Pentium 4 and on an AMD Duron.
I did some testing to see how the CPU behaves when the debug handler
writes different values back to DR6.  The results were:
	Values written back to DR6 were retained in the register until 
	the next debug exception occurred.
	When the exception handler read DR6, the 0xffff0ff0 bits were
	set every time.  The 0x00001000 bit was never set, even if it
	had been turned on before the exception occurred.
	No matter what values were stored in the low four bits
	beforehand, when the exception occurred DR6 had only the
	bit for the debug register which was triggered.
	If the handler wrote back any of BS, BT, or BD to DR6, then
	the system misbehaved.  I don't know exactly what happened,
	but my shell process ended and the debug handler got called
	over and over again (as if stuck in a loop) for several
	seconds.
In light of these results, the best approach appears to be either to 
leave DR6 alone or to set it to 0.
Below is a patch containing a driver meant for testing kernel hardware 
breakpoints.  Instructions are in the comments at the top.  You can 
build the driver by typing "make M=bptest" at the top level.
The patch also adjust the Alt-SysRq-P handler to print out the debug 
register values along with all the other stuff.

+
+/*
+ * When this driver is loaded, it will create several attribute files
+ * under /sys/bus/platform/drivers/bptest:
+ *
+ *	 call, read, write, and bp0,..., bp3.
+ *
+ * It also allocates a 32-byte array (called "bytes") for testing data
+ * breakpoints, and it contains four do-nothing routines, r0(),..., r3(),
+ * for testing execution breakpoints.
+ *
+ * Writing to the "call" attribute causes the rN routines to be called;
+ * "echo >call N" will call rN(), where N is 0, 1, 2, or 3.  Similarly,
+ * "echo >call" will call all four routines.
+ *
+ * The byte array can be accessed through the "read" and "write"
+ * attributes.  "echo >read N" will read bytes[N], and "echo >write N V"
+ * will store V in bytes[N], where N is between 0 and 31.  There are
+ * no provision for multi-byte accesses; they shouldn't be needed for
+ * simple testing.
+ *
+ * The driver contains four hw_breakpoint structures, which can be
+ * accessed through the "bpN" attributes.  Reading the attribute file
+ * will yield the hw_breakpoint's current settings.  The settings can be
+ * altered by writing the attribute.  The format to use is:
+ *
+ *	echo >bpN priority type address [len]
+ *
+ * priority must be a number between 0 and 255.  type must be one of 'e'
+ * (execution), 'r' (read), 'w' (write), or 'b' (both read/write).
+ * address must be a number between 0 and 31; if type is 'e' then address
+ * must be between 0 and 3.  len must 1, 2, 4, or 8, but if type is 'e'
+ * then len is optional and ignored.
+ *
+ * Execution breakpoints are set on the rN routine and data breakpoints
+ * are set on bytes[N], where N is the address value.  You can unregister
+ * a breakpoint by doing "echo >bpN u", where 'u' is any non-digit.
+ *
+ * (Note: On i386 certain values are not implemented.  len cannot be set
+ * to 8 and type cannot be set to 'r'.)
+ *
+ * The driver prints lots of information to the system log as it runs.
+ * To best see things as they happen, use a VT console and set the
+ * logging level high (I use Alt-SysRq-9).
