I don't recall any spec mentioning that it doesn't work on large pages
so I thought it was safe to assume it had to work there too, I don't see
why it shouldn't, but it is certainly safe to go safe and double check.
IIRC the only bit to care about with the large pages is to flush with
the virtual address in the first half of the page to avoid falling into
an errata.
