I pointed this out.  Detecting the hardware all or most of the time isn't the
problem although sometimes detecting ram and clock settings seems deficient.

The dot clocks, scan frequencies, and to a lesser extent the video mode are what's
needed.  These are the parameters that really need to be tuned manually often with
XFree86 because you don't have the benefit of details of the particular card you
have.  These should be register settings in the video hardware which shouldn't
involve any OS details except how to get access to them when they are set properly.
