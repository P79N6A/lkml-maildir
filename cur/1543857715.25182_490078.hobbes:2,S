Yes, sorry :) now it boots and runs apparently fine.
I always had HPET_TIMER enabled until now. Ok, last time I tried was on
2.6.19-rt6.  Somehow I've failed to know or simply missed whether HPET
it's supposed to be off on PREEMPT_RT kernels. Maybe some simple
heads-up would be welcome :)
Notice that lately I have both HIGH_RES_TIMERS and NO_HZ enabled. Is
there any sense on having those options mutually exclusive with HPET_TIMER ?
Cheers.
