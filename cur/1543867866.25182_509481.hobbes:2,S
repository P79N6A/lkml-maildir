Most kernel developers did always say they don't agree with proprietary
drivers, don't want to support them and that they are convinced such
drivers are illegal. And according to the language of the GPL and the
copyright law, it's quite possible they really are illegal (although
a court _might_ rule that the modules are not a derived work of the
kernel). Even with all that, you still decided to distribute such
modules. What you are complaining about?

The point is that it's impossible to make it illegal (although many of
the authors of the kernel would like to) -- the point is that if kernel
modules aren't derivative works of the kernel, the kernel license cannot
control them.
