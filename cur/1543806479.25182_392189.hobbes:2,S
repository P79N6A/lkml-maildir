Large number of boilerplate bit operations which are written in C-language
are scattered around include/asm-*/bitops.h.
This patch series gathers them into include/asm-generic/bitops/*.h .
It will be the benefit to:
- kill duplicated code and comment (about 4000 lines)
- use better C-language equivalents
- help porting new architecture
Major changes since previous version:
- put each class of bitop into its own header file in asm-generic/bitops/
- change __ffs()
- fix warning fix
Todo:
- improve hweight*() routines
