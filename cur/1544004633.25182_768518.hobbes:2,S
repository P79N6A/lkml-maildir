humans are the priority targets for tracer output - tools are a 
distant second target. Whatever is nice for humans is also usually 
easy to process via tools. A tool can set an option flag just fine.
To help tooling, add a trace_options flag for more predictable/faster 
output. We already have the binary output format for example.

yes, your proposal is fine.

yes - and make the defaults for flags favor human visual parsing.

i'd suggest spaces for the function indentation, because we'll also 
have quite deep call stacks in practice.
and i'd suggest you flip around the cost field to something like:
 [...]
               getnstimeofday() {
                set_normalized_timespec() {
                 clocksource_read() { 
 ( 1547 ns)       acpi_pm_read()                     
 ( 1951 ns)      } clocksource_read()
 ( 2200 ns)     } set_normalized_timespec()
 ( 2354 ns)    } getnstimeofday()
that makes it fixed-width up to the inevitable variable-length field, 
the function name.
