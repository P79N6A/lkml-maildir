For that, a forced 48-bit hwif->addressing inherited by drives will
suffice. And I agree, we should have that.
See, the logic in the kernel right now is just to check whether the
drive supports 48-bit commands. If it does, we use them like we would
28-bit commands. We eat the extra overhead, and do nothing to take
advantage of it (except using big drives, of course). What's the
logic in that?!

Then you just recreate those commands, there's absolutely no need for
anything special in this case. And the current patch neither explicitly
allows or disallows anything that the stock kernel doesn't.
If you are doing that from userspace by sending in taskfiles with the
appropriate commands, then you just create the commands like you want
them. rq_lba48() just checks whether file system requests should be
executed with 28 or 48-bit commands. If you send in taskfiles (your
SG_IO example), you have complete control over this already.
