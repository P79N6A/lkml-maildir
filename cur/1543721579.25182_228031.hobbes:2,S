Yep, IRQ 11 is a bit crowded...
I was just about to ask a similar question...
How do I have a better interrupt table (no or less shared intrerupts) with ACPI?
My system (just rebooted) says:
 $ cat /proc/interrupts 
           CPU0       
  0:    1434691    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       5158    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  8:          2    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 14:       8097    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:        959    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 19:     105118   IO-APIC-level  nvidia
 20:      17455   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd, eth0, NVidia nForce2
 21:          0   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
 22:      16156   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
NMI:          0 
LOC:    1434624 
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
The "problem" here might be IRQ 20 when I am using my scanner@4800dpi (USB2.0, Epson GT-X700) writing the output via NFS (through eth0). Will test the numbers some other time.
Kalin.
