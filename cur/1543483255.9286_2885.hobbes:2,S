OK, fuckwit you asked for it. 
1) The size of the sources has nothing to do with the size of the compiled
kernel.
2) There's nothing stopping you from compiling the kernel on a better
specified machine and copying the resulting binary to your under endowed
machine
3) This mailing list isn't for problems of this nature. MCIBTYC.
4) If you're gagging for it, you can delete some of the stuff you
obviously don't need in the sources and make your own "Baby-Linux" kernel
source tree.
5) You've proved that you're a knobhead of the highest order in not
listening to those of us who _do_ know better. I'm not kidding.
Go away, FUD-for-brains.
