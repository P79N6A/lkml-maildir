Hmm. If we had kcmalloc then we may be able to add a zero bit to the slab 
allocator. If we would obtain zeroed pages for the slab then we may skip 
zeroing of individual entries. However, the cache warming effect of the 
current zeroing is then not occurring. Not sure if this would make sense 
but this is a possible optimization if we had kcmalloc.
