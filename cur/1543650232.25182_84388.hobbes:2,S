That's OK, I'm still 1500 behind 8(
	If all current uses are embedded, can we remove the "void
*arg" and reduce the size of struct rcu_head by 25%?  Users can always
embed it in their own struct which has a "void *arg", but if that's
the uncommon case, it'd be nice to slim it a little.
	It'd also be nice to change the double linked list to a single
too: as far as I can tell the only issue is the list_add_tail in
call_rcu(): how important is this ordering?  It can be done by keeping
a head as well as a tail pointer if required.
I'd be happy to prepare a patch, to avoid more complaints of bloat 8)

We must be looking at different variants of the patch.  This one does:
IPC_RMID -> freeary() -> ipc_rcu_free -> kmalloc.
Cheers,
Rusty.
