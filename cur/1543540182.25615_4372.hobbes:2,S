Regardless, the pointing of perl (or any other program) at /usr/local/* is
_the sysadmin's responsibility_, not the distributor's.  There isn't any
need for the packager of the distribution to point things at /usr/local;  
and even if you _do_ insist (as a packager) to do this, then the (obvious)
solution is to make sure that perl doesn't complain if its "use lib" path
doesn't exist, and wait until you're actually building that CPAN module to
make the directory there.
This is really a non-problem.
