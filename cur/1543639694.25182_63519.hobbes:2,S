Of course this delay-loop code will delay a diff. amount of time
depending on processor speed. Don't we have the bogomips stuff
exactly for this sort of small wait times?
What about using internal time-counters from various processors (think
RTDSC on i586+ and it's equivalent on PowerPC, for a start...)
I can still the shakeout when most code which assumed 7mhz 68000
processors for timming got to run on 14mhz 68020 with caches
on the amiga world... your floppies would change tracks a little
bit too fast :)
