The high-res-timers patch does most of this (all but the ntp
knob).  It allows you to use either the TSC or the ACPI pm
timer to keep clock time.  The former is fast, but some
systems are known to "mess" with the TSC as part of power
management.  The pm timer, being I/O, takes more time to
read, but is not "messed" with.

Actually the "best" option would be something like the
decrementer in the PPC.  It can be set to generate an
interrupt at just about any time.  Another HW register
(64-bits) keeps track of (effectively) decrementer clocks
since boot and can be used as the clock source.  The best
solution  in the x86 platform, would be an additional
register that either counts down at TSC speed to an
interrupt OR compares to the TSC and interrupts on compare. 
It should be a cpu register to avoid the latencies of
accessing an I/O register.

Not really a big problem.  The conversion constants are
computed once (or at ntp correction) and from then on all
one does is mpy and shift instructions to do the
conversion.  (Again, see the HRT patch.)

As I imply above, the one shot, if done as an I/O device, is
less than optimal.  Better is the PPC decrementer.
