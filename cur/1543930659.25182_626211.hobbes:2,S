Yes, the thing is that I'm fairly convinced that an out to an unused port 
takes sort of exactly 1 us (8 cycles at 8 MHz). That's what I've always 
known it to be at least and have taken as the point. The same's also said 
here for example:
http://tldp.org/HOWTO/IO-Port-Programming-4.html
as well as in the bit of MINIX source in an earlier version of this thread:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2002/3/14/194
Oh, in fact, a few older posts by Alan himself:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2002/3/15/2
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/9/22/263
I'm not a hardware person as the level of actual electrical signals but if 
an earlier instance of Alan is disagreeing with the current one as well, I 
guess it's halfway safe to join that one...
Rene.
