The problem is that the schedule_timeout() is not precise. So if you pass
N to such function, your sleep interval can be ]N-1, N+1[
This w/out considering other latencies but looking only at how timers are
updated ( you can call schedule_timeout() immediately before a timer tick
or immediately after ). So if we want to be sure to sleep at least the
rounded up number of jiffies, we might end up sleeping one/two jiffies
more ( and this w/out accounting other latencies ). And this will lead to
the formula ( used by poll() ) :
Tj = (Tms * HZ + 999) / 1000 + 1
( if Tms > 0 )
