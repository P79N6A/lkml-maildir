Subject: problems mounting root partition with 2.5.48+ kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The bugzilla report can be found here:

I have both bzImage-2.5.47 and bzImage-2.5.50 sitting in /boot, both
compiled with the same kernel config. 2.5.47 boots and successfully
mounts root without any problems. 2.5.50 boots, but errors out with
'can't mount root device'. I've tried this with both XFS and ReiserFS as
my root filesystem, so I'm guessing it's not filesystem specific. I had
the same problem with 2.5.48 and 2.5.49. Both grub and modutils are at
the current version.
/dev/hda5 swap
/dev/hda6 /boot
/dev/hda7 /
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
NOTE: I'm not on the list so please CC me on the reply.
Thanks much,
Nate
