For the record, Alpha timings:
pca164 @ 533MHz:
  72.79: 19
   1.50: 20
  21.30: 35
   1.50: 36
   1.30: 105
ev6 @ 500MHz:
   2.43: 78
  72.13: 84
   2.55: 89
   5.87: 90
   1.38: 105
   5.94: 108
   1.36: 112
I wonder how much of that ev6 slowdown is due to an SRM that's
has to handle both 3 and 4 level page tables, and how much is
due to the more expensive syncing of the OOO pipeline...
