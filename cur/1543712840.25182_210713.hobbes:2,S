It's a bit early for that, I feel.  I'd like to see thing settle down a
little more at your end first, then see that Rajesh, Hugh and if possible
Ingo have had a good go through everything.
And then there are the mechanics of swallowing a largely-undocumented
4,600-line patch which touches 60 files and tosses 30-odd rejects across 16
files.
We have a way to go yet.  Once I've dumped a lot of the current pending
stuff into 2.6.6-early we'll be in better shape.
