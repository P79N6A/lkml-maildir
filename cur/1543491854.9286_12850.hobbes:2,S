Hi folks,
I would like to tune up the file descriptor limit of my 2.2.5 kernel.
I have found various bits of information on doing this with 2.0.x series
kernels and i was wondering if most of them will be valid with all the work
that has been done to the 2.2.x series?
I beleive it's 1024 by default (in the 2.2.x series), i would like to increase
the limit to 3000 as per the 2.0.x patches on a very busy mailserver.
Any advice appreciated,
Chris.
