Subject: [Patch 1/2]: ext3 reservation window size increase incorrectly fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Two ext3 reservation bug fixes.
In current reservation code (with or without the recent red-black tree
changes), when an existing old reservation is re-used as the new window
without adjusting it's position in the current per-filesystem tree, we
just need to update window's start and end block value, without any
remove/insert business. But we missed the the allocation hit ratio bit,
it is not reset.
Since this is the magic number used to determine whether the window size
should be doubled next time, this will cause the window size increase
incorrectly or too quickly.
Patch applies to 2.6.9-rc1-mm5, tested.
