The main reason people seems to still justify use dump/restore is --
believe it or not -- the inability to set atime.  One would think this
would be a trivial extension to the VFS, even if protected by a
capability (CAP_BACKUP?).
The ideal way to run backups I have found is on filesystems which
support atomic snapshots -- that way, your backup set becomes not only
safe (since it goes through the kernel etc. etc.) but totally
coherent, since it is guaranteed to be unchanging.  This is a major
win for filesystems which can do atomic snapshots, and I'd highly
encourage filesystem developers to consider this feature.
