   I get the same problem with this card. It takes my machine 90
minutes to reboot -- 30 to shut down, and 60 to restart, due to the
LVM tools scanning all of my drives. I've got a 120Gb SATA drive which
is just dead weight in this machine, I can't use it at all because of
these problems.
   Can anybody say exactly what the problem is, and how we might go
about fixing it? I haven't even seen anyone just saying "it's not
frobbing the foobar properly -- you need to get the docs from SiI to
work out why".

   I have been told by someone that the SIIG cards (with SiI3112A
chips) work under Linux. I can't confirm this, though.
