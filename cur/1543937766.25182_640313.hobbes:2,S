Which is pretty damn useful.
Think about it.  Don't you ever use const?  Is it ever only in the way?

Precisely, so why are we discussing this?
I claim that const is useful. You claim that it can't solve all the worlds
problems. I agree with that, but I maintain it is still useful.
But, in order for it to be useful, it requires that people do not circumvent it
in the wrong places (such as kfree).
