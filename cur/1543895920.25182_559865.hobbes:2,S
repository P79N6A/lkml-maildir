A lot of awful things could happen to you or me _tomorrow_. Are you prepared
for everything? I'm not. If I'd try to be prepared for every possible 
disaster, you'd rightly call me mentally ill.
Even if my code is used on a Tivo-like device, I can sleep well and don't
need a different license. These are the _normal_ grey areas that _every_
license or law contains.

Well, maybe. Maybe this is a topic that needs further discussion.
But I don't find it very important as we're not in a situation where
we urgently need a new license.
