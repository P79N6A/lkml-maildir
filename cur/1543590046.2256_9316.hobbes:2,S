You probably have done:
gzip -dc linux-2.4.XX.tar.gz | tar zvf -
cd linux
gzip -dc patchXX.gz | patch -p0
which will fail since the patch file specifies all files with a path
starting with 'linux/'.  However, the instructions in the README are
for the following situation:
gzip -dc linux-2.4.XX.tar.gz | tar zvf -
gzip -dc patchXX.gz | patch -p0
which may work, but note that patch can be a little tempremental about
the filenames it chooses from the patch file.  The absolute safest way
to apply a patch is:
gzip -dc linux-2.4.XX.tar.gz | tar zvf -
cd linux
gzip -dc patchXX.gz | patch -p1
