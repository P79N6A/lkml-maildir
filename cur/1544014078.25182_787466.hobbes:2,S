Can *please* anybody else say something to this issue to calm this down?
To make it easier for you please sign:
[ ] The code is fine the way it is. Sascha go home.
[ ] The code could be better, but hey, it works and the world is not
    perfect.
[ ] No, we shouldn't abuse chained interrupts for internal irq
    dispatching.

That's one of the use cases for chained interrupts, yes.

The overflow interrupts are channel interrupts and should be handled by
the idmac code. Who else should know how to recover from a channel
overflow?

Then I propose to change all drivers this way. I want to see how
many interrupts in my network driver I get for errors, tx and so on, even
if only for debugging.

Yes, I know, but it was their idea to treat the channel status bits as
interrupts, even if they invented their own API instead of using the
existing one.
