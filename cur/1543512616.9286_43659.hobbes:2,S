Well if you have the request stuff as a WIP.......
I found several old __cli and ide__sti that dangle and never set a
spinlock.  These are not paired either and get set and cleard in different
calls.
There appears to be two levels of locking......
Well I'll be darned.....the butchering compiled.....
Oh, yeah
ide_hwgroup_t *hwgroup = HWGROUP(drive);
spin_lock_irqsave(&hwgroup->spinlock, flags);
spin_unlock_irqrestore(&hwgroup->spinlock, flags);
spin_lock_irqsave (&io_request_lock, flags);
spin_unlock_irqrestore (&io_request_lock, flags);
ide__sti(); (aka __sti();) -->> spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock);
__cli(); -->> spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
Almost all of "block" is littered with no spinlock calls.
Thus there are unlimited combinations of deadlock that can randomly clear
one or another by chance....you know the old russian game...BANG!!!!
