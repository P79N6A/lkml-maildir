None of them can go away.
Security identifiers are for the operation you perform.  For example 
open_secure() is so that you can specify the security context for a new file 
that you are creating.  connect_secure() is used to specify the security 
context of the socket you want to connect to.  In the default setup the only 
way that connect_secure() and open_secure() can use the same SID is for unix 
domain sockets (which are labeled with file types).  A TCP connection will be 
to a process, the SID of a process is not a valid type label for a file.
lstat_secure(), recv_secure() and others are used to retrieve the security 
context of the file, network message, etc.
