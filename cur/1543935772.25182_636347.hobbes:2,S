Probably so. If I respin, I'll plan to fix that too.

With this patch the lockd_down checks should now be BUGs. I decided
not to do that in lockd_up. If there's an error within the main
lockd loop, it can exit without being requested to do so. If someone
then calls lockd_up then the counts will be off and the check will fire.
It seems like if we're going to make the check in lockd_up be a BUG,
then we should also BUG rather than letting lockd exit prematurely.
