If you think Linux should be improved, you won't find many to
contradict you on this list.  If however you think that the
bugs you see will vanish by magic without your detailed bug
report, you unfortunately are mistaken.
So, if anything is wrong with hwclock, report in detail to the maintainer.
(Hint: that's me - aeb@cwi.nl)
In case you think that the bug might in fact be a linux kernel bug,
cc to this list.
Bug reports, in detail, that is what we need.
Not vague muttering `should be fixed'.
