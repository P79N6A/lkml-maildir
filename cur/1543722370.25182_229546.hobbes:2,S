This patch fixes a real bug in the detection of the active PHY when the
hardware is slightly broken and reports multiple PHY trancievers. Jeff
has some issues with the patch, but said he would check on them.
Since Dominik's NIC stoppen working in 2.6.7-mm1, there is some change
in that version that broke the driver, but the patch in discussion here
is the same (reversed) that I wrote and test with Dominik.
