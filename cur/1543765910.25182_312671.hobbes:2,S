Sorry for the late answer.
Ok, lets try again. The hole fixed by this patch only covers
the case of an kernel thread with lazy mm doing some memory access
(or more likely the CPU doing a prefetch there). But ELF loading
never happens in lazy mm kernel threads.AFAIK in a "real" process
the TLB is always fully consistent.
Does that explanation satisfy you? 
I agree that my earlier one was a bit dubious because I argued about
the direct mapping, but the argv setup actually uses user addresses.
But I still think it must be something else.
