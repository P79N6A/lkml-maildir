Alessandro's...and that other guy's...:)

As you noted, that didn't happen.  My guess is you ran out of memory.  The
requests you are generating will be, shall we say, easily merged in the
block subsystem.  So you have a bunch of requests in the device's queue,
but each one will have a long chain of buffer heads hanging off it.  You
may not have even managed to use up all the available request structures
before things came to a halt.  Try dropping the max_sectors[] count way
down, and things might work a little better.  After your fsck completes,
that is.
