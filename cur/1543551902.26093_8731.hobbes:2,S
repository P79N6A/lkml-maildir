I've got an Asus P2B-L mobo, which has an integrated eepro100, and an
DEC Tulip PCI card.  I've been running 2.2.16. To use a new ATA/100 card
I tried 2.4-test10-pre3.
All worked well, indeed very well, except 2.4 switched eth0 and eth1
from 2.2.x.  That is, the Tulip became eth0, rather than eth1 and the
eepro100 became eth1.
It took me a looong time to figure out the problem. I spent hours
figuring I had driver trouble. Once seen, easily fixed. But even then,
it's a pain to boot 2.2.x.
Now I find that ether= won't work for PCI cards ( the Ethernet HOWTO
needs to be corrected )!!
This is an odd sort of bug ( feature? ) that will drive users of
multi-nic machines nuts when 2.4 is rolled out. Hopefully it's only for
my sort of setup.
