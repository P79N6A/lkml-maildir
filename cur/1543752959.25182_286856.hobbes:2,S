Subject: [patch] Real-Time Preemption, -RT-2.6.11-rc1-V0.7.35-00
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

i have released the -V0.7.35-00 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
The two dozen split out latency patches (including PREEMPT_BKL) that
were in -mm are in BK now, so i've rebased the -RT patchset to
2.6.11-rc1. It would be nice to check for regressions (or the lack of
them), to make sure everything latency-related has been properly merged
upstream from -mm. (so that a new splitup cycle can start.)
to create a -V0.7.34-00 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.10.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.11-rc1.bz2
