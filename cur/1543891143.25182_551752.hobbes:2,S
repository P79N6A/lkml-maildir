Then I should probably leave the redundant 
if (boot_cpu_data.f00f_bug)
test in do_f00f_workaround so that configuration where cond_calls are
not enabled still behave the same way as before. The redundant test will
make the case when cond calls are present a little slower, but we still
have the improvement when the architecture does not need the workaround.
I could also wrap this test in a #ifndef CONFIG_COND_CALL, but it seems
ugly.
Also, since the default is not to set the CF_STATIC_ENABLE flag, the
workaround won't be compiled in the kernel if the conditional calls are
configured out.
The question that arises is : what should be the default behavior of a
cond_call when the cond_calls are configured out? Active, active only
if the CF_STATIC_ENABLE flags is set or inactive?
