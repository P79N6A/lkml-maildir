README.ecpa has been unchanged since at least 2.4.18, and the maintainer is no 
longer maintaining it in-kernel for 2.6.  Digi has a maintained version on their 
website.  The document details the user-space programs needed for firmware 
loading, and the version at Digi's website is maintained.
README.scc is fundamentally unchanged since at least 2.2.20.  That's my reason for 
removing it.  The file it points to was also last updated in the 2.2 kernel series 
- I need to get a more complete LXR setup here at home to pin it down more 
accurately.  It's for an AX.25 network adapter, and has no need to be in drivers/char.
