    It should never be decremented or incremented - this one should remain
relatively static.  The host_busy field indicates the number of commands
currently running on the HBA.
    I am seeing a bug however - in the event that can_queue is 0, the theory
was that we would go ahead and send the command down anyways and if the HBA
driver was busy it would simply reject it.  Instead we are falling through
into the ->command interface, which isn't at all what we want.
