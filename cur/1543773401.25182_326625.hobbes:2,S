Well, even if you could make the correct assembly, you would
not be able to run the BIOS-based program that you show. As
soon as you execute the interrupt 0x10, your program will seg-fault
because it is an invalid instruction in user-mode code and
would even cause an invalid oprand fault in kernel mode.
The second problem with your code is that __all__ of the assembly
for the entire procedure must be written in one block, not
with seperate "asm" instructions. This is because 'C' isn't
going to preserve the values in the registers between "asm"
blocks.
