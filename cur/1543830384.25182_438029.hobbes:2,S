I agree with the direction of your thoughts.
I was trying to do a similar thing, define clear steps in network
namespace merging.
My first patchset covers devices but not sockets.
The only difference from what you're suggesting is ipv4 routing.
For me, it is not less important than devices and sockets.  May be even
more important, since routing exposes design deficiencies less obvious at
socket level.

Fine
Can you summarize you objections against my way of handling devices, please?
And what was the typo you referred to in your letter to Kirill Korotaev?
