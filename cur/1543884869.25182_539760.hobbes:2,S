    Why is this not for end-users?  Will it not trigger anything
useful unless set up properly, or is a big performace hit -- and how,
or what?
    All the kernel debug options are underdocumented this way -- I'd
like to have as many of them on as I can without absolutely killing
performance, (or rather, *you* would) -- but I can never tell without
grovelling all over for the info, which... well, I haven't done it
yet, anyway.
    "End-user" is just insufficently defined for anyone compiling
their own kernel.  Could you add a bit more text here describing what
the effect of physically discontiguous high-memory stacks is?  An
additional frobnitz dereference on every badda-bing badda-bang, likely
to double the time it takes to dance the hokey pokey?
   *shrug*  Some of those debug options probably don't get set very
often on kernels that are run for more than to see if it boots.
