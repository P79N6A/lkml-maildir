Assuming I can actually fit in better with the new driver model.  As
far as hot-plug.  It is an abuse but I regularly hot-swap my rom chips
in my development system.
I am probably looking at this from the wrong angle but my problem with
current code base seems to be that I can only have one driver per pci
device.
In any case I would like to have code that fits in nicely with the
new driver system.  I can take about one change in kernel API.  For
the most part the drivers are trivial, and having non-trivial
maintenance for trivial code is less than ideal.
