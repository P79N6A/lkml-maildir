In my script, its one line:
mkinitrd -f initrd-$VER.img $VER && \
where $VER is the shell variable I edit to = the version number, located at 
the top of the script.
Unforch, its failing:
No module pata_amd found for kernel 2.6.24, aborting.
This is with pata_amd turned off and its counterpart under ATA/RLL/etc turned 
on.  So something is still dependent on it.  I do have one sata drive, on an 
accessory card in the box, so I need the rest of the sata_sil and friends 
stuff.  Its my virtual tapes for amanda.  Also home built, the amanda 
security model cannot be successfully bent into the shape of an rpm.  They 
BTW are #2 on coverity's list of most secure software.
So I've rebuilt 2.6.24 as it originally was, and added the acpi timer line to 
the 2.6.24-rc8 stanza's kernel argument list.  It will boot one or the other 
when I next reboot.  Its been about 8 hours since the last error was logged, 
which is totally weirdsville to this old fart.  Phase of the moon maybe?  The 
visit to the sawbones to see about my heart?  They are going to fit me with a 
30 day recorder tomorrow, my skip a beat problem is getting worse.  The sort 
of stuff that goes with the 7nth decade I guess.  Officially, I'm wearing out 
me, too much sugar, too many times nearly electrocuted=shingles yadda 
yadda. :-)  Oh, and don't forget Arther, he moved in uninvited about 25 years 
ago too.  Those people that talk about the golden years?  They're full of 
excrement...
