Hmm. When a page is in a process address space, the kernel *can* access it,
at least as long as that process is the running one: access it from the
process' address space. If the process calls a write() or whatever else that
a) is blocking, so the kernel must choose another process to run
b) uses a buffer that the kernel must be able to access in order to complete
   the call
then the kernel would need to copy the buffer in a part of RAM that it has
direct access to. It's annoying, but the same kind of things happens when
reading/writing memory through ISA DMA from/to pages above the 16MB limit:
the kernel has to do a copy from the pages above 16MB to some pages below 16MB,
which are DMA-able.
Change 16MB -> 1GB and you'll see it's the same problem.
The only difference is the 16MB limit is an hardware one,
while the 1GB limit is a software one.

I hope my example above solves this objection.
