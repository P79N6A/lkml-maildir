Rick,
	There are cleanup issues in sysfs previous reported by others.
	The patch below previously sent to the list by patmans and
	myself helps in repeated insmod / rmmod / shutdown testing of
	scsi modules for us. We have not seen the null parent pointer
	problem you are seeing which causes your objects to show up
	under /sys/ (YMMV).
