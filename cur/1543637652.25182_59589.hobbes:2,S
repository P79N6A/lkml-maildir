If I can poke at the malice & sufficiency bits, the workloads
triggering pagetable memory exhaustion seem to be:
(1) forking server
(2) memory-sharing constellation of processes
(3) university workload, i.e. [tens of] thousands of idle /bin/sh's etc.
(4) someone mapping a large object (64-bit)
(5) large address space coverage over time with mmap/mremap/etc. (64-bit)
(4) and (5) both involve only a single task, largely innocent of trying
to do anything industrial-strength. Yes. It's that easy to do.
Databases on 32-bit appear to be hybrids of (1) and (2), and on 64-bit,
combinations of (1), (2), (4), and (5).
Of these workloads, only (2) is feasible through pagetable sharing and
cooperation from userspace, and only (4) is feasible though large pages
and cooperation from userspace. All of these exceed physical memory
bounds, not just virtual, and hence none are solved by pte-highmem.
64-bit doesn't have highmem so (4) and (5) are immune to it anyway. The
failure mode is typically deadlock, but SCSI panics were often seen in
2.4.x, along with other nondeterministic failures.
Feasible database workloads on 32-bit machines running mainline kernels
seem to run with between 50% and 90% of physical memory consumed by
process pagetables and severe restrictions on the number of clients
that attempt to connect. When larger proportions of memory are consumed
by process pagetables, kernel deadlock often ensues.
Cheers,
Bill
