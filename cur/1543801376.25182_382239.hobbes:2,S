And?  There's no particular problem with host system calls being under
a lock.  And the various other stuff is a kfree and a free_irq, which
I don't think have a problem being called under a spinlock.

Probably?  What in there is sensitive to being called under a lock?

That would increase the amount of code, with no gain that I can see.
The list_del would be duplicated, and the loop in winch_cleanup would
have to drop and reacquire the lock around each call to free_winch.
