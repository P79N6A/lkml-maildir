Bugger, you're right.
On my Cyrix III box before..
 CPU: After vendor init, caps: 00803135 80803035 00000000 00000000
 CPU:     After generic, caps: 00803135 80803035 00000000 00000000
 CPU:             Common caps: 00803135 80803035 00000000 00000000
and after..
 CPU: After vendor init, caps: 00803135 80000000 00000000 00000000
 CPU:     After generic, caps: 00803135 80000000 00000000 00000000
 CPU:             Common caps: 00803135 80000000 00000000 00000000

Sounds reasonable to me, unless Patrick has a preferred way of fixing 
this problem.
