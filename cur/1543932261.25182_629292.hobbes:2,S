Has anyone *proven* that using uninitialized data this way is safe?  As 
a *user* of this stuff, I'm *very* hesitant to trust Linux's RNG when I 
hear things like this.  (Hint: most protocols are considered insecure 
until proven otherwise, not the other way around.)
Consider:  add_entropy_words is reversible [1], presumably in the sense 
that words could be removed, so, if there added words are independent of 
the state, there is no loss of entropy.  But it also appears reversible 
in the sense that if the pool has a known state and entropy words are 
added, most of which are known, the unknown ones can be found (if 
nothing else, if there are only a few bits of entropy there, you can try 
all possibilities).
Now imagine a security program.  It runs some forward secret protocol 
and it's very safe not to leak data that would break forward secrecy 
(mlockall, memset when done with stuff, etc).  It runs on a freshly 
booted machine (no DSA involved, so we're not automatically hosed), so 
an attacker knows the initial pool state.  Conveniently, some *secret* 
(say an ephemeral key, or, worse, a password) gets mixed in to the pool. 
  There are apparently at most three bytes of extra data mixed in, but 
suppose the attacker knows add the words that were supposed to get mixed 
in.  Now the program clears all its state to "ensure" forward secrecy, 
and *then* the machine gets hacked.  Now the attacker can learn (with at 
most 2^24 guesses worth of computation) 24 bits worth of a secret, which 
could quite easily reduce the work involved in breaking whatever forward 
secret protocol was involved from intractable to somewhat easy.  Or it 
could leak three bytes of password.  Or whatever.
Sorry for the somewhat inflammatory email, but this is absurd.
