I found out why $DEVICE did not show of in /sbin/hotplug
any more. (2.6.10-rc1-bk5)
Depending on the setting of CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS
either the environment variables DEVICE or PRODUCT
which should be passed to /sbin/hotplug become overwritten
by the environment variable SEQNUM.
This happens in kobject_hotplug() of lib/kobject_uevent.c.
The here called hotplug_ops->hotplug function usb_hotplug()
advances both, the index to envp and the pointer into buffer
but the calling function gets no notice of that.
So to add SEQNUM later on it advances index/pointer to
envp/buffer from where it has stopped before calling
usb_hotplug(), thus overwriting the first entry that 
usb_hotplug() has added before.
