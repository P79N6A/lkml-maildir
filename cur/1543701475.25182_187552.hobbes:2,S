Good.  I guess we need to make net_ratelimit() use this sometime.

This seems a bit odd.  It means that the further apart the message bursts
are, the longer they are allowed to be.  Or something.
Wouldn't it be better to say "after each greater-than-five second window,
allow up to ten printk's as long as they happen in the next five
milliseconds"?
