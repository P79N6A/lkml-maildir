Ah, forgotten about that.
Unfortunately the latency tracer patch doesn't compile either:
  CC      kernel/latency_trace.o
kernel/latency_trace.c:28:21: error: asm/rtc.h: No such file or directory
kernel/latency_trace.c:63:3: error: #error Implement cycles_to_usecs.
kernel/latency_trace.c: In function ‘____trace’:
kernel/latency_trace.c:658: error: implicit declaration of function ‘irqs_disabled_flags’
make[1]: *** [kernel/latency_trace.o] Error 1
