I assume this is serious. Therefore, I answer.
cd /usr/src/linux-2.2.16
make modules
make modules_install
You should be able to test your changes without having to reboot
and without overwriting the existing (working) driver. If you are
doing a lot of work, I suggest you make a script:
#!/bin/bash
ifconfig eth0 down
rmmod 3c90x
insmod /usr/src/linux-2.2.16/drivers/net/3c90x.o
ifconfig eth0 xx.xx.xx.xx netmask mm.mm.mm.mm broadcast bb.bb.bb.bb
route add -net xx.xx.xx.0 netmask mm.mm.mm.mm broadcast dev eth0
route add default gw (etc)
Once you have verified that your revised driver works as intended,
then you do `make modules_install` to put it into the correct place
for the next boot.
Cheers,
