LTC test has updated the 2.5 test runs on both the ltp and osdl site.
The actual pages for the ltp site is:
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/execmatrix.php
or OSDL site is:
http://www.osdl.org/projects/26lnxstblztn/results/linstab-web/ltc/execut25_324rev1.html
We continue to be able to do longer runs (96 hours and greater) on both
PPC64 and IA32.  New runs were done on 2.5.72 kernel.
Work has just start on 2.5.73 and both plans will be updated once the
runs complete.
Overall, testing is improving although we did have a few problems with
2.5.71.
