So you mean that you want to be able to sleep, and then contine
approximately where you left off, without keeping any kind of
reference count on the last cgroup that you touched? OK, so in that
case I agree that you would need some kind of hierarch

A crucial difference is that your css_tryget() fails if the cgroups
framework is trying to remove the cgroup but might abort due to
another subsystem holding a reference, whereas mine spins and if the
rmdir is aborted it will return a refcount.

OK, fair enough.
