You can take your clues from the get_pid algo and implementation.
The currently correct way to do this is to 
scan all tasks and figure out whether either of pid, gid, tgid .. is using 
your questioned pid number for small number of task this should be
trivial timewise, for large number of task its a different story
Bill Irwin is working on a patch that release pids upon their last usage
and such thing could then be recorded in a bitmap. Checking availability
would simply then mean checking a particular bit.
I have a patch lying around to move pid allocation to a bitmap.
