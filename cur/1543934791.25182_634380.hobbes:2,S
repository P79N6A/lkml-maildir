Oh, Andi, you're so right! I don't like to admit that, but you're
right (in my case at least). I counted four clean-up patches I sent
since last 'really bug fix' I made patch. Actually I thought that
really helps the kernel but it seems it doesn't and causes more
problem with patch applience (unfortunately).
