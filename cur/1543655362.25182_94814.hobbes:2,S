Hello all,
   While 'make bzImage', I received the following error...
arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c:610: parse error before `*'
arch/i386/mm/hugetlbpage.c: In function `hugetlb_sysctl_handler':

I've attached a possible patch for the issue, since noticed these same 
error in a previous kernel. There have also been other patches that seem 
to do the same then...fix the error.
