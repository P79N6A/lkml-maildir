David,
    I checked in gdb and ltrace code. None of them are using PPC_PTRACE* 
options to get register values.
Man page also doesn't mention these options. Once this is fixed, these 
options could be added to man page also.
Irrespective of whether we fix this, documentation of these options in 
manpage will clarify its usage I guess.
Thanks, Supriya
