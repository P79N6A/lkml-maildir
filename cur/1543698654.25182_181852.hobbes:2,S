You cannot copyright an API - people have been down that path before in 
the proprietry software community and have not succeeded. You can 
copyright the code in the header files, but does simply using the header 
files to build a program mean that the driver is now infected? If the 
header files include lots and lots of inline functions that ended up 
compiled into the code, then maybe.
Then again, it appears that most developers are using wrapped to avoid 
this situation, such that their private code does not include any Linux 
headers, only the GPL'ed wrapper.
So we go in circles again.
