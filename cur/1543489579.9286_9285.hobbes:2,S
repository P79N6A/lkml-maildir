        Hi,
        [sorry for the offtopic, but some of you may be interested]
        We are sorry to communicate that the server holding the
linux-usb* mailing lists had a crash yesterday. Some files went berzek
and fsck had to kill them. Most of them where re-installable [thx
Debian!].
        But following Murphy's law, the _only_ majordomo files which
died where the linux-usb* subscription lists [nor even the other data
files!]. I've been able to recover from the archives, so if you were
subscribed, you're suggested to re-subscribe again, sending the
messages:
subscribe linux-usb
subscribe linux-usb-announce
to majordomo@peloncho.fis.ucm.es.
        Sorry for the inconvenience, and thank you for reading :)
