I wonder how this can work:
a motherboard with i815 chipset (integrated VGA), Video BIOS is 
integrated into system BIOS
a PCI card inserted into one of the PCI slots, configured as primary in 
system BIOS
During POST, the PCI card BIOS is initialized. I boot Windows 98SE - 
then the onboard VGA initializes and I can use 2 monitors.
So either:
1. The driver can initialize the onboard VGA on its own (without VGA BIOS)
or
2. There is a way how to get the onboard VGA BIOS code from system BIOS
