Subject: [PATCH] fix for RPM build target under newer versions

Hi all,
	I notice there's an "rpm" target in the Makefile, which seems broken 
under RH 8.0. This may also apply to some "bleeding-edge" versions of 
Mandrake and Suse. Specifically, RH "split" the RPM build process into a 
separate utility from the old style rpm command. This could be fixed 
with a few aliases to keep backwards compatibility a bit easier. I 
wonder why an RH install doesn't already do this?
The reason why I'm sending this is because it's in the Makefile itself. 
If it wasn't for that, I'd just use the aliases mentioned above.
