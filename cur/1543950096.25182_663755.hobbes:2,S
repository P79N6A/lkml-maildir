There are some legitimate uses of !x & y which are actually of the form !x 
& !y, where x and y are function calls.  That is a not particularly 
elegant way of getting both x and y to be evaluated and then combining the 
results using "and".  If such code is considered acceptable, then perhaps 
the sparse patch should be more complicated.
