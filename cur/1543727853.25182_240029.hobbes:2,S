Nothing I could find.
suspend to disk with swsusp in 2.6.8-rc3-mm1 does not work at all for me,
I just get a oops longer than screen height after resume, which I can't
capture because my thinkpad r40e does not have a serial port.
sorry, but I didnt test with it after creating this patch.
suspend to disk with softwaresuspend 2 works mostly, I just need to
remove and reload the snd_ali5154 soundmodule after resume, and mplayer
output with -vo xv is broken.
pmdisk in 2.6.7-mm5 worked with the same problems as softwaresuspend 2 in
the newer kernel.
