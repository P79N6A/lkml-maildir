It will be assembled by taskstats. But afaict, the sending of data by the netlink layer will
be halted within netlink_broadcast(), which is a couple of calls down the call path from
genlmsg_multicast(), which is used by taskstats uses to send data out.
Lets discuss turning off of taskstats assembly separately.
Jamal, Thomas,
If there are no listeners on a genetlink socket, do you think overhead of kernel paths that
continue to attempt sending multicast data on genetlink sockets is an issue ?
