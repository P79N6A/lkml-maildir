this is why the windows driver uses heuristics to decide when the laptop 
is possibly unstable and *may* fall soon... because it takes something 
like 700ms to actually park.  (a url floated by with the whitepaper-level 
details at some point.)
btw -- my usual box is a t42p running winxp, and i disable the parking 
code... whatever my normal usage is tends to trigger the parking 
heuristics too readily.  it's a cool idea, but i'm skeptical of its 
real-world value.
as for other details it's trivial to lock the daemon in memory and run it 
at nice -4 to get a head start on parking even when at 100% cpu and under 
memory load.
