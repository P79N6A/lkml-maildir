Yep, I picked up another one that was easy to make lockless (I'll send
out a new patchset soon), however the tagged lookup that was under read
lock is changed to a spin lock.
It shouldn't be too difficult to make the tag lookups (find_get_pages_tag)
lockless, however I just haven't gotten around to looking at the write
side of the tagging yet.
When that is done, there should be no more read locks at all.
