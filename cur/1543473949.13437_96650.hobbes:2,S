Maybe i am blind but i cant see that point ? If an entry in the
Arp cache does NOT exist we dont accept it by this behaviour.
So where is the possibility of arp spoofing here ?
Only if An Arp Cache Entry exists, and the packet matches the Entry
coming in matches correcty we restart the timer.
Only problem i might see is a performance loss as for every packet
we have to search the Arp table ... Ok - forget it - just a silly thought.
