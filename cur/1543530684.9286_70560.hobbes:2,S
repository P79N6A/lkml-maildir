Howdy, I'm working on adding 802.1Q VLAN support to the Linux kernel,
and need some driver help, if possible.
The problem is that VLAN pkts need a extra 4 bytes in their header, and
many (not all) drivers will not accept the larger pkts.  This means that
to actually get them to work I have to set the MTU on the VLAN interface
to 1496, instead of 1500.  This is a hack at best, and really means that
the driver/card combo will not work in a production VLAN environment.
When you are working on the drivers, could you see if you can fix
them so they can accept/send the larger pkts?
If you'd like to download my vlan patch for testing/whatever,
you can find it at:

Thanks,
Ben
