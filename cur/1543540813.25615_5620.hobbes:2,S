mm.. There are two fairly separate requirements here - the first is to not
block interrupts for so long.  The need_resched/schedule() requirement is
icing on that cake and IMO comes a long way behind in importance.  I guess
you can bird both these stones at the same time.
BTW, it's fun to say rude things about the console code but we should
understand that it is a difficult problem.  Memory-mapped video displays are
schizophrenic: they are character devices and hence should talked to via
queues.  But they're fast and random access, so we also want synchronous
write semantics.  But they're stateful so we end up where we are today.
Good luck with the console project in 2.5 :)
