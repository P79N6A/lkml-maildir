	And yet you would need to be root to do this, and I would suspect
it *much* more likely a clueless root user would cat junk to /dev/sda than
a program run as root which uses ioctl's would clobber it's own memory
space and nuke the disk.  Probably alot more likely any such program would
segfault before doing much actually.
