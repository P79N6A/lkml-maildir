I like these changes.
I did notice that the new drivers/.../efivars.c is not identical to
the old arch/ia64/kernel/efivars.c (the hints to emacs were removed).
I like the emacs hint removal, but didn't review patch for any other
differences.
Any plans to consolidate other bits from efi.c?  There are a number
of things there that look like they could be shared:
	is_available_memory()
	efi_init()
		(mostly)
	efi_initialize_iomem_resources()
		(i386 only today, but I think we'd like it for ia64 also)
	efi_mem_type()
	efi_mem_attributes()
		(the i386 versions look slightly buggy in that they
		assume a fixed descriptor size, so old kernels won't
		work with new firmware that adds stuff to the descriptor)
