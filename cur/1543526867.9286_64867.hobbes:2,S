sendmail is SUID root here, no httpd around. pop3d, imap and a whole lot of
other daemons run from inetd and get their input pre-opened. ftpd is SUID
root as it has to do a chroot(2).

The idea is sound and has been checked. What is needed is to fill in
details that only extensive use will tell you how to do right: What
capabilities do you define, what programs get which ones of them. Then you
need to convince the whole world to port their favorite servers (MTA, FTP,
HTTP, ...) to the new scheme, while keeping them working on less
enlightened operating systems and ones with a completely different idea of
capabilities. No amount of test programs will tell you how Trusted White
Socks Linux will hold up in sysadmin's hands and under fire from crackers
and other vermin from all over the place. IMO, those are the real questions
now. And if you reread at the Halloween papers, this is exactly the kind of
challenge (no beaten path to follow) that Microsoft predicted the OSS
community would not be able to tackle. I think we are going to prove them
wrong (again), but it _is_ a difficult road ahead.
