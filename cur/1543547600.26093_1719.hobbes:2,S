Subject: eepro driver broke in 2.2.16... (at least for me!)

Hello,
I just upgraded to the 2.2.16 kernel (from 2.2.14) and compiled a new
kernel.  I immediately started having problems with my eepro/10 card.
It would run for a short period of time, then die on me.  If I reloaded
the module, it would run for a short period of time then die again.
My next step was to recompile the 2.2.16 kernel *exactly* as I had done
with the 2.2.14 kernel before - making sure all options were exactly the
same and saying "no" to the new options available in 2.2.16.  I still had
the same problem.
I then replaced the "Drivers/net/eepro.c" in 2.2.16 with the one from
2.2.14 and now it is working perfectly.
I'm running the eepro as eth1, irq10, 0x300.
I'm running 3c503 as eth0, irq9, 0x330.
Has anyone else had this problem?
