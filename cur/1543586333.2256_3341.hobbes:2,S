In my case, when lilo boots my G450 on any video mode other than
'normal', going into X and then back into console, leads to a blank
screen. I've observed this behavior in 2.2 and 2.4. Otherwise, I've no
problem using the card in single or dual head.
Since the HAL lib is a binary, we might have to wait for Matrox to fix
this problem.
