Hi,
Completely reproducible (but I don't want to :-) e2fsck dumps core
with a sig 11, just before it marks out 35GB /usr1 volume clean.  Core 
file available on request.  It did this 3 times before I got round the 
problem by zeroing out the check frequency field in /etc/fstab
The symptom is that it runs through pass 1-5 with no errors reported,
then prints the usual files summary, then dies.
Machine is RH 6.0 with kernel 2.2.13, on a dual PII 350  
[root@home /]# e2fsck -V
e2fsck 1.17, 26-Oct-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
        Using EXT2FS Library version 1.17, 26-Oct-1999
[root@home /]# file core
core: ELF 32-bit LSB core file of 'e2fsck' (signal 11), Intel 80386,
version 1
The last time the FS had to be checked it was with e2fsck v1.15, which 
worked fine.
Jon.
