The framebuffer is also so far behind. 9 out of 10 patches are 
dropped. The reason being is that everyone is a volunteer doing this in 
there spare time. We don't have the man power, hardware, nor the support 
to do the work that is needed. There are a huge number of drivers that 
could be included but never are. The companies we work for will not 
support the work we do in our spare time because there is no instant 
$$$$$. 
So what is going to be done about this? Will this be the usually hot air?
I seen this discussed before but nothiing ever happens :-( I don't see any 
one setting up to the plate.
