Everytime once in a while someone thinks that everything which can
be invented has been invented. Books like "The end of science". It's
pure hubris.
Around 1930 it was proven that is was impossible to travel to the
moon. Then mankind discovered multi stage rockets and nuclear energy
(not even needed for that).
It's incredible how narrow-minded established science sometimes is today
(and often has been past centuries). There is too much conservatism and
a general lack of imagination (though I must admit that no SF writer
could come up with something as bizarre as quantum mechanics, QED,
string theory and a few other things).
Software and more specific kernel development has quite a short history
compared to all of that. So, let's be humble and accept that what we
do today will most likely be considered a trivial joke when the next
century arrives.
You don't know what you do now know today.
