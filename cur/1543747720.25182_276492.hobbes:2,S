Thanks for working on these cleanups.  I've separately submitted a patch
to export security_member_sid via selinuxfs, as it is part of the
security policy API and is needed for further work on security
polyinstantiation (e.g. multi-level directory support), so please remove
the diffs related to removing that function.  Two other comments:
- Did you mean to make avtab_insert static (you only removed the
function prototype for it)?
- Shouldn't the AVC_CALLBACK_* definitions other than RESET be removed
since you are removing the other avc_ss interfaces?
Otherwise, the patch seems sane to me.
