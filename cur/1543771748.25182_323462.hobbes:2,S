Hi Andrew,
Attached are modified patch from zwane's feedback to earlier post.
Most of the other patches are pretty much the same, with no modifications.
Changes since last post.
- Removed call_lock before setting cpu_online_map
- Removed local_irq_disable() in play_dead() since safe_halt() enables it
  rightaway.
Cheers,
Ashok Raj
