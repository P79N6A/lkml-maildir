you're right the behaviour is the same with the old code and with your
patch that is:
If CONFIG_FLATMEM then free_area_init_node must be called:
free_area_init_node(..., ..., ..., ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, ...);
And it's quite dangerous because a user of this function must know the
implementation of pfn_to_page() or alloc_node_mem_map() to know that.
Therefore, what I proposed was to let free_area_init_node() work as
expected, so whatever the value of ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, this use
free_area_init_node(..., ..., ..., whatever, ...);
will define the start of mem as 'whatever' value. And if the user
wants to use the default start mem value then he can do both:
free_area_init_node(..., ..., ..., ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, ...);
or (equivalent):
free_area_init(...);

I would say that the first valid struct page in the system is
mem_map[PFN_UP(__pa(PAGE_OFFSET))] == mem_map[ARCH_PFN_OFFSET]

but they do have ARCH_PFN_OFFSET = 0, no ?
Walking mem_map[] directly should be avoid. 
If the mem start is different from 0 and ARCH_PFN_OFFSET is not set
then all patches are correct and mem_map[0] is valid.
But if the user set ARCH_PFN_OFFSET != 0, he tells to the system that
the start of memory is not 0, and mem_map[0] is now forbidden since no
page exist in this area. BTW the problem exists with the old code, if
the user do pfn_to_page(0), he will get an invalid page pointer.
