Hello,
Can anyone tell me how kernel threads (threads in the kernel space)
works in linux?
In other words, how can I schedule them like normal user-level threads?
It seems to me that are NOT schedulable like user-level
threads/processes in general since they are not
pre-emptible at all.
Is it right?
Thanks,
