Without your patch, the clock works perfectly when NTP is not in use,
but when NTP is in use I get a large amount of skew (3 min) after
about half an hour.
With your patch (tested against 2.6.16-rc3), there is no skew whether
NTP is running or not, and the system has been up 90 mins so far.
They two times appear to be the same.

Roger
