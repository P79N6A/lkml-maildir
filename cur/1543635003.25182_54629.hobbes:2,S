Same setup, actually -- I changed it to -3 and it seems nicer.
As for it going into 2.4, well, I'm not incredibly strongly for it, but
I do get a feeling that most of the distros (especially the ones famous
for patching their kernels beyond recognizabliity) will start jumping on
this particular wagon soon. Does the kernel want to be like debian
("Well, yeah, the releases are horribly out of date, but normal human
beings don't actually _use_ the releases") ?
P.S. Do not suppose from this message that I do not love debian
immensely. :)
