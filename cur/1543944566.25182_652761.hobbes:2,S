Well.. the question is "what are the semantics of IRQF_DISABLED?".
If it is "interrupts should be disabled while calling the ->action then
fine, 1) is good.
But that sounds fairly pointless - the handler can do local_irq_disable()
if it wants.  I guess IRQF_DISABLED was deswigned to hold off interrupts
for the entire duration of the hard IRQ - I don't really recall.  Alan
might though?
I'm pretty sure this came up within the last year, and it looks like we
decided to leave the code in the state which you see there.  I wonder why. 
How god is your googling?
