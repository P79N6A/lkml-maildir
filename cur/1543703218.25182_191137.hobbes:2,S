The very same? You mean if booted, wrote few kB's of data to disk, synced,
then pressed reset, the same three bytes were corrupted (set to zero) each
time after reboot? 
I can buy the faulty ram explanation for many symptoms, but it somehow in
this case it seems very unlikely. The box can be doing its thing (backing up
>20 workstations onto 6 ide disks) for weeks without ever corrupting
anything, and the when I power it down and up (after manually raidstopping
and umounting), three bytes get corrupted. (Well, sometimes few bytes in
addition to the three, but usually just three.)

The box does survive memtest, but you're right that doesn't prove anything.

This is i815.
