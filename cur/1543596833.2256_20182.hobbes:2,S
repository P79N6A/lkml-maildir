No: it's POSIX
If the client discovers that the cache is invalid, it clears it, and
refills the cache. We then start off at the next cookie after the last
read cookie. Test it on an ordinary filesystem and you'll see the
exact same behaviour. The act of creating or deleting files is *not*
supposed invalidate the readdir offset.
You are confusing the act of detecting whether or not the cache is
invalid with that of recovering after a cache invalidation. In the
former case we do have room for improvement: see for instance
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.6/linux-2.4.6-cto.dif
which strengthens the attribute checking on open().
Cheers,
