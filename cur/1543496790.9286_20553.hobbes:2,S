	One of the nice things about open-source code and such is that you
don't have to go reinventing the wheel in general, and I guess there is some
concern that if XFS has everything ext3 was planning to have, why develop
both?  Of course, it depends on the licenses, and if/when xfs actually shows
up and such.
	Also, this is somewhat of a distribution issue, it's kind of a
question of what is going to become the de-facto standard in the future,
which is actually something the distributions are probably going to decide,
and the high-end users who know enough to pick the fs they want. :)
