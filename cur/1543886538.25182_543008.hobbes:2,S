Looking at things in "top", I do end up occasionally seeing spikes where 
kacpid takes 17% of CPU time, and kacpi_notify takes a few percent too. 
But the machine works ok, and it doesn't seem to be horrible:
   64 ?        S<     0:15 [kacpid]
   65 ?        S<     0:08 [kacpi_notify]
so they've gotten 23 seconds of CPU time over the 37 minutes that laptop 
has been up now. That's arguably too much, but on the other hand, I did 
end up trying to stress it out by doing some 3D stuff while compiling the 
kernel and doing "git grep" over the kernel tree etc.
