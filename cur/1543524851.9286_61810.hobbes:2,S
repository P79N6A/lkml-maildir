Hi, Folks,
I am running the 2.2.14 kernel patched for the Ultra-66 IDE PCI card. 
I learned that I cannot boot from the drive attached via the Ultra-66 
interface, and am using a smaller drive attached via the logic board 
controller as my boot device.
I would like to eliminate the smaller HD. However, I have had no luck 
booting from a floppy I created via "make bzdisk" for the same kernel 
that happily runs of the larger Ultra-66 HD. Also, should I be able 
to use lilo and designate my floppy as the boot device (I tried this 
without any success, but I may have missed a step...)?
I'd appreciate any advice. Also, does the 2.3 kernel handle this better?
Thanks much, Igor
