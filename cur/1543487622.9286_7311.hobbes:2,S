After downloading and installing RealPlayer 5.0 a few days ago, I wasn't
able to get it to work either. It was late and I wanted to go to bed, so I
just put it aside and I haven't had a chance to mess with it since. Whenever
I tried to play a RealAudio file with it, I would hear a short blip of audio
then it would say "Error 01" and do nothing more. Checking on Real's website
says the Error 01 is an "unspecified error". Really helpful...
Is this the problem others are seeing?
