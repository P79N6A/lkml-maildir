Yes, this is normal. Especially on SMP, I get some transient reports,
probably caused by pointers hold in registers (even more visible on
ARM due to the bigger number of registers per CPU). Reporting a leak
only if it was seen at least once before greatly reduces the false
positives (this is configurable as well but I'll drop the
configuration option). Without this, you could see that, at every
scan, the reported pointers are different.
Some people testing kmemleak used to read the /debug/memleak file
periodically from a script and this wasn't noticeable. It would be
even better if, as you suggested, I schedule a periodic memory
scanning.
