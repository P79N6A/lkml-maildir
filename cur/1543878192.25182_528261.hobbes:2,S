Two points here:
* A lot of the users in the current kernel tree don't rely on the 
per-CPU qualities.  They just need multiple threads running.
* Even with per-CPU data structures and code, you don't necessarily have 
to keep a thread alive and running for each CPU.  Reap the ones that 
haven't been used in $TimeFrame, and add thread creation to the slow 
path that already exists in the bowels of schedule_work().
Or if some kernel hacker is really motivated, all workqueue users in the 
kernel would benefit from a "thread audit", looking at working 
conditions to decide if the new kthread APIs are more appropriate.

Regardless of how things are shuffled about internally, there will 
always be annoying overhead /somewhere/ when you have a metric ton of 
kernel threads.  I think that people should also be working on ways to 
make the kernel threads a bit more manageable for the average human.

I think there is a human downside.  For an admin you have to wade 
through a ton of processes on your machine, if you are attempting to 
evaluate the overall state of the machine.  Just google around for all 
the admins complaining about the explosion of kernel threads on 
production machines :)
