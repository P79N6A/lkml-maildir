The above is for ata2.00.

And, this for ata2.01.
PATA devices occupying the same channel literally share the cable, and 
the driver needs to configure PIO mode of both devices to the slowest of 
the two (PIO mode is always configured regardless of actual transfer 
mode).  UDMA mode doesn't save such restriction, so devices can be 
configured to its own maximum transfer mode.
libata, until recently, simply used the slowest max transfer mode for 
both PIO and UDMA modes (MWDMA too).  So, that's what's happening to 
you.  Your cdrom's max UDMA mode is UDMA/33, so libata is using it for 
both devices on the channel.  Recent kernels (2.6.19-rcX) don't have 
this restriction.  Give 2.6.19-rc5 a shot.
