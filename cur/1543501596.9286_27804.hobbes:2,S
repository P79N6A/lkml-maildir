1. Before you post a patch, you should remove the files that are generated
   by the build process (.version,.depend,include/linux/version.h) or
   it won't apply cleanly.
2. Your API seems to assume that all processors in an SMP system are
   identical.  Hardly very flexible.
3. Based on Linus's comments about adding sysconf/pathconf/fpathconf
   to the kernel, I'd be amazed if he accepted this patch.  For good
   reason, too - there are not many programs that need to dig in
   /proc/cpuinfo and it's not THAT hard.  This is just 100% kernel
   bloat.  (OTOH, I'd still like to see {sys,{f,}path}conf helpers
   in the kernel since the current "do-it-in-libc" method doesn't get
   all the info it needs to work correctly currently... but I digress)
   If you think parsing /proc/cpuinfo is too hard to do in each program,
   look into adding that functionality to libproc.
