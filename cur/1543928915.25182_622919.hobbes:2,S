"Mainstream" 32-bit-x86, the affected boxes are running Intel Xeons (P4)
at 2.66 or 2.8 GHz. 
In between, I've ruled out that the static assignment isn't
source of the problem.  And due to some manually made "make clean" which 
didn't clean enough, I've also pointed out the wrong patch - sorry,
Fujita, definitely the right one which breaks my boxes is the dpt_i2o patch 
from 2.6.23-rc2 to 2.6.23-rc3 (7 kb in Size) from Matthew Wilcox.
commit 55d9fcf57ba5ec427544fca7abc335cf3da78160

    [SCSI] dpt_i2o: convert to SCSI hotplug model
     - Delete refereces to HOSTS_C
     - Switch to module_init/module_exit instead of detect/release
     - Don't pass around the host template and rename it to
       adpt_template
     - Switch from scsi_register/scsi_unregister to scsi_host_alloc,
       scsi_add_host, scsi_scan_host and scsi_host_put.

"Definitely" as in
-applied the diff-patch onto 2.6.23.1 with a dpt_i2o from 2.6.23-rc1
 to verify that booting failes.
-Recompiled a clean unpacked 2.6.23-rc2 to verify that the driver
 from -rc2 still works.
-Recompiled a clean unpacked 2.6.23-rc3 to verify that the driver
 from -rc3 breaks booting on my boxes.
So sorry for mispointing the bug to you, it's an issue for Matthew.
