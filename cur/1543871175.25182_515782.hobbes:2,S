Well, apart from the obvious question to which nobody actually knows the 
answer, (how many people run old user space that required 
CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO), what do you think of reversing the boot option?
vdso=enabled (default - turn on VDSO on normal boots)
vdso=disabled (turn off VDSO unconditionally)
[vdso=compat] (default for COMPAT_VDSO - keep VDSO only when mapped at 
compat location.  Note the option is not required to be implemented 
because it is logically implied from vdso=enabled && COMPAT_VDSO and the 
default boot behavior)
vdso=force (keep VDSO even when moved to a new location and COMPAT_VDSO 
is enabled).
In our case, installing VMware tools in the guest would then detect if 
userspace supports VDSO or if it requires COMPAT_VDSO and would then set 
boot parameters for the kernel appropriately.  And the native boot and 
kvm paravirt-ops boot are completely unaffected.
