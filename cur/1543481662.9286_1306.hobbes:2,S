doesn't matter!  even with correct System.map file I get only empty WCHAN fields
with 2.2.0-final too:
	# ps lp 1
	 FLAGS   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   SIZE   RSS WCHAN       STA TTY TIME COMMAND
	   100     0     1     0   0   0    824    64             S   ?   0:04 init [2]     
	                                              ^^^^^^^
with strace clearly showing that it's using the correct map:
	open("/boot/System.map-2.2.0-final", O_RDONLY) = 3
