The purpose of LSM is to allow different security models to be
implemented.  IMHO, a security model here meaning a complete or otherwise
significantly enhancing system-wide framework, such as SELinux.
I don't think LSM is a suitable framework for upstream merging of trivial
or experimental access control enhancements.  They should either be made
part of the core kernel under LSM control or incorporated directly into an
existing LSM.
One of the reasons I would put forward for this is that it can be
dangerous to allow the user to arbitrarily compose security modules.
Also, from an architectural point of view, it's better to think about
security models at a high level with broadly defined components (e.g.  
"DAC" and "MAC"), not as a collection of miscellaneous features.
In the case of this code, I would suggest integrating it into the core
kernel, and providing an LSM hook to allow other LSMs to mediate it.
As an example, see the vm_enough_memory hook.
