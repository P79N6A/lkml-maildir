It doesn't penalize the architectures which do the right thing already.
If this weren't i386 we were talking about...
But adding a bizarro "pre-prepare" notifier verged on nonsensical 8(.  I
prefer an explicit "init_timers_early()" call as a workaround; I'll code
that up and test tomorrow, when I'm back in the office with an SMP box
to test.
I'm also not clear on why we need to enable interrupts around
calibrate_delay() on secondary processors, but I'll try that too and
find out 8)
Thanks,
Rusty.
