And btw, in some cases the inlining used to be a correcness issue, so no,
just making it be "static inline" doesn't necessarily fix the basic issue. 
Again, whether that is necessarily true today is not something I'm ready 
to guarantee one way or the other, so this is just an observation that 
things can be a lot more subtle than you seem to assume.
