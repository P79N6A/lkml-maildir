Yes, I did that with kernel 2.2.1 and tried to mount the disk, but
it dint work. I used "mount -t ufs -ufstype=44bsd ...."
The point here is: How do utilities like mount or fdisk know that
the partition map support has been compiled or no? Even fdisk
behaves shadily, saying there is a mismatch between the logical
and physical endings of the disk. Obviously it is a problem with
recognising the partition table here.
Is there any other command, or option passed to mount which makes
it incorporate the Disklabel support, or is this achieved
inherently?
Any pointers to information on this would be welcome. I am going
through drivers/block/genhd.c , in which the code for the
Solaris/BSD disklabels is found. 
TIA,
Raj
