Didn't you noticed any of the reports about very bad numbers for latency since 
Ingo's latest 2.4.17-K3 version?
Even Alan's tree show the same (latest I've checked was 2.4.19-pre2-ac2).
We do need some words from Ingo first.
He haven't answered my posts since February ;-(
But yaybe he didn't got them 'cause I send them to mingo@elte.hu ???
If you run without O(1) latency is like before.
You'll get better numbers with preemption+lock-break (ongoing merge of 
Andrew's lowlatency patches).
But I see some kernel hangs with preemption on UP.
It happens only during "make bzlilo" (the linking stage). Robert?
Apart from that it works well.
