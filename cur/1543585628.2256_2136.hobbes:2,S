Hi,
I'm experiencing problems with an rtl8029-nic. The computer acts as a
multicast-client receiving a disk-image from a server. That transfer went
fine during the first 1.5 gb and then the machine stopped responding.
I tried to ping it, but got no answer. On the machine i see that the
error-packets (/sbin/ifconfig) grow very fast, but the machine cannot
send or receive anymore.  The arp-table contains 00:00:.. for all 
hw-addresses.  Dmesg shows: 
eth0: bogus packet size: 65360, status=0x0 nxpg=0x0
(repeated for 100+ times)
The machine runs kernel 2.4.2 without module-support. All other participating 
computers have exactly the same hardware and software (they were all cloned 
with ghost).  If i restart the program, everything goes fine for some 
minutes and then another computer crashes with exactly the same symptoms.
When i restart the network-configuration, everything seems to work again.
Any help would be appreciated !
Kindly regards,
Michael Devogelaere.
