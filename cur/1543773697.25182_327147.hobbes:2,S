Humpf. I agree it seemed to get a bit further than that, but I kicked off
a new test before I went to bed, and it does seem to work w/o the sched
patches:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mbligh/abat/regression_matrix.html
see the "moe" column, comparing:
2.6.12-mm1
+apw_pci_assign_unass
+nosched_2.6.12-mm1
vs
2.6.12-mm1
+apw_pci_assign_unass
rows ?
I can still do initcall debug if you want. Or I guess it's binary chop
search amongst sched patches (or at least the ones that are new in 
this -mm ?)
