Ok, you are proposing throwing out all the label handling that SELinux 
does, including any caching. forgive me if I agree with the SELinux people 
that this is a very bad idea.

I thought the userspace component was what you were proposing instead of 
doing the regex matching in the kernel. if this isn't it what exactly are 
you proposing?
you don't want the regex matching in the kernel.
you don't want a userspace component to do the regex matching when files 
are created or renamed.
how exactly do you propose to figure out what should happen to a file when 
it is created or it (or a parent directory) is renamed?
AA policies are defined in terms of regex expressions. you say that this 
should be able to be done on top of SELinux somehow without changing the 
policies. so somewhere, something needs to interpret the regex to see if 
it matches the path. this needs to be either kernel code or userspace 
code. you have ruled out kernel code and are now claiming that userspace 
isn't needed.
