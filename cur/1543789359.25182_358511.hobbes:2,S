Two problems:
 - this is ugly as hell
   First, you change SCSI_SATA to be boolean, then you change the 
   depends-on to be "if". Which makes no sense. Once SCSI_SATA is a 
   boolean, then the "depends on" works fine, since SCSI_SATA can no 
   longer be "m" anyway (ie your comment about "dep_mbool" doesn't make 
   sense).
   Second, if you want "dep_mbool", then you can have dep_mbool in Kconfig 
   too. Just do
	depends on (XYZ != n)
   which gets you what you want (ie if XYZ is "m", then the inequality 
   will be "y")
   So you might as well have just done something like
	 config SCSI_SATA
	-       tristate "Serial ATA (SATA) support"
	-       depends on SCSI
	+       bool "Serial ATA (SATA) support"
	+       depends on SCSI != n
   and then just added SCSI to the "depends on" lines to get the "m" 
   config. No "if" needed.
 - anything that depends on a module had better only be _inside_ that 
   module. Ie the "dep_mbool" kind of behaviour should _not_ affect 
   anything outside the module. The reason? Maybe you build the module 
   _later_, and maybe you don't ever load it.
   So it appears that your dependence on quirk_intel_ide_combined() is 
   fundamentally broken for the "m" case _anyway_.
Anyway, the second thing means that the whole configuration is somewhat 
broken, but on the whole, why not this _much_ more trivial patch?
It's still broken, exactly because it depends on the modules being defined 
when compiling the whole kernel, but hey, we probably have other cases 
like that.
My suggestion being that we should make it unconditional, but maybe that 
breaks the case where we don't actually load the SATA module?
