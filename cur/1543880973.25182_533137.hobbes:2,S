Something like that would have made it a lot more obvious
why my Matrox PCIe x1 video card will not work in my Dell
9150, while a PCI video card does work.
The PCI video card directly sits on the bus, and gets its
resources assigned by the BIOS.
The PCIe video card turned out to be a PCIe to AGP bridge,
and the BIOS did not assign the needed PCI resources, making
the system crash when I started X.
X seemed to have some trouble reading the ROM, too...
