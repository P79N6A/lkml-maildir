Unfortunately, Windoze supports this configuration, and that's enough
for most hardware designers.  This is also an issue with the joystick
ports on many PCI sound cards.  We're not in a position to get up on the
soap box and decree this hardware "a bag of shit" though, yet.
PS.  I have run into this issue before with joystick ports on many PCI
sound cards.  The only one that I found that did it right (seperate PCI
function for the game port) was the SBLive.
