lkcd uses it too for its kernel crash dump. I suspect it wouldn't be that
hard to change.

I think yes - keeping two kinds of iovectors for IO (kiovecs and BIOs) seems 
to be redundant.
kiovecs never fulfilled their original promise of a universal zero copy
container (e.g. they were too heavy weight for networking) so it's probably
best to remove them as a failed experiment.
