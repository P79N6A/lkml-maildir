Hi!
I have firewalling enabled just in case. And after I upgraded to
2.2.11pre4, I get
   eth0 PROTO=17 ... L=1500 S=0x00 I=3724 F=0x60B9 T=255
after I try to list a long directory from solaris2.5.1 nfs server. I
uncommented the line printk("Suspect short first packet") in ip_fw.c, and
this is really printed. So I guess NFS server sends too long UDP packets
and they get fragmented. But before it worked with no problem.
So I think the rule of short packet needs to be corrected. Unfortunately i
don't know how.
The machine is alpha pc164.
   Alexander.
