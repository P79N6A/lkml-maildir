Hi,
I did another try, after exiting X by Ctrl + Alt +
Backspace or whatever I use to exit X,  still not see
the console; I press Alt + F1 and the console appeared
as normal. No X process in running (run pstree )  ;
now I try to run X again and can X can not run, it
says : No init screen found, and something about it
can not initilize dri  (yes I compiled dri built into
the kenel, not as module). After that I got the vc ;
still run other command as normal. When I run
dmesg|less   I found an OOPS which I sent as an
attachment below.
If anything I can do to debug, pls let me know.
