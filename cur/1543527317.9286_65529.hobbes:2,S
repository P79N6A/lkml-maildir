This is an artifact of the pathname resolution scheme differences
between small memory oriented Unix and large memory oriented Linux.
In the Unix namei and vnode schemes only information required to get
the next component looked up is retained at each step. When the
lookup is complete you have the information about the terminal object,
and that's it. In the Linux scheme, the entire path is retained. The
getcwd system call is trivial in Linux. It would be very difficult
on a Unix scheme.
In the Unix scheme getcwd is a set of directory lookups. On Linux,
it's a simple fetch of a process attribute. From the viewpoint of
a security policy, either is satisfactory.
As an aside, the Linux scheme make security audit much easier. I
like it.
