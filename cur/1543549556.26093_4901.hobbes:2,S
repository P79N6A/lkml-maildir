In running xawtv i stumbled upon a very interesting message
shmget: No space left on device
yet df -m shows
shm                       8192       108      8084   2% /var/shm
I'm not sure what's going on here,  /var/shm shows a BUNCH of files in
it.. and none of my partitions are even close to being full according to
df -m also.   any hints would be helpful
