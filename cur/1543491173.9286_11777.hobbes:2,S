To linux-kernel, I've chatted with Alan about this elsewhere. He still 
finds the license repugnant, but I assure you all that I am utterly about 
the user having access to the source of everything they use. I didn't put 
a svga paint program in cLIeNUX for that reason.
Call me anything but closed source.
