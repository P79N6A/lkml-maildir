We'll get there ;) I'm waiting for a suitable time to merge
add-config_headers_check-option-to-automatically-run-make-headers_check.patch,
which will cause all `make allmodconfig' testers to automatically run `make

But I don't think the time is right yet - a little later, when things have
settled down and when it all works nicely on multiple architectures.
