Well, i'm pretty sure it is, though I didn't want to post a patch
affecting what currently work, I prefer letting you or other
x86 addicts figure that out :)
In the case of ide_inswp though, there is a real problem as there
is no equivalent of the "p" functions on non-x86 anyway, and you
can't easily reproduce the "insw" semantics with {in,out}{w,l}
without adding useless double-byteswap on BE. But on the other
hand, the IDE layer doesn't use ide_inswp() callback, and the
case where "p" functions are used is currently broken on BE
as well (see ide_{input,output}_data when drive->slow is true).
I suggest that you get this patch in asap (eventually swithing
to insw unconditionally in ide_insw) so at least 2.5 works again
properly on BE, further cleanup of the iops is pending, I'm waiting
for Alan own experiments before I push again my own that remove
all "p" iops and all of the {IN,OUT}{BYTE,WORD,LONG} macros.
Ben.
