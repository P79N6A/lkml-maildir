Subject: PCI memory allocation bug with CONFIG_HIGHMEM

In arch/i386/kernel/setup.c we have:
	/* Tell the PCI layer not to allocate too close to the RAM area.. */
	low_mem_size = ((max_low_pfn << PAGE_SHIFT) + 0xfffff) & ~0xfffff;
	if (low_mem_size > pci_mem_start)
		pci_mem_start = low_mem_size;
which is meant to round up pci_mem_start to the nearest 1 MB boundary
past the top of physical RAM.  However this does not consider highmem.
Should this just be using max_pfn rather than max_low_pfn?
(I have a report of this failing on a laptop with a highmem kernel,
causing a PCI memory resource to be allocated on top of a RAM area)
