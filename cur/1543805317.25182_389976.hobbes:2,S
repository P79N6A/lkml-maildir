I would have no problems if you weren't spreading your misguided
information disguised as real info. I've had thousands of useful
conversations on lkml in the past many years, but I fail to remember
just one with you involved (whether I participated or not).
I'll refrain from writing further mails in this thread, unless you
actually "find some time" to back up your claims with real data.
