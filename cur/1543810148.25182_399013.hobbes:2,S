...and that requires defining 'works'.
If we define it as "writes an image of some part of ram to a swap partition 
that can be and does normally get restored on the next boot", then yes, we 
have a working version in the existing vanilla kernel. If however you start 
talking about multiple swap partitions or swap files or ordinary files, about 
reliability or the ability to tune it to fit your system and preferences, 
about the responsiveness of the system post resume or the security of the 
image (IIRC, encryption support has just been removed from swsusp), about the 
ability to get help when you run into trouble or documentation, swsusp 
becomes less of a candidate for 'works'.
Regards,
Nigel
