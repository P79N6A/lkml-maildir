Oh, sorry for misunderstanding.
In our internal testcase on 8-CPU 8Gb RAM machine with 4gb split kernel
w/o this patch mount/umount test longs in many-many (>10) times longer.
Moreover, during the test machine is very slow (due to lock_kernel)
and typing simple commands takes up to 30 seconds or so.
I think such a long hangs are due to number of umounts executed
subsequently. But ofcourse it's not numbers, just for you to know where
the patch comes from :)
