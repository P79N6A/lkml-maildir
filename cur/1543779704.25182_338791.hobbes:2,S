No, that is bogus. We have shutdown() already for that and it used to be
implemented at least by IDE.
You are just blindly "dropping" the device_suspend() call in there
without thinking. There is a lot of differences between suspend and
shutdown, you can't "just do that". In addition to the number of drivers
with broken suspend of course, causing many boxes to not shutdown
anymore (and not only PPCs)
Andrew, please back that off before 2.6.13. I'll try to send a patch if
you want later today if I find some time with a kernel source at hand.
Ben.
