Is this thread-safe?  What if two different bits are set at the same
time from two different threads?  It seems that both calls could get
the same result from hipz_h_query_port(), and then the second call to
hipz_h_modify_port() would overwrite the first call.
You could look at the implementation in mthca to see the locking I
used there.
