Additional work went in, thus additional copyrights were added.

In a purely open development environment, even personal developer trees 
are made public.  That's the way we _want_ development to occur.  Out in 
public, with a full audit trail.
Your implied ideal scenario is tantamount to guaranteeing that mistakes 
are never committed to a public repository anywhere.  Mistakes will 
happen.  Even legal mistakes.  In public.

What you are seeing is an example of mistakes that were caught in 
review, and corrected.
That's how any scalable review process works...  the developer reviews 
his own work.  the team reviews the developer's work.  the maintainer 
reviews the team's work.  the next maintainer reviews.  and so on, to 
the top.
