No, we get another reference on the passed in dev argument (in this
failing case, it is for an FC's rport), not its children (scsi_target)
that we want to iterate over.
If all children (scsi_targets) are removed, then the put in
scsi_remove_target() would (or could) set the rport refcount to zero and
it would be deleted. But the scsi_target would already be gone.
Cases that are not affected are passed a scsi_target:
scsi_is_target_device(dev) is true and we won't even call
device_for_each_child().
Adding another get/put in __remove_child() does *not* help either, as it
is the code within device_for_each_child() that needs another get/put of
the kref instead of a get/put on the klist (well its n_ref); and if you do
that, I don't see how the locking can be done correctly.
I thought we had some semaphores in scsi to protect calls to
scsi_remove_target(), but I only see those for scsi_device scan/removal
(the shost->scan_mutex).
It looks like scsi should not allow removal and additions to happen at the
same time on any scsi_target (and adding up/down on shost->scan_mutex
won't fix this problem).
