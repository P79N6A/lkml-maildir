It boots, but it's crap. It has not the required Windtunnel
support built in (kernel too old), so the fans go crazy.
(And a G5 with fans going crazy is _really_ annoying).
But installing YDL 4.1 is good to bootstrap another distribution
plus kernel from it.
I first installed YDL 4.1 and (somehow, don't remember all the
dirty details) bootstrapped a Ubuntu on it. After that I deleted
the YDL partition again and made it my /home partition.
