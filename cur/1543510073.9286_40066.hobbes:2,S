	Hi!
	This is probably more of a gcc question than a linux kernel one (sorry
for that).
	If one would use 2 or more C files to create a module, how would he
link it afterwards?
	I've tried using ld as
		ld -o output.o -r objFile1.o objFile2.o objFile3.o (...)
	but it doesn't quite do the job... as the kernel symbols are lost then
(such as memcpy).
	Also, I believe that starting with the pentium-pro the processor has
the ability to perform task switching by hardware, witch is probably faster
than by software. As anyone tried this (if it's possible)?
	And a question about the internal apic (starting from the pentium, but
disable on most pentium MB. Always enable on p6 boards). Is it use by the
kernel (I think not)?
		Thx for any help.
