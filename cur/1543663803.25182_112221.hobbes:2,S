Albert, do you realize the simple fact that the procps enhancements we did
change absolutely nothing for the 'ps m' case? All thread PIDs are still
scanned and sorted.
And mind you, thread-directories do not change much in this area - the
PIDs within the thread-directory will still be largely unsorted, and it
will not make the reading & sorting of 20K threads any faster.

so i'm in full agreement with Linus. And here's an email of mine from more 
than 7 months ago:

so in fact _i_ came up with this whole issue 7 months ago. I just dont
share many of _your_ largely bogus arguments that seem to miss the point.  
Can we finally stop this storm in a teapot?
