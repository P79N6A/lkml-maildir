Just wanted to report that it seems w/ 2.6.18-rc6 the fix has made it
in, and my system now reports that there is a SoundByLayout alsa device.
However...  ;)
It seems the new device doesn't have any volume control. I know the old
toonie driver used some form of softvol support, but "it just worked",
where as now I have no control over my system's audio volume.
While not the most terrible of regressions, its a bit irritating (waking
to loud mail notifications, specifically :). Is this something that I
have to wait for an alsa userland update to fix, or is the new kernel
driver just not fully functional yet?
thanks
