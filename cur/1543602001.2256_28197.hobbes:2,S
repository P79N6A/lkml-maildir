vfs_symlink() returns an integer, not dentry.

No, it doesn't.  vfs_create() returns 0 in case of success and small negative
number in case of error.  Neither has any relation to inode numbers.
dentry you've passed to it is modified - it gets non-NULL ->d_inode _if_
operation succeeded.  Which is not guaranteed - depends on kind of filesystem,
length of symlink body, permissions, etc.
So unless you tell what you are passing to vfs_symlink(), what does it
return, etc. - there's nothing anyone could do.  We might be smart, by
I'm not aware of anybody here being telepathic.
