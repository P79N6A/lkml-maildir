That's in -aa kernels, is correct and is needed.

hmm.  Someone seems to have renamed my nuke-buffers patch ;)
My main concern is that this was a real quickie; it does a very
aggressive takedown of buffer_heads.  Andrea's kernels contain a
patch which takes a very different approach.  See
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.20pre8aa2/05_vm_16_active_free_zone_bhs-1
I don't think anyone has tried that patch in isolation though...
If nuke-buffers passes testing and doesn't impact performance then
fine.  A more cautious approach would be to use the active_free_zone_bhs
patch.  If that proves inadequate then add in the "read" part of nuke-buffers.
That means dropping the fs/buffer.c part.
