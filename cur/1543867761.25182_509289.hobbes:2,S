It is not need to call kick_iocb()
for generic_file_aio_write() calling.
It is recalled without any wakeup waiting:
        for (;;) {
                ret = filp->f_op->aio_write(&kiocb, &iov, 1,
kiocb.ki_pos);
                if (ret != -EIOCBRETRY)
                        break;
                wait_on_retry_sync_kiocb(&kiocb);
        }
Note: wait_on_retry_sync_kiocb() does not wait.
That is for dio. For aio iocb generic_file_aio_write() call
is required from ki_run_list while next io_submit or
read_events() is called.
So when an IO hang may happen?
>> It overwrites -EIOCBQUEUED
Do you mean that there is one more kernel bug which
overwrites -EIOCBQUEUED by any errno or number of bytes and this
new value is returned to caller as an IO result
while IO is not finished yet.
The proposed patch does not crate this bug if any.
It actually fixes a kernel panic bag when iocb.users count becomes
incorrect. The bag " Kernel BUG at fs/aio.c:509" is there because
aio_run_iocb() have not a chance to differ real EIO and
EIO which is actually means EAGAYN or EIOCBRETRY.
I'me sure the patch changes source code in correct direction:
to differentiate that two kinds of EIOs.

I have read. But compiler has not: it did not create an object code for
* If ki_retry returns -EIOCBRETRY ...

One of reference count iocb.users confusion is deleted by the patch.
I'm not sure that there is other bag.
At least I have not see IO hang while testing.
It is interesting that I've not seen any EIOCBQUEUED returned
to aio_run_iocb() during 5 hours aiostress running.
Does it mean that EIOCBQUEUED is always reset and never returned?

Only if kick_iocb() is called.  It won't be called if i_i_p2_r() was  
the only thing to return -EIOCBRETRY.

Not by fs/aio.c, but *by the place that originated -EIOCBQUEUED*.   
Later.  After IO has completed.  see fs/direct-io.c:dio_bio_end_aio().
This is what -EIOCBQUEUED means!  It's a promise to call aio_complete 
() in the future.
Have you read the giant comment over the definition of struct kiocb  
in include/linux/aio.h?

Sorry, I don't understand what you're trying to ask here.
