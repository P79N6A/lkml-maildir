No, in looking at that package, I do not see any kernel modules, just
userspace programs.  They must be using the usbfs interface to the
kernel from userspace, a perfict example of how a vendor can control USB
device from userspace, without needing a kernel driver :)
So it should continue to work just fine.

Both sane and cups are userspace programs, using usbfs and the kernel
usblp driver respectively, and should not see anything change at all.

You would be seeing some warnings in the kernel log for the past 2 years
when using these products, about how the symbols were going to be
changed in the future.  If not, you are fine.
