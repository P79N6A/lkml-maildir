Shows up correctly here. Random guess is that your MUA treats tabs like
spaces when it sees format=flowed. The lines between the different ranks
weren't empty but had a single tab. And for whatever reason (I don't see
any trailing spaces), Arjan's mail had a format=flowed header.
AFAIK, only SPACE CRLF is valid for line-continuation with
format=flowed, not TAB CRLF.  So the above formatting would be the
result of a pointless format=flowed header meeting a MUA that was too
eager searching for line continuations.
