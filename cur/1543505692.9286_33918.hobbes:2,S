OK, that's indeed useful to know, thanks.
In your opinion, should there be a guarantee that accesses initiated
by readl/writel/etc. will not be reordered?
Alternatively, should device driver writers be required to put in an
explicit statement (mb() or something similar) when they use
readl/writel/etc. and want to prevent the accesses being reordered?
Thanks,
Paul.
