I used to have a test case that would reproduce the problem some what
consistently. But with invalidate_range() introduction and Jan Kara's
re-write of journal commit handling, I can't reproduce the problem
anymore. So I gave up fixing the problem which I can't reproduce.
If anyone has a testcase - I can take a look at the problem again.
Thanks,
