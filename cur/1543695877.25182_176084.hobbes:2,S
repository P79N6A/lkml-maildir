There's no need.  The output from that diagnostic is definitive -- this 
isn't a USB problem.  It's got to be a problem higher up, maybe in the 
SCSI layer but more likely in the block layer or the file system code.

The line where it says sg_address = 00000000 indicates that something has
asked us to read data from the device and store it at a virtual address
that isn't mapped to memory!  You can see the same thing in the last line,
where ptr = 00000000.  No wonder you get an oops.
This bug should be reassigned, but I don't know to whom.  Maybe someone on 
the linux-kernel mailing list can help.
