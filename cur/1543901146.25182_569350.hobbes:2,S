but per stable-abi-nonsense the internal structure of the kernel's pages 
data isn't an abi. so instead of figuring this out by pokeing around in 
the memory of the old kernel and deciding what should be saved and what 
shouldn't, the old kernel (which understands the memory structure) should 
create a simple map of what should be backed up (either a bitmap or an 
extent-style map, depending on how many holes there are expected to be) 
and then provide that map to the new kernel. the new kernel (or more 
precisely it's userspace) reads the pages it's told to read and writes 
them somewhere.

I'll look through this file, but the format of this is an abi/api to the 
userspace and should be documented outside of the code.
