No, it may be e.g. a Rx/Tx-register in a standard UART chip, which is
memory-mapped at some address. Actually reading and writing the same
address then would get different registers in the hardware. Reading
two times may get different values.
You would actually access this register through a "volatile char *" 
but that's not a significant difference to the concept of "volatile", 
so I see above as a simple example (and not as an optimizer-guru's 
discussion subject "can we optimize just this volatile expression in 
that context").

Nope, this existed before as jtv@xs4all.nl explained correctly.
