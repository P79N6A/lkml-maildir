Swap arguments to MODULE_INFO, but yes, other than the extra "(Maintained 
by)" that's what was originally submitted:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/4/170
If you're going to be using a "maintainer" tag anyway as both that and yours 
above does, the "(Maintained by)" becomes superfluous, so we're back at the 
original.
I must say I'm not particularly sure either why reusing MODULE_AUTHOR would 
be better if MODULE_AUTHOR also remains (as Alan Cox pointed out might be 
desirable for legal reasons if nothing else). As fas as I'm aware, the other 
trivial patch I posted to init-module-tools:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/4/171
is all that's needed to make it useful.
But, I also really only care about being able to add MODULE_MAINTAINER() to 
some drivers that have outlived their authors and from that viewpoint there 
is no difference, so if Rusty feels this is better, so be it.
Andrew, mind if I submit this to you?

Provide MODULE_MAINTAINER() as a convenient place to stick a name and email 
address both for drivers having multiple (current and non-current) authors 
and for when someone who wants to maintain a driver isn't so much an author.
