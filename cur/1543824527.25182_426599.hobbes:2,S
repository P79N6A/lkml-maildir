While licensing is obviously entirely up to you (as the author), I 
wouldn't worry too much about using the GPL / copyleft for your software 
in this case. I know there are a lot of BSD developers that would be happy 
to replace every line of GPL-licensed code with BSD-licensed code, but 
given that the BSD license has around 5% penetration versus 
some-number-around-80% for the GPL, I think GPL code in a BSD system is 
kind of a reality at this point. It might be more of a concern to me (in my work) if I 
thought that the GPL was restrictive.
Remember that the GPL doesn't even apply to the end-user until they want 
to make a copy of your original or their derivitive work. Also remember 
that GNOME and KDE are both under (L)GPL licensing.
