Ok, I have to get this patched video driver to work, means recompiling
debian/sid package with this fix.
For usb, no idea, but I can live with /etc/init.d/hotplug stop ; sleep ;
... start.

And orinoco from cvs also works.
Thanks a lot and best wishes

TYNE and WEAR (nouns)
The 'Tyne' is the small priceless or vital object accidentally dropped
on the floor (e.g. diamond tie clip, contact lens) and the 'wear' is
the large immovable object (e.g. Welsh dresser, car-crusher) that it
shelters under.
