Hello,
Lot of people would like to know their data in secure place, and the
frequent usage of compression softwares could be time-consuming and boring
sometime.
Idea:
extend the current file-system with an optional plug-in system, which allows
for file-system level encryption instead of file-level. This could be used
transparently for applications or even for file-system drivers.  This
doesn't mean an encrypted file-system, but a transparent encryption of a
media instead.
Advantages:
#1: optional security level for every data, without user interaction.
#2: if this idea is used e.g. for portable media (like cdrom), your backup
could be in safe also.
#3: (almost;)) everybody could create own security plugin for their data,
and not have to trust on the designers of a secure file systems.
I suspect that this idea may appeared in the past:(, but I haven't heard
about it;).
So, what do you think about this? Is Linux kernel enough flexible to do
this? What changes are necessary to do such a thing? Is there any other way,
to have own security for file-systems or portable medias? Is this
implementation could be used in the US?
Best regards,
Tamas Nagy
