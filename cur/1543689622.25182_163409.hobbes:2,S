Seems like I got the reason for X not starting:
pseudo terminals can't be acquired and only two consoles are running.
-> X11 can't get console Vt7
-> pppd doesn't work either
This definitely worked with -mm5.
I tried on both Thinkpad R40 2722 and a Elitegroup MB+ Athlon XP1800
System with Debian SID. I didn't use devfs.
