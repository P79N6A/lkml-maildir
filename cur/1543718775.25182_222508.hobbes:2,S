The IA/64 backtrace with all the cruft removed looks as follows:
0xa000000100149ac0 reap_timer_fnc+0x100
0xa0000001000f4d70 run_timer_softirq+0x2d0
0xa0000001000e9440 __do_softirq+0x200
0xa0000001000e94e0 do_softirq+0x80
0xa000000100017f50 ia64_handle_irq+0x190
The system is running mostly AIM7, but I've seen holdoffs > 30 usec with
virtually no load on the system.
Which uncomfortable solutions (which could relate to this case) have been
investigated?
