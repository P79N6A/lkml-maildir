Is MQ based on the Davide Libenzi scheduler? 
(a version of Davide's scheduler is in the -aa tree).

tbench 192 is an anomaly test too.  AIM looks like a nice
"mixed" bench.  Do you have any scripts for it?  I'd like 
to use AIM too.
A side effect of O(1) in ac2 and jam6 on the 4 way box is a decrease 
in pipe bandwidth and an increase in pipe latency measured by lmbench:
kernel                    Pipe bandwidth in MB/s - bigger is better
