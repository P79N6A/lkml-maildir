Obviously two ways of looking at things. Linus wants it to work the same
all the time, I want it to work the same on all POSIX systems, and if we
add (or find) a kernel change which isn't POSIX, and doing things in the
POSIX manner breaks the binary, the error is in the program. I have no
problem with bits to make little parts of Linux behave in a POSIX manner,
but I would like one POSIX bit which sets the most compliant behaviour
available.
I shouldn't have to recompile every time another instance of POSIX
behaviour is added, and I fail to see that bits are so precious that there
couldn't be one POSIX bit in addition to the bits allowing a monmgrel
hybred of POSIX and non-POSIX behaviour.
if (environ & OPTION_POSIX_FOO) { standard... } else { non-standard }
  is no faster than 
if (environ & (OPTION_POSIX | OPTION_POSIX_FOO)) ...
  and I fail to see why Linus is fighting the idea so hard. If correct
behaviour breaks my portable program it wasn't portable and the program is
in error. I set the bit, I have no complaint.
