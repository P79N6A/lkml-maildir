As a matter of fact this is most certainly kernel-source-2.4.27 from 
Debian. This problem was recently fixed (as discussed in the mini-thread 
about how CML1 blows chunks.)
For what it's worth to Google, kernel-tree-2.4.27-4 has just hit 
unstable (will reach mirrors by tomorrow) and should have fixed this 
problem.
Sorry for the noise caused to LKML.
