Yes, you are missing something here. The entire point is that devfs is
not getting into the kernel in its current form. There has been really
strong opposition from some very high-ranking kernel developers. It is
pointless to continue the argument using the existing devfs. It simply
is Not Going To Happen. There's no point fighting that.
This is why I suggested losing the devfs FILESYSTEM but retaining what
is devfs's INTENTION. Use the existing devfsd to maintain nodes on the
disk. Most of the benefits are kept. Some problems are addressed.

You're still missing something. The post you responded to doesn't talk
about a filesystem called devfs at all. The very first sentence of the
post you responded to made this explicitly clear.
