And Zwane Mwaikambo answered and asked:
    Do these keys correspond to the correct ones on your keyboards? I still
    have to come across a keyboard which has these keys but different
    scancodes. But i think i'm beating a dead horse ;)
My collection of scancode data can be found at

In particular you see at
	
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-1.html#ss1.9
that having power saving keys with scancodes e0 followed by 5e/5f/63
is a Microsoft standard. Every modern keyboard that has power saving keys
has them with these scancodes.
So, I have no real objections against your patch.
(On the other hand, this is an area that is perhaps best regarded as
frozen. Changes just to avoid the trouble of a setkeycodes call
should perhaps be postponed.)
