Believe it or not, there are a lot of routers nowadays that can do NAT.
And even for very basic NAT, you have to recompute the TCP checksum, which
means that you mangle data within the packet. Even worse, some of them are
able to NAT complex protocols such as FTP and for this, they need to mangle
the application payload. OK, this should not be the router's job, but it's
often the best placed to do the job, and there is customer demand for this.
