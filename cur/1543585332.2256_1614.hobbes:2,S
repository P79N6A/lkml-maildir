no, it's quite odd.  hdparm -t cannot be effected by the filesystem
that lives in the partition, since hdparm is doing reads that don't
go through the filesystem.  hmm, I wonder if that's it: if you mount
the FS that's in hda1, it might change the block driver configuration
(changing the blocksize, for instance).  that would effect hdparm,
even though its reads don't go through the FS.
prediction: if you comment out the hda1 line in fstab, and reboot,
so that vfat never gets mounted on that partition, I predict that 
hdparm will show >30.19 MB/s on it.
