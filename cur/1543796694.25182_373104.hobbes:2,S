ohh dear, it seems that, unlike kfree, put_page doesn't like 'NULL' as
an argument.
You can try

@@ -36,6 +36,8 @@ int page_cluster;
 
 void put_page(struct page *page)
 {
+	if (unlikely(page==NULL))
+		return;
 	if (unlikely(PageCompound(page))) {
 		page = (struct page *)page_private(page);
 		if (put_page_testzero(page)) {

for now.  If Andrew doesn't like that I'll make the code in raid1
more careful (maybe I'll define put_page_unless_null :-)
Thanks for the testing and the report.
