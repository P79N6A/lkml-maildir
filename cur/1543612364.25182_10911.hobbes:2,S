So ppl, plz help-me find this problem.
Once upon a time, I had 30/60 days uptime on my workstation, only rebooting for kernel updates or power faults. Nowadays, I've to reboot my machine every day because there's no physical memory available. I watch my disk burning in heavy I/O to open my X, browser, etc and stuff.
Then, one day, I decided to init 1; umount all and I saw the amazing release of 70% for my physical memory. I assumed that the disk cache had it all.
So, if this is correct, I want or to keep the cache under control or to flush it when I want. François Cami told me there is an option on aa's VM that helps me with that

Tnx for your help,
