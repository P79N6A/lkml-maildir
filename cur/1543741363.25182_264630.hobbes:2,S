Hi,
When there is a background thread doing VIDIOCSYNC in a loop, issuing
VIDIOCSPICT in the current thread on the same file descriptor causes
it to go into uninterruptable sleep and hang.  This is on kernel 2.6.8
using the bttv driver, and appears easily reproducible.
Anyone any ideas?
thanks,
Lennert
