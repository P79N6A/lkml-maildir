Apps using LinuxThreads seem to be candidates:
     According to POSIX 1003.1c, a successful `exec*' in one of the
     threads should automatically terminate all other threads in the
     program.  This behavior is not yet implemented in LinuxThreads.
     Calling `pthread_kill_other_threads_np' before `exec*' achieves
     much of the same behavior, except that if `exec*' ultimately
     fails, then all other threads are already killed.
steal_locks() was probably added as a workaround for this case, no?
I wonder how many installations still run LinuxThreads with 2.6 kernels.
