Thanks Ingo,
   I've set the HDSP priority to 80 using chrt. I'll continue to test away.
lightning ~ # ps -Leo pid,pri,rtprio,cmd | grep 58
 4559  78     38 [IRQ 58]
 8723  22      - grep 58
lightning ~ #  chrt -p 4559
pid 4559's current scheduling policy: SCHED_FIFO
pid 4559's current scheduling priority: 38
lightning ~ # chrt -p 80 4559
lightning ~ # chrt -p 4559
pid 4559's current scheduling policy: SCHED_RR
pid 4559's current scheduling priority: 80
lightning ~ #
   Can you suggest how I might be able to do this at boot time? Is
seems that the info is there but it requires figuring out the process
ID in a script and then running chrt in that script? Or is there a
simple place to configure how much priority I want to give a specific
IRQ?
   Anyway, thanks for all the help. I'll continue on. Probably I won't
see too many xruns with this set like this.
cheers,
Mark
