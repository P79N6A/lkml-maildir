So far i noticed:
with default scheduler:
When I run emerge sync (I am on gentoo) and finally the cache on disk 
gets updated (very heavy disk activity), default scheduler (in 
conjunction with cfq, haven' tried other) causes a schmall pause of 1-2 
seconds when I use my browser, ie mouse cursor is ok, but I cannot 
scroll for that time.
your scheduler: I tried it with the "love-sources", so maybe that patch 
"steel300" incorporated was already a bit outdated, but I dunno. It had 
the same version as above.  When I click on a link in thunderbird and it 
opens up in firefox (is started and just a new tab is created) the 
mouses stutters for a brief moment. This didn't happen with default 
scheduler. I dunno if above sympton happens with yours.
I haven't reniced X withy our patch. But I did it once and I didn't see 
much of a difference. (I dunno if the mouse stutter went away then...)
bye,
Prakash
