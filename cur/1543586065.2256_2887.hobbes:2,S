My turn to chime in.
JFS was designed around a 4K meta-data page size.  It would require some
major re-design to use larger block sizes.  On the other hand, JFS could
take advantage of 64-bit block addresses immediately.  JFS internally
store the block address in 40 bits.  (Sorry, file size & volume size are
both limited to 4 peta-bytes on JFS.)
At the rate that storage hardware and requirements are increasing,
increasing the block size is a short-term solution that is only going to
delay the inevitable requirement for 64-bit block addressability.  There
is a practical limit to a usable block-size.  Someone threw out 64K,
which seems reasonable to me.
