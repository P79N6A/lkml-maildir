It is fairly rare that syslogd or klogd actually die.  What occurs far
more often is that the scheduler croaks or disk I/O is unable to
complete.  The typical problem environment is one that ends in message
"Scheduling in interrupt" or "Aiee, killing interrupt handler" and the
entire machine is effectively dead.  Doing an auto restart of syslogd
or klogd does nothing for those cases.
