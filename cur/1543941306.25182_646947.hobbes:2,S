What I actually said was that the churn in the source base caused by
these sectional mismatches was getting out of hand.
What I questioned was the value of inspecting all the drivers and trying
to fix them all (and the effort involved) vs my proposed solution of
simply making 90% of them go away.

But on your own estimate, that's around 50 patches to fix all of this,
isn't it?  Which all have to be inspected, tested and integrated.  Is
that really a worthwhile exercise for saving 5k of memory (also from
your own estimate).  Particularly as the people who care about extreme
memory configurations aren't going "goody sections saved us 5k", they're
going "&^*&^ me the kernel increased in size by 150k on my system from
2.6.15 to 2.6.24".
