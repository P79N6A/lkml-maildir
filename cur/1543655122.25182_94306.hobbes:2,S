That'll be e2fsck saying that, when it tries to do journal replay.
I/O errors on the journal during replay not good.
Were there no I/O error messages reported from the device driver,

a shout as one flies past.

Well.  Changed driver, scsi layer, block layer, VFS and ext3.  Could
be anywhere :(

It would be useful to give the IO system a bit of a thrashing,
to narrow the problem down.  Just a `cat /dev/sda[n] > /dev/null'
would suit.
Bottom line: dunno.
