http://www.apache.org/docs/bind.html
 says:
"By default, it listens to all addresses on the machine, and to the port 
as specified by the Port directive in the server configuration."
As long as the user doesn't use Listen directives, Apache
shouldn't need to use multiple listen sockets, so we should be fine.
BTW, it looks like 
http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/perf-tuning.html
doesn't know yet about Unixes with wake-one semantics on new connection
arrival.  Maybe Dean could update it?
