Eric Biederman has been working on 'kexec', which is a fast
reboot (Linux boots Linux).  See
  
http://www.xmission.com/~ebiederm/files/kexec/
and
  
http://developer.osdl.org/
%7Eandyp/kexec/
for some 2.5.[67]x versions.  I'm trying to update it to
2.6.0-test3 and make it reboot successfully on my dual P4
machine.  Currently it hangs during the reboot.
