i'm leaning towards making this v2.6.25 material, as it affects the 
non-group-scheduling bits too and is rather large. When i tested it, 
group scheduling worked pretty well - at least for CPU bound tasks - and 
on SMP too. Could we live with what we have for now and defer this patch 
to v2.6.25? If not, could you split up this patch in a way to defer all 
the FAIR_GROUP_SCHED relevant changes to a separate patch which will not 
affect the !FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case at all? That will make the case much 
clearer.
