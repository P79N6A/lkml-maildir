Hi...
Following my little oddisey to let cd-burning easy for my users,
I think I have found another problem.
It looks like the formats available to cdrecord depend on being root
(cdrecord is not suid, if it is it complains it cant reserve some
buffers).
As root:
werewolf:/store/tmp# cdrecord -dummy dev=ATAPI:1,0,0 *.iso
...
Device seems to be: Generic mmc2 DVD-R/DVD-RW.
Using generic SCSI-3/mmc   CD-R/CD-RW driver (mmc_cdr).
Driver flags   : MMC-3 SWABAUDIO BURNFREE 
Supported modes: TAO PACKET SAO SAO/R96P SAO/R96R RAW/R16 RAW/R96P RAW/R96R
As user:
werewolf:/store/tmp> cdrecord -dummy dev=ATAPI:1,0,0 *.iso
...
cdrecord: Cannot allocate memory. WARNING: Cannot do mlockall(2).
cdrecord: WARNING: This causes a high risk for buffer underruns.
