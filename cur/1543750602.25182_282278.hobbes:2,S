I saw this message coming out of ac2 with my runaway IRQ 18 problem, so 
I tried irqpoll, and it just "went away" beyond sysreq or other gentle 
recovery.
I suspect that the problem lies in sharing the shared IRQ, and that 
polling doesn't solve the problem, just changes it to a hang witing for 
the misrouted IRQ. Still poking for the real cause, no patch or 
anything, but acpi={off,ht}, noapic, pci=routeirq, etc have no benefit 
(for me).
