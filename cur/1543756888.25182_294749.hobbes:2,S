I have some interesting information from one user, who noticed that:
* pbr is the power-on brightness. It's the brightness that the
  laptop uses at power-on time.
* cdp is the CD-ROM power. Writing 0 to cdp turns off the cdrom in
  order to save a bit of power consumption.
I'll add this information in the docs.
Stelian.
