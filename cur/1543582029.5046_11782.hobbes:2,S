Hey, just found this one out.
I've got a sony vaio 505tx, running linux-2.4.1-ac1, and I've got all
the good stuff turned.
With APM turned, and using USB uhci-alt driver (all as modules), if you
put the laptop to sleep with any (and I mean *any*) usb devices plugged
in, it will hard lock upon resume.
Only way out is to power cycle the poor thing..
I'm going to update to a newer version of the kernel, and see if the
other uhci driver suffers from this fate..
