Hi
Recent postings on this suggest some changes/problems with
aic7xxx, but none of them seems to be like this.
It seems that the aic7xxx driver while booting a SMP enabled
2.4.22 kernel waits (lock-up?) forever.
The lock-up does not happen if I disable SMP, make distclean
and recompile the kernel.
The controller used is a PCI based Adaptec 29160 (aic7892).
The board is a dual Pentium III DBD100 from Iwill.
Compiler GCC 3.2.3
Distro : Slackware 9.1
Has anyone else seen this ?
Kind regards
