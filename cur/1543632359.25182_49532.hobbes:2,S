I don't think so, I took extra care to leave it all the same. (Well, 
except for sound/, which is outside drivers/) It'd however surely be a 
good idea to go through it and document which dependencies there are.
There's surely stuff which could be cleaned up (Jeff, as you're CC'ed 
anyway, look where tulip/ is linked in drivers/net/Makefile, I think that 
could be straightened up a bit)
W.r.t to the original problem I have to say I didn't really look into yet, 
but I think it makes e.g. a lot of sense to initialize networking earlier 
(subsys_initcall). We have initcall levels, using them right will help a 
lot. (The block subsystem is only __initcall a.k.a. driver_initcall as 
well, that's asking for problems at some point)
