So would you be happy with kB -> 1,000 bytes, and KB -> 1024 bytes?  Likewise
mB for 1,000,000 bytes and MB for 1048576 bytes?
Look, there's some precedent for it here:
   
http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictK.html
   "K - an informal abbreviation for one thousand used in expressions where 
   the unit is understood, such as "10K run" (10 kilometers) or "700K disk" 
   (700 kilobytes or kibibytes). Note that "K" is also the symbol for the 
   kelvin (see below). Also note that the symbol for the metric prefix kilo- 
   (1000) is actually k-, not K-."
If you believe that, then we don't have a problem, we never did:
  kB -> 1,000 bytes
  KB -> 1024 bytes
So, KiB is a silly fix for a problem that doesn't exist.  Let's not have that 
silliness creeping into our documentation, making it look silly too.
