I experienced some performance loss when moving from kernel 2.4.4 to
2.4.7-ac3 regarding ide harddisks. I am useing the hpt ataraid driver
which does pretty much the same thing as the md disk striping driver.
I/O speed of the raid volume is about as fast as accessing a single
drive.
There were a lot of ide reports some time ago. Maybe they where problems
with concurrent I/O operations...?
