There are also flash and similar absolute space footprints to consider.
Experiments seem to suggest that consolidating the lock sections and
other spinlock code can reduce kernel image size by as much as 220KB on
ia32 with no performance impact (rigorous benchmarks still in progress).
That said, I agree with zwane's interrupt enablement change.
