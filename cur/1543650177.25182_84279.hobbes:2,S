I don't say anything about creating incompatible versions of the same
filesystem.  Configuring out nsec timestamps is no different than what
we have today.  Many filesystems do not support nsec timestamps anyways.
I just see this as one of many hundreds of "tiny" features that are
added to Linux that could easily be made a config option when they
are first added, but all just end up adding a tiny bit of bloat for
people that don't need it.
Cheers, Andreas
