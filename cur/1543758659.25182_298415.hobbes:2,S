Maybe this is a bit overdone?
Of course you can have suspend-to-disk on most embedded systems; CF
flash card looks just like disk, and you should be able to suspend to
it.
If OMAP has "big sleep" and "deep sleep", why not simply map them to
"standby" and "suspend-to-ram"?
[OTOH patch is not that long; but strings in /sys filesystem are not
for human consumption anyway.]
