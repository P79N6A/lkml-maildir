You can take the "x86_32: make percpu symbols zerobased on SMP" patch
and the above ifdef won't be necessary along with similar one in
setup_percpu.c.  The above ifdef is because 64 is zero based while 32
is not.  If you want something, say, __per_cpu_base_off or something
to be defined conditionally and used in these two cases, I'm not sure
whether that would clean up the code or obfuscate it.  :-)
Thanks.
