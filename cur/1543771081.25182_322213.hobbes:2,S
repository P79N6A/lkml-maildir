Hi people.
I am seeing both VFAT and Ext3 becoming corrupted when using
synchronous mount on MMC card (kernel is 2.6.12-rc2-omap1, HW is a
test board with Omap 1710).  The problem is reproduced by mounting a
MMC card synchronously and copying large file onto it.
Typically I insert vfat/ext3 formatted MMC card and do:
  mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/mmc1 -t vfat -o sync
  cp /lib/libc-2.3.2.so  /media/mmc1
or
  mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/mmc1 -t ext2 -o noatime,sync
  cp /lib/libc-2.3.2.so  /media/mmc1
The results are further below. I have tried to reproduce VFAT problen
in desktop PC with loopback device but to no avail. I have used
different MMC cards but the problem persists. Disabling DMA reduces
the number of error messages or pushes the first occurence a bit
further, but does not remove the problem.
Very similar problem appears when writing a large file onto ext2
formatted MMC card. The problem disappears if I mount asynchronoysly.
Also similarly the problem on VFAT disappears when mounting
asynchronously.
The VFAT problem seems to have appeared around January -- February
this year but it is hard to tell the exact point and changeset. For
ext2 I haven't done similar search.
Because there are two so similar problems appearing with two separate
file-systems, I doubt this is VFAT or Ext3 only problem, but more
likely problem in the mmc driver. It would be good to try this out on
other on some other hardware using the same mmc core code. Has anybody
else seen these?
