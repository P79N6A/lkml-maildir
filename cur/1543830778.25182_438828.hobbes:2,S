Hi,
Did you intend to push this patch for -stable or for the next version of
Linux? In general if you wanted to do the later, it's a good idea to
make a patch against the latest tree rather than a really old one....
While if you meant the former you probably want to at least CC
stable@vger.kernel.org .... 
Greetings,
   Arjan van de Ven
