Does the video4linux drivers support the NeoMagic NM 2160's tv input
fucntions (not a function of X like the output probably is)?
If not, are there docs on it that people know of or is this one of
those, don't tell any body how to support our chipset chipsets?
Any information would be greatly appreciated.
