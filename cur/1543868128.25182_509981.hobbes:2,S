Hello,
Is it possible that OOM isn't handled very well if say, my entire
file system structure is on a USB storage device?
I'm not an expert on this particular matter but I'm pretty sure 
that I noticed GFP_KERNEL allocation being done on the write-out 
path in the usb-storage kernel thread, leading to a deadlock 
during OOM.
Suggestions are welcomed...
