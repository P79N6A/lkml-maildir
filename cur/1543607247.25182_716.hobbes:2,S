Which module is that? I can't find it in Linus tree.
Is "info" a global variable?
* poll is called without any SMP locking, "info->poll_active++" is not SMP safe. Use atomic_inc, or even better just delete that
line.
* Clearing poll_mask during poll is wrong.
poll should return the events that are currently available, i.e. what would happen if read() or write() would be called now.
read() on a non-blocking file handle would return immediately with 1 or more bytes read --> set POLLIN
write() on a non-blocking file handle would return immediately with a nonzero byte count written--> set POLLOUT.
The clearing of poll_mask must occur during read() and write() if these conditions are not true anymore.
