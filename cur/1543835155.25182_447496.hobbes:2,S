Except that kevent has completely different structures and it is
possible to have a lot of more types of event than AIO has and there is
no need to specially have bytes, offsets and so on.
Magic pointer returned from aio syscall is no pollable too.

It is true for all shared resources no matter if it is file descriptor or 
mapped area.

If I understand you correct you are talking about level triggering
events, which arrive continuously? Such events are handled by only one
kevent, if iti is ready, that means that at least one such event was
fired. One can add a number of fired events as a hints inside kevent.

It is user who should decide either he wants one, all or at least one
eventt. kevent supports all types of requests, it's behaviour depends on
parameters.
