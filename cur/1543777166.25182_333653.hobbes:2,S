Andrew,
	This should apply cleanly ontop of Linus's tree.
----------------------------------------------------------
This patch addresses a potential race condition for a case where
Kprobe has been removed right after another CPU has taken
a break hit.
The way this is addressed here is when the CPU that has taken a break hit
does not find its corresponding kprobe, then we check to see if the
original instruction got replaced with other than break. If it got
replaced with other than break instruction, then we continue to execute
from the replaced instruction, else if we find that it is still a break, then
we let the kernel handle this, as this might be the break instruction inserted by
other than kprobe(may be kernel debugger).
This patch applies on top of  "Prasanna S Panchamukhi's" recent postings
