DualFS can probably get around this corner case as it is up to the user
to select the size of the MD device size. If you want to prevent this
corner case you can always use a device bigger than 10% of the data device
which is exagerate for any FS assuming that the directory files are so
large (this is when you have billions of files with long names).
In general the problem you mention is mainly due to the data blocks
filling the file system. In DualFS case you have the choice of selecting
different sizes for the MD and Data volume. When Data volume gets full
the GC will have a problem but the MD device will not have a problem.
It is my understanding that most of the GC problem you mention is
due to the filling of the FS with data and the result is a MD operation
being disrupted by the filling of the FS with data blocks. As about the
performance impact on solving this problem, as you mentioned all
journal FSs will have this problem, I am sure that DualFS performance
impact will be less than others at least due to using only one MD
write instead of 2.
