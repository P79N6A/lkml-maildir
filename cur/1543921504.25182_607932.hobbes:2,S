Hi.
I have an external hard drive with an encrypted partition. I am using
kde so all i had to do under 2.6.23 was
  "cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb2 crypt-extern"
then udev/hal/kde (?)automatically created an desktop icon. i could
click this icon to mount and open the drive.
when i do the luksOpen command with v2.6.23-6597-gcfa76f0 this icon is
not created anymore.
a few commits were made in drivers/md, so it seems something broke.
config extract:
CONFIG_MD=y
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_MD is not set
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM=y
# CONFIG_DM_DEBUG is not set
CONFIG_DM_CRYPT=y
CONFIG_DM_SNAPSHOT=m
CONFIG_DM_MIRROR=m
CONFIG_DM_ZERO=m
# CONFIG_DM_MULTIPATH is not set
CONFIG_DM_DELAY=m
CONFIG_DM_UEVENT=y
# CONFIG_FUSION is not set
any ideas?
