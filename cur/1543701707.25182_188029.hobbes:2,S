Are you aware that your change brakes "idex=base", "idex=base,ctl"
and "idex=base,ctl,irq" kernel parameters?  If these parameters are used
hwif->chipset is also set to ide_generic.  Now if controller is a PCI one
and PCI IDE support is compiled in hwif->chipset will be set to
ide_pci_takeover and drives won't be probed.

When it fails controller+drives are not being programmed correctly
(because probe_hwif() returns early).  "takeover" is not supported because
you need to reprogram controller/drive to do DMA, but probing code
(which does also reprogramming) can race with actual data transfer.

I think proper fix is to add IDE generic host driver and make it modular.
