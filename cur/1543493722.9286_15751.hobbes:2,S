Hi,
i think i have to report a bug that crashes 2.2.6 quite
badly.
I've put the zImage, the description of the problem,
the System.map, the configuration file and the Oops
output to my web site at:
http://www.stuttgart.netsurf.de/~tmohr/bug/bugreport.html
This site can't be accessed via
http://www.stuttgart.netsurf.de/~tmohr
because there is no "index.html".  There is also a
http://www.stuttgart.netsurf.de/~tmohr/linux.html
Best regards,
Torsten Mohr.
