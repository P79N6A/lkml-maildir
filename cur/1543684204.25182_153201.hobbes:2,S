Okay, I'll have a look at it. Where's the 2.6.x version?

I've got no idea when this version will come up. What's the (Debian)
timeline for a gcc-3.4 based libstdc++ then? I've already tried
gcc-snapshot's libstdc++, but that's libstdc++6, which won't link with
todays applications...
Well, it's not only that. Seen the thread named like "Time loss on
i486"? That'll be some fun, too:)
