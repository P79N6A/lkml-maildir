I would prefer if we explicitly initialize cpu_tlbstate during cpu_init:
it's cleaner, and it prevents any ordering problems within switch_mm()
[there is a tiny race, around 30 instructions]
Do you have any further crashes due to the tlb changes? I was running
with my debug patches without any special messages.
Oh. Are you using gcc-2.95? I forgot to mark the cpu_tlbstate array as
volatile [arch/i386/kernel/smp.c and include/asm/pgalloc.h], could you
change that?
