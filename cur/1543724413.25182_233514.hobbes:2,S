I do not see anywhere in my boot log suggestion to activate profiling...
Nor I see recommendadtion to use idebus=66... But i will see suggesion to
set loops_per_jiffy.

Use of this particular option will require active tracking of kernel timer
code to ensure that lpj that was valid for kernel x.y.z is still valid for
kernel x.y.z+1. I do not beleive that normal user will ever care to do that
even in very distant future. Still, given that message in the boot log, many
will probably try the option.
I am no longer question presence of the code in the kernel, I just don't like
the message...
