Sorry, again: I'm currently using plain 2.4.9 patched with -pre12.
I get the allocation errors. I got the image from kernel.dk/testing/ today
morning, as someone posted this address on the list.
My previous kernel is plain 2.4.9 patched with Marcelo's patched and in a
week period I did not receive nay single error message like that.
