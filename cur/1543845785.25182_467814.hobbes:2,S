As I answered in your first e-mail, yes, you just need to patch 2.6.18
tree and load one of the crypto provider.
Acrypto works with request/response model, i.e. you ask acrypto core to
perform some operation on given buffers and if it can, it will call
your callback when it is ready (or some error happend and acrypto was
unable to reroute request to other device), otherwise it will return error.
With such a model it is possible to extend acrypto to any kind of
operations on buffers, not only crypto related, for example it is
possible to onload IPsec header transformation, perform DMA between
specified areas and much more.
