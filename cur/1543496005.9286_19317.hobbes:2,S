This should really be in some other list..
A sequence point is a term from the C89 standard used to formalise what
things may be reordered by the compiler. If A is a piece of code, B is
a sequence point and C is a second piece of code, and B lies between A
and C, then the compiler may not generate an executable which permits
effects of C to be apparent before effects of A.
By example, the above contraint means that if C uses some value affected by A,
then the value used in C must be that as it would be at the completion of A.

Many, many Christians claim a personal relationship with Jesus. I do not know
whether this helps their bowling scores.
