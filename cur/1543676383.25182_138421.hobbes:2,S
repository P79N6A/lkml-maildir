   Why do you care ?
Because ATM devices have always been "funny", and there
is so much infrastructure, and frankly sanity, they can
share by being more netdevice like.
All the lack of proper SMP locking and races are a result
of ATM devices being different and not being fixed up
when we did all of the SMP work for netdevices.
Chas has to do a lot of work now that would not have been
necessary.
   (If you want to keep Chas busy, the communication between
   the kernel and its demons may be a much more interesting
   topic ;-)
   
Tell me it at least uses netlink ;(
