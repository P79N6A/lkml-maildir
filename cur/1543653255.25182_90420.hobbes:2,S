That is as bad as unsigned long - it is different between 32-bit and 64-bit
ABIs.
Unless you handle the translation in the generic epoll code, there will
need to be wrappers around it which will kmalloc (maxelements * sizeof (struct epollfd));
do the generic epoll into that array and then translate all the structures
in that array into smaller ones and copy to userspace.
