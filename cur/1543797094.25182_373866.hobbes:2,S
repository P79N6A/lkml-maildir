No they're not. Both are just about equally expensive cpu wise,
sometimes the atomic_t ones are a bit more expensive (like on parisc
architecture). But on x86 in either case it's a locked cycle, which is
just expensive no matter which side you flip the coin...

there's different usage patterns where either makes sense. 
In this case it looks just disgusting on very first sight; the atomic
are used to implement a lock, and that lock itself is then implemented
with a spinlock again. For me, again on first sight, the real solution
appears to be to use a linux primitive for the higher level lock in the
first place, instead of reimplementing <your own thing> with <another
own thing>.
