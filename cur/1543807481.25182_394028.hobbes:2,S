Yes, /sbin/init would need to be modified to use whatever enhanced api
is produced to support cross-container wait and pidlookup.  I'm not sure
that in this set of threads we've discussed enhanced wait requirements,
though for pidlookup it's been mentioned that we can just require some
kind of
	sys_execute_container(pid_lookup(pid));
to avoid having to expand userspace pid lookup routines - ie to avoid
having any userspace code (except init) need to know about containers.
But perhaps a per-container init is in fact cleaner.  Other opinions?
