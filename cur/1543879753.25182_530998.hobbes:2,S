Chuckle, possibly but then I'm not anything even remotely close to an expert 
here Con, just reporting what I get.  And I just rebooted to 2.6.21-rc6 + 
sched-mike-5.patch for grins and giggles, or frowns and profanity as the case 
may call for.

I think I'd need a bit of tutoring on how to do that.  I recall that one other 
time, several weeks back, I thought I would try one of those famous echo this 
>/proc/that ideas that went by on this list, but even though I was root, 
apparently /proc was read-only AFAIWC.

And now I wonder if I applied the right patch.  This one feels good ATM, but I 
don't think its the CFS thingy.  No, I'm sure of it now, none of the patches 
I've saved say a thing about CFS.  Backtrack up the list time I guess, ignore 
me for the nonce.
