1) the journalist may be good, but his english was far from
   fluent, there was some confusion at times during the
   interview
2) the interview was done quite informally on IRC, with me
   replying in normal IRC style  ...  it appears however
   that the sentence fragments were just cut'n'pasted
   together into something gramatically dubious, this has
   messed up the contents in some places ;)
3) I guess this whole stuff was converted to gramatically
   correct Italian, possibly meaning something slightly
   different from the text in (2), definately something
   else than what I wanted to say.
I guess this is the last time I'm giving an interview to a
journalist who isn't fluent in any of the languages I'm
fluent in ;)
cheers,
Rik
