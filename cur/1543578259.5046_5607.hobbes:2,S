The no-swap behaviour shoul dactually be pretty much identical, simply
because both 2.2 and 2.4 will do the same thing: just skip dirty pages in
the page tables because they cannot do anything about them.
That said, the _other_ VM differences in 2.4.x may obviously make a
difference, just not the sticky swap cache one..
