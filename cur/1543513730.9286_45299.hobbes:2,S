ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs/raw-io
for raw IO on 2.2.12.  The 2.3 kernels already include the kernel
support.  Red Hat 6.1 shipped with raw IO.

Umm, Unix block devices can write arbitrary bytes of data.  Because the
block device access is buffered, the kernel is able to deal with the
underlying block structure entirely transparently to the application.
Raw IO is restricted to entire blocks, however, since it does not have
the buffer cache to assist it.

Nope.  All raw devices are character devices.  All block devices
necessarily use the buffer cache: a block device is defined internally
as something which can service buffer cache IO requests.  Raw devices
cannot be presented as block devices.

See above. :)

O_SYNC is still going to be cached: it will just write the cache back to
disk immediately the cache has been updated.  The copy in memory still
stays there.

They are there now.  There are basically three advantages for raw IO.
First of all there is performance: by doing DMA directly from the user
process's data buffer to disk, we avoid the CPU cost of doing an extra
copy when we write to a raw device.  Secondly there is memory usage:
avoiding the buffer cache means we are using memory more efficiently if
the application knows that there is no benefit from O/S caching.
Thirdly, however, there is a major class of applications which simply
cannot work on cached devices.  Consider a shared-disk clustered
database where multiple nodes are accessing the same disk at once.  If
you are reading from cache, you may read the wrong data --- there is a
chance that another node has modified the disk since you read your copy
into cache.  Raw IO is absolutely necessary to support such applications.

If the reads are truly sequential and only 1 byte long, then the only
time this should happen is if the buffer cache is busy enough that the
block has been discarded from the cache between the reads.

Yes it will be: the cache reads entire blocks/sectors at a time, necessarily.

There is, but it will only be triggered on the next actual IO in this
case.

Yes you can.  The kernel will cache the rest of the block for you.

No it doesn't: the kernel locks the drive door while the file is open,
and only tests disk change when it is closed and then reopened.
