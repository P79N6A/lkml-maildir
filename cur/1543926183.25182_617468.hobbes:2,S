::: Can you give me exact details of how to set up and reproduce this?
:::  -- Kernel version
	Linux-2.6.23.1
	NOTE: I am using ppc (arch/ppc instead of arch/powerpc)
:::  -- number/config/model of drives
	2x250GIG Western Digital - 3 partitions (largest (/dev/sda3
	~200Gig - formatted to ext2).
	7042 PEX on a MPC8548 Board
:::  -- exact command line sequence to cause the failure
	NFS mount root file system (I am currently rebuild to take away
	the NFS file system dependency) - /dev/sda3 is drive in
question...
		a) mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/src 
		b) cp large_500Meg_file /mnt/src/.
==========================================================
==========================================================
NOTE: this does NOT fail on a 2.6.11 kernel version!!!!
	So I do NOT think it's a hardware problem!
	It could be a PEX related problem with arch/ppc - I would
	expect under heavy pounding with smaller files it would
	fail as well - but it does NOT)
