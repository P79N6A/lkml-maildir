Well, I don't know. With the 830mp_setup, I get
  (WW) RADEON(0): Bad V_BIOS checksum
in the X log (hard) and a few other sporadic effects that I cannot nail down.
With the intel_845_setup, everything appears to be OK.
Board is a D845PESVL with Radeon 7500.
As the D845G have onboard VGA and the PE not, I would suspect
that maybe a different init sequence is necessary.
