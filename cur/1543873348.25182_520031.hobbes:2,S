It seems to fix the leak. I looked at the logs and proc_set_tty calls
put_pid twice for pid 245 (the unresolved leak) and get_pid for pid
296, which is later passed to put_pid via do_tty_hangup.
I still get the "error attempted to write to tty [0x00000000] = NULL"
when debugging is enabled in tty_io.c but it seems harmless.

And I don't have a fully tested kmemleak patch to post either :-).
Thanks.
