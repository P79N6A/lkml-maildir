Something along the lines of pcvt (*BSD)
for full userspace line discipline handling on
the console would be great. Read: much saner then trying to do this all
in kernel like
linux does currently. Maybe the linux way was justified during the days
of 386sx 16MHz
somehow. Currently it's relly just plain ugly. Try using some other
character set then iso8859-1 on the linux console to see why.
