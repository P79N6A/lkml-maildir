Hello,
  Some things have changed between rc5-mm1 and rc4-mm3.  During my build
process I pickup the following errors when making the initrd. I don't
see any errors during modules_install. 
WARNING: /var/tmp/mkinitramfs.N19592/mnt/lib/modules/2.6.18-rc5-mm1-
smp/kernel/drivers/acpi/processor.ko needs unknown symbol

WARNING: /var/tmp/mkinitramfs.N19592/mnt/lib/modules/2.6.18-rc5-mm1-
smp/kernel/drivers/scsi/scsi_mod.ko needs unknown symbol blk_free_tags
My config build all of SCSI as modules and loads them into an initrd.
As I build things into the kernel the errors go away but if I build say
scsi support into the kernel all the symbols from host.c start not
linking (lots and lots of unknown symbols)  
Maybe these are just warning from my mkinird scrips (SLES based) but I
wasn't seeing these until rc5-mm1.  The symbols in question seem to be
exported correctly so I am not sure what the deal is. 
Has some linker / module script been changed or is my mkinitrd script
off in la-la land? 
Thanks,
  Keith
