I have successfully (finally) installed MPPE and PPP with PPP 2.40 and Linux
Kernel 2.4.2.  However, anytime I allow and use MPPE-40 packets will not
forward into a VPN.  If I comment it out and use MPPE-STATELESS or MPPE-128
it works fine.  As soon as MPPE-40 is uncommented, it fails to operate.
What can I do to fix this?
