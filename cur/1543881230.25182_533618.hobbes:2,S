Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86_64: Remove CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START and CONFIG_RELOCATABLE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/23/10

Now that the vmlinux is marked as relocatable there is no reason to
retain the CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START option, as we can put the binary we
have at any 2MB aligned address in memory.
With CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START gone the handful of code lines that depend
on CONFIG_RELOCATABLE no longer make sense to be conditional and can
be removed.
The big win of this patch (besides Kconfig simplicity) is that the
nasty BUILD_BUG_ON test for people misaligning their kernel when using
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START can be removed as this case can only happen with
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START selected.

-	help
-	  Builds a relocatable kernel. This enables loading and running
-	  a kernel binary from a different physical address than it has
-	  been compiled for.
-
-	  One use is for the kexec on panic case where the recovery kernel
-	  must live at a different physical address than the primary
-	  kernel.
-
-	  Note: If CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y, then kernel run from the address
-	  it has been loaded at and compile time physical address
-	  (CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START) is ignored.
-
-config PHYSICAL_START
-	hex "Physical address where the kernel is loaded" if (EMBEDDED || CRASH_DUMP)
-	default "0x200000"
-	help
-	  This gives the physical address where the kernel is loaded. It
-	  should be aligned to 2MB boundary.
-
-	  If kernel is a not relocatable (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n) then
-	  bzImage will decompress itself to above physical address and
-	  run from there. Otherwise, bzImage will run from the address where
-	  it has been loaded by the boot loader and will ignore above physical
-	  address.
-
-	  In normal kdump cases one does not have to set/change this option
-	  as now bzImage can be compiled as a completely relocatable image
-	  (CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y) and be used to load and run from a different
-	  address. This option is mainly useful for the folks who don't want
-	  to use a bzImage for capturing the crash dump and want to use a
-	  vmlinux instead.
-
-	  So if you are using bzImage for capturing the crash dump, leave
-	  the value here unchanged to 0x200000 and set CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y.
-	  Otherwise if you plan to use vmlinux for capturing the crash dump
-	  change this value to start of the reserved region (Typically 16MB
-	  0x1000000). In other words, it can be set based on the "X" value as
-	  specified in the "crashkernel=YM@XM" command line boot parameter
-	  passed to the panic-ed kernel. Typically this parameter is set as
-	  crashkernel=64M@16M. Please take a look at
-	  Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt for more details about crash dumps.
-
-	  Usage of bzImage for capturing the crash dump is advantageous as
-	  one does not have to build two kernels. Same kernel can be used
-	  as production kernel and capture kernel.
-
-	  Don't change this unless you know what you are doing.
