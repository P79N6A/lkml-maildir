Web server. The only writing is for the log files, which is relatively
minimal.
You can see from the io, that writes are relatively infrequent, while
reads happen regularly to fetch various documents from disk.
One thing also, is there is lots of process creation in this example.
For a variety of reasons, PHP programs are forked often from the Apache
server.
The systems running an older kernel (like RedHat's 2.4.9-21) are much
more consistent in their usage of memory. There are no 150MB swings in
cache utiliziation, etc.
What's really odd in the vmstat output is the fact that there is no disk
I/O that follows these wild swings. Where is this cache memory coming
from? Or is the accounting just wrong?
