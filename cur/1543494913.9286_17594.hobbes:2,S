Apache was built with the following flags:  
(-DSINGLE_LIST_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT is not amoung them. )
./configure --prefix=/usr --libexecdir=/usr/lib/apache --sysconfdir=/etc/httpd/conf --datadir=/home/httpd --includedir=/usr/include/apache --logfiledir=/var/log/httpd --localstatedir=/var --runtimedir=/var/run  --proxycachedir=/var/cache/httpd  --enable-m
odule=all --enable-shared=max --disable-rule=WANTHSREGEX
Would it be better to build with -DSINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT?  Is
this something that would help or hurt the "thundering herd" problem?
