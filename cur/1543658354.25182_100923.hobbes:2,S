I'd [g]uess [n]ot too many, b[u]t the [linux] kernel list admins are
pretty good about keeping the bans non-political.  Whoops, looks like
this messa[g]e gets sent to /dev/[nu]ll.  So much for [linux]
development discussion..
Maybe without the .*s all over the place....
(For the humour impaired, no, I'm not actually advocating such a ban.)
