Writes are more expensive than reads. Apart from the aggressive read
caching on the disk, writes have limited caching or no caching at all if
you need security (journalling, for example). (I'm not sure about write
caching details, any harddisk expert?)
On read intensive loads, doing IO to free memory (writing pages out) will
be horribly harmful for these reads (which you can free easily), so its
better to avoid the writes as much as possible.
I remember Matthew Dillon (FreeBSD VM guy) had a read intensive case were
using 20:1 clean/flush ratio to free pages in FreeBSD's launder routine
(at that time, IIRC, their launder routine was looping twice the inactive
dirty list looking for clean pages to throw away, and only on the third
loop it would do IO) was still being a problem for disk performance
because of the writes. Yes, it sounds weird.
I suppose you're running dbench.
