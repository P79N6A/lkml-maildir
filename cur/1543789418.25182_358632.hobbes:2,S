Hi,
I am using a orinoco wireless pcmcia card on 2.6.14-rc4.
The driver works great but I just got a little problem.
Something wrong occured on my laptop (I don't know what)
causing the orinoco driver to print
	wifi: Error -16 transmitting packet
(wifi is the name of the interface).
The problem is that I got such a message each millisecond.
This took 100% CPU, completely locking the box, until I removed
the pcmcia card.
What I now see in /var/log/messages is:
hermes @ 00012100: Card removed while waiting for command 0x0011 completion.
hermes @ 00012100: Card removed while waiting for command 0x0021 completion.
printk: 4567 messages suppressed.
printk: 4564 messages suppressed.
nsmitting packet
printk: 4566 messages suppressed.
printk: 4603 messages suppressed.
<3: Error -16 transmitting packet
<nsmitting packet
: Error -16 transmitting packet
<: Error -16 transmitting packet
Actually, the card got removed _after_ all these messages.
It was still supposed to be plugged when the "Card removed"
messages appeared.
Is there any way to avoid this message flooding ?
Or is this kind of error so rare that it is not worth doing it ?
Regards,
Brice Goglin
