Yes, that is one way. It works well if you only extend structures at the end.
Given that you need to obtain the file descriptor first via a pfm_create_context
call, an alternative could be that you pass a version number to that call to
identify the version the application is requesting.

I don't like those cast_ulp() macros. They were put there to avoid compiler
warnings on some architectures. Clearly with the big-endian issue, we need
to find something else. The bitmap*() macros make unsigned long *.
The interface uses fixed size type to ensure ABI compatibility between
32 and 64 bit modes. This way there is no need to marhsall syscall arguments
for a 32-bit app running on a 64-bit host.
Looks like we will have to use bytes (u8) instead.  This may have some
performance impact as well. Several bitmaps are used in the context/interrupt
routines. Even with u8, there is still a problem with the bitmap*() macros.
Now, only a small subset of the bitmap() macros are used, so it may be okay
to duplicate them for u8.
What do you think?
