High precision? No. We do have "jiffies since boot". We don't actually
expose it anywhere, although you _can_ get it's "standardized version",
aka "centi-seconds per boot" from things like /proc/uptime.
(Not high-performance, but such an interface _could_ be. It's one of the
few things we could trivially map into the "system call page", and have
accessible to user space with just a simple read - faster even than the
"fast gettimeofday" implementations).
The thing is, most people who want the time of day want a real time with
some precision. Getting "approximate uptime" really really _really_ fast
might be useful for some things, but I don't know how many.
