If you want my 2Cent:
 - stop these rather useless specifications and provide patchkits instead
 - try to actually submit the patches upstream to get a feeling which
   of your 'features' are compltely hopeless, which are okay and which
   can better be solved in different ways.
(same applies to CGL/DCL/$INDUSTRYCONSORTIUM)
