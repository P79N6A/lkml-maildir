Very good. Applied. Thanks!
(do get_bio(&bio) before submit_bio(&bio) and do put_bio(&bio)
afterwards and examine bio.flags&BIO_UPTODATE on return from
wait_for_completion between the two).

Good idea. rl is inviolate, but I set at least |=REQ_NOMERGE sometimes
on flags. And I pass ioctl information in fake requests by setting
the bit just beyond the edge of those currently used (__REQ_BITS) to
indicate its an ioctl and treating it specially in end request. Maybe
on error I forgot to remove the extra bit before doing put_blk_request
..
WIll look.
Thanks again.
