Debian wants /dev/shm mounted "noexec" for whatever reason,
these apps want otherwise: to be able to mmap PROT_EXEC on it.

No, it's not.  But this doesn't have much to do with tmpfs,
nor with shm_open.  It's just that the kernel is not allowing
mmap PROT_EXEC on a MNT_NOEXEC mount.  Which seems reasonable
(though you can argue that mprotect ought to disallow it too).
If that's a problem for something, don't mount "noexec"
(but I'm not the one to recommend a secure configuration).

That would be tiresome work.

Exactly.
