That patch was accidentally created on top of another patch which I
haven't posted yet, so it didn't apply cleanly. Can you please try
again with the patch below and 2.6.16-rc2-git10 or later?
If that still doesn't work as expected, how did you eject the disc?
With the button or with the eject command? If it was the eject
command, please run eject with strace and send the output to me.
pktcdvd: Don't unlock the door if the disc is in use
