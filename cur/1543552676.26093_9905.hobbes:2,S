If you look at the original routine (arch/i386/mm/init.c:test_wp_bit),
you'll see that its purpose is to test the capabilities of the CPU's
MMU (to differentiate the old 386's that didn't honor WP in supervisor
mode), which is why it does this little dance - to provoke a page
fault.
Anyway, the probable fix has already been posted (i.e. don't use gcc
2.7.2.*)
