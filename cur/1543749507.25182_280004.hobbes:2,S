In a PCI driver (well, just about any driver for a modern bus) you have
an probe and an remove entry.  All code to setup and teardown a device must
happen in those functions, and must not use global state but only the device
instance pointers. 
btw, no need to Cc linux-ia64, there's nothing ia64-specific in this driver.
