This one got fixed in 2.5.34-bk6 and is ok in 2.5.35.
One may boot from a root RAID-1 now, if it don't
need to resync.
The kernel dies within a minute or two 
if it has to resync a sufficiently big
raid-1 though - by freezing solid.  Sometimes
with several 0-order allocation failures first.
this is a known problem.
This is made a bit worse by the way later
kernels also makes shutdown segfault so
the RAID's cannot be shutdown correctly.
My solution is to always boot 2.5.7 for
a correct 5-min sync after shutdown, before testing
a new kernel. :-/
