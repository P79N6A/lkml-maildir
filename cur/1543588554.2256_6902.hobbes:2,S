You need the following patch on i386.  I am not attaching any
diff for other architectures , since I do not know which version
of gcc on other architectures started implementing this feature.
If gcc 2.96 uniformly implements it, I'd rather move this
backward compatibility definition of __builtin_expect from
include/asm-$(arch)/compiler.h to include/asm-generic/
somewhere.
