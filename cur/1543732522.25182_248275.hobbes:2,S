I built 2.6.9-rc1-mm2 last night, and I've had this happen on 2 separate file systems today:
Sep  2 12:42:50 turing-police kernel: journal_bmap: journal block not found at offset 2316 on dm-6
Sep  2 12:42:52 turing-police kernel: Aborting journal on device dm-6.
Sep  2 12:42:52 turing-police kernel: ext3_abort called.
Sep  2 12:42:53 turing-police kernel: EXT3-fs error (device dm-6): ext3_journal_start: Detected aborted journal
Sep  2 12:42:53 turing-police kernel: Remounting filesystem read-only
Sep  2 12:42:54 turing-police kernel: EXT3-fs error (device dm-6) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
Sep  2 12:42:54 turing-police kernel: EXT3-fs error (device dm-6) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
Sep  2 12:42:54 turing-police kernel: journal commit I/O error
Sep  2 12:42:54 turing-police kernel: EXT3-fs error (device dm-6) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
Sep  2 12:42:57 turing-police last message repeated 15 times
(This one was /home - I'd paste the other one, but it happened on /var so
it didn't get logged because /var/adm/messages went R/O..)
Of interest:
1) Didn't see this under 2.6.8-mm4.
2) Neither time had any actual disk I/O error messages...
3) I'm using ext3-on-LVM, if that matters...
