Actually, you can allow the spindown with open write-filehandles. You
have to remember to spin it up and remount r/w when activity happens.
I'd really like my systems to remount RO if ilde for long times. I
have a few systems that occasionally stop unexpectedly, and not having
to fsck the non-active filesystems would save a lot of time.
(I've decided I dislike reiser: It ate two of my sources, because I
crashed the machine before the sources hit the disk. But the metadata
had been updated to indicate that the overwritten source was in a
different spot on the disk than the old sources. Having to go back to
an older version is less bad than losing the source altogether. 
Yes, I could turn on data-loggin. Yes, I could type "sync" before
insmodding the new driver.)
