Andrew,
this is an updated replacement queue against -mm3 , with all the
fixlets backmerged to the appropriate places (Build-fix-from: added).
The queue contains further:
- accounting weirdness fixup, which solves Valdis problem
- command line option to disable high resolution mode on boot
- resolution config option removed
- TSC marked unusable for high resolution mode, due to circular
  dependency problems
- Comments for the secret PIT fix :)
The broken out series is available at the usual place:
