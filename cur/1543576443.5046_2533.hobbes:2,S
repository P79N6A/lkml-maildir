Alan,
Thanks for the prompt response.  I am merging the Dolphin SCI High Speed
interconnect drivers into 2.2.18 and 2.4.0 for our M2FS project, and I 
am reviewing the big ugly nasty patch they have current as of 2.2.13 
(really old).  I will be looking over the 2.4 tree for a more clean 
manner to do what they want.
What's in the patch alters the /proc filesystem, and the VM code.  I will
submit a patch against 2.2.19 and 2.4.0 for this support for their SCI 
adapters after I get a handle on it.
:-)
Jeff
