I'd like to be rid of it inside the command for various reasons:  every
command has one of these, and they're expensive in the allocation (at 96
bytes).  There's no reason we have to allocate and free that amount of
space with every command.  In theory, the number of these is bounded at
the queue depth, in practice, there's usually only one, and this DMA
alignment issue does requires most drivers to double copy.
