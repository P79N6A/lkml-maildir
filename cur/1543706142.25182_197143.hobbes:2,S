Probably not, just use the in-kernel call, and be done with it.  If you
_really_ want to share code between userspace and the kernel, keep a
different version of it somewhere else.
Why do you want to run your code in both places?  Does this mean that it
doesn't even really need to be in the kernel as it works just fine in
userspace?
thanks,
