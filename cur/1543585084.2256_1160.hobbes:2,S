You must pretty much avoid using signal handlers with pthreads.
In stead, you need to carefully setup things such that most signals
are blocked in most threads and a single thread (or selected set
of threads) does a sigwait for signals of interest.  Most good
pthreads books talk about this issue, as does the DCE documentation.
