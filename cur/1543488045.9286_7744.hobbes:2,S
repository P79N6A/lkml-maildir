My original message is following.
---------
Is there any patches for supporting union mount file system in Linux?
I have used union filesystem with  FreeBSD 4.4, and now have a problem
of server switching to Linux from FreeBSD.
I know that Union mount filesystem in BSD is highly dependent on a
feature of the stackable file system. I am understanding VFW interface
in Linux is not stackable, is it right?
