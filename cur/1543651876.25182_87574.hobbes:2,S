Subject: setup.S unterminated #ifndef and gcc 3.3

Is anyone else trying to use gcc 3.3 to compile the later kernels?  I'm using gcc 3.3 to try to compile 2.5.46 and get:
	arch/i386/boot/setup.S:298 unterminated #ifndef
	make[1]: *** [arch/i386/boot/setup.o] Error 1
	make: *** [bzImage] Error 2
I haven't seen anything on the list about this so am assuming that I'm either alone in trying this, or there is something not quite right with my configuration.
Any thoughts anyone (I know the one about using gcc 2.95.3 ;- ) )
Cheers
Kevin
