Correct, and I came to the same conclusion ; Chris told us he booted with
the "nosmp" option. I've checked his config, and he has CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT=y.
I've just tried the same here, and I confirm that my machine (dual athlon)
does not boot with "nosmp" unless I also add "acpi=off". Mine even stops
ealier, while scanning IDE devices.
So now we're back to the original problem, i.e. why does he get bad pmd
that often on 2.4. It leaves us with the following possible next steps
after the problem occurs again (if it still happens with 2.6.14 or if
Chris is OK for a few more tests) :
  - 2.4.32 nosmp acpi=off       => the easiest one
  - 2.4.32 + aic7xxx+20040522   => the more interesting one
Regards,
Willy
