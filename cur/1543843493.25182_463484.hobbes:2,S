With kprobes one can place probes anywhere you want but the ones placed 
in the middle of the function are not maintainable because they are tied 
to a location in the code.  Having a NOP leaves a maintainable address 
that we can hook into when needed. 
AFAIK writing a portable code for using local variables is not easy 
without using DWARF information, hence we don't handle that in kprobes. 
Jprobes is a special case where you can have access to function 
arguments at the function entry point. SystemTap can be used to specify 
probes anywhere in the function and local variables can also be used in 
the probe handlers. The problem still is maintainability as probes are 
specified using line numbers.

Once we have these static markers one can use both dynamic probes and 
static probes intermixed getting best of both worlds as Frank 
demonstrated in OLS.
Here are couple of proposals that were discussed in the systemtap 
mailing list in how to specify static markers, we could use these ideas 
with the rest in deciding on a maker proposal.

For placing probes at the begin and end of function we don't really need 
markers as function boundary works as a marker.
I think we only need markers in few places where an important decision 
is made in the middle of a function.
