I think you think I mean the shell script is GNU too. I mean the shell
script replaces GNU too, which is why it could be a while before you see

That sourcecode I posted is for my assembler in Bash, osimplay. Some
people think it's funny. Personally, I think 64k of asm("") in Linux is
funny.
"Let's face it. C sucks." Alan Cox, puctuation added by me, obviously.
Unlike Alan, I did something about it. And like C, I have no use any
longer for Alan.
