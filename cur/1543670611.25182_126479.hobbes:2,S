Stop this thread, we are arguing with god.

IBM DMVS18V (SCSI)
Maxtor ATA133 160 GB DiamondMax Plus.
Maybe they _should_, but I can tell you they in fact sometimes don't (IBM very,
very seldom, Maxtor just about all the time)

How do _you_ know that? What makes _you_ argue for what _I_ think is useful and
_my_ sense of security? You are on thin ice ...

Interestingly I owned one of those 30 MB MFM Seagate howling drives back in the
80s. I had no errors on it until I threw it away for its unbelievable noise
rate. Today I throw away one (very low-noise) disk about every week for
shooting yet another fs somewhere near midnight.
Indeed we moved on, only the direction looks sometimes questionable ...
