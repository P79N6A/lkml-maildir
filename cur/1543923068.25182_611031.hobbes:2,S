Yes - the user level code can have different defaults too.
I was discussing what should be the default kernel API.

Well, that would justify keeping this choice per-task.  I tend to
agree with that.
But that doesn't justify having to specify it on each system call.
In another reply David recommends against supporting Choice A at all.
I'm inclined to agree with him.  I'll reply there, with more thoughts.
But if we did support Choice A, as a backwards compatible alternative
to Choice B, I'd suggest a per-task mode, not per-system call mode.
This would reduce the impact on the API of the ugly, unobvious, modal
flag needed to select the optional, non kernel default, Choice B
semantics.
I still have low confidence that you (Christoph) and I have the same
understanding of what these Choice A and B are.  Hopefully you can
address that, perhaps by briefly describing these choices in your words.
