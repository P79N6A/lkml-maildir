Hmm, I suspect there is other issue: alloc_new_reservation should not
repeatedly allocating the same window, if ext2_try_to_allocate
repeatedly fails to find a free block in that window.
find_next_reservable_window() takes my_rsv (the old window that he
thinks there is no free block) as a guide to find a window "after" the
end block of my_rsv, so how could this happen?

alloc_new_reservation() reserved a window with free block, when come to
the time to claim it, it scans the window again. So it seems that the
range of the the scan is too small:
        p = ((char *)bh->b_data) + (here >> 3);
        r = memscan(p, 0, (maxblocks - here + 7) >> 3);
        next = (r - ((char *)bh->b_data)) << 3;
		--------------------->   next is -1
        if (next < maxblocks && next >= here)
                return next;
		----------------------> falls to false branch
        here = bitmap_search_next_usable_block(here, bh, maxblocks);
        return here;
So we failed to find a free byte in the range.  That's seems fine to me.
It's only a nice thing to have -- try to allocate a block in a place
where it's neighbors are all free also. If it fails, it will search the
window bit by bit. So I don't understand why it is not being recovered
by bitmap_search_next_usable_block(), which test the bitmap bit by bit?

Hmm, if the error is it prematurely think there is no free block in the
range (bitmap on disk), then even in ext3/4, it will not bother checking
the jbd copy of the bitmap. I am not sure this is the cause that ext3/4
may not has the problem.

Because grp_goal is -1?

I agree with you that the double check is urgly. But it's necessary:( If
there to prevent contention: other file make steal that free block we
reserved for this file, in the case filesystem is full of reservation...

The "i<7" loop there is for non reservation case. Since
find_next_usable_block() could find a free byte, it's trying to avoid
filesystem holes by shifting the start of the free block for at most 7
times.
Thanks!
