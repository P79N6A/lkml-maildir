hm, this patch is a NOP, so it's weird that it has an effect.
Do you have serial logging enabled perhaps? If the following WARN_ON() 
triggers:
+               WARN_ON(p->prio < rq->rt.highest_prio);
then perhaps that can cause a 5-10 seconds delay. (that's how much time 
it takes to printk a warning on the slowest serial settings)
but if you use suspend, then any such printks would be preserved in the 
dmesg, right? If the WARN_ON() triggers, and if you remove it, do things 
get faster?
this does have the feel of being scheduling related, but are you 
absolutely sure about the precise identity of the patch? It's not the 
next patch or the preceding patch by any chance? (which would also be 
scheduler patches)
