I can not let this comment stay like that. I have an AMD X2 4400+ Dual Core 
running Gentoo and now kernel 2.6.21-rc3 with RSDL 0.30 (HZ=300).
Up till now whenever I wanted to watch a movie i had to stop compiling with 
more than one task for the movie to run without skips. When playing games i 
have to renice the game (-15-) or else it would get 'choppy'.
With the new RSDL i compile packages with -j3 (reniced to 15), my wife lets up 
to 8 computations (scientific computations) running at the same time and the 
game and a movie still run without any visible flaws. The only thing i saw 
till now was that the mouse cursor was a little less responsive and scrolling 
in firefox took a little longer. But amarok for music, the movie in mplayer, 
the 3d game, everything went smooth though a load of > 11. This all without 
even renicing anything but the compiles. With mainline kernel already 
watching a movie with this load was impossible.
I used the staircase scheduler before RSDL but even with staircase such 
overload was not possible while watching a movie.
Mike, maybe use higher nice levels for your encoders or just use one. Or maybe 
scheck your memory, i guess if the memory bandwidth is too low there's no 
scheduler which can foresee such thing and react accordingly. Since you have 
a HT system it's just one physical ALU, so everything has to be squeezed onto 
this one ALU, up to a certain degree it works, but not forever. And the lame 
encoders i suppose won't wait that very much and long for their data to get 
delivered from memory so they'll utilize the ALU quite a lot.
Con, continue your scheduler development as it helps many cases which were not 
possible otherwise. I'm amazed of the ability of the scheduler to handle a 5 
times overloaded system without too much hazzle.
Great work Con.
Dirk.
PS: Con, don't stress your neck too much, your health is the only thing you
