I've already fixed that in my tree.

Not if done right. You CAN still do them differently, but I changed a few
drivers to not have a single #ifdef MODULE, and I hope it takes off. 
The fact is, that modules and non-modules _are_ going to be subtly
different, but we can make the differences as small as possible.
I'll make a pre-4 so that you can comment on some of the modules (look at
"binfmt_elf.c" for example).
