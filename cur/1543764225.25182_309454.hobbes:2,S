Just verified that without TT mode enabled, 2.6.11-bk7 tree compiles (when
CONFIG_SYSCALL_DEBUG is disabled) but does not run if when compiled TT mode
was disabled. I've verified this with a clean compile (I had this doubt),
 both with static link enabled and disabled. Sample output:
./vmlinux ubd0=~/Uml/toms.rootfs
Checking for /proc/mm...found
Checking for the skas3 patch in the host...found
Checking PROT_EXEC mmap in /tmp...OK
[end of output]
2.6.11 works in the same situation (both with static link enabled and
disabled).
I'm investigating but busy with other stuff, however there are not many
patches which went in for this release.
Jeff, any ideas?
