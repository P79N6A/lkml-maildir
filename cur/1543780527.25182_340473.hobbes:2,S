Intents are meant as optimisations, not replacements for existing
operations. I'm therefore not really comfortable about having them
return errors at all.

It could be dropped. The reason for putting it in is that some parts of
the VFS may restart a path walk operation if it fails (see for instance
the ESTALE handling).

Why do we want to keep this behaviour? It is undocumented, it is
non-posix, and it appears to do nothing you cannot do with the existing
access() call.
Are there any applications using it? If so, which ones, and why?
