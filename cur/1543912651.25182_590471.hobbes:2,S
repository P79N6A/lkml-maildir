grrrrrrrr ... i already made my point in my earlier post.  i'd
really, really like it if *this* attribute remained as "maturity".  an
entirely *separate* attribute could be defined as a feature "status",
which would be entirely orthogonal to maturity level, so that the
above would be written as
	maturity OBSOLETE
	status BROKEN
there's a reason for this -- any feature should have exactly *one*
value for any attribute.  that is, in terms of maturity, a feature
could be EXPERIMENTAL *or* DEPRECATED *or* OBSOLETE.  it ***can't***
be more than one, as in both DEPRECATED *and* OBSOLETE.  to allow that
flexibility is to descend into absurdity.
