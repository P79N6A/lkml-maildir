I don't expect new CD-ROM interfaces to come that often. However...

Depends what you mean. If you're saying you have:
/dev/hdc
/dev/sr0
/dev/sr1
/dev/sr2
/dev/sr3
...
as with the existing system (open(2)ening each entry to see if there's a
device there), I don't think that's neat. You're better off
hard-coding /dev/sr%d and putting in a loop, for example.
However, if you're saying that the config file has:
/dev/ide/cd
/dev/sr
/dev/usb/cd
and each entry is treated as a directory to be opened, then I have no
problem with that. I don't care if it's hard-coded into the
application or if there is a configuration file. The important thing
is that devfs provides a device-type and interface-type grouping that
makes things very neat and simple, and you don't need to speculatively
open(2) each device entry to see if there is hardware behind it.
