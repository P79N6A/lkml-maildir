So we have a section of blocks around the middle of the blockgroup which
are used for indirect blocks.
Presmably it starts around 50% of the way into the blockgroup?
How do you decide its size?
What happens when it fills up but we still have room for more data blocks
in that blockgroup?
Can this reserved area cause disk space wastage (all data blocks used,
metacluster area not yet full).
The file data block allocator now needs to avoid allocating blocks from
inside this reserved area.  How is this implemented?  It is awfully similar
to the existing reservations code - does it utilise that code?

hm, system time variance is weird.  You might have found an ext3 bug (or a
cpu time accounting bug).
Excecution profiling would tell, I guess.

They're large files.  It would be interesting to see what the numbers are
for more and smaller files.

Less speedup, for more-and-smaller files, it appears.
An important question is: how does it stand up over time?  Simply laying
files out a single time on a fresh fs is the easy case.  But what happens
if that disk has been in continuous create/delete/truncate/append usage for
six months?

We can get onto that later ;)
