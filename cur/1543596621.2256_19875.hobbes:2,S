I am able to crash 2.4.3 kernel on a dual Pentium 500 with 256 MB RAM and no 
swap space with the program below. to compile, gcc -o oom oom.c -lpthread
Found out that my magic SysRq for some reason was not working :( so I could  
not get much detail - will fix the magic and report more when it becomes 
available. I have observed three types of behavior:
* once the program locked everything up ( test run from X), the machine did 
not even ping. However, after some time ( about 5 minutes), the machine 
became functional again 
* another time, there was a complete lockup ( again in X), I waited 10 
minutes, nothing happened, so I just rebooted
* then I tried the test after a clean boot - this time no X, just plain 
consoles - after the run I actually got the shell back, could not type 
anything. I could switch between virtual consoles, type my username at the 
login prompt, but would never get the password prompt. The machine pinged, 
and I could even connect to ports that had services, but got no response 
after a successfull connect. My explanation is that the kernel ran out of 
memory, but could not clean up.
The only relevant thing I could find in syslog is messages like this:
Jul  6 17:33:31 mysql kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 25500 (oom).
Jul  6 17:33:35 mysql last message repeated 84 times
Jul  6 17:33:35 mysql kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 25501 (oom).
Jul  6 17:33:35 mysql last message repeated 5 times
Jul  6 17:33:35 mysql kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 25502 (oom).
Jul  6 17:33:35 mysql last message repeated 263 times
And last but not least - the whole reason for writing the program below was 
to create a simple test case and isolate the problem in a real life threaded 
application that left some unkillable ( even with -9 ) processes after 
running out of memory and getting killed itself. So I suspect I have 
accomplished my goal of creating unkillable process, which is what, 
apparently, makes it so difficult for the kernel to recover from the stress. 
Note that I had to get the process stuck in I/O to cause the problem - 
without the I/O the kernel kills all the bad guys and recovers gracefully.
So let's hope this is enough info to track down the bug - if not let me know 
what else is needed.
