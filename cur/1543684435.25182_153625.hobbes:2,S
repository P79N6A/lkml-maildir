From an newbie:
How about having a dir for each available module created earliest moment
in boot process, (point where depmod is done now I guess).  Each dir has
files 'options' and 'load'.  then you could:
# echo "io=0x300 irq=11" > /proc/mods/ne2000/options
followed by
# echo "1" > /proc/mods/ne2000/load
Of course, I am probably missing the point or something :-(
