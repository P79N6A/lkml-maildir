	You should not be using the kernel headers to compile glibc.

	The running kernel should not be in sync with glibc.

	Right, there is no reason they should.

	It creates a stable system. Things become much less stable if you mess
around with all of userspace just because the kernel changes. There is no
reason user space should be in sync with the running kernel. User space
should be stable.
	The later the kernel headers you use in user space, the less compatability
you will have with earlier kernels. A program compiled with 2.4.26 header
files should work with 2.6.x, but not vice versa. When new kernel interfaces
are added, the old ones are retained to keep compatability with user space,
but programs compiled against the newer headers may fail to work with older
kernels that lack the newer interfaces. Of course, user space programs
compiled against the older kernel header files can't get the advantages of
the newer interfaces.
	The kernel-user interface is supposed to stay stable, so you shouldn't need
to make significant user space changes when you upgrade the kernel. Only
specific applications that need to get specific new features that require
changes to the kernel-user interface need to change. It has been a very long
time since compiling user space programs against the header files for the
kernel you happened to be running was considered good practice.
