Not interested in hacking on something like that onto it. It was more of an 
experiment in the simplest possible starvation free design that still 
supported nice levels.

While this may be the key, it is not the reason we aren't getting maximum 
roundness in our designs in linux. Our major enemy is cpu accounting of work 
done in kernel context on behalf of everyone else. Putting architecture 
dependant hooks into the assembly code to account for entry and exit would be 
the accurate way of doing this.
