One more comment to the scrollpoint issue: if they haven't fixed it 
after 4.3.something XFree throws away all scroll events where the scroll 
amount is more than 1. So "fast scrolling" is already unreliable, this 
patch just made it work somehow instead of what it's doing now: not 
working at all.
