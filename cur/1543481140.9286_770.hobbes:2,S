I was actually going to change it to "The Linux development community," since
there's no "official" development team for the kernel, although there are
prominent developers (e.g., several of the people on this list).

Press releases are intended to be brain candy, not technical masterpieces.  This
is one of the reasons I advocate a shorter, simpler release -- overkill on the
technical details derails the primary message of the release, that being that
there is a major new version of the Linux kernel available.  If they want the
details, they can watch the 11 o'clock news. =)

I don't like repeating "the" too many times in the same space.  "the hallmarks of
the Linux kernel" sounds awkward.  I agree (if that was your intention) that
"traditional" is somewhat redundant with "hallmarks."  I'll think about it.
"...long been hallmarks..." perhaps?  Still a bit redundant.

"supplierS."  But point taken.

I'll give the URL for the GPL, instead of the FSF's URL.  The main reason I did it
this was was so I wouldn't have to link deep into the FSF's site.

I agree with dropping "primarily."  I don't agree with dropping "series of,"
because Debian is not the same operating system as RedHat, for instance. They both
use much the same software, but they are fundamentally different.

You've got the "press release voice" down, I'll tell you that. =)  I still like
"operating," because "server system" sounds awkward.

Yeah, though the URL I have is rather long.  A shorter one may be in order.

Well, what I'm really trying to say is that the system is good both for hackers
and for regular home and office users.  I suppose the hackers already know that,
so pitching the command line to them is not necessary.
However, I disagree with the notion that many on this list have that UNIX is a Bad
Thing(TM).  UNIX is a good thing, IMO.  UNIX is part of what makes Linux so
powerful, and so fun.  With GNOME/KDE and LinuxConf, eventually, the details will
be hidden to all but those who want to see them.  That's one of the advantages
over Windows: the ability to get dirty with the OS if you want to.
The only argument I'd have for keeping the word "UNIX" out of the release is that
it's a trademark owned by TOG, but if we reference the trademark, I don't see a
problem.

I disagree the next line is a great swipe at MS. =)
Just kidding.  From working at Digital for two summers, I know that the single
biggest thing that annoyed me about Windows NT was the fact that for EVERYTHING,
you had to reboot the system.  Change a driver; reboot the system.  Change a
setting; reboot the system.  Install an APPLICATION; reboot the system!  It seems
this is an annoyance that others have noticed and it would be good to capitalize
on it would specifically trashing Windows.
> OK - but should have been footnoted already.
Yes, but it's a nice way to end any release.  That's part of the "release voice,"
if you will. =)
Okay, so my revised version follows.  Still needs some work. =)  I am keeping the
subject the same, so people with killfiles can continue to ignore this.

**** DRAFT **** PRESS RELEASE - LINUX KERNEL 2.2.0 **** DRAFT ****
**** FORK 1 **** DRAFT 3
Linux kernel version 2.2.0 released
Contact: Somebody
Office: Somewhere
Email: Something@Somedomain.SomeTopLevel
SANTA CLARA, C.A. -- The Linux developers community has announced the
release of a new version of the Linux kernel.  This update brings
multiprocessor scalability and broad support for newer hardware, while
maintaining the stability and reliability that have long been
hallmarks of the Linux kernel.
Among the new features of the 2.2.0 kernel are **BLAH** [Something
needs to be added here that doesn't sound like Microsoft doublespeak.]
The update is now available from the Linux Kernel Archive
(
http://www.kernel.org/
).  Linux system vendors will begin shipping
systems using the new kernel in March.  Business users will be able to
obtain the update from their regular suppliers.  As always, the Linux
kernel is distributed as Free Software under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (
http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
).
BACKGROUND -- "Linux" is the common name for a series of operating
system distributions based on the Linux kernel and software from the
Free Software Foundation's GNU Project.  Linux is available for most
popular computer architectures, including but not limited to x86,
Alpha, PowerPC, MIPS, and Sparc.
Since the Linux kernel was created in 1991 by then Finnish university
student Linus Torvalds, Linux has grown to an installed base estimated
at more than 15 million users worldwide.  With a 212% growth rate in
1998, it is the fastest growing server operating system.  Among the
advantages attracting users are:
 * An open development model, which enables any user to modify the
   operating system components and submit patches to the official
   distribution.  This both facilitates the development of new
   features and enables users to repair problems within hours after
   they have been located.
   (
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar.html
)
   [Damn, isn't there a shorter URL for this somewhere?! =) ]
 * Usability.  Linux has advanced graphical user interfaces, providing
   ease of use for home and office users while maintaining the power
   versatility of the command line.  [This REALLY needs work, now.]
 * Stability and reliability.  Linux machines have been known to run
   for years without rebooting, and in most cases, only kernel
   replacements -- not application installations -- necessitate such
   action.
 * Maturity.  Linux is modelled after UNIX, an operating system with
   proven stability through nearly thirty years of research and
   development.
Microsoft engineers Josh Cohen and Vinod Valloppillil, in a
competitive examination of Linux (Halloween Document,
http://www.opensource.org/halloween.html
), write that "Linux
represents a best-of-breed UNIX, that is trusted on mission critical
applications, and - due to its open source code - has a long term
credibility which excedes many other competitive operating systems."
