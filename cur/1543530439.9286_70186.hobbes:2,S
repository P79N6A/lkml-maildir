IF the limits established for 200 users is 5 MB then the system will NOT
OOM. The additional load would not be permitted to start. No current processes
would be aborted.

Almost no overhead other than administration. The only overhead is subtracting
from the available size of the users allocation. Once that limit is reached,
the USER gets a resonable signal, and only the USERS process would be
terminated. This has worked quite well in the past, and work quite well on
current systems with user resource limits. The only time OOM is valid is IF
management directs that oversubscription of memory/swap is going to be
tolerated; when the crash occurs then the responsible party is clearly
identified. The Kernel/OS is not at fault.

The system wouldn't run out of VM. Only users would run out of their allocation
of VM. The system would not have a problem with this.

Overcommit is the symptom of the problem, not a solution. OOM crashes and
random program aborts are the problem. User resource controls are the best
known solution.
I have seen both happen on any system from an IBM 360 to Cray T90. If swap is
oversubscribed, then it can crash (or deadlock). The systems that best
handled resource allocation have been: DEC VAX/VMS, Cray UNICOS. The worst
has been SGI IRIX and Linux (nether even tell you if you are OOM; other
than by random crash...).
I want controlability, and repeatabiltiy. If the system runs out of memory
I want a message stating that occurance. Even more, I want resource controls
that will allow me to be able to eliminate it (most draconian) or permit
it within certain limits; and to know when it happens.
