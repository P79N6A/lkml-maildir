But all I'm saying is that while there are equivalent magnitudes of
interrupts off regions in mainline, there is little point introducing
a hack like this to "solve" one of them.
Sure, rework one of them nicely to solve the issue for that case, or
hack _all_ of them (not for mainline but for your specific RT system).
But hacking just one does not make any sense.
Just because this one path actually _triggered_ due to a silly
benchmark doesn't make it any more valid. I think it shouldn't be too
hard to cause similar or worse latencies with the mmap_sem rwsem using
the same number of threads.
If anyone is running hackbench 20 on their sound mixer, then they
deserve to have overruns.
