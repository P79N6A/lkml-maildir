All I could find was:
    * avoid multiple prefixes (which was the least important guideline
      in instruction selection)
    * avoid using multiple segment registers (the pentium M only has one
      level of segment register renaming)
    * avoid prefixes which take the instruction length over 7 bytes
None of these apply to the use of %gs to access PDA.
Most of the discussion about prefixes is in avoiding the 0x66 16-bit prefix.
