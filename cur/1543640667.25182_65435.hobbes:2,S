Subject: Archive hunt for vger's lists ...  (and FAQs too!)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/8/21/77

At vger's web we have:
  
http://vger.kernel.org/vger-lists.html
which has all lists at vger, and links to all list archives that
I found last week (at google/marc) when I did a full review of those.
If you know any archive that should be listed there, please tell
vger's webmaster.  (NOT the lists!)
Also, if any list has a FAQ, we would like to know about it too!
My plan is to add archive and FAQ pointters to all list footers
(in style similar to linux-kernel).
