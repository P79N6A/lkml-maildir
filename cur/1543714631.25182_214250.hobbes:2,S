Ok.  This makes sense now that you explain it.

And akpm has just explained why it can be avoided in the hugepage
case.

Well, I'm attempting to understand the hugepage code across all the
archs, so that I can try to implement copy-on-write with a minimum of
arch specific gunk.  Simplifying and consolidating the existing code
across archs would be a helpful first step, if possible.
