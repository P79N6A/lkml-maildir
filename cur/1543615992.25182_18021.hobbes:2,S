This is in fact something that I've had planned for devfs as well: a
/dev/bus hierarchy.

Well, devfs itself doesn't lay things out, it's the drivers that do
this. My plan is to have /dev/scsi/host# become a symlink to something
like /dev/bus/pci0/slot1/function1 (a directory).
It still eludes me why a new device FS was developed when devfs
already has the mechanisms that are needed.
