I'm still not sure that's a really good rationale for bootmem2.
e.g. the non continuous nodes are really special cases and there tends
to be enough memory at the beginning which is enough for boot time
use, so for those systems it would be quite reasonably to only 
put the continuous starts of the nodes into bootmem.
That said the bootmem code has gotten a little crufty and a clean
rewrite might be a good idea.
