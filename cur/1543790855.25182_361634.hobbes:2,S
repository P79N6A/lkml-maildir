We're not talking about /dev/random, we're talking about /dev/hw_random 
which is read by rndg and then fed by userspace back into /dev/[u]random.
Clearly, there are cases (e.g. VIA) where rndg or a library called from 
rngd could just as easily have done the extraction in userspace, and for 
that, it makes no sense to force it to do it in the kernel.  For some, 
it could be done either way, and for others a kernel driver is clearly 
needed.  Integrating them all into /dev/hw_random was probably a 
mistake, though.
