Do these behave differently? In particular, do the IDE Zip drives hide
the partition structure...

Well, you may also see firmware and/or design flaws in the drive
(personally, I have never trusted iomega, because on the CeBIT fair in
Hannover, I once asked them "why should I prefer iomega ZIP or JAZ over
SyQuest" and they had no answer except "we're just better". I later
heard complaints about the SCSI ID only to be chosen from 5 or 6, 25-pin
SCSI connectors and stuff, then there was the click-of-death sabotage
and now there is your "partition entry or not" problem.)
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/zip/zip-1.html
 has some info which does
not look too promising when you're after consistent behaviour across the
various drive types (interface-wise, that is).
Judging from what's on that page, the IDE driver seems to know it's just
a "floppy" without partitions, but the USB driver sees the (fake)
partitions.
