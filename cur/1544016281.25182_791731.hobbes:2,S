Thank you for your reply, Roland. Unfortunately, this continues
happening after having installed the most recent version of the BIOS
available from Dell.
I understand this is a problem in the BIOS and not the kernel, but is
there a way to have the kernel work around this bug in the BIOS and
make that memory accessible? Eg,
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/linux/kernel/991748#991748
The difference seems to be that the BIOS on this machine I am using
does list 8GB memory available.
Thanks for any help,
James
