Just to follow up a bit.  People writing apps that run at SCHED_FIFO know
that they aren't getting hard real-time, and they are OK with that.  If they
wanted something more they'd run on RTLinux.  Why would it be wrong to preempt
the SCHED_FIFO process in the case, assuming that it is too hard to fix a broken
design that doesn't allow the necessary kernel threads to run on any CPU?
