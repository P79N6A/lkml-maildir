Hi Marcelo !
FYI, I tried to compile everything with gcc 2.95.3.
I applied Juan's patch to sdla before. It mostly 
consisted in modules, complemented by a
not-too-fat kernel. I got the following results :
  - 928 modules that compile correctly
  - pcilynx still doesn't compile ("num_of_cards"
    and "cards" definitions have been removed)
  - sm_afsk{1200,2400,4800} don't compile
Among the 928 modules, some don't resolve their
dependencies :
   - comx still references proc_get_inode(). I had an
     old fix fot that, but IIRC the whole driver
needed
     a global lifting anyway
   - pcihpacpi references acpi_walk_namespaces
     which it cannot find if
     CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_ACPI=m.   OK if =y.
Didn't try to boot on it yet.
Cheers,
Willy
