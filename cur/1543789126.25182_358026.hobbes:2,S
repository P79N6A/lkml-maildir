Or,  you bite the bullet and fix /proc/mounts and let distributions bind 
mount /proc/mounts over /etc/mtab.
Sun recognized this as a problem a long time ago and /etc/mnttab has 
been magic for quite some time now.
Add to this the fact that a textfile /etc/mtab is busted because it's 
whitespace seperated and pieces blows up and you do things like:
mount filer:/export/mikew "/home/Mike Waychison"
