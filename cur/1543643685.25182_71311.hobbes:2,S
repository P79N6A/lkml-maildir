If I'm reading this correctly, I have been trying:
[root@stimpy mark]# dd if=/dev/sda of=tmp/tmp.img skip=50 \
bs=1k                                                                                                         dd: reading `/dev/sda': Input/output error
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
Then the output of dmesg:
SCSI device (ioctl) reports ILLEGAL REQUEST.
SCSI device sda: 16384 512-byte hdwr sectors (8 MB)
sda: test WP failed, assume Write Enabled
 sda: I/O error: dev 08:00, sector 0
 I/O error: dev 08:00, sector 0
 unable to read partition table
 I/O error: dev 08:00, sector 96
I have altered skip from 25 - 100 and received the same errors, except
the sectors change in size with relation to altering the skip size.
This may be the wrong way of running the command, if so I'm sorry for
wasting peoples time on that.
Mark
