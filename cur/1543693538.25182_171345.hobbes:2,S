Hi,
I'm seeing repeatable freezes in all the 2.6 test kernels and also in
2.4 kernels > 2.4.20.  It is reproducible simply by mounting an NFS
volume (hard or automount) and doing a 'find' on it.  The whole system
will then intermittently freeze for several seconds.
The server is a Slackware system kernel 2.4.21-xfs, export options are
(rw,no_root_squash,sync), the client is Debian unstable with any of the
above kernels.  The protocol version is v3.
Cheers,
Steve
