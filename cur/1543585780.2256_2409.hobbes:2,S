No that's not true! Read the code please. The result is a simple
wighted sum without artificial unit.

That's only a matter for the "smooth" anglosaxons. Different
cultures have different measures on this. I don't feel the need
to adjust myself to the american cultural obstructivity.
I esp. to the habit of don't saying clearly what one means if one
want's to criticize something.

No that isn't true.  I esp. the behaviour will be predictable.

You misunderstood me compleatly. I wasn't using an running oracle
db as a test case. I was using the INSTALLATION process.
Since you apparently don't know about oracle I will tell you:
It involves a lot of different applications. Infact TONS of:
Java, shell, compiler, linker, apache, perl and whatanot.

I would like to state: The current heuristics DON'T serve us well 
on desktop boxes...

I was testing on a NOTEBOOK.

That's true for sure.
