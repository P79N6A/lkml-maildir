Yeah, it would be a lot simpler. Try telling that to Linus. :-(

The higher bits are absolutely required.
There are ways to push the work of doing a 64-bit counter out into the
proc filesystem and a timer that goes off every 31 bits worth of time.
I've posted an explanation before; you may search for it if you like.
