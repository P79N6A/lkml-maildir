You can already compile them in all. The functions are not really
conflicting -- otherwise allyesconfig would not work.
I think his goal was to get an prefix that describes the module uniquely.
gart_* clearly does not fulfill that criteria.
So basically he's replacing an ambigious-with-other-IOMMU-implementations
prefix with an ambigious-with-AGP prefix. Seems like a rather pointless
change.
