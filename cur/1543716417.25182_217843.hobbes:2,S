Yes, I was wrong. It was not race with descriptor closing. It was my looking
at agetty which broke things: if you do not watch logout, login prompt
will come up immediately.
Problem is even more stupid: agetty will not come up while you are watching
that terminal. It opens /dev/console so it has some handle on which it
can issue VT_OPENQRY, but if you have /dev/console configured to use just
currently visible tty, it finds itself using that tty (daca4000 is tty3's
tty and da9c4000 is tty2's tty).
Another problem with this is that some daemons do not detach from tty you
start them on - currently vmnet-natd is one I catched (but it was first
daemon I looked at, so there can be other too). So when you do
'/etc/init.d/vmware restart' on some tty, that tty will not come back after
logout until you'll kill vmnet-natd (I'll fix that ASAP).
And third problem is that agetty's loop around VT_OPENQRY has small problem:
When agetty finds that some tty below one it needs is not opened, it opens it.
Later it finds that tty it wants is busy - so it calls error(), but without
closing lower ttys, which are now kept opened during 10 seconds timeout in
agetty's error(). This effectively blocks all lower-numbered agettys from
their terminals until this one succeeds (or until it is stopped by init).
