David,
Sorry for being dense - but I don't see the problem in using
a spinlock to implement xchg(). The example algorithm looks broken.
Or am I missing something obvious here?

producer() looks broken. The problem is two producers can race and
one will put the wrong value of list->head in elem->next.
I think prepending to list->head needs to either be protected by a spinlock
or be a per-cpu data structure. consumer() should be ok assuming the code
can tolerate picking up "late arrivals" in the next pass.
Or am I missing something obvious here?
It's worse if producer were inlined: the arch specific optimisers might
re-order the "elem->next = list->head" statement to be quite a bit more
than 1 or 2 cycles from the xchg() operation.
thanks,
