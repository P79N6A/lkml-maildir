I'm running linux-2.2.17pre13, and when doing a large recursive copy
across two partitions on the same hard-drive, a huge slowdown will occur
after 40-50 seconds.  Initially, every goes well; transfers speeds are
good and system CPU usage is low.  After this initial time, system CPU
time becomes >90% and drive throughoutput becomes almost non-existant.
The following is the output from vmstat, set to 2 second intervals.
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system         cpu

In case its not obvious, the slowdown happens between the 2nd and 3rd
lines.  Has anyone else run into this problem?
