Ben,
Sorry about that, we have had some back and forth on this on the ppc 
embedded list.
Not sure I understand your concern about the duplication of the fast 
exception return path?  Jason's patch pretty much just moved code out 
of head.S into fpu.S so we dont duplicate it between head.S and 
head_44x.S & head_fsl_booke.S
