Not sure who the Alpha kernel guru is lately (nothing pertinent in
MAINTAINERS), but:
A 2.2.17pre12 kernel built as Cabriolet-specific will not boot from the
SRM console on my AlphaPC 64 (aka Cabriolet).  And, yes, I did check the
option for starting from SRM.  It doesn't even machine-check, just loads,
decompresses and dies silently with an Error Code = 6, falling back to the
console prompt.
When configured for generic, it works fine.
