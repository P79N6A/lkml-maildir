I just tried 2.4.19-ac2.
On booting, when it hits the IDE stuff, I got:
hdc : Lost Interrupt
hdc : Lost Interrupt
hdc : Lost Interrupt
hdc : ATAPI 48X DVD-ROM ....
Then it gets a bit further:
scsi : Aborting command due to timeout : pid 30, scsi2, id 0 lun
0
inquiry 00 00 00 ff 00
(This looks to be my cd burner on hda - ide-scsi)
Then it loops on this continuously. I had to write out the above
by hand,
because it never gets to the point where it mounts my scsi drive
rw.
2.4.19-ac1 seems to work fine. (As well as all the ac series
from the past
4 weeks)
To avoid wrapping I stuck my lspci output and .config at the
following urls:
My .config file is here:
http://ac.marywood.edu/tspin/www/dotconfig.txt
My lspci -vvv is here:
http://ac.marywood.edu/tspin/www/lspci.txt
I am running a stock RedHat 7.3 system. 
gcc version 2.96 20000731
modutils 2.4.19
make 3.79.1
binutils  2.11.93.0.2
util-linux 2.11n
If I have done something stupid, let me know.
Thanks!
Tony
