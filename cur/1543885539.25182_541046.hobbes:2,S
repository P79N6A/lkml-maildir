Mark,
Gave this a spin on my SS20 today, have the console on the
serial port. No problems seen. You will need to provide a
signed-off-by line to get it accepted upstream, see 
Documentation/SubmittingPatches.
ffd60050: ttyS0 at MMIO 0xf1100000 (irq = 44) is a zs (ESCC)
Console: ttyS0 (SunZilog zs0)
ffd60050: ttyS1 at MMIO 0xf1100004 (irq = 44) is a zs (ESCC)
ffd60130: Keyboard at MMIO 0xf1000000 (irq = 44) is a zs
ffd60130: Mouse at MMIO 0xf1000004 (irq = 44) is a zs
Cheers,
Martin Habets
