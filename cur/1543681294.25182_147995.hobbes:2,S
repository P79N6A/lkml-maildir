Me too !!, now :-)
Zwane pointed me correctly to a devfs problem, and actually was the
AUTOMOUNT_DEVFS feature that was giving me problems, gentoo tries to
mount it too, when it was already mounted.
I guess is time to go to 2.6-test
My system is running perfectly, the only thing I dont like right now is
that my quickcam modules cannot be compiled on 2.5, i will try to fix
that, or test the old 2.4 module on 2.5
Thanks for ur comments Patrick!
Max
