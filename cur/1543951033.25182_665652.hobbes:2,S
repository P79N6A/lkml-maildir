...meanwhile, I have tried to change (as suggested in another thread) the 
timeout value in the following line:
(void)handshake(ehci, &ehci->regs->status, STS_ASS, 0, 1500);
Makes no difference. Neither introducing additional delays to provide 
safety margins at several other loci helped a bit. Any idea what to try 
next?
Also, does anyone have a VT6212L datasheet? Unfortunately, Google haven't 
found it for me.
Thanks
