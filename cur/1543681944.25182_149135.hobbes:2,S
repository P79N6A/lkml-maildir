I have some patches to improve synaptics kernel support. One of the
patches makes the touchpad behave better together with swsusp. The
patches are available here:
        
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/patches/touchpad/2.6.0-test1/v2/
I also see the USB problem, but I think this is already a known issue.
Vojtech, the swsusp patch in the patchset I sent you a few days ago
had some problems, so if you haven't applied those patches yet, I
suggest you apply these new patches instead. Otherwise, I can create
incremental patches for you.
