Yup. I usually compile new kernels with spinlock debugging.
Looks like a number of the ioctls in oss/audio.c have locking problems.
At least the following ones look buggy:
SNDCTL_DSP_SETTRIGGER
SNDCTL_DSP_GETIPTR
SNDCTL_DSP_GETOPTR
SNDCTL_DSP_GETODELAY
Each of these tries to manipulate a spinlock through the uninitialized
dmap pointer. SNDCTL_DSP_SETTRIGGER actually operates on both dmap_in
and dmap_out. It should presumably acquire locks for both.
Looks like a copy/paste error, probably a result of a hasty conversion
cli()/sti()'s to spinlocks.
