Hi,
whatever the implementation is, at some point there must exist an interface go get 
and set "normal time", free of any jumps and jitter. That "frontend time" will be 
used a a base of correction. Basically that means time should be as monotonic and 
jitter free as possible for any measurement interval you like.
Otherwise when extrapolating the time-error, it (NTP) will try to overcompensate 
(or undercompensate), making the whole thing instable.
Here's a sample from some ancient NTP distribution (pre-nanosecond), but you'll 
get the idea what to check:

 * gettimeofday() and, finally, writes out the time values for later
 * analysis. From this you can determine the jitter and if the clock ever
 * runs backwards.
