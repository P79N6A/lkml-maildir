/sys/power/disk is for deciding how to do suspend to disk. 
shutdown = do it with the in kernel code
platform = do it with the BIOS code

Yes, but in rc3 the merge between pmdisk and swsusp1 happened. 
It basically has totally changed between rc2 and rc3. 
So, looks like that setting is right. 
So if you wait until it's done writing out pages and hard power it
off, does it resume? 
Does it work if you boot with: 
acpi=off
