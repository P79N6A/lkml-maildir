Because of the seeking. The data is being swapped out in chunks but these
are not linear chunks in swap

BSD has madvise() but Linux doesnt yet have this facility.
One thing you might want to do is to bump up the swap cluster size if you
are using 2.2.x. You can do this via /proc/sys - see Documentatuon/proc.txt
Tuning these values should get you a lot closer to the disk speed
