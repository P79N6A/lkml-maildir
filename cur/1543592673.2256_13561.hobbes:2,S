For what it is worth, in the recent postings I made about this topic, you
suggested that it was bad cabling, I swapped the cabling, same problem.
I swapped the mother board from Abit K7T to ASUS A7V and all cables worked
fine.
I really think there is a software problem in there with certain chipsets,
those from VIA seem to be problematic.
