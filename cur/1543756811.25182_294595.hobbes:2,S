No, IOMMU is now off, too. And I have always used nv_agp with:
Option      "NvAgp" "1"
If the nvidia driver detects the kernel agpgart, it doesn't load nv_agp 
with a big message in the kernel log.
I've just short tested it again:
Doom3 with medium standard settings in 800x600@24bit:
agpgart: 58,1 frames
nv_agp: 63,1 frames
Its a lot in Doom3.
(Simple) 2D test 1280x1024@24bit with x11perf --> 
http://www.marcush.de/bench/
Same gcc, xorg 6.8.2, 2.6.11-rc3-bk8 kernel, patched (minion.de) 6629 
nvidia drivers to run with newer 2.6.11-rcX kernel,... here was only 
nv_agp and agpgart the difference. In the past without an patched driver 
the same difference.
And again using agpgart with GNOME under X and moving this thunderbird 
mail window or other bigger ones like mozille or firefox over an 
gnome-terminal pulls/draws a ca. 5cm shadow like field slowly after the 
main window. It seems so not fast enough writing to the screen, when 
moving. With nv_agp its really faster and you do not see this.
Bad english... I know. ;)
Greetings,
Marcus
