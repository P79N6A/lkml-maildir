It is a BUG() check to see if there are cases where the interrupt
handler
is being set (re armed) while it is currently set for another event.
if (HWGROUP(drive)->handler != NULL)
     BUG();
ide_set_handler(drive, handler, timeout, expirey);
If we are reloading the handler but it was set but something else ,
never
called during a completion, and/or is dangling.  It is a typo my bad :-(
Edit and change it from "==" to "!="
Apology for the typo folks.
