   You mean I do "ln -sf /dev/urandom /dev/random" ?  Nah... ;)
   Several people sent me a private email sugesting to use urandom instead,
   but it's not what I use, it's about what all software on the machine uses.
   Should I patch SSH? Should I patch SSL? Or are they using urandom anyway?
My recommendation has always been that applications use /dev/random for
long-term public key generation, and to seed a pseudo-RNG for session
keys.  The reasoning behind this is that true, high-quality random
numbers is a very precious resource (even with a real high, quality
random number generator, it is still a limited resource), and so it's
better to periodically get randomness from /dev/random, and then use
that as seeds for a cryptographically secure, pseudo-random number
generator.
