POSIX ACL's sit defined in a withdrawn POSIX spec (1003.1e).  The API
doesn't specify the fs/vfs level detail (other than supporting, user,
group, other and mask acls), and gives a userspace API for accessing
the ACL info (with simple functions like acl_get_file() which you should
find in libacl and can fit many os level implementations).  Not sure it
helps much.
