I'd be quite surprised if 400,000 word/sec of memory bandwidth can
explain a 15% time difference, especially considering all the other
things that are done to communicate over a pipe (wakeups etc).
Btw, I have seen variations of that magnitude in other network tests
that I've done that _appear_ to be explained by small changes to the
code like that, but the next day or week the variation stops
correlating with the change.  Page colouring affecting benchmarks
again?
