The problem is that if we find a device, a new SDpnt is allocated,
*SDpnt2 (SDpnt in scan_scsis()) is set to the new SDpnt, so
after scan_scsis_single() returns, SDpnt->scsi_level is 0, not
the value of the just found device.
The fix sets lun0_sl to the newly found devices SDpnt->scsi_level,
not to the newly allocated SDpnt->scsi_level.
