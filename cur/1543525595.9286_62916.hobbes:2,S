Alan,
I am the culprit that created this whole absolute block mess with my 
extension to the loop transfer module API in kernel 2.1.130.  I was trying 
to implement a strong encrypting filesystem for my own use.  Strong defined 
in terms of resistance to cryptanalysis and minimizing information available 
to opponents (such as number and sizes of files, access timestamps, etc,
all of which are visible in file based schemes like CFS).
Prior to 2.1.130 ECB mode was the only option.  Cipher block chaining 
(CBC) (known as cipher-driven codebook within the NSA and elsewhere) 
having unique IV's per block is a "must have"... anything less is not worthy 
of the implementation effort, imho.
I considered and rejected passing relative block numbers to the transfer 
modules for use as IV seeds.  The last thing I wanted to see was 
duplication of ciphertext on my disk drive (occurs when multiple looped 
filesystems exist on the same drive using the same cipher and key).  
Such duplication at minimum is "interesting" to the cryptanalysis, and 
at worst facilitates recovery of plain text.
Many of the Linux community consider loop.c to be broken.  Astor in his 
kerneli International Crypto Patches favors relative block, as does 
Al Viro in this thread...  and I too acknowledge that relocation of backing 
files, in all its flavors, is desirable in some environments.
That said, there remain the exemptionally paranoid among us who need 
access to absolute block numbers as IV seeds.  Speaking for myself, 
I have no concern adding bmap logic to my own transfer code.  
Al's patch seems reasonable.
