About bug reports, isn't a good thing introduce the sgi's lkcd (linux kernel crash dump) into the main stream of 2.5? The main problem of lkcd in 2.2 was the lack of kiobufs.
I think it as a good thing, for distributions, the distribution guys have the vmlinuz image of the distro, so when a bug happens the user only needs to send the crash dump to the distribution kernel hacker, and he can discuss the bug on lkml.
This introduce a new kind of bug reporter, if the distribution makes avalaible every new development kernel as a package, a user can download and use, crash and report the bug without any knowledge about kernel. So the marketing guys can say: 'help the development of linux without hacking, report bugs'.
