I considered a .h, but I didn't see one that all drivers included. I
declare it in the 3 separate driver .c files that I saw needed it. There
is no pm.h and I didn't see the point in creating one just for that.
That of course will work if everyone likes that better. In either case,
you still have to add something to all three files.
