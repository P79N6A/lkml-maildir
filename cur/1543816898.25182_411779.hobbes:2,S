Subject: [PATCH 0/7] UML TLS support [for 2.6.17]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is UML support for TLS, which allows one to fully use NPTL glibc,
finally, on a 2.6 host (either x86 or x86_64). This has been happily tested by
many users and by us for some times and we've now fixed all known bugs, and
tested with different glibc's. So this code can IMHO be merged finally.
