OK.  I found a good candidate in the Apple HFS module.  Although I only have
it compiled "just in case" and don't use it, possibly some
filesystem-probing stuff has it loaded.
Unfortunately, the fact that it is insmod telling this results in no
messages in the logs...
Adrian: you're listed as HFS maintainer - could you please take care of
adding that module information ?  (my appologies if it's done in 2.4.19rc)
