Hello experts,
I have a question: In a kernel modification I dynamically add some data 
structure that is referred to by using the "disc_data" member of the tty 
structure. My question is: is it safe to do that (I'm using a new magic number 
of course), or can some other code just replace my reference? If it's not 
safe, how would I correctly do that?
Any pointers to written (up to date) online documents are OK...
Regards
Ulrich
