3c590, 3c900, 3c905, 3c575 - they all have hardware support for Tx and
Rx checksums - UDP and TCP.  Many other NICs do as well.
Linux uses the hardware checksum on receive, but not on transmit.  The
cost of doing the Tx checksum is small compared to the cost of the
mem->mem copy, which is performed at the same time.
