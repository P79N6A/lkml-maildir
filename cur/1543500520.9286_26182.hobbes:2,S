I sent you an email already, but maybe you missed it. Here is the relevant
part again, just one function, and no crappy "three return values"
breakage. The function returns an error value, nothing more.

No, the way to fix fullpage is NOT to change bmap.
Please don't change bmap at all. I want to get the other stuff fixed - if
we leave a !blocknr assumption for now that's fine: I just didn't want to
=continue= the assumptions in new code.
If you do change bmap, then it should be changed to just be the same as
fs_get_block() - ie it passes in the bh, so that the low-level filesystem
can directly set the BH_Allocated flags etc. You then change the "update"
flag to fs_get_block() to be a real bitmap of flags, something like
        FS_GETBLK_UPDATE - clear the block if new
        FS_GETBLK_ALLOCATE - allocate a new block if needed
        FS_GETBLK_SINGANDDANCE - do a little song while we're waiting
see?
Then you can wrap the old bmap() calls (only used by the magic ioctl's
after this) to do something like
        struct buffer_head dummy_bh;
        memset(&dummy_bh, 0, sizeof(dummy_bh);
        if (!fs_get_block(inode, block, &dummy_bh, 0))
                return dummy_bh.b_blocknr;
        return 0;
Simple..
