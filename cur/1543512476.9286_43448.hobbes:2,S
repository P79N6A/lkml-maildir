Not so -- the driver is always determined by some number of
left-associated bits (like an IP route); ideally it should always be the
major number.
I am proposing a 32/32 split (with a 12/20 split for NFSv2), because
glibc already is using a 64-bit dev_t.  Adding thousands of modems
therefore is not a problem, and I believe it would be very hard to
construct a scenario at which this will not be sufficient for a very
long time.
