Hello List,
In my quest to get 2.6 running on my shiny new laptop I've run across problems 
with radeonfb. In kernels < test5 i would get nothing at all, in test5 i get 
a garbled screen.
Is there any updated driver that can be tried to solve this?
I've been looking through the archives but unable to find anything useful.
Jan
