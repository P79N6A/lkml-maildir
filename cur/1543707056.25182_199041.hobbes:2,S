Athlon 2800+
Via KT400 chipset (ABIT KD7, I believe)
WD1200JB (Western Digital 120gb)
3ware 7000-2 as RAID1
Latest Red Hat 2.4.20-?? kernel
My wife's computer has the ABIT board with the KT333 and the same drive, 
but not RAID.  SiSoft SANDRA reports 39 megs/sec for writes to an NTFS 
volume.
Right now, I'm thinking the bottleneck may be the 3ware.
