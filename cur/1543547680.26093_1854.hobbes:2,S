The origin of this comment was related to a comparison of the
MSM/TSM/CSM layer in NetWare and Linux.  I've already said that Alan's
code handles fast paths well and from what I've seen is comparable to
NetWare.  The areas I saw where sideband cases and issues of fragment
re-assembly.          It's as good as what's in NetWare.
