Hi,
When a process dumps core, the do_coredump() initiates the core
file generation. Is this operation synchronous(does the kernel
wait for core to be completely written to disk) ?
Basically, if I have the parent process waiting for exit of
child which dumped core, can the parent access the core immediately
on receipt of "child exit" message ? Is it possible that the
core is still in the process of being written ? If so, what's
the event the parent needs to wait for to be assured of a complete
core.
Thanks,
Ravi
