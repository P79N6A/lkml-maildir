Hi,
Same area...
ext2 has the ioctl() EXT2_IOC_SETVERSION.
This allows _any_ user to set an inode's "version".
Unfortunately, in the case of ext2 directories, inode->i_version seems to
be used for consistency checks if operations sleep. Hence, allowing users
arbitrary write access to this value could be used for mischief.
I would suggest that setting of this inode attribute should be limited to
privileged users.
More detailed analysis of what could be done with this is welcome.
Cheers
Chris
