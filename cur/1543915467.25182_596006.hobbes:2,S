__GFP_NOFAIL should only be used when we have no way of recovering
from failure.  The allocation in journal_init_common() (at least)
_can_ recover and hence really shouldn't be using __GFP_NOFAIL.
(Actually, nothing in the kernel should be using __GFP_NOFAIL.  It is 
there as a marker which says "we really shouldn't be doing this but
we don't know how to fix it").
So sometime it'd be good if you could review all the __GFP_NOFAILs in
there and see if we can remove some, thanks.
