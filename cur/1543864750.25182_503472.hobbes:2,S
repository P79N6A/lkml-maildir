If one does the equivalent of 'iwlist eth1 scan essid myssid', then a probe response with
NETWORK_EMPTY_ESSID set in the network flags will have 'myssid' returned in the SSID field of the
returned buffer. If the input command were 'iwlist eth1 scan', then an empty SSID would be returned
under the same circumstances. My code saves the SSID that is in the extra argument of the
SIOCSIWSCAN call, and uses that in the SIOCGIWSCAN call.

I can think of one instance where the wrong value could be reported. That is if some other STA
probes a different hidden AP just when we have sent a probe request. For WPA this should not cause a
problem as wpa_supplicant will sort that out while authenticating.
What is the method that should be used to associated with a given hidden AP?
