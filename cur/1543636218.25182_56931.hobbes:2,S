They are not buggy merely inconvenient. The reality of the NFS protocol
makes it the only viable way to do it

I can't think of a case I'd disagree

If you don't check the return code it might not detect anything. If you
do check the return code it might detect something. In fact you
contradict yourself IMHO by giving the NFS example.

The use of intelligence doesn't help. Come on I know you aren't a cobol
programmer. Check for -EBADF ...

Disagree. It says
It is quite possible that errors on a  previous  write(2)  operation 
are first  reported  at  the  final  close
Not checking the return value when closing the file may lead to silent
loss of  data.
       A successful close does not guarantee that  the  data  has
       been  successfully  saved  to  disk,  as the kernel defers
       writes. It is not common for a  filesystem  to  flush  the
       buffers  when the stream is closed. If you need to be sure
       that the data is physically stored use fsync(2).  (It will
       depend on the disk hardware at this point.)
None of which guarantee what you say, and which agree about the use of
fsync being appropriate now and then
