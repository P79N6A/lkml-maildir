Hi:
Any weeks ago I asked about problem with
program mke2fs. I asked why mke2fs hanged
the system (2.2.5-15) from install program
in a 4 MB machine (with 16 MB swap memory).
Alan Cox answered "its a VM 2.5.5 problem". Well ,I
have increased the RAM memory (up to 8 MB) but I
obtain the same problem: mke2fs hangs the system
with big partitions (no very bigs partitions: 10,
20 MB ...) with 3 MB partiton mke2fs works correctly
(I am using a execl function to run mke2fs).
With 8 MB memory mke2fs uses swap, so I obtain the
same problem?
Really is it a 2.2.5 kernel problem?
With 2.2.14 kernel (for instance) my installation
program would work?
I have not probed a higer kernel because I have any
compiled drivers (I have not sources) for 2.2.5-15 kernel.
I don't know if it's a kernel problem or a install program problem.
(I have a 4MB machine with RedHat 6.2 with 2.2.5-15
kernel and mk2efs work fine with partition over 100MB???)
I don't understand.
Any idea?
