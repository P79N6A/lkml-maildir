An ispell filter seems a simpler approach to me. (ispell -F
filter) I use that (shown here to head off requests) for
email so quoted content is ignored.  A similar filter for C
source would make this trivial.
$ grep ispell .muttrc
set ispell="ispell -F maildequote"
$ cat bin/maildequote
#!/usr/bin/perl
while (<STDIN>)
{
        /^[>|] / || /^On .* wrote:$/ and tr[A-Za-z][_];
        print $_;
}
print "\004";
