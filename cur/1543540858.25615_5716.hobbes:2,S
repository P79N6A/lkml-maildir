   However, you don't want to write a program that prints out the offsets, since
   then you are prohibiting building Linux with a cross compiler.
If you are clever you can make it cross-compilable with some shell
script hackery, see arch/sparc64/kernel/check_asm.sh and the
check_asm rule in arch/sparc64/kernel/Makefile
