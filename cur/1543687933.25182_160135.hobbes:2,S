I would agree, it's probably too much to change this late in 2.6.  Eventually 
(2.7) I think we should revisit this and try for a more unified approach.

Looks good to me.  One other thing your patch fixes:  Once in a while we 
called load_balance in rebalance_tick with the wrong 'idle' value.  
Occasionally we would be on an idle_node and idle_cpu rebalance tick, the 
idle cpu would [possibly] pull a task, become non-idle, then we would call 
load_balance again, but still have idle=1 for the intranode balance.
