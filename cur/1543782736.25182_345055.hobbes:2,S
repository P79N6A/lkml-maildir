I thought the limitation on SPDIF was normally that most decoders only
support 2 channels of PCM, except for a few multimedia speaker systems
which support 3 pairs of PCM streams at the same time to support digital
out on some sound cards.
Most digital decoders do support AC3 of course and sometimes also DTS
both of which of course support encoding more than 2 channels.
So really I think it is just a problem of what standards the receivers of
the digital data know what to do with.
As for volume settings, I always try to keep the sound card mixers at
around 75 to 80% since it seems most amplifiers and mixer do distort a
bit when you max them out.  Why would you want them all at 100% anyhow,
then you might as well not have mixing control for the seperate audio
channels at all.
