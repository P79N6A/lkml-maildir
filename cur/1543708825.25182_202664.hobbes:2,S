This was just for completeness reasons. Why being able to copy onto the
stack but not to create on the stack. It doesn't have to be on the
stack. Assuming you want to handle a lot of context and use a mempool.
You might want to have your structure and a tfm to the end of that
structure so they are allocated together. Yes, you could also create a
kmalloc'ed tfm once and copy it to every other structure. Perhaps that's
not even so bad, because in my implementation there is one problem:
You have to know the size of the structure before initializing it. So
the user might change the underlying module why querying the size and
initializing the structure. Hmm. That can be dropped if it doesn't make
sense.

I've added methods for copying the tfm context because it will fail very
badly for everything that has a pointer in the private context.
Use-after-free and these things. Ugly.

Hmm. It should be there, but could return -EOPNOTSUPP. Copying a
compress tfm doesn't make much sense. We need a way to detect things
that are bad in a generic way, everything else is hacky.
