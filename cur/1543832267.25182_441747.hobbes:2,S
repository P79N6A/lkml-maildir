Not sure what's the 15/..., but here's the content:
% cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6

stepping        : 5

coma_bug        : no

BTW, speedstep worked fine on my laptop with 2.6.12-rc5-git5 and
earlier.

Well, is there some way of doing a bisection over these changes? As far
as I know, the problem probably affects all Dell D600 owners, probably
others.
