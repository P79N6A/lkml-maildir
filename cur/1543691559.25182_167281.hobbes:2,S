Well I do wonder whether it is just a very buggy BIOS etc not being helpful.

It isn't entirely obvious from the PCI dumps; I think its the 8235 from the
first entry for the device:
Bus  0, device  17, function  0:
  ISA bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8235 ISA Bridge (rev 0).
Bus  0, device  17, function  1:
  IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586A/B/VT82C686/A/B/VT823x/A/C PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 6).
    Master Capable.  Latency=32.
    I/O at 0xdc00 [0xdc0f].
Bus  0, device  17, function  5:
  Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8233/A/8235 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 80).
    IRQ 5.
    I/O at 0xe000 [0xe0ff].
ALSA seems to think its an 8235.

Nod - I've heard it play a few times; so I'm wondering about a loose cable; although
my normal solution of these problems (buy a Soundblaster) has failed when I got the
machine home to find it had a sticker over the back of the case saying if I opened
it I'd break the warranty.
