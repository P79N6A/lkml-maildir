A lot of the known bugs have fixes which appear to be OK, but haven't
really had enough testing to go in to a -final tree.  A lot of them
won't have been tested on SMP boxes for example.
What _would_ be nice would be to have a -$firstinitial$lastinitial
tree that opens up once we get in to the -rc phase - a kind of
'alternative rc' if you like, which collects all the patches that are
rejected for the official -rc tree.  That gives the maintainers one
last chance to prove the validity of their patch :-).
Or, to look at it other way, it would be effectively carrying on the
-pre phase during the -rc phase:
E.G. 2.4.22 development could look like this:
            2.4.21-final

     2.4.22-final    to be perfect.
