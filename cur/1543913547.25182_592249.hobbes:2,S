The patch is based on the workaround codes that have been added after
2.6.23.  Thus the patch cannot work for 2.6.23 or earlier.

We do have different branches, too.  Most fix patches are usually in
the branch to be pushed (although they are rarely done).  But, the
point is that I am no official subsystem maintainer.
I have an access right to add the patches to ALSA HG tree, which is
converted to git tree automatically.  So, eventually, 90% of patches
come from me.  But, the maintenance of git tree and push request are
out of my hand.  It's a frustrating situation to me, too.

I'm skeptical that people ever test stable rc kernels well for certain
bugs.  Also, adding new PCI ID isn't as safe as it sounds (like in
this case).  It must be tested _before_ applying.

Well, the problem is how we can find out such unlucky guys...

Linux will suck really if one breaks so-called stable thing easily
without actually testing.  For stable stuff, "it should be good" isn't
enough.  It must be: "it IS good."
Don't get me wrong; I'm for stable patches.  What I'm telling here is
that we have no systematic way to find testers for certain patches on
old kernels.  (Actually, a fix for a core stuff is often much easier
to test.  But a fix specific to a certain hardware is harder to test.)
