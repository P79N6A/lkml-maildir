It will be fine on 2.4.17-rc2 as well. The patch is localised to
devfs, and there are no devfs changes between 2.4.17-rc2 and 2.4.17.

Are you sure you mean "then devfs trys...", or perhaps you mean "when
devfs trys..."? If you actually mean "then", that implies that there
are two things trying to create a duplicate cache. One of them being
devfs (which is fixed in the patch I sent you), and the other is some
random driver. It would be good to know for sure.
