urandom is more useful, because can't be implemented in user space at
all. /dev/urandom will use the real randomness from the kernel as a seed
without depleting the entropy pool. How does your /dev/prandom device
compare to /dev/urandom performance-wise? If it can be made to use
the same input data and it turns out to be significantly faster, I can
see some use for it.
