Hmm, that little change worked a lot better. However thoughput is down to
700kb/s! Transferring files from the other machine to this machine is much
faster - 868kb/s.
In the logs, I only got *one* message from the natsemi driver (and this
happened when sending files from this machine to the other machine. No
problems receiving from the other machine.
Dec 25 17:28:12 tahallah kernel: eth0: Something Wicked happened! 0583.
But I just realised that the other machine I'm using has an 10 megabit
ethernet card (on the hub that one is shown on 10, my machine is shown as
100). I think this explains the throughput problem. When I get another 4
way power socket, I'll put my other machine (which has a 100 megabit card
in it) on the network and see if that makes a difference.
Cheers,
Alex
