I don't really see why this has to be in the kernel, even after reading 
your text below. This would be code which a tiny number of users would 
find useful, someone in the future might find exploitable, to perform a 
function which can be done in user space.

So to save cost on your end you want to make this feature part of the 
mainline kernel. Am I misreading your intent here?

Which make a good argument for doing asymmetric anyway, it would seem. 
That way any updates can be checked off the target machine and validated 
as authentic.

Having said all this, we have a boatload of other crypto in the kernel, 
if it's just the crypto module, like aes, anubis or micheal_mic, and is 
GPL compatible, some people may agree. But if this is an embedded 
system, and you have the patch, why not just apply it to your kernel and 
forget mainline?
