i should also mention that yesterday's tree passed 200 randconfig bootup 
tests on 32-bit and 64-bit x86. (i excluded CONFIG_WMI from ACPI, plus 3 
other ACPI commits because they keept crashing boxes or broke the build)
Today's kgdb updates are in the trivial category so i'd not expect them 
to break anything, but nevertheless, out of caution i threw the latest 
tree into the qa mix as well and they already passed 10 randconfig 
bootup tests.
[ and this matches my experience with KGDB stability in the last few
  months while we carried and tested it in x86.git: even the old, much
  wider-scope and uglier/riskier patches that hooked in a lot of places
  never broke anything unrelated (or anything in fact) - and this
  matches kgdb's -mm track record as well. ]
