Ok here are the contest results on the SMP machine with the read latency 2 patch
(rl2) and my 3 line disk latency hack (dlh) which almost disables the elevator
on vanilla 2.4.20:
io_load:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.4.19 [5]              162.3   45      28      19      4.48
2.4.20 [5]              164.9   45      31      21      4.55
2.4.20-dlh [3]          47.3    157     0       1       1.31
2.4.20-rl2 [3]          101.8   76      19      22      2.81
io_other:
Kernel [runs]           Time    CPU%    Loads   LCPU%   Ratio
2.4.19 [5]              62.3    117     11      20      1.72
2.4.20 [5]              89.6    86      17      21      2.47
2.4.20-dlh [3]          45.0    159     0       1       1.24
2.4.20-rl2 [3]          51.8    142     10      21      1.43
Note no mention of throughput here - but implied drop off with dlh! My guess is
the drop in throughput with dlh is much worse during kernel compilation than
when the machine is idle. Nonetheless the dlh hack makes a significant
improvement in responsivenss under IO load on a desktop.
