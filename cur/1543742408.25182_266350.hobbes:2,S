It doesn't say anything about esp being specially treated by the 
underlying hardware as far as I can see. Thus either you know details 
about the cpu not being publically available or you're speculating about 
  undocumented features.
Some more data from said manual (lea is better on P3 and the same as add 
on P4):
Instruction	Latency		Execution Unit
ADD/SUB:	0.5		ALU
POP		1.5		MEM_LOAD,ALU
Now, a P4 had two ALUs (Ports 0 and 1) but only one MEM_LOAD Unit (Port 
2). So after all you will be stalled more likely by an additional pop 
instruction than by lea/add. I don't know about P4 internals but let me 
make some guess: There's lot of software around that needs to run on 
older processors where lea has quite some performance advantage. Thus I 
would guess that the P4 design respects this by handling lea x(esp),esp 
efficiently.
If you still believe in features I can't find any manufacturer 
documentation for, well, you're Linus so it's your decision.
