No, I thought of this - in menuconfig I use this:
[*] Virtual terminal
[*]   Support for console on virtual terminal
Moreover the exact same kernel boots in another notebook (P-II, 333 Mhz, 144MB 
Ram) - I simply put the 2.5'' Harddisk in the other Laptop.
Anyway, I'll try the following:
1) Try to get more RAM ( + 8MB, 12MB should be enough - but maybe I'll never 
get this IBM specific DRAM-cards for this old laptop.
2) Kick out ext3 - this could save more memory
3) Try init=/bin/sh and "swapon" manually
4) Use an older or memory optimized kernel
Booting with "mem=4" will probably also help with testing.
Many thanks for your helpful replies!
