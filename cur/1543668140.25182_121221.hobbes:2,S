yes, this one was my only suspect, but it should really never cause any
problems. We might change sleep_avg during the wakeup, and carry the
requeue_waker flag over a preemptible window, but the requeueing itself
re-takes the runqueue lock, and does not take anything for granted. The
flag could very well be random as well, and the code should still be
correct - there's no requirement to recalculate the priority every time we
change sleep_avg. (in fact we at times intentionally keep those values
detached.)
