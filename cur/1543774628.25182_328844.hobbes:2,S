I'm *quite* aware of what your preconceived notions think it *should* be.
Maybe the two examples I asked for have *real-world* meanings that you should
be allowing for.  Like, for instance, on a mail server, where the A/V software
may need to unzip a file 5 or 6 times to find out if there's malicious content.
Or seeing if it's a ".zip bomb", where a small .zip will decompress to gigabytes.
Or I'm testing a new compression algorithm, to see if multiple compressions help
(yes, I know that it *shouldn't* help - but I've seen real-world cases where the
algorithm could only look at a 4K or 8K window at a time, and if you hit a *very*
long run of duplicate 4K segments, a second compression would compress all the
identical or near-identical "this is a 4K chunk" tokens...)

Oh, I'm waiting for the fun the first time somebody deploys a plugin that
has similar semantics to 'chmod g+s dirname/' ;)

I think you're highly deluded as to just how much or little performance gain
this will get you. Model what happens with a kernel 'make' on a 256M machine
with and without all that zipping and compressing, and assume that a constant
48M is available for caching of the linux-2.6.12/ tree.
