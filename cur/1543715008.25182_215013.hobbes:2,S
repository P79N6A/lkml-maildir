Sure. Both drivers handle it. The w83267hf driver is prefered if the
chip is found on the ISA bus, however the w83781d is the only one that
can handle the chip if it's on the I2C bus.
For a list of supported chips for each driver, you can take a look at
the comments in the headers of the source files.
