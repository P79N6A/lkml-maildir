ioremap() only makes sense on a IO bus basis - it's entirely possible (and
even probable) that it doesn't make sense to any sbus drivers.
As such, any drivers you compile on sparc32 wouldn't use it anyway, so it
not being there is not a problem.

Entirely possible. You might want to talk to the PPC people.

This is WRONG!
If that is indeed the case, then what _should_ happen on PPC is:
 - ioremap() does nothing:
	#define ioremap(x,y)	((void *)(_ISA_MEM_BASE + (unsigned long)(x))
 - readX/writeX: probably just do something like
	#define readb(addr)	(*(unsigned char *)(addr))
but in NO case is your approach correct, and you should really complain to
the PPC people if using ioremap/readb doesn't work.

Drivers that care about endianness should probably do the conversion
themselves.

No, they should not. The driver should use ioremap().
In short, the current setup is correct, but PPC may be seriously broken.
Not my problem, I only care about the design being ok.
