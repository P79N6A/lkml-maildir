The advantage to dmraid over mdraid or lvm is that with dmraid you can 
use the bios support to boot directly from the raid.  Another advantage 
is you can dual boot with windows on the array.  With lvm or dmraid you 
have to have a plain single disk boot partition to bring the system up.

You can do this in either configuration.  If you configure the drives as 
a raid array using the bios/dmraid, then you can still plug them into 
another controller and dmraid will happily recognize them exactly the 
same way; you just won't be able to boot from the array.
