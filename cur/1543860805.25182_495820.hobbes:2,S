It seems that the "acpi=noirq" (and probably also the acpi=off) case
is simply an additional broken case, not a success case to compare to.
The thing we really want to compare is dmesg and /proc/interrupts
from 2.6.19-rc6-git12, and the broken current release.
Perhaps you can put that info in the bug report when you file it.
thanks,
