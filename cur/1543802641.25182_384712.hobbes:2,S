Andi,
While testing this I ran into another problem with same symtoms. If 
I compile my kernel for physical location greater than or equal to 
16MB then only BP boots and applicatoin processors don't come up. I had
noticed this problem in i386 and posted a patch. Here is the similar  patch 
for x86_64.
Though the symtoms are same but this does not seem to be related to the
problem which Stephen is facing as he seems to be compiling the kernel
for 1MB location only.
Thanks
Vivek
o This fix was posted for i386 long back. Posting it for x86_64.

o This patch fixes the problem of secondary cpus boot up. This situation
  is faced when kernel is built for non default locations like 16MB and
  onwards. In this configuration, only primary cpu (BP) comes and
  secondary cpus don't boot.
o Problem occurs because in trampoline code, lgdt is not able to load the
  GDT as it happens to be situated beyond 16MB. This is due to the fact
  that cpu is still in real mode and default operand size is 16bit.
o This patch uses lgdtl instead of lgdt to force operand size to 32
  instead of 16.
