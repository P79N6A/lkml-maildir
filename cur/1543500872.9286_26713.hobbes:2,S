Hallo,
let me add my observations, will hopefully help to narrow down the case.
I've seen the mouse madness as well, on several Dual PPro/200 machines
(but no X crash so far).
This started after I upgraded
from  Redhat-4.2, kernels 2.0.3x-SMP
to    Debian-2.1 (with XFree86-3.3.2.3a-11)
      kernels 2.2.{4,9}-SMP (compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3!)
Started using NFS (via user nfsd and autofs) at the same time.
No changes in hardware at this point.
I'm always using the XF86_S3 driver.
All my kernels are SMP, so no information on UP.
Greetings,
Burkhard Bunk.
