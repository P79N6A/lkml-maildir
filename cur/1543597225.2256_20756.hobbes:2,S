It varies a lot with workload.  With large writes such as 
'iozone -s 300m -a -i 0' it seems about the same throughput
as ext2.  It would take some time to characterise fully.

yes - lots of short writes (eg: mailspools) will benefit considerably.
The benefits come from the additional merging and sorting which
can be performed on the writeback data.
I suspect some of the dbench benefit comes from the fact that
the files are unlinked at the end of the test - if the data hasn't
been written back at that time the buffers are hunted down and
zapped - they *never* get written.
If anyone wants to test sync throughput, please be sure to use
0.9.3-pre - it fixes some rather sucky behaviour with large journals.
