And do after this modification last longer?
Hm, I use the cdrom very seldom in this PC, as Lionel Bouton pointed out
some K7S5As had electrical failures... I thought about PowerSuplly
already, threw this though away because there is only
The Motherboard
cdrom (hardly used)
512MB RAM
3 HDDs
old intel AGP Graphics Card, never used.
connected.
Can a bad Powersupply or weak mainboard create Uncorrectable Errors on
HDDs? Again only a question to experience of this community...
So should I buy a new board or a new Powersupply...
