Hi Alan, 
Jens Axboe told me that the Yamaha drive is not a DVD drive, but a
CDRW.  I checked, and he's right. I also checked my correspondence
with the person reporting the Yamaha drive. He clearly implied(*) to
me that he had a DVD drive, but didn't get it working in the end.
Just delete the line with the Yamaha / GHOST entry, get "V5" of the
patch from 
http://www.bitwizard.nl/dvd/scsi_dvdram_patch_v5
 , or ask
me for a resend. 
			Roger.
(*) I.e. he was careful not to SAY that he had a DVD RAM drive, but he
sent mail under a subject of "DVD-patch"...
