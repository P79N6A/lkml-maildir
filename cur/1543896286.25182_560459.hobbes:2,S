You could reconstruct the block in question from all the other blocks
(including parity) and see if that differs from the data block read
from disk...  For RAID6, there would be a number of different ways to
calculate alternate blocks.   Not convinced that it is actually
something we want to do, but it is a possibility.
I have that - apparently naive - idea that drives use strong checksum,
and will never return bad data, only good data or an error.  If this
isn't right, then it would really help to understand what the cause of
other failures are before working out how to handle them....
