If in your opinion it looks good... Again, you are forcing the policy
decision on a lot of interfaces. For no good reason, AFAICS.

Sigh... Sure, but so is the magic way to get ioctl descriptor by file
descriptor. They are two separate files. End of story. Yes, they are
related - provided by the same driver.
Look, emulating ioctl(2) via write(2) is _not_ the goal. We will have
to keep that syscall, for binary compatibility reasons if nothing else.
We can start fixing the applications that use Linux-only ioctls (and
that pretty much means that we'll have to leave the networking ones alone
for quite a while).
What _is_ interesting is a sane API that could be used instead of the
current mess with device ioctls. There's only one reason to go for
fs/n/ioctl scheme - mass conversion of applications with little to
no thinking. Not going to happen. Simply because you'll need to switch
arguments in many of these cases.

And your ioctl is different from that because...? I can certainly see
good reasons to restrict user to some subsets functionality provided by
ioctls - BTW, one more reason why multiple related channels are good.
