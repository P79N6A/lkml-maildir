Subject: [patch 0/6] lightweight robust futexes: -V3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is release -V3 of the "lightweight robust futexes" patchset. The 
patchset can also be downloaded from:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/lightweight-robust-futexes/
Changes since -V2:
Ulrich Drepper ran the code through more glibc testcases, which 
unearthed a couple of bugs:
 - fixed bug in the i386 and x86_64 assembly code (Ulrich Drepper)
 - fixed bug in the list walking futex-wakeups (found by Ulrich Drepper)
 - race fix: do not bail out in the list walk when the list_op_pending 
   pointer cannot be followed by the kernel - another userspace thread 
   may have already destroyed the mutex (and unmapped it), before this 
   thread had a chance to clear the field.
 - cleanup: renamed list_add_pending to list_op_pending. (the field is 
   used for list removals too)
