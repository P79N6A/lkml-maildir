I'd really wish people would use examples other than a single player to 
generalize the performance of the kernel. For all you know xmms's 
decoder for the type of music you listen to could be written unoptimally 
to put it as nice as possible.  If all players and different types of 
pcm audio decoders are skipping in the situations you experience then 
that's different, but i hardly think that will be the case as it is not 
with me nor, ever has been that i can remember (maybe in early 2.3.x).
