Hm, this is of course getting very philosophical, but: you must have a very bad
feeling in everyday life, if I take your words serious. How can you cope with
the fact that basically _every_ ad ever published is a _lie_ to a certain
extent. Does this make you angry, too? How can you life with that? Ads do
nothing else but disguise the fact that something should be sold and make
someone real rich. And most of the things sold are really ridiculous stuff
nobody ever needs. Some is even harmful to people, and still they buy it (e.g.
drugs). Emails are only a mirror of The Real Life (tm).

Yes, plain and simple: yes.

Hm, I am not quite sure if I get what you like to know, but how about:
_learning_ ??

Maybe, maybe not. I tend to think we are both on a road heading in a direction
we both do not know, maybe we meet each other sometime, I can't tell. I guess
your picture of the world is a bit too static currently. "Can you colorize my
life I'm so sick of black and white?" (Jim Steinman, 1993)

This is an either interesting point of view. It looks like you live in a world
where the real and absolute truth is still existing, neglecting the fact that
so much knowledge has vanished from this planet and has partly been
rediscovered by later generations. It is very easy to understand that all
archives are by definition limited, and therefore the information inside can
only be limited and never _complete_. So if you read some thread in google (or
whereever) it is very likely you do not get the full picture, because some
information (maybe even important) is simply hidden for various reasons. An
answer not found in google does not mean it never existed. You have to keep
that in mind, if you read the corresponding question there.

Well, this cannot be your fault, you are not Jesus. And most likely even he did
not answer every question to full extent, although I tend to think he tried
hard to _listen_ to it.
