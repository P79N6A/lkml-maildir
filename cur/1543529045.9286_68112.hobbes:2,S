If you switch it off, the process knows you've switched it off and
may behave differently.
It's probably possible to lie to the process for gettimeofday and signal
operations though -- have the kernel unmap the page for those processes,
and have a ptrace SEGV handler which provides results as if the page
were still mapped.
