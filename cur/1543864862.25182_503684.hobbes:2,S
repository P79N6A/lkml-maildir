Ric,
Both ATA (ATA8-ACS) and SCSI (SBC-3) have recently added
command support to flag a block as "uncorrectable". There
is no need to send bad "long" data to it and suppress the
disk's automatic re-allocation logic.
In the case of ATA it is the WRITE UNCORRECTABLE command.
In the case of SCSI it is the WR_UNCOR bit in the WRITE
LONG command.
It seems that due to SAT any useful capability in the ATA
command set will soon appear in the corresponding SCSI
command set, if it is not already there.
