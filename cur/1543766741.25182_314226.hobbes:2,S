Indeed. With people running things like cpuspeed daemons to dynamically
scale speed, this is going to be really painful.
Of course, any operation where we have to quiesce DMA is going to mean
we're increasing latency around the scaling operation, but we don't
have to go through all the hoops that are necessary when suspending.
Thankfully some of the more recent implementations of speed/voltage
scaling don't have this requirement.

That would be insane, and make cpufreq totally useless for anyone
running X, so no.   This is one of the reasons the kernel needs to
arbitrate DMA on behalf of X.  It just needs someone to do the work.
