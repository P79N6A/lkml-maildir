This isn't actually a new idea, BTW.  Digital's advfs had storage
pools and the ability to have a single advfs filesystem spam multiple
filesystems, and to have multiple adv filesystems using storage pool,
something like ten years ago.  Something to keep in mind for those
people looking for prior art for any potential Sun patents covering
ZFS.... (not that I am giving legal advice, of course!)
