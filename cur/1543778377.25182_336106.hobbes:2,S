This is the Linux CPU number. ie the namespace where 0
is the boot processor and the others are numbered in
the order that they were started.
> and then call them CPU1 and CPU2 in 
>/proc/acpi/processor?
These are arbitrary device identifiers written
by the BIOS developer and foolishly advertised
to the user by Linux.  The BIOS writer could have
also called them ABC9 and XYZ4 and it would be
equally valid.
We're planning to get rid of all the ACPI stuff
in /proc and move to sysfs.  At that time we'll
use device identifies that are deterministic,
like cpu%d that /sys/devices/system uses today.
cheers,
