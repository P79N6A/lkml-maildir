The main thought is that the driver is broken at the moment, irrespective
of your latest change. Namely:
a) dd a filesystem image (I used 2.88M ext2 LILO floppy but anything
should do) to /dev/rd/0 and mount it.
b) edit some text file on it
c) umount /dev/rd/0
d) dd /dev/rd/0 to a disk file say boot2.img
e) dd /dev/zero to /dev/rd/0
f) dd boot2.img to /dev/rd/0 and mount it. Behold, the text file you
edited is full of zeroes.
The kernel is 2.3.50-SMP + your patch. No rmmod/insmod-ing of rd was done
at any time, i.e. it was only loaded once by:
insmod rd rd_size=2880 rd_blocksize=1024
Please let me know what info you need to assist you with fixing this
problem.
