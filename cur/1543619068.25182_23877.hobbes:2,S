Oh. Cool. I knew I must have been missing some detail.

The "detached mm" approach should be sufficiently parallel to the
read-only page directory entries that the two can use almost the same
framework. The downside is faults on reads in the detached case, but that
shouldn't be significantly worse than the original copy, thanks to the
large fanout.
