All TCP options negociated during session setup are lost. In fact, some
bits (3) are still reserved for the best known value of the MSS, but
that's all. The principle of SYN cookies is that the server does not
create any session upon the SYN, but builds a sequence number constitued
from a hash and the values it absolutely needs to know when the client
validates the session with an ACK.
I've seen some firewalls acting as SYN gateways which send the options
from the server to the client in the first ACK packet from the server.
This is normally not allowed, but it seems to work with some TCP stacks
(at least for the MSS). One solution would be to extend TCP to officially
support this behaviour and to optionally use it along with SYN cookies,
but there will always be old clients not compatible with the extension.
