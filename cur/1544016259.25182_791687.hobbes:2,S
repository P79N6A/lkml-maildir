It has zero downside for *us*.  But it is yet another example of Linux
littering the Unix landscape with unnecessary inconsistencies that
application writers must deal with.  That's a downside for the app
writers.  (But, given how long the existing behavior has been in the
wild, my argument here is somewhat academic...)

Well, POSIX.1-2001 is fairly clear:
      The  application shall ensure that the infop argument points to
      a siginfo_t structure.
(Admittedly, this is a requirement imposed on the application, rather
than the implementation, but the standard goes on to say that the
implemenation shall fill in the structure pointed to by infop.)

Well, that's doable of course.
