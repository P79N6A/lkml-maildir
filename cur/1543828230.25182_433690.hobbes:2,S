It is the 2nd patch 
(PCI-quirk-VIA-IRQ-fixup-should-only-run-for-VIA-southbridges.patch) that is 
causing the sound stuttering/skipping problems for our users with VIA  
chipsets. Backing out the first patch alone did not fix the problem 
(PCI-VIA-quirk-fixup-additional-PCI-IDs.patch) but to back out the 2nd patch, 
you need to have  initially backed out the first patch, due to the way the 
patches apply in series.
Because I was too lazy to make a new patch which backs out only the 2nd patch 
(PCI-quirk-VIA-IRQ-fixup-should-only-run-for-VIA-southbridges.patch) changes, 
I still have not confirmed if its the 2nd patch alone that is causing 
breakage, or if its a combination of both of them.
It took me a long time to track down this problem, as I was spending all my 
time looking at alsa related stuff, but then we finally found that it was 
infact anything above the 2.6.16.17 stable release that was breaking things. 
The obvious first target was to backout the VIA related changes made in the 
2.6.16.17 release and bingo.... my testers with VIA chipsets were happy 
again....
