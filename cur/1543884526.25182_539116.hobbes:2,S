Please inline your patch, rather then attaching them. It makes it very
difficult to discuss when it is attached.

Could you use a better name, like pps_ktimer_test.c, so it is less generic?
Same goes for your kabi.c and sysfs.c files.

This isn't covered by a #ifdef, so is this always safe? Should it be in
a separate patch?
Unfortunately I don't have any hardware to play with this, but I'd
suggest you send this to Andrew Morton for inclusion into his tree for
