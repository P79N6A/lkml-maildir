ah, but it's not the desktop folks who have to be happy but users :-)
Really, if you ask any app designer then obviously 'the more CPU time we
get for sure, the better our app behaves'. So in that sense SCHED_OTHER
is a fair playground: if you behave nicely you'll have higher priority
and shorter latencies.
(there are things like SCHED_ISO but how good of a solution they are is
not yet clear.)

you dont have to - you can drop root after startup.

i'm curious, how does this 'per-app' rlimit thing work? If a user has
jackd installed and runs it from X unprivileged, how does it get the
elevated rlimit? (while the rest of his desktop still runs with a safe
rlimit.) SELinux/RT-LSM could do this, but i'm not sure about how
rlimits give this to you.
