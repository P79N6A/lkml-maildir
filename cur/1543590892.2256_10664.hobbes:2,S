Wasn't there a default? The Indy behind me seems to try to mount
/tftpboot/172.16.18.195, so I put a filesystem there just to make it happy.
It's a 2.4.3 kernel.

Well, if it stops working and stays broken, I suppose I'll just have to 
hack up a built-in command line option. ISTR ARM already has such an option.
I'd rather it didn't break, though.
