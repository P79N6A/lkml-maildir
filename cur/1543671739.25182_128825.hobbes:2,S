It seems cr3 is in the same cache line as esp0 for a 32 byte cache line, 
so it's not that big a deal, but I'd still try to avoid this.

Yes. Consider the following:
	create an LDT entry 
	load the segment to %fs
	clear the LDT entry (or mark it non present), 
		-> %fs is now stale but still marked valid
	...(no task switch)
	Interrupt handled through task gate
		-> stale selector written to TSS
	...(interrupt handler)
	iret-> TS/NP/SF exception when loading segments in the
		new task (I believe it can't be GP)
Of course on an SMP machine with shared LDT, there are even more
ways of triggering segment related exceptions.
Currently %fs and %gs are lazily cleaned up when switching processes
using the standard fixup mechanism, %ds and %es are cleaned up if
necessary when popping them off the stack in the return to user
mode path (the one which ends up in iret). There is no way to recover
from bad user %cs/%ss, the process simply exits in the iret fixup.
But this works only because you can put a specific fixup for each
instruction which loads a given segment register (or two for iret).
In an iret from a task gate, you don't have this fine grained control
(all registers are loaded at once and then checked one by one)
and the return address is unpredictable, so the fixup mechanism is out.
This does not mean that there is no way to safely return from an 
interrupt handled through a task gate, but it's not simple (you 
don't want to change the existing lazy cleanup mechanism which is 
about as simple and low overhead as it gets for the common cases).
