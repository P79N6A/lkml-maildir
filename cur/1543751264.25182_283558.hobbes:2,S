No.  It's platform data.  That means that platforms, (eg, arch/arm/mach-pxa)
are expected to supply it to the SL811 driver.
linux/usb_sl811.h is the correct location for it.  The platforms which
use it are not merged just yet, but the SL811 driver is a recent merge
in preparation of this happening.
