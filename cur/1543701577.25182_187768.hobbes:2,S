It shouldn't be.
Inside the kernel, we should always use the "native" format (ie 64-bit). 
The fact that 64-bit architectures are broken is their bug, and the proper 
way to fix it is to make sure that everything always uses the native 
format.
We should _not_ play games with si_code etc. There is no reason to do so, 
since every entrypointe knows _statically_ whether it is given a 32-bit or 
64-bit version. That's a lot less fragile than depending on a field that 
is filled in by the user.
