Ok, that definitely looks bogus. 
That commit should not matter at _all_, it only changes ppc64 specific 
things. 
If the bug is sometimes hard to trigger, maybe one of the "good" kernels 
wasn't good after all. That would definitely throw a wrench in the 
bisection.
Anyway, with something like this, where there may be false positives 
(false "good" kernels), the only thing you can _really_ trust is a kernel 
that got marked bad, because that one definitely has the problem. So make 
sure that you remember all known-bad kernels.
Btw, we haven't had a lot of testign of the termination condition for "git 
bisect", so it's possible it's off by a commit or two. However, the commit 
you actually ended up on is literally just two commits before 2.6.13-rc5, 
which makes me suspect that it's not the termination condition, as much as 
the fact that it really was an earlier kernel that had the problem, but 
you bisected it as "good" because the problem just didn't trigger quickly 
enough..
