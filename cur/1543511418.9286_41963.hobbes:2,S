Are you sure this isn't the Audio part of the new NeoMagic
MagicMedia256 that is appearing a lot of notebooks? 
That is supported in 2.2.13preX for high X (at least Alan says so, I
used a separate patch from the net).

P.S. I just noticed that there is a skip intro link on that web
page[1] and indeed the 510agp as a Neomagic graphics chipset.
Footnotes: 
[1] Hidden because they the frame they gratuitously popped up coming
from the siemens.de page is too small. They can make very nice PC's
but somebody should tell their web designers they could do with a
cutback on gimmicks.
