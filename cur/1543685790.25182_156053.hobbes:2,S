Eek, let's not go there. Most of the users of get_random_bytes()
depend on it being strong enough for cryptographic purposes. And we've
long guaranteed the existence of a cryptographically strong
/dev/urandom. If userspace could no longer rely on it being there,
people would be forced to go back to poorly reinventing it in
userspace - not good. Having random.c be nonoptional is a good note to
embedded folks that they should think long and hard before ripping it
out.
