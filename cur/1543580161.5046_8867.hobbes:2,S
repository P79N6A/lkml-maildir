Hi,
I have a HP Colorado 4/8GB Travan tape streamer. Under 2.2.18 it works
perfect. But under 2.4.0 it doesn't seem to want to read from the tape
anymore.
When I do a tar tvf /dev/tape, I get an I/O error and in syslog messages
like:
Jan 29 17:10:23 ijsland kernel: ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  8, key =
5, asc = 2c, ascq =  0.
But writing to the tape works fine.
Is this a known problem?
Thanks!
Robert-Jan
