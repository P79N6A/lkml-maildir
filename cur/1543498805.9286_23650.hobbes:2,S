Hi!
 I have tried to compile strace-3.99 and git the follwing compiling
 error:
   gcc -b i586-pc-linux-gnulibc1 -Wall -DHAVE_CONFIG_H   -I. -Ilinux/i386 -I./linux/i386 -Ilinux -I./linux -g -O2 -c ipc.c
In file included from /usr/include/sys/msg.h:7,
                 from ipc.c:38:
/usr/include/linux/msg.h:22: parse error before `wait_queue_head_t'
/usr/include/linux/msg.h:22: warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union
/usr/include/linux/msg.h:23: warning: type defaults to `int' in declaration of `rwait'
/usr/include/linux/msg.h:23: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
/usr/include/linux/msg.h:29: parse error before `}'
make: *** [ipc.o] Error 1
I grep'ed around the include files and found in /usr/include/linux/msg.h
   ...
   struct msqid_ds {
        struct ipc_perm msg_perm;
        struct msg *msg_first;          /* first message on queue */
        struct msg *msg_last;           /* last message in queue */
        __kernel_time_t msg_stime;      /* last msgsnd time */
        __kernel_time_t msg_rtime;      /* last msgrcv time */
        __kernel_time_t msg_ctime;      /* last change time */
 *****  wait_queue_head_t wwait; ******************************
 *****  wait_queue_head_t rwait; ******************************
        unsigned short msg_cbytes;      /* current number of bytes on queue */
        unsigned short msg_qnum;        /* number of messages in queue */
        unsigned short msg_qbytes;      /* max number of bytes on queue */
        __kernel_ipc_pid_t msg_lspid;   /* pid of last msgsnd */
        __kernel_ipc_pid_t msg_lrpid;   /* last receive pid */
};
   ...
where '******' is marking the error point.
Furthermore with more grepping I found in /usr/src/v2.3.6/linux/include/linux
  wait.h:struct __wait_queue_head {
  wait.h:typedef struct __wait_queue_head wait_queue_head_t;
For me it looks like the definition of 'struct msqid_ds' is missing a 'struct'
before wait_queue_head_t ?!
Or is my include file hierachy is strewed up??
Before I blindly patch a very kernel-near file (msg.h) I want to know the
opinion of a more advanced kernel-guru about this. Could one give me a hint?
Thank you very much in advance for any help.
KEEP HACKING!
