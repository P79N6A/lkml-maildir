The fear is that a vendor might not open things because it works
"reasonably enough" (for them as well as the enduser) at "this time".
E.g. I got sis162u.inf for some usb wireless adapter, it works
enough, but of course I am not too happy with the binary blob because
it might have some not-so-"correct" core that could silently oops me
away.
