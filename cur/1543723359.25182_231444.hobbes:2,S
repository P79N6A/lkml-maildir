We should all be working from the upstream kernel.org tree as much as
possible.  In the past we have used ameslab as a repository for the
ppc64 changes that were ready to go but which hadn't got upstream yet.
Now that our patches are going into the upstream BK repository quickly
and reliably there is much less need for ameslab.
If you have something you're working on that isn't ready to go
upstream just yet, post the patch periodically to linuxppc64-dev
and/or linux-kernel.  If other developers want to try your stuff
before it's quite ready they should be applying your patches to their
local trees.
Paul.
