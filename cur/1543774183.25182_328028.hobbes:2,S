Subject: [PATCH] proposed patch for scripts/kconfig/mconf.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I just tried Linux 2.6.12 and I had to change one file in "script"
because my compilation failed on mcconf.c. I tried to contact Arnaldo
Carvalho de Melo about the proposed change because he changed this file
recently adding, among other things, a call to setlocale(). But the
corresponding header file ("locale.h") is not
listed in the files to #include.
This is failing on my cross-compilation environment (From a solaris
system) using gcc-3.4.1 (as the compiler can't find a prototype for the
setlocale() function).
I am not sure who is the "maintainer" of this part of the build system,
so I am now broadcasting it to a larger audience. I hope that's OK.
Sorry if this has already been found/fixed but my "googling" for it
didn't report any hit.
Thanks
JC
=====================================================================
Add <locale.h> in the list of included files to allow the compiler to
find the setlocale() prototype.
