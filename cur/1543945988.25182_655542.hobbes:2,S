I think we agreed, that r-o-bind mounts are more important, so they
should go first.  They have also received more attention.  OTOH there
isn't really any fundamental conflict between the two patchsets, so
going in together (if the ro-bind patches miss 2.6.25) should also be
possible.

So what should I do?
Would Al be wanting to merge this into his VFS tree?  (Can't find it
on git.kernel.org yet, BTW.)  I can set up a git tree for these
patches if that makes things easier.
Or should I just wait and resubmit after every kernel release, hoping
that it becomes _the_ most important thing on Christoph's list ;)
