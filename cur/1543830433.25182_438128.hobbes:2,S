These rules seem to be good. I will try to use the generator
(scripts/kernel-doc) and check the result.
But the bigger problem is that many headers are not documented at all.
And some code is documented but not complying the rules.

Each tarball contains exactly the same as can be browsed online at
kernel-api.org. There is no difference.

Yes, here it is (it's really small and mindless):
--- sed script begin ---
/^\(\s\)*#endif/ {
s/\/\*/\/\//
s/\*\///
}
/^\(\s\)*\/\*.*\*\/\(\s\)*$/ {
s/\/\*/\/\/\//
s/\*\///
}
/^.*\/\*.*\*\/\(\s\)*$/ {
s/\/\*/\/\/\/</
s/\*\///
}
s/^\(\s\)*\/\*/\/\*\*\n/
s/^.*\*\//\n\*\//
--- sed script end ---
