BTW  I get the same messages wether I include fs.h or don't.
But the file exists in the correct location, because if I change location ,
the compiler warns that the file doesn't exists.
It must be that fs.h simply isn't checked by the compiler, could it be a
version issue? But that is only important to Insmod isnt it?

this is normally a sign that you haven't included headers appropriate
to define those structures.
