Danie, you write:

Note that the dir-specific code in ext2_bread() is not readahead, but
rather directory block pre-allocation, which would totally break indexed
directory code (because the empty blocks would not be put into the index
and would remain unreferenced thereafter).
For that matter, I'm not sure whether the dir-prealloc feature even works.
The blocks are created/allocated, but are not initialized with the empty
dirent data (i.e. set rec_len = blocksize), so it would just create a
corrupt directory block.

What do you mean by hanging?  You refer to new (indexed) code or old code?
We definitely cannot repair this damage on-the-fly.  It would be hard/work
to find the next valid dir entry in the block, and that may be a false
positive.  Running e2fsck fixes this by clearing that dirent and setting
the rec_len to the rest of the block (hence deleting all of the remaining
dirents in the block).  The inodes they point to will be put in lost+found,
if that was the only link.
Note that e2fsck also guarantees that a directory start with "." and "..",
so we are pretty safe with the first block-split code.

Yes, I was thinking about both of those as well.  I think the latter would
be easiest, because we only need to keep a single error bit per buffer.
Cheers, Andreas
