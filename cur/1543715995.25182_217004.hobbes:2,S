Speaking of trivia...
Could you please avoid using content-free subjects such as "trivial patch
to dm-io.c"?  We know that it's a patch, and we can see what files it
touches.
Something like "dm-io.c: add static decls, export dm_io_sync_bvec()" would
be a more useful patch description.
It's better than "Updated CPU hotplug patches for IA64 [Patch 3/7]" though.
 Probably a third of the patches I receive have useless summaries and I
have to cook up meaningful ones for them.  Which is not a competely bad
thing but it is, on balance, best that the originator prepare the summary.
Make my life a little easier ;)  Thanks.
