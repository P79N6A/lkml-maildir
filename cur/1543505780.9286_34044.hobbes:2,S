If you run Squid then configure fake_user_agent.
Also worthwhile if you're concerned about privacy is turning on
anonymize_headers or the http_anonymizer feature within Squid (depends on
your version).  pident has an encrypted mode, this is probably moving into
the paranoia zone.  But as they say just because you are doesn't mean they
ain't... ;-)
