Ok, so let's invert the axis on the input device.
I think the raw x value in sysfs behaves the same way as hdaps (because
tools like hdaps-gl don't need any inversion), so I don't invert it.
Anyone with an IBM laptop could confirm this please?
 - x value gets more positive when you lift the right side on the laptop
(= tilted to the left)
 - y value gets more negative when you tilt the laptop backwards
(simply cat /sys/devices/platform/hdaps/position)
Thanks,
Best regards,
Nicolas
Invert x axis on applesmc input device to make it usable as a joystick.
