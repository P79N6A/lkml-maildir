Here's the observed bug that the patch is trying to fix:
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4041
What Marcos posted is a typo-corrected version of Eric Biederman's
patch:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110665542929525&w=2
In Eric's own words, the patch "needs some work before it goes into a
mainline kernel". AFAICT it's more of a proof-of-concept, just to see if
Eric's on the right track...
This is the motivation behind the patch:
