Actually blocking should be ok, as long as the blocking notifier doesn't
unregister
itself. The current next pointer will be always reloaded after the
blocking.
 
Still on preemptive kernels there might be problems, but they could
be likely solved by a few strategic preempt_disables in
notifier_call_chain().
 
Dipankar, what do you think?
