I fixed that up manually, but please be more careful about that next

While I think that the UIP change is correct and a must have, the
locking change is not really useful. read_persistent_clock is called
from exactly three places:
Right after boot, right before suspend and right after resume. None of
those places is a hot path, where we really care about the interrupt
enable/disable. IIRC, this is even called with interrupts disabled
most of the time, so no real gain here.
Another reason not to do the locking change is the paravirt stuff
which is coming for 64bit. I looked into the existing 32bit code and
doing the same lock thing would introduce a real nasty hackery, which
is definitely not worth the trouble.
