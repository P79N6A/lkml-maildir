Oops.  Should have said 'physical' block device.  The kern_mount() function
calls get_unnamed_dev().  I want to modify it so that it also takes an 'char
* dev_name' and does the same thing as the code in do_mount() which picks
which get_sb_???() functions to call.
I'll just make a kern_mount2() until all the other code that calls
kern_mount is changed so that it passes a "none" or something as the second
parameter.
