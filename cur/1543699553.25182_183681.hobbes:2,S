Hi,
is there a way to assign different keyboards to different vcs?
I would like to set up a machine that has 2 keyboards, 2 mice and
2 videocards and run XFree-4.x on both heads. The videocard/monitor and
mouse settings are easy to set up but I cannot find a device setting
for the keyboard in man XF86Config. How can I do it with mainline kernels?
After some googleing I found something called "backstreet ruby"
http://startx.times.lv/eng-faq.html
This gave me this info (howto in a nutshell):
1. Boot with kernel option "dumbcon=N" to activate N dummy console.
2. cat /proc/bus/input/devices gives the input devices, search for keyboard
    entries.
3. To assign a keyboard to a VT, feed the keyboard Phys= entry into
    a VT, e.g. echo "isa0060/serio0/input0" > /proc/bus/console/00/keyboard
4. Start the X server on the proper VT.
The functionality can be found at linuxconsole.sourceforge.net.
Will this be included into mainline near term? Say 2.6.[12]?
The ruby-2.6 is against 2.6.0-test9 so it's almost uptodate.
