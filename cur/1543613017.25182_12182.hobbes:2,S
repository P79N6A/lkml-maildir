And in fact, after furthur playing around with the "fixed" version
(moving shrink_[id]cache_memory to the top of vmscan.c::shrink_caches)
I find that I still will get ENOMEM after updatedb occasionally. Less
often than before, but it still happens.

I just can't understand why the kernel wouldn't tag application memory
as being more important tan buff/cache and free up some of that stuff
when an application calls for it. I mean, it won't even use the gobs of
swap I have. That just seems to be a plain ol' bug to me.
