yes, i made it totally configurable in 2.4 days: 1:3, 2/2 and 3:1 splits 
were possible. It was a larger patch to enable all this across x86, but 
the Kconfig portion was removed a bit later because people _frequently_ 
misconfigured their kernels and then complained about the results.
so for now the trivial solution is to change the "C" to "8" in the 
following line in include/asm-i386/page.h:
>  #define __PAGE_OFFSET		(0xC0000000)
instead of editing your .config :-)
Maybe we could try the Kconfig solution again, but it'll need alot 
better documentation, dependency on KERNEL_DEBUG and some heavy warnings 
all around.
