Not quite.  sparc64 is the only user which makes any use of the
addresses passed to it, but frv does a little assembler with it,
and arm26 does a printk - eh? I'd take that to mean that it never
gets called there, but I don't see what prevents it, before or now.

Depends really on what DavidH wants there, not clear to me.
I suspect Ian can live without his printk!
