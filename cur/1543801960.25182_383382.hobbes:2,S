Check whether nl_sk equals NULL.
I don't know whether there's an assert() macro available for you, so try this:
/* [...] */
    if (nl_sk == NULL)
    {
        printk(KERN_ALERT "nltest: nl_sk is NULL!");
        goto return_free;
    }
    netlink_unicast(nl_sk, nl_skb, pid, 0);
return_free:
    kfree_skb(nl_skb);
}
A gdb backtrace of the user space part won't give you much, since you
found out the problem lies in kernel space.
What does netlink_unicast() do?
Leslie
