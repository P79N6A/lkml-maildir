I don't want to play devil's advocate, but there is clearly *more* bloat
in adding a "chroot" executable in a directory than having a syscall and
boot option in the kernel. Not to mention that the chroot binary must be
replicated into all the available chroots (ok sometimes maybe it can be
achieved using hardlinks).
While I think that the feature does not bring much for mainline distros,
it makes more sense for embedded or rescue systems where init is responsible
for setting the system up, including extraction of libs and binaries (eg:
run busybox --install) or mounting of other filesystems.
