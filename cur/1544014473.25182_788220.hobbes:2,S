The patch is not only about __crc_* - for vmlinux, this part really doesn't
matter, but there's a significant amount of other symbols that get stripped
from vmlinux with the second patch.

Would certainly be doable, but would seem reasonable only if it's a small
set of easily recognizable symbols. If you look at scripts/strip-symbols,
you may agree that it's better to do this at build time...
