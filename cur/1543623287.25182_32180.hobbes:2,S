Even if WCE is enabled in the caching mode page, we can still set FUA
(Force Unit Access) in individual write commands to force platter
completion before commands complete.
Of course, it's a good question whether this is honoured properly on
all drives.
FUA is not available on WRITE6, only WRITE10 or WRITE12 commands.
