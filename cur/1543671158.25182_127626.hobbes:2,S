I'm using Red Hat kernel 2.4.18-26.7.x.
I ran a program which is trying to suck up all of memory.  I would like 
to kill the process, but "top", "vmstat", and "ps" all hang when I try 
to use them.  Also, pressing ctrl-c in the terminal where I can the 
program won't kill it.
To an extent, however, the system was still usable, albeit EXTREMELY 
unresponsive.  Eventually, the program dumped core, and everything 
returned to norma.
Is this a known problem?
