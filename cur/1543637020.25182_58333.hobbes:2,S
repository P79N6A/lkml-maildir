Yes --- I've been holding back on the changes in the ext3 CVS because
of one nagging bug which I've been hunting for, and which I think I
just found two weeks ago, the day before I left for a holiday.  (It's
another possible cause for a "buffer_jdirty()" assert failure in
commit.c on SMP machines.)
I'll get that checked in shortly.

I'm just back from holiday so I haven't been able to do much on this
recently, but I've got a fix mostly coded --- it just doesn't
actually work particularly well, yet.  :-)
Cheers,
