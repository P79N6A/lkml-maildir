IANIngo, but the warning is already there:
* Proprietary module user probably already knows that major deviations from .config
  and kernel its module is released is no-no.
* Unknown symbol name contains "lockdep" which attentive proprietary
  module user will notice and correlate with enabling lockdep 5 minutes ago.
* Tomorrow Ingo will change it's name, add a couple of new lockdep only
  exports so should he update help text every time _he_ changes _his_
  code?
* Would you add similar notice to inotify help text? It also exports
  GPL-only symbols doncha know. Would you add such notices to everything
  exporting GPL-only symbols?
