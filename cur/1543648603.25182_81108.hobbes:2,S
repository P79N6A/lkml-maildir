   the photographer would like it if the mp3 player can't remove files
   in ~/photos/ when it plays a malicious .mp3 file.
LSM doesn't provide anything in this area which can't be done
today.  You can protect that directory from malicious programs
today with file/dir protections and running programs with a different
capability set or even with a different euid/egid for file accesses.
