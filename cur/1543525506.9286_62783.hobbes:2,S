Well, I don't know the actual incantation, but you shouldn't scan for
setuid programs on a capability based system.
By the way, any almost any capability on a capability based system can
be leveraged to "root" (whatever that gives you). 
For compatiblity reasons, it may prove a good idea to pretend that the
setuid bit is set if ANY of the forced bits is set.
