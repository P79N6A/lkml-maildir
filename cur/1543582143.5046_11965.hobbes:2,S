This is not enough. 
If another CPU has started write-out of one of the dirty pages (which, as
far as I can tell, is certainly unlikely but not impossible) while we were
still handling other dirty pages, that other CPU might clear the physical
dirty bit of that page while a third CPU (or the same writer, but that
makes the timing even _more_ unlikely) is still using a stale "dirty" TLB
entry and writing to the page (and not updating the virtual dirty bit
because it doesn't know that it has already been cleared).
So you have to somehow guarantee that you invalidate the TLB's before the
dirty bit from the "struct page" can be cleared (which in turn has to
happen before the writeout). That can obviously be done with the tlb range
flushing, but it needs more locking.
This is, actually, a problem that I suspect ends up being _very_ similar
to the zap_page_range() case. zap_page_range() needs to make sure that
everything has been updated by the time the page is actually free'd. While
filemap_sync() needs to make sure that everything has been updated before
the page is written out (or marked dirty - which obviously also guarantees
the ordering, and makes the problems look even more similar).
