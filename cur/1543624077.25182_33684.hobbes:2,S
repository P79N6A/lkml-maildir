From my point of view, there is no 'perfect' choice.
You can buy bcm57xx based boards, where the chipset is nice but the driver
not really nice yet.
You can buy syskonnect sk98 boards, which definitely have a good chipset - 
but the driver doesn't support the tcp transmit zerocopy path yet.  I've
tried to put some pressure on SysKonnect about this - but they seem a bit
'slow'.
You can buy natsemi boards, which is a more-or-less crappy chipset, but 
there is a nice linux driver.
Summary:
Old acenic boards are still the best solution - but there are no longer
available for quite some time :(
