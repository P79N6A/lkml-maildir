Excuse me? The year 2000 is most certainly a leap year. Grab out a
calendar.... in case you're forgetting the rules are
if ( (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0 )
  leap_year = true;
And as for the a February 30th I read once that somehow Sweden once lost
sync by a day with the rest of the world and required a february 30th to
catch up. Don't put much stock in it, but in any case there definitely IS
a 29th this year and NO 30th.
I am getting a little tired of this thread and while I am not a kernel
hacker by any stretch of the imagination, this thread really does not
belong anymore
