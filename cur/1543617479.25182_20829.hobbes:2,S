Melvin is a html-only geek, but not stupid. He knows where he can get the
sources for the distribution's kernel, and he knows very well that it is
advisable to stick to the distribution's software. He understands enough of
the process so he can tailor a kernel for _webserving_, not optimal use of
all hardware on Ye Olde Coffepot. He leaves out sound, serial support, and
acceleration support for the video card (What for in a webserver?),
configures floppy and CD as modules (to save the odd byte), just ext3 as
builtin filesystem (no need for all the others, iso9660 is module for some
savings). He includes iptables support, but no connection tracking or NAT
modules. All things an autoconfigurator wouldn't dream of doing on its own.
[Again, building a tailored kernel for a specific application on a crappy
 machine is no place for automatism; for everything else an Aunt Tillie
 might need a "get nearest size" is enough]

If Melvin did compile the kernel in the first place, he is smart enough to
keep .configure around. If not, he doesn't deserve getting laid.
For terminally stupid Melvins, keep .configure around somewhere.
