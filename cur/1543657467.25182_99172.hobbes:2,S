The good news is that it worked for me. Not only that, I have just 
managed to get lkcd to save a dump in memory and then write it out 
to disk after a kexec soft boot ! I haven't tried real panic cases yet 
(which probably won't work rightaway :) ) and have testing and 
tuning to do. But kexec seems to be looking good.
Have a wonderful new year.
