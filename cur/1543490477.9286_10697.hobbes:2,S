Suppose someone writes a tool that measures seek-times of a specific disk
in detail, wouldn't that program be able to discover the physical layout?
And then, wouldn't there be the possibility to feed that information to
the kernel? Even if the benchmark takes long, it only has to be run once
on each disk.
