i'm not sure i follow.  the reported problem is that file locking does
not work on tmpfs/ramfs storage.  a not terribly uncommon scenario is
to use tmpfs on /tmp (or similar location) and have file locking not
work at all.  so programs that use file locking or scripts that
leverage the flock utility from the util-linux package break.
