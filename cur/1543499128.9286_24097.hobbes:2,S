Great. Doing it in race-free way is your job, then. Deal? Locking issues
in your scheme will be terrible, but if you want to do it - go ahead.
BTW, what for? Almost all filesystems can deal with the standard scheme in
clean way. On the VFS level it *does* involve 3 filesystems, but providing
any sort of persistence via separate *on-disk* filesystem or, worse yet,
file will give you the shitload of races and/or deadlocks. Good luck
fighting with them...
After all, you do not consider ->notify_change() intrusive, right? We
could keep a separate on-disk fs containing permissions and ownership
information, sure. Just look at UMSDOS and you'll see how much PITA it
gives.
