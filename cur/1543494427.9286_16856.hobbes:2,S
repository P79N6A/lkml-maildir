I'm running 2.2.7, but this has been there for few older versions also.
I can't write partition table to disk.
when I try to remove partition /dev/hda12 (which is not mounted or used in
any way) (like, 'd', '12', 'w') I get next message:
Command (m for help): w
The partition table has been altered!
Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.
Re-read table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy.
Reboot your system to ensure the partition table is updated.
strace reveals:
sync()                                  = 0
nanosleep(0xbffff618, 0xbffff618, 0x400a86cc, 0, 0x8048d50) = 0
ioctl(3, BLKRRPART, 0x2)                = -1 EBUSY (Device or resource busy)
close(3)                                = 0
It's standard new IDE HDD driver... Looking into source (if I got correct
one), it says:
        if (drive->busy || (drive->usage > 1)) {
                spin_unlock_irqrestore(&hwgroup->spinlock, flags);
                return -EBUSY;
        };
but there I stopped. I have no expirience with ide_drive_t structure, but it
says that busy is 'currently doing revalidate_disk' and that usage is
'current "open()" count for drive'. Well, I can easily see how open() count
for drive could be much bigger than '1', if we are talking about whole
/dev/hda, and not /dev/hda12.
But I distinctly remember that I was able to change partition table of drive
which has few mounted filesystems (at least add new partitions). Or have I
totally gone mad ?
/proc/mounts says:
