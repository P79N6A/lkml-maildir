Subject: time_t size: The year 2038 bug Summary:
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In summary of the emails, some of which were kinda like 
referencing an uninitialized pointer was that if today were in the 
year 2038 we will have problems.  
Assuming that none of us are really true prophets, capable of 
foretelling the future, then the SAFE assumption is that if nothing is 
done, then in 2038 we will have machines accessing time_t 
variables as though they were 32 bit, hence Linux will have the 
2038 bug.
That said, how do we fix it?  Or is it something we just believe will 
fix itself?  It sounds like it is both a kernel and a libc issue.  It also 
seems to me that the easiest thing is to go to 64 bits.
I am not doing libc or kernel development, so I don't believe I can 
own this one, though I am open to suggestions-any takers?
