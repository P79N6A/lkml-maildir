That sounds like a nice MythTV box to me :)

Unless Windows XP IO APIC mode contains a soldering iron and rework
wire to physically change the way the hardware IRQ lines are connected,
this is nonsense.
Or the engineer means that in legacy PIC mode the IRQs are shared, but
in APIC mode they can be separated. That is a different thing, cause in
that case the IRQ lines are not physically connected, but put together
in PIC mode and can again be separated by using APIC mode.

Depends on the hardware, but Linux does indeed support IO APIC.
