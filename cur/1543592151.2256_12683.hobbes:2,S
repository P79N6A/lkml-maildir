 Hi all,
     I am using Red Hat 6.2. I am getting a lot of errors when i use 
make command. Is it becoz of some improper environmental variable
settings?? What should they be set to??? 
  I tried this on various make files under the filesystem (fs)
subdirectory of the source code. 
  Are there any settings to be done before running this command??
    Kindly send me a CC of ur replies. 
  Thanks in advance,
 srikanth
