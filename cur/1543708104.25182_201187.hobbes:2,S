It doesn't update arch/mips/kernel/scall64-64.S and
arch/mips/kernel/scall64-n32.S?
I'd be inclined to leave it as sys_shmat().  It is logically a syscall, and
the fact that everyone except mips (and ia64) sticks a multiplexer in front
of it is a sad historical note.
It's simply a matter of getting the appropriate prototype in scope for all
the C callers.  For now, I'd be inclined to bung the prototype in kernel.h,
because Randy's syscalls.h patches will fix all this for real in a week or
two.
