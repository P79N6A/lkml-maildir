Wrong.  The BLK is dropped in sock_ioctl, but struct netdevice::do_ioctl
is called with rtnl_lock held:
	net/core/dev.c:
		rtnl_lock();
		ret = dev_ifsioc(&ifr, cmd);
		rtnl_unlock();
Therefore for 2.4.x, our concern is whether a particular net driver
needs further SMP protection internally, or if rtnl_lock (a semaphore,
not a spinlock) is sufficient.
