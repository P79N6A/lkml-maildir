First, "uninitialised variables" is a misdescription here.  Variables
declared outside the scope of functions are _always_ initialised even
though there is no apparant assignment.
They're placed in the BSS, or "zero initialised" section.  They have
a well defined value.  Zero.
Registering with the block layer with a major number of zero means
"find me a free major number and assign that to me."  This is nothing
new.  If devfs can't cope with that, devfs is buggy.  Use udev instead.
