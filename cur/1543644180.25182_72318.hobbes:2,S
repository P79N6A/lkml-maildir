Thanks for the vote of confidence :)
Now for some results (out of date, but also has results with backported code 
from 2.5) see 
http://lse.sf.net/locking/dcache/dcache.html.
Preliminary profiling of webserver benchmarks in 2.5.3X show similar potential
for dcache_rcu. I will have actual results published when we can
get formal runs done.
Thanks
