It should be possible to do, though. There's nothing really different in 
making the "default" (unnamed) fork be a special device or a fifo.
And it would be perfectly ok for O_DIRECTORY to open such a file, as long
as it opens the directory branch, not the special device.
I advocated (long ago) something like this for /dev handling, just because
I think it would make sense to have
	/dev/hda	<- special file
	/dev/hda/part1	<- partition 1 (aka /dev/hda1)
which just seems like a very obvious and intuitive interface to me. Of 
course, we have so much legacy in /dev that there's no real point to doing 
this, but it's still an appealing approach, I think.
But I do take Al's concerns seriously. I like the notion of supporting
"containers", but there are undoubtedly serious issues in the notion. I
don't strictly know exactly _how_ to implement it sanely (I can talk about
using the vfsmnt structure all I like, but the fact is, it's a different
thing from a normal mount, and there may be serious problems indeed
there).
Still, I really do like the idea of merging the notion of file and
directory into one notion of "container". I absolutely _detest_ files with
internal structure that tools have to know about (ie I hate seeing all
those embedded formats that I can't use "grep" on - MIME being one case).
I'd much rather see a "group of files"  and a "file with a grouping of
information".
(Now, flattening that "group of files" is obviously needed for serial 
protocols, so I think MIME/tar/xxxx are fine for _transporting_ data, but 
I'm saying that outside of transport I really prefer a "collection of 
files" approach).
