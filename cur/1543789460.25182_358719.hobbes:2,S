They are required fields for the POSIX timer.  I think you are saying that they should be there and 
not in the ktime struct, which is part of the POSIX timer struct.  Is that right?
Along this line, I have a bit of a problem with the ktimer code doing the timer repeat stuff.  This 
is NOT used by POSIX timers because we want to wait for the user to pick up the signal before 
starting the next interval.  This is key to avoiding timer storms and I would think that puting the 
repeat stuff in ktimer code opens it to the possibility of other users starting a timer storm via 
this.  I think the itimer code should also use the signal call back to start the next interval, and 
for the same reason.

Eh?  Granted we don't truncate the time on settime, but how else is it ignored?

In the timer_settime() call there is only one possible resolution refered to, that of the specified 
clock.  The standard says(
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/timer_settime.html
):
Time values that are between two consecutive non-negative integer multiples of the resolution of the 
specified timer shall be rounded up to the larger multiple of the resolution. Quantization error 
shall not cause the timer to expire earlier than the rounded time value.
This says a) round to the next resolution, and b) don't allow the resulting timer to expire early. 
The implication is that timers are to expire on resolution boundries so we need to round such that 
the expire happens _after_ the rounded time.
Am I missing something here?
The assumption, that I think you made, that we can let the hardware do the rounding runs contrary to 
one of the main reasons for resolution, i.e. to group timers so that we can reduce the system 
overhead.  Just because we have timer hardware with microsecond resolution is not reason enough to 
offer it to the user as handling an interrupt every micro second is way too much overhead, and, in 
most cases, the user doesn't even want to such a fine resolution.

POSIX clocks and timers are part of the REAL TIME POSIX extension.  Arguing that real time apps need 
to be portable is, I think, rather beside the point.  At the same time, if rounding follows the 
rules, one can set up a timer_settime() timer_gettime() sequence to get the resolution, even with 
the itimer one can do this.  So resolution is available to the user in one way or another.  What he 
does with it is up to him, but at least some RT apps. set up timer to expire early and after expiry, 
busy wait until the "appointed" time.  Knowing the resolution helps to know how to set this up...
