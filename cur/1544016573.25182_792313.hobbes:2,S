Subject: [PATCH 1/4] trace: print ftrace_dump at KERN_EMERG log level
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Impact: fix to print out ftrace_dump when expected
I was debugging a hard race condition to only find out that
after I hit the race, my log level was not at level to show
KERN_INFO. The time it took to trigger the race was wasted because
I did not capture the trace.
Since ftrace_dump is only called from kernel oops (and only when
it is set in the kernel command line to do so), or when a
developer adds it to their own local tree, the log level of
the print should be at KERN_EMERG to make sure the print appears.
ftrace_dump is not called by a normal user setup, and will not
add extra unwanted print out to the console. There is no reason
it should be at KERN_INFO.
