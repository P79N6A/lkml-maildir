This has very different semantics. Consider lseek().

I don't see a bug. I see differing behaviour between Linux and BSD on a
completely non standards defined item. Also btw nobody ever really wrote
a /dev/fd/ for Linux - it was just a byproduct of the proc stuff someone
noticed. I guess someone could write a Plan-9 style dev/fd or devfdfs
for Linux if they wanted.
