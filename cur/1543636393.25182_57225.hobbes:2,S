Well, I also like the non C99 variant that is in gcc as well, but if gcc is
going to drop that in the future in favour of the C99 standard... But yes,
not having the spacing is _ugly_, what I'm doing is:
static struct proto_ops SOCKOPS_WRAPPED(atalk_dgram_ops) = {
        .family         = PF_APPLETALK,
        .release        = atalk_release,
        .bind           = atalk_bind,
        .connect        = atalk_connect,
        .socketpair     = sock_no_socketpair,
        .accept         = sock_no_accept,
.
.
.
