Hello, I saw that there was something changed on how fork() works, and
wonder if this could be the cause my problem.
When i do a "su - <user>" it just hangs.
When i run strace on it i see that it forks and wait()s on the child.
Sometimes when i strace the su command it succeeds to give me a shell,
sometimes not.
But it allways fails when i don't strace it.
