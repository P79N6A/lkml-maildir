A prefix which describes the function of a driver is of course only
useful if it /correctly/ describes it.  What would be /correct/?  If a
driver for a audio + video capable camera supports either both audio and
video capture or only video capture, I don't see anything wrong with a
prefix like "camera".
That said, we have "modinfo" at our disposal if we spot something
nondescript in lsmod's listing.
