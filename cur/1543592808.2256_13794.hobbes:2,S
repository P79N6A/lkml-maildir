I'm terribly sorry for my unprecise description.
By "sudden shutdown" I meant that the machine freezes hard and when running X
using the Magic SysRq key combinations don't seem to work so power cycling was
the only option. It seems that it wasn't just the keyboard that had frozen
because a webserver I'm running on the machine also stopped serving pages.
Thanks,
Peter
