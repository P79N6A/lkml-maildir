It still deadlocks:
CPU 0                           CPU 1
write_lock(&tasklist_lock);     
__exit_signal()
                                timer expires
                                base->running_timer = timer
                                  send_group_sigqueue()
                                   read_lock(&tasklist_lock();
exit_itimers()
  del_timer_sync(timer)
     waits for ever because           waits for ever on tasklist_lock
     base->running_timer == timer
I still think the last patch I sent is still necessary.

Not much. I look into this
