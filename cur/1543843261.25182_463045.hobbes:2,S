I don't think so.  32-bit code running on x86-64 has different TLS 
selectors, and everything seems to work there...

My goal would be to do a minimal change which packs all the useful stuff 
together in a 64-byte line.  Ideally it would just use two 32-byte 
lines, but I don't think that's as important.
Caching effects are pretty hard to measure anyway, and with something as 
deeply x86-microarchitectural as this, I could imagine lots of other CPU 
cleverness which could obscure any simple measurement.  But packing 
things into a line certainly can't hurt.
I'll put something together, and see how it goes...
