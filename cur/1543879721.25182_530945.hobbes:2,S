instance could be NULL if cxacru_sysfs_show_adsl_state is called after
the device has been unbound.  What prevents this?

This is not serialized by a lock, so if two or more processes call it
simultaneously then the commands to the modem can be interleaved, which
could (a) leave it in a funky state, and (b) means that the value of poll
could be wrong when you write it to instance->poll_state, eg because the
processes could reach the poll_state writing step in reverse order to the
order in which they reached the sending-commands-to-the-modem step.

Can poll_state really have anything else than its initial
value here?

Between releasing the lock and calling cxacru_poll_status, another
process could have called cxacru_sysfs_store_adsl_state and changed
whether you want to poll or not.  I don't know if it matters.

Likewise.

Your device has been removed.  Why would you want to go on
polling?  Especially as your device structures are about to
be freed...  By the way, where do you remove the sysfs files?

This looks unreliable, again due to race conditions.  Better to always
shoot it down.
Ciao,
