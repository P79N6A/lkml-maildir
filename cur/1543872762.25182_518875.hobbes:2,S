Ok, so that's just a message irritation, not actually bothersome 
otherwise?

.. and this one has never worked without irqpoll?

So it's the irq16 one that is the Jmicron controller and just isn't 
getting any interrupts?
Since all the other interrupts work (and MSI worked for other 
controllers), I don't think it's interrupt-routing related. Especially as 
MSI shouldn't even care about things like that.
And since it all works when "irqpoll" is used, that implies that the 
*only* thing that is broken is literally irq delivery.
Is there possibly some jmicron-specific "enable interrupts" bit?

Gaah. Can you get a log through serial console or netconsole to see what 
changed?
