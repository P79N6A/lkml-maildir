Since there are no users except your module, you do have exclusive
access already, i.e. you can stop key reloading and get your gain, but
there is no possibility for crypto module to know that in advance
(without hack like checking reference counter or storing private context
pointer in some internals and check it for each new call for
encrypt/decrypt).

Yes, admin is a god. I would even say the god.
So it can (if she/he wants to) setup any module with any name so that
other users would never know it.
