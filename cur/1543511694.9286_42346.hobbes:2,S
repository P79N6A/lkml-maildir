I was advocating devfs because it's there. My understanding about devfs
now is that's mostly userspace. The only thing kernel space is a /proc
like dynamic fs interface for devfs. All of the policy is in userspace.
It makes very little difference to me if it's kernel or userspace
oriented. However, what I've read from all of the people that matter,
userspace is it and that's what it looks like it's going to be.
What needs to happen is some sort of acceptance behind devfs or
something else which is dynamic.
All I've seen about devfs and heard about it is, "Well, it's good, but I
don't know". This is probably one of the worst things that can be said
since it instills confusion over the future path of what's going to
happen.
Peter Anvin seems to be advocating some sort of completely userspace
daemon which uses a pipe or fifo (or something similar) to communicate
with the kernel when additions or deletions occur. The userspace daemon
then makes all of the appropriate standard system calls (mkdir, mknod,
etc) to create a somewhat traditional style /dev based on a users
policy. This seems like a good idea to me, but, I don't make these
decisions.
I think everyone has agreed that a daemon needs to exist, which is
userspace, has some sort of interface to the kernel to be notified about
additions and deletions and creates a /dev based on user policy. Do you
agree with this? Does anyone disagree with this?
Are the majority of people's problems with devfs based on the fact that
it has too much kernel code?
I don't want anyone to be offended with another email on this topic, but
there's a bunch of confusion over this (I'm probably the most confused)
and there has been no consensus on what to do.
