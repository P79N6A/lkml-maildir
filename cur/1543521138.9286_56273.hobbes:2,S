Hi,
I got an oops in 2.2.14 running under (probably, I wasn't watching it) heavy
load.
I had to write the oops output down by hand as the machine had locked solid, hopefully 
I didn't make any mistakes....
I probably should also say that this is stock 2.2.14 but with a modified driver the SMC 
network card that attempts to work around some problems with the driver [do ANY network
card/driver combinations work RELIABLY under sustained heavy traffic? -  I've yet to find
one]
Here is the output from ksymoops:
ksymoops 0.7c on i686 2.2.14-TES1.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.2.14-TES1/ (default)
     -m /System.map (specified)
No modules in ksyms, skipping objects
Warning (read_lsmod): no symbols in lsmod, is /proc/modules a valid lsmod file?
