Alan, although I didn't completely get what patch Ivan refered, 2.4.8
seems to be the far most instable when OOM happens (it just never
survived the 2nd wave of memory stressing for me).

Sure, every experienced user knows that but many people are lazy, busy,
etc to do it properly and most newcomers, desktop users basically don't
want to know about it. Forget distributors setting unreasonable limits
for them, kernel just shouldn't crash in OOM - it could handle it in the
past. This OOM issue wasn't such big problem in the past but recently
it's really getting scary. I've ported the OOM killer to 2.2 and added
reserved root VM support and AFAIR I mentioned only once here, google
indexed the page and people hits it increasingly -- about 10-20 times
more often then OOM problems pop up here. Most of them USER_AGENT
contains the Windows word - and yes, they are explicitely looking for
solution for Linux related OOM problems.

BTW, 2.4 has another feature. vm_enough_memory() in 2.2 underestimated
the available free memory (memory is overcommited anyway) and apps got
more frequently ENOMEM. 2.4 overestimates free memory (because
e.g. nobody knows how much cache could be freed) so apps get killed
mostly by OOM killer.

In most cases I would definitely agree with this argument but I think in
this case people who have this problem either can't code it themself or
"can't" pay for it - they just expect (unconsciously) Linux can handle
OOM just as good as others or even better.
