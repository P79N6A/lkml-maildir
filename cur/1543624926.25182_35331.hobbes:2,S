One variant of this would be to automatically use the remote file as
long as the file contents are the same.  That way, if I apply a patch
locally and Marcello/Linus later apply the same patch and put it into
the official tree, I can use the official version.  This would
probably handle most of the conflicts I have seen so far.  If there
are any "real" conflicts, I can handle them manually.
