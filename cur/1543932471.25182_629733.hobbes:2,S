00:0b must be a "motherboard" device, probably PNP0C01 or PNP0C02.
Those are catch-all devices with no real programming model associated
with them; they only describe resource usage.  AFAICT, they're mostly
used to describe legacy stuff like interrupt controllers, timers, etc.
My laptop has the same range for one of its PNP0C02 devices.  I'll
try to dig up a chipset spec and see what might look like that range.
We used to ignore anything past the first 8 I/O port regions and 4
memory regions (PNP_MAX_PORT and PNP_MAX_MEM), but those limits have
been recently bumped a bit [1].  That will cause additional reservations
that may explain some of the issues we're seeing.
