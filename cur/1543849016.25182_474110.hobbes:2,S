Subject: [PATCH](acpi:memory hotplug) Change log level of a message of acpi_memhotplug to KERN_DEBUG
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/18/146

This patch may be a bit trivial. But, I suppose this message seems
quite useless except debugging. It just shows "Hotplug Mem Device".
System admin can't know anything by this message.
So, I would like to change it to KERN_DEBUG.
This patch is for 2.6.19-rc2.
Please apply.
