The rules are a bit more complex than that -- write are weakly ordered, 
but still ordered.  They maybe be delayed with respect to other stores, 
but will never occur before other stores are visible to the cache 
heirarchy.  In terms of how writes to the write combining region are 
delayed, you'll have to look at the addresses of the registers you are 
writing to.  If they map to the same write combining buffer (that is each 
one can combine with the previous write) and are increasing in address, 
then you don't need the explicite barrier.  Most hardware is laid out so 
that this is possible.
The case the write combining buffers affect memory ordering in an 'unexpected' 
way is if your writes combine and you write to registers in an order that 
is opposite from that in which they combine.  Ie, a write to address 8 
followed by a write to address 0 that combines will show up on the bus 
as 0, 8 (assuming an 8 byte writes at 0).  Besides that, the write combining 
buffers can introduce a delay of a few clocks while the cpu defers the write 
in the hope that it will combine with another write, but that delay applies 
to all writes that go through the write combining buffers and thus do not 
change the memory ordering (except as previously noted).
Memory barriers are not cheap.  At least for the example you provided, 
it looks like things are overdone and performance is going to suck, so 
it needs to be avoided if at all possible.  I really think that you 
should be using wmb().
