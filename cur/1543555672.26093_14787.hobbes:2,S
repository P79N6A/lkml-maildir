Yes and yes. However, you still would need the controller specific code
built-in.
The USB floppy situation is uglier still. When I tried to put Debian on my
VAIO from floppy, I discovered that even with a USB-enabled kernel, the
floppy wasn't available in time to mount /. 
Approaches that did work, in case anyone is curious, were using loadlin
with FreeDOS (incredibly slow) to preload the second floppy via BIOS, or
using syslinux and a custom mini-kernel and initrd image crammed onto a
single floppy.
