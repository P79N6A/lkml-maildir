This patch series adds support for the touchscreen controllers provided
by Wolfson Microelectronics WM97xx series chips in both polled and
streaming modes.  The series can also be pulled via git from:
	git://opensource.wolfsonmicro.com/linux-2.6-touch upstream
This version:
 - Has been rebased against v2.6.25-rc1
 - Fixes usage of the platform API to avoid double registration of the
   battery and touch devices.
 - Removes the use of the obsolete sound/driver.h.
