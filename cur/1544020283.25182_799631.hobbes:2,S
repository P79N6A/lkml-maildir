I have tried the updates and it fixes all the problems I found initially.
I tried it on a larger volume as well with files >4GB ('messed up' by copying
many large files to it on XP at the same time) and it works well. (File
integrity checked using md5sum).
I would like to see this exfat read-only driver included in a future linux kernel.
Thanks again for the replies and the prompt fixes!
Cheers,
Max
