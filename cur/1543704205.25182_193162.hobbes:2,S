No.  We have no fscking idea what device it is.  All we know is a device
number.  No driver-related activity (including insmod, etc.) happens
until open().
Among other things, RAW_SETBIND on inexistent device is a legitimate use.
Which kills your "create a symlink at RAW_SETBIND" immediately - there
might very well be nothing for it to point to.
You can bind /dev/raw0 to 8:0, then attach USB disk and then open
/dev/raw0.  That ends up with /dev/raw0 becoming a raw alias for
that disk.
