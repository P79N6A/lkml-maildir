Hello,
I have an Alpha on which 2.2.11 boots but 2.3.17 does not.  This is
the first 2.3.x kernel that has compiled for me on Alpha.  Here is all
the information I have; I can produce as much as you'd like provided
instructions.
2.2.11# dmesg | grep qlogic
qlogicisp : new isp1020 revision ID (5)
2.2.11# cat /proc/scsi/isp1020/0
Qlogic ISP1020 SCSI on PCI bus 01 device 48 irq 40 base 0x9000
2.3.17 fails on boot when trying to mount the root fs.  I think the
relevant messages would be
qlogicisp: new isp1020 revision ID (5)
qlogicisp: can't decode address space 0x8100
It occurs to me that this might be a problem related to the new PCI
allocation scheme, but that's just speculation.  Could somebody point
me in the right direction?
Thanks,
Aron Griffis
