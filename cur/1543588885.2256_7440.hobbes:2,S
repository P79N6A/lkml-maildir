Well, I know a little bit about procfs because I'm currently
documenting it, so that's why I picked it first. After I got the idea,
isofs was quite easy.
In retrospect it would have been more effective to pick a filesystem
with a larger *_inode_info field, but then again: Al is right. Struct
inode is cluttered with *_inode_info fields, while we use anonymous
data entries in other parts of the kernel (like the data pointer in
struct proc_dir_entry, or the priv pointer in struct net_device).
There is another advantage: suppose you're hacking on a filesystem and
change it's *_fs_i.h header. With Al's proposal you only have to
recompile the filesystem you're hacking on, while you have to recompile
the complete kernel in the current situation.
