And how many users and how many kernel hackers are able to decode
morse on the fly? Are you going to explain to users
"to debug this you'll need to learn morse" ?
If you want to make debugging easy for laptops write a USB or firewire
console. Firewire is actually quite interesting because it can even
do DMA, so you could peek into the memory.
Morse is not helpful.
I admit I was the on who got this ball running by suggesting it "as an 
exercise for the reader" in the original panic blink code, but
guys this was intended as a JOKE, not serious. Please get over it
and don't merge that silly code.
Thanks,
