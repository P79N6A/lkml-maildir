This discussion has now returned to earth. But the problem is for that price
you can get a general purpose pc or even a low end server that can do so much
more.[1] This almost assuredly means this is a low volume product. Then add in
the significant product support that is going to be required if the general
public uses it, (as someone else has pointed out.) and you have some huge
negatives on the other side of the equation...

[1]I know of a group in San Jose who are fooling around with 1U servers that have
3 or 4 network connections that they want to sell for considerably less than
$1000. They actually have prototypes and will be demonstrating them at the next
svlug installfest. (I think) Check out
