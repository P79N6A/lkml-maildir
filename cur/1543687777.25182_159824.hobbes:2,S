I thought about this very deeply last night and this morning.
And what you're trying to optimize won't work.  Here is why.
If the first access to a MAP_PRIVATE mapping of a page is a read,
we'll use the page-cache page.  This means that, with your
optimization, during this time if another cpu write()`s into the
page we'll lose the data update.
Sorry :(
