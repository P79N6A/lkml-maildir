Hmm, not sure we want to do it this way. Especially since you
got unsolved races. But patch review ignoring the 10k foot picture again.

Can't this starve? If a process is unlucky enough (e.g. from 
lots of interrupts) that it can't go through the vsyscall without at 
least one context switch it will never finish. Ok maybe it's an 
unlikely enough livelock, but it still makes me uncomfortable.
unlikely should be normally top level in the condition.
It would need to be rip >= 
There's a macro to hide the rip lookup

Not calling do_gettimeoffset anymore?
This means notsc won't work anymore. And the CPUID sync is also gone

Why did you move it?

externs in c code are still forbidden, even if they don't have

Has similar problems are the in kernel gtod

I don't see why this should be a thread and not a timer? Threads
are expensive and there are already too many

So why did you drop the __cpuinit for unsynchronized_tsc if it's only
called from __init?
