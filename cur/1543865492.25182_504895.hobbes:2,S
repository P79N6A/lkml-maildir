Right.  And what I wanted to do here is to zero out the uncopied part of
the page (if it wasn't uptodate), then run commit_write(), then retry the
whole thing.
iirc, we ruled that out because those temporary zeroes are exposed to
userspace.  But the kernel used to do that anyway for a long time (years)
until someone noticed, and we'll only do it in your 0.0001% case anyway.
(Actually, perhaps we can prevent it by not marking the page uptodate in
this case.  But that'll cause a read()er to try to bring it uptodate...)

The problem with all these things is that as soon as we unlock the page,
it's visible to read().  And in fact, as soon as we mark it uptodate it's
visible to mmap, even if it's still locked.

truncate's OK: we're holding i_mutex.
