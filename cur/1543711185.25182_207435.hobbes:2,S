It is OK here as otherwhise io-performance would collapse and hdparm -iI would show PIO.

APIC disabled in BIOS.
APIC not compiled in kernel. This board did not work well with APIC,
lots of spurious interrupts and delayloop-cal hangs during boot also
with 2.4 but have not tried in 6 months.

No (PCI,AGP) cards plugged in.

Dunno how DMA timeout is related to interrupts or are you suggesting it
is loosing dma-complete interrupts?
Same board runs same and higher loads with 2.4.2[345] flawlessly. Also
8 hours OK with 2.4.26-pre4 last night + 430 cycles of swsusp2.
By now, it happened with 2.6.4 four (4) times in 2.7 hours
IO is still at 20MB/s average btw so it is still using DMA.
