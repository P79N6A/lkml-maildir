Hi all,
If I mount a floppy image or an iso image trough loopback for example:
mount boot.img t -o loop=/dev/loop0
and then umount it with:
umount t
or:
umount /dev/loop0
The loopback module usage count stays 1 in /proc/modules
also I cannot mount another image thorugh /dev/loop0 cause it's still in
use acording to
the kernel.
Regards,
Hans
