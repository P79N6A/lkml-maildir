They _can't_ show up in interfaces unless you specify that stdint.h has to
be included before them... and I'd awise against any needless interface
fattening. Besides, using them in the kernel would then mean pulling in
stdint.h there... and you get the same mess, the other way around ("What
userspace headers are OK to pull in when compiling the kernel?"). Better
don't.

That's what all the _u8 and such are. Note that any name starting with _ or
__ is explicitly reserved by the standard (i.e., users should never use
them), so they are (relatively) safe.

Better use stdint.h where possible.

No. You just haven't commited horrors like the ones Linus showed. No
halfway sane C programmer would, but they are quite legal (and must work).
