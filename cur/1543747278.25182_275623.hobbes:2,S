I've said this at least three times: if you can point to a _specific_ 
thing you want to move, go wild. I think the big waste in this discussion 
has been that there have _not_ been specific suggestions, just total 
sound-bites like "wouldn't it be great to move things to 'include/kapi'".
If you have a specific thing in mind, say instead something like
	"Wouldn't it be great if we moved all the tty layer IOCTL numbers 
	 into 'tty-ioctl-nr.h', and made the old header file just include 
	 that header file, so that new libc users can get them from just 
	 that header? And btw, here's the patch."
then I might listen. Notice how the only really constructive thing to come 
out of this flame-fest has been a patch by Al that looked perfectly 
reasonable, but that got totally drowned out by the arguing?
Note that even _if_ you have a specific thing in mind, I want to see that 
somebody would say "yes, we'd use that organization". I would not be 
surprised at all if glibc people said that they can't really use any 
re-organization anyway, since they need to support old kernel setups too.
See? Changes that aren't specific enough, or don't actually help things is
what I'm against.
