Actually its the drives ON the HPT chipset that arent being detected, not the 
chipset itself.
usually:
HPT370: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 98
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:13.0 
HPT370: chipset revision 3 
HPT370: not 100%% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:pio
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xe008-0xe00f, BIOS settings: hdg:DMA, hdh:pio
hda: SAMSUNG SV0322A, ATA DISK drive 
hdb: Hewlett-Packard CD-Writer Plus 9100b, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
hde: IBM-DTLA-305040, ATA DISK drive
hdg: IBM-DTLA-305040, ATA DISK drive
<etc>
in 2.4.6-pre9:
HPT370: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 98
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 00:13.0 
HPT370: chipset revision 3 
HPT370: not 100%% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:pio
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xe008-0xe00f, BIOS settings: hdg:DMA, hdh:pio
hda: SAMSUNG SV0322A, ATA DISK drive 
hdb: Hewlett-Packard CD-Writer Plus 9100b, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
