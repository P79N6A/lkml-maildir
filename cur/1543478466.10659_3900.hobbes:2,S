Ok if things go to plan, there should be no more -ac patches until 2.2.0
final, where I'll put out what I think is actually going to be little more
than an NFS FIFO, large file array and a couple of drivers kit.
So I can concentrate on 2.0.37pre again can people send patches to 2.2pre
to Linus directly (and marked PATCH:) I know quite a few people were feeding
them to me instead but its now close enough to 2.2 final that I can't do
any more with such patches than bounce them to Linus, and Im a hacker not
a secretary 8)
