Hello Oliver !!!
What would you do in my situation. I am dealing with the Motorola MPC860T and 
my system has no disk (I use a flash), no mouse, no keyboard, no PCI bus. It 
has just a fast-ethernet, a console port and some serial ports. 
After reading the discussion on the lkml I realize that the only places I can 
get randomness in my system is in the serial.c (that controls the serial 
ports) and arch/ppc/8xx_io/fec.c (fast eth driver) interrupts.
What do you think about this solution ???
regards
Henrique
My fast ethernet is controlled by processor internal controler (called MII)
