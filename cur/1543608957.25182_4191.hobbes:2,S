Hi again,
As you know I am using 2.2.19.  I've recently been
thinking of going up to 2.2.20. Just wanted to drop a
question to those that use this kernel.  Have you had
any problems so far? How is it working out?
Let me know if you like or dislike, and for what
reasons.
thanx all,
   this is a terrific group.
