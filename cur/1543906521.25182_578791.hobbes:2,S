I guess interleave could be nice for other things, but for this, I
just want MPOL_BIND to work. The problem is that the pagetable copying
etc codepaths cover a lot of code and some of it (eg pagetable allocation)
is used for other paths as well.. so I was just hoping to do something
less intrusive for now if possible.
