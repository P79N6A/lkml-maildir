You know, I slept on it and I think I want to move the polldev into
opposite direction - to accomodte devices that need "relaxed" polling
and are ok with polling being a bit irregular and maybe even rounded
to next jiffy or something to better accomodate tickless kernels.
So I guess it would be better to drop my hdaps patch after all.
