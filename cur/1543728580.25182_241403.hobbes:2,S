First problem here is that the handle might still be in use
for mmap, so you'd need to undo mmaps on it. A second is that 
while you can ->flush() here you can't really close it until the
file usage count hits zero. 
You are btw tackling a really really hard problem and its more likely
the way to do this is to add revoke() methods to drivers and do it at
the driver level - as the tty layer does with vhangup.
