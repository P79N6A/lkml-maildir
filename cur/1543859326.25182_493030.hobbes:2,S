Andrew, Andi,
	I didn't hear any objections (or really, any comments) on my 
last release, so as I mentioned then, I want to go ahead and push this 
to Andrew for a bit of testing in -mm. Hopefully targeting for 
inclusion in 2.6.21 or 2.6.22.
Here's the performance data from the last release:
Vanilla TSC:
149 nsecs per gtod call
367 nsecs per CLOCK_MONOTONIC call
288 nsecs per CLOCK_REALTIME call
Vanilla ACPI PM:
1272 nsecs per gtod call
1335 nsecs per CLOCK_MONOTONIC call
1273 nsecs per CLOCK_REALTIME call
GENERIC_TIME TSC:
149 nsecs per gtod call
304 nsecs per CLOCK_MONOTONIC call
275 nsecs per CLOCK_REALTIME call
GENERIC_TIME ACPI PM:
1273 nsecs per gtod call
1275 nsecs per CLOCK_MONOTONIC call
1273 nsecs per CLOCK_REALTIME call
So almost no performance change.
New in the current C8 release:
o Synced up w/ 2.6.20-rc1
o Added a few small cleanups from Ingo
Let me know if you have any thoughts or comments!
thanks again!
