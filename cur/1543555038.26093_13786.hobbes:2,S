With 2.2.18pre21aa2 this little proggy:
main()
{
	int fd = creat("x", 0600);
	lseek(fd, 0x80000000, 0);
}
get confused this way:
lseek(3, 2147483648, SEEK_SET)          = -1 ERRNO_0 (Success)
_exit(-2147483648)                      = ?
I fixed it this way:

I've not tried yet in practice but by reading sources 2.4.x has the same bug
since doing the check internally to ext2 is too late to handle the 32bit
(non-lfs) lseek interface.  After moving the checks into the vfs (that seems
the right thing to do to me) the check internally to ext2 can be removed of
course (it was superflous anyways because ext2 file size is limited to 4T
that's not negative value in 64bit signed math)
