looks good.

that is not the problem. the real problem here is that the
vma->vm_pgoff is initialized as 64bit address. When
it is doing the shift_arg_pages, it supposed to be readjust to 32bit.
It did for newstart and newend, but still
used the old vma->start(64bit) for vma->pgoff. Here i make the change
to get the newpgoff based on the newstart.
