None of those problems actually matter, because you will have them
anyway.  If your filesystem is any good, someone will reimplement it for
Windows, Grub, UBoot, Solaris or some other system.  And even if it
isn't any good, you still need to stay compatible with your own
implementation from last year.
Ok, maybe code duplication is a valid concern.  But that will hardly
outweigh the arguments in favor of a userland mkfs.  The only exception
I am aware of is jffs2, where a newly erased flash happens to be a valid
(empty) filesystem.  And even there you can view flash_eraseall as a
trivial mkfs program. ;)
