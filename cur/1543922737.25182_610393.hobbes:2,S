- proprietary code
- unmaintained code
- code conflicting with existing kernel structure or policy
- code in which the concerned subsystem maintainers see no benefit
- code which its author is unable and/or unwilling to convert to
  kernel coding standards
- code whose author is unable and/or unwilling to defend it on LKML

The details vary, but the fundamental reason is always the same: to
maintain a sufficient level of code quality in the kernel. Point in
case, the recent discussion whether drivers not supporting
suspend/resume should be refused to merge.

Some examples, in no particular order: Reiser4, AppArmor, VMware,
the staircase deadline scheduler, the first version of ser_gigaset,
the Matrox HAL module, SuSE's "taint extension". Yes, some of these
are in the kernel now, or have been superseded by other code that
is, but that doesn't invalidate my concern.

That's certainly helpful, but I still think there will always be
a number of external modules that cannot be merged right now or at
all, and deliberately making life difficult for out-of-tree code
maintainers in order to coerce them into submitting their code for
inclusion in the kernel will not work, it'll only create bad
feelings.
Thanks,
