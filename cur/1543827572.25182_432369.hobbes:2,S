Agreed.  Hmm.  I bet I didn't see this one earlier because it is specific
to the unshare case.  In this case I guess we should either deny the unshare
or simply undo all of the semaphores.  Because we will never be able to
talk to them again.
Thinking about this some more we need to unsharing the semaphore undo semantics
when we create a new instances of the sysvipc namespace.  Which means that
until that piece is implemented we can't unshare the sysvipc namespace.
But we clearly need the check in check_unshare_flags and the start of copy_process.

As long as the appropriate reference counting happens it shouldn't be
a problem.  We obviously can't use the sysvipc name of the shm area
but mmap and reads and writes should continue to work.

A little user space program like chroot.  That takes a flag of which
namespaces not to share.  I have one around somewhere.  Just enough
of something that these interfaces can be exercised from userspace.
