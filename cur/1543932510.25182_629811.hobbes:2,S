Sure? Afaik that results in a bit slower access to memory and appart
from being able to address MUCH more memory doesn't change the
situation.
Perhaps I missed something.
And updating to 64 Bit kernel also implies changing the userland, so
a reinstall would be necessary, wouldn't it?

Some minutes ago the third machine of that type freezed.
with 7 GiB of *free* memory, before getting oom+panic.
The thing that looks pretty the same is that the inode table / open
inodes shrinked very heavy from 41k to about 2k before the freeze
in about 3 days.
Same kernel, same Dell 1955 hardware, different machine.
Is it possible to debug this issue somehow?
Nico
