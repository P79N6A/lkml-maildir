Where?  I believe the mm used to but no longer does.
They still aren't allowed to.  Consider:
	CPU 1			CPU 2
	=======================	=======================
	-->down_read(&A);
	<--down_read(&A);
				-->down_write(&A);
				   --- SLEEPING ---
	-->down_read(&A);
	   --- DEADLOCKED ---

See above.
R/W semaphores are as completely fair as I can make them, and they do not keep
track of who's currently been granted what sort of lock.  This means they are
liable to fall foul of the above deadlock sequence.
Any viable down_read()/down_write() nesting must be handled outside of rwsems
themselves.
Also, assume down_write() nesting is permitted, what do you do in the
following situation:
	CPU 1			CPU 2
	=======================	=======================
	-->down_write(&A);
	<--down_write(&A);
				-->down_read(&A);
				   --- SLEEPING ---
	-->foo();
	   -->down_write(&A);
	   <--down_write(&A);
	   ...
	   -->downgrade_write(&A);
	   <--downgrade_write(&A);
				   --- ??? ---
	   -->up_read(&A);
	      --- ??? ---
	   <--up_read(&A);
	<--foo();
	-->up_write(&A);
	   --- ??? ---
	<--up_write(&A);
