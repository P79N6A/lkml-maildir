Why not fixing devfs for that? My root directory is messed up enough. We 
have dev, proc, tmp, ...
We might have /dev/driver or such, which doesn't make the root directory 
any fuller. (And also not to disturb the newbies any further. It's hard a 
lot to explain to a windows user why he can't remove /proc and /dev, and 
what this is supposed to be.)
This is just my opinion...
Regards,
Thunder
