Out of interest, why the encrypted link? I can only imagine it to be of
use in setting up key pairs.  That's one time only.  Even then does it
matter?  All data is imported/exported/held on the server encrypted.
It's only deciphered (-able) on the remote.

Eh? You are suggesting that your entire session take place inside ssh
in order to protect you from snooping on the same machine!
Unfortunately, root can see you directly. You type ABC and root can see
ABC. Yes, he might find it hard to break in to your session (see
snoopd?). So what?

You're suggesting that root pretend to be the encrypted file system?
Does that buy him anything?
