Andrew,

The disks are both fine, they worked in other pcs without problems. The
ide controller card also worked fine, and the motherboard is new -
whatever you can expect with that. Maybe the combination is the problem.
I had some problems after running the machine for some days but I
thought that wasn't a hardware but more a kernel timing problem:

After starting the yacy daemon, it's about half a minute until the
"possible recursive locking detected" appears, and after one or two
minutes the whole thing crashes.
