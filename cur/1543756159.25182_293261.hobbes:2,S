I'm not too concerned about the noexec stack (PT_GNU_STACK seems 
to handle that well enough), more about the no exec heap which
seems to cause all the problems.  The stack change is not very
nice, but at least doesn't seem to cause wide spread breakage.
Anyways, you're right I double checked and the problem was already
in 2.6.10. I can just say that I didn't get any reports, maybe
nobody tried grub with 2.6.10 or they didn't report it the problem
properly.
Probably my original patch was a bit too radical too, just setting 
READ_IMPLIES_EXEC on all 32bit process unconditionally should be good enough. 
I still think it's something that needs to be addressed for 2.6.11.
Here's a new patch that just sets READ_IMPLIES_EXEC unconditionally.
It still has a bug that you cannot change it with personality()
without getting overwritten later
(that is a bug that was in the original changes, you would really 
need two independent bits for this). But I'm not going to change
that now so late in the game. It implies that you cannot 
use personality to force READ_IMPLIES_EXEC for a 64bit process.

Force READ_IMPLIES_EXEC for all 32bit processes to fix
the 32bit source compatibility.
