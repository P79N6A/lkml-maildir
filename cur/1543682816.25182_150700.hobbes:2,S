There is no pci depency in the scsi core or drivers.  The only
problem is that the dma-mapping.h implementation used by sparc
imposes an artifical PCI depency that needs to be removed.
If you want to help fix asm-generic/dma-mapping.h to be noops
if !CONFIG_PCI or even better make it always noops and add an
asm-generic/dma-mapping-in-terms-of-pci.h for those who want
them to map to PCI.
