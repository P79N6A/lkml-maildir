This patch should be ok by taking ``max_low_pfn - min_low_pfn'' and also 
becomes more accurate.
On those systems where physical RAM doesn't start at address 0, we 
should initialize min_low_pfn.
Anyway min_low_pfn is already defined on all platforms. The bug of 
forgetting min_low_pfn initialization
on those platforms isn't more severe than this bug.
