IMHO, we want to keep irq_stat aligned from performance perspectives. You
can never know if the info before and after it in the per-cpu area are going
to be cached (and thefore crossing cache-line boundary will cost us more).  
Anyhow, since that also accesses by other CPUs (not a lot...), I think it's
better to keep it aligned (the utilization of per-cpu areas is so low now
that it doesn't really matter).
