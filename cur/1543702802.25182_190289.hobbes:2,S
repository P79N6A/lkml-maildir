You didn't answer any of my questions. I'm forced to believe that the 
guest is either not properly patched, not properly rebuilt, or not 
actually the version that you're running. Not much I can suggest other 
than to recheck those things.
On the odd chance that 2.6.1-mm2 reintroduces a new version of this 
problem that the mentioned patch doesn't fix, you could try the host 
running stock 2.6.1.
Also, I inadvertently referred to stock 2.4.23, but of course you would 
have had to apply a large uml patch to it in order to compile it at all. 
Did you? If so, which patch, from where?
