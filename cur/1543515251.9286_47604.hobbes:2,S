I think my patch solves both problems:
* the overcommit race does not exist: the code never sleeps between
checking for free queue space and increasing q_cbytes.
I first load the message into kernel space, then acquire a spinlock and
(test for free space, add to queue, increase q_cbytes) atomically.
I know that you can slightly overcommit: each process that is sleeping
in sys_sndmsg() can overcommit by one message (ie MSGMAX), but I think
we can ignore that: it's negligable compared to the total memory for a
process (kernel stack, page tables, ...). The memory is recovered if an
interrupt aborts sys_sndmsg().
* Scott's DoS:
> +#define MSGQNUM 1024   /* <=65535 */     /* Max messages in flight / queue */
I use a simpler solution without a new limit:
sys_msgsnd(): 
-       if(msgsz + msq->q_cbytes > msq->q_qbytes) {
-               DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait,current);
+       if(msgsz + msq->q_cbytes > msq->q_qbytes ||
+               1 + msq->q_qnum > msq->q_qbytes) {
+               struct msg_sender s;
 
I reuse the number of bytes in the queue. This allows the user to
overcommit by ~ 3%, IMHO that's acceptable.
(16384 one byte messages eat ~ 512 kB kernel memory, 2 8 Kb message +
16382 0 byte messages around 528 kB)
