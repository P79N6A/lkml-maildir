Bla, bla, bla. The usual Andre Hedrick rant about how superior you're
to all other, threats and the cited hostility of "open source advocats" 
about everyone not their opinion.
You may be a really talented software developer with a deep under-
standing of the ATA subsystem. That does not give you the right to
insult all other people that are not your opinion.

Andre, I do this since quite a few years. I can live quote good from
it in my small vertical market and I love using free software for the
flexibility that I get. But this does not mean, that I will never ever
touch again a program where I have no source. I do this all the time
without and ideological prejudice.

I see the fine point of you using the word "me". Not "the Linux community".
