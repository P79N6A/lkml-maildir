Sure. But "hard time" and "impossible" are two different things. 
It _should_ be perfectly easy to debug this, by using
	signal SIGTRAP
instead of "continue" when you get a SIGTRAP that wasn't due to anything 
you did.
But try it. It doesn't work. Why? Because the kernel will have cleared TF 
on the signal stack, so even when you do a "signal SIGTRAP", it will only 
run the trap handler _once_, even though it should run it three times 
(once for each instruction in between the "popfl"s.
I do think this is actually a bug, although whether it's the bug that 
causes problems for Wine is not clear at all. I'mm too lazy to build 
and boot an older kernel, but I bet that on an older kernel you _can_ do 
"signal SIGTRAP" three times, and it will work correctly. That would 
indeed make this a regression.
