   Just a quick bug report -- I haven't had time
   to track this one down yet.
   Enabling DRM/DRI support on a Sparc64 kernel
   with Creator/Creator3D graphics does not build
   correctly:
I've tried to contact the DRM folks (specifically Jeff Hartman) on
many occaisions (at least 3 times) about the fact that using
virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt generically in the DRM broke the build on
several platforms.
As stated often, virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt are deprecated interfaces.
Yet, it is use explicitly in the debugging macros.
Not only has it not been fixed, all of my queries to Jeff have fallen
on deaf ears and I get no response whatsoever.
Franks a lot,
David S. Miller
