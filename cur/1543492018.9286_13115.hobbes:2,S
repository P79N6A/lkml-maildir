Aha!
The problem you described sounds very-very similar to one I'm having;
but in my case, it's happening with a binary-only application, so I
could not proceed to debug by narrowing down to simpler test cases :)
My findings are detailed in a post with the subject "of staroffice 5.0,
linux 2.2 and select()",
  [Message-ID: <priv$8dd116564$26f4d@lk9qw.mail.eon.ml.org>]
but the very short version that it seems to be caused by 2.2-pre8
(2.2-pre7 worked fine), and in that particular version, reverting the
select.c/poll.h changes to the pre7 version are sufficient to get rid of
the problem.  Can you confirm it's the same problem?  (I.e. by trying at
least 2.2-pre7 and 2.2-pre8?)
However, I'm more and more beginning to see that the select/poll changes
are not the "real" culprit, but funnily they are enough to invoke the
problem.  I'll continue to look at the rest of the code

Footnote: possibly this is what staroffice is doing also...
