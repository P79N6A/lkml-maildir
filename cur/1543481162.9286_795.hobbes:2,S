That is because the REAL def. of a Mega-byte of disk storage is 1,048,576.
Since the def. for memory is 1,024,000.
Many venders try to boost there apparent capacity by using the nomancature
(sp) game from math-n-science.  Where a Mega-byte = 1,000,000 and a
Giga-byte = 1,000,000,000.
For ease lets say it is a 10GB disk and all the assumptions are fuzzy.
The difference we are looking at is between 1,048,576 and 1,000,000
multiplied by 1,000 (or two orders of magnitude).
48,576 X 1,000 == 48,576,000 or 48 MEG (bad verbage), note we must now
account for total number of GIGs 10.2 and 10 for the example.
Since you appear to lose 48 Meg per Gig. and we have 10 Gig, the
resulting apparent loss in 485 Mega-bytes.
Recall "To my Knowledge 9789MB Not Equal 10.2Gig"
9789MB + 485MB (the missing mass of the universe) == 10274 MB or 10.274 GB.
It is all there, it is a sales marketing lie that many vender purpetrate
(sp) on the consumer.  Read the fine print on your Quantum drive and you
will see that they properly report the definition of a Mega-byte.

You just did not know the rules of the math nor the constants.
