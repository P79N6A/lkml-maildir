My reason for disliking this patch is that it adds user-space information 
to the kernel - in a place where user space cannot get at it.
In particular, any traditional cooperative user-space threading package
wants to switch its own stack around, and they all do it by just changing
%esp directly. The whole point of such threading is that it's _fast_,
since it doesn't need any kernel support (and since it's cooperative, you
can avoid locking).
The old "optimization" that you didn't like was not an optimization at 
all: it got the case of user space changing stacks _right_, while still 
allowing yet another stack for signal handling and exiting the signal by 
hand.
Does anybody do that? I don't know. But it was done the way it was done on 
purpose.
