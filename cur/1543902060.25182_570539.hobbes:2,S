Depends if Windows resets using this method, in that case using it as 
well would likely prevent the steady trickle of machines that seem to 
have trouble with other reset methods and need blacklist entries..
I sometimes think that with these sorts of things where basic 
functionality like reboot is broken, people are too quick to put in 
hacks to make it work and nobody looks into why it works consistently in 
Windows but not in Linux and what we are doing differently..
