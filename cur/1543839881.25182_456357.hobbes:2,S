I think that is still going in the wrong direction. Traditionally,
the macros in unistd.h were meant for user space, but we're now
discouraging that strongly (i.e. they are inside of #ifdef __KERNEL__).
The only in-kernel users on the _syscall macros used to by the
__KERNEL_SYSCALLS__ that we're trying to kill.
The logical consequence should be that we remove the _syscall macros
entirely, for all architectures.
UML can be converted to use the syscall function provided by libc
in order to call the host OS.
