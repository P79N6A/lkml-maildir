Yes, definilty, I 100% agree with you - I have _not_ disputed the 
priority list approach at all.

Ok, I've also talked about kernel component not user space one. User 
space approach with robustness, fast uncontented obtaining, etc looks 
very attractive but both kernel and user space parts have their issues -
though I took a glance to the project about 2 months ago.
