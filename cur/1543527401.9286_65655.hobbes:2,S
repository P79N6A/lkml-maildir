Subject: Will there be PPPoE Support in 2.4

Hello, 
In some PPPoE-related sources I read, that Kernel 2.4 will contain
support for PPPoE. Recently I downloaded the 2.3.46 kernel and tried to
find a driver in the sources but was unable find it. So I'd like to know
if it is planned that such a driver will be included in 2.4 or if one
still has to patch the kernel to get the driver?
Can anyone comment on this?
