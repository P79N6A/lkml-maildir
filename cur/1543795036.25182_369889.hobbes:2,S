hmm looks like we got some situation which is not desirable and could lead
to bogus sysfs_dirent in the parent list. It may not be the exact problem
in this case though, but needs fixing IMO.
After sysfs_make_dirent(), the ref count for sysfs dirent will be 2.
(one from allocation, and after linking the new dentry to it). On
error from sysfs_create(), we do sysfs_put() once, decrementing the
ref count to 1. And again when the new dentry for which we couldn't
allocate the d_inode, is d_drop()'ed. In sysfs_d_iput() we again
sysfs_put(), and decrement the sysfs dirent's ref count to 0, which will
be the final sysfs_put(), and it will free the sysfs_dirent but never
unlinks it from the parent list. So, parent list could still will having
links to the freed sysfs_dirent in its s_children list.
so basically list_del_init(&sd->s_sibling) should be done in error path
in create_dir().
Could you also put the appended patch in your trial runs..
Thanks
Maneesh
o Following patch corrects the buggy create_dir() error path. This bug could
  end up in having a bogus sysfs_dirent in the parent list. Now the newly 
  allocated and linked sysfs_dirent is also un-linked in case of error 
  resulting from sysfs_create()
o Many thanks to Steven Rostedt and Ingo Molnar for pointing this out.
