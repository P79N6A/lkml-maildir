Hi Dave,
I'm not too bothered about the subjects, but rather the issue that we
keep seeing this strict "only this small group, which defines the most
important people in the community" thing. Thats where I think the
current model fails, even if someone has done a lot of work all over
Linux for years, doesn't mean said people are the ones driving things
this year.
Personally I think Andrew's suggestion is really good, turning it more
towards the traditional conference means people who have something they
want to say are more likely to push for things. If one doesn't have
something to say, then going to the KS is probably not the right thing.

Thats true, and there should certainly be space for new subjects coming
in on short notice. However, I would suggest that at least a significant
portion of the summit applies this requirement. Most of the more
important issues are architectural and it's often not something that
shows up last minute.

Actually I'm in the process of investigating launching a mini summit
cabal, which I think would cover most of my current issues :)
Cheers,
Jes
