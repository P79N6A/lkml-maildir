That very much depends on the system. Having a laptop where the current
power consumption is around 10 Watts (or, at about 10 to 12 Volts,
nearly 1 A), having a resolution of 10 or even 100 mA would be OK.
However, on your cellphone with a standby consumption of 2mA, such a
resolution would be meaningless. What kind of resultion does the
hardware usually support?
And then there is the measurement error. Any ideas about what the actual
error ranges are?
Cheers
