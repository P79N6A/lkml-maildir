I think he means that his application saturates the 10Gbps NIC with 8900
bytes datagrams and it consumes 100% of the CPU while doing this, and it's
the same on the receiver side. I'm not surprized at all, considering that
it means around 140kpps, or pauses of about 7 microseconds between each
frame. Those pauses are too short to do anything else, resulting in the
task to appear as taking 100% CPU. But IMHO, that does not mean that the
machine is saturated; If the task had more work to do between each datagram,
it would possibly be done. Same if it had to send shorter frames twice as
fast.
