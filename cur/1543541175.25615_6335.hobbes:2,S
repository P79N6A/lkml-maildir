Earlier, I posted that my tape backups were being mysteriously truncated.
Now I know that they're being truncated to the tape block size.
That is to say, the block size detected by ide-tape.c is 26kB, so if I
want to get all my data back I have to write to it in some multiple of
that block size.
That having been said, I never had this problem before.  Is this how tape
devices are supposed to work under Linux, or is this a bug?  I'd hate to
have to rewrite all my scripts because ide-tape.c mysteriously picked a
different block size to autodetect one day.
Also, many thanks to Matthias Andree for hashing this out with me, and
providing some useful pointers to tape drive info.
