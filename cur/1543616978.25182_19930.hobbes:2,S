I am having the same problem since several versions ago:
Jan 13 15:15:48 antoli kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
It always happens when X is started on the kernel tainted with the nvidia 
module. But never gave any problem at all.
I've never reported it due the tainted version. But it seems it's not 
directly related to nvidia driver nor the hardware.
I have an ASUS/Intel815 motherboard (BTW, the 8259A is the Intel programmable 
interrupt controller).
Regards,
