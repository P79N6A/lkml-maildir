   I agree with your intent, but I'm not sure a common kernel interface
is feasible or desired.  This driver would be much more useful if it was
cleverly abstracted by a userspace library.  Should we try to make the
common layer be the library interface?  Obviously the more similar the
kernel interface, the easier, but I'm not ready to sign-up to architect
a generic interface.
   The ACPI interface could be used to do everything from switching a
laptop display between the interfaces to listing and configuring/de-
configuring specific pieces of hardware.  There will be a set of
functionality that's common across multiple interfaces, but I don't want
to prevent the usage that is very specific to the underlying
implementation.
