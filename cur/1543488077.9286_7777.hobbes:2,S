I'm a bit confused here. 
I have seen lots of code (for 2.0.x kernels though, but the 2.2.x
implementation looks similar as far as I can tell, using spinlocks
instead of a global cli) which look like this:
    volatile int condition;
    void interrupt_handler(...) { condition = 1; wake_up(&wq); }
    condition = 0;
    cli();
    while (!condition)
        sleep_on(&wq);
    sti();
which will be expanded to something like this:
    cli();
    while (!condition)
    {
	long flags;
        struct wait_queue wait = { current, NULL };
        current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE; 
	save_flags(flags);
	cli();
	___add_wait_queue(&wq, &wait);
	sti();
	schedule();
	cli();
        __remove_wait_queue(p, &wait);
	restore_flags(flags);
    }
This code assumes that sleep_on can be entered with interrupts
enabled.  If I put a sti() before calling sleep_on there will be a
small time window between the sti() and the __add_wait_queue where an
interrupt maight occur and set the condition variable but which won't
wake up the process.
Of course, the code ought to be rewritten as:
    add_wait_queue(&wq, &wait);
    while (1)
    {
	current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
	if (condition)
	    break;
        schedule();
    }   
    remove_wait_queue(&wq, &wait);
So either it should be possible to call sleep_on with interrupts
disabled or everything that uses this modem must be modified to use
the wait queues properly (the kernel only seems to have a handful of
these, but there are lots of third party drivers which would have to
be changed too, among it a lot of code which I have been given the
responsibility of maintaining, and I'm lazy :-).
While on the subject, what is the current recommended way of waiting
for an event?  Is there some kind of skeleton driver which does things
properly, addressing all the issues regarding SMP, multiple readers
and so on?
For example, if I have a driver which uses an interrrupt handler to
push data into a buffer and then has a read file-operation which is
supposed to pull data out of this buffer?
What follows is a code snippet from a hypothetical driver.  Have I
covered everything?  How should I do the timeout handling for the
newest 2.2.x kernels which have schedule_timeout()?
