A new syscall would be tidy, preferably one returning the binary layout
that Glibc returns to apps.  Perhaps it should take an extra argument
like BSD's __readdirx for future whiteout/unionfs support.
(readdir64 would not be implemented as a syscall -- you don't need 64
bit dir offsets).

It is easy.  Look in the new <linux/dirent.h>, at the
GETDENTS_DIRENT_D_TYPE macro.
That macro always returns DT_UNKNOWN for dirent records without type
info.  It is binary compatible with older kernels (and indeed the new
one can return typeless records too).
So all you have to add to Glibc is:
  user_dirent->d_type = GETDENTS_DIRENT_D_TYPE (kernel_dirent);
It will just work(tm).
enjoy,
