	My thinking here is that any ifenslave old enough (two years
or more) to still be using the OLD ioctl values is unlikely to work
with the current kernel driver, and if somebody did try it, it's
better to have the call fail outright than perform weird and
mysterious rituals in kernel memory.  I have trouble envisioning an
scenario where a user would be using the latest 2.4.23 kernel, but an
ifenslave from, what, 2.2.15? 2.4.5? or so.
	Separately, recent ifenslaves have compatibility code within
them to cover the great "ifenslave calling sequence change" from April
or so.  As much as I love the sleek new slimmed down ifenslave, I'm
not absolutely sure we can nuke that compatibility stuff within
ifenslave.  I really, really wanna, but I'm not sure if it will cause
problems for end users.  This is the upgrade scenario that prompted
the creation of the whole "ABI version" and compat stuff in the first
place; if we don't have to worry about that, then the simpler
ifenslave can be used, and I think the ethtool ABI version hack can go
away (since we wouldn't need an ABI version if there's only one).
