You seem  assume that adversary is on remote system. That's not neccessarily
the case.
Imagine you wanting to generate gpg key while I have normal user account
on the machine. I can sample /proc/interrupts, measure disk speeds etc...
Perhaps we are alone on [otherwise idle] machine. You still don't want me 
to guess your key.
