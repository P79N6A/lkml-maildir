Subject: Backout change to isapnp.h in 2.3.40

The change the attached diff backs out was made
in 2.3.40. It breaks compile (link) for eg. the situation
where you have isapnp as a module and eg. ne2k as built in.
With the change backed out, built in ne2k just doesn't
do isapnp probe and all is well.
