Ok, I've complained about this before, but due to the fact that you are
calling EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() only functions in this code, the ability for
it for someone to use the BSD license on it in the future, is pretty
much impossible, right?
Wasn't the openib group going to drop this horrible license, or are they
still insisting on porting this to other operating systems?

This is no longer needed with the class device interface in the kernel
today.  Please use the new api (basically just set dev_t in the
class_device, and you get this for free.)
