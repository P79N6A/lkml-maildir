It all depends on how many exceptions there are. The number of instances
of asm and volatile keywords is really small (one file each, on x86), so
we can easily decide whether or not they should all be allowed or disallowed.
For inline, we already have a precedent in include/linux/socket.h,
which contains
/*
 *	This mess will go away with glibc
 */
#if    defined(__GNUC__)
#define __KINLINE static __inline__
#elif defined(__cplusplus) /* || __STDC_VERSION__ >= 199901L  --arnd */
#define __KINLINE static inline
#else
#define __KINLINE static
#endif
This demonstrates that there are additional problems to consider. In order
to do the right thing, we could first use your patch to fix up all instances
of inline, and then warn about any __inline__ and inline, converting the
legitimate ones to __KINLINE.
Again, there are very few legitimate ones, unless you count the byteorder
headers as correct, which I'm still undecided about.
