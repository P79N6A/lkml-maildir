Whatever the reason, it's still wrong, because the problem remains: lack of
typechecking between the definition and its users.
It's defensible in one situation: where the definition is in assembly
language.  And even then the symbol can be declared in a header, if only
because a second user may be added.

Please.  Let's find a reasonably-relevant header for it.  If there isn't
one, let's add it; there are quite possibly other things which should be in
that header so choose with care, with that possibility in mind.
