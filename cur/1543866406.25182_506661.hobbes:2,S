No, your blacklight "device" is also a device now, not just a
class_device.  You want to show that heirachy properly for a variety of
different reasons (power management being one of the most important.)

Under the main device itself, as they are children of it.
As an example, look at a sound device now on 2.6.20 with
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED turned off:
$ tree /sys/class/sound/
/sys/class/sound/
|-- adsp -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0/adsp
|-- audio -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0/audio

There are a bunch of mixer and other interfaces, all now real devices
under the proper PCI device (sound added the "card0" intermediate level
also, but you will not have that for your devices.

Yes, if NULL is passed in, it will be created in the
/sys/devices/virtual/CLASS_NAME/ directory.  See the above "seq" and
"timer" devices as an example of that.
Hope this helps,
