You might want to try this too, Andrew fixed UPDATE_ATIME() to only call
the dirty_inode method once per second, but generic_file_write should do
the same.  It reduces BKL contention by reducing calls to ext3 and
reiserfs dirty_inode calls, which are much more expensive than simply
marking the inode dirty.
