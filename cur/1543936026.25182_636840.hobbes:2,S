Do you have any reason to believe this would improve things?  It seems 
like the problem lies in the NAPI/softirq code rather than in the e1000 
driver itself, no?

If we're not handling the softirq work from ksoftirqd how would changing 
scheduler settings affect anything?

Using userspace irqbalance would be some effort to test and deploy 
properly.  However, as a quick test I tried setting the irq affinity for 
this device and it didn't help.
One thing that might be of interest is that it seems to be bursty rather 
than gradual.  Here are some timestamps (in seconds) along with the 
number of overruns on eth0:
6552.15  overruns:260097
6552.69  overruns:260097
6553.32  overruns:260097
6553.83  overruns:260097
6554.35  overruns:260097
6554.87  overruns:260097
6555.41  overruns:260097
6555.94  overruns:260097
