-The directory ftp.inr.ac.ru:/ip-routing contains:
-
-- iproute.c - "professional" routing table maintenance utility.
-
-- rdisc.tar.gz - rdisc daemon, ported from Sun.
-	STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL HOSTS.
-
-- routing.tgz - original Mike McLagan's route by source patch.
-		Currently it is obsolete.
-
-- gated.dif-ss<NEWEST>.gz - gated-R3_6Alpha_2 fixes.
-	        Look at README.gated
-
-- mrouted-3.8.dif.gz - mrouted-3.8 fixes.
-
-- rtmon.c - trivial debugging utility: reads and stores netlink.

-NEWS for user.
-
-- Policy based routing. Routing decisions are made on the basis
-  not only of destination address, but also source address,
-  TOS and incoming interface.
-- Complete set of IP level control messages.
-  Now Linux is the only OS in the world complying to RFC requirements.
-  Great win 8)
-- New interface addressing paradigm.
-  Assignment of address ranges to interface,
-  multiple prefixes etc. etc.
-  Do not bother, it is compatible with the old one. Moreover:
-- You don't need to do "route add aaa.bbb.ccc... eth0" anymore,
-  it is done automatically.
-- "Abstract" UNIX sockets and security enhancements.
-  This is necessary to use TIRPC and TLI emulation library.
-
-NEWS for hacker.
-
-- New destination cache. Flexible, robust and just beautiful.
-- Network stack is reordered, simplified, optimized, a lot of bugs fixed.
-  (well, and new bugs were introduced, but I haven't seen them yet 8))
-  It is difficult to describe all the changes, look into source.

-If you see this file, then this patch works 8)
