Hi!
Andrew, in 2.6.6 shrink_all_memory() does not work if swappiness ==
0. shrink_all_memory() calls balance_pgdat(), that calls
shrink_zone(), and that calls refill_inactive_zone(), which looks at
swappiness.
Additional parameter to all these calls neutralizing swappiness would
help, as would temporarily setting swappiness to 100 in
shrink_all_memory. Is there a less ugly solution?
