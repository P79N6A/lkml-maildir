  I forgot to mention: try comparing 2.2, 2.4 and 2.5.
  Also, this is what I've been using to look at interrupt entry
point alignment.  On 2.4 for sure, and probably on 2.5 you have
a 1-in-8 chance of getting a pathologically badly aligned timer
handler on 32-byte cacheline machines every time you compile
(IRQ 0 entry address & 0x1f == 0x1c.)  OTOH the pagefault handler
has come up 8-byte aligned every time but I didn't look at the
source to see if it's coded that way.
