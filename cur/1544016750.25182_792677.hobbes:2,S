I don't think this affects your script but it's worth noting
that both bash and ksh use arithmetic rather than logical shift
for the >> operator.
Now arithmetic shift is not useful on 2's compliment machines,
and moreover it's compiler dependent as to whether arithmetic
or logical shift is done for >>. Therefore to increase usefulness
and decrease ambiguity, shells really should only shift unsigned
variables internally.
I know the opengroup spec says to use signed ints, but I think
that is intended to disambiguate input and output, rather than defining
internal operations. This is correct I think since the POSIX spec says
you can even use floating point internally if you like.
I asked the bash maintainer who said he would need clarification
from the austin group (CC'd) before changing anything.
cheers,
Pádraig.
