It's already pretty much impossible.

I would have designed it with CLONE_BLOCKALLSIGNALS and then set it in
the target process before unblocking signals. This would be in the 
spirit of fork/exec and also what posix APIs do for similar
problems (like pselect)
But of course it's too late now. We'll have to live with this
ugly thing.
Just hope you won't run out of the argument registers for the next
round of enhancements ;)
