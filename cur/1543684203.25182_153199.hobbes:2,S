I know. ...and this won't work. Think about this:
	- Some lib links (statically) some parts of libstdc++5.a. This
	  is done on a i386.
	- Some app (compiled for i486 on some other box) links against
	  the above lib (which was copied over).
Now, you've got two ways to access your atomic variables. Do that
multithreaded, and you'll boom.
It's all about "eventually" and "possibly", but you break binary
compatibility at some point.
