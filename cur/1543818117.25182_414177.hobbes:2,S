On a related note, I tried observing the rt stats in /proc/stats while running 
sched_football on 2.6.16-rt13.  The entire log is nearly a MB so I placed it 
on my website for reference 
(
http://www.dvhart.com/~dvhart/sched_football_stats.log
), an excerpt follows:
---------------------
The following is the output of sched_football run with 1 thread for offense 
and 1 thread for defense on a 4 way machine.  The ball position is irrelevant 
in this case since there are more CPUs than threads (they should all be able 
to run).  What is disturbing is that over the entire run, I never see RT 
tasks on every CPU.  Even though there are usually 5 total runnnable threads, 
we constantly see groupings of 2 and 3 on the runqueues while the others have 
no running rt tasks.
Looking back, I should have added a sleep to the loop - oops - still, I think 
the data is interesting and suggests a problem with sceduling RT tasks across 
all available CPUs.  Does this seem like a valid test to everyone?  Is there 
perhaps some explanation as to why this would be expected (when the cat 
process get's to read the proc information or something) ?
# ./sched_football 1 60
Starting 1 offense threads at priority 15
Starting 1 defense threads at priority 30
Starting referee thread
Game On (60 seconds)!
Game Over!
Final ball position: 20359767
# while true; do clear; cat /proc/stat | grep rt >> sched_football_stats.log; 
done
