Well, I'd suggest replacing *all* the non-process stuff in /proc.  Yes.

1) My example was implemented as a filesystem.  You could just as easily have
   a CONFIG_PROC_SYSCALL which implemented access as a syscall, ie. sysctl2().
2) It's not worth the hassle to save 7k of code (well, the final implementation
   will be larger than this, but OTOH, your replacement will be non-zero size).

You're right!  My code:
1) Doesn't have the feature of requiring #ifdef CONFIG_SYSCTL in every file
   that uses it properly (ie. checks error returns).
2) Doesn't have the feature that compiling without CONFIG_PROC/CONFIG_SYSCTL 
   wastes kernel memory unless surrounded by above #ifdefs.
3) Doesn't have the feature that it takes over 90 lines to implement a working
   read & write.
4) Doesn't have the feature that it's hard to create dynamic directories.
5) Doesn't have the feature that it's inherently racy against module unload.
What was I thinking????
Rusty.
