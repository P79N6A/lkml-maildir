	I don't know what "nscd" is, but I understood the point
that the shell was accidentally invoking some glibc2.1 facility
that had the side effect of causing the kernel to attempt to load
the unix socket module.
	My point is that under the current cirumstances, we should
make sure that modutils continues to build under other C libraries.
Yes, we could use ifdef's and wordexp, but it seems to me that it
would be more maintainable just to use glob(3), which should work
everywhere.  Admittedly, this is nitpicking about something that
will be three or four lines of code.  As long as the solution is
still portable away from glibc2, I suppose that is good enough.
