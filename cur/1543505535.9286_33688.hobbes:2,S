Well, I looked at the symptoms <g>.  
Alan Cox (as usual) found the problem and suggested the fix:

Seems that the IP layer in 2.2.11 will not register an interface whose mtu
is < 68 bytes.  Since the SB1000 was never intended for outgoing packets,
it had been traditionally advertising an mtu of 0.  
A suggestion to the networking gurus, shouldn't the kernel log a complaint
in such a case?  To silently reject the interface doesn't seem helpful.
At any rate, works fine now!
