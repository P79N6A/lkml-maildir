Just as a note, I filed the issue that this thread is about as a
kernel bug:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7516
I am also experiencing the port-mapping issue you mention with
the SATA300 TX4, but I believe that the port mapping problem and
the excess status messages are separate and unrelated problems.
