Hi Lennert,
Compiling cs89x0 as a module in 2.6.15-git5 produces the following
warning for me:
  CC [M]  drivers/net/cs89x0.o
drivers/net/cs89x0.c:186: warning: `netcard_portlist' defined but not used
No warning if the driver is build into the kernel.
I took a look at the code but it's a bit too, hm, messy for me to take
my chance at a clean fix. Still I thought I'd report is so that you at
least know about the problem.
Thanks,
