And it shares helluva lot of basic design. Which is all that matter when
you are working with it. You are not hacking or using the certificate.

No, it wasn't. Directories were different kind of inodes from the very
beginning.

Sigh...
	a) special filesystem might be nice, but not with the _current_
_devfs_ _design_.
	b) our VFS is not well-suited for mounting the same fs in several
places. It can be kludged with revalidate and friends but it means races.
Yes, procfs is not better.

Damn!!! One. More. Fscking. Time. I'm talking about _my_ problems with
devfs. I'm not a telepath. I don't have a habit of speaking for other
folks. _MY_ (moi, b...) problems with devfs are VFS-related.

Boga-dushu-mat'! No, it is not the only real problem. Just from the quick
look at the latest patch: there is an interesting race between lookup and
unregistering an intermediate directory. _Lack_ of rename() kinda sucks,
but it's not a VFS problem per se. But races between the operations on
different instances of devfs (mounted several times) _are_. And we don't
have any protection other than the big lock here - i_sem doesn't help
here. AFAICS the same applies to a bunch of sweet races between lookup() 
and (e.g.) rmdir() (in the moment of blocking revalidate on dentry).

devpts is definitely better. procfs ;-/ Kinda-sorta. proc_unregister()
sucks hard and the fact that calls are scattered over the crapload of
drivers doesn't make life easier. Sigh...

Yup. As for the good places for discussing that stuff - heck, Richard is
more than welcome to fsdevel. _If_ devfs is going to go into the standard
tree at all it will not happen in one huge gulp. Patch is too big and
affects too many places. Both devfs and the standard tree have problems
and I'm more than sure that Richard will not object to getting the patch
smaller.

> has it AFAIK. Why it's Ok for procfs and not Ok for devfs ?
	Procfs sucks. It's a PITA and will remain such for quite a while,
I'm afraid. It got into the kernel and too many utilities depend on its
current form to fix it fast. Worse yet, it doesn't have a coherent
interface and calls are scattered all over the tree + 3rd-party drivers.
Heck, that's one of the reasons why additional interfaces are not too
welcome, to put it mildly. They tend to stick. If they are local enough
they can be fixed later, but otherwise they'ld bloody better be good from
the very beginning _and_ remain so.
