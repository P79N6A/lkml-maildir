Okay, it might be able to share but in my case it ran into too much work
constantly. So frankly, it was not able to share at all.
(It was sharing the IRQ with the "pci holder for the irq steering" which
seems
to be on 3 different interrupts in my box. Atleast that is what Win98
reports.
/proc/interrupts does not mention such a 'device' at all..

(ps. Anyone know what a "pci holder for the irq steering" does?)
