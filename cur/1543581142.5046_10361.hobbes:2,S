Unless your machine is x86, and you use the binary-only HALlib from Matrox,
that is. :(
However, since the second heads of both G400 and G450 cards are supported 
in matroxfb, there's no real reason why the support in the 'real' XFree86 
driver should be so far behind. The main barrier to dual-head support in 
XFree86, last time I knew, was the lack of a way to _configure_ it. That's 
now been fixed, obviously. The HALlib is used only for mode setup, AFAICT. 
All acceleration is still done by the real driver. 
Petr - how much of the matroxfb code is yours to give, and would you permit
chunks of it to be reused under the XFree86 licence? Clean-room
reverse-engineering is such a PITA :)

I think that workaround wants to be put in place for G400 too; not just 
G450.
