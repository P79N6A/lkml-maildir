Everything does.  A dumb DC power source is a dumb DC power source.  USB is
no different here, *unless* it is using USB signaling to control the power
link, at which point it is not a dumb DC power source anymore.
There really is no difference beween an AC brick, a DC brick, an AC/DC
brick, or an USB port supplying DC power in a dumb way in a laptop or
handheld: they are all supposed-continous DC power supplies with a maximum
power budget.
But the "GUI should show it differently" part does make sense.  I am not
completely convinced a high number of top-level types is the best way to go
about it, though.  I'd use subtypes, and a comprehensive enough set of
standard types and sub-types, along with a description of exactly what they
are to be used for.  This will make it MUCH easier on the userspace side for
GUI authors, and it will be much better for people to not use the wrong
types when converting to the new class...
