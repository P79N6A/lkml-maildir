But it hasn't been prevented, just changed into a less destructive, but 
more prevelant problem.  If you want to try to solve the problem then it 
should be solved in such a way that it does not cause other problems ( 
breaking mounts when you suspend ) and the solution should be 
generalized to all disks rather than just USB.
