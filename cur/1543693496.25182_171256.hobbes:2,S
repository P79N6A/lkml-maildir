Thanks, but Kai Germaschewski did most of the infrastructure woark, I
just made the final stuff. He deserves credits more than I do.

I'm glad to see people having interest in it, I have notice several
architectures catching up on it.
A few minor comments.

I prefer the use of $(srctree), which is pointing to the root

Same goes here.

s#$(ARCH)#ia64#g is unrelated, but OK.
I assume you will push this to David Mosberger.
