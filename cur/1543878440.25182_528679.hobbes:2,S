No, it doesn't crash. It just doesn't show kernel threads (ps ax is OK).
I didn't look into the sources, but I guess the reason is that pstree
assumes that the "root" of the tree is "pid == 1" process.
I personally think this is acceptable (and Roland seems to think the same).
Still, to be safe, I'll break this into 2 patches, the first one sets
->exit_state, the second re-parents to swapper.
In fact, we can do some odd things to make pstree happy. We need ->parent
only because /proc needs some ->parent fields. But I'd prefer to avoid
these hacks.
Still, it is sad that we can't have additional flags for kernel_thread().
However, I agree with your and Roland's objections.
Oleg.
