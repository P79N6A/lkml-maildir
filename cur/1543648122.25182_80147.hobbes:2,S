I've fixed this already in my patches, thanks.

Uh, I must be missing something.
It looks like the ext3 change in fix-acl.diff was to revert a change
that I never had; it's not in the 2.4 0.8.50 patches, and it wasn't in
my patches.  So I'm not sure what's going on there.
The ext2 change in fix-acl.diff looks *wrong*.  It removes a call to
mark_inode_dirty which was there in the original, and which is
necessary.
Are you sure you sent me the right diff, or that you diffed the
correct set of trees/files?
