Not quite.  It works okay for simple binaries now, but still craps out
on running bigger apps such as gcc.
I'm using the gumstix (www.gumstix.com) myself for little endian ARM
builds, but they only have 64M RAM and no ethernet or IDE.  For big
endian, I use the Linksys NSLU2, which has only 32M RAM but ethernet
and dual USB (which lets you hook up a disk each.)
