Hi,
I am trying to fight the same issue for few weeks now, with no progress.
under windows sound works fine, so seems like no hardware issue.
under ubuntu 6.10, with latest alsa drivers, I get the message above.
seems like the kernel only see the modem part of the sound card, and not the
other part.
on my system, I can't disable/enable the modem in the bios, only the whole sound
card.
Any idea what to look for next?
Thanks, Shai.
