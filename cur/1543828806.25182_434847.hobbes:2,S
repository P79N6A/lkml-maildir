Subject: [PATCH 9/25] irq: Add a dynamic irq creation API
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/20/465

With the msi support comes a new concept in irq handling,
irqs that are created dynamically at run time.
Currently the msi code allocates irqs backwards.  First it
allocates a platform dependent routing value for an
interrupt the ``vector'' and then it figures out from the
vector which irq you are on.
This msi backwards allocator suffers from two basic
problems.  The allocator suffers because it is trying
to do something that is architecture specific in a generic
way making it brittle, inflexible, and tied to tightly
to the architecture implementation.  The alloctor also
suffers from it's very backwards nature as it has tied
things together that should have no dependencies.
To solve the basic dynamic irq allocation problem two
new architecture specific functions are added:
create_irq and destroy_irq.
create_irq takes no input and returns an unused irq number,
that won't be reused until it is returned to the free
poll with destroy_irq.  The irq then can be used for
any purpose although the only initial consumer is
the msi code.
destroy_irq takes an irq number allocated with create_irq
and returns it to the free pool.
Making this functionality per architecture increases
the simplicity of the irq allocation code and increases
it's flexibility.
dynamic_irq_init() and dynamic_irq_cleanup() are added
to automate the irq_desc initializtion that should happen
for dynamic irqs.
