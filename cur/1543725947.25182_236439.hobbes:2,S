Jaroslav and the ALSA guys...  no idea who maintains the ALSA i810 driver.
In any case, I think the device id constants are a waste, and have 
stopped using the *_DEVICE_ID_* constants in my drivers.  The vendor id 
is generally common across many drivers, but rarely does one care about 
sharing arbitrary name<->arbitrary id mappings these days, when one 
driver supports so many chips.
