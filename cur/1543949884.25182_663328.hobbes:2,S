Hi,
If it exists, it is well-hidden. A grep for is_paravirt on the testing
tree turns up nothing. Did you get the name right?

I chose to code it exactly this way, because it is what is used in
head_32.S to choose how to start the kernel. Or is this code not
executed at all?
[excerpt form head_32.S]
        cmpw $0x207, pa(boot_params + BP_version)
        jb default_entry
        /* Paravirt-compatible boot parameters.  Look to see what
        architecture
                we're booting under. */
        movl pa(boot_params + BP_hardware_subarch), %eax
        cmpl $num_subarch_entries, %eax
        jae bad_subarch
        movl pa(subarch_entries)(,%eax,4), %eax
        subl $__PAGE_OFFSET, %eax
        jmp *%eax
[and]
subarch_entries:
        .long default_entry             /* normal x86/PC */
        .long lguest_entry              /* lguest hypervisor */
        .long xen_entry                 /* Xen hypervisor */
num_subarch_entries = (. - subarch_entries) / 4
[end]
If this is indeed not executed, is there a way to detect whether
we can expect the environment to behave like a normal pc in terms
of magic addresses, bios areas, isa reserved address space and so
on?
Greetings,
