Totally.
Two more problems:
1)  In this case the decryption key is an intergral part of the software
and as such needs to be supplied as per fair use clauses.
2)  Alan's argument stands.  It is possible to fake the server and provide
the key once the user have pinched a working copy.  The wrapper can be
reverse-engineered for communication key magics if need be.
