I am not sure about the never occurs part of it, because we check
for the condition, so it could occur. I agree, it is a premature
optimization and could wait a little longer before going in.

I suspect they are all pending conversions to be made.
Eric is the expert on this. Meanwhile here's a couple of
pointers. Quoting from the second URL
"We don't need the tasklist_lock to safely iterate through processes
anymore."

 (please see incremental use
of RCU) and
