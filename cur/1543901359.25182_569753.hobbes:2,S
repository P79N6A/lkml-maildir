Are these real-life problems people need solutions for today or just

The Linux scheduler already gives you some knobs allowing you to adjust 
the scheduling to your needs.
What is missing, and why wasn't it included in the current scheduler?

Much is already possible, and e.g. when you talk about HPC you are in an 
area where the scope of the kernel is anyway often too small and the 
actual scheduling is done with a userspace batch scheduling program.
What are the real-life problems the current scheduler has, and why 
weren't they solved when it was designed and implemented?
People implementing a special purpose scheduler to fit their needs would
really not be an ideal solution - ideally, there should be one scheduler 
that handles all real-life problems.
And therefore the first step for people should be to try to get their 
problems solved with the one scheduler, and if required enhance it, 
instead of saying NIH and implement their own special purpose scheduler.
