That, plus we should provide a suitable i-know-what-im-doing user override,
with the appropriate warnings, as well as a printk which directs users to
this option when we decided to disable their device.

The power supply spec is a conservative minimum, whereas the device spec is
a worst-case maximum.  One would expect a lot of devices will work OK when
run "out of spec".
