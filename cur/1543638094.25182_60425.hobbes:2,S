    I have a Plextor 12/10/32 (just a bit newer) with a VIA chipset
on the mobo, and the only thing that is affected when burning DAO is
X Window. I've made a little test: compiling three kernels 2.4.18 and
playing the burned files while burning at 12x in DAO runs smoooooth.
In fact, I haven't noticed the test finish since the performance was
almost the same. But X freezes.
    IMHO it's a problem of X, not kernel :?? FYI I have 512M of RAM
and a Duron 850 (over 1700-1800 bogomips).
