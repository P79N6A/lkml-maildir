Yeah, that is a solution to it, and i also deplore that none has done the job
to make it loadable from userland. For now, debian is satisfied by moving the
whole modules involved to non-free, and this has already happened in part.

Well, i disagree with the above analysis. The problem is not so much that the
firmware violate the GPL, as it constitutes mere agregation, but that the
actual copyright statement of the files containing the firmware blobs place
them de-facto under the GPL, which i doubt is what was intented originally,
don't you think.
And *I* do care about this issue, and will follow up this issue with mails to
the individual copyright holders of the file, to clarify the situation.

Nope, i am aiming to clarify this issue with regard to the debian kernel, so
that we may be clear with ourselves, and actually ship something which is not
of dubious legal standing, and that we could get sued over for GPL violation.

Ok, but i hope that not only code, but patches clarifying the legal situation
will make you happy.
