Hi Russell!

And if we use ARM nomenclature there is also a difference between the
architecture (e.g. v4, v4t, v5, ...) and the implementation (ARM7,
ARM7T, ARM9T, Amulet, StrongARM, Xscale, ...) of the CPU core.
So we have to distinguish between the core and the SoC/ASSP
architecture. The register model is defined by the core architecture
but the co-processors (MMU, CP15) by the implementation. And should we
handle OMAP as a standard ARM9/10/11 implementation or another core?
And should StrongARM be inherited from v4 or ARM8?
Does it make sense to reflect this also in the directory naming
conventions? Hmmm, I am not sure. We could end with the complete ARM
company's history.
With best regards
