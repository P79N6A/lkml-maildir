... which gets done for you automatically if you use "make install" from
the kernel sources after building. In addition "make install" is nice
enough for you to add the new kernel to your bootloader.
(and no this isn't a kernel patch either; "make install" basically has a
hook for a distribution specific script to be run, which at least for
Fedora causes the initrd to be made and the kernel+initrd to be added to
the bootloader)
