Subject: [PATCH 7/7] Add documentation for extra boot parameters
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/17/114

Once all patches are applied, two new command-line parameters exist -
kernelcore and noeasyrclm. This patch adds the necessary documentation.
