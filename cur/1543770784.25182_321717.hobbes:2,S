As far as I know, it is software raid done much closer to the hw than
the linux sw raid (md).
There is a module (binary only) from Adaptec that lets Linux use HostRaid,
but from what I saw, it just worked with RHEL 3.x and some other ancient
RH releases. When I was installing RHEL 4 on an IBM xServer, I decided to
just do standard linux sw array.
