Actually, you don't need to reboot.
The mail/dns servers I mentioned are
running fine, processing smtp and pop3
mail without a hitch, serving up dns info
for 230 dns zones, and providing ntpd
and big brother services for quite a few
other linux and linux-like systems here.
You only need to reboot if you demand
that the uptime counter be correct -
I just add 497 days for now....
