Hello.  Just minor questions below.  Thank you.

OK, you can dispense with a store if the value is not used before another store 
to the same memory location.  So if, for some other reason, X = *A goes away, 
you discard *A = W.

Right, why include STORE *A=V on the first three possibilities?

What's Z see?  Or is that load what you refer to as the reason to perform the store?

Should these comments support the final result you provided above?  
E.g., X <- W may disappear in terms of your first note.
Thanks.
