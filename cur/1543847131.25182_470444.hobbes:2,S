It depends on the context in which the modem was suspended.  If this was a 
regular system sleep transition, or some other suspend request coming from 
outside the driver, then packets should be dropped.
But if the suspend originated within the driver itself, as a power-saving 
measure while the connection was idle, then new packets should cause the 
driver to wake the modem up.  That is, self-originated suspends should be 
transparent.  Outside-originated suspends are someone else's problem.
