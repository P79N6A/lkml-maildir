You're unlikely to hear anything dispositive from either of us on this. 
You three guys know far more than us about suspend, so it would be silly
for us to be making the technical decisions.  When cornered, we're more
likely to come out with general kernel platitudes such as "doing it in
userspace:good" and "crashing the kernel:bad" and "incremental development
with early merges:good" and "mucking up the kernel source:bad".
What we hope and expect is that you'll come up with an agreed path in
accordance with general kernel coding and development principles.  Linus
and I don't want to have to make tiebreak decisions - if we have to do
that, the system has failed.
Random thoughts:
- swsusp has been a multi-year ongoing source of churn and bug reports. 
  It hasn't been a big success and we have a way to go yet.
- People seem to be doing too much development on the swsusp core and not
  enough development out where the actual problems are: drivers which don't
  suspend and resume correctly.
- suspend2 is at a disadvantage because swsusp was merged first.  If
  neither of the solutions had been merged and if we were evaluating them
  side-by-side, suspend2 would have a much better chance.  This is a
  problem.
- If you want my cheerfully uninformed opinion, we should toss both of
  them out and implement suspend3, which is based on the kexec/kdump
  infrastructure.  There's so much duplication of intent here that it's not
  funny.  And having them separate like this weakens both in the area where
  the real problems are: drivers.
- Justifying the inclusion of a feature by the appearance and usefulness
  of the end result doesn't really work in this world.  There are numerous
  unmerged kernel features out there which work well and look great.  But
  we will look under the hood, and that's when problems start.
So, as promised, there's nothing useful here.  What we'd most like to see
is for Nigel to start working on in-kernel swsusp, merging up the good bits
from suspend2 in some evolutionary incremental manner under which the
kernel continually improves.  If, at the end of the day, that ends up with
us having a complete implementation of suspend2, well, Mission
Accomplished?
