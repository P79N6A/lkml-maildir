Yes, valgrind already has a pseudo-scheduler, a psuedo-threads library, it
delivers signals by hand, and it wants to run its client in a separate
thread so it can get out of the business of being an LD_PRELOAD shared
library.
This is all stuff that UML has, that UML does right (/me crosses fingers),
and that is usable by Valgrind (and anything else that's interested) with 
some repackaging of UML as a library.
Replacing Valgrind's signal delivery with UML's is a no-brainer.  Replacing
its scheduler and threads library would involve it creating UML processes
by calling UML's do_fork().  Valgrind would need to provide the low-level
switch_to, I think.  There are probably other things that Valgrind would
need to provide, but I see no reason this wouldn't work.
