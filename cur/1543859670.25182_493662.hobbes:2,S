I would tend to agree.
So the question then comes down to: is there really an issue with using
copy_*_user in fuse.
Bearing in mind that get_user_pages() simulates page faults in the
memory it is trying to access, we're going to either take simulated
page faults at that time, or real page faults in copy_*_user.
(I was just about to test a hacked up implementation of flush_anon_page()
on my test system, but it seems its ethernet interface has warmed up
too much and won't obtain a link with my switch... which makes download
of kernels impossible.  Hence it's going to have to wait a few hours for
it to cool down.)
