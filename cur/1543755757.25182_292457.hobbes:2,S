Well, the answer is to do add a "ARCH=um" to the build commands... you could 
maybe use a "make defconfig ARCH=um" however because UML itself, sometimes, 
does not build with allyesconfig /allmodconfig...
However, that said, there are bigger problems for UML.
Since of its particular nature, it contains some code which is compiled 
against userspace headers. For instance cow_user.c (the list includes 
*_user.c and everything that is explicitly listed in USER_OBJS inside the 
Makefiles)
So, for cow_user.c, when you add <linux/string.h> to cow_user.c, you are 
actually making it include /usr/include/linux/string.h...
For UML, you should probably add the prototype to a good header inside 
arch/um/include (those headers are in the searchpath for every file under 
arch/um) - probably the one which declared uml_strdup. Yes, we have had to 
duplicate prototypes for many functions... for inlines, we've had to provide 
in many case a non-inline version.
