Guys, 
could you please do a "make dep"?
Your tty_io.c didn't get recompiled when you changed the option.
Either you touched the tty_io.o during the year 2000 test so that it
will never get recompiled till next year, or you upgraded and
never did a make dep, so that make doesn't know about the depencency
on CONFIG_SX for tty_io ...
