Clients *are* expected to fall back to non-async if they are not given
channels. The reason it was implemented with callbacks for
added/removed was that the client may be initializing before the
channels are enumerated. For example, the net subsystem will ask for
channels and not get them for a while, until the ioatdma PCI device is
found and its driver loads. In this scenario, we'd like the net
subsystem to be given these channels, instead of them going unused.

No objections, but this speculative support doesn't need to be in our
initial patchset.

Well we could just define it to be chan_request(0) but it doesn't seem
to be needed. Also, the allocation mechanism we have for channels is
different from alloc/free's semantics, so it may be best to not muddy
the water in this area.
