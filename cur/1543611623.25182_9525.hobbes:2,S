Why, all fields are defined quite well. So usertools can easily get the info they
need based on 'column' number. If adding extra fields at the end breaks programs I
guess these tools should be fixed. 
RedHat kernels already have extended /proc/partitions: the sar patches...
It would ne nice to add these to the 2.5 kernel.
