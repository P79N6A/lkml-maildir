Except that none of the parties involved claim to have solved all the
priority inheritance issues etc.  "Releasing early" if it doesn't work
yet just makes you look bad.  There are perfectly valid reasons to do
kernel development privately.  MontaVista was doing just that and they
saw that some of their work may be duplicated so they released it.  I
don't see how this conflicts with the open source development process at
all.
