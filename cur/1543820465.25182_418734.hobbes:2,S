Hi Kumar,
Is there a datasheet available for this chip?

What "other devices" are you talking about? If the _bus_ is busy, it
might be caused by any chip on the bus. Resetting the controller may or
may not help. But it's hard for me to say more without technical
documentation. Can you explain what the CSR_MBB bit means exactly?
Please also explain the scenario you are trying to address here.

Yes, I like this.

Please try being consistent with your blank lines.

These last two changes are not mentioned in your header comment. What
are they? Why are they needed? They look like hacks to me.
Thanks,
