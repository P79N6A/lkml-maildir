Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/12/16/144

forgot to add that by default my patch compiles the kernel (and modules)
with -g. This is done because although in dynamic situations kdb is
invaluable, in quasi-static (when things change slowly and depend on
user's actions) situations I find it more useful to find out addresses in
kdb and then dump the relevant data structures nicely formatted by 
"gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore"
