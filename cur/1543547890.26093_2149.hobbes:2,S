more likely is that corporate America weeds out commercial software as a
model which was superseded by the free software. We (the creative anarchy
community led by Linus) are here to help that happen, gradually and slowly
without shocks and fits by those who love this world and the things that
are therein so much they choose to serve Mammon and make money on that
which should be inherently free (to wit, any form of information, isn't
it just 1s and 0s? :)

PS. If Linus objects to being a leader of such community, I may remind
that the keyword there is "anarchy" and that assumes that, to some extent,
the consent of a human to be or not to be its leader, may be freely
ignored by those being lead, without even disturbing the symbiotic harmony
between the leader and those he leads.
