a prototype for dynamic syscalls exists too. A prototype for pluggable 
network IPv4 stacks exists too. A working implementation existed for 
STREAMS too. Existence of a patch still does not make any of them a good 
idea for the core kernel.
[ If existence of a patch was the only criterium for upstream merging

  still be an obscure, niche hacker's toy somewhere on the 'net ;-) ]

i replied to that in my previous mail:
   But the kernel core, which does not depend as much on the physical
   properties of the stuff it supports (it depends on the physics of the
   machine of course, but those rules are mostly shared between all
   machines of that architecture), and is fundamentally influenced by
   the syscall API (which is not modular either) and by our OS design
   decisions, has much less reason to be modularized.
But to put it in different words:
   _certain core kernel code should not be pluggable_
and whether it should or should not be pluggable is an entirely 
technical decision, up to the maintainers of that code.

you skipped the bit where i pointed it out how different CPU scheduling 
is from IO scheduling. Plus now you are arguing against the opinion of 
an IO maintainer too? :-)
