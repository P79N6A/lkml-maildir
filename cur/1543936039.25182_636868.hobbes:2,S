I don't think that is needed or makes sense for reserved/ACPI * etc. 
Only e820 holes should be truly unmapped because only those should
contain mmio.

Why zero page?  Why not unmap.
Anyways you could make that a zillion times more simple by just rounding
the e820 areas to 2MB -- for the holes only that should be ok I think; 
i would expect them to be near always already suitably aligned.
In short this can be all done much simpler.
