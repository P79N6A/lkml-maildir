Normally the answer would be "Closed driver, complain to nVidia",
but just in case..
First I suggest you try the new drivers that came out for it today
first though, to see if that fixes your problem.

The recent problems were only in Alans 2.4.2-ac tree, not in the
main Linus branch. They should also have only happened on Athlons
that was introduced by the addition Cyrix III support.
2.4.2-ac20 fixes this.
As no-one else afaik has complained about Cyrix MII MTRR support,
I think this is an isolated incident, which is why I'm pointing a
finger at the binary drivers, but...
There is the possibility that you're the first MII owner to notice
that this is broken. Can you verify that..
 a. You have MTRR support compiled into the kernel.
 b. You have a /proc/mtrr file
 c. You can add/delete ranges using /proc/mtrr
    (See Documentation/mtrr.txt for info on how to do this)
If yes,yes,yes, it is a broken driver, and you should complain
to nVidia, not linux-kernel.
regards,
Dave.
