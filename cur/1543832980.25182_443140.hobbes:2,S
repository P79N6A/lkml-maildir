Seems like a good idea. I don't think this could be a downside for anyone
except maybe Ken Chen, if it adds any overhead to the noop scheduler.
BTW, IMO it is a good idea for the noop scheduler to do as much merging as
possible, especially as it could be used for things like network block
devices (but more merging may actually cut down on CPU and IO bandwidth
even in the local disk case).
