It's not that the program try to block the signal. It's the kernel that 
during the delivery disables the signal. Then when the signal handler 
longjmp(), the signal remains disabled. The next time the signal is raised 
again, the kernel does not honor the existing handler, but it reset to 
SIG_DFL.
