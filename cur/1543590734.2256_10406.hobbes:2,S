Okay, but another way of looking at it is as an instance of the classic
joke:
Husband:  What have I done wrong this time?
Wife:     If you don't know, I'm not going to tell you!
IOW instead of getting back "this file doesn't know what that IOCTL
means", you get "error somewhere".  It certainly would be nice to know
*which* parameter was invalid and *why* it was invalid.  Changing this
would be against the lore, but I would rather throw away excess
information than never have received it in the first place. *sigh*
