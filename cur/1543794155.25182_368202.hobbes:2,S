This has been one of the best -mm releases in a while.  No problems compiling
or running - and so far nearly 18 hours uptime without any surprises.
Following up on a posting from the last -mm release,  I'm still seeing errors 
loading multiple network drivers as modules (e100 and sky2) when 
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL is enabled, with 2.6.14-mm1, 2.6.14-mm2 and now
2.6.15-rc1-mm1.  Mainline git doesn't exhibit the problem, so it's -mm specific.
This is what is logged:

I'm certain that both of these NIC's are OK as they work fine with 
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL not selected.
With CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL disabled and an otherwise identical config, the
driver modules load up just fine.
A known good kernel with this config was 2.6.14-rc5-mm1.
I have backed out git-netdev-all but it made no difference, as well as backed 
out the e100 changes in -mm on 2.6.15-mm2, again no difference.  So I suspect 
it's not a netdev driver problem.
What else can I do to help narrow down the problem?  What other trees or patches 
would be worth backing out to try and narrow it down?
