As a general question about ram/swap and relating to some of the issues in 
this thread:
	~500 megs cached yet 2.6.5 goes into swap hell
Consider this: I have a desktop system with 256MB ram, so I make a 256MB 
swap partition.  So I have 512MB "memory" and if some process wants more, 
too bad, there is no more.
Now I buy another 256MB of ram, so I have 512MB of real memory.  Why not 
just disable my swap completely now?  I won't have increased my memory's 
size at all, but won't I have increased its performance lots?
Or, to make it more appealing, say I initially had 512MB ram and now I have 
1GB.  Wouldn't I much rather not use swap at all anymore, in this case, on 
my desktop?
