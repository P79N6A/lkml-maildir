No! The problem is that what he is trying to load is __not__

The "hint" is

This is, therefore, not a function within the module, but
something called, perhaps from a runtime library.
It is likely that all the other symbols like read, write, lseek,
etc., are also expected to be resolved by the 'C' runtime library
rather than being internal to the module.
