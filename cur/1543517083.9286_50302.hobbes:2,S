It's clear the LOCK has to be done at retire/commit time, simply
because you can't execute the LOCKed bus cycles speculatively.  Hence
the comment about all previous instructions needing to be completed
first.  For this to happen, they must all be committed state.
As to the rest...  in WB or UC, that is guaranteed by the program
ordering with respect to other memory operations/the observed memory
image.
I think they added the totally serializing so you didn't have to think
about the memory type at all.
