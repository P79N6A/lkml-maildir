That's why I thought I would be able to handle it!  :-)

It depends on what kind of race you're worried about.  In general a 
sysfs access that causes I/O isn't much different from a char device's 
read or write.  For such cases the driver would have to do something 
like this:
	drivers_sysfs_write()
	{
	 restart:
		mutex_lock(private_io_mutex);
		if (device is suspended) {
			mutex_unlock(private_io_mutex);
			icebox();
			goto restart;
		}
		... hit hardware ...
		mutex_unlock(private_io_mutex);
	}
And of course the suspend method would have to acquire the
private_io_mutex.  Some drivers might be able to use the device
semaphore instead of adding a new mutex.
I'm more concerned about races involving device registration.  The best 
solution I can come up with is to use an rwsem:
	drivers_sysfs_write()
	{
		down_read(private_rwsem);
		... register/unregister devices ...
		up_read(private_rwsem);
	}
where the suspend notifer callout would do down_write() and the resume
callout would do up_write().  Can you suggest anything better?

-ESUSPENDING would naturally imply that the caller should retry after 
the resume.
