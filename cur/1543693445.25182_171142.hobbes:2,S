If I turn DMA off the system won't be able handle the load we need. This 
problem happens under heavy load on different machines. It seems like 
IBM and WDC drives give DMA errors while Maxtor don't. But DMA problems 
are not quite related to the filesystem problems. On several systems we 
had the same ext3 problem while not observing any DMA errors 
(particularly Maxtor case). I doubt all those drives are faulty.
I may add that nature of our application is writing media data files in 
cycle manner. When filsystem gets close to full the script deletes 
oldest files. Usual filesystem size is about 80G, file sizes range from 
several kilos to 1.5G with average about several megs. The system can 
simultaniously write up to 32 files and deletion happens in parallel. 
Usual high load for the systems is about 4-5MB/s on writing reported by 
sar -b (not much for reading ~ 300KB/s).
Also what interesting is that DMA errors happen mostly at pretty low 
load on disk ~400KB/s.
A week ago I replaced ext3 with jfs on 3 systems and till now don't get 
any DMA or filesystem errors. I even was loading those systems with 
scripts constantly copying directory with ~4G of files and removing it 
for about 4-5 hours (avg loag by sar was 13MB/s for reading and 15MB/s 
for writing) and still did not get any problems.
So it seems like it's not the fault of the drives. I am still curious if 
jfs somehow puts less load on the drive not causing any DMAs but I'd 
like to spend couple of more weeks testing before claiming that.
