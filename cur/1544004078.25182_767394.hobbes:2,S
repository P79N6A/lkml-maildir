Well.  The problem here is the risk of mistakes, and such an ALIGN()
could still be called by mistake.

ALIGN() is designed so that it can take any scalar types as arguments
and still do the right thing, so it can't really be implemented as an
inline.

I suppose we could switch all those ALIGN calls which must occur at
compile-time over to a new STATIC_ALIGN() (?) which is allowed to
evaluate its args twice, then fix ALIGN().
A bit of a pain, but any missed conversions would reliably fail to
compile and would get fixed quickly.
hm, ALIGN() is used in assembly too, but it means something totally
different, sigh.
<greps>
./arch/x86/mm/hugetlbpage.c:    addr = ALIGN(start_addr, huge_page_size(h));
./arch/x86/mm/hugetlbpage.c:            addr = ALIGN(vma->vm_end, huge_page_size(h));
./arch/x86/mm/hugetlbpage.c:            addr = ALIGN(addr, huge_page_size(h));
These will presently be calling huge_page_size() twice.
Will these:
./drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:	ubi->ec_hdr_alsize = ALIGN(UBI_EC_HDR_SIZE, ubi->hdrs_min_io_size);
./drivers/mtd/ubi/build.c:	ubi->vid_hdr_alsize = ALIGN(UBI_VID_HDR_SIZE, ubi->hdrs_min_io_size);
do the dereference twice?  Probably not.
I didn't immediately spot any bugs, but I didn't look very closely. 
Hopefully if there are any there, we'd have heard about it.
