Hello,
Sorry if this subject does not fit in this list.
I am a bit worried about the development of the international kernel patches
from kerneli.org.
These patches are getting far behind on the real kernel distributions.
At this moment the latest patches are 2.2.18.3 and 2.4.3.1 while the kernel at
now is at 2.2.19 and 2.4.5.
There is now news to the public why these patches are falling behind.
I hope more people are consirned about this.
best regards,
L. Larssen
