You're reading too much into the name.  It's historical, and the reason
can still be seen in LANANA:
  4 char        TTY devices
                  0 = /dev/tty0         Current virtual console
                  1 = /dev/tty1         First virtual console
                    ...
                 63 = /dev/tty63        63rd virtual console
                 64 = /dev/ttyS0        First UART serial port
                    ...
                255 = /dev/ttyS191      192nd UART serial port
                UART serial ports refer to 8250/16450/16550 series devices.
When the drivers/char/serial.c driver was written, it was in the very
early days of Linux.  I'd guess that the major/minor numbers were similar
to Minix, thereby allowing a minixfs to be used as the initial filesystem
type.
Anyway, as you can see, defining chardev major 4 to be "8250_MAJOR" would
also be a misnomer because it's used for the virtual consoles, and it's
_that_ use for which it (probably) was called TTY_MAJOR.
(Note that in the very early days, this major also got used for PTY
devices.  Since then they've moved to major 2/3 and then we got Unix98
PTY support.)
