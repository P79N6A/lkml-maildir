Subject: [PATCH 00/23] clocksource update v12
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This tree is mostly cleanups . I move timekeeping code into it's own 
file, and I modify the clocksource interface to provide a more robust
API.
I've dropped some duplication off the hrt/dynamic tick patch set which
is all new to that tree and new to -mm. This is an -mm patch set , it's
not meant to go on 2.6.20-rc6 at all .. I'm modifying code only
included in -mm.
I boot tested x86_64 smp, and i386 smp, and compile tested for ARM
(!GENERIC_TIME). This set should be bisect-able for at least i386 and
likely x86_64.
It's also available at,
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/dwalker/clocksource/clocksource-v12/
