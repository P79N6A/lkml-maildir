So far, so good...
I can happily boot, halt, play some opengl games, perform my daily
routines, etc.  This should also be related to the bug recorded at
Mandrake-bugzilla: 
http://qa.mandrakesoft.com/show_bug.cgi?id=3198
 .
I also reported this to kernel@mandrakesoft.com .

For the record:
This patch posted by Adam Mercer solved my previously reported
problem about the mmio clash of CDM680 and GeForce3-Ti200 / 128MB
(see thread: "IDE siimage Problem" at:
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104773593910239&w=2
   disscussed offlist with Alan).
Very preliminary testing (no modules built, no initrd, only the
vmlinuz) did not show any mmio clash and boot was fine.
Dmesg and syslog files (gzipped) are attached. I may/will report
more results upon more testing if/when necessary.

Özkan Sezer
