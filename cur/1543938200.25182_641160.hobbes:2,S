Subject: [PATCH 18/58] [GFS2] check kthread_should_stop when waiting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/21/63

From: David Teigland <teigland@redhat.com>
Use wait_event_interruptible() in the lock_dlm thread instead
of an open coded equivalent, and include a kthread_should_stop()
check in the wait test so we don't miss a kthread_stop().
