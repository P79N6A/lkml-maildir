Well I was thinking along the lines of "device x appeared",
"device y disapeared".  Just general hot plug things.

So don't hard code them.  We need the device drivers to support hot
plugging and unplugging.

So don't assign names like usb0 (or just make it clear that they are
going to change if you move things arround on the bus).  The real way to
support this is like this:
Mouse pluged in and working
<pull mouse>
driver informed mouse at X unpluged, driver cleans up internal resorces.
<plug in hub>
<plug mouse un hub>
driver informed a mouse pluged in at Y, mouse starts working again.
For mice this only gets tricky with two or more, it's disks and other
things where we can have outstanding write requests on that it's tricky
with just one.  We really wont to hang on to some sort of serial number
and allow the writes to continue after it comes back.

That's all I was really suggesting ;)
