Michael,  my experience has been that 2.5.59 loaded up the first node before
distributing out tasks (at least on kernbench).  The first check in
sched_best_cpu would almost always place the new task on the same cpu, and
intra node balance on an idle cpu in the same node would almost always steal
it before a inter node balance could steal it.  Also, sched_best_cpu does
not appear to be changed in D7.  Actually, I expected D7 to have the
opposite effect you describe (although I have not tried it yet), since
load_balance will now steal a running task if called by an idle cpu.
I'll try to get some of these tests on x440 asap to compare.
