This LAPIC business is weird. I found two boxen, where the LAPIC timer
calibration is wrong by factor 1.8 and 2.3 on every third/fifth boot.
Unsurprisingly one is a VAIO with a CoreDuo inside, which claims to have
a 4.6GHz CPU and 390MHz bus speed occasionally. This problem seems to be
independent of the "lapic stops on C2" one. 
I have a patch ready, which should detect both problems, but having
acpi_processor as a module is painful, as we might enable the C2 states
way after we decided to use the LAPIC timer and switched over to
highres/dyntick mode. I need to find a way to back out from
highres/dyntick mode gracefully in that case except we can agree to make
the acpi_processor bits built-in only or at least make the Kconfig
tristate depending on experimental. Len ?
