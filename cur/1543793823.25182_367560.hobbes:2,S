Hi Keith,
I googled a bit on this, but the nature of the bug makes it impossible to 
search properly.
I found this out as I was trying to build Netgear router DG834 firmware from 
GPL source, and make dep fails.
The reason is due to the untarred path name that includes () I found.
I tested on virgin kernel 2.4.31 with GNU Make version 3.79.1.
top level directory of kernel source as a test:
linux-2.4.31(test)/
And the errors (with a lot removed) - it does a little first then:
> make mrproper
/bin/sh: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token 
`/home/nick/kernel/linux-2.4.31(t'
...
...
make: *** [mrproper] Error 2
> make dep
/bin/sh: -c: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token 
`/home/nick/kernel/linux-2.4.31(test)'
...
...
make[2]: *** [fastdep] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/nick/kernel/linux-2.4.31(test)/kernel'
make[1]: *** [_sfdep_kernel] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/nick/kernel/linux-2.4.31(test)'
make: *** [dep-files] Error 2
I haven't a clue if this is a 'make' issue or not, but a few tests on other 
source builds ok.
Nick
