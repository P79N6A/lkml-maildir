Hello!
I am setting up a server with 4 SCSI hard disks, two of which I will jumper
to have a delayed spin up as to not bake the power supply.  These two drives
will contain a striping RAID.  I am concerned that the kernel will load off
of the other drives and attempt to start this RAID before the disks have
even spun up - is there a way to have the kernel delay its startup for a
certain number of seconds while all the drives spin up?
Any hints are greatly appreciated.
Mark
