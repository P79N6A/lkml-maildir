Somewhat... userspace doesn't and workqueues are a gray area.
Also, I've been thinking this "icebox" idea a bit more and it seems in
fact a bit racy in some areas, at least for use by things like drivers,
unless we end up doing something aking to an RCU on suspend, waiting for
all tasks to reach userland once, but that has the same annoyances as
the current freezer.
Thus I'm tempted to go back to saying that driver can handle things
locally :-)
