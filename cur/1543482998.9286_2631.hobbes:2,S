If you remove the kernel lock around do_exit() you _need_ my mm_lock
spinlock. You need it to make atomic the decreasing of mm->count and
current->mm = &init_mm. If the two instructions are not atomic you have
_no_ way to know if you can mmget() at any time the mm of a process.
I repeat in another way (just trying to avoid English mistakes): 
decreasing mm->count has to go in sync with updating current->mm,
otherwise you don't know if you can access the mm of a process (and so
also touching mm->count) because the mm of such process could be just been
deallocated (the process could be a zombie).
As far I can see the mm->count will _never_ have 1 reason to be atomic_t
even removing the function lock_kernel() from
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/smplock.h . 
Using an int for mm->count (isntead of atomic_t) is far from be something
of magic. Doing that change it means that I don't expect work by magic,
but I know that it will work fine. It's instead magic (out of the human
reason) how the kernel works now, if you think that we _need_ atomic_t
instead of int. 
It's hard for me to be quiet even if you asked me to go away because I
think you are plain wrong telling that we need mm->count atomic_t for the
future.

PS. You have not hurted me asking me to go away, because I _always_ do the
_best_ I _can_, and if my best is plain wrong I can't change this reality. 
What I care is to do the best I can. Maybe I should really go away and do
something in my sparetime where it's not requested to be clever... I hope
it's not the case though and that you wasn't serious.
