You need a new mechanism to cope with low memory situations because the 
drivers can tie up quite a bit of memory (in fact you gave up unified
memory management).

If you need such a horror it just means there is something wrong with slab.
Better fix slab.
4) Better support for aligned RX by only copying the header, no the whole
packet, to end up with an aligned IP header. Unless the driver knows about
all protocol lengths this means the stack needs to support "parse header
in this buffer, then switch to other buffer with computed offset for data"
