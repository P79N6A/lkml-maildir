You may want to look at the FreeS/WAN code which does IPSEC network
encryption for Linux:
http://www.freeswan.org
and/or at the mailing list archive for it, which include extensive
discussion of various complications encountered in interactions
between adding encryption headers, changed packet sizes, path MTU
discovery, ICMP, packet filtering, ...
http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/linux-ipsec/
There are also half a dozen other projects doing more-or-less similar
things. Links to all the ones I know of are in FreeS/WAN docs:
http://www.freeswan.org/freeswan_trees/freeswan-1.3/doc/WWWref.html#alternatives
Send me a link for yours if it is far enough along.
