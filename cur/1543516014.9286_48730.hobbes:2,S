Hi Robert.

Yours is secondary master, mine's secondary slave, but nothing wrong
with the actual entries. The only thing I would point out is that the
nosuid is redundant as user sets that - and even if it said suid, it
would be redundant if it comes before user in the list.

Thinking about it, there shouldn't be any problems caused by just
grabbing the kernel rpm's from 6.1 and using them with 6.0.
Alan: Are you aware of any likely problems from doing this?
Here's the relevant listing direct from ftp.redhat.com's master

Basically, download the lot into ~ftp/pub on one of the systems, then
run the following command...
 Q> rpm -Fvh ~ftp/pub/kernel*.rpm
...and it'll upgrade all the ones installed on that machine without
installing any that aren't currently installed.

Often the case. I can claim to be responsible for introducing Linux
into a large secondary school in Lincolnshire, England, and it was
near enough an accident that I even got involved with it, but the Head
of Information Technology is now very enthusiastic about Linux when he
hadn't even heard of it 18 months ago...

Accepted 8-)
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
