The beta 3 release 0.3.0 of JFS was made available today.
The file system has fixes included.
Both the file system and the utilities have been changed to use
the system endian macros,so that JFS will now store the meta-data
as little endian when running on all architectures.
For more details about the problems fixed, please see the README.
