If a fail-safe applicaion is running on a system which is that close
to the edge in terms of available physical memory and swap, it's not
likely going to be in deep trouble anyway.  Even if you disable the
OOM killer, now random malloc()'s will start returning NULL because
your system doesn't have enough memory.  Do you have intelligent error
handling and recovery mechanisms for every single malloc() failure?
Also, the machine will likely be thrashing so badly that any service
level performance guarantees that the application might have will
probably be totally trashed.
