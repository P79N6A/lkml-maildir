The kernel should display these messages even without my patch.

I doubt it is my patch that makes your laptop work. C1E detection was
added by the following commit:
$ git-describe fb79d22e1d4b06385796cc0db0084a2e07beccee
v2.6.23-2294-gfb79d22
Try building a 2.6.24-rc6 without my patch and see if it still works
(apply it again in reverse mode, for example). I guess it will work,
because the kernel shouldn't use the LAPIC as a timer at all (except as
a dummy one), with or without dynticks support.
When I started investigating the "nohz is not working problem", I
stumbled across a few threads on LKML where a few people had
similar problems with their laptops and they where instructed to pass
"nolapic" or something similar as a boot parameter to the kernel. I
guess the problem disappeared after the commit I mentioned previously,
since such reports weren't that recent. IIRC, that was on kernels
previous to 2.6.24-*, where x86 and x86-64 weren't unified and there
were no dynticks on the latter.
To be more clear, my patch disables C1E instead of disabling the
LAPIC, as these two don't agree with each other.
