cat /proc/partitions
This gives the partition sizes.  It may not be enough as you don't
get the exact placement, but it worked for me when I did exactly the 
same thing.  I used fdisk and recreated my partitions in order
and with exactly the same sizes.  Note that cfdisk will want to
start the first partition on a cylinder bounddary,
while fdisk can start on a track boundary.  The latter was necessary
in my case, as an NT partition started on the second track 
on the first cylinder.
Before you reboot, make sure you have a linux boot floppy with
fdisk on it.  A debian install/rescue diskette is ok.
You can then rery if your first attempt goes wrong.
