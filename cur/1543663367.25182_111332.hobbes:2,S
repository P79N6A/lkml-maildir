Good question.
I had thought obviously not, 2.4 prune_icache doesn't __iget and
drop inode_lock as 2.5 does (while invalidating buffers and pages).
Looks like 2.4 leaves that work to the subsequent dispose_list's
truncate_inode_pages.
But that raises the doubt: maybe 2.4 won't get any Self-destruct
message, but when prune_icache calls dispose_list calls clear_inode
and destroy_inode, there could be a reference to freed super_block?
Perhaps there's some other reason why not,
I'll check it out more carefully later.
