Alan, quite right, at least that it makes no difference. Recompiled
2.2.15.pre10 with the old gcc late this afternoon, set the
tcp_keepalive_time to 60 (seconds) in hopes of triggering a crash while I
was around, and by midevening, voila, the same crash. At the time there
were two tcp sockets open, one to the machine on which I was watching
"netstat -tc" for the server, and one for sendmail which was attempting to
pass on a message to a nonresponsive system, as this shows:
tcp        0      1 china.patternbook.:1264 b.nonamecorp.com:smtp   SYN_SENT    
tcp        0      0 china.patternboo:telnet whit.transpect.com:1136 ESTABLISHED 
(those two lines repeated up off the screen in the buffer)
and the maillog on that one looked like this:
Mar  1 19:56:02 china sendmail[2028]: QAA01576: to=Tom Campbell
<Tom.campbell@sid.net>, delay=03:21:16, xdelay=00:13:10, mailer=esmtp,
relay=puffy.noname.com. [216.112.75.129], stat=Deferred: Connection timed
out with puffy.noname.com.
So I'll set tcp_keepalive_time back to insanity, and revel in stability.
Whit
