Most RAID controllers work like a standard IDE or SCSI unit in normal
operation, but they generally have a proprietary management interface
(including the Storageworks range). Without this its between difficult and
impossible to configure the RAID set, or to manage recovery after a drive
swap, and you don't get effective reporting of a drive failure.
