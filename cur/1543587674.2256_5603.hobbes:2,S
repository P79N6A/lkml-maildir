I wonder if someone at VIA even knows what is going on.  In working
with linuxBIOS Ron Minnich was worked with VIA to get it up on some of
their chipsets. He ran into a few cases where his code wouldn't work,
he'd show it to the engineers at VIA and they also wouldn't have a
clue why his code was failing.  And that it looked like only Award
knew how the chipset really worked.  This is northbridge code not
southbridge code so it may be an entirely different ball game but...
Anyway Alan you might want to bounce off Ron.  He might have a clue
how to help you get get VIA's attention...
