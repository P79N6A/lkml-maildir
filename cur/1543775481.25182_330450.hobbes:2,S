How?  It either blocks other allocations until the writeback is
completed (DoS) or allows memory to be exhausted (deadlock).
Making unpriv mounts work securely is not a trivial thing I can tell
you ;)

With a custom userspace NFS server you can do whatever you want.
That's the whole purpose of the exercise.

It's often not.  Sshfs is a good example.  File server will not be
able to notify the client when anything changes.  Polling is the only
solution, and NFS doesn't always get it right (and in fact it cannot).
It's much better to leave cache timeout policy to the userspace
filesystem, then trying to guess it in the kernel.

I'm not sure.  NFS is a monster, everybody can agree.  Getting all the
requirements of FUSE (safe unprivileged mounts, etc) would be a
nightmare.
FUSE does one thing, and it does that right.  I think that's good.
