I use this Belkin one which has a RaLink chipset -
http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=179211
 
It is not .11n but I never had any problems with Fedora 8 or Ubuntu 7.10 - 
well apart from fiddling with module blacklists that is. (This card is 
claimed by two drivers in the kernel and the one that gets loaded does not 
work - so I have to blacklist it.) But apart from that it just works - 
even with NetWorkManager.
Recently I was hunting for a .11n USB card that works with Linux without 
the ndiswrapper crap but wasn't able to find one.
You want to make sure though that you get the Ralink chipset with the card 
revision you buy - similarly named different version cards having totally 
different chipsets is not considered weird in that world.
