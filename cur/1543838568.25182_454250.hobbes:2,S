There are two separate memory areas here: Your own metadata used by the
allocator and the memory used for skb data.
avl_node_array[cpu] and avl_container_array[cpu] are only designed to
be accessed only by the local cpu, so these should be done like
avl_node_array[cpu] = kmalloc_node(AVL_NODE_PAGES * sizeof(void *),
			GFP_KERNEL, cpu_to_node(cpu));
or you could make the whole array DEFINE_PER_CPU(void *, which would
waste some space in the kernel object file.
Now for the actual pages you get with __get_free_pages(), doing the
same (alloc_pages_node), will help accessing your avl_container 
members, but may not be the best solution for getting the data
next to the network adapter.
