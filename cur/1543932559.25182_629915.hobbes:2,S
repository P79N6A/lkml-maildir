Hi,
Sorry for repeating but as far as i can see 2.6.23.11/12 got no changes 
into NFS.
I've run into this problem 2.6.23.9. The open syscall will return 
"Invalid argument" when O_TRUNC is set on existing files.
The same file can be opened for append or removed.
The evidence is for example:
mars:~# mount localhost:/opt/nfs/ /mnt/tmp
mars:~# echo "Hello" > /mnt/tmp/test-file
mars:~# echo "Hello" > /mnt/tmp/test-file
bash: /mnt/tmp/test-file: Invalid argument
mars:~# echo "Hello" > /mnt/tmp/test-file
bash: /mnt/tmp/test-file: Invalid argument
mars:~# echo "Hello" > /mnt/tmp/test-file
bash: /mnt/tmp/test-file: Invalid argument
mars:~# rm /mnt/tmp/test-file
mars:~# echo "Hello" > /mnt/tmp/test-file
mars:~# echo "Hello" > /mnt/tmp/test-file
bash: /mnt/tmp/test-file: Invalid argument
This is not present in 2.6.21.7.
This is really ugly...is this a bug or what ?
TIA
