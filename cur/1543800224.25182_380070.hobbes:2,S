one question is, what do the kernel addresses visible in the first 
argument of asm_do_IRQ() correspond to:
 trace1:MyThread-153   0D..1 5977us+: asm_do_IRQ (c030c170 1a 0)
 trace1:MyThread-153   0D..1 15191us+: asm_do_IRQ (c030c1bc 1a 0)
 trace2:  <idle>-0     0D..2 8822us+: asm_do_IRQ (c021da24 1a 0)
 trace2:  <idle>-0     0Dn.2 8920us+: asm_do_IRQ (c021da24 b 0)
 trace3:     top-169   0D..1 8802us+: asm_do_IRQ (c024e5fc 1a 0)
 trace4:  insmod-185   0D..1 8794us+: asm_do_IRQ (c030c174 1a 0)
 trace5:      dd-197   0D..1 8812us+: asm_do_IRQ (c02e4938 1a 0)
 trace6: kthread-11    0d..3 2670us+: asm_do_IRQ (c02fe2d0 1a 0)
 trace7:MyThread-95    0D..1  542us+: asm_do_IRQ (c02fe2d0 1a 0)
 trace7:MyThread-95    0D..1 9755us+: asm_do_IRQ (c02fe2d0 1a 0)
i.e. what is c02fe2d0, c021da24, c02e4938, etc.?
but it seems most of the latencies are printk related: one possibility 
is that something is doing a costly printk with preemption disabled.
