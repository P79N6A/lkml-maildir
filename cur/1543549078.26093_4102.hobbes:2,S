Hi,
This patch against 2.2.18-pre9 moves the USB input drivers into the same
directory structure that they are in for 2.4.x, and it also updates the
drivers to their latest versions.
This patch was done by Franz Sirl (thanks Franz for doing this!)
I've included it in two forms here:
  usb-input-2.2.18-pre9.diff.gz : a single patch that does everything
				  needed.
  usb-input-2.2.18-pre9-multiple.tar.gz : A three patch sequence that
					  accomplishes the same thing,
					  but in clean steps (first move
					  the drivers, then patch them,
					  and then patch them again.)
Thanks,
greg k-h
