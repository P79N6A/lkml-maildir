Hello Andrew,
we have announced UBI several months ago in the MTD mailing list. It was
successfully used in our setup and we've got positive feedback.
In short, it is kind of LVM layer but for flash (MTD) devices which
hides flash devices complexities like bad eraseblocks (on NANDs) and
wear. The documentation is available at the MTD web site:
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/doc/ubi.html
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/faq/ubi.html
The source code is available at the UBI GIT tree:
git://git.infradead.org/home/dedekind/ubi-2.6.git
The UBI GIT tree is based upon the mtd-2.6.git
(git://git.infradead.org/mtd-2.6.git)
Plain patches may be found at
http://linux-mtd.infradead.org/~dedekind/ubi/
Please, include the patches to your tree.
