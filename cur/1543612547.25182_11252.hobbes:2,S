Greetings.
	I run Linux on an IBM PC300GL with Intel's
82371AB PIIX4 chipset. With DMA enabled (by doing a
hdparm -d1 /dev/hda) on the hdd, I
_sometimes_ get the following message from the kernel
after resuming from APM standby mode:
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hda: status error: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest
Error }
hda: status error: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hda: drive not ready for command
then the drive stalls for a few seconds, and the driver
disables DMA. This behaviour doesn't seem to depend on the
kernel version (current: 2.4.14; error seen with 2.2 series also.)
The weird thing is that this is not reliably reproducable; most of
the time the system goes to apm standby (not suspend) and resumes fine.
Other (possibly relevent) boot-time messages (in order
of appearance):
IBM machine detected. Enabling interrupts during APM calls.
