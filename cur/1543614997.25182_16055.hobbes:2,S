Yeah.  In order for -fno-common to not blow up the UML build (because of the
clash between libc errno and kernel errno), I had to add -Derrno=kernel_errno
to all the kernel file compiles.  It would be nice to get rid of that wart.

Awesome.  This definitely needs to happen.  If no one spots any breakage,
send it in...

I did some grepping and the only problem I noticed was UML's execve (heh)
converting a -errno return to a -1.
