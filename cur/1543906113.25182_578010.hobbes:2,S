I would disagree on at least one level. The KGDB tree is broken up into 
incremental units each layer adding more functionality and or arch 
specific pieces.
As an example, the KGDB core itself is:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jwessel/linux-2.6-kgdb.git;a=commit;h=53956620b1b293300c5ae99a783cf6a7ce8175f9
If you can point to some specific examples vs a blanket statement "is 
quite messy" perhaps I can explain what the changes are for and why they 
are needed.
Jason.
