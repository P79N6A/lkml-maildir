Yes, the problem persists.
Interesting that it seems to happen on a variety of Ethernet cards, I
wonder if the problem's in the TCP area.  Interestingly it seems like on
the *unafflicted* systems I can still see the "delayed character" symptom,
but eventually the outstanding characters do get echoed back to the
screen.  Whereas on the afflicted 2.5.5x systems, as soon as there is a
delay (perhaps due to a retransmission) all outstanding characters (after 
the delayed one) are lost or permanently hung up somewhere.
