I do not think it would fail. Like this:
# df
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/home     208486056 158605472  49880584  77% /home
# mount /dev/mapper/home /mnt
# df
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/home     208486056 158605472  49880584  77% /home
/dev/mapper/home     208486056 158605472  49880584  77% /mnt
