serial console, netconsole, console on line-printer  are all useful

I've tried to reproduce the Oops here with your config, but my
hardware is too different to match your config, so I had to make some
changes to get the kernel running. In the end I was not able to
reproduce it.

Can you reproduce the crash with a non-tainted kernel?
