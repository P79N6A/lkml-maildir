maybe this: open("/some/dir", O_TMPFILE);
and this? open("/some/dir", O_TMPFILE|O_DIRECTORY);
The former would return a filehandle to a new anonymous file  
somewhere on whatever filesystem backs the specified path.  The  
latter would do the same, except create an anonymous directory where  
you could use "openat()" or something.  Presumably "lsof" and "/proc"  
should show either type of handle as referring to either "/some/ 
filesystem/" or "/some/filesystem/ (anonymous temp file)" or something.
