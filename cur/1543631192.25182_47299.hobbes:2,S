I have a process context.  This will be happening from module_init() in a
module I am writing, which, last I checked, uses the process context of
the process that did the system call.

No, I understood what Richard was saying, but he was being kind of rude
and lecturing.  He could have been just factual, sans attitude.
Anyway, if you honestly want to help me, then please enlighten me,
otherwise spare me the lectures.
And the thing that comedi does with /dev/comeiXX is a cheap hack that I
wanted to do away with, which was *why* I was going to try and figure out
the ACTUAL device minor on a vfs character device, in order to fool
comedi_open().
