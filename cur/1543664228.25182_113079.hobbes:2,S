If I'm reading this correctly, this is called out of APIC_init_uniprocessor
from smp_init ... isn't that after people have finished using
phys_cpu_present_map (eg setup_ioapic_ids_from_mpc)? 
maybe change this bit in trap_init:
@@ -665,7 +665,6 @@
 	}
 	set_bit(X86_FEATURE_APIC, boot_cpu_data.x86_capability);
 	mp_lapic_addr = APIC_DEFAULT_PHYS_BASE;
-	boot_cpu_physical_apicid = 0;
 	if (nmi_watchdog != NMI_NONE)
 		nmi_watchdog = NMI_LOCAL_APIC;
 
to do:
boot_cpu_physical_apicid = hard_smp_processor_id();
phys_cpu_present_map = 1 << boot_cpu_physical_apicid;
or something like that? On the other hand, I can't see how this works right
now (maybe it doesn't), so the above may be utterly wrong.
