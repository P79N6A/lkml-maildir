swsusp does not work with swap files. suspend2 does.
so this is an inprovement. improvements are usually merged,
unless there is a reason not to.
could the discussion focus on current technical reasons why it
should not be merged? I somehow get the impression there are
personal preferences or future development strategies, but neither
looks like a current technical reason to me, and thus should not
harm merging or not.
