No, no ISO fs exported.
My /etc/exports:
# cat /etc/exports
/home \
 diablo(rw,no_root_squash) @linux(rw,root_squash) @unix(rw,root_squash) mtgvaio1(ro,root_squash) @cluster01_hosts(rw,root_squash)
/tmp \
 diablo(rw,no_root_squash) @linux(rw,root_squash) @unix(ro,root_squash) mtgvaio1(ro,root_squash) @cluster01_hosts(rw,root_squash)
/usr/local \
 diablo(ro,no_root_squash) @linux(ro,root_squash) @unix(ro,root_squash) mtgvaio1(ro,root_squash) @cluster01_hosts(ro,root_squash)
and
# egrep " /home | /tmp | /usr " /proc/mounts
/dev/vg01/home /home ext3 rw 0 0
/dev/vg01/tmp /tmp ext3 rw 0 0
/dev/vg01/usr /usr ext3 rw 0 0
all exported filesystems are ext3 over LVM.
(I stopped a while ago exporting ISO fs's over nfs, I'm now copying the distro DVD (SuSE) on a HD ... Any "good" solution for exporting ISO fs's over NFS ? the problem is always when you need the
cdrom/dvd drive and want to umount the NFS exported cdrom/dvd, then ...)
What about the first Oops ?
Thanks, Richard

Unix IS user friendly. It's just selective about who its friends are.
