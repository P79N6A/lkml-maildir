Actually, unless I'm mistaken the problem is that "ls" (even when you
ask it not to sort entries) is doing readdir on the whole directory
before returning any results.  We see this with Lustre and very large
directories.  Run strace on "ls" and it is doing masses of readdirs, but
no output to stdout.  Lustre readdir works OK on directories up to 10M
files, but ls sucks.
$ strace ls /usr/lib 2>&1 > /dev/null

Use a different partition format (e.g. EFI or devicemapper) or none at all.
That is better than just ignoring the whole thing and some user thinking
"gee, I have all this free space here, maybe I'll make another partition".
