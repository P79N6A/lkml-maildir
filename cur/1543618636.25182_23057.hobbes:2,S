Measuring the performace of a parallelized kernel compile with warm caches
on a 8 way NUMA-Q box. Highmem support is turned OFF so I'm only using
the first 1Gb or so of RAM (it's much faster without HIGHMEM).
prepare:
make -j16 dep; make -j16 bzImage; make mrproper; make -j16 dep; 
measured:

Seems to give a significant improvement, not only giving a shorter 
elapsed time, but also lower CPU load.
Martin.
