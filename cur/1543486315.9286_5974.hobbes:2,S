Hi
in order to developp a isdn driver, I use the modularized way
But if I want to use the gdbstub kernel debugger, i can t access to the 
module symbols
So I need to know 
-how to link the driver code to the kernel at boot, in order to access 
my driver's functions (edit general Makefile??)
-and how to start the code 
( I suppose there is no init_module and no cleanup..)
Thanks
Fabien
