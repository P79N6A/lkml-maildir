Hello All,
I ran into a spinlock recursion problem while testing the locking
corrctness of a 2.6.24.7-rt26-kernel on a Freescale iMX processor
(ARM). Unfortunately this Freescale architecture code is not in
mainline, but at least the blackfin architecture seems to have the
same setup (looking at bfin_gpio_irq_type() ), so it is not a
Freescale only problem.
What happens is that these routines are called in this order:
-> request_irq()
    -> setup_irq()  --> Lock the spinlock
(spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock, flags)) for the first time
        -> gpio_set_irq_type()  (or bfin_gpio_irq_type() on blackfin
in arch/blackfin/mach-common/ints-priority-sc.c)
            -> set_irq_handler()
               -> __set_irq_handler()   --> Locks the same spinlock a
2nd time, resulting in a BUG/hang, see below
I am looking at this code for a while now, and have not found a proper
solution to solve this problem yet. Does anyone have a great idea?
Kind Regards,
Remy
