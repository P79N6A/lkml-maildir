Good point <grin>.
Horsepower is a measure of power, of energy over time, such as the
rate of providing or using electrical or mechanical energy.
So, with your suggestion of 'horsepower', are you saying that cpu_power
is a metric of such electrical or mechanical energy -- the peak or
average watts of the electricity consumed by the CPUs in a group?
Or is 'cpu_power' a metric of the computational capacity, such as
BogoMIPS provided by the CPUs in a group, such as I had presumed?
Hmmm ... apparently from your latest explanation, it's neither
of these.
Rather it's a metric of how many tasks to place in a group, due to
various capacities and constraints, such as computational power
(BogoMIPS) and electrical power (watts or horsepower).
Should 'cpu_power' be renamed to 'task_load' ?
