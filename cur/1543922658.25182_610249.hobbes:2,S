Yes. There are many duplicated code between efi_32.c and efi_64.c, and
they should be merged. But there are some code that is different between
efi_32.c and efi_64.c. For example, there is different implementations
of efi_call_phys_prelog in both files, and there is an implementation of
efi_memmap_walk only in efi_32.c not in efi_64.c.
3 possible schemes are as follow:
- One efi.c, with EFI 32/64 specific code inside corresponding
#ifdef/#endif.
- 3 files: efi.c, efi_32.c, efi_64.c, common code goes in efi.c, EFI
32/64 specific code goes in efi_32/64.c. This will make some variable,
function external instead of static.
- 3 files: efi.c, efi_32.c, efi_64.c, common code goes in efi.c, EFI
32/64 specific code goes in efi_32/64.c. efi.c include efi_32/64.c
according to architecture.
Which one is preferred? Or I should take another scheme?
Best Regards,
Huang Ying
