Alex,
It comes with its own C-library. It doesn't need to use yours. You
put their c-library where they say it should be, modify environment
variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include theirs, add their library directory
to ld.do.config, execute `ldconfig` and it will work.
FYI, their library should be in /opt/Office40/lib. I have 5.0, so
it's in /opt/Office50/lib. Here is my LD_LIBRARY_PATH (this goes in
/etc/profile).
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib/:/usr/X11R6/lib:/opt/Office50/lib:/usr/java/lib/i686
LESS=-MM
Admittably this was hard to figure out because the documentation is
poor. However, the program itself works very well and allows me to
read/write m$garbage.doc files without having to poison my machine with
Gates-turds.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
