hm, this is _ancient_ code (possibly dating back to the pharaohs). If we 
are in KERNEL_DS then we call do_signal() then we are most likely a 
kernel thread and regs->esp points to the kernel stack ... the result of 
which would be a quite spectacular crash anyway.
Patch below.

Oleg Nesterov pointed out that the set_fs() calls in setup_frame()
and setup_rt_frame() were superfluous.
