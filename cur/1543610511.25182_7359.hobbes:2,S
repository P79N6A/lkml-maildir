It's either a cosmetic problem or a really problematic one, depending
on how closely controlled that particular part of the namespace is.
The .journal file could potentially try to be copied, backed up, you
name it.  Now, since this is now only an issue for the root partition,
this is much less of a problem (the risk for namespace problems in /
are much less.)

You can do that now via initrd as well.
