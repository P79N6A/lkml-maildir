Then make sure noone releases a kernel ;-)

Much better: rsync from /oldfs to /newfs, stop all ftp uploads, rsync
again to catch any new files that have been added until the ftp
upload was closed, then do _one_ (technically two) mountpoint moves
(as opposed to Willy's idea of "some directories") in a mere second
along the lines of
  mount --move /oldfs /older; mount --move /newfs /oldfs.
let old transfers that still use files in /older complete (lsof or
fuser -m), then disconnect the old volume. In case /newfs (now
/oldfs) is a volume you borrowed from someone and need to return it,
well, I guess you need to rsync back somehow.
