	Hi 
	I'm curios what was that change & undo about in test12
and test13pre3ac3 regarding the disabling of PCI IO and MM access while
writing to the config registers in pci_read_bases().
These lines were cut from test 12 and now they are back.      
      /* Disable IO and memory while we fiddle */
       pci_read_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, &cmd);
       tmp = cmd & ~(PCI_COMMAND_IO | PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY);
       pci_write_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, tmp);
	[.....]
       pci_write_config_word(dev, PCI_COMMAND, cmd);
Why were they cut in the first place?
Can anyone enlighten me?
Thanks,
Jani.
