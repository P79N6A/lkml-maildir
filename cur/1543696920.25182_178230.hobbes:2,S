The hardware driver, ide or scsi subsystem, and the VFS all interact to
make the limitations on this.
It'd probably be best to post what kind of disk controllers you have, and
see what your limitations will be for them without the patch.  And even with
the patch, many of the hardware drivers may have lurking bugs for larger
block dev sizes.
