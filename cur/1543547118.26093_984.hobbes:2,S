I have to disagree with Keith here.  It's more reliable to solve the
problem in kernel space.  /proc/config.gz is guaranteed to hold the
configuration of the running kernel (if it exists at all).  But
/lib/modules/<version>/.config might match the running kernel, or it
might not, depending on whether someone has messed with the system.
And people do mess with systems, and then do call support lines.
/lib/modules/<version>/.config is a big step up from the current situation
and I'm grateful.  But I do want /proc/config.gz in the kernel.
