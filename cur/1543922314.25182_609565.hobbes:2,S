Subject: Changing the number of keys supported by the input subsystem

Currently the IR input handling of drivers/media/dvb/ttpci/budget-ci.c 
requires a rc5_device module option which specifies the rc5 device code 
to listen to (or as an alternative, all devices). This means, among 
other things, that multiple remotes can't be used with different 
keymaps.
My idea was to drop the module parameter and allow all rc5 device and 
command combinations to be mapped using one keyboard map.
rc5 device codes are 5 bits, command codes are 6 bits, giving a total of 
2048 possible keycodes.
However, the input subsystem is currently limited to 512 entries. So my 
question is whether it would be possible to extend that and/or make the 
size of the keymap (the keybit member of struct input_dev) dynamic?
