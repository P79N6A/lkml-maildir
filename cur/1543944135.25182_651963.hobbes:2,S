Maybe this should go to a more specific list, but I had
a question about a dmesg v. Kconfig item.
One option under graphics asks about enabling firmware EDID
and says should be safe.  So it's 'yes'
Further down under nVidia FB Support, there is an option
"Enable DDC Support" which tries to use i2c for getting
EDID info and I should say 'Y'.
With those on, in dmesg, I get:
i2c-adapter i2c-0: unable to read EDID block.
i2c-adapter i2c-0: unable to read EDID block.
i2c-adapter i2c-0: unable to read EDID block.
i2c-adapter i2c-1: unable to read EDID block.
i2c-adapter i2c-1: unable to read EDID block.
i2c-adapter i2c-1: unable to read EDID block.
Followed by:

nvidiafb: Using CRT on CRTC 0

    So this means turning "DCC Support" is useless on this machine?
    Also, why can't the graphics drivers use a base that is
not aligned on a 0x20000000 boundary?  Is this a machine design flaw,
or some limitation in the software?
Thanks muchly,
Linda
