es it mean we need to slow down  acpi_ec_intr_read/write ?

Really strange,  how several printks could change the results.
Could you try to repalce acpi_os_stall with acpi_os_sleep(1)
in acpi_ec_intr_read/write?

Also, please change I2RB copy to: 
                    Method (I2RBcopy, 3, NotSerialized)
                    {
                        Store (Arg0, HCSL)
                        Store (ShiftLeft (Arg1, 0x01), HMAD)
                        Store (Arg2, HMCM)
                        Store (0x0B, HMPR)
		Store(CHKS(), local0)
		Store(local0, Debug)
                        Return (local0)
                    }
And boot with acpi_dbg_layer=0x10 acpi_dbg_level=0x10,
Post full log (Don't edit) for both not hang case, and hang case on
bugzilla.
There should have some clues.
Thanks,
Luming
