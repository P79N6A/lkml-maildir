Subject: Kernel Oops on 2.2.14 while mounting...

Running kernel 2.2.14 stock with no patches.  Red Hat 6.2 system.
I've got an HP7200i burner on hdc (sr0), and a reader on
hdd.  The writer is using ide-scsi.o and the reader is using
ide-cd.o.  Both are compiled as modules.
I was blanking a CDRW with cdrecord, and after I started it
blanking a few minutes later I threw a disk in the CDROM (hdd) to
copy some files off it while the disk blanked in the burner.
When I ran mount, to mount the cdrom I put in hdd, it sat there
not responding.  It appeared that cdrecord locked the ide bus or
something.  I've never tried to use my reader while burning or
blanking ever before so I didn't know wether this was normal or
not.
I tried to CTRL-C and CTRL-\ it to no avail.  ps showed the mount
process in the D state.  I tried to kill it with -9 to no avail
as well.
I tried mounting on another tty while the previous mount was
sitting locked and the second mount hung too.  I assumed that the
command would succeed once the CDRW blanking was complete.  I was
wrong.
As soon as the blank completed, I got the following, a double
oops:

I closed all apps, and shutdown the system ok after this.  If
there is other information needed to be able to track down the
problem, please let me know and I'll gladly supply it.
