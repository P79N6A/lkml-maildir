Tested , not broken, working now but the same problem,
that is if I reboot to winXP or 2.6.12, 2.6.11, the
NIC is unusaeble. In XP it always says link is down,
or media disconnected (from ipconfig command output in
XP)
is it because the firmware of NIC has changed or any
reason?
I noticed  warning messages only with 2.6.13 
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #10:2000000@0 for
0000:02:01.0
and modem device in 2.6.13 IRQ is disabled.
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LKMO] enabled at IRQ 20
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:06.1[B] -> Link [LKMO] ->

ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:06.1 disabled
not sure if it gives more information.

Not sure how can I restore this thing back to normal
(sigh)
Thanks
