Hehehe, either a slow system, or you know how to transfer a working
setup to another machine.
My current image I use(d) for all of my machines was Built a long time

Currently on an Athlon XP3200+ with bells and whistles not even thought
of then. Moved through about 12 machines since the beginning.
