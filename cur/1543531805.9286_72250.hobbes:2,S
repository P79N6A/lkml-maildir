Probably. Though I do not think that it is a problem.
At least because it was not a problem until now 8)
Note, that function SO_SNDBUF -> sk->sndbuf is not 1-1 mapping in any case.
F.e. do setsockopt(SO_SNDBUF, 10000000);
Look, what getsockopt(SO_SNDBUF) returns after this.

Why did you decide that this is valid sequence?
wmem_default is not a value to feed to setsockopt().
If it were, it would be called sndbuf_default.
