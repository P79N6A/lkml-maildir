Ops, I am sorry. But in the bug description which Rafael wrote above
there is a link to your original post
References: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/23/263
so I thought this was the bug being dealt with here.

I thought that the bug had vanished, but two days ago it happened
again in my Vaio. There were a couple of different messages comparing
to the picture in the link above, but the last message was exactly the
same.
And I see that Rafael closed the bug 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10117
The hang two days ago was with 2.6.25-rc7-00150-g(can't remember),
do you think the bug was fixed since that kernel?
I will try to test with the latest git, but I don't have internet
access at my house anymore, so I will have to clone the git
repository into my pendrive and take it there...
