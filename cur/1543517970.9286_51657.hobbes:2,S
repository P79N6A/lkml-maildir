And every version benefitted because of this. You want to stamp this out.
You want us to have DOS like cruft ? No thanks

For much increased performance
See with binary interfaces you'd be stuck with something than ran like 1.2
or 2.0 nowdays. That would suck.

Which gives more cross platform portability.

He means almost always. In fact we go to great pains not to break the stable
source interface for drivers and filesystems. 2.2.0 and 2.2.14pre11 are
very very close on this. In fact I routinely get driver submissions for
2.2.5 that build in 2.2.14 unchanged.

It's a free market. They don't have to support Linux, they dont have to
provide source. The customer is always right.  Its also fairly naive to think
that it won't get reverse engineered if its annoying enough.
DVD crypto for example is highly secret and was smashed by a kid from Norway
and his pals. So a kid from Norway beat the DVD forum. You think a serious
vendor can't beat you. I doubt your driver is even hardened self modifying code
designed to beat a debugger.

These definitely exist. However they are unusual. Some people have extremely
clever software trickery involved in making their hardware very cheap. Some
have very clever hardware stuff they don't want to reveal. They are few and
Linux is a real problem to them... Just like NT is a real problem to people
who want to patch the kernel internals.

No. The winmodem people are just vendors so lost in the world of ideas as
property they can't conceive of giving information away. There is an 
approvals complexity in some countries too and other stuff. Its a complex
area.

Customer power will sort this out. Vendors supporting open source will do
well in the Linux market. Those not using open source will either not play
in that market or will play at a disadvantage.
I talk to lots of vendors, from all sorts of camps. Almost none of them
see it as a religious or philosophical issue. They work on the basis
of 'what is the cost from providing info' 'what do we gain in marketing,
in sales and in goodwill'. Do the sums, is it worth it. This is hard accounting
at work. Open source sells hardware to Linux people. Linux people represent
some of the highest spending computing people, they represent many of the
'early adopters' of your toy. The fact that putting the pdf of the chip docs
on the web page gets them to write drivers for you is even better in many
of their eyes.
