I hope this is the right place to post, please forgive me if this is not the case.
Building 2.6.1-mm2 fails on my Athlon64 with:
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/x86_64/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x4bf7): In function `do_IRQ':
: undefined reference to `kgdb_process_breakpoint'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Can anyone help here? Please reply to the_master_of_disaster AT gmx DOT at, as I am no subscriber of this list, thank you!
Thanks in advance,
Robert Führicht
