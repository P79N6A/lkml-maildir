Hi,
Has anyone tried the Promise IDE FastTrak66 Raid controller under Linux?  I'd
only be interesting in using Raid0.
I may be mistaken, but does the device just appear as an IDE device to Linux,
or are additional drivers needed?
Certainly from a price/performance side of things the device looks very
attractive indeed, but only if it works....
Mark
