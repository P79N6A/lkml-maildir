Subject: [PATCH 0/5] KVM: suspend/resume support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following patchset allows a host with running virtual machines to be 
suspended and, on at least a subset of the machines tested, resumed.  
Note that this is orthogonal to suspending and resuming an individual 
guest to a file.
A side effect of implementing suspend/resume is that cpu hotplug is now 
supported.  This should please the owners of big iron.
Andrew, please queue for 2.6.21.
