Hi,
Well, while doing my duty as a good user by using the latest kernel
patches and looking for problems, I ran accross a case where the kernel
would not compile if you selected that you had a PPro/686 and have no SMP
support selected (it works fine if you select SMP support or change the
CPU to a pentium) you get the following message:
[root@firestar linux]# make zImage
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 -malign-loops=2
-malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686  -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h: In function `check_config':
In file included from init/main.c:27:
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h:354: `smp_found_config' undeclared
(first use this function)
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h:354: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/bugs.h:354: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1
It happens in bugs.h just after it sees that CONFIG_GOOD_APIC is defined
and then includes some smp stuff that didn't get declared. It looks like
an easy fix, but since I don't know what a good APIC is I don't know if
the bug is either in that part of the code or wherever CONFIG_GOOD_APIC
gets defined I decided not to fix it myself.
Hope this helps. :)  
Later,
  Ryan
