Ping rate is unlimited for any kernel version.
At least, I see 15kpps with zero packet loss and rtt below 100usecs.
Taking into account that "ping -f" does not buffer output,
it is close to perfect. It is the first.
And the second: Dick, you were said already dozen of times:
1. your ping is buggy. Upgrade.
2. nothing occured in 2.1, it was behaviour of Linux since 1.0 or so.
Please, stop to confuse people.
