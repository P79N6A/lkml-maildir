we have a weird bug where the open of the shell output redirection
happens before the mkdir command returns.
As a result, the redirection will fail. Unexpected data loss.
This bug was seen on ppc64 (dual ppc970) and also on i386, single cpu
3GHz xeon with smp kernel. Running kernel was our SLES9 2.6.5. It did
also happen on ppc64 with 2.6.9-rc2-mm4, but I havent verified that.
It was not seen with just one script running, but with 2 (or more).
The inner loop fails after 2-3 hours, sometimes earlier, sometimes
never. Some tracing shows:
sys32_open(2076) fs-stress-olh.s(2736):c1,j3193150 S /dev/zero
sys32_open(2076) fs-stress-olh.s(2736):c1,j3193154 S 01/11/59/8/data
sys32_open(2076) fs-stress-olh.s(2736):c1,j3193157 S ./01/11/59/9/DIRNAME
sys_mkdir(1696) fs-stress-olh.s(2736):c1,j3193162 E 01/11/59/9
That means, a gap of up 5 jiffies betwen the start of the open
syscall and the end of the mkdir syscall.
In this case, everything happend on cpu1.
The dd command does never fail.
If I add more printk (start/end of sys_open, sys_mkdir), the bug will
disappear.
A quick look at the bash2 sources shows a wait(-1,..), I believe the
bash does nothing unusual.
Any ideas whats going on here, and how to debug it further?
