Sorry, are you suggesting to use page accounting for slab objects?
You mean, that if we can account page fractions then we can charge
part of slab page to object owners?
If this is correct, then I think it is ineffecient.
In our current implementation page beancounters can charge
only equal fraction of page to each owner, so it is not suitable for slabs.
Moreoever, it is easier to do correct accounting from the slab allocator
itself and with much less overhead.

In order to decide which of the containers is crazy you need
to account correctly the amount of _pinned_ dcache memory.
And even to select correct container for OOM you need to have a corect accounting
of _pinned_ dcache.

We have the following scheme:
cache which should be charged are marked as SLAB_UBC. the same for particular allocations,
we have a GFP_UBC flag specifing that the allocation should be charged to
the owner. Does it look good for you?
I will post kernel memory accounting patches soon here.
Thanks,
Kirill
