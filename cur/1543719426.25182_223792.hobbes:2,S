[1.] ACPI and USB failures in 2.6.7-rc1 
[2.] CPU frequency table is not provided by DMESG at all.
Soft-rebooting results in failure to reinitialise USB peripherals.
Soft-rebooting causes Windows XP to hang during startup.
[3.] kernel, ACPI, CPUFREQ, USB
[4.] kernel-2.6.7-rc1
Returning to kernel-2.6.6 solved all three observed issues.
Toshiba Tecra S1
Pentium-M (Banias, 1400 MHz) 
Intel i855PM / ICH4M
Mobility Radeon 9000
Sorry to be so brief. I appreciate this isn't everything you would like to know. Will submit a
more detailed report when I have sufficient time to do so.
