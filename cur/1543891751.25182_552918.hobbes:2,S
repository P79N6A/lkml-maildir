Seeing the lack of the '+' I think it's a mangling from not paying attention 
to the 80 column marker in the editor.

They are. 
Here's two hints:
1) double check for hidden "word wrap" problems. A sane programmers editor 
will alert you to this, and careful checking of the patches before posting 
will also reveal them. (emacs shows a \ in the 80th column, jed puts a $ 
there, etc...)
2) when there is a potential for syslog spam - like your patch has - use 
printk_ratelimit() instead of printk(). This will throttle the output so that 
flooding the syslog is no longer possible.
DRH
ps: you patch is very difficult to apply - try using git
