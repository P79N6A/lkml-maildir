Right. I encountered something like this not too long ago in some
other gcc code that would not compile on a Sun.
	FYI, just because gcc lets you get away with some things (it
	knows what you want and tries to be helpful), that doesn't
	mean that the 'C' standard allows it.
	Here is a cute example:
	void foo()
        {
            extern int a;
            if(a) goto foo;
            return;
            foo:
	    printf("%d\n", a);
        }
	gcc allows you to use a label that has the same name as
	the function!
	It also allows you to use the name of a variable as a label!
	void foo()
	{
	   extern int a;
	   if(a) goto a;
	   return;
	   a:
	   printf("%d\n", a);
	}
	Both examples allow an extern declaration inside a function scope
	which is also contrary to any (even old) 'C' standards. 'extern'
	is always file scope, there's no way to make it otherwise.
