Hi!
In 2.6.0-test1, OHCI is non-functional after first suspend/resume, and
kills machine during secon suspend/resume cycle.
What happens is that ohci_irq gets ohci->hcca == NULL, and kills
machine. Why is ohci->hcca == NULL? ohci_stop was called from
hcd_panic() and freed ohci->hcca.
I believe that we should
1) not free ohci->hcca so that system has better chance surviving
hcd_panic()
and 
2) inform user when hcd panics.
This patch does both, please apply,
[Okay, you probably want to kill the ifdefs, and kill the code,
leaving just a comment...]
