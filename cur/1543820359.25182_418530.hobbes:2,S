It's too small of a fragment to tell whether or not appropriate
exception handling has been set up, but yeah, it needs a try/catch to
be safe.  That's *1* of the bugs in the c example.  It's the one they
share.
It's not the only one in the C code, though, as Willy Tarreau pointed
out, the malloc idiom is wrong, since it doesn't allocate space for
the terminating null.
Of course, the C fragment has the implicit problem of who will do the
associated free to avoid the memory leak, where the C++ fragment has
the issue of garbage collection...
