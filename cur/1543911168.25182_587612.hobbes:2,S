Actually, it's a different problem, but with a similar cause.
mmiowb() is for the case PIO (or MMIO) write order from two different CPUs
can invert somewhere in the NL fabric.
read_relaxed() is a performance optimization to avoid the flush that's
necessary to avoid inversion in order between a PIO (or MMIO) read and
a DMA write.
What Arthur's trying to do here is avoid inversion in the order of two
DMA writes.
