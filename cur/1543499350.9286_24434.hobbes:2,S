Hello,
Can anyone tell me if it is possible to manipulate a disk image with
multiple partitions? I wanted to make a file that looks like 
"hda: hda1 hda2" for booting Linux (or some other OS) under bochs and I
don't know of an easy way of doing it. I.e. the only way I can think of is
to make the partitions as separate files and also a separate boot sector
with partition table in it and then merge it all together.
Wouldn't it be nice to use the other minor entries of a loop device
(loop1-loop7) for this kind of partitioning scheme?
(I know that I could workaround this particular problem by using /dev/hda
instead of /dev/hda1 and have swap elsewhere but I am curious if it is in
principle possible to manipulate disk images with more than 0 partitions
on them)
Regards,
Tigran.
