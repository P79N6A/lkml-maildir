O.k. On the LinuxBIOS front it will take a little more work but we should
be able to have the LinuxBIOS table report the presence of the devices
that need to be configured, and possibly some motherboard specific configuration
for those devices (Think of irq routing).   All of which should reduce
strange motherboard configuration to the general device driver problem.

I have just posted a patch that does the heavy lifting needed to make
using a 32bit entry point possible.  It allows skipping of the 16bit
bios calls.  With that patch in place it becomes trivial to query
the data from LinuxBIOS instead of the PCBIOS.
