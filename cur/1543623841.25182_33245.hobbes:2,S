First, the IDE driver doesn't check the controller's class code is raid
controller (0x0104) or other controller(0x0180). So If our raid controller
(FastTrak series) be seen by IDE driver. It will snatch the same IRQ.
It will cause our trouble.
It's pity that the linux kernel could agree this point also.
