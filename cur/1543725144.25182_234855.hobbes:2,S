I think the code has no opinion. It was 128 in 2.4.
I am not aware of assumptions on NR_KEYS.
So, do not think this is an off-by-one error.
Vojtech did this intentionally.
However, I have no objections. In fact loadkeys uses 256.

The binaries will still work. If the utility is recompiled, against
recent kernel headers, then the person doing that is responsible
for the result.
I just checked kbd, but there are no such char variables there.
Do you have specific utilities in mind? Is X OK?
