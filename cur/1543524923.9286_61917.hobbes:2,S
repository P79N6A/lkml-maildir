Hi,

I would suggest to change init_bootmem(), too, AFAIK the default of zero
is only for i386 helpful, all other have to fiddle with the mem node
interface and IMO we shouldn't begin to mix them if it's not really
necessary. I don't know if it's too late for this, but maybe we should
rename the *_core() functions into *_node() functions and make the other
ones small special inline functions that call the generic versions. That
would remove the bulk of (IMO unnecessary) small functions at the end of
bootmem.c
BTW did someone try the patch below? This make a mm mapping possible,
where several physical memory chunks are mapped together in one single 
virtual mapping (like we do it currently on m68k). If it doesn't break
anything, it could be integrated?
bye, Roman
