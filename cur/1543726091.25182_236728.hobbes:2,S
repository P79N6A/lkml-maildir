Here is a belated patch that updates UML to 2.6.7.  The update was the only 
change from the 2.6.6 UML.
The next step will be the mm tree.  I'll get that UML fixed up, and start
splitting it into reasonable patches that Andrew is happy to feed to Linus.
The 2.6.7-1 UML patch is available at
	
http://www.user-mode-linux.org/mirror/uml-patch-2.6.7-1.bz2
My BK tree is temporarily out of commission until I get my process feeding
patches from quilt into it.
