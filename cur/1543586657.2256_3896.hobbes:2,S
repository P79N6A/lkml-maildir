The box has two NIC's (a via rhine at IRQ 10 and the RTL8139). The
strange things is that the RTL8139 card is detected at IRQ 11 but runs
at IRQ 12 (11 is used by an ATI AGP card):
  Bus  0, device   9, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT86C100A [Rhine 10/100]
(rev 6).
      IRQ 10.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=118.Max Lat=152.
      I/O at 0xe800 [0xe87f].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe8000000 [0xe800007f].
  Bus  0, device  10, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139 (rev
16).
      IRQ 12.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=32.Max Lat=64.
      I/O at 0xec00 [0xecff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe8001000 [0xe80010ff].
  Bus  1, device   0, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc 3D Rage IIC AGP (rev
58).
      IRQ 11.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=8.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe6000000 [0xe6ffffff].
      I/O at 0xd000 [0xd0ff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe5000000 [0xe5000fff].
