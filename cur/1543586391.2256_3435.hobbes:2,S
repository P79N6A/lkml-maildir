My IDE and AIC7xxx drivers are compiled in to the kernel. I normally conpile
system dependent drivers into the kernel and leave the rest modules when
possible.

In all prior versions of the kernel 2.4.3 I have never had this problem. I
have both 2.4.2 & 2.4.3 and when booting from one to the other 2.4.2 orders
my SCSI id's correctly and 2.4.3 doesn't.
It really wouldn't make a big deal but I consider my cdroms and zip drives
to be removable devices and if I ever decided to remove my zip my scsi ids
will change. Removing a harddrive is not the same as removing a zip!
Are there other people with the same problem?
