A few minutes after a reboot, the following error messages appear on our system
    hda: ATAPI 8X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache
    Uniform CDROM driver Revision: 2.55
    cdrom: open failed.
followed by a repeating VFS error messages below.
    VFS: Disk change detected on device ide0(3,0)
    VFS: Disk change detected on device fd(2,0)
    end_request: I/O error, dev 02:00 (floppy), sector 0
    cdrom: open failed.
It all started when we upgraded to linux 2.2.x series and this time 2.2.11 has
been released but still we have this problem.  We don't do anything on our
CD-ROM and floppy drive but the messages just keep on appearing from time to
time.
The system is a Compaq Proliant 800 with 1 Pentium 200 processor, 128MB RAM,
1 4GB SCSI drive,  1 IDE CD-ROM drive and a floppy drive.  The system is using 
Redhat 6.0 distribution.
I also noticed that it's only on Pentium Pro servers  that the error message
did appear.  On our Pentium 130 system, no such error occur.
Anybody out there have any idea how to get away with such problem?
Below is the dmesg output.
