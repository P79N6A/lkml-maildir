Thank you for taking the time to respond. I showed the error logs for this 
card and driver as an example; however I see the same problem (simultaneous 
disconnects) using a 3Com 589D Ethernet card, an Adaptec 1480A SCSI adapter 
and even a PCMCIA modem (Gateway). All work fine until I move a USB mouse 
while a lot of data flows through the PCMCIA card (small transfers do not 
automatically hang the two). I don't have other USB devices with me at the 
moment to try, but I believe I have seen the effect in the past with others.
I'd be happy to attach more logs if someone wants to poke, and also to try 
suggestions for different settings etc. Thanks again,
                                                               Vassili
