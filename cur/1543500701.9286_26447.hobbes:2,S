Subject: Question on asm constraints

The gcc info page for Extended Asm says
  "Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe
  this, write a third colon after the input operands, followed by the
  names of the clobbered hard registers (given as strings)"
and
  "If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler
  code, you will probably have to list the register after the third
  colon to tell the compiler the register's value is modified".
Some kernel asm-i386 constructs do this, others do not, they are not
very consistent.  For example, both strtok and strstr explicitly hit
%eax but only strtok declares it in the third constraint.  strstr
constrains its result to "a" but is that enough?  strrchr has an "a"
constraint and it explicitly lists "ax" as well.  Why the differences?
Is "ax" optional as a third constraint when input or output is "a" or
should we always specify a third constraint of "ax", just to be on the
safe side?
