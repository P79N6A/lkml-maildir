I think the call path via dev->hard_start_xmit, if it fails, may result
in an skb not being freed.  This appears to be the case with the e100.c
driver.  The qdisc_restart path to dev->hard_start_xmit also appears
susceptible to this.  It appears that not all devices agree as to who
should clean-up an skb on error.
