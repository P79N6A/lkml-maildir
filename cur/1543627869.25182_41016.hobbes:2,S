This ie a problem with the VIA chipsets.  Intel chipsets burst 4096
bytes per burst, while the VIA chipsets were sending doing 64 bytes per burst.
AMD (like the origional poster later mentioned) chipsets weren't mentioned
in the comparison article I read, so I don't know if it has the same
trouble.
