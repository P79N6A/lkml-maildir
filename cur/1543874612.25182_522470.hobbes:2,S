Hi Eric,
	I think one has to look harder, then.  There is no "equivalent in
setup.S": there is no setup.S, and it's certainly not clear what GDT
this "must mirror": it doesn't mirror any GDT at the moment.
	This leaves us with "is only used for booting".  The name
"boot_gdt_table" and the code itself are pretty clear.
	A comment might well deserve to live here, but not this one 8)
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
