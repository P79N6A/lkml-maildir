Next time I promise to finish the report before hitting send.
I'm using a Gentoo Linux system with the vanilla 2.4.28 sources installed. The
attached config file is what I'm using.
appletalk.o now has a dependency it didn't have in 2.4.26, which are the modules
psnap.o and p8022.o, which I can't find how to disable.
If I start netatalk, it modprobes appletalk.o, which loads psnap.o and p8022.o. If
I then stop appletalk, it removes appletalk.o (which works) and then psnap.o and
p8022.o (which kernel panics).
I can also get the kernel panic by modprobing p8022.o and then rmmodding it.
The kernel panic is as follows:

~ <0>Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt hander!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
This is a problem because we can't shutdown the machine without this occurring. It
seems that if we disable ipchains in the kernel, it goes away. It also occurs with
the 2.4.27 kernel.
A change we see is in the linux-2.4.28/net/Makefile
mod-subdirs :=  ipv4/netfilter ipv6/netfilter ipx irda bluetooth atm netlink sched
core sctp 802
whereas 2.4.26 has:
mod-subdirs :=  ipv4/netfilter ipv6/netfilter ipx irda bluetooth atm netlink sched
core sctp
This also happens on a number of other machines; mainly RedHat 7.3 machines with
this kernel.
I'm trying to get a ksymoops now, if I get it to work, I'll reply to this post.
You can see an image of the kernel panic (if such things excite you) at:

Note that there is a short delay between removing the module and the panic. You
can also get the panic by removing appletalk, (which works) and then removing
psnap and waiting a few seconds.
Thank you!
