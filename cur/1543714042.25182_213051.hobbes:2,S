It is, of course, preferred to fix the tmscsim driver to work for you too.
If you describe your problem precisely, we could try solving it. There was
a discussion around 2.6.0 on the linux-scsi mailing list whether or not to
keep the AM53C974 driver, and it was decided not to, since the tmscsim
should completely replace it. However, I did write a simple patch that
allowed to compile and use AM53C974 under 2.6. I sent it to LKML on
30.10.03 with the subject "[PATCH] Re: AMD 53c974 SCSI driver in 2.6".
However, again, it would be preferred to improve tmscsim.
You might want to move this discussion to linux-scsi
(linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org).
