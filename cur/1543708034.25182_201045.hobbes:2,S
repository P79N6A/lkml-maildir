Subject: matroxfb not working after trying to upgrade to 2.6.3

Hello list,
I've got a problem with matroxfb not working in either 2.4.23 or 2.6.3 after
trying to upgrade to 2.6 series. My videocard is a G400 and it's built as a
module. Previously, when I modprobed the module, it would register itself in
/etc/log/syslog, but now nothing is printed in the syslog when inserting the
modules. And I don't understand, what has changed. These are the parameters I
give to lilo on boot:
Feb 23 14:06:27 linux kernel: Kernel command line: auto BOOT_IMAGE=Linux ro
root=303 video=matrox:vesa:0x115
And this is my .config:
CONFIG_FB_MATROX=m
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G450=y
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G100=y
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_I2C=m
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_MAVEN=m
and lsmod:
matroxfb_crtc2          8308   0  (unused)
matroxfb_maven         13308   0  (unused)
i2c-matroxfb            2772   0  (unused)
matroxfb_base          20580  63  [matroxfb_crtc2 i2c-matroxfb]
matroxfb_g450           4708   0  [matroxfb_base]
matroxfb_DAC1064        9500   0  [matroxfb_crtc2 matroxfb_base]
g450_pll                3536   0  [matroxfb_g450 matroxfb_DAC1064]
matroxfb_accel          9448   0  [matroxfb_base matroxfb_DAC1064]
matroxfb_misc          15364   0  [matroxfb_crtc2 matroxfb_maven i2c-matroxfb
matroxfb_base matroxfb_g450 matroxfb_DAC1064 g450_pll matroxfb_accel]
but when I try to use matroxset, with both 2.4 and 2.6, I get:
bash:# matroxset -f /dev/fb0 -m 2
ioctl failed: Device or resource busy
I'd be very grateful for any help,  juhis
