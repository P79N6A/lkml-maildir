Absolutely wonderful.  I'd love to see this easily scriptable
so we can just run it with one command, eg:
$ ./contest

Very interesting results. People benchmarking just one thing
at a time won't get variances anywhere near this big, while
real system workload is pretty much always multitasking.
I think I've finally found a benchmark that gives results which
are meaningful in the context of a multitasking system.
