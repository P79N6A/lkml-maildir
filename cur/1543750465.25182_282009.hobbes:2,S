I'm using the /dev/mouse device for X with protocol 'auto'.
Here's the relevant portion of my XF86Config:
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse0"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Protocol" "auto"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/mouse"
EndSection
Unfortunately, I'm not currently physically at the machine (I only
have ssh access currently), so I can't try this stuff right away.
However, I will try your suggestions when I'm next at the machine
later today.
(Also, I'm now realizing that my subject for this thread was wrong, so
I've edited it a bit.)
