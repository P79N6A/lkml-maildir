Willy,
These are all good comments. Regarding the cache penalty, I've done some
measurements using benchmarks like SPEC OMP on an 8-processor SMP and
the performance with this patch was nearly identical to that with the
mainline. I'm sure some apps may suffer from the potentially more
migrations with this design. In the end, I think what we want is to
balance fairness and performance. This design currently emphasizes on
fairness, but it could be changed to relax fairness when performance
does become an issue (which could even be a user-tunable knob depending
on which aspect the user cares more).
Thanks,
  tong
