No, I'm saying there is more to the change lifecycle than the
checkout at the beginning and the commit at the end.  Much more.

Software is more than the mere aggregation of the source files.
What about: the software is supposed to *do* something.  What about
input validation?  (Does it build, does it test OK kinda stuff.)
What about peer review?

NO ONE works directly with their system.  Who in their right mind
edits the *,v or s.* files directly?  We all work through the agency
of a change lifecycle of some sort.  Aegis just makes it visable.

Aegis is *only* policy.  It's doesn't have any built-in history
tool, it delegates that minor (absolutely essential but minor)
portion of the lifecycle to the tool of your choice.  It doesn't
have a built-in merge tool, build tool or test tool, either.
I think you'll find BK is a subset, not a superset.

Everyone is *always* free to roll their own.  But, because they are
not SCM experts, they will more than likely come up with an inferior
solution.  (To a very OLD problem I might add.  Why do we insist
on re-inventing this particular wheel?)  Aegis provides a well-thought-out
flexible shown-to-work set of policies.  Not the only policies,
but good ones.
> sticking your methodology in my face.  
Aegis can do nothing else, that's all it is.
And this is the whole point: the problems which beset distributed
development are *policy* problems, not file version problems.
Un-buildable commits are not a version problem, they are a policy
problem:  How else do you change "you really should not commit
unbuilable changes pretty please" into "you CAN NOT commit unbuildable
changes"  (I deliberately don't say "may not" here.)
Un-peer-reviewed commits are not a version problem, they are a
policy problem:  How else do you change "you really should not
commit unreviewed changes pretty please" into "you CAN NOT commit
unreviewed changes"
Un-tested commits are not a version problem, they are a
policy problem:  How else do you change "you really should not
commit untested changes pretty please" into "you CAN NOT commit
untested changes"

Linux got this far using informal policy ("please" plus human
oversight) which doesn't scale, if I understand the reasons stated
for being dissatisfied with CVS.  Why consider changing to
*anything*, let alone to Aegis or BK, if things are hunky dory?
Aegis DOES NOT do anything to the process which is *informally*
already there, it just makes it formal.  And it automates a fair
whack of the turn-the-handle human oversight.

OK, so use the BK algorithm (maybe raw SCCS if it's been there all
the time) to fold them down.  Configure Aegis with the right
commands, and this will happen.  Aegis does not have an in-built
history tool.  Your history store is as optimal as the history tool
you choose; I'm not forcing the use of any particular history tool
or algorithm.

Sure, so don't park it in the history files.  That's what Aegis'
database is for.  (By being able to cope with just about *any*
history tool, Aegis makes few assumptions about what meta-data they
are capable of minding.)
Again, it's a case of letting the history tool do what it's designed
to do, and Aegis being designed to do the other bits.
> ... It's also completely unreasonable.
I think we have exposed an assumption here, Larry.  Back up a
second: ask youself if it can't work ever, or it can't within the
BK architecture.  I think Aegis works pretty well, and so do my
users.  By doing the impossible?  No.

Same as always.  Fix the bug and get out the backups.
What other possible choices are there?

So all apps everywhere should be coded to check something that the
operating system is supposed to do already?  And just what do they
do when they find a corruption?  Get out the backups.
> Bully for you but hell would freeze over before I'd let you near my source.
The fact is that the vast majority of source code, for decades now,
is stored on those very same flakey disks, with *no* application
verification of disk drive integrity.  And yet, somehow, we continue
to churn out software.
Aegis is designed to do *one* thing, and do it as well as it can.
Problems outside its domain (file system, build tool, history tool,
etc) it delegates.  You want a history tool with a checksum?  Go
ahead.  Um, what about your compiler?

Depends how you send it, tho it always sends the meta data, too.
It could be email, using gzip -9 | mpack, it could be ftp without
the mpack.  It depends.
It also depends on the granularity you chose.  Are you sending a
single change set, a whole branch (LOD), or a whole project?  They are
all sent using the same mechanism.  Of course, each is progressively
larger.

Zero.

Under what circumstances?  If they are both up-to-date, there would
be no reason to do anything.  However, if a change set were
propagated, you have to decide.  If it is a simple change set, the
files by definition are different (or maybe not, but it's a small
effort to decde).  If it is a whole branch, then the files are
checked for equality, at the receiving end, and the change set
pared down to just the differences.  Ditto for a whole project (a
project is simply an un-numbered super-ancestor branch) but obviously
the amount of work is larger.

AFTER the trojan has been commited and acted, which is how I worked
out I need to yank it.  Locking the barn door after the horse has
bolted.  ``Jeeze.''

Nothing, except security (you know: "availability, integrity, confidentiality").
Nothing, except the common case is "peer review failed".
(If your reviews *don't* fail, why the heck are you doing them?)
(You are doing peer reviews, aren't you?)
Also, one of the stated problems with the current state of L-K affairs
is an increasing proportion of, shall we say, "inferior" incoming
patches.  Weeding them out is the issue - policy again - not file revs.
Actually, Aegis distributed development makes *less* work.  It is
perfectly possible, and indeed the recommended practice, to write
a procmail filter which will AUTOMATICALLY perform all of these
validations, and leave it ready for a human to give it the once-over.
Once that's done, the rest of the commit can also be AUTOMATED.
Using Aegis, the essential work of the maintainer, to quote
Linus, is to say "No".  All the messy bits (build it, test it, push
the files around) are automated.
<asside>
Before y'all scream about testing kernels, let me just say that
(a) the kernel presents a challenge, (b) I don't have a foolfproof
ways to do this, (c) I *do* use Aegis to develop and test kernel
modules, and (d) yes, there will always be the halting problem.
When I say "testing" and "Aegis" in the same sentence, I'm speaking
generally.  Mind you, I suspect that as more and more of the kernel
is modules, a heck of a lot of testing is possible!
</asside>
> and when you are going to integrate bug tracking in,
I'm not.  The notification hooks are already there.  (Change sets
have always had meta-data, such as descriptions and audit trails,
since the very beginning.  For many small projects, this may be
enough, but it's a side-effect, not a design goal.  Use the state
transition notifications if you want more.)  Aegis does a particular
portion of the process, not all of it.

Are you suggesting I add a *web server* to it?!?
