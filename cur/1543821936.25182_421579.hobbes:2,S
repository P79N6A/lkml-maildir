My email last night on the subject was more accurate than this - ETOOEARLY.
Have a patch instead.

#	[DRVMODEL] Fix platform_device_add to use device_add
#	
#	platform_device_add() should be using device_add() rather
#	than device_register() - any platform device passed to
#	platform_device_add() should have already been initialised,
#	either by platform_device_alloc() or platform_device_register().
