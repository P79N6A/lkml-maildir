What about those who have incomplete null modem cables which might
not connect DCD or DSR, but who want to use hardware flow control?

Not convinced about this claim - see above.

If you're talking about the terminal server sending to the Linux console,
that's got absolutely nothing to do with the 'r' option.  The 'r' option
only controls the settings for the kernel-side of the console, which is
strictly output only.  The input side is handled just like any tty, and
the termios settings define how that behaves.
Hence, if you enable CRTSCTS without 'r' then you will have flow control
for the userspace side, and no flow control for the kernel messages.
Thinking about this more, all your issues can be cleared up quite
trivially IMHO.  Consider 'r' to mean "I want my kernel console to
try to not drop any kernel messages" and the CRTSCTS termios flag
to mean "I want flow control for non-kernel input/output".  Hence,
if you don't want the modem to be able to effectively halt the kernel,
but you do want reliable communications for getty/shell etc, don't
specify 'r' but ensure that CRTSCTS gets set.

This one I agree with.  The well known sequence is CRLF not LFCR.
