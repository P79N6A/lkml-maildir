More exposition regarding top vs bottom posting: Replying at the bottom
results in an easily parseable tree. Consider the following conversation
where everyone replies at the bottom.

Yeah I looked at that thing and ran away screaming.  Good luck.

Now, look at the same conversation where Able replies at the top.

The result is a tangled mess.  Untangling that mess wastes time.
Replying at the top wastes people's time trying to understand the
conversation.
For a theoretical discussion of why mixing top and bottom agglutination
is wrong, Steven Pinker's "The Language Instinct" has a chapter on how
differing languages build up trees.  Some add from the left, some from
the right, but arbitrarily mixing the two in the same sentence either
results in an ambiguity or what he calls "fruit salad".
Please reply at the bottom.
