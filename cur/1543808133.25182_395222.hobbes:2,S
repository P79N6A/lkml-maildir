I agree and this is why I don't like VPIDS I don't see a way for them
to be anything but pure S&M.

Ouch.  I know there are cases that the above test fails for.  Which
is why I prefer an interface that takes a global reference and gives
you a compile error if you don't.  You are much more likely to catch
all of the users that way.

In capability.c it does for_each_thread or something like that.  It is
very similar to cap_set_pg.  But in a virtual context all != all :)
The current OpenVZ patch appears to at least catch cap_set_all.

I think for people doing migration a private pid space in some form is
necessary, I agree it is generally overkill for the VPS case but if it
is efficient it should be usable.  And certainly having facilities
like this be optional seems very important.
My problem with the vpid case and it's translate at the kernel
boundary is that boundary is huge, and there is no compile time
checking to help you find the problem users.  So I don't think vpids
make a solution that can be maintained, and thus merging them looks
like a very bad idea.
