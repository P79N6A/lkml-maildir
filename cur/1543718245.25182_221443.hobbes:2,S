Hi.
For a long time I'm sorta have the following problem.
I have ext3 partition with dir_index turned on. I have programs, which
store many files on it (for example, Maildir mailboxes for 500+ users,
about 200k files).
Sometimes something going wrong. I am noticing it by rdiff-backup on
this partition producing the following output:
ListError goloub/Maildir/cur/1082623479.1763_0.ns:2,S [Errno 5]
Input/output error:
+'/mnt/mail/goloub/Maildir/cur/1082623479.1763_0.ns:2,S'
Yes, when I am doing strace ls -al (failed file), I am seeing -EIO
lstat64("/mnt/mail/goloub/Maildir/cur/1082623479.1763_0.ns:2,S",
0x806408c) = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
I know, so when I will e2fsck it it will be repaired. But how I can
help debug it?
Which on-disk structs I need to examine, maybe extract, and send to
someone?
