Hello,
If a system call is having following code.
add current process into wait quque ;
while (1)
{  set task state INTERRUPTIBLE ;
    if (a > 0)
      break ;
    schedule() ;
}
set task state RUNNING ;
remove current from wait queue ;
If an interrupt service is having following code
set a = 512 ;
'a' is a global variable shared in ISR and system call
Do I need to define a as 'volatile int a ;' ? Why?
Thanks & Regards,
Dinesh
