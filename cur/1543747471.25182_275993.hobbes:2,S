I agree this document repository has significant potential, but I also 
agree with Dave:  from my own direct experience, documents DO disappear.
The ALSA project routinely asks vendors if the hardware manual can be 
mirrored on their FTP site, and I have been doing the same for network 
and ATA drivers:
	
http://gkernel.sourceforge.net/specs/
Though I cannot say that all the people who gave me permission to mirror 
the site are still around, to give permission to push these specs to ODSL.
