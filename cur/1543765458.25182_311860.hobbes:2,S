That GPL isn't the best license in this case (firmware included as
hexstring in the driver source), we already know. But fixing it is up
to the copyright holder. We or GPL face no risk.
Note that the holder does. I'd be interesting if someone produced a
derivative work, such a translation. A translation from the hex form
to some kind of textual formally defined language, such as, say,
assembler, or C. That would be covered by GPL. And would be
distributable under it. Say that the resulting binary is slightly
different. You are _required_ by GPL to provide the source in the
preferred form, this time, preferred by _you_. What if that is C?
Interesting enough. Can the hexstring be reverse-engineered into C,
if it's placed under GPL? Can the copyright holder really prevent that?
Something new to think of. :-)
Have a nice day,
.TM.
