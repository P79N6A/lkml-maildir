Extended attributes differ from files in N ways (forgive me for not 
specifying N exactly, it would distract us).
What I am saying is that each of the N permutations required to 
transform a file into an extended attribute should be separately 
selectable.  Theory guys would call this orthogonalizing the primitives. 
 (I am a theory guy.;-) ).
It is very important to decompose one's primitives into separately 
specifiable primitives.  It makes for a much more expressive abstract 
model.  This is a very standard policy among mathematicians, that they 
strive to decompose primitives into a more orthogonal toolkit because 
they know from hundreds of years of experience that it inevitably leads 
to more expressive power.  Let us learn from these mathematicians who 
are so much older and wiser than we.
