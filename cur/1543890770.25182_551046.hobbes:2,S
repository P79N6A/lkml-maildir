Hmm ..so do you think this weight decomposition can be used to flatten
the tree all the way to a single level in case of cfs? That would mean we can 
achieve group fairness with single level scheduling in cfs ..I am
somewhat skeptical that we can achieve group fairness with a single
level rb-tree (and w/o substantial changes to pick_next_task logic in cfs
that is), but if it can be accomplished would definitely be a great win.
