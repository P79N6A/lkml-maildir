Are you sure it's a Linux problem? or is your modem subsceptible to the
"old school DoS" described in the thread starting
http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1998_3/0916.html
(ie. send the string +++ATZ to your modem and watch it hang up. send +++
on it's own and it will do as you described above - won't hang up yet
because it's in command mode)

How about tcpdump -i ppp0 ?
