In this latter approach is there any way for the user space program to
catch the termios ioctls (eg to set baud rate etc) that the
application does on the tty end of the pty/tty pair?
(I believe the answer is no!  I got half way through writing a pty/tty
replacement driver which passed the relevant ioctls (decoded into
platform independent "change baud rate to 9600" etc) on the tty
in-band to the pty.  I used in-band so this data stream could then be
piped via ssh etc)
