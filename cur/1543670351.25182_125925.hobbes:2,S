This is the core issue.  Personally, I'd rather stick to simple strings
and per-module attributes rooted at a common point.  This is simplest
for userspace tools.  But the attribute namespace is effectively flat,
so it's a question of simplicity for locating the attributes.  A simple
getxattr(2) vs. a listxattr(2) plus multiple getxattr(2).  Unfortunately,
this points at a single standard name I think...
