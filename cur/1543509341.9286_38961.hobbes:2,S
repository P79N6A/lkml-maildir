A restriction on file formats should not be a major hardship for getting 
patches out.  Submit it in a suitable format.  It is clear that bz2 may not be
a suitable format, as there are some who do not support bz2.  Come on, you've
got tar/gz...
That said, it may be appropriate to document this.

This is a misrepresentation of Linus' comments on this subject.  Linus was 
commenting on the difficulties of incorporating infrequent, large snapshots.
Infrequent, large snapshots ARE inappropriate here, whereas small, frequent 
incremental diffs are appropriate - they ease peer review, and they introduce
much less risk.  Linus also acknowledged that large snapshots may be 
appropriate for things (such as the ISDN functionality) being added to standard
kernels for the first time.

Hey, go figure, Linus takes a couple weeks off.  Core functionality and new 
features need to go through him, and seeing as there's a feature freeze now, 
need to be very well justified.

A big delay is concerning.  However, the reason Linus went off on the ISDN 
group in your second link was to improve stability and solidity.  Infrequent 
large patches do not do anything positive for stability.

Where were the patches posted?  When were the patches posted?  How were the 
patches posted?
