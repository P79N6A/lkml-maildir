So, you used to have a 40 GB disk, all was fine, something happened,
and now you have a 33 GB disk.
There is nothing wrong with the Linux kernel here. You report
66055248 sectors from hdparm, that is, the disk itself claims
size 33.8 GB. Moreover, read access past 33 GB now gets I/O error.
This can be the effect of a jumper.
This can also be the effect of the Maxtor utility JUMPON.EXE.
This might also be the effect of the SETMAX command.
Did you run MaxBlast or JUMPON.EXE or similar disk mangling stuff?
