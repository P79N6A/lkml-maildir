Hi.
The subject says it all: after a suspend-to-disk / resume cycle the
FlashMedia driver does not work at all: no message is logged in the
syslog and the SD card is not detected.
Normally this is what is logged in the syslog:
Nov  2 22:53:15 tycho kernel: tifm_7xx1: sd card detected in socket 3
Nov  2 22:53:15 tycho kernel: mmcblk0: mmc0:a95c SD256 247040KiB
Nov  2 22:53:15 tycho kernel:  mmcblk0: p1
Nov  2 23:00:33 tycho kernel: tifm_7xx1: demand removing card from socket 3
Any ideas?
Regards,
Fabio
