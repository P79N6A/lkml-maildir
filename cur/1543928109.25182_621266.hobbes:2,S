Just to verify - can you confirm that this "just fixes it" for you?
I think this is the right approach to take, and seems very safe (ie people 
who know that their loads are ok can just set the flag), but I do want to 
verify that there was nothing else going on, and that you now see the same 
performance as you did in 2.6.16?
The other alternative, of course, would be to simply allow the dirty 
percentages to be > 100%, but that's just *odd* ;)
