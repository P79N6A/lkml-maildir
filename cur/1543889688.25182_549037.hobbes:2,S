Rick Jones (HP, aka Mr Netperf.org) just recently posted some data
that happened to compare. I've clipped out thw two relevant lines below:

original posting explains the fields.
SDx (Service Demand on Transmit) is 2x more with MSI disabled. 
SDr (Service Demand on RX) is ~50% higher with MSI disabled.
Ditto for latency metrics.
ISTR to remember seeing ~5-10% difference on tg3 NICs and ~20% with PCI-X
infiniband (all on HP ZX1 chip, bottleneck was PCI-X bus).  When I posted
a tg3 patch to linux-net (which got rejected because of tg3 HW bugs), I
did NOT include any performance numbers like I thought I did. :(
hth,
