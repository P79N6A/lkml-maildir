| cdrecord neither does drop the privileges by accident nor by malice.
I wasn't trying to insult cdrecord, or even suggest it might have the
inkling of a possibility of this type of issue, and I am sorry if I made
it sound that way. I was merely trying to illustrate a use of my
proposal. I admit, I should have invented a name, like
cd-burning-fire-toaster-program to illustrate the separation of my
example from any actual existing implementation

I really wasn't talking about that. I was, however, trying to offer a
solution that would, perhaps, allow both this change, and cdrecord, to
co-exist peacefully, without running cdrecord as root.

Which is exactly what I proposed...
So... could anyone comment on my proposal, rather than just flame my
examples?
