Well, it wasn't really meant as a fix, but rather to point out that 
interactivity boosting is possible with RSDL.
It probably needs a lot more work, but just this one-liner gives an 
unbelievable ia boost.

Aside from ia boosting, I think fixed latencies per nice levels may be 
desirable, when physically possible, to allow for more deterministic 
scheduling.

Agreed.
Thanks!
