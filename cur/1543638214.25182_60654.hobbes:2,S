Whats wrong with ASCII processing? Easy to tell:
1. Look at bagtraq. (www.securityfocus.com)
2. It's making data *not agnostic* against i18n issues. This is 
something most people forgett about. /proc is LANG=en_US. ISO8859-1 - I
do not like this language.
3. For some as of jet undiscovered reason actual application programmers
hate processing it.
4. Answer 1. should be actually sufficient.
