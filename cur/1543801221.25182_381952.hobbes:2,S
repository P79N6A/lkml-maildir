Subject: 80 column line limit?

Can't we relax the 80 column line rule to something more comfortable?
These days descriptive variable/function names are much more valuable,
I think.
Just by looking at random examples in the tree, seems the 80 column
rule does more harm than good. I always find myself start shortening
names just to fit the line limit and not to need to line-wrap a statement.
We even use #defines sometimes to access simple structure members and
the like, only to fit that rule.
So, are we sure that 80 columns is still valuable, looking at the
side-effects of artificially shortended variable/function names and
line-wrapped statements, caused by this rule?
Thanks,
Kay
