Yes, depending on the mode (32R, 64R, 64V I believe). As far as I can recall
it was possible to switch mode at runtime (Pr1me 50 series, Pr1mos version
17..19).

I looked it up in some old PMA (Pr1me Macro Assembly) source: it has special
registers (FAR[01], FLR[01]: field address and field length registers) for
using these long pointers.
The 16 bits word containing the segment number has a fault bit (highest
bit) ring number (next 2 bits) and one bit possibly indicating it's a 48
bit pointer in some circumstances (I'm not sure, it has been a while...)
The remaining 12 bits form the segment number with a few exceptions. Plus
a 16 bit word number this basically addresses 2^28 16 bit words (0.5 GB).
The NULL pointer actually was not 0 but 017777600000, at least for the kernel.
The fault bit was used for system calls: a ring 0 pointer to a PL1 style
char()var string containing the _name_ of the function, with the fault
bit set was used in a PCL (procedure call) instruction. The kernel (or
maybe even the hardware) would fixup these addresses on their first fault.
