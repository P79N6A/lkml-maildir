In that case one might conjecture that the code to switch A20 on
failed because empty_8042 returns too early.
That would explain a hang (namely in a20_wait).
Right now we use 2^16 loops in empty_8042.
Since we waited infinitely long in 2.2.9, there cannot be a problem
increasing this number.
Still - surprising that 2^16 would not suffice.

[sure the hang is not something entirely different (like a LILO
 1024 cyl problem)?]
