serio, gameport. Everything is protected by a semaphore, partly for
historical reasons, partly because when adding children devices parent
devices need to be locked too...

I don't think so. Up to now all driver core iteractions were under
individual bus code control. Now out of sudden you allow disconnecting
device from its driver from outside of bus control and you are saying
that's all right. Driver core is a framework; buses use driver core to
simplify their tasks but driver core does not really control their
operations.

How can you do it cleanly? probe and remove routined do not have any idea
how they were called.

That is really sloppy. "It happens to work for 2 buses I care about so it
must be perfect"?

Let me ask again - what if we need more operations similar to [un]bind,
such as rescan? They do not use a specific driver but work for device.
If you keep bind/unbind in driver and rescan/reconnect/etc in device
subdirectoty it will be rather messy. Please consider movin in the
opposite directtion - have bind and unbind attributes of device, not
driver.
Also, what about rolling bind_mode attribute into driver core as well?
