Why don't you _share_ the App's cache with the kernel's?  That's what
mmap() and remap_file_pages() are for.

That's tough to guarantee at the platter level regardless of O_DIRECT,
but otherwise: you have fdatasync() and msync().

Take a look at remap_file_pages() and write a note here to say if it
fits the bill.  I thought remap_file_pages() was added for Oracle, but
perhaps it was for a more modern database ;)
