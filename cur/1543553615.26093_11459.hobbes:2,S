Okay. I didn't realize that's what you had in mind when you wrote
"kernfs." Mind if I ask why you didn't call it "sysctlfs" or "sysfs?"
In you earlier e-mail, you suggested that sysctl(2) would use path_walk().
Would that mean that your kernfs would have to be loaded into the kernel
and mounted for sysctl(2) to work? Or am I missing something obvious?
