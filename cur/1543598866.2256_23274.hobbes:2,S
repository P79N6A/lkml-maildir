Surely the posix standard would say.
The sol8 manpage says specifically that EINVAL is returned if len <= 0;
And an openbsd and freebsd box i tried it on happily do the mmaps as
well.
All three (linux, sol8, fbsd) segfault with the following code for various
values of x and y.
fd = open();
marea = mmap(0, x, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
munmap(marea, y);
fclose(fd);
mmap:
 linux
  succeeds
 sol8
  succeeds if x>0, fails otherwise
 fbsd4.3
  succeeds
munmap:
 linux
  succeeds unless x>0 and y>x, in which case it segfaults
 sol8
  succeeds
 fbsd
  succeeds
close:
 linux
  succeeds
 sol8
  segfaults if y>x
 fbsd
  segfaults if y>x
