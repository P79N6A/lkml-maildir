Hmm, I cant remember if it was you second last, or last version.  I
dropped it for the time being, and have not yet checked through my
patches for 2.6.9-rc1 - hopefully will get time next week, and if the
problem persist, I will let you know (should be 2.6.9-rc1-bk_something_,
so I assume your last stuff would have gone in already if it went to
Linus ...).
