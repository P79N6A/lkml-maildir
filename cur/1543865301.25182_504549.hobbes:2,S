Partially this is for the bad reason that creating "i/o threads" (or even
processes) has a bad stigma to it, and additionally has always felt crummy.
On the first reason, the 'pain' of creating threads is actually rather
minor, so this feeling may have been wrong. The main thing is that you don't
wantonly create a thousand i/o threads, whereas you conceivably might want
to have a thousand outstanding i/o requests. At least I know I want to have
that ability.
Secondly, the actual mechanics of i/o processes isn't trivial, and feels
wasteful with lots of additional copying, or in the case of threads,
queueing and posting.
