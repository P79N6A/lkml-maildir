As stated above, the problem is actually in libx86, and not in s2ram. I
have included Matthew Garrett in the CC list, as he's hosting the libx86
source code I have used as a base for my patch.
The following patch solves the segfault, by changing the mmap flags of
the video memory area, to allow execution. The patch is against
libx86-0.99 available from 
http://www.codon.org.uk/~mjg59/libx86/

I honestly don't know. From hpa's comments, it seems as is the segfault
would be the expected behaviour, but as 2.6.24 and previously doesn't
segfault, I guess it's a matter of determining if the original
non-segfaulting behaviour is by design, or a bug.
