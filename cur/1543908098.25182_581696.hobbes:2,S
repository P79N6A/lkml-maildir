If you wish.  It seems a shame since a lot of them have only one caller.

Looks like I've got a bit more cleaning up to do.  PG_private isn't set by
FS-Cache, so this bit shouldn't be here.

There shouldn't be any.
Note that due to patch #2, PG_fscache causes releasepage() and
invalidatepage() to be called in addition to PG_private.

Hmmm...  Looking at the truncate routines, I suppose this ought to be okay,
provided the cache retains a reference on the page whilst it's writing it out
(put_page() won't can the page until we release it).
It also seems dubious, though, to release the page when the filesystem is
doing stuff to it, even if it's by proxy in the cache.  I'll have to test
that, but I'm slightly concerned that the netfs could end up releasing its
cookie before the cache has finished with its pages.  On the other hand, with
the new asynchronous stuff I've done, I'm not sure this'll be an actual
problem.

Okay.

Hmmm...  How about I move the call to fscache_attr_changed() to the callers of
nfs_update_inode(), to just after the spinlock is unlocked.  The operation is
going to be asynchronous, so the delay shouldn't matter.

I hadn't come across that.  I'll have a look.

If you wish, but doesn't that violate the rules of patch division laid down by
Linus and Andrew?
