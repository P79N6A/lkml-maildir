It is a PCI bus issue.  You simply don't have enough PCI bus cycles 
available to do what you want to do.  The resource you're running out of is 
bus bandwidth, and there's nothing to be done about it, other than remove 
the PCI gfx card from the system.
If you get another dualhead AGP graphics card (anything will do), the 
problem should go away.  We have a developer who does lowlatency 
multichannel sound stuff on a machine with a Matrox G450 dualhead card no 
problem.  I expect my own system (Radeon 9800 Pro and M-Audio 1010LT audio) 
would be fine dualhead too, although I only run it singlehead at the 
moment.  The 1010LT is 10 channels in and out of 24-bit 96kHz audio and 
works great down to 1.5ms buffers, so it is no small bus load itself.
