No, only to call these functions from BSD-only (or other licensed)
modules.

I don't think we need to drop this license.  What is the harm?
At some point, Sun may want OpenSolaris to use OpenIB.  Or what if the
Darwin folks decide to create a port?
Don't worry: the OpenIB Windows work is done in a completely different
repository with a completely different code base because Microsoft was
scared of code that ever *was* GPL, even if a BSD-only fork was created.
The bylaws of OpenIB.org require that all code hosted and developed
under our auspices be (at least) BSD.  I don't want it to happen, but if
the code in Linux chooses one license (GPL) and not both, then we won't
be able to accept patches back that come in through the mainline kernel.
