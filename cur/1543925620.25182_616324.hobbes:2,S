Subject: [PATCH] proc: loadavg reading race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/12/66

The avenrun[] values are supposed to be protected by xtime_lock.
loadavg_read_proc does not use it. Theoretically this may result in an
occasional glitch when the value read from /proc/loadavg would be as much as
1<<11 times higher than it should be.
