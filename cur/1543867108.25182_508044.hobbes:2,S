Hi Oleg,
	Always happy to explain.  There's often a need to access constants in
assembler, which can only be derived from C, such as the size of a
structure, or the offset of a certain member within a structure.
Hardcoding the numbers in assembler is fragile leading to breakage when
something changes.
	So, asm-offsets.c is the solution: it uses asm() statements to emit
patterns in the assembler, with the compiler computing the actual
numbers, eg:
	#define DEFINE(sym, val) \
	        asm volatile("\n->" #sym " %0 " #val : : "i" (val))
	DEFINE(SIZEOF_FOOBAR, sizeof(foobar));
Becomes in asm-offsets.s:
	->SIZEOF_FOOBAR $10 sizeof(foobar)  #
This gets sed'd back into asm-offsets.h:
	#define SIZEOF_FOOBAR 10 /* SIZEOF_FOOBAR  # */
This can be included from .S files (which get passed through the
pre-processor).
Hope that helps!
Rusty.
