No, you have it 180 degrees off. ;)
We *do* trust the kernel to reliably duplicate the state of file handles.
So if we're about to do the whole double-fork thing and all that, we want to
loop around and close all the file descriptors we don't want leaking to
the double-forked daemon.  Yes, we do something reasonable with fd 0,1,2 -
but we probably also want to do something with that unclosed fd 3 that's still
open on /etc/mydaemon.cf, and any other file descriptors we've left dangling
in the breeze after initialization.
And yes, this sort of error happens in Real Live - I need to go and figure out
why the /sbin/lvm.static on my initrd is throwing 'File descriptor 3 left open'
messages...
