It happened and mostly ended with a flame feast.
I try to give a very short and incomplete answer to a complex question.
Having RT features integrated in the kernel itself makes it simple to do
smooth transitions of applications from the soft-RT to the hard-RT world
without changing code, recompiling. You have one set of libraries
instead of two and perfect collocation of non-RT and RT threads. Users
have only to deal with one API instead of two.
Nanokernels give you slightly better latencies and make a clear
seperation between the RT and non RT world. This seperation is better
reviewable and gives you a chance to do static code path analysis in
order to do theoretical worst case estimation, which is a prerequisite
for approvals in certain application fields.
Theres a lot more - factual and "religious", but it takes more than a
few lines and a few minutes :)
I think there will be more application areas than the unpopular
industrial/embedded stuff in the near future which would benefit from
integrated RT enhancements.
