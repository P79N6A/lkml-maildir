-Test9 was the "oddest" kernel I ever ran (since 2.2.x) - even got it
repeatably to hardlock lock by loading it a bit with dd ;)
Since then, Nick Pigin has put a hell of an effort into the
anticipatory scheduler and much else all over has been refined too.
I have done a bit of stress testing of io, network and cpu and
IMO, 2.6.3 will perform nicely in a server environment and there
will be no significant problems.
Input from production use is essential though and it would be much
appreciated if you would go for it :)
