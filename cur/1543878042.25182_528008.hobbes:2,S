At first glance your patch looks reasonable.
Unfortunately it only applies to the rare thread that calls daemonize,
and not also to kernel/kthread/kthread() which means it will miss many of
our current kernel threads.
For the sgi problem I doubt it is will make a difference but the change
is certainly worth making.
