Apologies in advance for using M-Sexchange to reply...
However Larry put it, and I'm not defending anyone here, he is at least in
one respect correct. No open source product, or even combination of smaller
apps has yet to do what BK does.
Larry... Could you clarify what would happen if you and your company were
bombed by foreign terrorists? How would BK's license fair in allowing
derivative works?

I don't usually participate in flamewars, but he's right Larry.
You just insulted most of the Open Source community, even though
you seem to be using Open Source as a bitkeeper selling point...
Besides, Open Source is the _only_ guarantee that the product
will be around in 20 years. If bitmover falls apart or gets
aquired by someone, we have no chance in hell to keep using
bitkeeper -- and that's all because of that weird licensing.
