Actually you can force Windows to accept a hardware clock in UTC:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControl/TimeZoneInformation/RealTimeIsUniversal
I'm using this on my dual-boot machine at home because I that stupid
Daylight Savings Time change twice a year really annoyed me. So far
the only downside I found is that you have to remember that the time
you enter in the BIOS has to be UTC.
