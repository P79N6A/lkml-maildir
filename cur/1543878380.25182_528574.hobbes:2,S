Subject: [PATCH] zap_other_threads: remove unneeded ->exit_signal change
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/8/65

We already depend on fact that all sub-threads have ->exit_signal == -1,
no need to set it in zap_other_threads().
