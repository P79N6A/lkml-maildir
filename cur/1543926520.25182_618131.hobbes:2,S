Why avoid list noise? These lists are made just for this. But, since
this case needs a lot of space for your configs, maybe a lot of time,
and maybe a bit more people to have a look at this as well, bugzilla
could be very useful.
Of course, like Michael said, it would be better if you could do
at least short test with a version as new as possible.

PS: I've forgot to mention: lspci -vv, cat /proc/interrupts
and maybe the same for these other, working gig-e cards.
