Wow, easy. "normal" is Linus' git. It has no volatile or anything. I
suspect the compiler to "optimize" some of the reads and sets away
(which remain after my patch is applied).
Anyway, I tried to find out the source of this and it is not that easy.
If the text is getting bigger, all references to the data section are
changed and I can't simply diff. Than I searched for two "equal" .o
files which differ in size. This was not better because gcc reorganized
the whole .o file and the functions that were at the beginning in the
first file, were at a different position in the second one.
For those who have plenty of time in their hands, I posted the four
kernels [1] and my four O= folders [2]. 
Once I have some time, I try to diff the specific function within the .o
file which used the atomic_{read|set} operation.

Yes. The inline asm is even smaller than the volatile ones, what sounds
like better optimization by the gcc (and it does exactly what volatile
was used for).
