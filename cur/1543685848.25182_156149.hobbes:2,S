Yes, a flag could be added for crypto_alloc_tfm() which disables padding
for digests (e.g. CRYPTO_TFM_DIGEST_NOPAD).
Given that there are a still a number of unresolved issues, e.g. making
the crypto api (or a subset thereof) mandatory, perhaps it would be more 
appropriate to slate these changes for 2.7 and then backport to 2.6 once 
stable.
