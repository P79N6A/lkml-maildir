Subject: [BUGFIX][PATCH] shmdt cannot detach not-alined shm segment cleanly.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a patch for a problem of shmdt().
It is found by a test, not a serious problem.
-- Kame
sys_shmdt() can manages shm segments which is covered by multiple vmas.
(This can happen when a user uses mprotect() after shmat().)
This works well if shm is aligned to PAGE_SIZE, but if not, the last segment
cannot be detached. It is because a comparison in sys_shmdt()
	(vma->vm_end - addr) < size
		addr == return address of shmat()
		size == shmsize, argments to shmget()
size should be aligned to PAGE_SIZE before being compared with vma->vm_end,
which is aligned.
