They're not functionless. You (and I) might not care for the function, but 
their function is providing a "slick" bootup. That's why so many if not 
basically all distributions of recent origin use them. Go ask Ubuntu for 
example.

But when they're hidden by a splash screen, you don't see them any better 
when they're red than when they're white. Splash screens were not mentioned 
as any sort of alternative, their prevalence was mentioned as indication 
that VGA console is only ever getting less important.
I find Alan's suggestion to provide the functionality the same way you'd 
provide for translated kernel messages (seeing as how there also are people 
that want those) much more sensible.
Rene.
