Hey, you snipped the part where I said that the application has to have 
its own locking around the loop and around the lookup to avoid races. 
We can avoid that requirement by using sequence numbers and making it a
bit more complex, but the simple version was for samba only (ie "only one
app that wants this").
Realize that none of this makes the internal kernel (or filesystem) data
structures be wrong, so even if the app has a bug and doesn't do the right
locking, at worst that just results in problems for that application, not
for the rest of the system.
But yes, if we want to make others use this, we'd need to have the kernel 
actually support some kind of locking, probably by just making the whole 
readdir loop be inside the kernel itself (at which point we can use the 
inode semaphore for this).
The "dcache full" bit could be potentially useful regardless of any
case-ignorant operating system emulation crap, although I don't see any
really obvious applications (we could speed up regular "readdir()", but we
don't have the d_offset thing, so..)
