Hi,
I have 37GB IDE disk connected to motherboard with PIIX3 controller 
and Award BIOS, that supports max. 32GB disks. 
Finally 2.2.14pre[67] recognized correctly the size:
kernel: hdc: IBM-DPTA-353750, 35772MB w/1961kB Cache, 
CHS=4560/255/63, (U)DMA
but the transfer rate measured by hdparm 3.5i was really slow, 2.7 
MB/s. No changes done by hdpardm helped.
I think that the problem is probably caused by the fact that neither 
BIOS nor Linux initialize correctly the PIIX3 IDE interface. 
When I jumpered the disk to 32GB only and let BIOS detect it, the 
transfer speed was 8.28 MB/s, the same as with other 17G drives.
Kernel 2.3.26 detected diffreent geometry:
kernel: hdc: IBM-DPTA-353750, 35772MB w/1961kB Cache, 
CHS=72680/16/63, (U)DMA
but translated it correctly:
kernel:  hdc: [PTBL] [4560/255/63] hdc1
and the speed was 8.02 MB/s.
Now the question - is there any way how to use this disk with stable 
kernel, size 37GB and transfer rate 8 MB/s?
