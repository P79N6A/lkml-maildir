Subject: [PATCH] pci-quirks: disable MSI on RS400-200 and RS480, take #2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

MSI doesn't work on RS400-200 and RS480 requiring pci=nomsi kernel
boot parameter for ahci to work.  This patch renames quirk_svw_msi()
to quirk_disable_all_msi() and use it to disable MSI on those chips.

Okay, this is the fixed version and should probably included in
-stable too as there have been quite some number of reports which got
resolved by adding 'pci=nomsi'.  Verified by Matí­as Alejandro Torres.
Thanks.
