sk_buff is used by network drivers. How can I narrow down the error 
in skb_drop_fraglist? Maybe it's a network driver problem and not 
Promise-IDE related.

I did but didn't get any reaction.
I don't know how to go on. I can't verify my configuration under 
kernel 2.6.x or 2.4.22-ac4 as 2.6.x doesn't boot (blank screen and 
yes, I tried different CONFIG_CONSOLE settings). 2.4.22-ac4 hangs 
with an oops when booting. Under 2.4.23pre1 I'm getting the same 
errors.
Can I do some debugging to narrow down the problem? I still don't 
know if the error is network or Promise driver related.
