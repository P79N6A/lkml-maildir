OK.

You could replace 2.6.16-rt29/drivers/ieee1394/ by drivers/ieee1394/
from 2.6.16.28 or later plus one of the patches from
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/updates/2.6.16.x/
 and see if it
makes a difference. But judging from the changes that went in, I would
be surprised if there was any improvement.

This is strange. The mask has bus reset and self ID received events
switched on. There is nothing manipulating this mask besides the
interrupt handler and the initialization and shutdown routines. And if
I'm not mistaken, the interrupt handler does not run concurrently to
itself for the same chip.
Ingo et al, is the -rt patched kernel fundamentally different WRT
reentrance of interrupt handlers?
