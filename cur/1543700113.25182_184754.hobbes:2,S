Hi,
Halfway between having uncompressed the kernel and starting init, the console
starts to scroll "atkbd.c: Unknown key pressed", mentioning key code 0 (IIRC),
even though no keys are pressed at all.  After a while, the scrolling stops,
but the keyboard still doesn't work.  2.4 works fine on the same hardware.
Hardware is an Intel SE7505VB2 board with dual 2.40GHz Xeon processors,
and a Logitech PS/2 "Internet keyboard."
Ideas?
thanks,
Lennert
