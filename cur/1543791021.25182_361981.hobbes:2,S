Yan,
There certainly may be a bug, but removing the lock isn't the fix. :-)
inet6_mc_check() does not have the socket locked, but is acquiring a
read lock on ipv6_sk_mc_lock.
I've looked some more into this, and I believe ip6_mc_msfilter() needs
at least a read lock on ipv6_sk_mc_lock to protect it from races with
changes to the list, just as ip6_mc_source() has.
I convinced myself at the time that the sflist does not require an
additional lock, but I don't see that now. It seems to me now that
there should be a lock on each individual socklist entry and changes
to the socket source filter should be protected by that. A simpler,
but less performant, fix would be to make both ipv6_mc_source() and
ip6_mc_msfilter() acquire ipv6_sk_mc_lock for writing, to prevent
races with inet6_mc_check's search of the sflist.
It'd be much better if only that socklist entry is locked, of course.
I'll look some more.
