Fine. I've got the patch-merge message, so the first of the series is
done.

Understood. That is where I jump in and regenerate my patches on the
latest available level. That the patches did hold up for some months in
-mm now without really breaking anything is an indication that we can
push them upstream now, isn't ? That would make the patch problem go
away and I could queue my s390 specific page table rework. Our KVM
people keep asking about it.
