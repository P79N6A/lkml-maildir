Pointer arithmetic on void * has been a gcc extension since forever
(gcc acts as though sizeof (void) == 1).
However, I somewhat agree -- it's ugly for drivers rely on this and do
arithmetic on void *.  It should be OK for a driver to use 
char __iomem * for its IO base if it needs to add in offsets, right?
