It is certainly not obscure.
ISO C99 6.4.4.1#5 says:
The type of an integer constant is the first of the corresponding list in
which its value can be represented.
For Octal or Hexadecimal Constant and no suffix, the table lists:
int
unsigned int
long int
unsigned long int
long long int
unsigned long long int
Assuming 32-bit int, 0xdeadbeef has unsigned int type.
For Decimal Constant and no suffix, the table lists only:
int
long int
long long int
and thus assuming 32-bit int and 64-bit long, 3735928559 has long int type,
assuming 32-bit int, 32-bit long and 64-bit long long, 3735928559 has long
int type.
