Hi everyone,
does the linux kernel process scheduler tackle priority inversion problems?
 - one good solution may be to randomly boost the priority of ready
processes, such that the low-priority process will release a contended
resource faster
I suppose, if there were a significant proportion of uni-processor linux
installations, it may be worth implementing a ceiling-priority scheduler.
This would negate the need for any syncronisation/lock primitives, also
eliminating deadlocks entirely. The VxWorks OS implements such a scheme,
IIRC.
For the SMP scheduler, is priority inheritance used?
