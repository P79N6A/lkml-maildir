When handling rlimit != RLIM_INFINITY, generic_write_checks tests file
position against 0xFFFFFFFFULL, and casts it to a u32.  This code is
carried forward from 2.4.4, and the 2.4-ac tree contains an apparently
obvious fix to one part of it (should set count to 0 not to a negative).
But when you think it through, it all turns out to be bogus.
On a 32-bit architecture: limit is a 32-bit unsigned long, we've
already handled *pos < 0 and *pos >= limit, so *pos here has no way
of being > 0xFFFFFFFFULL, and thus casting it to u32 won't truncate it.
And on a 64-bit architecture: limit is a 64-bit unsigned long, but this
code is disallowing file position beyond the 32 bits; or if there's some
userspace compatibility issue, with limit having to fit into 32 bits,
the 32-bit architecture argument applies and they're still irrelevant.
So just remove the 0xFFFFFFFFULL test; and in place of the u32, cast to
typeof(limit) so it's right even if rlimits get wider.  And there's no
way we'd want to send SIGXFSZ below the limit: remove send_sig comment.
There's a similarly suspicious u32 cast a little further down, when
checking MAX_NON_LFS.  Given its definition, that does no harm on any
arch: but it's better changed to unsigned long, the type of MAX_NON_LFS.
