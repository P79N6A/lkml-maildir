So nobody is twisting your arm to use Gnome and/or E.  I still use fvwm2
under Red Hat 6.0 and it works just fine.  If I don't run Netscape, I
don't have any problems with 32 MB of RAM (and I could probably run
easily in less, looking at "free").  Of course, I use X mostly just to
get bigger terminal windows (120x76 xterms are great!). :-)
