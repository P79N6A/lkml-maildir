The delimbo functions can be extended to deal with the dirty bit.
They already have to be called to make sure the cpu is looking at the
proper page flags.  The easiest solution to the races is probably to
make the delimbo pte functions flush the tlb cache to make sure the
cpu will also be looking at the correct entry to update flags.
Otherwise the atomic ptep* functions would probably need to be
modified.
