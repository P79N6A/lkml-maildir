sdparm is a command line utility designed to get and set
SCSI disk parameters (cf hdparm for ATA disks). More generally
it gets and sets mode page information on SCSI devices or devices
that use a SCSI command set (e.g. CD/DVD drives (any transport)
and SCSI tape drives). It also can list VPD pages including
the device identification page.
For more information and downloads (tarball, rpm and deb
packages) see:
http://www.torque.net/sg/sdparm.html
There are now more than 150 parameters accessed by sdparm.
Thanks to Kai Makisara for interface and sanity checking
suggestions.
