The address returned by ioremap is not a virtual address, it is a cookie
which readb/w/l etc. take as arguments.
E.g. on sparc64, ioremap returns you the physical address (ie. ioremap just
returns first argument and does nothing else) and readb and the like use
instructions to bypass caches which take that physical address (so that it
does not use any TLB entries).
