Subject: [PATCH 6/6] x86_64: enable xchg optimization for x86_64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

i386 enables the xchg based implementation of r/w semaphores for any processor
as good as 486. So it was quite interesting to see x86_64 never using it! And it
was even more interesting to see, in rwsem.h:
/* rwsem.h: R/W semaphores implemented using XADD/CMPXCHG for x86_64+
 *
 * Written by David Howells (dhowells@redhat.com).
 * Ported by Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de> to x86-64.
I.e. the implementation was written, is present in the tree, but due to this:
#ifdef CONFIG_RWSEM_GENERIC_SPINLOCK
#include <linux/rwsem-spinlock.h> /* use a generic implementation */
#else
#include <asm/rwsem.h> /* use an arch-specific implementation */
#endif
it was probably _NEVER_ compiled!!!
So, handle with care this one-liner, and test it properly.
