The comment above the test explains why that test is there in
n_tty_receive_room.  If that test isn't there, and we are doing input
canonicalization, when the buffer gets full, the low-level driver will
either flow control the source (so the ERASE or EOLN characters won't
get sent through) or the low-level driver will drop the characters
(and the line discpline will never see the ERASE or EOLN characters).  
So the idea behind this code was to lie to the low-level driver, so
that the line discpline would always get the characters, and then the
line discpline could process ERASE, WERASE, KILL, or EOL, and drop the
rest on the floor.  At least, that was the basic idea.  Yes, it was a
kludge; no I'm not particularly proud of it.
The whole structure badly needs to be ripped apart and rewritten, but
unfortunately few employers seem to be willing to dedicate their
hackers' time to Do This Right.  Sigh....
