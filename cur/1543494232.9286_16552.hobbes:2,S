I have to agree with you ;). You are right and I was just worried about
that. Ok, I think I wasted time implemented rb-trees. At least it's been
fun.

Agreed. Probably in normal usage rb-trees may scale better also because
most of files are not huge in size. But the performance drop that will
increase with the file size is bad and I agree that it's better to have a
clean design that can scale with minor changes under all scenarios.
I think tomorrow I'll drop RB-trees from here too.
If somebody think that it can make sense to have a rb-tree patch updated
with my latest changes, ask me and I'll produce it while removing
rbtrees from here (sigh!)...
