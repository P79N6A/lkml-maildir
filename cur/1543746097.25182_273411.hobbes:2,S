I think I can, havn't tried yet through.

Well, you can use the second PCI function.

I can do that as well, bttv knows anyway which ones are dvb cards and
which ones are not.

cx88-dvb has a PCI ID table.  The cx2388x has a separate PCI function
for the MPEG stuff which makes it a bit easier to get that handled
by hotplug directly ;)
