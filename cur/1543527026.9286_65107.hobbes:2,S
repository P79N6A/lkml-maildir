nope, 2.5 stuff. You can check out the 2.3.32 patch (which has a working
purely-user-space times() syscall) at:
	
http://www.redhat.com/~mingo/vsyscall-2.3.32-F4
Documentation/syscall.txt has the design:
+
+ 'x86 Virtual System Call Interface',  Ingo Molnar <mingo@redhat.com>
+
+ The point is to have an extensible system call interface. The kernel
+ provides a generic entry point, which is a readonly user-visible page
+ range. User-space does not know about the internals of this entry
+ point, it's a simple generic function call.
+
there are several 'trampoline pages' (both data and code) which are
'dual-mapped': kernel-space has a read-write mapping to the data page,
user-space only has a read-only mapping. This is how sys_times() works.
it's in the prototype stage, but pretty promising IMO, will post a
finished patch once the 2.5 is branched off.
