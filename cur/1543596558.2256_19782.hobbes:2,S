Wouldn't that be the same as including metadata in the files itself? The
only thing that's different in this approach is that the metadata isn't
included into the code itself, but in a seperate database.
But, maybe this isn't such a bad idea, because it is a _damn_ pain.... :)
I'm currently working on some code to make this website I was talking about,
and I'll include this as soon as it works well enough.
