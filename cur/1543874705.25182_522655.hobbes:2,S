Sorry, I meant "setting them to __KERNEL_DS" here.

And that's what's _not_ happening in the code as I mentioned in original post.

I've searched the code for such case (setting xds to __KERNEL_DS _After_ 
copy_thread()) with no success. As I understand, the kernel thread 
executes the passed function immediately (when given control by scheduler):
i386/kernel/process::kernel_thread():
**	regs.ebx = (unsigned long) fn;
	regs.edx = (unsigned long) arg;
	regs.xds = __USER_DS;
	regs.xes = __USER_DS;
	regs.xfs = __KERNEL_PDA;
	regs.orig_eax = -1;
**	regs.eip = (unsigned long) kernel_thread_helper;
	do_fork(...)
entry.S::kernel_thread_helper (removing CFI_* pseudo ops):
   ENTRY(kernel_thread_helper)
	pushl $0		
	movl %edx,%eax
	push %edx
**	call *%ebx
	push %eax
	call do_exit
Am I interpreting the forking process completely wrong?. I'm just curious why 
the __USER_DS is playing a vital rule in kernel threads regs/stack ?
Thanks alot,
