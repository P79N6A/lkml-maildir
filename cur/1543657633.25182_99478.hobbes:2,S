Before jumping to conclusions, go check out the site, read the licences
etc. If i rember correctly some modules are under a BSD like licence
(correct me if i'm wrong). I don't think the utah-glx folk are using the
kernel (kernel modules), but i haven't looked close enouth at it (and
dosn't seam like you did too).
