I recently came into possession of a 97-key keyboard with Japanese
markings on the keys.  (The keys also have the standard
qwerty-characters on them, with the exception of some of the meta-keys
(there are 3 keys near the Alt keys on either side of the spacebar with
only Japanese characters on them so I don't know what they are.)
In any case, the keyboard sends out scancodes that work for all the main
keys (backspace, letters and numbers, enter, shift), but the numeric
keypad, Alt keys, and function keys don't work.
I have run the board through showkey -s, so I know what all the
scancodes this keyboard sends out.  They all appear to be non-escaped.
Some of these are in the under-88 range, but modifying pc_keyb.c to
allow setkeycodes to work in this range was trivial.  However, the F9
and F10 keys send out c0 and c1, respectively, so their key release
events send out e0 and e1, confusing the keyboard driver.  How would I
go about changing this (or who should I talk to that might be able to do
this?)  I assume that simply ignoring prev_scancode would solve this (at
the expense of breaking the escaped keys on a standard keyboard.)
BTW, I have only tested this by unplugging another (standard) keyboard
and plugging this one in its place, so I don't know if it gets
initialized properly (I couldn't figure out from the source if that only
happens at boot time.)  Any advice from someone who knows more about
keyboard hardware is appreciated.
