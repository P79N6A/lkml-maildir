I've worked out the part of the problem involving that quirk.  There's
an entry in quirks.c which reads:
/*
 *      VIA northbridges care about PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE
 */
int interrupt_line_quirk;
static void __devinit quirk_via_bridge(struct pci_dev *pdev)
{
        if(pdev->devfn == 0)
                interrupt_line_quirk = 1;
}
The i386 pirq_enable_irq honors this:
        /* VIA bridges use interrupt line for apic/pci steering across
           the V-Link */
        else if (interrupt_line_quirk)
                pci_write_config_byte(dev, PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE, dev->irq);
The matching function in ACPI does not honor this quirk, so we probably
have routing troubles on a lot of affected VIA northbridges.  There's
at least one thing which looks like an example of this in Bugzilla
(which was "fixed" by twiddling the IRQ balancing code).  With this
patch I get a little better (more predictable, at least) behavior.

On the down side, this doesn't fix everything.  I can observe that with
XMMS paused and my USB trackball untouched, I get no interrupts to
either the au88xx's IRQ or the UHCI's IRQ.  But with the sound playing,
I get about 1.8 times as many IRQs reported to the USB controller as I
do to the sound card!  I assume vice versa is true also, though I can't
check right now (both are wedged again).
Something else is still cross-connecting the USB IRQ (11) and the
au88xx IRQ (19).  I had hoped it was the above problem, but it appears
not.  I hand-verified that PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE now agrees with
/proc/interrupts for everything - except for the bridge itself; Jeff
Garzik's comment in quirks.c suggests that this is expected.
Any ideas on what could cause this are much appreciated.  Should I use
bugzilla to track this problem?
