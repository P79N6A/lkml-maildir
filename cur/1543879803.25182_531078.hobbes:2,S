I'm not too attached to a particular name. I just think that the
traditional counter names should pass readability/etc. criteria on
account of the very strong historical precedent. I'd consider more
verbose affairs for the sake of putative legibility as equivalent
in quality. Maybe that means others voting for the more verbose
names should result in an aggregate decision in favor of verbosity.
