	Reminds me of the difference in between Celeron and XEON
	variants of Pentium II -- Celerons can cache only the low
	4 GB of address space, XEONs can cache whole 36 bits.
	(Propably other differences exist also, but that is primary
	 one concerning memory cacheability --> apparent speed.)

	Hmm.. More marketing names, what is "Cascades" in the scale
	of "cheap bastards" versus "all bells and whistless" ?
	(Celeron vs. XEON, that is.)
