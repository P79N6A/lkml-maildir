Again, you are wrong, as per the recommendations of every lawyer I have
ever talked to (and unfortunatly, that's a lot...)
It's fine for you to feel differently, and you yourself can act however
you want to, but as you do not hold any copyright on any portions of the
Linux kernel code, please do not speak as if your statements hold any
weight.
In the end, it's up to the copyright holders to enforce the license.
And as I have stated in the past, a number of them have made public
statements as to what they think about this issue.  And it corresponds
exactly with what Marcel has stated above.
So if you wish to violate the copyright of others, you take the risk
that you might be caught and punished, something that you and your legal
council needs to take into account.
