No, people are still working on getting this right.

No, this puts back the problem where if the hotplug() subsystem call
fails, we have already incremented the seqnum without emitting a call
with that number.
Now I know userspace needs to handle this properly anyway, but we might
as well get the kernel right, and not do stuff to make userspace unhappy
if we can obviously help it.
I'll work on fixing this up properly tomorrow,
thanks,
