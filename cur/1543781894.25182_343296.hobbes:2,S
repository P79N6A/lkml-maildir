Subject: 2.6.13-rc6-mm1: why is PHYLIB a user-visible option?

Is there any reason why PHYLIB is a user-visible option?
As far as I understand it, PHYLIB and the MII PHY device drivers are an 
internal library drivers should start to use roughly similar to MII.
But in this case, the options shouldn't be user-visible.
