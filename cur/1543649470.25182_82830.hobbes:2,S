there is no point for this last patch. The vsyscall_ptr is the vsyscall
number.
This is equivalent to a proc that shows the syscall number of
sys_gettimeofday, useless, cat on unistd.h and vsyscall.h will avoid a
waste of kernel mem.
the uml folks need to replace the vsyscalls, they just know their
address, like they just know the syscall number of sys_gettimeofday.
