While I agree it is tricky to sort out OS V. SMI issues it really
doesn't matter if
your SMI periods are less than your OS period.  If you OS blocks as long as
your SMI then it is hard to say for sure.
One class of SMI is periodic. Looking though latency data and looking for
periodic events might be handy.  Say if every X seconds you experience extra
latency you can pretty much bet that is an SMI.
Just had an interesting idea. Why not just boot Linux as far as early console
access and put the test loop in right then and there?

I will be sending out a RFC with our implementation.  On a few platforms the
firmware supports turning off all "non-fatal" SMIs.  There is a small driver
to interface with the BIOS and some userspace bits.
