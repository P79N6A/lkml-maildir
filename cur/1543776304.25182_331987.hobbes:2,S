Subject: [PATCH] fix use after free in smbfs.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From code inspection it seems that after freeing 'req', in smb_request()
we continue to dereference it a dozen or so times.
That whole area of code looks suspect.
		...
        smb_lock_server(server);
        if (!(req->rq_flags & SMB_REQ_RECEIVED)) {
            list_del_init(&req->rq_queue);
            smb_rput(req);
        }
smb_rput() also does a list_del_init, but only if its safe
to do so (ie, the refcount has dropped to 0).
To my not-smbfs-savvy eyes, it would seem that we could
potentially nuke the ->rq_queue list, and return from
smb_rput() if the request was still in use. What the rest
of the code does with such a buggered-up request, I've no
idea, but it probably isn't pretty.
Perhaps smb_rput should be taking a pointer to a request that can
be null'd on success ?

Looking further, we do exactly the same thing in smb_request_recv()
        smb_rput(req);
        wake_up_interruptible(&req->rq_wait);
    }
ditto in smbiod.c..
What am I missing here?  smb_rput() -> smb_free_request() does
a kmem_cache_free(req_cachep, req); making further use of that
cache item invalid.
