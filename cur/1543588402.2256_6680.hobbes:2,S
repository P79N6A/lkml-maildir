mmh. But isn't that obvious? Every time you mess with anything (counters
or rules) of the chains/tables, your accounting program will get into
trouble, if it relies on those counters.
I don't think that it makes sense to do iptables-based accounting if you have
changes to the ruleset (counters and/or rules) at runtime. You'd have 
to be very cautious what you are doing.
