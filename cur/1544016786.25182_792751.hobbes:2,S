I think Chinang does, but he's out of office today.  He did say in an
earlier reply:

So if the reschedule interrupt is happening twice as often, and the
context switch rate is basically unchanged, I guess that means the
scheduler is doing a lot more work to get approximately the same
results.  And that seems like a bad thing.
Again, it's worth bearing in mind that these are all RT tasks, so the
underlying problem may be very different from the one that both James and
I have observed with an Atom laptop running predominantly non-RT tasks.
