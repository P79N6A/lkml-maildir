I don't know, if they properly handle out of memory errors. It have been 
X-programms.
Logon wasn't able either with login nor with ssh from remote (sshd 
couldn't fork).

That's definitly right.

A process which doesn't need any more memory is running well. In 
consoles, on which I have been logged in, I could roll through the last 
commands without any problem - but I couldn't start a new process.

The memory wich has been freed is eaten up from the malicious program. 
It's very easy to reproduce it with the program I linked to in my first 
posting.

That's it. And if there is a program running with such a malfunction the 
machine can't do anything more. If a hacker wants to block your machine, 
he can do it without beeing root.

I think, that's what would be best. Ressources are given to groups and 
they must work with. There isn't any more for them - the rest is for 
sysadmins to ensure that they always can successfully control the 
machine and can kill malicious processes. No external reachable daemon 
must be running in the sysadmin ressource-group.
I think it's something like ressource-management on IBM's S390.
