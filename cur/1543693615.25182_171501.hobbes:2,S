I was being specific in what I said :)
Sure, shared interrupts can still call a driver's handler.
But if the driver doesn't stop _its own_ hardware from generating 
interrupts, you've got screaming interrupts the minute it issues 
free_irq and signals it doesn't care anymore.  The driver damn well 
better be able to stop the _NIC hardware_ from generating interrupts :)
