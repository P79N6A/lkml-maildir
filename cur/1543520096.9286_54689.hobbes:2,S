What I tried to do is to just free _clean_ pages when short on
memory. I did not want to touch anything else in order not to break
some balance. That do_try_to_free_pages(0) should kill one clean
page. (Do you have idea how to write it in short piece of code?)

Kreclaimd should not try to swap out anything...

Does that mean that I should call shrink_mmap(6, 0) instead?
