Big problem with this is when your root device is on a (for example) plug
and play SCSI or IDE controller... there are some ways to work around it
using an initrd but that's kind of a pain IMO and is hard to work with in
the case of installs.  The kernel really needs to do detection and
enabling before root filesystem is mounted IMO.
