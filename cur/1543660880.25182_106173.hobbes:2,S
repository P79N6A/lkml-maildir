Primarily it appears that just another ZONE needs to be added, and then
free_area_init needs to be passed the proper parameters.  
I still want to look closely at how the discontig mem case for NUMA is
setup.  It is probably nothing to worry about but I want to make
certain it does not have any perverse behavior and also I want to be
certain I know how to setup a NUMA system properly, since I am looking
at the code anyway.
