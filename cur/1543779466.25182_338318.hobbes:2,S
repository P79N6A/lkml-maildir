Could you get me some more information about the hang? A stacktrace would 
be useful.
Well the device is able to run X so I guess that a slow kernel compile 
would work. At least the embedded device that I used to work on was 
capable of doing that (but then we had Debian on that thing which made 
doing stuff like that very easy).
