Well there are (at least) two reasons to do shared bus: IP over SCSI and 
cluster filesystems. At least for cluster filesystems I think the answer 
is "don't suspend your machine" for the foreseeable future - what 
happens if your machine goes to sleep while holding cluster FS locks, 
etc. I doubt any CFS vendors are going to bother to support this any 
time soon, since it's a HA/server feature and power management is really 
a desktop/laptop feature.
