With the difference that the swap code doesn't impact the I/O read/write
performances at all, and outside bigmem.c it's been a two liner change.
If your object is to put the bounce-buffer in ll_rw_block and to allow the
bigmemory to go into the page-cache IMHO you'll slowdown the system too
much. The buffer copies trashes the CPU cache. I thought to do that too (I
think I also mentioned that in one of my first emails about bigmem).
Supposing you can deal with the slowdown, for the filesystem read and
writes you don't have a buffer alone, but you have the page-cache, so in
ll_rw_block you can't simply duplicate a buffer and invalidate the old one
since the new buffer must live in the place of the old buffer. So you'll
have to play with the pagecache too and not only with ll_rw_block.
