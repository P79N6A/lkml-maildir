Hmm, I wouldn't call this the answer. How about:
 - Q: why does it fail ?
 - A: because you're initializing
 - solution: but since you're calling from a module, and the call
   goes back to the same module, you don't have to worry
This raises the question: why is this a special case ? The
registration function shouldn't have to know all these details.
(That's the whole point of try_module_get, isn't it ?)
Wouldn't it be possible to simply allow try_module_get also
while the module is initializing ?

Does "unisolated" mean that try_module_get would work ? If yes,
you've already solved the problem ;-)
