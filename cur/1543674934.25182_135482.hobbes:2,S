   On CPUs that vary frequency, this will break, unless TSC scales
   with frequency. You cannot assume that this will be the case.
This is an important issue, for another reason.
The networking packet scheduler layer wants an accurate (but
cheap) high frequency time source too.
I keep forgetting to go back and deal with fixing up all of
those hairy macros in pkt_sched.h, I've added this to my TODO
list.
