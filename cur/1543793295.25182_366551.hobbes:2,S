Ah - now it makes more sense.
The key invisible fact in the gfp.h line:
  #define GFP_ATOMIC      (__GFP_VALID | __GFP_HIGH)
is that __GFP_WAIT is *not* set (making it mean don't sleep).
All the other commonly used GFP_* flags do have __GFP_WAIT.
I have no issue with ATOMIC also meaning "use emergency pool".
That's an appropriate simplication, that fits the usage well.
I just had a mental block on the invisible unset __GFP_WAIT bit.
Would you look kindly on a patch that did:
