I do not see how Open SSL can perform this work.  What needs to happen is an
inline offload processing.  In otherwords, what I want to do is rather than
using Open SSL I want to go and pass information off to the NIC driver that
will tell the NIC to perform the crypto operation...
I do not see how openSSL can help much with this, other than maybe write
something into SSL that says, if the NIC supports it, don't do crypto, but
when the packet goes out the wire, do the perscribed crypto operation
then...
