Thanks for putting some good thoughts down.

I guess I don't look at it as consistency with the MM code as being the 
primary request, but consistency in operation with the MM code from a user 
space perspective - hopefully the two goals are not divergent.

We (noMMU) folks need to have special code anyway - so why not put it there, 
and try not to increase memory footprint?
