It's vaguely surprising that that chunk is associated with the
problem.
However it seems that there's potential for a buffer reference
leak in ext2_get_branch:
        while (--depth) {
                bh = sb_bread(sb, le32_to_cpu(p->key));
                if (!bh)
                        goto failure;
                /* Reader: pointers */
                if (!verify_chain(chain, p))
                        goto changed;
                add_chain(++p, bh, (u32*)bh->b_data + *++offsets);
                /* Reader: end */
                if (!p->key)
                        goto no_block;
        }
        return NULL;
changed:
        *err = -EAGAIN;
        goto no_block;
failure:
        *err = -EIO;
no_block:
        return p;
}
See, sb_bread() bumps b_count, but on the `goto changed;'
branch we lose track of that buffer.
b_count is only 16 bits, so it's conceivable that the
count wraps to zero, and that is fatal.
It would be interesting to replace that `goto changed;' 
with { __brelse(bh); goto changed; }.  Plus maybe a
debug printk to see if we are indeed hitting that path.
I don't think this is the bug actually - if we were
leaking bh refs that easily we'd get `busy buffer'
whines at unmount.  But it merits investigation.
