You mean like Unicode 4 will be replaced by Unicode 5 or something? :)
Seriously, if there was another standard encompassing all languages
and characters, why would they call it something different?

You've said this many times before, without explanation.
As far as I know, Unicode is a superset of all pre-existing computer
charsets used anywhere - but do feel free to correct me.
Unicode does have its problems - but what possible advantage does
_any_ known non-Unicode charset have over Unicode, apart from space saving?
You mention that Unicode doesn't well support language identification.
This is true - but the non-Unicode charsets (koi8-r etc.) don't
support that either!  Or do they?

Actually the kernel does have a line editor which needs to know a little.

We are all laughing ;)
