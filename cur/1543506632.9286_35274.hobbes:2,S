Why don't you try GRUB? It's free, and it already can load Linux, but it's
native environment is more performant - it can load any size image, it
works in protected mode, easily configurable, a lot more user friendly
than LILO, and it can load the image file even from fat filesystem.
Plus it can supply the kernel with lots of usable information (the boot
device, parameters, and the memory size [even over 64Mb]). I say you
should give it a try.
