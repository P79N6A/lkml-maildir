I'm sorry, I should have said this before.  Yes, it occurs.  You simply
need to have an interface in the down state, plugged into a network that
will not auto-assign an address.  Then, modprobe netconsole, and don't
specify what the local IP address is.  Believe it or not, I have a bug
filed on this.  ;)
