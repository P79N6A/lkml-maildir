NOTE: I can reproduce here. The strange thing is that I noticed the bad
behaviour only since I upgraded the modem to a 56k capable modem (with the
old trusted 28.800 one upload was working fine as far I can tell).
I am using 2.3.18ac10 + all my kernel patches.
Actually I can workaround with:
	ifconfig ppp0 txqueuelen 50
I'll try to understand what's going on in the next days...
