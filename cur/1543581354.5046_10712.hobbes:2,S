Hmm, this adds a lot of steps between the first occurrence of the problem
and the first useful diagnostic message. I think telephone support people
would really hate to walk their customers through this ...
Besides, people may not have the patience or knowledge to retry, and
pursue other theories first, possibly causing more damage. Of course,
readily available diagnostics can't stop them, but they may at least make
it a bit more likely that people do the right thing.
