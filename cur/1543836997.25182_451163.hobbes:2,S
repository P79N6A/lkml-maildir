CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START has had 2 uses.
1) To allow a kernel to run a completely different address for use
   with kexec on panic.
2) To allow the kernel to be better aligned for better performance.
For maintenance reasons I propose we introduce CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN.
Which will round our load address up to the nearest aligned address
and run the kernel there.  That is roughly what I am doing on x86_64
at this point.
s/CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START/CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN/ gives me well defined
behavior and allows the alignment optimization without getting into 
weird semantics.
Before CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START we _always_ ran the arch/i386 kernel
where it was loaded and I assumed we always would.  Since people have
realized better aligned kernels can run better this assumption became
false.  Going to CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN allows us to return to the
simple assumption of always running the kernel where it is loaded
modulo a little extra alignment.
