Yesterday, I compiled 2.6.0-test7 for one of my Alpha boxes.  I have
an AX8817X based USB ethernet adaptor connected to it (it's short on
PCI slots), so I compiled the usbnet module.  When I loaded usbnet, I
got a BUG at include/asm-generic/dma-mapping.h:19.  Apparently, DMA
setup only works with PCI here.  How should this be fixed?  It worked
with -test4, albeit slowly, for other reasons.
