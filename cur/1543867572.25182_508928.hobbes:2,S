Subject: [patch 2/3] fs: buffer don't PageUptodate without page locked
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

__block_write_full_page is calling SetPageUptodate without the page locked.
This is unusual, but not incorrect, as PG_writeback is still set.
However the next patch will require that SetPageUptodate always be called
with the page locked. Simply don't bother setting the page uptodate in this
case (it is unusual that the write path does such a thing anyway). Instead
just leave it to the read side to bring the page uptodate when it notices
that all buffers are uptodate.
