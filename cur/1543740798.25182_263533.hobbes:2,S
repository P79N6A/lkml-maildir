Like I said, the relevant fix is in *after* 2.6.9, in the current sources
you can get now from bk/bkcvs or snapshots.

Thanks.  I have verified that your test case produces the leak without my
patch, and has no leak with my patch.  The patch is in current sources but
not 2.6.9, and you can find it here:

Thanks,
