I can see that your numbers are equal in both cases. You have openssl 0.9.8d,
and doing functions benchmarks. I observed this on openssl 0.9.6 + apache 1.3
+ mod_ssl. The difference in terms of hits/s was 1 to 2, just with -DREENTRANT.
Most probably some water has flowed under the bridges since... Anyway, that
makes 0.9.8 interesting to look at ;-)
