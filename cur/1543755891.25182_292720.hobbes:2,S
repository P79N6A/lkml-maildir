It would.  This would certainly solve this problem.

Ouch.  Yes, it would rather, wouldn't it.  How very annoying of it.  I
guess the ->nomap way is the only sane way to deal with this then.  I
suppose it is also possible to do it via writepage by scanning for and
locking pages if present in writepage and if not present go direct to
disk (using bio or bh) whilst holding exclusive lock so no new pages can
be added to the page cache with stale data.  Or actually we wouldn't
even care if stale pages are added as they would still be cleared in
readpage().  And pages found and uptodate and locked simply need to be
marked dirty and released again and if not uptodate they need to be
cleared first.  This might actually turn out the easiest for ntfs at
least and it should avoid the deadlocks that would be caused by trying
to add new pages to the page cache.  Its maybe not as clean as a write
on a read-only page causing a fault handler to be triggered but it
should work I think.  Comments?

Is your driver's source available to look at?
