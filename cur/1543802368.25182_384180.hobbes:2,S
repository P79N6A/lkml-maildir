This is exactly the opposite of what Linus proposes in his management 
style document: "Avoid making decisions". At the moment, nobody seems to 
know what the "right" direction is, because the right direction is the 
one that will produce the better wireless support, and not the one that 
sounds better at the moment.
I therefore also vote for merging both stacks.

You were right if there were ten, but there seem to be only two at the 
moment. One stack will survive and one will die. There's no point in 
deciding this now.
