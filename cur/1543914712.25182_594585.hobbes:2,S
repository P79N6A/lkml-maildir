I already had these patches, except for #4.
Your email client is space-stuffing the patches, so I have to do s/^ / /g
to apply them.  Please see
http://mbligh.org/linuxdocs/Email/Clients/Thunderbird
 and/or the
soon-to-be-merged Documentation/email-clients.txt
I plan on folding all of
add-vmcoreinfo.patch
add-vmcore-cleanup-the-coding-style-according-to-andrews-comments.patch
add-vmcore-add-nodemask_ts-size-and-nr_free_pagess-value-to-vmcoreinfo_data.patch
add-vmcore-use-the-existing-ia64_tpa-instead-of-asm-code.patch
add-vmcore-add-a-prefix-vmcoreinfo_-to-the-vmcoreinfo-macros.patch
into a single patch for upstream.
