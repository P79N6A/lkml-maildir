.cz: 	Czech Republic
.vutbr:	Technical University of Brno
.fit:	Faculty of Information Technology
merlin:	a Linux server serving home directories and login accounts to
        students
So it's likely a student doing the 'bk clone'.
What's surprising is that merlin shouldn't have a slow network
connection - quite the opposite - it's near the academic backbone of the
Czech Republic (a 2.5 gbit/sec pipe).
But maybe something doesn't work correctly - some NAT or MTU problem
stopping the communication ...
Or it's indeed an evil student.
The administrative contact for that machine is linux@fit.vutbr.cz.
I hope this helps.
