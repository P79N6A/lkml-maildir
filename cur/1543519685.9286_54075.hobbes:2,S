Subject: PPC SMP broken in 2.2.14pre14

I recently downloaded the 2.2.14pre14 patch and applied it to my 2.2.13 tree
and recompiled the kernel for one of my two dual processor PPC (both are
Power Mac 9600/200MP) based machines.  When I rebooted I discovered that the
new kernel no longer recognizes both processors in my machine.
I repeated the process compiling both a 2.2.13 and 2.2.14pre14 with the
identical config files and problem still occurred.  I think PPC SMP may have
been broken somewhere in the 2.2.14pre series.  I will attempt to determine
which exact pre-patch the problem first occurred but thought I would mention
this now.  I'd hate to see something that was working go backwards in the
2.2.x tree, but perhaps this support was removed on purpose.
Later,
Tom
