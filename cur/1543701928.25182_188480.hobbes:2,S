Yes, that is what one commonly calls to enumerate.  Let us say,
an effective way, given some integer, to find the associated device.
[You can leave the mathematics out - this enumerable is not the same as
denumerable or countable. The set of devices on earth is finite.]

If there is no effective way to find a disk given some number,
there may very well be an effective way to find a number given some disk.
And indeed, there usually is.

Most of my devices do have them...

Ah, wait! You also have heard about devices with serial numbers! Good!
It is those devices I was talking about. Remember? ["important special case"]

True. Provided that it knows how to get them.
The kernel driver knew all about the device.
Must udev also know all about all possible devices? Do I/O to these devices?
Or must sysfs export all data that could possibly be used?
