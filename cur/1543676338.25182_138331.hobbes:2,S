   Manfred, I'm readdressed this mail to you because according to google,
   you're the original author of the patch
   (
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2002-02/0032.html
).
   Like I stated earlier, I think this code simply makes no sense on a
   platform with I/O MMU.  Hence my suggestion to deal with this via
   dma_supported().
David, what is blk_max_low_pfn set to on your ia64 systems?
