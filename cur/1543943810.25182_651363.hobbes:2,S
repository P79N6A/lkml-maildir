Indeed. I just do not have time to do so. A day-time job that
is not about kernel-hacking, three kids and a wife etc. consumes
some decent amount of time and leaves only a few hours for linux.
And I am a strange person that actually needs to sleep several
hours each night (as my baby daughter permits me to).
I promote the "select HAVE_*" style on all new stuff and expect that
a herd of janitors one day pick it up and convert most of the old-style
stuff.
And if you look around then you will see that for this merge window
almost all new stuff used "select HAVE_" so we on the right track.
