Teardrop was already mentioned.
Lately, in 2.2.9 there was one spurious kfree_skb(skb) which allowed
attackers to cause kernel oopses.
After this was reported to l-kernel, Alan found a fix a few hours later. I
don't have the bug report any more, but I still have Alan's mail from Jun 1.
Check vger archives. (I can send you Alan's posting by priv. mail, if you
like.)
Also the pentium f00f bug comes to mind, but you have to ask vger archives
for that.
