Thanks for your explanation, now I see what you mean.
But don't we already discussed this issue? I think that RUSAGE_SELF
case always not 100% accurate, so it is Ok to ignore this race.
What if that thread has not exited yet? We take tasklist lock, but
this can't help, because this thread possibly updates it's ->xtime
right now on another cpu, and we have exactly same problem.

I think it is better not to complicate the code unless we can see
some difference in practice.
That said, I don't have a strong feeling that I am right (on both
issues), so please feel free to ignore me.
