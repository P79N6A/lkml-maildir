Subject: When did UFS read-write work?

I've tried to copy a small file to a partition mounted as ufstype=44bsd.
It hanged while doing
	open("file", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_LARGEFILE, 0100644)
Second time, there was no hang, but there was no file on UFS partition
too.
Rebooting to OpenBSD:
	~ $ cd linux/		<=== created by Linux
	~/linux $ ls -la
	ls: .: No such file or directory
Does anyone remeber when UFS rw was OK?
