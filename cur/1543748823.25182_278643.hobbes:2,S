Alan, 
Sorry for the late answer, I've been rather busy of late. Today I had the time 
to recompile and test the drive.
I'm currently using the drive with a udelay of 110, and it works without any 
problems. The transfer speed is indeed higher than with the 200msec delay ;)
Hope this helps, maybe this can now be integrated into the main kernel so 
people no longer have a problem with it :)
If you need more information, feel free to ask.
Jan
