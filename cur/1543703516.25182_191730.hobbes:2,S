The problem is something I accidently neglected to respond to in your
previous note.  Those controllers aren't drop-in substitutes for one
another, and you seemed to be assuming they were.

That's where I accidentally trimmed out a response.  It's wrong; those
controllers are not equivalent in general.  Gadget drivers that work with
one controller will not automagically work with another.  Two quick examples
should illustrate the point:
  (i) A "video" gadget driver would requires isochronous transfer support.
      But only two of those controllers support that (net2280, pxa2xx_udc).
      So a video (or audio) class gadget driver would depend on configuring
      an appropriate controller ... and even then, it'd probably compile in
      more code if it's talking to a controller that supports high bandwidth
      transfer modes (up to 24 MByte/sec) than one maxing ouat a 1 Mbyte/sec.
(ii) Essentially every controller has endpoints that differ from the others
      in capabilities like addressing, direction, supported packet sizes
      transfer modes, or throughput.  All of those are things that MUST be
      reported to the USB host in device descriptors.
      The differences are currently all handled by conditional compilation.
      Until a gadget driver has that support for a particular controller,
      it shouldn't be possible to configure that combination.
There's some work afoot to do more autoconfiguration, but it won't be able
to handle all the issues for all drivers.  I have hopes that at least some
simple configurations -- two endpoints for bulk data (IN/OUT) and one
for status (interrupt IN), for example -- will be able to autoconfigure
at some point.

Absolutely certain.  Yes, tried on multiple machines.  Did you try
it on RH9?  Since it's working for you, I wonder if that's the source
of the difference.  Same bug in xconfig, gconfig, and menuconfig;
doesn't make a lot of sense to me but then I've not looked at that
code in any case.
