I won't argue since honestly, not doing it is much easier for me.  But I
want to be sure I'm clear.
What I suggested is to have the first part of the global page be
   .p2align 3
   jmp sysenter_label
   .p2align 3
   jmp sysenter_label
   ...
   .p2align
   jmp userlevel_gettimeofday
sysenter_label:
  the usual sysenter code
userlevel_gettimeofday:
  whatever necessary
All this would be in the global page.  There is only one sysenter call.
