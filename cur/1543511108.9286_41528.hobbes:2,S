With the inode-dynamic code and with the 2.3.x page-cache select_dcache
seems to be not interesting anymore. As first because we are not able to
release the inode pages so we must left the inode there while it has pages
queued. And as second because I don't care to release dentries with inodes
queued in them as I can allocate as many inodes as I need with the
inode-dynamic code. The dcache and icache now are separated and I don't
rely on magic a select_dcache() to be sure to not leak the system with the
icache.
I believe it make no sense to rotate the LRU of the dcache and that I
should simply shrink things in LRU order. Avoiding select_dcache will also
avoid a pass on the dcache lru.
If something we may leather add a reference bit to the i/dcache exactly as
we do with the page-LRU and such bit will be efficient handled and will
give us a real information of the LRU objects (and not only a heuristic
based on the number of pages queued).
Here it is a patch against my inode-dynamic patch that can be found here:
