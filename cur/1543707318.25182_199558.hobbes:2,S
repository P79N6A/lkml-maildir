Not it is not.  C standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (E)), section 6.7.2.1.
10 ...  If enough space remains, a bit-field that immediately follows
   another bit-field in a structure shall be packed into adjacent bits
   of the same unit. ...
13 Within a structure object, the non-bit-field members and the units
   in which bit-fields reside have addresses that increase in the order
   in which they are declared. ...
There is no scope for a compiler to reorder the members or the bit
fields of a structure.
