I don't know where you get that from.  The notice went in on 30 April
2007 and we gave you six months to convert the drivers, hence the
October 2007 date for when the deletion will actually be done.  I've
actually delayed removal until February 2007 giving you a further three
months.  Even then I only removed the drivers because they no longer
compile.
I think nine months isn't unreasonable for a feature removal ... unless
you work on a different time scale from me?
