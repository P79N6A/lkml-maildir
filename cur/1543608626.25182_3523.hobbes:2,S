Sorry for replying to my own message, but i just tested 2.2.18 & 2.2.19 with 
Hedrick's ide patches and they work flawlessly. I now tested for data 
corruption and on 2 subsequent reads of a CD, it produces slightly different 
data or simply aborts the read. I now tested both with ide-cd and ide-scsi. 
Both fail. ide-cd fails on read and ide-scsi on read & write. I plan to test 
with another CDRW drive just to be sure the drive isn't the problem.
