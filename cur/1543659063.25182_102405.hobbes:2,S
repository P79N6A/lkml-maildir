OK, *please* explain to me in little words so I can understand.
Variable-sized arrays are C, as of C99.  They've been a GNU extension
forever.
While gcc 2.95.4 generates fairly horrible code, gcc 3.0 does better
(the two compilers I have on my laptop).
Both generate correct code.
Speed is certainly of absolutely no importance here.
Changing it to do a kmalloc every time around the loop is complex,
inefficient, unneccessary, and introduces another failure path.
In summary, I can't see any reason why the clearest, simplest code
should be avoided.
Rusty.
