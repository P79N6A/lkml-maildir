Yeah, this was at system shutdown (/etc/init.d/hotplug stop) - I have 
USB compiled as modules, so I presume they auto-unloaded?  I've got no 
USB devices attached, so that's easy, and I use the UHCI driver (not the 
alternate driver - should I try that one or is this a lower level problem?).
Alright... a 2.5.3 with no extras boots fine (with init=/bin/bash) and 
can load and unload hotplug several times without OOPSing.  So it 
appears to be something else.  Hope that helps.
