I don't think it's software. At least it's definitely not locking. It's
happening on machines where none of the drivers missing the locks are
used (only ftape and analog joystick).
I think it's the old Neptune bug biting us again. I'd like to verify
this theory - do you have any list of people who've seen the VIA bugfix
triggered on non-VIA hardware? Some might be willing to test
experimental patches ...
... like the one attached. It doesn't add anything that already hasn't
been there, but:
	1) Should be safe for machines that have
	   a different bug than VIA. It'll print a message
	   but won't reset the timer if the > LATCH reading
	   isn't persistent.
	2) Should printk enough data to shed some light
	   on what is triggering the VIA check.
Patch against 2.4.15-pre4.
