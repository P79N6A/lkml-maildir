Hmmm ok I just noticed this and I haven't read that DMA mapping
document yet. I'll have to look at it to see how it affects PCI
devices that are 64 bit address capable.
The one thing for the m68k is that we have very few machines with
PCI, though we still suffer a lot from the DMA coherency problem on
the busses we do have.
The place where this is a real problem is in drivers where data is
shared between the adapter and the host CPU, for instance the 53c7xx
driver. On the m68k we currently use a kernel_set_cachemode() function
to change the caching of the page allocated for the shared structures,
but thats a pretty non portable way of doing it. I would like to see
something a get_free_cachecoherent_page() interface instead, what do
you think of that?
