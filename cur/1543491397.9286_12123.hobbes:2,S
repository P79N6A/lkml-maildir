I disagree, do not forget that a bus locked transaction just does this: it
goes to the bus and performs a Read-Modify-Write operation which requires
a) arbitration for bus ownership and b) several bus clocks to perform the
operation. With CPU to bus clock ratios around 5 these days, this is tens
of CPU clocks as a minimum and is very dependant on current bus
utilization (snoop cache writebacks, other CPUs and PCI bridge
transactions). I would think that the following in a _single_ asm:
	pushl %ecx
	xorl %eax,%eax
	pushl %ebx
	cpuid
	popl %ebx
	rdtsc
	popl %ecx
will be faster and have a more reproducible timing (especially on SMP). 
The xorl instruction gives well defined return value and protects against
possible variations of CPUID timing on input value.  It's about 3 bytes
longer than the solution with 'lock addl' but is unlikely to perform any
bus transaction since only uses memory locations which have a high
probability of being in the cache.
