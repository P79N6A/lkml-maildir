Yes but that would be because you leave an active journal and do changes 
behind its back without telling the OSX HFSPlus driver that you have done 
changes behind its back...  My suggestion was to tell the driver that you 
have done changes behind its back so it will be happy.
Anyway, you are the maintainer, you decide.  I was only highlighting how 
you could do it safely.
I compile my own kernels so I can always edit your patch out (I happen to 
want to write to journalled hfs+ volumes)...
Best regards,
