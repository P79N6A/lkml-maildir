Much as I hate to say so, I am NOT able to duplicate that here - I've
just followed that exact set of instructions with 2.2.0.pre3 and did
not experience either the "strange jump" (whatever that means) or the
error reported in the final stage.
Setup on this box is essentially raw RH 5.1 and is still running
kernel 2.0.35 so if there is a problem, it's not visible here. I'll
try this at home later...
