Yes. I noted that even when reading a single block, the block layer does a large read ahead request 
and the entire request times out block by block. I have been meaning to have a look at it and see 
what is required to get it to time out like SCSI/USB devices appear to (which is fail the entire 
request on error).
I'm also not sure there is not another issue lurking in there, but when it takes an hour to recover 
from a bad block read it does slow down testing somewhat ;p)
Regards,
Brad
