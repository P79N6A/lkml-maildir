No it is well defined it just isn't atomic.  But difference.
The thing is struct resource is accessed less often the file
offsets which are already 64bit.  Basically they are only
used during driver initialization.
So while I agree in general that 64bit values should be avoided
this is one of those places where we can productively use a
64bit value, on a 32bit machine.
To keep using 32bit kernels on the newer x86 machines at some
point this will even become a requirement as 64bit BAR will
actually have 64bit values placed in them.
