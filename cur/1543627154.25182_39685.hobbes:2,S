... OK, this is sounding familiar.  "usbfs" has some recently noted
bugs in its disconnect() routine.  That SpeedTouch driver seems to
be triggering them with regularity, though more often with usb-ohci.
The ksymoops info you sent is compatible with the bug being in
the usbfs code:  exactly what I'd expect such a BUG() to show.
I hate to send around untested patches, but I think the one I've
attached is at least in the right direction.  (Attachment, to avoid
mangling by mailers...)  It's an update of what I sent around late
last month to address someone's SpeedTouch oopsing with
usb-ohci (!) on 2.4.19-pre2, redone against 2.5.8-pre3, which
compiles.  I hope it doesn't create new oopses.
If it works for you, let us know ...
