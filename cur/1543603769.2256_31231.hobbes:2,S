3Com 3C985 series is supported by the AceNIC driver. The Intel cards
are only supported by an Intel provided driver which has license and

AceNIC basically covers the following cards: Alteon AceNIC, 3Com
3C985(B), NetGear GA620(T) and some cards from Farallon, DEC, HP & SGI
which I do not remember the model numbers of.
