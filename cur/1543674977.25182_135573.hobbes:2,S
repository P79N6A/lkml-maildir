How's this for a hack that makes it work a bit better?
# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
# Project Name: TSCT - The Silly C Tokenizer
# This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#	           ChangeSet	1.344   -> 1.345  
#	       pre-process.c	1.62    -> 1.63   
#	            Makefile	1.19    -> 1.20   
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 03/05/27	ryan@michonline.com	1.345
# This update (hopefully) will allow 'check' to find the appropriate, gcc-local 
# include headers (dependent, of course, upon the system it was built on)
# 
# It's still a hack, but at least it will work in a few more places.
# --------------------------------------------
