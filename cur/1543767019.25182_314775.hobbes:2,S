If you rmmod ide-cd in 2.6.12rc3 it issues a cache flush command to the
drive. Thankfully the bogus command this time is an ATAPI cache flush
not an ATA one so won't do any major harm but its still wrong as the
device is not a writer or packet mode capable (its a random DVD reader
holding a music CD)
