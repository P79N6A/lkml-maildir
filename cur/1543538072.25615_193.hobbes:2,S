Hi,
Since Alan is at LinuxTag, I've merged our latest VM patches against
2.2.17pre9 so people can test all of them together on different kind of
workloads. The "merged" patch includes:
- balance dirty patch which wakes up kflushd at "correct" times. (Andrea)
- GFP-race-fix-2.patch, fixes the free_before_allocate issue without
hurting other cases. (Andrea)  
- wait-dirty.patch, to avoid processes from waiting at dirty buffers while
there is freeable cache around. (me)
 - WRITEA patch, fixes the interactiveness problem under high IO. (me)
The patch can be found at
