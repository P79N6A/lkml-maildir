Subject: X (3.3.x), SMP, and 2.3.40 don't play nicely together
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have an ABIT BP6 SMP motherboard (the one with all the problems,
see linux-abit@geek.net for more info), running linux (debian unstable).
I have a matrox g400 max 32mb running at 1600 x 1200 x 32 x 85Hz.
I recently upgraded to XFree86 3.3.6 in the debian 3.3.6-3 package, while
running the 2.3.39 kernel.  All was good.
Then, I upgraded to 2.3.40.  Immediately afterward, the X server began
locking up after ~30-120 minutes of use, consistently.  I tried using 
the 3.3.6-2 and -3 debian packages, the 3.3.5 and 3.3.6 binaries off of 
xfree86.org, with the same results.  I could ssh in from my laptop, then
sometimes I could kill the X server; other times it was impossible to kill,
and I had to reboot, and other times it took 5 minutes to die.
This happened with the glx module for g400 enabled as well as disabled,
so that is not the problem.
I downgraded to kernel 2.3.39 and all was again good.
I didn't change any kernel settings between 2.3.39 and 2.3.40 compiles, AFAIK.
.config, bootup messages, etc. are included as mime attachments.
I'm pretty sure this is a kernel/x/smp thing, not a bp6 hardware thing,
but not totally sure.  There have certainly been a lot of problems with bp6
hardware, and X is implicated in many of the crashes.

I guess I should go back to 2.3.40 and strace the xserver sometime.
Thanks,
Ryan

# To customise the XKB settings to suit your keyboard, modify the
# lines below (which are the defaults).  For example, for a non-U.S.
# keyboard, you will probably want to use:
#    XkbModel    "pc102"
# If you have a US Microsoft Natural keyboard, you can use:
#    XkbModel    "microsoft"
#
# Then to change the language, change the Layout setting.
# For example, a german layout can be obtained with:
#    XkbLayout   "de"
# or:
#    XkbLayout   "de"
#    XkbVariant  "nodeadkeys"
#
# If you'd like to switch the positions of your capslock and
# control keys, use:
#    XkbOptions  "ctrl:swapcaps"
# These are the default XKB settings for XFree86
#    XkbRules    "xfree86"
#    XkbModel    "pc101"
#    XkbLayout   "us"
#    XkbVariant  ""
