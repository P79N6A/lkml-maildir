gpm support is on the way. Until it's available, you can use
'psmouse_noext=1' on the kernel or module command line to bring the
synaptics touchpad to standard PS/2 mouse mode. Then it'll work with gpm
without any changes. Don't expect advanced
multitap/scrolling/palmdetection, then, though.

Touchscreen is overlaid over a screen. The cursor follows the finger
position exactly. This is the sale for digitizers, except a cursor is
replaced by a pen. Touchpads are completely different - the finger
motion is relativized and then summed up again, so instead of the cursor
following the finger position, it moves in the direction the finger
moves.
As an example, imagine touching the touchscreen in the lower left corner and
moving it to the upper right. You end up with the cursor in the upper
right corner. Now tap the lower left corner again, and the cursor moves
there immediately. This is the behavior mousedev supports.
While with a touchpad, you'll first see the cursor moving towards the
upper right corner, but not reaching it. Now after tapping the lower
left corner again, the cursor stays in position and can be moved further
...
See the difference?
