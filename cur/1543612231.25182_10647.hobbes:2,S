OK, I've reloaded a new 0.10 version of the driver to my web site.  At 
this point, I'm calling this driver done until I hear otherwise.  If you 
have problems, or suspect you might have problems with this driver, or 
just want to make sure you *won't* have problems with this driver, test 
and speak now or possibly end up having to hack it yourself later ;-)
