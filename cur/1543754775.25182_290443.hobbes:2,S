Hi!
It happened for 3rd in a week now...
When problem happens, processes start to segfault, usually right
during startup. Programs that were loaded prior to problem usualy
works, and can be restarted. I also seen sendmail exec failing with
"no such file or directory" when it clearly was there. Reboot corrects
things, and filesystem (ext3) is not damaged.
Unfortunately I do not know how to reproduce it. I tried
parallel-building kernels for few hours and that worked okay. Swsusp
is not involved (but usb, bluetooth, acpi and sound may be).
Does anyone else see something similar?
