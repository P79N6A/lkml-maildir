Andy,
Sorry for lack of detailed explanation. What Prasanna said is correct.
The up()/down() orders are incorrect in arch/x86_64/kprobes.c file. kprobe_mutext is used to protect the free kprobe instruction slot list. arch_prepare_kprobe applies for a slot from the free list, and arch_remove_kprobe returns a slot to the free list. The incorrect up()/down() orders to operate on kprobe_mutex fail to protect the free list. If 2 threads try to get/return kprobe instruction slot at the same time, the free slot list might be broken, or a free slot might be applied by 2 threads. My patch fixes it.
