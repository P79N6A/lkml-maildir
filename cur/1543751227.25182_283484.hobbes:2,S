Subject: [rfc] i386/math-emu: __copy_to_user (and missing semicolon?)  [possible patch included]

Hi,
building a few 'make randconfig's I noticed this : 
  CC      arch/i386/math-emu/fpu_entry.o
include/asm/uaccess.h: In function `save_i387_soft':
arch/i386/math-emu/fpu_entry.c:745: warning: ignoring return value of `__copy_to_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
When I took a look I saw what looked like a missing semicolon and indeed 
the return value of __copy_to_user was being ignored (but a few lines from 
there another instance /was/ being tested).
That seems wrong.
I'll admit that I'm not familliar with the code in fpu_entry.c and I've 
only done a very cursory investigation to see if the patch below is 
actually correct (all I can really say is that it now compiles without 
warnings with the patch below).
Would something like this patch make sense? or am I missing something 
somewhere? Any comments are welcome.
