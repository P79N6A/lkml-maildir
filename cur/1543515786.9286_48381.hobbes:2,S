What you are saying ? OF COURSE 9X & NT HAS mount syscall. There are no
mount utility, it's right, but mount syscall is there. And it will return
to you is chkdsk/scandisk is needed (that is driver was not unmounted cleanly).
Just like in Linux. The only difference is that you can mount something only
on drive letter and not in directory...
