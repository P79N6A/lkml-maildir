Unless I overlooked it you did not mention what Linux version you use.
Recent versions are fine and work out of the box.
(These days 17 GB is small, and the more recent problems were caused
by the 34 GB limit, but also these disks should work fine now on
all recent kernels. In some cases a BIOS upgrade is required.)
