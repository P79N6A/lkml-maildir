Thanks for the help, but it was an error, not a warning.
It is caused by invalid code inside the body of the if(). The question
is not what is causing the error but why the compiler is evaluating the
body at all, given that the conditional is always false.
Apparently the body is evaluated prior to the optimizer getting a 
chance to nullify the whole construct.
