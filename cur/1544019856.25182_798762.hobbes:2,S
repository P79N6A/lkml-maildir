Precedence: bulk

This patchset contains the IMA integrity patches. Based on
comments on the mailing list, both the LIM ops registration,
which provides support for multiple integrity modules, and
template ops registration, which provides template support,
have been removed. As part of this change, the integrity 
hooks have been renamed to ima.
Other changes made since the last integrity posting, are based
on comments made by: Christoph Hellwig, Dave Hansen, Paul McKenney, 
Serge Hallyn, Matt Helsley, and Sukadev Bhattiprolu. Listed here  
are major changes. Additional changes are listed in the patch 
descriptions.
- added slab for integrity information(iint) associated with an inode
- added a local read and write count in iint
- lots of code refactoring 
- addressed locking, in general, and rcu-locking issues
- removed caching of measurement policy results
- cleanup of the policy parsing
New to the integrity patchset, based on Serge Hallyn and Dave
Hansen's suggestion, is a method to detect an imbalance between
the number of calls to ima_path_check() and ima_file_free(),
which could indicate that a file was accessed without first being
measured.
The integrity-tpm-internal-interface.patch will be posted separately
by Rajiv Andrade.
