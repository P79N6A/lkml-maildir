I have not changed the topic, you are still missing my point.
Let us get this small point out of the way:  I agree that GNU CSSC 
cannot read the BitKeeper ChangeSet file, which is a file critical for 
getting the "weave" correct.
But that point is not relevant to my thread of discussion.
Let us continue in the below paragraph...

I disagree with your translation.  Maybe this is the source of 
misunderstand.
To me, a "BK clone, read only for now" is vastly different from a "BK 
exporter".  The "for now" clearly implies that it will eventually 
attempt to be a full SCM.
Why do we need Yet Another Open Source SCM?
Why does Pavel not work on an existing open source SCM, to enable it to 
read/write BitKeeper files?
These are the key questions which bother me.
Why do they bother me?
The open source world does not need yet another project that is "not 
quite as good as BitKeeper."  The open source world needs something that 
  can do all that BitKeeper does, and more :)  A BK clone would be in a 
perpetual state of "not quite as good as BitKeeper".
