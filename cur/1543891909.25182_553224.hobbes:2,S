No (at least in BIOS setup screens). The closest is COM port setting 
(IRQ/DMA). This looks funny as I do not have COM interface anyway but may be 
docking station has.

Well, this is how code was written. There was no autodetection anyway, it used 
hardcoded builtin (unless overridden).

It does not work unfortunately:
Detected unconfigured Toshiba laptop with ALi ISA bridge SMSC IrDA chip, 
pre-configuring device.
Activated ALi 1533 ISA bridge port 0x02e8.
Activated ALi 1533 ISA bridge port 0x02f8.
pnp: Device 00:0a activated.
smsc_ircc_pnp_probe(): fir 0x100 sir 0x2e8 dma 1 irq 5
High: 0x11, Chip 0x0
smsc_ircc_present(), addr 0x0100 - no device found!
pnp: Device 00:0a disabled.
