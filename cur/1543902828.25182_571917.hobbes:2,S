Well with 4 PCI interrupts, it doesn't take that many PCI devices before
you must be sharing.  Of course it seems some higher end systems split
up the PCI bus in some way and run different IRQs from the APIC to
different slots.  I suspect that is how I see IRQ's of 177, 185, 193,
201, 209, etc on some systems.
If you have a server with an IO APIC then I suppose you have a rather
good chance of avoiding shared IRQs for the most part.
