the reason is that i initially only had the chunk above to protect 
against lockdep recursion within vprintk() - it grew the 'outer' 
lockdep_off()/on() protection only later on. But that lockdep_off() made 
the release_console_sem() within vprintk() always happen under the 
lockdep_internal() condition, causing your bug.
so the right solution is your patch: to remove the inner protection 
against recursion here - the outer one is enough.
Andrew, could we use the patch below - it also removes a now stale 
comment. Also for -stable review i think.

Subject: lockdep: fix printk recursion logic
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
bug reported and fixed by Tilman Schmidt <tilman@imap.cc>: if
lockdep is enabled then log messages make it to /var/log/messages
belatedly. The reason is a missed wakeup of klogd.
initially there was only a lockdep_internal() protection against
lockdep recursion within vprintk() - it grew the 'outer'
lockdep_off()/on() protection only later on. But that lockdep_off() made
the release_console_sem() within vprintk() always happen under the
lockdep_internal() condition, causing the bug.
the right solution to remove the inner protection against
recursion here - the outer one is enough.
