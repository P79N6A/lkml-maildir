Thanks for the offer!
I don't have any parisc hardware. If -mm kernels are tested well with
parisc, I'd be happy to leave it in your guys' hands since I've never
used parisc and the patches seem to work (with the bug fix for 32bits
boxes).
I'd like to try if there are not people who try -mm kernels with
parisc or a bug that I can't fix easily will be found.
Thanks,
