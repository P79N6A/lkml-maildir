No reference counts reported to module subsystem at all, so, you can 
rmmod a module at any time, even if the interface is up and running.
Even though net devices are independently refcounted and internally 
consistent, I have no idea if the module's code is refcounted elsewhere 
or not.  So, I hope it's safe...
