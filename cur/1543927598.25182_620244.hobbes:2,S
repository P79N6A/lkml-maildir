Hi Pierre,
Thanks for explaining.
I guess then I have a crappy SDIO card that needs the "voodoo" bit set
for correct operation. There are other registers close to the START
ADDRESS so it is a FIFO, but the Incrementing Address flag is needed to
read from and write to the FIFO correctly.
Regards,
Dean.

I.e. the only address it cares about is the start address and hence needs it to be the same for each transaction. This kind of blatant disregard for the SDIO register design is of course not what sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() was designed for, and probably never will be.

If it doesn't then it isn't following the register interface design of SDIO (having the "increase address" bit would just be silly if the arguments were arbitrary tokens and not part of a consistent address space).
