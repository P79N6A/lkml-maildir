I've already tested that (as I said somewhere in the bugzilla so
it probably got lost somehow :-) ): It doesn't solve the booting
problem, and I really don't have an idea what it does, nor does
it output any debug code. So I left it at: doesn't fix ;-).
Anyway: on to the ide_setup tracking....
(I've noticed that the notifier of this problem als has idebus=66
or something similar, so that explains in his case the
early call to ide_setup.)
