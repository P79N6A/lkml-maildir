What a performance nightmare.  Updating a user space database every time 
a file changes --- let's move to a micro-kernel architecture for all of 
the kernel the same day.....;-)
Not to mention that SQL is utterly unsuited for semi-structured data 
queries (what people store in filesystems is semi-structured data), and 
would only be effective for those fields that you require every file to 
have.

How about you send him a patch that removes all of that networking stuff 
from the kernel and puts it into user space where it belongs.;-)  There 
was this Windows user on Slashdot some time ago who claimed that it 
wasn't just the browser that should be unbundled from the kernel, the 
whole networking stack was unfairly bundled and locked out the companies 
that used to provide DOS with networking stacks (the user didn't have in 
mind patching the windows kernel and recompiling, he really thought it 
should all be in user space).  Your kind of fellow.....
It is true that there are many features, such as an automatic text 
indexer, that belong in user space, but the basic indexes (aka 
directories) and index traversal code belong in the kernel.
