Wow!! Thats weird. Before you do this try turning off accel support inside 
matroxfb. It could be that the console code is executing a accel command
while GLX is running. To turn off accel support in matroxfb run 
fbset -noaccel. 
If you don't have this program you can get it at
http://www.linux-fbdev.org
. Just follow the link for fbdev utilities.
