Subject: [patch 1/1] uml: fix oops related to exception table [for 2.6.12, urgent]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In short: avoid that the kernel oopses during the extable sorting, as it can
do now, because the extable is in the readonly section of the binary.
From Jeff: The exception table turned RO in 2.6.11-rc3-mm1 for some reason.
Moving it causes it to land in the writable data section of the binary.
From Paolo: This patch fixes a oops on startup, which can be easily triggered
by compiling with CONFIG_MODE_TT disabled, and STATIC_LINK either disabled or
enabled. The resulting kernel will always Oops on startup, after printing this
simple output:
Checking for /proc/mm...found
Checking for the skas3 patch in the host...found
Checking PROT_EXEC mmap in /tmp...OK
Debugging shows that it's a SIGSEGV during the extable sorting, which is
caused by the fact that the table is in the read-only section of the binary.
The oops is a 2.6.11-bk7 (more or less) regression, which I already reported
on uml-devel. In fact, the original patch had already been totally dropped
because it seemed useless. Also, I don't know why the moved section becomes
writable, actually. And on i386 the current layout is like the one we have
*before* this patch. Still, it does fix the problem for me.
I've verified, by binary search on the BitKeeper repository (synced up as of
2.6.12-rc2), starting from the range 2.6.11-2.6.12-rc1, that this bug shows up
on BitKeeper revisions in the range [@1.1994.11.168,+inf), i.e. starting from
this:
[PATCH] lib/sort: Replace insertion sort in exception tables
Since UML does not use the exception table, it's likely that insertion sort
didn't happen to write anything on the table.
