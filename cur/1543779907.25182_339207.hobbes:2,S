there is a definite requirement for the kernel to expose SOME things to
userspace. Well for SOMETHING to expose them. Right now most distros
ship a hacked up version of the kernel headers (eg removed of all the
kernel specific stuff and all the gpl inline code etc). A good part of
making such an external project possible is to make a clean separation
between userspace shared stuff and pure kernel internals.
