There has to be at least 1 synchronize_rcu() or equivalent in the 
unregister_netdev() path.  I suspect the easiest way to fix it might be to 
use call_rcu() to actually free the network device, as anything else will 
limit performance of single threaded teardown (ie, when an l2tp daemon 
gets terminated via kill -9).  This means an API change that exposes 
rcu for unregister_netdev().
