Hi,
I recently upgraded my Thinkpad with 20GB HDD, and installed Redhat 7.1
with kernel version 2.4.2-2. After this, I am facing a strange problem
booting
under Linux. BTW, my machine also has Windows :) 
Whenever I am in Linux, and _softboot_ the system by choosing Linux at the
lilo prompt, the boot process stops with the following message.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXT2-fs: unable to read superblock
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=03:06, iso_blknum=16,block=32
Kernel panic: Unable to mount root fs on 03:06
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surprisingly, whenever I _hardboot_ the system and choose Linux at the
lilo
the system boots normally without any problem.
Can you help me out with this problem ?
Regards,
M.C.Reddy.
