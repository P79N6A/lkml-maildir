Good point. I forget that we just test "uptodate", but then always sleep 
on "locked".

I'd agree, except something clearly has changed ;^)

jbd hasn't changed since 2.6.20, and the ext3 changes are mostly 
things like const'ness fixes. And others were things like changing 
"journal_current_handle()" into "ext3_journal_current_handle()", which 
looked exciting considering that the hung processes were waiting for the 
journal, but the fact is, that's just an inline function that just calls 
the old function, so..
But interestingly, there *is* a "EA block reference count racing fix" 
that does move a lock_buffer()/unlock_buffer() to cover a bigger area. It 
looks "obviously correct", but maybe there's a deadlock possibility there 
with ext3_forget() or something?
