Agreed, but I can still do better with a userspace solution.
Under the one-file-per-article scheme, I have to make at least three
system calls to write an article (open(), write(), close()). Reading a
file is basically the same thing. (You can use mmap() to get around some
performance issues, but many people avoid it for portability reasons.)
Under a scheme with one large file, and the server managing it, I have
two: lseek() and read/write() (open() and close() are done at
initialization and shutdown).
While I don't argue that reiserfs would be a fantastic thing to have (mail
spools, for example, would benefit greatly from it), I just don't see it
as the next big way to do news.
