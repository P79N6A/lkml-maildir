Hi Rafael,
what part of this is not suitable for swsusp? All we do is just use flat physical mode
for IPI processing. The only difference is moving from logical flat mode to using
flat physical mode.
Have you tested swsusp with CONFIG_GENERICARCH and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y ?
It might help to explain why this would break your swsusp with SMP work?
