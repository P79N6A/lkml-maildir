It looks like you are limiting the number of CPUs to sizeof(long).
Must you? Using "%lx" would be better in any case. Considering that
you may outgrow the format, maybe this info doesn't belong in the
/proc/*/stat files at all. For "ps" usage, a simple flag to indicate
if the process is locked to a CPU would be OK. There are 3 cases
of interest:
1. can run on all CPUs
2. can run on only the currently used CPU
3. can run on some subset of the available CPUs
(defined sanely for 1-CPU and 2-CPU systems of course)
