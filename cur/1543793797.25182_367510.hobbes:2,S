Hello Pekka, 
Ok , I will revert previous fix and apply the new patch you had sent.
Also I can confirm that previous patch indeed doesn't fix the problem.
Anyway please look through trace.3 perhaps you will find anything
useful ;)
Any bits to turn on for debugging when loading module (I have now 
debug=0x10000, to see f/w loading/restart problems ...).
I am off to compile new kernel ...
Z.
