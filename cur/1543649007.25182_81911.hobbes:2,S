Why do you need three levels of cleaning?
In other words what is it that make clean failed to clean in your case.
I know that we always used to say: make mrproper can cure everything.
But make clean starts to get the power of make mrproper.
It makes sense to kill one of them, but make help needs an update though.
You could argue if distclean=mrproper or mrproper=clean.
