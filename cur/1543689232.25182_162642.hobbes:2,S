How'd that get capitalized? It's not an acronym.
At any rate, fork()'s relevance to performance is not being measured
in any context remotely resembling real usage cases, e.g. forking
servers. There are other problems with kernel compiles, for instance,
internally limited parallelism, and a relatively highly constrained
userspace component which is impossible to increase the concurrency of.
