Um, the current hotplug scripts, and my diethotplug program already do
this.  Why write another user program to do this?  What problem are you
trying to solve?

The support hardware ids are already in the source code, and can be
easily extracted, that is what depmod(8) does to build the modules.*map
files.  See the linux-hotplug documentation at
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net/
 and this article:
	
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5604
on how all of this works.  I need to move that article into the
Documentation/DocBook directory someday soon...
driverfs documentation could be retrieved with the DEVICE_ATTR macro, if
we _really_ throught this would be useful.
thanks,
