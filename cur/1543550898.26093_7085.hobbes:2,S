linux-raid is better for RAID problems.

Which tells us it's not a bug in the RAID layer.

I bet you can make your system lock up with the buslogic card just by doing
normal non-RAID disk I/O as well.  Try copying files between the disks, or
something else that's disk intensive.
I don't know about special issues with the buslogic card and the kernel you're
running.  It could be a driver problem, a card problem, or perhaps a wiring
problem (this can sometimes kill the kernel because some drivers error-handling
suck) or a disk problem (if the reconstruction halts at the exact same place
every time this could be likely).
