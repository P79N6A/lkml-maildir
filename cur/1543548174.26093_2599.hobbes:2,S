The traces look more like a very primitive DDoS tool to be honest. stream is
pretty BSD specific though hit hard enough it works on any box. The thing
about stream is you can make it about 5 times more effective with tiny changes
The RST defence works well for most DDoS based rst causing attacks. It works
well because the average attacker is using tools not writing them
