How about, "look mommy, I'm still acting like
a file with streams is a directory!"
Would it make sense for a more traditional file attribute,
lets say "sticky" for instace, to exist independant of a
file? Why does it make sense for an extended attribute to?
It doesn't. Why does it then make sense for generalized
extended attributes -- named streams -- to exist independant
of files?
