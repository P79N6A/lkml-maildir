Yeah, the user sets policy, devfs follows that policy.

I don't understand what you mean. Why can't it help with naming?

devfs has the userspace. devfsd would be responsible for seeing that a
new device got connected, obtaining information useful to naming it,
and then naming it.
I have the feeling that we are on different wavelengths here.
