So.. your use case is what? If an AA user asked you to protect his mail 
from his browser I'm sure you'd truthfully answer "no, we can't do that 
but we can protect the path to your mail from your browser".. I think 
not. One need only look at the wonderful marketing literature for AA to 
see what you are telling people it can do, and your above statement 
isn't consistent with that, sorry.
