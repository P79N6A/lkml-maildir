   :) cool, porky talks with timestamps just fine now, as does ftp.x.org.
   Tcpdump still says truncated-ip, but the packet sequence is the same
   as with no timestamps and there's no timeout.
It says truncated IP because the TCP headers went past the default
tcpdump per-packet capture size, maybe, try giving "-s 128" to tcpdump
to see if that goes away.
Andrea, I'm almost certainly going to apply your patch.  Nice
spotting.
Later,
