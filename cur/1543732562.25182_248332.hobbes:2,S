We never add patches that duplicate existing functionality just to
make it somehow "easier" for the user.  That's a job for scripts
and good tools, that make use of existing kernel facilities.
Alan is saying you can hide whatever complexity you claim exists via
tools, without any kernel modifications.  If you continue to ignore
that part of the discussion, it seems likely we will just the same
ignore your patch.
I, frankly, see no reason at all to even remotely consider your patch.
Furthermore, you'll get more discussion by bringing this up in the proper
place to propose such networking changes (netdev@oss.sgi.com).
