It looks like the patch from Olaf Hering <olh@suse.de>
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0408.0/0792.html
causes the problem.
A patch from Andrea Arcangeli <andrea@novell.com>
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0409.3/1515.html
corrects the problem.
It looks like the Linus tree only has Olaf's patch.
Andrew's tree (mm) has Andrea's patch.
