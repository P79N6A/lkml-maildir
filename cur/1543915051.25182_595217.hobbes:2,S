On which legal grounds do you base this statement?
And if you choose the GPL the code you distribute will be under the GPL 
*only* forever [1], so what value would be in shipping terms that are 
void?
And if the author intended to have the BSD licence text kept intact when 
his code gets incorporated into GPL'ed code, why didn't he simply make 
his code BSD-only? In fact the only difference between BSD-only code and 
BSD/GPL dual-licenced code is that you can't remove the BSD licence text 
for the former when incorporating it into GPL'ed code...

If anything can be called relicencing, then the act of choosing one of 
the licence. And this happens one level above the actual licences, and 
the licence texts don't matter for this act.

You confuse two completely different situations.
The SFLC talks about how to incorporate *not* dual-licenced
BSD-only code into GPL'ed code.

It's not about lazyness of BSD developers, many people who consider the 
BSD licence more free than the GPL argue that the advantage of the BSD 
licence is that it does not require you to give back.
Something is wrong if your licence text clearly states that you do not 
require getting anything back but you then argue on moral grounds that
something has to be given back.
The majority of Linux developers might have never read the complete GPL 
text, and the same might be true for some licence expressing the 
intentions of the OpenBSD developers. But it would document in a legal 
binding way the intentions of the OpenBSD developers.

I don't know the background of this one, but besides the already 
expressed point that it wouldn't bring you much for technical reasons
(the Linux code will quickly switch to Linux conventions), there might
be better ways for starting a collaboration than Theo's rants.

As said above, keeping void terms neither makes sense, nor does there 
seem to be any legal requirement.
