Hmm... fair enough.  start_this_handle (which is called eventually
from ext3_dirty_inode) seems to wait for a few different things, and I
jumped to some conclusions.

No, that was tried.

Uhmmm... not sure what you are thinking.
I guess we could teach vm.dirty_ratio to take a floating point number
(but does sysctl understand that?) so we could set it to 0.01 or
similar, but that is missing the point in a way.  We don't really want
to set a small ratio.  We want to set a small maximum number.
It could make lots of sense to have two numbers.  A ratio that wins on
a small memory machine and a fixed number that wins on a large memory
machine.  Different trade offs are more significant in the different
cases.

I didn't add a fixed limit for dirty_background_ratio as it seemed
reasonable to assume that (dirty_background_ratio / dirty_ratio) was a
meaningful value, and just multiplied the final 'dirty' figure by this
ration to get the 'background' figure.

I don't think so.  You would need to have blindingly fast storage
before there would be any interest in vm_dirty_kb getting anything
close to t*bytes.  But I guess we can make it 'unsigned long' if it
helps.
