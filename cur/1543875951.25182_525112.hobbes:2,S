Try changing the order of the console= parameters:
    kernel ... console=ttyS1,96008N1 console=tty0
Some time ago I understood what this does. Nowadays I can only remember
that this makes both the serial console and directly attached
screen/keyboard console work most of the time. FWIW, tty0 becomes the
so-called "preferred console".
