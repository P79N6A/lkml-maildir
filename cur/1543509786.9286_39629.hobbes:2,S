Hello!
> (disabled) cipcb0's address.
"ifconfig xxx down" does _not_ disable the interface, it shutdowns
driver. If "ifconfig xxx" shows something, the interface is present,
all the addresses configured on it are "deprecated", but they are still
valid addresses of this host.
To disable interface completely you have to remove its addresses.
