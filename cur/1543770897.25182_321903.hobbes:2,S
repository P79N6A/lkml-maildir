The more I look at Ingo's RT patch the more I see a cleanup. It is the old
maybe-preemptive way which is a mess. There is so much the kernel
developer have to think off wrt. locking. Too many kind of contexts,
per cpu variables, miriads of locking types. When I started to look at it
I thought: What a mess. 
PREEMPT_RT basicly boils it down to: everything are threads, the only way
to protect data is to use a mutex or use RCU. In short: Linux with
PREEMPT_RT is much easier to understand and develop than with !PREEMPT_RT.
