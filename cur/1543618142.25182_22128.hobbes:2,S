Daniel just reiterated it, but I suspect we better multitask a mix of
tasks.  I/O-bound tasks that are woken can be run quicker and thus
throughput increases.
I'm not trying to tout preempt-kernel as a throughput solution.  I think
it is a neat and promising side-note to the patch, and one that
benchmarks are correlating.  Ignore it as a statistical error and
consider throughput untouched if you want.
