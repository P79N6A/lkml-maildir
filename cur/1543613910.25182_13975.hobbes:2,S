Agree. However, put your business hat for a minute. We want increased
market share for linux and a lot of us, you included, live by it. 
If aio, the proposed implementation or some other, can provide an
adequate performance boost for Java (yet to be seen), that at least 
allows the marketing folks one more argument to draw users to linux. 
Do think the trade mags etc don't watch what we do? A demonstrable
advantage in Java performance is marketable and beneficial to all.
