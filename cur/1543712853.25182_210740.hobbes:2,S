SysRq not working too? Look into interrupt handler of this driver.
Is there any potentially-endless loops? Modify them to have
some timeout, make them printk out loud if timeout triggers.

Do parallel reads with dd. Does it happen? Do the same with DMA off.
Does it happen now? Same with writes. etc.
You may need to serialize channel usage in driver code if it indeed
happens when both channels are working at the same time.
