I do not think I like this.  SMP, kernel preemption, and high memory
support are the three most fundamental choices one makes during
configuration.
They should be out in the open, in the beginning, in a well-labeled
category.  They only issue I see is "processor options" should be
renamed "core options" or whatever.  But that is trivial.
