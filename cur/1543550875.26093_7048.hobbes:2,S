I think it's related to the drive type in some way.  What we are seeing
is the CD burner hang on the first write to track 0.  Once it starts
burning, it seems to work fine, and we have even got some clean burns
at speed=4, however, when it's set this way, we occasionally see cdrecord
hang when it attempts to write the first track of a CD.  It ruins the 
CD in the burner, BTW when this happens.  I also see an I/O error message
from the ide-scsi driver about a timeout and data error 
(but I did not write it down -- sorry).  
I will burn some more CD's today, and will try to get more info.  Config 
is:
in lilo.conf:
append "hdd=ide-scsi"
and the CDROM device is mapped to:
/dev/scd0
and I load the ide-scsi module:
insmod ide-scsi
and:
cdrecord -scanbus.
Then we use the system to burn CD's all day.
