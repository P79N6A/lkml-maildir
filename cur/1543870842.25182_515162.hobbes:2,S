Oh.  Well, yes, if the user elected to instruct the backup program to
invalidate both its input files and its output files and if it's a full
dump, you end up with nothing in pagecache.  Possibly a more sensible
setting would be to invalidate only the output.
But having some batch program come in from the side and perform a bulk read
of your present working set isn't very common.

That's quite wrong.  It is useful for a great number of well-known problem
scenarios, all of which are *already "specialized situations".  It's *you*
who is chasing down the 1% scenarios and portraying them as general problems.
Backups only happen once in 24 hours, for example.

I don't know how much benefit it will provide for the updatedb problem - I
expect it'll help sometimes.  otoh maybe it'll worsen the existing slab internal
fragmentation problem, dunno.
But the other scenarios it solves completely and optimally.
