I don't think it can. There is a main function surrounded by #ifdef
UNITTEST which might once have worked but now there is far too much
kernel gunk in there (as you might expect).
If I can work up the enthusiasm I might break out the core algorithm
into a separate file that can be used in both the kernel and userspace.
