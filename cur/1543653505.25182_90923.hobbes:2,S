You never convinced me. Maybe we ever meet and can talk..
In the meantime:
Yesterday or so I built versions of 2.5.48 with 32-bit and 64-bit dev_t.
The code is full of conversions dev_t -> int -> dev_t -> int.
Ugly. I gave the mknod method in struct inode_operations type
	int (*mknod) (struct inode *,struct dentry *,int,dev_t);
thus avoiding much conversion.
Do you have objections?
