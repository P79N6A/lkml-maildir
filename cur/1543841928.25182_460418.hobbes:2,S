I'd like to have panic blink and also be able to Shft-Up to previous 
console screens.  
If possible, kill the console blank timer too?  (dunno if you have).
Example: Oops screen on 2.4 recently I paged up to where the fault 
started, the screen blanker kicked in while I was hand copying info 
and wiped previous screens :(  Caused significant delay in working 
out what the issue was (slackware-10.2 2.4.33.1 glibc nptl boo-boo).
Is it safe / easy to do on oops/panic?
Grant.
