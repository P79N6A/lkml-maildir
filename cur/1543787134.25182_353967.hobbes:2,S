Actually I'm not so sure that they are all needed.  I only looked
at the very first one in the patch which is in in_dev_get().  That
one certainly isn't necessary because the old value of ip_ptr
is valid as long as the reference count does not hit zero.
The later is guaranteed by the increment in in_dev_get().
Because the pervasiveness of reference counting in the network stack,
I believe that we should scrutinise the other bits in the patch too
to make sure that they are all needed.
In general, using rcu_dereference/rcu_assign_pointer does not
guarantee correct code.  We really need to look at each case
individually.
Cheers,
