The two clear bug fix patches are refcount and flush order.
refcnt could be moved earlier; flush order would be quite painful
because there are quite a lot of patches dependent on it.
I could move ref count earlier, but I would prefer not to because
of the significant work it would be for me. 
Since it is all already bisectable I'm also not sure what debugging
advantages the reordering would be. 
It's already bisectable (I have not booted all immediate steps,
but several of them and I believe all compile) and in small pieces for that.
If it's really broken it would need to be reverted and then the ref count 
stuff would go too.  But I hope that won't be needed. 
And even losing the reference count fixes wouldn't be catastrophic -- in the
worst case you lose some minor performance because kernel mappings are 
unnecessarily split to 4K pages, but it's not a correctness fix. 
So while the reordering would be possible, it would imho not
bring very much advantages and I must admit I'm not too motivated
to do another time-consuming reordering for a relatively weak reason.  
If it was a 5 patch series I would probably not complain too much
about this, but it's 25+ patches.

That's a completely different area really. Most of the PAT code
has nothing to do with clear_page_attr(). Please think that through
again after reading both patchkits.
As far as I can see making it wait for PAT would mean delaying
it for a longer time which would be a pity.

There are actual a lot more performance features in there (self snoop,
minimal TLB flushing some other stuff). Most of it is related to 
that in fact.

That's already at the end.

That's already the case.
