Yes, I certainly encountered the problem during testing eCryptfs on -mm,
and found Nick Piggin's new aops patchset lacks changes for eCryptfs.

OK, I understand the reason and your plan.  Thanks for letting me know!
As you say, I honestly felt that it's a difficult task to write
stackable filesystems using low level operations.
It's good idea to replace them with the vfs functions.
So, how long does it take for the conversion, do you think?
Though I'm currenty focussing on eCryptfs in mainline,
I'd like to shift my focus to the new one if it's preferable.
