What are all the new memory "hogs" in 2.2.x?  I figure the directory cache
and the kernel mode NFS server are the biggest culprits, but are there any
others?  Unfortunately there is not much that I can do about the directory
cache but what else can be left off of a 2.2.x kernel compile.  As it stands
now this situation puts alot of my single purpose servers at a delema;
upgrade to bigger, badder systems or forgo support for some of the new
useful goodies such as support for more hardware and security features
(firewalling stuff).  Hopefully I can trim 2.2.x down enougth to make all
those PS/2's I keep running into useful again.
