Print the loaded modules, and their licenses, one per line?
"Microsoft-EULA-v666" is a bit confusing if you don't know where it came
from.
Also, I see "GPL".  With Linus' and Alan's declarations last year,
shouldn't it be:
  GPL version 2 only
  GPL version 2 (or, at your option, any later version)
;-) no that's not a serious suggestion.
