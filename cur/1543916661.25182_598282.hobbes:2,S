I realise there is no problem, in a technical sense.  But it strikes me as
more aesthetic to make related syscalls numerically contiguous.  Thus, we
see such as the following in the kernel source
#define __NR_epoll_create       254
#define __NR_epoll_ctl          255
#define __NR_epoll_wait         256
and
#define __NR_timer_create       259
#define __NR_timer_settime      (__NR_timer_create+1)
#define __NR_timer_gettime      (__NR_timer_create+2)
#define __NR_timer_getoverrun   (__NR_timer_create+3)
#define __NR_timer_delete       (__NR_timer_create+4)
and
#define __NR_inotify_init       291
#define __NR_inotify_add_watch  292
#define __NR_inotify_rm_watch   293

Well, in the past it seems they do get filled soon enough though.  There's
fair odds that you'll be the one to fill it with the next syscall you write
;-).
Cheers,
Michael
