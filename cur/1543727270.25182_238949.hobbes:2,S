I can easily imagine this sort of real-life application.  Anything that 
generate real-time data, such as sound or video for immediate playback 
will use some continous fraction of cpu, depending on how much data and 
how fast the cpu happens to be.   A scheduler with such
a problem will now and then cause trouble when some processor needs just the
"wrong" percentage of its capacity to run the task(s). 
Consider someone playing several video files until he exceeds the 
capacity of the machine. Video skipping frames is then ok, a frozen UI 
is not.  Or consider a multiuser machine running several games.  Or even 
a parallell kernel compile when the source isn't cached. The compiler(s) 
will work for a while, wait for disk for a while, work for a while . . .
2.6.8-rc2-mm2 seems to work fine for me right now, but I hope there will 
be solutions for this sort of problem.
