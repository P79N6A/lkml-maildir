Are you sure you've got this right?  I thought that the shmid_kernel
struct protects shm_nattch with a local (per structure) lock which is
embedded in kern_ipc_perm.  Did you find shm_nattch changes w/out
shm_lock/shm_unlock around it?  I believe shm_ids.sem is protecting the
id allocation, not per object data such as shm_nattch.
thanks,
