The patch doesn't look like too much of a hack, pretty clean
implementation in support of a hot-swap of an adapter using ACPI hooks.
It is not specific to x86 platforms. I'd prefer that it looked more like
a suspend/resume interface rather than a raw ACPI event.
There needs to be a power management interface to SCSI and to the LLD's
in support of hot-swap of PCI attached devices. Otherwise you are asking
for the driver to be blindsided on any platform that supports this
necessary service feature.
