Read 
  man mdadm
the section on "CREATE MODE", the last paragraph before the "General
Management options" are listed.  Be sure that you have mdadm 1.4.0 or
later.

[ the paragraph reads:
       When creating a RAID5 array, mdadm will automatically create a degraded
       array  with  an  extra spare drive.  This is because building the spare
       into a degraded array is in general faster than resyncing the parity on
       a  non-degraded, but not clean, array.  This feature can be over-ridden
       with the --force option.
if you remove the "-I" that really shoudn't be there... :-(
