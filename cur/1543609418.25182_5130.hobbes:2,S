connection tracking keeps all TCP conntrack entries for 120 seconds after
completion of FIN <-> FIN closedown.  This is the TIME_WAIT state of the
tcp protocol.
Maybe the linux tcp stack doesn't wait for 120 seconds, or some other 
condition in the tcp stack makes the sockets disappear from the netstat -t
list.
