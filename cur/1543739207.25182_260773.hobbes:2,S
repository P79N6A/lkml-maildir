Yep, called on module removal.
Cheers,

Name: Avoid warning on CONNTRACK_STAT_INC in death_by_timeout()
Status: Trivial
Signed-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>
Module removal can call death_by_timeout() manually, which isn't in
softirq context, so the CONNTRACK_STAT_INC() call there (which assumes
preempt disabled) can give a warning.  Of course, the warning here is
spurious, but the simplest workaround is to call CONNTRACK_STAT_INC()
inside the lock.
