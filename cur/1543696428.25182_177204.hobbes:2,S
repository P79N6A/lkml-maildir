I don't want to tie io prioritites to cpu priorities, that's a design
decision.

ioprio == 0 means idle IO. It follows from that that you can risk
infinite starvation if other io is happening. Otherwise it would not be
idle io :-)
CFQ doesn't assign request deadlines. That would be another way of
handling starvation.
