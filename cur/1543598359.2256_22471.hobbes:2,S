I was under the impression that the current LinuxThread library does use 
CLONE_THREAD, and I know of at least one project under way that's also 
using it (the NGPT pthread library).  The getpid() system call already 
returns tgid instead of pid.  I'm also looking into what's involved in 
making tgid more robust.
