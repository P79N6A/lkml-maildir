No it did not. It has never been a safe assumption. Even my old PC110
does APM non-linux assisted shifts between 8 16 and 33Mhz. In addition
there are boxes with dual CPU's and different multipliers - dual 
300/450's were not uncommon.
And thats before we even mention such things at hyped-threading.
