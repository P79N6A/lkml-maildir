the wait list can grow only as long as the max # of RT tasks is. Sorted 
lists become 'O(1)' if we added some code that globally limits the 
number of RT tasks to say 50. E.g. /proc/sys/kernel/max_nr_RT_tasks. A 
user can override it if he needs more RT tasks. There can be an 
arbitrary number of SCHED_OTHER tasks.
(note that on Linux there is a RAM-dependent 'max # of tasks' ulimit 
which is never 'infinity', so theoretically the sorted lists are "O(1)" 
too. But this is nitpicking.)

yes, it's supposed to be used for user-space PI too. What do you mean by 
'completely bounded'. Do you consider the current worst-case O(100) 
property of plists a 'completely bounded' solution?
i dont think fusyn's should be made available to non-RT tasks. If this 
restriction is preserved then fusyn's would become O(max_nr_RT_tasks) 
too.
