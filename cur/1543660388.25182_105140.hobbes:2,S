Yes, and unfortunately it does this by default.  The idea of CONFIG_MCA_LEGACY 
was to have legacy drivers unable to compile like this.  However, it seems 
that most people who will be trying this don't get the CONFIG_MCA_LEGACY set.
When the option was added, I couldn't come up with a useful scheme to make the 
legacy (which is almost all MCA drivers) require CONFIG_MCA_LEGACY (there's a 
kernel bug about this too).
However, looking through the source, the 3c509 driver is broken anyway for MCA 
(done by the eisa sysfs patches), so I think I can probably just add the extra 
pieces to convert it to the new sysfs MCA API.
