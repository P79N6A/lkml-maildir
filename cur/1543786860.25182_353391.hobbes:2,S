Ok. After all this discussion looks like time to drop the patch. The
architectures which need page_size, they can modify vmlinux.ld.S to 
embed the information in vmlinux. 
Crash can do without pointer to crashing cpu's task_struct as well
(Though it is more work on crash's part). At the same time this information
can not possibly be captured in kernel reliably after the crash.
Identifying crashing cpu is important. Empty NT_KDUMPINFO would have done
the job but use of variables will avoid defining ABI. For the time being
crashing_cpu will do the job. Ofcourse this code is not robust enough to
handle stack overflow situations and that shall have to be taken care of. 
Andrew, Could you please drop this patch from -mm.
