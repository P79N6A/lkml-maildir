hi Stolle, Martin (KIV),
SMK> I installed 2.4.17-rmap-11c and later 2.4.17-rmap-12a on my
SMK> 2-CPU-Pentium-III
SMK> and on one of my 4-CPU-Xeon-III's, and since then, the machine isn't
SMK> swapping any
SMK> longer.
SMK> Thanks to you and Rik van Riels!
SMK> I would like if Rik's kernel patches would go into standard.
SMK> They are really well!
I can really agree to those statements. It also seems that my
harddrives are more quiet and faster, because the heavy swap-accesses
of the official 2.4.17 are gone.
(It's now even possible to compile a 2.4.17 with -j2 on a SMP system with 64MB
without swap-usage! Yes, it's a lower end system :)
Marcelo: I recommend the rmap12a-patch for the official stable tree. Please
have a look at rmap12a!
