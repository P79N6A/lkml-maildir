I would, but Linus will not accept it. I asked about this about a 
month ago, because I am interested in helping out with this. But 
Linus does not want any mechanism in the kernel that will enable 
anyone to build binary-only drivers, regardless of whether than 
mechanism will help solve compatibility problems with Open Source 
binary portable drivers.
Hence if the Linux kernel people are not interested in accepting my 
contributions, then why the hell should I go about implementing them? 
Instead I will stick to making the small modifications we need for 
our products, and forget about helping Linux become a better OS.
