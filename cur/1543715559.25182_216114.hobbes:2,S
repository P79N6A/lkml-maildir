ketchup is a script that automatically patches between kernel
versions, downloading and caching patches as needed, and automatically
determining the latest versions of several trees. Available at:
 
http://selenic.com/ketchup/ketchup-0.7
New in this version by popular demand:
- handles empty directories:
  if you run ketchup in an empty directory, it'll search its cache for
  a tarball nearest to the version specified and unpack that before
  patching, downloading a new tarball if none is available
- uses wget if available, with resume support
- uses gpg if available (disable with -G)
- archive, kernel-url, and work directory command line parameters
- cleaned up option parsing
- elimination of more Python 2.3isms (tested against 2.1)
- support for Martin Bligh's -mjb tree
Example usage:
 $ ketchup 2.6-mm
 2.6.3-rc1-mm1 -> 2.6.5-mm4
