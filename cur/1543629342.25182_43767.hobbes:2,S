Sorry for my ignorance Marcelo,
but why don't we see the "outstanding" VM fixes even if the -19 cycle is so 
long, then?
So we see posts like "...hurray, the O(1)-scheduler is so much faster..." and 
"...-jam6, too..." (including the spiltted vm33), etc.
All this numbers are known for months.
Do you think the pending VM stuff goes into -20, at least?
Thanks,
	Dieter
