Okay, now, when I can boot the kernel (read some of the other posts in
this thread: I have got the booting working), I have found out that the
modules, which have unresolved symbols, can't be loaded within the
kernel. So far, so good. These unresolved symbols. Are they kernel
errors or are the errors on my side? What can *I* do to fix it, besides
messing with the kernel code? Thanks.
