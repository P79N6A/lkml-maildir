Hello.
Would you update the "dive into the archive" link at 
http://lkml.org/
to point to 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/
 ?
Also, I think the entry
"penguin-kernel@i-love ... [2.6.25-rc5-mm1] BUG() at mnt_want_write()."
appears by error in the "Hottest messages" list.
Would you remove the entry from "Hottest messages" list?
Regards.
