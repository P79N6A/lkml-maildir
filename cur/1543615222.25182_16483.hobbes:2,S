IIRC, these identifiers are reserved by the C standard, thus the
compiler is right to assume that they have standard behavior. And note
that they DO have the standard behavior. It even doesn't matter if GCC
is right to judge by the names in each and every case, it is right
in _this_ case.

Because it results in less optimization. I see no point in
deliberately preventing the compiler from doing optimizations.
