Correct me if I'm wrong, linux-wireless, but AFAIK there has never been 
a single post or line of code written for a generic wireless _mesh_ 
interface.
My general sentiment is -- remove the pointless and iw-duplicated 
ioctls, but leave the mesh ones that won't see generic counterparts for 
years.
