2.6 utilities, from people.redhat.com.

That kernel is AS2.1.  Due to lack of NPTL it doesn't work
correctly with everything in RHEL3 userspace...
Are you sure you're running RHEL3 and not AS2.1 ?
(btw, note that changing your kernel doesn't make the
 support people happy, and as a consequence probably
 means they won't want to help you ... read the fine
 print)
