From "try to help"? The l press was lost.

[Left] [Left] [Left] KP-4 <[Left] release>
This is a rather clear one. You press the grey [Left] key four times.
It has make code e0 4b and break code e0 cb.
Three times we get e0 4b e0 cb but once we get 4b e0 cb.
Surely, the e0 was lost here.

Rather similar. The e0 part of e0 50 was lost.

You were typing "paying" but the n press was not seen.

Some people have been reporting missing key releases (maybe also you),
but these are all missing key presses. It is easiest to blame the
keyboard, even though I could imagine ways to blame the kernel.
What about 2.4? Do you have to go back once an hour and add a symbol
that was not transmitted correctly? Does 2.4 work perfectly for you?
