Yes, this is a good point.  The via 'specs' (really they may not even be
from via.. but that's a different story) say that bits 5,6,7 are for the
MWQ Timer, but some people have reported really good results just clearing
bit 5 and leaving 6 and 7 alone (actually this was the original MWQ timer
patch).  I would be interested to see what bits are on for this guy by
default from his bios and which one causes problems when touched...
