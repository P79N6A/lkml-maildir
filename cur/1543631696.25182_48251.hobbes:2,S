Seems to me it'd be worth mentioning this issue somewhere in the
documentation or source.  One could get the impression that the
main issue for a CardBus-enabled PCI driver is to make sure that
the "new style" driver APIs -- with a DEVICE_TABLE etc -- are used.
(Maybe just a brief comment in <asm/io.h> ...)

I'm hardly averse to changing that loop (which normally does have an end :)
and I expected to need to at some point.  It's interesting to me just how
long that has been there without causing problems.  In this case the root
cause is that Cardbus "improper shutdown sequence" problem, so "no end"
is just a particularly nasty secondary failure mode.
