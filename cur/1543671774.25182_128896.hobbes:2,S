Is there a correct and portable way to implement mmap() for memory
allocated with pci_alloc_consistent()?  In the DRM drivers, PCI DMA memory
(for graphics chips that don't support a pcigart scatter-gather table) is
currently allocated with __get_free_pages(), so virt_to_bus() is used to
get the bus address to pass to the card for DMA.  I would like to convert
the drivers to use pci_alloc_consistent() instead.  These DMA buffers
(usually about 1-2MB worth) are allocated and held for the life of the X
server.
The current mmap() implementation for these buffers uses virt_to_page() on
the address from __get_free_pages() to reserve the pages and to find pages
in nopage().  However, I have seen references indicating that
virt_to_page() is not a valid operation on the cpu address returned from
pci_alloc_consistent().  Is this the case, and if so, is there a 
workaround or alternative?
Please CC: me on any replies since I'm not subscribed.
Thanks.
