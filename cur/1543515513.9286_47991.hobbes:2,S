But it's the high load case that it worth to improve. It's when the load
of my machine is very high that I want to see it to scale well.
I agree it may cut down latency when the machine is not under load of
course but I simply don't find it interesting enough.

And run the I/O completation irqs and controller logic and probably
protecting the cache with irq-spinlocks (to insert the page in the
available list in that complatation irq).
Doing it with an ad-hoc controller is going to improve performance of
course as you won't pay the cost anymore. That's a different scenario. The
only problem is that I am not aware of any zeroing hardare DMA controller
on my machines.
