As I mentioned before. I'm using a PIII,500Mhz,128MB Machine. Kernel
compiled with PREEMPT=y.
I boot into runlevel 3 and start
# hackbench 40
from the shell.
Just adjust the number so hackbench eats up all the memory.
I have some more test cases with real applications, but they are not so
easy to reproduce. Hackbench resembles the forking server quite well.
