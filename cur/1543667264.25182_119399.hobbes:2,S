Gee, you guys are good. Now I'm only left wondering how this setting could be 
reset to PIV, while I'm sure I set it to PII (as you can see from earlier 
postings, I managed to get it running till a SCSI lockup caused by probably 
IRQ prioblems). For now I'll not blame the kernel and tell myself I'm stupid 
;-)
