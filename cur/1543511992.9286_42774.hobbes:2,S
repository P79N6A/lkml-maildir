The /dev directory can still be "dynamic", the difference is that it's an
ext2 filesystem being updated from userspace, rather than a virtual devfs
filesystem being updated from kernelspace.
Realistically it only loses two features that people might covet (special
behaviour on open() of non-existent nodes, ability to use a non-UNIX like
filesystem for your /). The majority of people lose nothing.
Notice that what I'm proposing here is exactly like the cardmgr daemon in
the PCMCIA package. With the introduction of PCMCIA into the kernel, it's
sensible to make ALL devices contact a cardmgr-alike daemmon.

If modprobe starts dumping core you're in exactly the same pile of poo.
If init starts dumping core you're in exactly the same pile of poo.
If X starts dumping core you're at least pretty annoyed, if not in poo.
I don't think "but user space can crash" is a decent argument for putting
something in kernel space. It's even worse if it dumps in kernel space. I
like dynamic /dev: I don't care if it sits in user or kernel space.
