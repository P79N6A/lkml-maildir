There are some patches floating around adding support for VT6410
(not VT6420) to generic IDE PCI driver.  This controller may also work
with generic IDE PCI driver (PCI VendorID/ProductID needs to be added
to drivers/ide/pci/generic.h and drivers/ide/pci/generic.c).

"VIA want to make available code and other resources to appropriate open
source developers.  The VIA Open Source Developer's portal currently accepts
requests for IDE and Networking development as well as the CLE266 display
adaptor."
Unfortunately it seems I'm not "appropriate" enough as I didn't get any reply.
:/
BTW Does anybody has contacts in VIA?
