Subject: [PATCH 2/4] [fuse] fix deadlock between fuse_put_super() and request_end()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/25/65

A deadlock was possible, when the last reference to the superblock was
held due to a background request containing a file reference.
Releasing the file would release the vfsmount which in turn would
release the superblock.  Since sbput_sem is held during the fput() and
fuse_put_super() tries to acquire this same semaphore, a deadlock
results.
The solution is to move the fput() outside the region protected by
sbput_sem.
