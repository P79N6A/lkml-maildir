Hello,
i've created a small patch for the current kernel version which fixes a
bug in the DVB driver for b2c2-flexcop based pci devices. During
initialization of the pci device spin_lock_irq is called before
spin_lock_init. I've also created a bugreport in bugzilla:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8301
 . It would be nice if
someone could check this patch and perhaps apply it.
