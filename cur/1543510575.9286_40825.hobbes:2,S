It is guaranteed. You may just dump all the area between
mac.raw and skb->data, if these pointers do not coincide.
It is not a good idea to parse and interpert it in kernel though.
What's about dumping in output chain... It is non-sense.
I am sorry, it is better not to make this. This area will replicate
addresses of some earlier allocated packet with 100% of probability
and you may difame innocent people.
