Which looks like the the correct thing to do. In idedisk_error once the 
threshold for the maximum number of retries has been reached the request 
is ended because it cannot be serviced
	if (rq->errors >= ERROR_MAX)
		DRIVER(drive)->end_request(drive, 0);
in idedisk_end_request the request is explicitly set to NULL because it 
is now ended, in the code block...
	if (!end_that_request_first(rq, uptodate, drive->name)) {
		add_blkdev_randomness(MAJOR(rq->rq_dev));
		blkdev_dequeue_request(rq);
		HWGROUP(drive)->rq = NULL;
		end_that_request_last(rq);
		ret = 0;
	}
Which means that ide_dma_timeout_retry should take account of the fact 
that the request might no longer be valid before using it.
In other words it should be...
	/* Check whether the request ended early due to disk errors */
	if( rq ) {
		rq->errors = 0;
		rq->sector = rq->bh->b_rsector;
		rq->current_nr_sectors = rq->bh->b_size >> 9;
		rq->hard_cur_sectors = rq->current_nr_sectors;
		rq->buffer = rq->bh->b_data;
	}
If anyone has a better solution I would be glad to hear it. Failing that 
I'll submit this in normal kernel patch format as soon as I've worked 
out how...

Chris R.
