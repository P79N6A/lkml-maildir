I had already replaced 1004 with 1007 and it didn't make any
difference. I'd rather solve the problem than work around it,
as it does boot, it just might take a couple of resets to do
so.
I've done a bit more printk tracing and now it consistently
hangs following this path in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c
 1454           printk(KERN_INFO "..TIMER: vector=%d pin1=%d pin2=%d\n", vector, pin1, pin2);   
 1462                   unmask_IO_APIC_irq(0);
 1463   printk("io %d\n", __LINE__);
 1464                   if (timer_irq_works()) {
->
 1076   static int __init timer_irq_works(void)
 1077   {
 1078           unsigned int t1 = jiffies;
 1079
 1080   printk("io %d\n", __LINE__);
 1081           sti();
 1082   printk("io %d\n", __LINE__);
 1083           /* Let ten ticks pass... */
 1084   printk("io %d\n", __LINE__);
 1085           mdelay((10 * 1000) / HZ);
Following line isn't executed:
 1086   printk("io %d\n", __LINE__);
Further details to follow...
