I'll rephrase what I wrote and what people have been saying all the time:
"Once you build a binary module, it contains our (inlined) code and thus
 the binary module is a derived work."

We have yet to see if they actually found code.
And no; we're not saying all code is a derived work. We're saying that if
there is a few lines of copied code, then the compiled kernel which
contains object code coming from these lines is a derived work. If.
