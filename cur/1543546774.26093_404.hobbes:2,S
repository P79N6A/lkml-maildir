Subject: [PATCH][RFC] Adding KERN_* to all printk
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/8/26/80

I think all or almost all uses of the printk function should indicate its
severity, instead of relying on the default. So I want to ask if anybody has
any reason for NOT doing so.
Since it looks like I ended up being the defacto drivers/char/{rtc,nvram}.c odd
fixer, I made a patch for rtc.c which adds the severity to the three places
where it wasn't supplied and fixed one which was wrong.
Linus, please apply if you think it's correct.
