   i believe the original intent was to prevent anyone else from 
   appending to either of the lists while the lists are being joined.
   while it would be slightly less efficient, should it use the
   skb primitives?  this is quite a bit easier to read:
I understand why you think you have to lock, that isn't the issue.
I'm telling you that you should be locking this crap at a much
higher level.
