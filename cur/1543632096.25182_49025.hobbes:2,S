Whoops! Sorry I missed this bit of information; I know it's important.
'dmesg | grep gcc' reports this:
Linux version 2.4.19-pre8 (elparis@elparis-lnx) (gcc version egcs-2.92.11 19980921 (gcc2 ss-980609 experimental)) #7 Tue May 28 17:16:45 EDT 2002
Now, I have good news: Marcelo released 2.4.19-pre9 a little bit after
I started to play with 2.4.19-pre8, so today I grabbed -pre9, built it,
booted it, and now I have no problems whatsoever. Same compiler:
Linux version 2.4.19-pre9 (elparis@elparis-lnx) (gcc version egcs-2.92.11 19980921 (gcc2 ss-980609 experimental)) #9 Wed May 29 09:36:59 EDT 2002
Does this ring a bell, maybe something you fixed? (I see lots of fixes
from you in the -pre9 changelog.)
Let me know if you want further information, and thanks for whatever
magic you put into 2.4.19-pre9.
Cheers,
Eloy.-
