I think that the bug in the first place is to have an existing
kobject that didn't bump the module ref count.
If a kobject exists that have a pointer to the module code (the
release function), it _MUST_ have bumped the module ref count,
that's the whole point of the module reference count.
If rmmod blocks forever because that kobject has a stale reference,
that's a different problem, but khubd should not be involved in
that process and should definitely not be blocked and not wait for
the kobject to go away.
