Um.... ALL of them influence the kernel (although they technically
describe what the C library should provide -- but the C library can
only do this with the help of the kernel in most places), and yes,
IEEE wants a fee for it.  However, you can look at the Single Unix
Specification at 
http://www.opengroup.org/
 for a good idea.
