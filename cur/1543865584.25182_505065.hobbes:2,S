Many of those warnings I have already fixed. I had posted quite a few
patches. Looks like some of these have not made into mainline yet.
For ex...
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.20-rc6/2.6.20-rc6-mm3/broken-out/x86_64-mm-move-startup_32-in-texthead-section.patch
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.20-rc6/2.6.20-rc6-mm3/broken-out/x86_64-mm-break-init-in-two-parts-to-avoid-modpost-warnings.patch
I think I should trace the status of all the patches I had posted.
Thanks
Vivek
