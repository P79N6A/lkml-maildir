I have not?  This has been discussed before.

Think about suspend.  We want a single device tree so that the class
gets called when a device is about to be suspended so that it could shut
down the network queue in a common way, before the physical device is
called.
It's also needed if we want to have a single device tree in general.
class_device was the wrong thing and is really just a duplicate of
struct device in the first place (the driver core code implementing it
is pretty much just a cut and paste job.)  The fact that we were
arbritrary marking it different has caused problems (look at the mess
that input causes to the class_device code, that's just not nice).
Kay also has a long list of the reasons why, I think he's posted it here
before.  Kay, care to send that list again?

There has not been any real implementation yet, only a few patches added
to the core that add a few extra functionality to struct device to allow
class_device to move that way.  The patches that move the subsystems
over will be discussed (and some already have, like networking), when
they are ready.  Right now most of that work is being done by Kay and
myself as a proof of concept to make sure that we can do this properly
and that userspace can handle it well.
