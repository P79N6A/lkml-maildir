> Why there are different io adresses in lspci dmesg and ifconfig?
There is a difference between ioports and iomem.
/proc/iomem:
cfffc000-cfffcfff : 0000:00:04.0
  cfffc000-cfffcfff : sis900
/proc/ioports:
d400-d4ff : 0000:00:04.0
  d400-d4ff : sis900
ifconfig:
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0A:E6:98:ED:D7  
          Interrupt:201 Base address:0xd400 
> Any idea why it's not working???
"Not working" is vague. No packet transmission even though the link is 
active?
> I/O ports at e400 [size=256]
> Memory at de002000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256]
^^ ioports vs iomem!
