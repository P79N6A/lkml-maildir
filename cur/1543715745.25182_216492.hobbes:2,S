The function journal_set_features in fs/jbd/journal.c modifies the journal
super block, but doesn't not mark it dirty.  Seems an error, but could be
that these features don't need to be updated on disk.

[BUG] sb is modified but not marked dirty
/* Published API: Mark a given journal feature as present on the

int journal_set_features (journal_t *journal, unsigned long compat,

{
	journal_superblock_t *sb;
	if (journal_check_used_features(journal, compat, ro, incompat))
		return 1;
	if (!journal_check_available_features(journal, compat, ro, incompat))
		return 0;
	jbd_debug(1, "Setting new features 0x%lx/0x%lx/0x%lx\n",

	sb = journal->j_superblock;

	sb->s_feature_incompat  |= cpu_to_be32(incompat);
