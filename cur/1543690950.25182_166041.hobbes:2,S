Note the words "an athlon thunderbird processor".  The documentation says, as
I remember, that turning on SMP on a UP board should have no appreciable effect.
I take that back, it says it should run on many, but not all, uniprocessor machines.
So instead of what I said, please note that the K7SEM is a motherboard that will not
work with an SMP kernel.
