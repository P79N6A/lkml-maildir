I think the standard response people would give you is that your IDE cable
is too long, of bad quality, or you are using a 40-pin cable instead of an
80-pin cable (although I'm pretty sure that should have been detected, and
DMA should automatically have not been used, but I heard at one point that
the code which detected this on motherboards using the vt82c686b chip didn't
really work in some cases).
That's the standard answer, but I used to get this messages on my machine as
well (I think it was back when I was trying to use my VIA chipset with
Redhat 7.1).  I don't seem to get them anymore though, but maybe that's just
because I'm trying to install distros newer than Redhat 7.1.  That makes me
think that I never had CRC errors, it was just some buggy VIA code.
I just get the dma timeout errors now with my VIA IDE controller.  I also
get them with the Promise controller (sigh...).
