Ok, so you admit there are few cases where DSM is usefull. It can be
trivially rewritten, but trivially rewriting is additional work so DSM
can be usefull if you are lazy. I believe this was the case the other
guy was talking about. (If app is big enough, "trivial reritting" can
easily take you 2 days, don't you think so?)
