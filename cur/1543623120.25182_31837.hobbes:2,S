Yes, I did, and it has since been documented in the PCMCIA HOWTO,
section 2.3, subsection "Card readers for desktop systems":
  For Chase CardPORT and Altec ISA card readers using the Cirrus PD6722
  ISA-to-PCMCIA bridge, the i82365 driver should be loaded with a
  ``has_ring=0'' parameter to prevent irq 15 conflicts.
I had been trying the option "has_ring=1", which I didn't know was
the default.
