I've not had issues around the dcache for quite some time, I think not
since the 2.5.65 timeframe. IIRC maneesh and dipankar had some fixes
that resolved all my issues not long afterward. So unfortunately I have
nothing strictly dcache-related to report. Chris may have been
referring to some potentially pathological NFS behavior I've seen for a
long time centered around extended periods of knfsd unresponsiveness.
