The return path to user space checks for pending softirqs. A delay of
1/HZ is only possible if the cpu loops in kernel space without returning
to user space - and the functions that can loop check
'current->need_resched'. That means that either cpu_is_idle() must be
renamed to schedule_required() and all 'need_resched' users should use
that function, or something like your patch.
Is a full thread really necessary? Just setting 'need_resched' should be
enough, schedule() checks for pending softirqs.
And do you have a rough idea how often that new thread is scheduled
under load?
Btw, you don't schedule the ksoftirqd thread if do_softirq() returns
from the 'if(in_interrupt())' check.
I assume that this is the most common case of delayed softirq
processing:
; in process context
spin_lock_bh();
; hw interrupt arrives
; do_softirq returns immediately
spin_unlock_bh();
