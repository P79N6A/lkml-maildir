There is serialization at higher level. We take a write lock
on current->mm->mmap_sem at the beginning of elf_core_dump
function which is released just before leaving the function.
So, if one thread enters elf_core_dump and starts dumping core,
no other thread (same mm) of the same process can start
dumping.
static int elf_core_dump(long signr, struct pt_regs * regs, struct file * file)
{
	...
	...
        /* now stop all vm operations */
        down_write(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
	...
	...
	...
        up_write(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
        return has_dumped;
}
