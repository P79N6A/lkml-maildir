Hi. kernel hackers.
I use kernel 2.4.3-ac4 with smp support                                         
and I have found strange problem in using usb keyboard.
When I pressed CAPS, NUM, SCROLL LOCK key twice (toggle LED light on keyboard), 
Keyboard and console goes hang.
but up(uni-processor) kernel has no problem.
I use
gcc 2.95.3
glibc 2.2.2
make 3.79.1
binutils 2.10.1
util-linux 2.10q
modutils 2.4.2 
and used usb-uhci and keybdev modules.
anybody have been heard same problems?
