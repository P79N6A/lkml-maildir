   Umm, reading the code it looks more like the proper test would be
	   if (!tpnt->present)
		   return;
   because if "present == 0", then the host not only won't have had the proc
   entry added, it also won't have been added to the "scsi_hosts" list - so
   the "remove the adapter from the linked list" step is the wrong way around
   too. No?
The problem is that regardless of the tpnt->present setting, the
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT must occur.
   And again, why did this not show up with modules? 
I have no idea, I'm just the messenger in this case :-)
My situation was:
1) esp.c sym53c8xx.c statically built into kernel
2) I have 2 esp interfaces present in this machine,
   none for the sym53c8xx driver.
The boot logs looked something like (note the request_module messages,
wheee...):
request_module[scsi_hostadapter]: Root fs not mounted
esp0: IRQ 3,7e0 SCSI ID 7 Clk 40MHz CCYC=25000 CCF=8 TOut 167 NCR53C9XF(espfast)
esp1: IRQ 7,7db SCSI ID 7 Clk 40MHz CCYC=25000 CCF=8 TOut 167 NCR53C9XF(espfast)
ESP: Total of 2 ESP hosts found, 2 actually in use.
scsi0 : Sparc ESP366-HME
scsi1 : Sparc ESP366-HME
scsi : 2 hosts.
...
Partition check:
 sda: sda1 sda2 sda3
esp0: target 1 [period 100ns offset 15 20.00MHz FAST-WIDE SCSI-II]
SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 4194995 [2048 MB] [2.0 GB]
 sdb: sdb1 sdb2 sdb3
...
scsi : 2 hosts.
And precisely here is where the OOPS was seen.
