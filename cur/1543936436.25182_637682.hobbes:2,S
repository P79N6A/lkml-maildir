NAK. This is a qemu/kvm emulation bug. The real check is there to catched
jammed IRQs and combined with the IRQ bug handling nowdays does actually
do the intended job.
Our serial port code (correctly) interprets a continuous stream of bytes
at an impossible bit rate as an error. KVM should be emulating to some
extent at least the timing on serial interfaces or using a virtualised
interface.
