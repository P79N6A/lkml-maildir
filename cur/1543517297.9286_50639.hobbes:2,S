oops, right. The swap offset (the pfn of the swap-page) was encoded as-is
into the pte's higher 24 bits even in 2.2, this gives a limit of 64GB
swapspace on 32-bit platforms with 32-bit ptes. PAE mode raises this limit
to 16TB, as there are 32 bits worth of pfn encoded in the upper 56 bits of
the 64-bit pte.
