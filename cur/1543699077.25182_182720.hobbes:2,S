I usually state in header files that are likely to be taken elsewhere
what license applies without copying the full license or excerpts
thereof into the header. That should be sufficient. There is no need and
no desire to have all possible variants of GPL summaries all over the
tree.

Too long-winded and IMHO too easily misunderstood. The GPL itself
contains a "how to apply..." (this license to your code) section, and I
see no reason for any deviation from the suggestions stated there.
Even a copyright line and "you may only redistribute this file in
concordance with the terms of the GNU General Public License, version
(whatever applies) (optional "or any later version clause") is
sufficient according to the GPL.
If people actually read the full COPYING file, there'd be no reason for
such stupid GPL "clarifications". Such are not necessary. If the file is
meant to be offered under more than one license (say, BSD "no ad clause
version"/GPL is found sometimes), then that is certainly doable without
GPL "clarifications". The GPL is clear.
Note: IANAL.
