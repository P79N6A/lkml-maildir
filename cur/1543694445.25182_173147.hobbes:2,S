But at the same time we rely on TCP/IP which uses a hash (checksum)
to detect back packets.  It seems to work well in practice even
though the hash is weak and the network corrupts a lot of packets.
Lots of machines dont have ECC ram and seem to work reasonably well.
It seems like these two are a lot more likely to bit you than hash
collisions in MD5.  But Ill have to go read the paper to see what
Im missing.
Thanks,
Jim
