It's based on the clocksource_hz2mult() calculation. It tests multiple
shifts until the largest workable one is found.

This seems like a problem with the current method also.. Given that
people just "select" a shift, they could pick one that is too large or
too small easily. 
The method in this patch is not very sophisticated, so we could make it
take more into account.
