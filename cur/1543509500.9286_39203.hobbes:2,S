   When you F_SETSIG an RT signal, as you probably know it'll fill in
   si_fd with the file descriptor. Stephen's patches also fill in
   si_band to tell you what kind of operation the signal is for, that
   way you don't have to poll() or select() on the FD to see what kind
   of operation should be performed (at least that's my understanding).
   Hopefully these will be integrated into the stable tree soon since
   without it, SIGIO doesn't do much for you.
Even without it Stephen's patches, you can do a nonblocking read to see
fd has become readable, which is often sufficient in many applications.
Obviously things are much better and easier if you have the si_band
information, of course.
