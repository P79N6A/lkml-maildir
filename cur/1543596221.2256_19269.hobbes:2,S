I am running linux 2.4.2 on Apple G4 machine. I think the 'PCI bus
addresses' and 'physical addresses' are same on this architecture. I
expected the two be different but according to asm/io.h 'virt_to_bus(addr)
= virt_to_phys(addr) + PCI_DRAM_OFFSET'. I printed the value of
'PCI_DRAM_OFFSET' and that come out to be zero. Is this correct?
If I somehow get the physical address of a user space buffer in a module
and take this as a PCI bus address, will I be able to do DMA properly?
thanks,
Daljeet.
