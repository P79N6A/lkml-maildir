Yes, but as developing code is human-bound (waits for my input most of
the time), it is not *that* important. [It is probably still nice to
have it fast.]
OTOH: gcc is faster 64-bit, and if you mix 32-bit and 64-bit, you
loose caches and have twice as many libraries. I guess 5% faster gcc
is more important than 30% slower ls...
