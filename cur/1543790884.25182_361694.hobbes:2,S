Subject: [PATCH 10/10] UML - Make tt mode-dependent options depend on MODE_TT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/30/245

This makes some of the tt-specific options actually depend on
CONFIG_MODE_TT.
