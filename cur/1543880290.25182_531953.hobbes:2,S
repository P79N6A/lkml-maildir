and here's a top snapshot:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
 9324 mingo     20   0  300m  59m  17m R 96.4  6.8  21:00.55 kaffeine
 9325 mingo     20   0  300m  59m  17m S  2.0  6.8   0:15.57 kaffeine
 9327 mingo     20   0  300m  59m  17m S  2.0  6.8   0:20.10 kaffeine
so 9324 doing the mpeg decoding seems to be stuck somehow?
