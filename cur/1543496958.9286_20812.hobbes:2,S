Hi,
this problem is going on since 2.2.0-pre<x> times, but today I found some
news on it:

It is "something odder".  I just retried it, and it still happens with
2.2.9.
Recap: Asus P2B-LS board, onboard EEpro100 (i82555) chip, standard 2.2.9
eepro100 driver.  Card connected to a dumb 10 mbit only ethernet hub.
Everthing works fine, quick, and reliable with 2.0.36 (RedHat 5.2).
Running 2.2.9, after a while of network inactivity on this host, the
machine starts spewing "junk packets" on the network - slowing a SCO
machine in the same LAN down to a crawl.
Sometimes, but not always, this is accompanied (sp?) by 
  eth0: Trying to restart the transmitter...
  eth0: Transmit timed out: status 0050  0000 at 146/162 command 00000000
messages (command being 000c0000 sometimes, the 146/162 numbers varying)
Running tcpdump in "promiscuous" mode stops the effect, running it with
"-n -p" (no DNS, no promisc. mode) shows absolutely nothing when this
happens.
Interesting enough, /proc/interrupts showed an increas of IRQ activity 
when this happened - about 2 million more entries in just a few seconds.
No IRQ sharing active on the board:

eth0: no IPv6 routers present
Hmmm.  Let's try this without IPv6.  *recompile, reboot*.
Gotcha.
 - Boot without IPv6, wait for 30 minutes, regularily look at 
   the Ethernet LEDs and /proc/interrupts -> nothing unusual,
   network is healthy.
 - "insmod ipv6.o", watch some IPv6 ND packets, notice the
   message "eth0: no IPv6 routers present", and suddenly the
   eepro100 interrupt counters start increasing like crazy 
   (200000 in one minute) and the 2.2.9 box floods the network 
   with garbage.
   After doing some "normal IPv4 traffic" (ping neighbour), this
   stops, and after a few minutes, starts again.
So there's definitely something fishy going on with the combination of
eepro100 and IPv6.  Bad, since I really want to start deploying IPv6
in our local test bed here (as soon as RIPE hands out some v6 addresses).
