Subject: [PATCH] Hold BKL for shorter period in generic_shutdown_super().
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/16/215

Testing revealed long pauses of the entire system while autofs initiated
umounts as a result of timing out the mounts.
It was noticed that during a umount, the BKL is held while scanning
the inode_list and removing and inodes that are candidates.  This patch
moves locking until after the first pass had gone through the inode_list.
Testing revelead that on an ia64 machine with a filesystem that had
8.4 Million inodes, there were no observable pauses during the umount.
This was down from over 4 seconds without this patch.
