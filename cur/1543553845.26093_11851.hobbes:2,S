part of my syslog:
 orac kernel: ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78
 orac kernel: PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:0f.0.
 orac kernel: ALI15X3: chipset revision 193
 orac kernel: ALI15X3: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
But  then:
orac kernel: trident: unable to allocate irq 0
orac modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module sound-slot-0
orac modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module sound-service-0-0
amd there isn't any sound anymore!!
It was a nice working Trident Microsystems 4DWave DX (rev 01)
