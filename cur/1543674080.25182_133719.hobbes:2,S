Hello All.
I have the error showed in the subject with my ATi 7500 Radeon
I am not sure if this is the correct place but as the error says kernel
context I am writing here.
Well, afer that error shows itself in the output of dmesg, the console
freezes, and I can only access my box using a remote station and telnet or
ssh
The keyboard and monitor are dead.
Any ideas? Mr Google doesnt know a bit about it.
