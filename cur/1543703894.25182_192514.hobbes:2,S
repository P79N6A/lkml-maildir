CONFIG_REGPARM doesn't work on gcc-2.95 (at least), due to apparent
miscompilation or misdesign of strstr().  There are probably other such
issues.
So yes, whatever compiler you are using, turn off CONFIG_REGPARM - it is
still very experimental.
(And of dubious value - it only saved me 0.6% of program text).
