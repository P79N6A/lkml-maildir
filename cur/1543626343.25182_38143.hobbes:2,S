Hi.
Is it possible to obtain per process statistics in linux 2.4/2.5?
e.g. #ticks the process is assigned to a PE (Processing element), #ticks 
  suspended (blocked) state, #ticks on runqueue? etc.
The reason for me asking is that I want to simulate some load-cases on 
Linux, and therefore need some real data on how process on behaves.
(How much CPU-time does it want/need, How often does the process suspend 
itself and for how long, etc.)
Anyone out there who as information on this. I was hoping to simulate a 
gcc process. Then add 200 of them, and see how my small simulator 
behaves, and compare this to how things are actually working in Linux.
(the old `make bzImage -j 200` test.)
Regards
Anders Fugmann
