There's no "i2c web site". And no, I'm not breaking people's setup for
fun. The drivers in question are small, I don't care that much if they
stick around. If we can remove them (as is the case for i2c-ixp4xx),
great, let's go, but if not, there's really no reason to make
gratuitous trouble.
The patch I have in my tree now removes i2c-ixp4xx and leaves
i2c-ixp2000 and scx200_i2c alone. They can always be removed later if
the respective platforms are updated to use the generic GPIO layer.
