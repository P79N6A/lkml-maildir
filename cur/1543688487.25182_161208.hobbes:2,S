Yes it seems quite likely. Further poking reveals that the
box still locks with a PS2 mouse _and_ the USB mouse. A PS2
mouse on its own allows the system to boot, although
interrupt 10 (eth0, usb) is not working. Booting with
acpi=off allows the system to boot normally with the USB
mouse, and interrupt 10 works.
