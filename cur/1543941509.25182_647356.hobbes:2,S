It will work except under new X.org, which disables BIOS backlight
functionality in order to do it directly, at least on Intel GPUs (and
probably also on ATI GPUs.  nVidia is no-man's-land).
And I have been told that X.org can do 256 backlight levels on Intel
hardware *including* switching the backlight off, instead of just the 16
levels Lenovo chose to export through ACPI.   Looks like someone should
add a kernel framebuffer device for those Intels :)
We really need to solve the userspace mess, though.
