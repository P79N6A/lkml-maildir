Hi Andy

well I find it confusing because in my mind, something like this seems
more logical.
#ifndef CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_STATIC
static struct mem_section *sparse_index_alloc(int nid)
{
        return alloc_bootmem_node(...);
}
#else
static struct mem_section *sparse_index_alloc(int nid)
{
        /* nothing to do here, since it has been statically allocated */
        return 0;
}
#endif
This code only deals with section allocation and the way it's achieved
depends only if the section array has been statically allocated.
There's nothing related on the two-level lookups here, is there ?
And use SPARSEMEM_EXTREME when it deals only with two-level lookups:
#ifdef CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME
#define SECTIONS_PER_ROOT       (PAGE_SIZE / sizeof (struct mem_section))
#else
#define SECTIONS_PER_ROOT       1
#endif

nope but maybe a comment to explain why i386 use SPARSEMEM_STATIC
option could be useful. At least for someone who is not working on
this arch...
Thanks
