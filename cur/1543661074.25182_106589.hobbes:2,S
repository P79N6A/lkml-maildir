At least the former case seems like it should be easily detectible.
The cacheline setting "must" be supported (sez the PCI spec) if MWI
can be enabled ... and may be supported in other cases too.

At least on 2.5.59, the pci_generic_prep_mwi() code doesn't check
for that type of error:  it just writes the cacheline size, and
doesn't verify that setting it worked as expected.  Checking for
that kind of problem would make it safer to call pci_set_mwi() in
such cases ... e.g. using it on a P4 with 128 byte L1 cachelines
would fail cleanly, while on an Athlon (64 byte L1) it might work
(depending in which top bits are unusable).
