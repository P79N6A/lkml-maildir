*When* does the manager checks for it?  The clone might not have
executed a single instruction when the clone() function returns.  And I
don't want to add a mutex etc in there which means lots of more
syscalls and context switches.

I'm not sure what you mean.  You can compile without the compatibility
stuff.  At least this is what is done if you configure for i686.
