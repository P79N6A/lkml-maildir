Hi,
If you've got this line in your /etc/fstab:
/dev/hda5 /mnt/win_d vfat quiet,iocharset=iso8859-1,codepage=850,umask=0 0 0
You will get the following message during mount -a:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hda5,
        or too many mounted file systems
I've chessed out that the problemataic part is the codepage=850. When 
I've removed it the mount goes ok.
My system:
Linux version 2.6.0-test8 (root@localhost) (gcc version 3.2.2 (Mandrake 
Linux 9.1 3.2.2-3mdk)) #3 SMP Mon Oct 20 12:32:45 CEST 2003
After this I've patched my kernel with supermount patch for 2.6.0-test7, 
but doesn't work. After configuring, recompile, and installing I still 
get this message:
mount: fs type supermount not supported by kernel
Please feel free to ask me about these problems and CC me, while I'm not 
on the list.
Kind Regards,
Chip...
