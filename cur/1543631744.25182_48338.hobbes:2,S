I'm sure you know this route is not very useful - there's practically
nothing that we can push across the hard RT divide anyway. We can't do
meaningful filesystem I/O, memory allocation, networking, or VM fiddling -
what's left?
Cleaning up soft RT latencies will make the vast majority of people who
think they want hard RT happy anyway.
