Looks good, with a few minor things that I can see:

This function should take a struct pci_dev * as a paramater, that way we
don't have to do:

All of this is not necessary, as the pci core will give is a proper
pointer to a device that is in the pci device list that is passed to it.

You can drop the #ifdef and change the dev_info() and dev_warn() calls
here to dev_dbg().

Here's where we can just pass the dev paramater to the function.
Other than those minor things, it looks very good.  Almost ready to add
to the tree.
