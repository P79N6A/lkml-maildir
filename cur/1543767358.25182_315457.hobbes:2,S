Hub driver is using SIGKILL to terminate khubd. Unfortunately on a number of 
distributions switching init levels implicitly does "killall -9", killing 
khubd. The only way to restart it is to reload USB subsystem.
Is signal usage in this case really needed? What about replacing it with 
simple flag (i.e. will patch be accepted)?
TIA
