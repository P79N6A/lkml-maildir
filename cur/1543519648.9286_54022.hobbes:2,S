See, that's not possible.  There is no glibc-devel for 2.0.7 with 2.2.13.  
There isn't going to be one.  And upgrading to glibc2.1 is a pain I'm not in 
a position to deal with at the moment --- and only defers the problem until 
the next time a new kernel doesn't match the installed glibc.
(hint:  glibc upgrades are much, much more painful than kernel upgrades.  
"upgrade glibc" isn't an answer.)

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
