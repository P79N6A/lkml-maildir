A few minutes ago, I got the following:
Feb  3 13:09:10 pea kernel: UDP: short packet: 0/58
.. and the driver hung.  I had to reinsert the card to get
networking back.  This is after 10 hours of uptime, using
the patch i sent previously against 2.4.1's xirc2ps_cs.
So the answer is, yes, it happens w/ 3.1.24's driver.  Any
suggestions?
