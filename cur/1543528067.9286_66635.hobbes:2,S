Sure. It appears that the kernel "devfs" actually writes to UFS.
I'm not about to suggest that we do _exactly_ as Solaris does.
I do think that the config file syntax and paths are good to use.
Using "/devfs" instead of "/devices" is needlessly different.
Hopefully we don't need Linux-specific filenames and syntax.
BTW, I'd love to know why you found Solaris drivers painful.
I took a Solaris driver course, and they don't look too bad.
