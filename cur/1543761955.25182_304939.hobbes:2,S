I'm running 2.1TB and 3TB filesystems on ext3 here. It's probably not fast or optimal, however it's 
been solidly reliable. The 2.1 has been running since May 2004 with a reasonable workload. The 3TB 
is only 4 weeks old, but has been beaten pretty hard during burn-in testing.
x86-32 with 2.6.[5 6 9 10] on the 2.1 and 2.6.11-bk's on the 3.
Both filesystems have been filled to capacity during testing and real use. I unmount them and e2fsck 
-f them weekly just for a laugh also. Never a hitch.
Regards,
Brad
