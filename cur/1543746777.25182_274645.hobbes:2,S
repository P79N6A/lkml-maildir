It's a shame _they_ didn't know well about this problem five or so years
ago when the rest of us did. Oh well, it's on the list of things to
attempt when I can actually stomach it.
In the meantime, don't even think about claiming that netfilter is an
example of _anything_ which you can hold up as an example when we're
talking about cleaning stuff up. Breaking it in its current state would
be a feature, not a bug.
