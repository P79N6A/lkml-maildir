Absolutely correct.  I was being a bit short with that example, in real
life it would be more like this.
#ifdef CONFIG_MODULES
int dynamic_syscall_in_modules_helper(int syscall, struct module *mod)
{
	/* blah, blah, blah */
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(dynamic_syscall_in_modules_helper);
#endif
The whole function would depend on CONFIG_MODULES, not just the export.
That's what I get for trying to save bandwidth ...
