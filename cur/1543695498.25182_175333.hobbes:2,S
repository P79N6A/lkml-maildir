    I need this patch to use the scroll wheel on my Logitech mouse
with my Belkin KVM switch in 2.6. This patch was in -mm for a while
before some changes there broke the diff, and I got some mail from
people who said it was helpful.  I didn't hear about any problems.
    Linus, will you please consider applying it?
    The new mouse autodetection sets my mouse up to use the Logitech
ps2++ protocol, but Belkin KVMs speak only the Microsoft Intellimouse
protocol and plain ps2.  In 2.4, with X and GPM set up to use the
imps2 protocol, things work fine -- my mouse also speaks imps2 -- but
in 2.6 I don't get a choice.
    One person also used it to disable the Synaptic touchpad driver at
runtime without disabling the scroll wheel on their external mouse.  I
think the parameter this patch adds should cover most regressions that
have to do with the mouse autodetection, since the Intellimouse
protocol seems to be kind of a lowest common denominator because
Windows supports it out of the box.
    Unfortunately, I was unable to get any sort of comment from
Vojtech Pavlik about this patch.
