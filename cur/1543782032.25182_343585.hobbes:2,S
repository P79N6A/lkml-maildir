I turn off VC logging, and I turn off disk sync'ing, so it goes
straight to the page cache.
I really do need sub-microsecond timings when I put a lot of
printk tracing into the stack.
This is a useful feature, please do not labotomize it just because
it's difficult to implement on ia64.  Just make a
"printk_get_timestamp_because_ia64_sucks()" interface or something
like that :-)
