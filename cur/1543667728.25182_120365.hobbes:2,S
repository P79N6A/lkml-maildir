Where can I find working "modelines" for Radeon 8500?
I have a 
   radeonfb: ATI Radeon 8500 QL DDR SGRAM 64 MB
I am interested in 1024x768 and 1152x864. I have tried the defaults
that come with Debian fbset (2.1-8) but I get garbled screen upon
changing the video mode. I can 'clear' the console and work more or
less normally but the viewport will be just a part of the whole
screen.
Thanks,
florin
