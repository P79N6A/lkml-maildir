I'll send out a revised patch later, thanks!  It's also good
this code got a more careful read.  It seems like some things
are not as obvious as I might like...
That patch will merge those list corruption fixes I sent, the
"else" you verified was needed (ugh!!!), and some of what you
include here.   It won't add new BUG_ON calls (WARN at worst)
or a duplicate ED state (see next).

The current implementation _does_ poison memory on free, if
slab poisoning is enabled.  (That's why I asked if you were
using it.)
And that's been quite handy for reporting list corruption bugs,
from races or otherwise. But those list corruption bugs hit a
blind spot in that code:  it doesn't check for modify-after-free.
Which is why those bugs were able to hide for so long!
It'd be good if you said _how_ you think it relies on such
internals.  Some of your debug diagnostics wrongly claimed
allocation of "new" EDs when they were just being re-used.
That'd make intentional/safe re-use look like a bug or race.

There's a wmb() before any ED is handed off to the OHCI silicon;
that forces a defined order.  Top of ed_schedule().  First use,
or Nth re-use; no matter.

If you assume a bug where the ED is freed but still in use,
that's hardly the only thing that'd go wrong!!  You can't
use such a potential bug to prove something else is broken.
