Looks like you did not understand the background :-(
In order to use kernel interfaces you _need_ to include kernel include files.
This is in particular true as long as we are talking about beta/testing kernels.
Background: on homogeneous platforms like e.g. Solaris or FreeBSD which are
	maintained and distributed as whole, an _enduser_ should include
	files from /usr/include only. 
	This is not even true for people who do Solaris or FreeBSD kernel 
	development and like to test new features with user level programs.
	It is definitely not true for compilations against Linux kernel
	interfaces.
Linux is not a homogeneous system. There is a separately developed kernel and 
a separate base user level system. People often install a newer kernel and need 
to recompile software because the kernel/user interfaces are not stable between
different Linux releases.
These people need to compile against the recent Linux kernel include files if
they use Linux kernel <-> user level interfaces.
-	... why do you believe that #ifdef __KERNEL__ kernel do exist inside 
	Linux kernel include files if they are not intended for user level 
	programs?
-	How should user level program that depend on kernel interfaces be 
	compiled if not by using kernel include files?
