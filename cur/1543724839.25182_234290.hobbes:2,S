...in the eyes of real-life (Linux distributor's) software support it is. Not in

The syslog was full with attempts to access the device outside its limits. Seems 
there was some  bad constellation after the kernel crash.

(after two days of work and reinstalling about 90% of the RPMs I have a working 
system again. The other stupid thing that doesn't belong to this list is: RPM v4 
fails to install a package if one of the packet's file targets exists as a 
directory (happened after the crash and fsck to me). RPM then seems unable to 
cleanup and leaves aditional files with a semicolon and hexadecimal number as 
suffix then. Repeated invocations create new files then...)
