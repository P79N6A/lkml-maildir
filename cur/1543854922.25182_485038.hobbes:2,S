Hi guys.
Just to let you know that I haven't given up on sending the stream of
patches I started a few weeks ago. It's just that since then I've gained
a more urgent priority - my final exam prior to ordination as a minister
has been approved for March, and I have lots of preparation to do for
it.
Regards,
Nigel
