Could we get some quant here?  How small is "small"?  How large is
"large"?  What are you measuring?  What are the results?  Does the app
re-use the same data, or is its use a one-time deal?

No, the Linux VM system should automatically cache for you.

Check out the commands "free", "vmstat 1", "top", the contents of
/proc/meminfo, the output of Sysrq-M.
Most likely is that your app isn't behaving in a cache-friendly way.  If
your file will fit in memory, just fault it in sequentially (wc -l file)
and then your app should cook.  If you're not going to fit in memory,
the vm caching will probably only help if you have some reuse; you could
develop a pre-faulter to get your IO started ahead of time, but that's
generally nontrivial.
