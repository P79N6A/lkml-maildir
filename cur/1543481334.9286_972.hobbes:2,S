please read this thread again yourself and try to separate facts from advocacy...

which gives absolutely no additional or relevant information when printing
both values with only shifting the decimal point
do you realize that in your example and kernel output it is
	1 MB == 1024 * 1024 
	1 GB == 1024 * 1024 * 1000 == 1000 MB
                              ^^^^
and so far I haven't seen any reasonable argument why for GBs we're mixing
powers of 2 and powers of 10, whereas MBs are just powers of 2...

this all doesn't exaplain why for GB numbers we mix 1024 and 1000,
giving twice the same digits with only decimal point shifted.
if just makes no sense and gives no new information, the 2nd value
should be based on either all powers of 10 or powers of 2 -- I'd vote
for the latter (and tried to provice a fix for this for years now:-(
