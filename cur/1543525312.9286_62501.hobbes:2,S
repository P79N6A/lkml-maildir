Has somebody patched devfs to work with reiserfs? The devfs won't apply cleanly after I patched the kernel with reiserfs. I would really love to test devfs but I already hae my file systems running reiserfs and I don't want to convert back to ext2.
Probably then next 2.3.x releases will allow that??
Regards
Martin
