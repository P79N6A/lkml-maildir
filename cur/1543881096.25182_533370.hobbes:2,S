I think a sched_yield_to is one interface:
   int sched_yield_to(pid_t);
For futex(), the extension is needed for the FUTEX_WAIT operation.  We
need a new operation FUTEX_WAIT_FOR or so which takes another (the
fourth) parameter which is the PID of the target.
For FUTEX_LOCK_PI we need no extension.  The futex value is the PID of
the current owner.  This is required for the whole interface to work
in the first place.
