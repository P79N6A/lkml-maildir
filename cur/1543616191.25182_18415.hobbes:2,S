Morten,
There is a bit more involved than just switching
io_request_lock to host_lock. The former is global
so it could be called from anywhere.

It will work if the first controller is allocated irq 10,
the second one irq 11, etc.   Unlikely ...
Looking at that driver it seems that it will need a
bit of surgery to pass perhaps a Scsi_Cmnd pointer
through the request_irq() function so you can
follow a pointer chain in do_Irq_Handler() to get
hold of the appropriate host_lock.
In the lk 2.5 series host_lock should indeed be held
when the callback "scsi_done" is invoked and that
most likely occurs in Irq_Handler(). So that is right.
BTW To get a better idea of what is involved, diff the
sym53c8xx driver in lk 2.4.15 and the one in the
lk 2.5 series now [kudos to Gerard Roudier].
Having been burnt by a well meaning advansys patch that
converted a kernel compile time error into a kernel
boot time freeze, it is a bit worrying the number
of "untested" patches of this nature appearing on lkml.
