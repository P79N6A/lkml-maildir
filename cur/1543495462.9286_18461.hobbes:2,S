Actually, it's sizeof(struct netdev { __u32 len; __u32 mark; char
interface[IFNAMSIZ]; }) + 65535, otherwise you may get an incomplete
packet.

Always one.  One read, one packet; it's not a stream socket.  Alexey
explained this to me in little words.

Always the start.

Since late in the 2.1 series, if the packet can't be queued for
netlink, it is dropped inside ip_fw.c.  You also get an read() failure
and errno==ENOBUFS (IIRC), which can be ignored, but tells you that
packets were dropped.  (In fact, there's a net_ratelimit'd printk as
well, which you can remove if it bothers you).
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
PS. The ipchains-dev list at rustcorp.com is good for furthur questions.
