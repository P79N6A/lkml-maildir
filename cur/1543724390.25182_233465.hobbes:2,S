But if the user space service is sitting in the kernel's dirty memory 
writeout path, you have a real problem: the low memory condition may 
never get resolved, rendering your userspace service autistic.  
Meanwhile, whoever is generating the dirty memory just keeps spinning 
and spinning, generating more of it, ensuring that if the system does 
survive the first incident, there's another, worse traffic jam coming 
down the pipe.  To trigger this deadlock, a kernel filesystem or block 
device module just has to lose its cluster connection(s) at the wrong 
time.

I'm certain there's a solution, but until it is demonstrated and proved, 
any userspace cluster services must be regarded with narrow squinty 
eyes.

I suspect you have underestimated the amount of development time

Humble suggestion: try grabbing the Red Hat (Sistina) DLM code and see 
if you can hack it to do what you want.  Just write a kernel module 
that exports the DLM interface to userspace in the desired form.
