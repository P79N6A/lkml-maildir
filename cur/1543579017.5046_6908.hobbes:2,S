Are you sure about that?  According to my documentation on installing linux on a G4
with scsi disks, you need to specify a device enumeration string like the following
to tell the system where to look for the boot device:
/pci@f2000000/pci-bridge@d/ATTO,ExpressPCIProUL2D@4,1/@6:5
where the '6' is the SCSI ID of the drive, and the '5' is the partition number of the
boot partition.  So if you change SCSI IDs or add a new partition and change the
partition numbering of the drive, your computer can't boot anymore.
