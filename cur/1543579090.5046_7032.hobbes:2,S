#include <hallo.h>
I got a "Tyan Thunder HE-SL"-Mainboard today, which has a "Severworks
ServerSet III HE"-Chipset. (2xPIII 933, 2x512MB PC133 ECC-Registered
SDRAM)
And i have one problem and one question.
First the question. I have an uptime of phenomenal 29minutes and "cat
/proc/interrupts" tells me this
NMI:     175819     175819
LOC:     175829     175828
Should i be worried? Or can i ignore it. With my former Mainboard NMI was
(AFAIR) always 0.
Now my problem.
The Graphic-Card is a Geforce 2, Xfree is 4.02 (compiled under 2.2.17).
When i start X, everything is fine. When i go back to text-console and
wait "some time" and then switch back to X the computer locks solid and i
have to press the Big-Red Button. (Switching back to X after a "short"
periode of time, at the text-console, works "normaly")
If anyone needs more information, i will happily provide them.
Bis denn

wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
