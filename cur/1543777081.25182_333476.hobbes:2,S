USB mice generally run at low speed.  This means that you _can't_ plug it 
into an EHCI controller -- the controller will see that it's not a 
high-speed device and will hand it over to a companion controller, which 
in your case will be UHCI.

Use "usb-handoff" and turn off BIOS USB mouse support.

I'll be interested in seeing if you still get the "IRQ 21 nobody cared" 
message.
