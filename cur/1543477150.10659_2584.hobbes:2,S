Yes.  Things like svgalib and XFree86 use this to access video memory.

How do you know it is physical address 0x3fe3000?  Have you checked the
pte?

It's true, if it were a file, the pte would point into the file.

What platform?  /dev/mem might not behave the same on some
architectures.  And do your changes affect /dev/mem?

If you're trying to map any old memory and get its physical address, the
best way is undoubtedly write a device driver to kmalloc() memory, have
the driver return the physical address through an ioctl(), and support
mmap() for that device.  The driver's mmap function will set up the page
mappings; see the sound driver for an example.
If you're trying to access a memory mapped device, mmap() on /dev/mem is
what everyone else does.
