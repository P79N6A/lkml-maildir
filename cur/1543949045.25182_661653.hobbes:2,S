i think it's also a good learning tool. Subscribing to git-commits-head 
might be more useful to a newbie these days than subscribing to lkml :-/
and one area where commit messages are totally important IMO is bug 
forensics. For every regression we find we try to put in the commit ID 
that broke it. Information like that is vital to have a good (and 
objective) picture about how bugs get into and get out of the kernel and 
it also alerts us to change/improve infrastructure if certain categories 
of bugs happen too often.
