hmmm, could be... i had a problem with ide before... i connected an old 4x
cdrom drive, and when accessing it, the sound slowed down (soundblaster
awe64 pnp, alsa driver). and most corruption could be caused during a high
pci load, so this could be a hardware problem. anything you might want to
know aboiut the board?
