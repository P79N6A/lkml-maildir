Everyone realizes the protection is minimal, right?  If you boot into
a default kernel, and administrator is careless with the system
configs because SELinux means that "it doesn't matter" if the intruder
cracks root, then all someone has to do is crack root when the system
is mistakenly booted using a default kernel.  At that point, running
debugfs or some other tool with direct access to the hard drive is the
least of your problems; the intruder can just simply trojan some
executable (or the kernel for that matter) that will be trusted once
SELinux is booted again, and it's all over....
