I did check that with _PAGE_PROT_PRESERVE_BITS defined to zero,
compiler optimizes vm_get_page_prot_preserve to generate same code as
vm_get_page_prot with no function call (on x86 64). So, things should be OK
from overhead perspective. But, from the code cleanliness aspect,
PRESERVE_BITS looks unclean and needs some cleanup. The reason I posted the
patch as is, was to get the confirmation on the original thread, whether this
indeed fixes those PAT related error messages.

Probably other architectures does not depend on preserving things in
vma->vm_page_prot once ptes are set correctly. With PAT, we use
vm_page_prot to keep track of PAT attributes for vmas from parent to
child across fork.
pte_modify() part will be required in all archs that wants to preserve
some bits in pte in a mprotect call.
