Here are my comments on the filesystem menu:
That "FS_POSIX_ACL" line is very odd.
What can be done about/with it?
Quota and Automounter:  are they filesystems?
I know, you didn't change that.
Anyway, they are more like FS options or tools.
I would put the list under "Miscellaneous filesystems"
in alphabetical order.
Did you modify "Network File Systems" or "Partition Types"?
Anyway, they are sort of in historical order and I would
put them in alpha order too unless there's some
compelling reason not to do that.
