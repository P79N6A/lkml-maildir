It relies on HPET. The LAPIC is just used as a mechanism which allows
us to broadcast the tick to both cores.

Yes, it's definitely worth fixing, but it's not trivial:
For Highres/dyntick we need per CPU clock event devices to avoid
serialization and broadcasting overhead in the normal operation mode.
The LAPIC timer is per CPU, fast and the best thing we have, except
for C1E enabled AMD systems.
The perfect solution for those systems would be to use the HPET
channels seperately as per CPU clock event devices. Venki tried this
some time ago, but it's hard to resolve simply because none of the
BIOSes gives us an idea to which interrupts we can route the HPET
channel interrupts. The only choice we have is to use the legacy
interrupts, which gives us the headache of emulating the RTC via the
HPET and some other stupid legacy issues.
We can not utilize the broadcast mechanism of the cpuidle code because
we do not have an idea that we are going into C1E as it is done
magically in the SMM code. To work around this is we would need to add
the broadcast notification to the halt(), safe_halt(), pm_idle_halt()
variants which float around in the kernel and make this conditional on
the C1E detection. That's nasty, but it seems the only solution for
now.
