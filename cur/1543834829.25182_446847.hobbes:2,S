I can't explain why, but this is not sufficient. Gentoo now have 2 
completely separate bug reports where the quirk is *only* needed when 
ACPI/APIC are enabled.

I'm not disputing that there are other systems where the opposite is 
true, but at least with our current level of understanding we cannot 
apply the quirk on an irq-type basis.
