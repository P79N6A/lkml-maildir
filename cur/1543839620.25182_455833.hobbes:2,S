Well, I assume that if some code defines a syscall, it will actually use
it. Of course I meant to ask if the users of those definitions are going
to just call sys_whatever.
For example check_host_supports_tls in arch/um/os-Linux/sys-i386/tls.c
which even uses the global errno (although in that case the whole
else part could probably be just removed).
