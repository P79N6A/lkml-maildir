We found the same on ia64-sn systems with tg3 a couple of years 
ago. Using simple interrupt coalescing ("don't interrupt until 
you've received N packets or M usecs have elapsed") worked 
reasonably well in practice. If your h/w supports that (and I'd 
guess it does, since it's such a simple thing), you might try 
it.
