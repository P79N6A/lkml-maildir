The patch to 2.4.16 + rielvm (well, a merge between my VM and
Andrea's VM) is available on my home page and seems stable now.
FYI, my 64MB dual pentium test box seems to "happily" survive
a 'make -j bzImage' over NFS...
However, I suspect this unresponsiveness issue is related to
either IO scheduling or write throttling, and that code is
the same in both VMs. I'll take a look at smoothing out writes
so we can get this thing fixed in both VMs.
The patch is on

Rik
