The debug serial unit is part of the mainline kernel, this is the common
link to work with the CSB637 Cogent board.
I don't know about others AT91RM9200 based board.
AT91RM9200 also have others USART, but there are no available output
connectors on the CSB637 board.

That scares me.  Is the debug serial unit added by you, or is it part of
the mainline kernel?
