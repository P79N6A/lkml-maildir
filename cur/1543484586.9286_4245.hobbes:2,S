2.2.0 has an awful bug that was the main reason for the quick release
of 2.2.1. There should not be any difference that could affect
performance. The bug-fix was an off-by-one calculation problem in
freeing pages.
This could (will) eventually free a kernel structure and you are
gone. You will probably find that the mere re-booting of your
system (not the kernel version change), temporarily fixed your
problem. I am sure that there are other bug(s) in 2.2.1, some
symptoms of which I have reported. However, I am using it.
It is much more secure than 2.2.0, and it hasn't trashed any
file-systems.
I am also sure that the current bug(s) are being hunted down.
The more persons who use the newest kernel, the more problems
will be discovered. Eventually, someone who knowns the mm or
whatever intimately, will be able to find the common thread
of our many observations and another bug gets zapped.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson

Penguin : Linux version 2.2.1 on an i686 machine (400.59 BogoMips).
Warning : It's hard to remain at the trailing edge of technology.
Wisdom  : It's not a Y2K problem. It's a Y2Day problem.
