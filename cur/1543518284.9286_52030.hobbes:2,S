I don't like this at all and it is really unnecessary.
First, it's easy enough to recompile glibc if there is a new calling
convention.  One only has to change one definition in the sources and
recompile.
And second, mentioning the sources, take a look at
sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/sysdep.h.  The macros to create the
syscall code goes to great length to generate optimal code.  I.e., no
additional arguments pushed etc.
IF/When sysenter comes it's easy enough to provide an alternative
sysdep.h version which has the definition for the processors which
support them.  You can even have libraries with and without this
system call mechanism installed at the same time (e.g., when the
directory is exported via NFS) and the ld.so will pick the right one.
You are only wasting cycles without gaining anything which is not
possible otherwise as well.
