I've not seen that one.  It's _possible_ that it's caused by the
same get_request bug: although that's over in a different subsystem,
it does mess up the preempt_count/hardirq_count enough to be able to
cause such a problem elsewhere.  But I see this message came 87 secs
after your others, which makes that unlikely.  Do you still see this
__kfree_skb badness after running with the get_request fix?
