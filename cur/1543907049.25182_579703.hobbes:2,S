i have no fundamental objections but it would be nice to actually 
prototype this by implementing real priority support in the hardware: 
both the i8259A and the IO-APIC/local-apic has such IRQ prioritization 
features.

this should be a numeric scale. (Preferably in the 1-99 range (the 
hardware can then do a lower-resolution thing out of it), so that we can 
directly map this to IRQ threads and SCHED_FIFO priorities in -rt.)
