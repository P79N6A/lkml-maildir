ok, that looks like quite sensible semantics.

ok, this sounds good too. The disadvantage is the reduction in utility. 
Actual applications and users will decide which variant is more useful in 
practice - it does not complicate the design unreasonably.

(btw., the percpu allocation code seems to have bitrotten a bit - the 
logic around perf_reserved_percpu looks wrong and somewhat complicated.)

hm, i guess this could be improved: by queueing pinned counters in front 
of the list and unpinned counters to the tail.

yeah, agreed.

Yeah. Such artifacts at inheritance stem from the reduction in utility 
that comes from any exclusive-resource-usage scheme, and are expected.
For example, right now it works just fine to nest 'timec' in itself [there 
is a reduction in statistical value if we start round-robining, but 
there's still full utility]. If it used exclusive or pinned counters that 
might not work.
Again, which restrictions users/developers are more willing to live with 
will be shown in actual usage of these facilities.
