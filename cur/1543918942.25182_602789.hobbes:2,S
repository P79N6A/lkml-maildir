You remember that you could start them both from DOS by typing "win" ?
If you hit ESC during the first seconds when the logo showed, you could
get back to text mode to see the messages.

I found them "fun", it reminded me of the DOS-version of borland C, 15
years ago :-)

One solution against this and which may satisfy people who are against
this idea, would be to just manipulate the bold and reverse attributes
for errors. On VGA consoles, this would translate into printing in
white instead of grey, and it could also work on ANSI/vt100 terminals.
After all, if the initial intention was to report errors in a more
noticeable way, let's not let the user choose the colors and have
them defined the hard way. It will prevent the salad colors from
appearing.
