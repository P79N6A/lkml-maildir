Ok, so if someone sent you ABCDEFGHIJ, all before you could read anything
from the UART, where I causes an overrun, you'll read ABCDEFGHJ, but the
status associated with H will indicate an overrun condition?
However, either way the behaviour after the overrun condition has no
bearing on what follows.
Your overrun behaviour is near enough to typical 8250 behaviour that you
can use the helper provided - uart_insert_char().  This eliminates the
special flag handling you seem to have created.
IOW, you want to do:
	ch = read_uart_fifo_data_register();
	status = read_uart_status_register();
	/*
	... error processing ... to set flag but omitting overrun.
	... don't do ignore processing here - uart_insert_char does
	... that for you ...
	*/
	uart_insert_char(port, status, STATUS_OVERRUN_BIT, ch, flag);
For an example, see receive_chars() in 8250.c.
