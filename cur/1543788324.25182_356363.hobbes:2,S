I'll make some changes based on the suggestions I've received. Those who
request the return of keyfs can go boil their heads.

Should I expand the permissions mask to include a setattr?

That's not really a per-key type of thing.

Would it be worth me adding a key type op by which a security module can ask
the type its opinion (or by which key_alloc() can ask the type to give the
security module an earful)?

Okay.

Should this really be securified? It merely controls the default destination
for a key created by request_key(), and is limited to the keyrings the process
is subscribed to in any case.

This does need a security hook, at least for joining an existing session.
I wonder if I should treat named sessions on a per-user basis and whether I
should separate them from keyrings, so that session names refer to keyrings
and have their own permissions and security, but aren't those keyrings. This
latter bit is the big stumbling block that I had with the clone-handle
functionality that Kyle Moffett woulkd like.

Really? Why?
Note that the fact that key_permission() fails for a key is sometimes ignored,
such as when I'm doing a search and one potentially matching key fails, but a
subsequent matching key passes.
