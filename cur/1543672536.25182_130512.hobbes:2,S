(c) Modify the drivers to fit into your kernel. (See below).
    As far as I know this is the only long term stable approach.

There is no stable Linux kernel API for drivers.  There is a software
interface but it is continually morphing, changing becoming different
and hopefully better.
The only practical solution I know of (short of porting Linux to run
on top of your kernel), is to use the Linux code as a base as a starting
point and derive your own drivers.  Everyone who attempts to just
reuse the Linux drivers gets stuck with a snapshot of the kernel
at the time they did the work.  Later kernels always wind up unsupported.
The successful example I know of is etherboot.  Where many of it's drivers
are derived from Linux but it is an entirely different source base.   So
etherboot and Linux evolve at different rates.  
Beyond that the whole closed thing is a turn-off.  Which is likely to
reduce interest in your research OS and get you no free feedback on
the weird situations.
