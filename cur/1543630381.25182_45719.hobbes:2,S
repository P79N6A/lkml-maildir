Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.1[345]-dj Add cpqarray_init() back into genhd.c

In 2.5.13-dj1, the call to cpqarray_init() in drivers/block/genhd.c was
dropped. I'm not sure what the intent was since the driver seems to work fine
as a module. In case it was a mistake, here's a patch (against 2.5.15-dj1) to
add it back in. Without it, cpqarray only works as a module. Works For Me (tm).
