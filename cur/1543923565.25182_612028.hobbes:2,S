Why don't you use `am33' for the arch name?
Do you have any plans to support am30 (mn10300) or any pre-am33 processor cores?
I know the mn10300-* target configurations are also available for toolchains,
but it is for historical reasons.
Even the GNUPro packages have the release name am33-04r2-5 instead of mn10300-*.
The same arch name would be better for the same architecture
among the toolchains, the kernel and the library, not to confuse contributors.
GNU libc has used am33 for the machine name since the architecture was
supported.
