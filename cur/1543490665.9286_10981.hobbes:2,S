Exactly. They read and write from a full track buffer. The ordering of the
sectors on the physical media can be in a totally random order. The drive
electronics simply start reading or writing the appropriate sector to or from 
the appropriate buffer location when the head is over the start of a sector
that needs to be read or written.
