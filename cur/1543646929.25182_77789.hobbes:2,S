Subject: experiences with 2.5.40 on a busy usenet news server

Just FYI:
So I booted 2.5.40 with the raid0 fix on our usenet news peering
server yesterday. It is a box that exchanges binary feeds with
about 40 peers, 400 GB/day in, 600 GB/day out.
It's a dual PIII/450, 1 GB RAM, 4x18 GB article spool directly
on partitions (not raw, but normal partitions). INN-2.4/CNFS.
With 2.4.19, it runs fine. With 2.5.40, it goes wildly into
swap. I'm assuming the I/O is pushing the newsserver binaries
and database mappings into swap.

No need to swap 364 MB when there's 872 MB still free...
This makes the machine dogslow. An 'expire' process that
runs every night normally takes 15 minutes to finish now
has been running for 10 hours and its still not finished.
Article acceptance rate has halved, the machine can't keep up
with the binaries it is fed.
I'm going to risk corrupting the databases and reboot back
to 2.4.19 now.
Mike.
