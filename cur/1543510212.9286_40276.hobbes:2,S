Is this intended? Is it what you had for previous builds?

Which drive is your root fs on? If it's on the scsi drive, check that
the root is specified correctly either in the kernel (rdev) or your boot
command line (lilo, etc). If it's on the IDE drive, I would recommend
either building it into the kernel or setting up an init rd.
If the above is no help, you know more than I do.
