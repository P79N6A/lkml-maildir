Fix your application.  The rules are very simple - /usr/include/linux contains
versions of headers used to build libc.  If you are linking against libc,
you don't want to have different parts of resulting executable to be
compiled with different versions of these headers.  If you want several
definitions from headers of your current kernel - extract them (and make
damn sure that you don't pull a conflict with libc headers).
IOW, create a private header with definitions you need.  And you'd better
make sure that stuff you are pulling is stable, obviously - if it changes
from version to version you are going to run into serious trouble at
runtime.  "Rebuild whenever you boot into new kernel" is not a good idea...
