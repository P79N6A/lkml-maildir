Amen to that.  STREAMS would be one of the strongest arguments in favor
of Linus' theory that evolution takes care of it.  STREAMS were done at
Sun by some "architects" who thought they would be better than sockets.
Linus is dead right, on this sort of issue, Linux responds quickly and 
weeds out the crap.  We still have some room for discussion on the 
design issues, but yeah, Sun blew it on this one and refused to admit it.
