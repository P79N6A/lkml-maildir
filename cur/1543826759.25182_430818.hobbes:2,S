I must have picked the wrong place to cc.

I thought so.  That is why I did it against both 2.6.17-rc6 and 2.6.16
(since I use it with 2.6.16).

Hmm, perhaps.  I just wanted something that made it obvious in dmesg
which driver I was running.  I see tulip actually does put it in the
version instead.  I don't remember where I got the driver name change
idea from.

The same thing as if it was done before enabling napi.  From a few
messages I have seen, it doesn't work right now, and it won't work any
better with my changes.  I have never tried changing the ring size on
the fly, so I don't know.
It appears that the port is stopped before the ring size change is done,
although I can't really tell how it handles things if the queue is not
empty when it stops the port.  Does it try to handle anything left in
the ring first or does it just toss those packets? (That I would
consider wrong).

Hmm, I just followed what appeared to be in pcnet32_rx and how tulip and
a few other drivers had done their napi conversions.  It certainly works
for me the way I did it.  Haven't seen any lockups yet.  I do see that I
am not holding the lock when I acknowledge IRQs in pcnet32_poll, which
pcnet32_rx doesn't need to worry about since it is called from the
interrupt handler which already holds the lock.  That should be fixed
then.
So I can do:
        // Clear RX interrupts
        spin_lock(&lp->lock);
        lp->a.write_csr (ioaddr, 0, 0x1400);
        spin_unlock(&lp->lock);
That part seems simple enough to protect.
Is this safe without holding the lock?
    } while(lp->a.read_csr (ioaddr, 0) & 0x1400);
Not sure how to wrap a lock around that one without holding the lock for
way too long.
perhaps:
        spin_lock(&lp->lock);
	state=lp->a.read_csr (ioaddr, 0) & 0x1400;
        spin_unlock(&lp->lock);
    } while(state);
Does that seem more reasonable?
