The fan did help, and Andi is right, the chip was much hotter than what
my probe read (I was gently pushing it against the top of the chip, cause it
was too hot to really press my finger against it to get good contact :))
With the fan blowing on the chips, it has been perfect.  This implies to me
that if you are going to run the e1000, you need significant air-flow over
the chipset, and the generic 2U chassis that I have is definately inadequate,
partially because the MB is so big that the fans are too far away from the
PCI slots...  This is all doubly true if you are running two NICs side-by-side,
which is what I was doing.
I am also considering glueing heat-sinks onto the main chip, which may make it
work in more marginal environments.
