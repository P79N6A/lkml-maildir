I'm forced to agree with you, but have a couple of concerns:
Is there anyone out there who is going to argue against using an fs
interface when I submit it ?  Speak now or forever hold your peace !
If dm now misses the feature freeze deadline due to this extra work,
is it going to be possible to still place it in 2.5 at a later date ?
(dm with an ioctl interface is better than no dm at all).
