I've just compiled 2.6.15-rt2 on x86_64 SMP (dual Opteron) and it's giving
a lot of weird instabilities. If I start jackd (this is an audio workstation)
with realtime privileges from an xterm I get a lot of spurious xruns. When I
first start it, moving the mouse makes the xruns scroll off the screen.
That stops for a couple of minutes, during which there's a slow but
steady stream of xruns. After two or three minutes the xruns suddenly
scroll off the screen too quickly to read, and keep going until the jack
watchdog timer kills jackd (the latter is usually caused by the two
wordclock-locked sound cards losing sync with each other, which
shouldn't happen). Sometimes X locks up shortly after this and it needs
a hard reboot.
None of the above happens with a non-rt kernel, and I've had the same
thing with 2.6.15-rt1 and every 2.6.15-rcx-rtx kernel I tried.
Here's an excerpt from dmesg that may shed some light on this:

Is there any more info I can supply to help debug this?
