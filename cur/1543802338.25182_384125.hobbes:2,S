Not providing orderingor barriers makes this a rather risky thing to export
- people might use it, find their driver "works" on one architecture, but
fails on another.
I guess the "__" is a decent warning of this, and the patch anticipates a
higher-level raw_memcpy_toio32() which implements those things, yes?
How come __raw_memcpy_toio32() is inlined?
