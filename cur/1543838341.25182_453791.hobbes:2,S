I don't understand that.

I do understand that.  This'll cause some grief.  I'd suggest that we add a
new unregister_char_dev() or something, and do
static inline unregister_chrdev(unsigned int major, const char *name)
{
	return unregister_char_dev(major);
}
then migrate callers over to unregister_char_dev() in an organised fashion,
via maintainers where poss.
Then mark unregister_chrdev() deprecated for a while.
Then nuke it.
