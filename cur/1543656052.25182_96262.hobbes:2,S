&lt;&lt;Interfaces should NEVER change in patch level versions.
Just *DO NOT DO IT*.
&gt;&gt;I do agree on this.
This is a common complaint about linux kernel developers. And this always gives an insecure feeling  :-) for the device driver or kernel module programmers. 
This was one of the issues in my earlier company/work and they have gone for another OS.
Warm Regards

I agree strongly with Donald.

Go wild in odd-numbered.. get the interfaces right there.
But leave them alone afterward.
This is a fundamental tenant of being professional. Otherwise, the kernel
people are the biggest reason I've ever seen for using *BSD.
Microsoft is not the real enemy. Gratuitous change is.
