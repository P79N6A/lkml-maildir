Hi folks ,
I ve heard that the divert socket mechanism is not supported anymore in 
the current linux kernels .
I was surprised to know that , is there a reason ?
then I wanted  to use an older  kernel but I couldn t find informations 
about which kernel support the divert mechanism ,
I know there are some patches but couldn t find any of them ,
so please,  does any one knows where can i have such a patch to make my 
kernel support divert sockets ?
Many thanks .
