8527 was merged before -rc1 so it is expected that resulting kernel was
called 2.6.24 (though it wasn't really 2.6.24) if CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO
config option is disabled (it is useful to have it enabled).

This is worth a try but please remember that the problem may not show up
immediately so it would require few tests to verify each commit (it is also
possible that the problem won't show up at all if we are unlucky).
