Yes. And ofcourse it isn't so I feel like a right boob. Now, compiling
the right sensor (adm) gets it registered and promptly crashes the
kernel. Once this happened whilst in the kernel, either mid scroll of
the fb or mid write of a new line on screen and another time this
happened mid-fsck (no partitions needed fscking). Witht he wrong/no
sensors module in the kernel runs just fine.
My experience with the sensors code is evolving. :)

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
