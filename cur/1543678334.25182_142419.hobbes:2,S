Hi,
Thank you for your comment.

You are right. (u32 *) cast is more suitable in the assignment to
gatt_table_real member.
(I was in a hurry and just thought (void*) was
useful in places where we are sure
we are doing something correct (like assigning
a pointer to a different pointer [of different type.]), and
yet do not want to bother much with the correct
types of the LHS of assignment.
(Comment added: thus using (void*) to save the
checking of the type of LHS side.).

Unfortunately, GCC 3.3 is so clever that
mere type casting (as you suggested) still produced warning.
Only after assigning to an integer variable, I see
the warning message gone. Tough luck.
Agreed. The remedy is very ugly.
