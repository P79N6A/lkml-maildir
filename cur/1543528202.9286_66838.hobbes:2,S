It's definitely indicative of instability.

The above is bad. Your ISA interrupt probe is just not doing too well at
all.. Sometimes nothing, sometimes a partial list.

This looks much better in that the interrupt probe itself is definitely
more successful, but at the same time you lost your PCI interrupt which is
really strange. The PCI interrupt is assigned by the BIOS or by the
kernel, and that assignment should be quite repeatable.
Mind attaching a fill dmesg for the two cases?
