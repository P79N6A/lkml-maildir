Christophe,
You have to walk either the active or scratch BIO to satitsfy the FSM for
completion of a "DATA_BLOCK".  Where "DATA_BLOCK" is variable in lenght.
Also you may not update or acknowledge the return of any BIOS regardless
until the status of the "DATA_BLOCK" is known.  Status is always checked
after the transfer but you are not permitted to check it then in pio
period (excluding soft-poll completions, unsupported in Linux).  Only
after the next interrupt returns can you querry the status of the previous
"DATA_BLOCK" transfer.  Then and only then can you leave the FSM to deal
with  the needs of BLOCK.
Trust that Bartlomiej gets the point, I spent a long time making sure
somebody did before I burned out.
Cheers,
