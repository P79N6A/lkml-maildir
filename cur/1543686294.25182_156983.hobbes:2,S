Something about the 2.6 (and the rmap patched 2.4) kernels causes
lockouts on the server -- for reasons OTHER than kswapd.  The server
running the delete-old-files process runs hundreds of other CPU and disk
I/O intensive processes/threads, and it doesn't look like 2.6 is yet able
to handle the load.  Unfortunately, the server is a production environment
machine at a remote site, so lockouts/reboots/kernel panics are baaaad :(
I've seen other mentions of kswapd/kupdated problems in 2.4.xx, but
few mentions of solutions.  Have people just learned to avoid the
situations that trigger the mad thrashes?
