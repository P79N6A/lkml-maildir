Sounds exactly like the symptoms that lead me to this patch
(against test7):
   http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106606272103414&w=2
The issue could show with any resume where the USB controller
lost power, so the devices (including root hub) which were
there before the suspend need to be removed during resume.
That would include swsusp, as well as D3cold.
Patrick has a similar patch, which he's not yet submitted.
