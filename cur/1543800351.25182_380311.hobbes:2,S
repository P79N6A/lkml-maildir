As shown in my previous mail, it allows malloc() to return NULL. I've
also successfully verified that it allows mmap() to fail if there is
not enough memory. I disabled swap, and set the overcommit_ratio to 95
and could not kill the system. Above this, it becomes tricky. At 97, I
see the last malloc() calls take a very long time, and at 98, the
system still hangs. But 95% without swap seems stable here.
