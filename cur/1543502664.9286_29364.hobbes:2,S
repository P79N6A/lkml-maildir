Nearly.  The ext2 filesystem keeps a cache of recently-accessed bitmap
buffers pinned in memory, and once that cache is primed you can't flush
it unless you unmount the filesystem.  If you have any processes still
cd'ed to the active filesystem, then they will also be keeping directory
inodes pinned in the inode cache.
