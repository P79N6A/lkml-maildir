I don't think it's a refcounting problem.  My guess is that the 
underlying cause is the bug in your urb->status removal patch for 
usb_start_wait_urb() -- the one I fixed here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb-devel&m=118531582013355&w=2
Of course, my guess could be wrong.  I haven't tried to recreate 
Linus's bug with that patch reverted.  But with the patch present I was 
not able to duplicate the bug.
