The "standard" way of achieving the same would be to assign the variable
to itself. In your fragment the compiler will initialise the variable to
zero which will cost at least one instruction and thus "bloat" the code,
it'll also be slower due to an additional instruction and may schedule
worse. Not that it mattered much in this case but if you can save a byte
or two... :)
