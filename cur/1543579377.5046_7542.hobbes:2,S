Would reiserfs be better and does it now work with SW Raid5?

On the two machines I have tried both have 256 MB of memory and one
has a 8GB Raid5 and the other has a 30GB Raid5 partition.

I will try.

I am not sure if I understand you correctly: with 48MB you do get
corruption and with 192MB not? And if you do see corruption are you
using SW Raid, SMP?
