You must be an American. Most old the worlds keyboards have an AltGr
key. You'll find that US keyboards have two alt keys to avoid confusing
people (like one button mice ;)) but the right one is understood by the
X bindings to be "AltGr". Even though the US keyboard is apparently
lacking functionality its purely a text label issue
