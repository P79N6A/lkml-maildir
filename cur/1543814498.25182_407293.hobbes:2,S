after 3 days of uptime on a slightly newer kernel..
signal_cache         134    143    696   11    2 : tunables   32   16    8 : slabdata     13     13      0 : globalstat   98892    176   173  156                              0    0  129  940 : cpustat  19802  17821  36683      2
the other had seen a little more abuse. These last three days, that
box has been quite idle most of the time, whereas the box that crashed
was my workhorse for most of last week.
