Who do you think you are that you can call me a pig?
Are you so independently wealthy that you don't have to
work for a living? Do you think the management at
Red Hat will allow you to continue to abuse customers?
I have been very conservative in taking abuse from you.
I have even respected your right to an extremely obtuse
and naive concept of intellectual property and how
"GPL" strings somehow validate something. However, I
shall not allow you to call me a pig. You will retract
that statement or I will use all means at my disposal
to have you terminated from your place of employment.
Very Truly Yours,
