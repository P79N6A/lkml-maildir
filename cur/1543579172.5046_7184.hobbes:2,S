Andrea, if you have the time, please do check out the
FreeBSD and NetBSD VM code.
The FreeBSD code has the original Mach overengineered
abstraction layer, but an absolutely kickass page
replacement strategy.
The NetBSD code has cleaned up the abstraction layer
into something nice and lower overhead, but has a lot
simpler (probably lower performance) page replacement.
It would be cool if some of the Linux hackers could take
the time and look at this code to see if there are some
good ideas we might want to have in Linux.
It might just be the case that we DON'T want to reinvent
the wheel (that others have made into a nice round shape
with 15 years of trial, error and redesigning).
(though I know some people prefer reinventing wheels ;))
regards,
Rik
