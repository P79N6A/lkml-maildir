Can this be configured to start slashem instead? ;)

What scares me is, "Is there any code in the kernel that does this, or 
something similarly stupid?". I regard the linux kernel as mostly sane, and 
I'd rather not have that illusion of safety broken* any time soon. Sure, its 
great for an app to randomly segfault, but having the kernel oops randomly is 
not much fun.
To quote a sig I once saw on usenet: "Why Linux is better than Windows, Reason 
#325: No needing to reboot every 15 seconds; or every 3 seconds during full 
moons."
