Subject: Add watchdog timer to iseries_veth driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew, please apply:
Currently the iSeries virtual ethernet driver has no Tx watchdog
timer.  This makes it vulnerable to clagging up if the other end of
connection is misbehaving - in particular if it is not giving timely
hypervisor level acks to our data frams.
This patch adds a watchdog timer which resets the connection to any
lpar we seem to be having trouble sending to.  With any luck the other
end might behave better after the reset.  If not, this will at least
unclag the queue for a while so we can keep talking to the lpars which
are behaving correctly.
