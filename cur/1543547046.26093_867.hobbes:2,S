last time i looked (somewhere around 2.3.4x), all the B-tree directory
implementations in the kernel were broken.  That's HFS, HPFS and NTFS.
None of them consider the race where an insert occurs into the tree
while you're doing a readdir.  I thought about how to fix it for ext2
btrees but I haven't come up with a satisfactory solution yet.
