Hello!
   Today, while playing with sleep mode of USB device I have, I got
   kernel hang on my SMP box (2xP3-667, 386M RAM, Abit VP6).
   Scenario was like this: background mpg123 over esd to
   00:0b.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs SB Live! EMU10000 (rev 08)
   minicom over ttyS1 to device, USB netlink (usbnet.c) to device over USB.
   I told device to go to sleep, it reported (over serial console that I
   looked at with minicom), that it turned off internal devices
   (including USB client), reported it is going to sleep, and turned
   serial and itself off.
   Suddenly mp3 playing stopped and I got this (decoded) diagnostics
   from kernel:
ksymoops 2.4.0 on i686 2.4.5-ac7.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.4.5-ac7/ (default)
     -m /boot/System.map-2.4.5-ac7 (default)
Warning: You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will
assume that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running
right now and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
