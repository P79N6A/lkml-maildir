Of course, they are unavoidable. However, they are as fast as the one

You also need:
3) Prevent less privileged subtasks from loading segments belonging to
   more privileged ones
This can be done in hardware using the x86 privilege rings, at the
cost of limitations on the number of subtasks and the inability to have
protected pairs of subtasks where none is more privileged than the other.
Of course it is also possible to do this in the kernel, or in a
privileged user-mode task using LDT/TLS system calls, by modifying
descriptor tables on interprivilege jumps but this is obviously
significantly slower.
Anyway hardware-based and kernel-based privilege separation can
perfectly coexist.
