Hi,

Using "arch/i386/kernel/crash.c" is just for explanation how we avoid
the hang. (I found x86_64 kdump is not supported in 2.6.11-rc2-mm1 :-))
The attached log is a log of running mkdump (it supports x86_64). not kdump.
The basic procedure before jumping new kernel is almost same as kdump.
So I inform this infromation to you since I think it may be helpfull 
for kdump development.

I see. Thank you for your explanation.
Thanks.
