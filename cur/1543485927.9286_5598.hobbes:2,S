One doesn't like unions and uses them sparingly. Which reminds me, even
though unsigned long is safe, a per-arch typedef of some sort is still a
cleaner implementation, as you may end up with an arch where
sizeof(int)==sizeof(long)/2==sizeof(void *) and longs are less efficient
than ints. 16-bit x86 is one example, and I expect we'll see more when we
get over the 64-bit horizon.
