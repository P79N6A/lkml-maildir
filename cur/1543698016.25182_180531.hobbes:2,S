Jes didn't _limit_ the allocation to the memory on a node, he _based_
it on it, instead of total memory for all nodes.  Therefore a 1024
node NUMA machine with 2GB per node has no bigger hash tables, than a
single CPU machine with 2GB total memory, however big that may be.
Unless I didn't understand his patch, that is. :)
