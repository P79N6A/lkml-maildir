Why doesn't the intruder just simulate login process (printing "login: "
and "Password:")? That's known and used for ages.
The root user (and any other user) should press the SAK key before
attempting login. It should a) reset terminal to a sane state,
b) terminate and/or disconnect all processes from current tty.
Alternatively, he/she should hw-reset/power-cycle the terminal,
if possible (say, with serial/X-terminal).
OTOH I don't know why ordinary users should be allowed to change key
bindings.
BTW: Not sure about Linux consoles, but in general ESCape sequences
can redefine key bindings as well. That's why SAK/reset is so important.
