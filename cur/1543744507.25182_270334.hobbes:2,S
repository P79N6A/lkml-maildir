Hi,
I have written a multisession data DVD with Nero Burning ROM.
Then I have added one more session and I have closed the disc
with NEC ND-3500AG DVD/RW.

The content of this disc is accessible without any problem under WindowsXP.
Under Linux, when I try to mount the disc I get an error:
[root]-[/media] # mount /dev/hdc dvd/
mount: block device /dev/hdc is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdc,
       or too many mounted file systems
[root]-[/media] # dmesg |tail
hdc: ATAPI 48X DVD-ROM DVD-R CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache, UDMA(33)
(...)
Unable to identify CD-ROM format.
I can mount this disc with 'mount -o loop /dev/hdc /media/dvd' 
but I can see only the first session.
Playing with 'mount -osession=...' doesn't work.
dmesg #
(...)
Invalid session number or type of track
Invalid session number
Have you got any idea about this behaviour?
Is it possible to access all sessions on this disc?
