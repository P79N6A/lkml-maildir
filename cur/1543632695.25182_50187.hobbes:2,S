Hello
main()
{
    ....
    signal (SIGIO, signalhandler() ) ;
    ....
    sleep (65535) ;
    ....
}
signalhandler() { ... } 
Assume the frequency of IO events is faster than one
event per 65535 seconds. Therefore, let's consider
65535 as infinity (sleeping foreveR).
If a SIGIO arrives, main will get out of sleep and
continue running, but signalhandler will be invoked
too. I wanted to know if there is any order/priority
for sleep() in main, and signalhandler() to be called
first, or one of them is invoked first randomly (race
condition) ?
I myself ran the program many times and everytime
observed signalhandler responding first. But maybe it
is not a rule, and it was just my chance ?
Thnx for your comment !
