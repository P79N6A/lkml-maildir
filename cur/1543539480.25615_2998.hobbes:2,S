Could be, it looks like a loop. Usually I'm inside X and can't even
switch to the console (or change desktops) to look at the error
messages...
By "crash" I meant that I had to press the reset button.

I compiled a new kernel (btw, I didn't `make clean', I just patched
filemap.c and did a `make zImage', I remember it used to be a no-no
with 2.0, is it ok w/ 2.2?) and tried:
$ perl -e 'while (1) { $a[$i++] = 1 }' &
When the swap was exhausted, the behaviour was:
1) Console: perl was killed with an `out of memory' message.
2) Console with X, netscape and emacs running: I still get
   VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed for ...
   repeatedly.
Thanks,
