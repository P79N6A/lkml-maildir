Upon moving from -mm2 to -mm3, my vfat filesystems did not automatically 
bount at bootup as per the fstab and could not be accessed by 
applications in Gnome ie. my mount point showed no subdirectories or files.
I could manually mount (not by mount /mnt/win_c but by the full mount -t 
vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt/win_c) and I could explore using ls in terminals but 
programs in Gnome could not open the filesystem.
Upon rebooting into -mm2 everything was fine again.
