Yeah it wouldn't be too difficult

Yeah it wouldn't be too difficult Con. Basically you can add a flag to
a domain to enable some scheduling "quirk".
In this case you would add a flag to the domain which balances logical
cores in the physical CPU. You can then look up your lowest domain
with cpu_sched_domain(cpu). If the domain has the required flag set,
you can look at its ->span - which in this case would give you all
logical CPUs (siblings) on this package.
I need to actually do a bit more work and verification on the SMT
setup and make sure it plays nicely with non-ht systems, but after
that I'll probably look at this issue if someone hasn't beaten me to
it.
At the moment I've got my hands pretty full though so it might take
a while...
