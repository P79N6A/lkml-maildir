We are using Linux as a bootable CD for system
configuration.  We would like to keep all the
information displayed at bootup hidden.  The main
reason for this is because our users see words such as
"error" and "failed" and it bothers them (though there
is nothing wrong).
Anyone know how other than changing the kernel code?
Thanks
