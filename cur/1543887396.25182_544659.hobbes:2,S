My pleasure! Just a small side note/question: On my first
mail i CCed Christoph Goos who is noted in skfddi.c to
be the maintainer,
but i finally received a failure notice containing
Remote host said: 550 5.2.1 <cgoos@syskonnect.de>... Mailbox disabled for this recipient
So, are you Mr. Goos' successor and to be contacted on
changes/suggestions for the skfp driver in the future?
Thanks,
Frank
