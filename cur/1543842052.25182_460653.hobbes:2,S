You're right, I should have been more specific when I said  
"filename", I really meant a 1:1 mapping to a file in /lib/firmware.
My question is, should we have a generic 1:1 mapping and make it  
visible through MODULE_FIRMWARE.
  Or like Jon Masters suggested have specific version numbers in the  
pattern and have them map to specific versions in /lib/firmware and  
make them all visible through MODULE_FIRMWARE.  I believe the  
reasoning behind this was to make packaging drivers easier.
I believe that we should have a generic mapping in the driver (i.e,  
"firmware.bin") and let the admin or the userspace hotplug scripts  
take care of filename policy with a link to the correct firmware  
version.
example :
firmware.bin -> firmware-xyz.bin
The main reason for not including speciic mapping in the driver is  
that everytime a new firmware version is released the driver has to  
be updated and recompiled.  Its much easier to change a hotplug script.
