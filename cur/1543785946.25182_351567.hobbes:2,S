It's not a bug, it's exactly what you're asking for, e.g. "*p1 = *p2" 
translates to memcpy. gcc also can't simply initialize that structure in 
place, e.g. you could do something like this (not necessarily useful but 
still valid): "*p = (struct foo){...,  bar(p),...};".
In the end it all depends on how good gcc can optimize away the memcpy, 
but initially there is always a memcpy.
