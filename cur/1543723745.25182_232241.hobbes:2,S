Could it be possible to combine it with an aligned attribute?
For example HFS has a few structures that need the packed attribute, on 
the other hand all structures are at least on a 16 bit boundary, 
generating byte access is currently overkill there, but splitting 32bit 
accesses into two 16bit accesses would be acceptable.
