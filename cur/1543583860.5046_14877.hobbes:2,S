Does anyone know who proposed these changes as part of
ramfs enhancements? Basically, we have a very similar
operation in XFS, but would like the call to truncatepage
be _before_ the call to block_flushpage(). As far as ramfs
is concerned, such a change would be a no-op since ramfs doesn't
have page->buffers. Is this correct?
thanks,
