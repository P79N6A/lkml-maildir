That probably is a good way.  An alternative might be for the driver
to pass some paramaterized knowledge of the file structure back to
the userland app.  That would prevent the userland app from having
to know as much a priori, but it may be difficult to figure-out how
to describe the media files' structure in a paramaterized way.
YMMV... :-)
