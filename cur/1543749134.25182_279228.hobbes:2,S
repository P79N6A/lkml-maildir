Yep.  This line was moved, but not changed by my patch.  I'll remove the
cast.

Another line that was moved but not changed.  In patch 4/6 I changed it
to dma_map_single(NULL, ...

Again, I didn't change the indentation on this line.  The driver is
replete with whitespace problems.  I don't want to address them now,
but as soon as it's confirmed that these patches are "in the queue",
I'll submit several cosmetic patches:  white space cleanup, rename
from 64340 to 643xx, rename MV_READ/MV_WRITE to mv_read/mv_write,
and a few localized code simplifications.
