It's more the sheer degree of unmaintainability which is grating on my
nerves.  There is way too much hocus-pocus going on, and I dare to say
that probably noone understands what actually happens in there.
In response to the question about what the code looks like, I have put a
development snapshot patch at:
http://userweb.kernel.org/~hpa/setup-snapshot-2007.04.30.patch
Note that it compiles, but it doesn't work yet.  This is not a
submission, just a "what does the code actually look like" sample.
