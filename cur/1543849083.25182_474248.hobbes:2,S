Hmm OK, it could be an issue with the way the iovecs are being walked. Maybe.
I wouldn't have thought that should fire the softlockup detector though.
It could walk a large number of iovec segments (4096) with preempt disabled,
but that's not 10s worth.
And it looks like it is getting stuck in commit_write (but the traces are
a bit wonky, could be some faults happening too).
Do you have CONFIG_DEBUG_VM turned on? (hmm, I notice fault_in_pages_readable
in that case should be have a 2nd argument of seglen rather than bytes, but
that shouldn't be causing your problem)
