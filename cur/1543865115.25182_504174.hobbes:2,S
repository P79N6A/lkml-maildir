I think you may be barking up the wrong tree because IIRC, these 
requests for data beyond the end of the disk never make it to the drive; 
the kernel fails them in the block layer.  There was a patch a while 
back to fix the partition detection code to NOT request sectors beyond 
the end of the disk, but I don't think it was ever merged.
In any case, if you are sure the requests are making it to the drive and 
causing damage, I hope you give Maxtor and IBM a sound thrashing for 
using retarded firmware.
