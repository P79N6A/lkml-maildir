Subject: [PATCH 2.4.0-pre8] Fix RPC over TCP hangs...

Hi Linus,
 It seems that the TCP code has morphed again, breaking the RPC over
tcp write_space() calls. Basically it seems that the current version
of the tcp code no longer allows us to specify that we'd like to wait
until a specific number of bytes are free in the buffer (udp is
unchanged).
The following patch allows us to work with the current TCP
write_space() API by instead reenabling the sending of partial
requests.
Cheers,
  Trond
