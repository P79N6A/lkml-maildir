Not really a crypto expert, but...  use a random session key, at least 
128 bits.  Encrypt _that_ with the passphrase or whatever, eliminating 
any known plaintext.  Since this decryption is only done once at bootup, 
we don't care how slow it may be, so use an iterated scheme (like 
Blowfish crypt).  That way the user could dial it to take 500ms or so on 
the local machine to try a passphrase, making weak passphrases a lot 
harder to bruteforce.  Or the kernel should iteratively encrypt it at 
suspend for some fixed time, then store the iteration count.
So long as suspend/resume is supported, there's a risk that someone 
captures a suspended system and steals a disk image.  Later they force 
the owner to reveal the passphrase.  Now they can see not only the 
useful contents of memory but any old stuff that's been sitting in swap 
since the last reboot (like PGP keys).  This could be avoided by making 
the system somewhat forward-secret: generate a random key per vma and 
zero it out of RAM when the vma goes away (assuming the vma is the right 
unit for it).  If the IVs are chosen based on position in the swap 
device then there should be very little overhead.
