btw you do have a point; should nvidia care if someone patches their
kernel with the -rt patchkit, something which changes many rules inside
the kernel. I'm actually surprised such binary modules work *at all*
given how many of the rules have changed. (For source-compiled modules
it's a bit less of a surprise since the api changes get compiled
through, eg most of the cases the API stayed the same the ABI didn't ,
for binary ones.. that only works if you're lucky I guess. Even for
source modules several needed changes (just look at the -rt patchkit) ).
To some degree, if you use binary modules and experimental patches, you
are on your own; the module vendor is unlikely to care, but so are most
of the developers of the patchkits.. (after all.. there is a good reason
-rt has different rules, that is the whole POINT of the -rt patches,
different rules to achieve the goal of extremely low latencies)
