Hello linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu.
While compiling PHP 3.0.15 on my machine with a 2.3.47(*) kernel, I noticed 
that the configure script failed on sys/resource.h, because the definition
of RLIM_INFINITY in asm/resource.h was redefined in bits/resource.h.
Apparently a definition of RLIM_INFINITY was added to asm/resource.h
sometime in 2.3.x, since it is not there in 2.2.12 at least.
I searched the kernel list archive for any mention of this problem, but
found none, so I just wanted to mention it here.
(*) Looks like it's unchanged in 2.3.51, but I haven't installed that yet.
