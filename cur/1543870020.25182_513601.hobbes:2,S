Please don't document patches like this.
The entirety of your changelog and the Subject: are relative to a patch
which will never hit the mainline git tree.  Put yourself in the position
of someone reading the git changelogs in a year's time.  They're going to
be left scratching their heads at the above, aren't they?
Always include a complete and standalone, not-referential-to-an-old-patch
changelog in each iteration of a patch.
Always choose a suitable Subject:
Yes, it's good to tell us things about how this patch differs from the
previous one.  That info can be placed after the ^--- which comes after
your signed-off-by:, or can be placed at the top of the email, as long as
the full permanent changelog is there too.
Bottom line: you are submitting code and its documentation into the
permanent kernel record, not just the mailing list.  Try to make it
appropriate, thanks.
Please send a new Subject: and changlog for this patch.
