Yes and no. From a legal standpoint you're right. However, we should also 
be polite. If he's the sole author, and he asks for it, I think it's 
reasonable to honor his wishes.
Of course if some new maintainer shows up and decides to infer how the 
device worked by looking at the original open-source code, that's also 
clearly fine.
I don't want people to play lawyer. Honoring peoples rights to the code 
they write is more important than just the law.
