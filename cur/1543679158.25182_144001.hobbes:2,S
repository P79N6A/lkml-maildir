I made a small error when I sent Con a piece of magic I wrote up to help the sleep period.  
what it says right now:
/kernel/sched.c around line 325
sleep_period = (sleep_period *
	17 * sleep_period / ((17 * sleep_period / (5 * tau) + 2) * 5 * tau));
----------------------------------------------------------^
it should be:
sleep_period = (sleep_period *
	17 * sleep_period / ((17 * sleep_period / (5 * tau + 2)) * 5 * tau));
--------------------------------------------------------------^
stupid parenthesis.
a little background.  what this essentially is is a taylor approximation of the function ln(66x+1) normalized.  ln(66x+1) happens to do a great job oas a weighting function on the range of 0 to 1, and because the input only happens to range from 0 to 1, only 2 terms were needed to do a 'good enough' job.
