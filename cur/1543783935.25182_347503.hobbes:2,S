How about 
serial console over a cross-over cable to a second box.
netconsole will let you put the console on a different box over the network.
console on line printer will let you have a permanent record of the
console output on paper.
See
 Documentation/serial-console.txt
 Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt
 the help entry for "config LP_CONSOLE" (in drivers/char/Kconfig)
Would any of those perhaps help you in capturing anything ?
