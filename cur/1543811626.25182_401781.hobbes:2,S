Subject: [patch 09/39] [IPV6]: Address autoconfiguration does not work after device down/up cycle
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
If you set network interface down and up again, the IPv6 address
autoconfiguration does not work. 'ip addr' shows that the link-local
address is in tentative state. We don't even react to periodical router
advertisements.
During NETDEV_DOWN we clear IF_READY, and we don't set it back in
NETDEV_UP. While starting to perform DAD on the link-local address, we
notice that the device is not in IF_READY, and we abort autoconfiguration
process (which would eventually send router solicitations).
