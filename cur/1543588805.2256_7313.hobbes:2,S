You are on the wrong list. You don't modify the kernel to make
a "single-user" machine. You modify the password file in /etc/passwd.
Until you know, and completely understand this, you will be laughed at.
When an interactive process is started, /bin/login gets the new
process information from the /etc/passwd file just before it gets
overwritten (exec) by the shell shown in that same password file.
If you want your accounts to have root privs, you set the UID and
GID fields in the password file to 0 and 0 respectively. I would
not suggest that you connect your computer to a network if you
do this.
