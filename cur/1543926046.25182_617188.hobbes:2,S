Ok, but I was thinking of allowing a more selective approach.  First, break 
out an mm snapshot that only contain patch-sets that are deemed stable, but 
still not ready for rc.  Then, a tool may allow to selectively apply a 
specific patch-set against the latest stable kernel, not the rc.  This could 
possibly improve longer-term testing, instead of just relying on crunch-time 
rc testing.
Thanks!
