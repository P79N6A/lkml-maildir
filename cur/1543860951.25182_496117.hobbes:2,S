Yes I think it should.

OK, but I think that after IO submission, you do not run sync_page to
unplug the block device, like the normal IO path would (via lock_page,
before the explicit plug patches).
However, with explicit plugging, AIO requests will be started immediately.
Maybe this won't be noticable if the device is always busy, but I would
like to know there isn't a regression.

Well I've got some simple per-process batching in there now, each process
has a list of pending requests. Request merging is done locklessly against
the last request added; and submission at unplug time is batched under a
single block device lock.
I'm sure more merging or batching could be done, but also consider that
most programs will not ever make use of any added complexity.
Regarding your patches, I've just had a quick look and have a question --
what do you do about blocking in page reclaim and dirty balancing? Aren't
those major points of blocking with buffered IO? Did your test cases
dirty enough to start writeout or cause a lot of reclaim? (admittedly,
blocking in reclaim will now be much less common since the dirty mapping
accounting).
