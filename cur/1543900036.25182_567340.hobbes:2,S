Ah, I just noticed at the beginning of the patch, and didn't look for
a balancing change - thanks.  I'd strongly recommend that he not mess
around with these numbers, unless there's _very_ good reason: they're
not ideal, nothing ever will be, changing them around just causes pain.
shared_vm may not be a full description of what it counts, but it'll
do until you've a better name (readonly mappings share with the file
even when they're private).
