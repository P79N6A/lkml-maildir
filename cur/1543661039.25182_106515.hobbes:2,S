pgd's and pmd's are in the slab, so the zeroing hit is only taken once
per pgd and pmd (best case). It's my patch that does this.
pfn_to_nid() is surely a random cache and/or ITLB gain from link
ordering, alignment in the final link, or some such nonsense.
pfn_to_nid() is a single shift, quite excessive for a function call.
It'd be best to inline this and get the random ITLB etc. misses out
of the profiles esp. as they aren't reproducible.
