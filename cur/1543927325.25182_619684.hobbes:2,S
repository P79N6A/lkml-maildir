I'm afraid I still can't see the problem. If you want to transfer 9 blocks, then the method by which you do so shouldn't matter. So 9, or 8 + 1 should give the same end result.

Well, the problem is that the abstraction used should work just fine according to how the SDIO standard is defined. The problem seems to be that some card vendors decided to go their own way and started treating the SDIO interface as something other than a simple register interface.
As long as that is the case, there will be a lot of pain supporting these weird cards. We can only debate where to put that pain and what compromises to make.

Yes, as kerneldoc tags for the relevant functions. Have a look in drivers/core/sdio_io.c if you don't want to build the full document.
