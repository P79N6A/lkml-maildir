OK. This is a lot more reasonable. I'm actually looking
into putting non-overcommit as a configurable option in
the kernel.
However, this does not save you from the fact that the
system is essentially deadlocked when nothing can get
more memory and nothing goes away. Non-overcommit won't
give you any extra reliability unless your applications
are very well behaved ... in which case you don't need
non-overcommit.
