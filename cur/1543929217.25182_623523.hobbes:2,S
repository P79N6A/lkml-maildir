..
Note that, much of the time, a single mouse click looks like this:
Event: time 1196621357.073485, type 1 (Key), code 272 (LeftBtn), value 1
Event: time 1196621357.073494, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
Event: time 1196621357.201482, type 1 (Key), code 272 (LeftBtn), value 0
Event: time 1196621357.201492, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
So the first one I posted was probably the same kind of sequence
that leads to the unwanted double-clicks I'm reporting here.
This information may also be relevant:
The mouse is plugged into a USB2 hub, and appears as IRQ19:
 19:      34776          0   IO-APIC-fasteoi   uhci_hcd:usb1, ehci_hcd:usb5
