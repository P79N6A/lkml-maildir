Subject: [patch 23/60] KVM: SVM: Fix FPU leak while emulating clts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

2.6.23-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Amit Shah <amit.shah@qumranet.com>
patch 404fb881b82cf0cf6981832f8d31a7484e4dee81 in mainline.
The clts code didn't use set_cr0 properly, so our lazy FPU
processing wasn't being done by the clts instruction at all.
(this isn't called on Intel as the hardware does the decode for us)
