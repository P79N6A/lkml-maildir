It _did_ fail to mount it, and ext2 _did_ take over: that's why, when
ext2 found something else wrong with the filesystem, the errors
looked like
  EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,20)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not
  in datazone - block = 4294965248, count = 6872
which were marked as ext2 warnings, not ext3 warnings.
Cheers,
 Stephen
