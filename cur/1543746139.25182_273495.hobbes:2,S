Oh, and I think one alternative at this point is obviously to just go back
to the "re-enable all interrupts early in the boot" code. Clearly we need
to do _something_ for 2.6.10, and I want it to be something that is pretty
much equivalent to what we _do_ have testing coverage of. Just to keep
safe.
I actually _like_ the "enable links only when needed" thing, which is why 
I'd prefer to look for alternatives. But I like even more not having to 
worry about strange hw setups, so "minimal fixing" really is pretty 
important.
