this is the point where IMO your argument gets flawed, and where you are
apparently ignoring our arguments. With utmost respect, we *do* care about
what's underneath. The health of what's underneath fueled and fuels the
growth of Linux. I'd like to repeat it again: we cannot optimize for both
the speed of FS driver development (your goal - correct me if i got it
wrong), and long term health of the kernel proper itself (our goal),
because in some areas (such as the inclusion of high complexity debugging
facilities) they do contradict. (mostly they dont contradict) Long term
health has priority - i cannot put it any simpler for you. Anyone who
thinks driver development is the most important for Linux then thats a
pretty shortsighted view IMO.
