At a 3x cache footprint cost? (and probably more than 3x for icache, though
I haven't checked) And I think hardware trends are against us. (Also, does
it have race issues with nested interrupts that Andrew noticed?)

Cool, I'd be interested to see.

The problem is that you can never do the final store without risking a
race with an interrupt. Because it is not a read-path.
The closest think I can see to a seqlock would be ll/sc operations, at
which point you're back to atomic ops.

Yes, it was worth over a second of real time and ~ 7% total kernel
time on kbuild on a P4.

AMD and PM I didn't test but the improvement might still be noticable,
if much smaller.
