	Halleluiah ;)!!!
	Finally, it works as is suposed to do :)))), the load on my dual
PIIIx950 is 0.01 three times and I can mount and umonunt ISOs as much I
wish.
	Thank you very much Jens and all that provided usefull feedback, this
patch alone deserves including in an .acX release.
	And Jens if you ever come to Romania give me a call I owe you a lot of
beers and pizzas :).
