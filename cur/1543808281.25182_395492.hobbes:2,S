I can think of at least 3 ways to at least hide that cosmetic problem
a bit. Won't solve the problem but will make it less likely that most
people will ever encounter it.
(assuming below that we want something like 64bit pids but want to
keep pids at 5 digits as much as possible)
1. When allocating a pid for a new process, always assign the lowest
available free pid.
2. Allocate pid's as we currently do, but once we hit 99999 wrap the
pids and start allocating from free pids starting from 2 and up. only
if no pids below 99999 are free do we continue upwards and allocate
pid 100000.
3. Whenever a process terminates put its pid on a pid_reuse list. When
a new pid needs to be allocated always pick a pid from the pid_reuse
list if any are available, otherwise allocate pids as we currently do.
Any of those 3 scheemes should keep pids below 6 digits as much as
possible. We can still hit the cosmetic problem on boxes where more
than 99999 processes are actually running at the same time, but most
users will never encounter that.
