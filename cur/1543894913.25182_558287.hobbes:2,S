If you share ~crispin/public_html/lookitme by making a hard link,
does relabeling approach work?
I thought SELinux allows only one label for one file.
If AA (on the top of SELinux) tries to allow different permissions to
~crispin/public_html/lookitme and its original location,
either one of two pathnames won't be accessible as intended, will it?
