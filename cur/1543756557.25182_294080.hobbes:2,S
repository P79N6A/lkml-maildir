Neil,
I just set up a new file server a couple of weeks ago, which
holds two RAIDs, making up 4.1 TB each.  I'm not aware of any
distributions that will do the partitioning for you.  I was
able to get the system configured by booting Knoppix and using
parted for the partitioning.  Fedora refused to install on this
system after checking the GPT partition table.  The latest
Mandrake Linux warned me about the partitions, but at least
it accepted going on with the install anyway. lilo is used as
the bootloader and has no problem existing on the MBR of the RAID.
My system is a dual 3.2 GHz Xeon system with 8GB RAM, two
3Ware 9500S RAID controllers, 12 400GB disks pr. RAID controller.
Here's a df from the system:
[root@asaphome ~]# df
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1             7.9G  1.1G  6.8G  14% /
/dev/sda3              14G  3.4G   11G  25% /usr
/dev/sda4             4.0T  232G  3.8T   6% /home
/dev/sdb1             4.1T   24G  4.0T   1% /archive
Good Luck!
Regards Jan Lindheim
