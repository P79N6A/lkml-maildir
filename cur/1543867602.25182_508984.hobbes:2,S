I am still a kernel newbie, and I am still not very much aware about
the GPL vs. Non-GPL drivers debate. I personally think it'd be better
that all drivers should be GPL'd but if that's the case, what would be
the legal position of such vendors as ATI or NVIDIA who supply closed
source drivers? Would it be illegal to use them?
I know this question might sound silly, but as I said before I have
only little awareness about the issue.
