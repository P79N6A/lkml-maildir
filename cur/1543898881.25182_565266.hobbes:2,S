Heh actually I got confused. The requirement that _key is not NULL comes
from the fact that I need to copy it for the workqueue stuff, not from
lockdep. Hence, only _name must be non-NULL, I'll change the comment to
reflect that.

I'll repost with these minor changes directly to akpm tomorrow then; no
lockdep support on my powerbook that I'm using right now so I can't even
compile-test.
