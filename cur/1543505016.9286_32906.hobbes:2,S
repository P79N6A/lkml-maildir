It's been mentioned before under the name "pre-faulting", and I don't
think anyone's tried it yet.  It should only be done for file mappings
that would do clustered readaround and so on -- some device drivers
rely on a single page fault causing just a single page to map at a time
(e.g. windowed x86 framebuffer).
The only problem with pre-faulting is you don't get real faults to tell
you what the process is up to...  but with your ultra-refined readahead
strategy, pre-faulting a cluster would be the final stroke of genius,
no? :-)
On some architectures flush_page_to_ram() might imply some overhead.
Intuitively I'd go for clearing the "accessed" bits on all ptes you fill
in except the one that really faulted.
Conclusion: I don't think you should put it in do_no_page.  Rather,
write a new function preload_page in memory.c, and have filemap_nopage
call that for each page in a cluster that is a cache hit during the
read-ahead scan.
preload_page() should duplicate some of the code in do_no_page(): it
should fill in a pte, but only if the pte is "not present" already, and
the new pte should be marked "old" not "young".  If any memory
allocation is required (for pgds and pmds) it should simply return
without doing the allocation.
Chuck, if your read-ahead code is working could you send me the patch?
thanks,
