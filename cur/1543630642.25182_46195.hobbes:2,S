while we are adding to the wishlist here is a few more items.
Away to make a clone with all files checked out in edit mode. I find
that I always do the checkout anyway and maybe it's possible to make it
faster if it's done at clone time.
Also I have found that it is a pain in the a** to have debug code that I
really don't want to save but it's temporary usefull. When I do a pull
that changes the same file the pull don't work and I have to unedit the
file and lose the debug code or make a needless checkin. I would really
like if it was possible to do a merge that is only in the checkedout
file not stored as a changeset.
