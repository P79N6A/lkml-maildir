Hi
I have a problem with the de2104x module for my Faralon network card. In 
2.4.xx version i could use the tulip driver for this card, but that doesn't 
work anymore for the 2.6.x kernel. So i had to use the de2104x module to get 
the network working. I can not find any error message in the logs though. 
Problem: The network dies when i use programs like tcpdump, snort and 
tethereal. After having used tcpdump, the ping program 'hangs' because it can 
not pump packets through the interface. (also all other networking programs 
don't work then anymore)
What works to get it working again is: 
ifconfig eth0 down
rmmod de2104x
modprobe de2104x 
/etc/init.d/networking restart
I use dhcp to get an ip 
	(i noticed this bug after i changed this interface to use dhcp)
i use Debian (unstable)

As i wrote, i can not find any error message and don't know where to look or 
what to do to point to the exact problem. Nothing to find in /var/log/syslog 
or with the dmesg-program. I'm no programmer and just want to try/test the 
new kernel ... and hope my info can help to solve this problem. Thanx for 
reading. 
Gr.
Richard
