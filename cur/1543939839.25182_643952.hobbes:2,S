Beats me - I don't see it on an 'lspci' ;)  But I'm pretty sure it doesn't
have a 'powerpc' in it, so those threads get *totally* skipped...
My point was "personal interest in the domain" may not be a great way to
tell if a given thread has a stability risk - but I suspect that for the vast
majority of testers like myself who aren't paid to be kernel hackers, if it
isn't something they can trip over on the one or two machines they can easily
test on, it isn't code they're going to review....
(Note that it extends past just hardware too - my config has selinux in it,
so those threads at least *might* get looked at.  cpusets or ocfs2?  If I
read those threads, it's probably by accident... :)
