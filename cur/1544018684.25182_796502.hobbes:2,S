latest -tip is still giving 'make headers_check' warnings:
 usr/include/linux/kvm.h:61: leaks CONFIG_X86 to userspace where it is not valid
 usr/include/linux/kvm.h:64: leaks CONFIG_X86 to userspace where it is not valid
 usr/include/linux/kvm.h:387: leaks CONFIG_X86 to userspace where it
is not valid
 usr/include/linux/kvm.h:391: leaks CONFIG_X86 to userspace where it
is not valid
 usr/include/linux/kvm.h:396: leaks CONFIG_X86 to userspace where it
is not valid
So should I resend my patch or you are going to move this stuff
