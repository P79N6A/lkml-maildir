Subject: [RFC Patch 0/9] Hardware Breakpoint interfaces - v4

Hi All,
	Please find the new set of patches that introduce kernel
interfaces to use Hardware Breakpoint registers and an implementation
for x86 (and x86_64) architecture, now labelled as Version IV.
The patches are based on 2.6.29-rc2 and have been tested to work fine on
x86 architecture. Some of the major changes over the previous version of
patches include:
i) A sample kernel module that uses Data Hardware breakpoint over a
kernel variable to monitor write operations. See
samples/hw_breakpoint/data_breakpoint.c.
ii) Changes in the register_kernel_hw_breakpoint() interface to accept
only one parameter - pointer to a 'hw_breakpoint' structure which will
contain all relevant data members.
Attempts to convert KGDB to use the proposed interfaces is stalled due
to an issue with KGDB (detailed here: 
http://tinyurl.com/aa9agy
) and any
help from its maintainers will be gladly welcomed.
Pending any serious issues/comments, the next revision of patches will
be cleaved of the RFC tag and will be requested for inclusion.
Thanks,
K.Prasad
