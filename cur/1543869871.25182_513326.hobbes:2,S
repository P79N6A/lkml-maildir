Theoretically I could use a mutex. Practically it would trigger ugly
complications. Only the owner can unlock a mutex (for example), so
I could not unlock from an IRQ handler -- not to mention that the
semantic rules outlined in Documentation/mutex-design.txt explicitly
forbid IRQ usage. 
And then, this is what semaphores where designed for, as gates :)
for once that I get to use a semaphore properly...
