My hunch is its because of the vruntime driven preemption which shoots
up latencies (and the fact perhaps that Peter hasnt't focused more on SMP case
yet!).
Curiously, do you observe the same results when in UP mode (maxcpus=1)?

FWIW, my test patch I had sent earlier didnt address the needs of UP, as Peter 
pointed me out. In that direction, I had done more experimentation with the 
patch below, which seemed to improve UP latencies also. Note that I
don't particularly like the first hunk below, perhaps it needs to be
surrounded by an if(something) ..
