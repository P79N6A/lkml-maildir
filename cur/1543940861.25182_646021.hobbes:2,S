Well lets pick one and then stick to it.

How we offload that? Before the scan of the rmaps we do not have the 
mmstruct. So we'd need another notifier_rmap_callback.

The obvious solution does not scale. You will have a callback for every 
page and there may be a million of those if you have a 4GB process.

We need to have a coherent notifier solution that works for multiple 
scenarios. I think a working invalidate_range would also be required for 
KVM. KVM and GRUB are very similar so they should be able to use the same 
mechanisms and we need to properly document how that mechanism is safe. 
Either both take a page refcount or none.
