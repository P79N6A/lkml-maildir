Is this simple approach acceptable?  If so, I'll cleanup and post.
rd.c:rd_init().. undo in rd_cleanup().
443     hardsect_size[MAJOR_NR] = rd_hardsec;     /* Size of the RAM disk blo   444     blksize_size[MAJOR_NR] = rd_blocksizes;      /* Avoid set_blocksize()   445
446     for (i = 0; i < NUM_RAMDISKS; i++) {
447 +       struct block_device *bdev;
448        register_disk(NULL, MKDEV(MAJOR_NR,i), 1, &fd_fops, rd_size<<1);
449 +       bdev = bdget(kdev_t_to_nr(MKDEV(MAJOR_NR,i)));
450 +       atomic_inc(&bdev->bd_openers);  /* avoid invalidate_buffers() */
451     }
