Hmmm... I donnot doubt all is clear in your mind, but the reality with
large software is that they may be modified by numerous guys, and
including some considerations on robustness in the design and
implementation is a good thing in my opinion.

Indeed it does not, but a simple bug that queues something that is already
queued will break everything. The problem with bugs for users is their
actual effect, the opinion of expert programmers that usually excuse
themselves by claiming that every software has bugs is quite irrelevant in
this regard (this applies also to me ;) ).
Note that for the ncr drivers, I donnot expect much people to hack
them, and I donnot apply completely the above recommendations, btw. ;-) 
But, the upper layers of the kernel seems to have a lot more candidates
that hack the same modules.

No thanks needed.
There are some points on which we seem to disagreed ;-), just way of life, 
and flames seem to be the usual consequence of the media we are using for 
discussions.
By the way, despite all the fire spat in the threads, I haven't changed my
mind about the argued topics. :-)
Your page LRU change is something I would have been able or courageous 
enough to implement and I will give it a try. Thanks for having
implemented it.
Gérard.
