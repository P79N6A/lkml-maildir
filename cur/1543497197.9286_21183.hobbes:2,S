	[Greg Smart]  That may be true, but those 16 system calls are
replaced
	with some other interface which is further into user space. Also the
functions
	above look to me like they prevent some access which could
potentially
	cause things to break in a horrible way.  The way I see it, the
smaller the
	kernel is the better, mainly for scalability.
