This is likely a little OT for this thread, but
I probably made that change (of grouping all networking
options and drivers together).  And I still think that they
should all be grouped together -- whether it's under
device drivers or a top-level Networking section.
The real problem AFAICT is that Networking options
includes some protocols and then Network Device Support
includes some other protocols.  Maybe if there was a Network Protocol
section things could be clearer.  ??
