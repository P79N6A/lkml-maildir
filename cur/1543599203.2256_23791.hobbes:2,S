Well, 3C905TX-M here, should be pretty ok, but the NFS failure might
related to the bridge-netfilter-patches. Looks I'd better set up that
box as router rather than a bridge (and just keep a boot floppy that
makes it a bridge around should the disks fail).

2.4.9: up 2 days, 17:55,  1 user,  load average: 0.22, 0.15, 0.06
That box is a lightly loaded SMTP/IMAP/WWW server, no X11R6, user logins
if at all via ssh.
I'll see if 2.4.8-ac12 works for me.
