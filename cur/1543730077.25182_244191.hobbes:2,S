Hi!
No, but that patch is necessary for me to use QoS at all, or the kernel
oopses.
I was refering to that patch for you to know that's not the same
problem. Sorry for not being 100% clear.
If you want to freeze your networking :-) you can do this:
remove pppd (or adjust the ppp0 interface name later)
# killall pppd
# sleep 10
make a fony connection to 1.1.1.2 using /dev/null
#pppd /dev/null connect /bin/true persist demand 1.1.1.1:1.1.1.2
# sleep 1
add a CBQ root to ppp0 (or ppp1, if you didn't killall and have another
running)
# tc qdisc add dev ppp0 root handle 1: cbq avpkt 1000 bandwidth 10mbit
ping the fony remote:
# ping 1.1.1.2
kill pppd
#killall pppd
Now check dmesg, you should get "unregister_netdevice: waiting for ppp0
to become free. Usage count = 1"
Another remark: In single user mode pppd died and system load is 0. In
initlevel 3, pppd eats all my CPU... Don't know why.
Right now I'm testing 2.6.8.1-ck3 (because of that can't-burn-cdrom
thing and other stuff) so the attached /proc/config.gz is somewhat
non-vanilla, but this happens with 2.6.8-rc4-bk1[*] and above.
[*] this version is "bad" and 2.6.8-rc2-bk11 is "good". Didn't test with
rc3...
As you can see in the .config I'm using the OLD POLICER.
As always, please request more info if you need it! :-)
Regards,
Nuno Silva
