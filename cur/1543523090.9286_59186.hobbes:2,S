I invite you to read drivers/cdrom.c and include/linux/cdrom.h.  The
CDROM_SEND_PACKET ioctl has been added to the interface during the 2.3.x
series, and allows you to send arbitrary packets to a low-level cdrom 
driver that supports CDC_GENERIC_PACKET (i.e. ide and scsi).
/me thinks the uniform cdrom driver is very cool, but then I'm biased.
