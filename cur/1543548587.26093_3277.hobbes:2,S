From some random Linux source tree's .hdepend:
/usr/people/ralf/src/linux/linux/include/asm/sn/sn0/ip27.h: \
   /usr/people/ralf/src/linux/linux/include/asm/mipsregs.h \
   /usr/people/ralf/src/linux/linux/include/asm/sn/addrs.h
        @touch /usr/people/ralf/src/linux/linux/include/asm/sn/sn0/ip27.h
/usr/people/ralf/src/linux/linux/include/asm/sn/sn0/arch.h: \
   $(wildcard /usr/people/ralf/src/linux/linux/include/config/sgi/sn0/n/mode.h)
        @touch /usr/people/ralf/src/linux/linux/include/asm/sn/sn0/arch.h
