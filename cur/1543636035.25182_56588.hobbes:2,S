Would you mind to send me 3-4 /proc/meminfos and /proc/cpuinfos
from your Aurora boxes with this patch, preferably after some uptime?
Also, did you think about a deadlock-free runtime resizing of the
nocache memory? I did not even bother with boot-time resizing,
because run-time resizing sounds doable and certainly nobler.
