Thanks for posting transis.  I had a look at the examples and API.  The
API is of course different then openais and focused on client/server
architecture.
I tried a performance test by sending a 64k message, and then receiving
it 10 times with two nodes.  This operation takes about 5 seconds on my
hardware which is 128k/sec.  I was expecting more like 8-10MB/sec.  Is
there anything that can be done to improve the performance?
Thanks

Certainly a different sort of API then openais...
