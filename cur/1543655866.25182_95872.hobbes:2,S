Yeah, ditching patch 5 makes my lvm functional again.  Things are
definately better now.  I haven't attempted to stress it, but the entire
hanging console / zombie process bit has gone away.  Everything appears
to work normally.  A couple test cp's shows nothing abnormal, but
playing an ogg still results in the following.
Dec 12 13:32:20 darwin kernel: bio too big device ide2(33,0) (256 > 255)
Dec 12 13:32:51 darwin last message repeated 3 times
Dec 12 13:33:55 darwin last message repeated 6 times
Any other tests I should do?
