Subject: NFS doen't uniformly copy timestamps to server

I think I first noticed this problem in late December (I wrote a script
to get around it then).  If I attempt to copy the mtime with a file, it
won't get transfered.  But I can set it later.
Within a NFS mount directory:
	cp -a file1 file2	# Timestamp not copied
	mv file1 file2 		# Timestamp not copied
	touch -r file1 file2	# Timestamp copied
I've looked through the man files for mount, exportfs, and exports and I
don't see an option I'm over looking.  An ethereal dump shows the mtime
being sent to the server and the server replying with NFS3_OK and the
correct mtime, but the resulting file does not have the mtime applied.
More data is at:

This currently happens with 2.6.16rc5-git3
Is this a problem with the NFS server or am I applying the wrong options?
