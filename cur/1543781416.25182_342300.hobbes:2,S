If the child is going to exec it may call vfork or clone with CLONE_VM
flag. glibc system(3) does clone (CLONE_PARENT_SETTID | SIGCHLD) why not
CLONE_VM too? This single change will allow to use system() from MPI
programs thus eliminating many users problem. 
If the child isn't going to exec it should face the music.
