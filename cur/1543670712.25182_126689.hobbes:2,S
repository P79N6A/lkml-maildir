1. It should cost at most 4 bytes, in a table of "remove me" address,
with topmost bits of each word used to give the length of the
instruction to remove - i.e. to replace with an optimal nop sequence.
2. Not just locks - a lot of spinlock code could be removed completely.
I don't have an opinion on whether this is worth doing - one can
simply run a UP kernel after all.
