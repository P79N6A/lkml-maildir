Yes, sorry, that comment is _very_ old...

Ok.

No, I had not heard of anyone having any problems with the size of it.
We could just do it like the kobject does, and have a function to set it
and handle the pointer vs. array issue there if you _really_ need a
bigger size.

Oh, that's a very annoying bus id, but I guess it's legal.
I'll poke around and see if I can make it bigger.  You don't want it
bigger for static 'struct device' types, right?
