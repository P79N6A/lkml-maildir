In principle, yes. But implementing it in userland is not responsive
enough doesn't work reliably, while it can actually be implemented in
the serial driver as "acknowledge any CTS upfront" (if the device is not
throttled), and then it works fine. Writing a whole line discipline (and
getting it accepted in the kernel) just for this is a bit overkill.

Yes, of course. But can't this be disabled too? (people won't mind cpu
overhead if they can at least get their device working).
