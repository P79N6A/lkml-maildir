This same discussion is taking place in a few forums.  Are you opposed to
creating a security contact point for the kernel for people to contact
with potential security issues?  This is standard operating procedure
for many projects and complies with RFPolicy.

Right now most things come in via 1) lkml, 2) maintainers, 3) vendor-sec.
It would be nice to have a more centralized place for all of this
information to help track it, make sure things don't fall through
the cracks, and make sure of timely fix and disclosure.
In addition, I think it's worth considering keeping the current stable
kernel version moving forward (point releases ala 2.6.x.y) for critical
(mostly security) bugs.  If nothing else, I can provide a subset of -ac
patches that are only that.
I volunteer to help with _all_ of the above.  It's what I'm here for.
Use me, abuse me ;-)
thanks,
