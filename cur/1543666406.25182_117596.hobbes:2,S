Did you enable "AMD 76x native power management"? Setting CONFIG_AMD_PM768=Y
leads to the results you described for me, among others. (Mainboard is Tyan
S2466, same chipset, AMD-760MPX). Disabling or loading as a module works fine.
Speaking of power: my rig, with 2x Athlon XP 2000+, 1GB of ram, a GF2 GTS and
two hds, draws about 190 watts under full load, somewhat more when the
optical drives are active. But the most I ever registered was 211W (at the
mains level, typical PSU efficiency is around 70%, iirc).
