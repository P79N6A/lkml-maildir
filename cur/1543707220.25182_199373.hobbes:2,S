Subject: Still have build error on 2.6.2 fc/proc/array.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Thanks for everyone that replied!
Based on README and requirement of Changes in linux-2.6.2, I have updated needed utilities and other files with the following:
binnutils 2.14
e2fsprogs-1.34
module-init-tools-3.0-pre10
procps 3.1.15
Everything is installed OK.
Then compiling new 2.6.2 kernel still fails wi the following.  What is the upgrade file for this problem?
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      fs/proc/array.o
fs/proc/array.c: In function `proc_pid_stat':

                    ] 
                    [

                    ]  ("include/linux/times.h") 38))

                    ] 
                    [ 
                        (asm_input:DI ("A"))
                    ]  ("include/linux/times.h") 38))

            (clobber (reg:QI 18 fpsr))
            (clobber (reg:QI 17 flags))
        ] ) -1 (insn_list 721 (nil))
    (nil))
fs/proc/array.c:398: confused by earlier errors, bailing out
make[2]: *** [fs/proc/array.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [fs/proc] Error 2
make: *** [fs] Error 2
Many thanks!
