Be sure to add notes about why NOT to add new system calls, ioctls, /proc
entries, etc.  It seems that the popular way to communicate to the kernel
these days is to be able to read/write data to the kernel device driver
via opening a device, or exporting a pseudo filesystem with information.

Check out kernelnewbies.org as well, no point in re-inventing the wheel.
