Greetings;
I've just tried to burn a dvd iso 4 times, 2 different brands of disks,
getting an identical but bad md5sum for all 4 writes.
K3B reports it has written 1160 or 1163 Mbytes each time, but doesn't
seem to have a problem with that.
Kernel is 2.6.14.2, without packet writing for cd/dvd turned on, but I
have one with it enabled building now.  K3B is 0.11.13, cdrecord is
2.1(dvd), groisofs is 5.21, mkisofs is 2.1-a34.  The drive is a Lite-On
DVDRW SOHW-1673S.
Has anyone else encountered a similar problem?  I've been making
good cd's all along with no problems, in this new drive, till now.
