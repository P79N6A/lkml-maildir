Alan Cox and others have publicly stated that drivers, if complied stand 
alone with NO DEPENDENCIES ON KERNEL HEADERS (i.e. they do not 
incorporate in any way any kernel headers or source code tagged GPL) do 
not violate the GPL when provided with Linux. DSFS, NVidia, and several 
folks build kernel modules which are stand alone and are not objected to 
by the majority of folks.
If these drivers include kernel headers as part of the build, then the 
drivers violate the GPL. Period. Check the code. If the vendor is 
including **ANY** GPL kernel headers, then they are required to open 
source the drivers. There are some zealots and GPL bigots that disagree 
with this, but Linux folks seem to be reasonable on this point.
