I want ixp4xx_ prefix in module name, otherwise I'd call it npe.c,
sure.

Why? Especially with code having to work with third party binary-only
firmware? Suicide. They are eliminated at build time = performance
hit (OTOH this file isn't on any fast path).

It's actually not only a matter of taste, they are private
to the .c file and I don't want to make them available to the
public (but sure, I don't like them in .c either, I think nobody
likes such definitions anywhere but they have to exist somewhere).
