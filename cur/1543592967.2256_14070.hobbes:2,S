There are two ways to get nulls in log files.  reiserfs bugs, and a crash
before data blocks are flushed to disk.  You've probably hit the second.
Reiserfs only logs metadata, so it is possible for newly allocated data
blocks to have null bytes after a crash.
Patches are in progress to flush new data blocks before transaction commit.
I'm about to send out the first building block for this...
