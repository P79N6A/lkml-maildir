yes, passivetex (which is used by xmlto to process XML-FO) is not as
stable as I thought.
It breaks at strange times but I did not yet had the energy to really
look into it.
So we probably have to support db2pdf/ps again.

you should be able to put the following lines into stylesheet.xsl:
<param name="paper.width">6in</param>
<param name="paper.height">11in</param>
would it be easy enough if I provided some commented out entries?
(well the above only works for xmlto, I don't know how to set
the paper size for db2*)

you can insert graphics with
<mediaobject><imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="blah.png" format="PNG"/>
</imageobject></mediaobject>
(See 
http://www.faqs.org/docs/docbook/html/mediaobject.html
)
The above generates an <img src="blah.png"> in HTML mode.
Is that what you want?
