There is also a goof-ball I just had pointed out to me in the hpt366.c
code.
In function "static int hpt366_tune_chipset (ide_drive_t *drive, byte speed)"
- byte regtime            = (drive->select.b.unit & 0x01) ? 0x43 : 0x40;
+ byte regtime            = (drive->select.b.unit & 0x01) ? 0x44 : 0x40;
A typo that basically destroys the timing setup based on the busclock;
however, it does sometime recover in the end.....
