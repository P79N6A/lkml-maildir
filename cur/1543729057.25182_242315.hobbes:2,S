> What driver are you using for the PERC?
Megaraid "2". As far as I know, in newer kernels, this is the only one
compiled in. We have had several problems with the previous one. Also, Matt
Domsch's page state the exact versions you need depending on your system.
Our 1750's work very well using RAID PERC4/DI under 2.4.26's megaraid
driver. Although they are not really stressed ...
> I've been wanting to try the 'megaraid2' driver
Hopefully, Matt will send his advice on the subject, but I think you should
try this asap.
Sylvain.
