Sorry, I wasn't very clear.  As far as I know, the specific ext2 bug
(race on up to date flag of newly allocated metadata) was found/fixed
by Al.  
The issues left are just dump getting inconsistent backups from
a rw mounted disk.  We'll have this bug regardless of page cache vs buffer
cache vs raw io in dump.
Now, what's interesting is the raw io dump + ext3 case.
