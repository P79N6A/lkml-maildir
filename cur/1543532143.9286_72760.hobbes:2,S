Ah, OK. So we have CLONE_PARENT now. Fine. That still leaves the fun
problems with POSIX signal semantics. Someone developed a patch for a
new kind of process grouping that could be used for this, but it never
seems to have made it into the kernel. Both Larry and I were quite
excited about this scheme, because it wasn't POSIX specific, but was
generally useful. It was a clean approach that could be used by
libpthread as well.
