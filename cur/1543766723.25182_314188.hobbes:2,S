Certainly not different in the overall numbers, but after trying gzip on 
a bunch of various source files on 32 bit CPUs, from P-II to Xeon, it 
looks as if after 7 the cpu jumps about 40% to 8, and another 30% to 9. 
Neither 8 nor 9 give any significant size improvement (< 2%).
Again, this is 32 bit CPU and just the gzip component, reading from 
stdin and writing to stdout which I hope gets directory operations out 
of the time measure.
Sample attached.
