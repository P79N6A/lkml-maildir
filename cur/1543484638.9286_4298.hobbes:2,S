And CMU users --- we use a derivative of Derek's port maintained by Jeff

Keep in mind also:  if such a change is *needed* (e.g. security fix or a
POSIX compatibility issue that can't be accomplished any other way), it
should be made.  But there should be some thought about whether the change
is really needed now, or if it can wait for the next stable version.
