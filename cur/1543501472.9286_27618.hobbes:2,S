I've never applied the ac patches so I thought I'd give it a
shot. I applied the patch ok, or it seemed okay anyway, but when I try
to do a make xconfig I get the following:
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
make -C scripts kconfig.tk
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/local/src/linux-2.2.10.ac6/scripts'
cat header.tk >> ./kconfig.tk
./tkparse < ../arch/i386/config.in >> kconfig.tk
drivers/char/Config.in: 170: can't handle dep_tristate condition
make[1]: *** [kconfig.tk] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/linux-2.2.10.ac6/scripts'
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
Is this a deficiency in my Tcl/Tk, or did I screw something up in
applying the patch or something else? Sorry if this is FAQ'd someplace
but I couldn't find it in any obvious place.
The make xconfig works fine on my pure 2.2.10 source tree, BTW.
Thanks,
Gary
