Subject: Using NFS from dosemu

When I use linux-2.2.13, linux sometimes behaves strange, when accessing files
on an NFS mount from a program running inside dosemu.
What happens is that I get the following message in the log:
Oct 22 13:27:55 x kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 192.168.73.37
And then nothing happens for a short while, and then this starts flooding the
log:
Oct 22 13:28:31 x kernel: ask to queue: error: -11!
Oct 22 13:28:31 x kernel: lockd: couldn't bind to server 192.168.73.37 - retrying.
Oct 22 13:28:31 x kernel: RPC: doubly enqueued task!
Oct 22 13:28:31 x kernel: RPC: failed to add task to queue: error: -11!
Oct 22 13:28:31 x kernel: lockd: couldn't bind to server 192.168.73.37 - retrying.

The machine is then unusable until I kill dosemu with Alt-SysRq-K.
The server is a RedHat 5.2 system upgraded to kernel 2.2.5.
I never saw this behaviour with 2.2.12.
