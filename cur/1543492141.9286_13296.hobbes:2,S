That's not the common case, though - the first things that get converted to 
use capabilities will surely be the existing suid stuff, won't they? 
Are you suggesting that the whole system should break when you reboot to an old
kernel?
What wrong with sticking
 if (geteuid() == 0 && getuid() != 0) exit(1);
in your new capability-aware utilities if it's so important to avoid suid
operation on old kernels?
A lot of people are going to want to remove the suid bit from existing 
executables and add capabilities. If that then breaks when they reboot to an 
old kernel, then we've done something blatantly wrong. Using the suid bit as a 
marker to show the presence of a 'capability header' seems like an ideal 
solution, because it provides backwards compatibility without any loss of 
security in relation to the _existing_ situation. New capability-holding 
utilities that were never suid and should never be suid can just include that 
one-liner I gave above.
