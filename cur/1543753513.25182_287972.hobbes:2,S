I think you are going to regret making splice() a system call, it shouldn't
be, you'll find cases where it won't work.  Make it a library call built
out of pull() and push(), see my original postings on this and you'll
follow the logic.  Making splice a system call is like putting ftp 
into the kernel, not a good idea.
