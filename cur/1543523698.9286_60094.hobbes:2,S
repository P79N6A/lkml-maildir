well, it locked again, but this time I had an strace:
lstat("tcheck", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0
getdents(6, /* 0 entries */, 3933)      = 0
close(6)                                = 0
open("tcheck", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_DIRECTORY) = 6
fstat(6, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0
fcntl(6, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
fchdir(6)                               = 0
getdents(6, /* 6 entries */, 3933)      = 112
lstat("lost+found", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=12288, ...}) = 0
lstat("tripwire", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=300572, ...}) = 0
lstat("tw.config", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=426, ...}) = 0
lstat("databases", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0
getdents(6, /* 0 entries */, 3933)      = 0
close(6)                                = 0
open("lost+found", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_DIRECTORY) = 6
fstat(6, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=12288, ...}) = 0
fcntl(6, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
fchdir(6)                               = 0
getdents(6, /* 2 entries */, 3933)      = 28
I have a floppy I mount (read only) on my machine that has tripwire on
it, and I run it every night or when I feel like it. ;) 
Apparently that floppy is hosed! Any attempt to access the lost+found
dir on there leaves the thing that tried it in disk wait on
wait_on_buffer.
This could be a bug in the floppy driver, or (more likey) the floppy
disk itself is just messed up. Shouldn't the floppy driver timeout the
request if it can't read it in a few seconds? 
at least we can rule out the MM system, and I now know whats causing
my problems. ;)
