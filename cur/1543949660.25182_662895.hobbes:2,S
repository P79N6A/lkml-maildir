No it couldn't.
That would only be true if there is no cache, and no cache coherency.
Basically, Linux requires a cache-coherent architecture to work in SMP. 
Anything else is insane (except as a cluster).
So there is no way we can see partial updates, except with terminally 
broken hardware that we would never support anyway for tons of other 
reasons.
