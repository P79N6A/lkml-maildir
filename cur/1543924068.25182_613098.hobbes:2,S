Sorry, for a bit late response,
Do you meant that EHCI driver triggers the resume regardless of the above commit?
Now I have checked the source and understand that the above commit is 150% right.
(Actually I always assumed that it was always there, and some developers did that too)
I assumed that on hibernation the sequence is:
.suspend() - disable device + enable wake
snapshot
.resume() - enabled device + disable wake
snapshot writeout
.suspend() - disable device + enable wake
But before the above commit was introduced, the last .suspend()
didn't happen, and thus all the code that enables wake was disabled.
For the same reason rtc-cmos didn't work, since its .resume disables the alarm.
The mystery why my system did react to WOL in S4 is resolved by the fact that
e1000 .shutdown() calls .suspend() to make WOL work in S5 too.
(Btw, this is wrong that rtc-cmos disables alarm in .shutdown()  since it can be used in S5 too)
So, this commit caused the EHCI .suspend to activate the wakeup, and this code probably contains a bug
(Or a lack of hardware workaround)
Thus, since the suspend to ram isn't affected by the above commit, I want to know
whenever it affects the system you have seen resuming from ram instantly with ehci driver.
