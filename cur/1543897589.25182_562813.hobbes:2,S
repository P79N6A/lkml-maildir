I tend to disagree, but if any screaming users show up, we can certainly 
think about adding some.
Such would be a diagnostic that would trigger on valid SCSI commands, 
when the user is doing nothing wrong and the system can indeed complete 
the command just fine.  Additionally, this is moving us in the direction 
of what the IDE driver has apparently been doing.
