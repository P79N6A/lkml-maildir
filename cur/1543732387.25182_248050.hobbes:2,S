I think there is, too.
I also wonder what happens if the first read of a sysfs file is not at
offset zero (eg: pread()):
static ssize_t
sysfs_read_file(struct file *file, char __user *buf, size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
	struct sysfs_buffer * buffer = file->private_data;
	ssize_t retval = 0;
	if (!*ppos) {
		if ((retval = fill_read_buffer(file->f_dentry,buffer)))
we seem to not allocate the buffer at all?
