This would probably explain why I've never heard of them. In my brief
perusal of the MSDN Library in search of more information about these
beasts, the only hint I could find related to their existence is in
parameters to ZwCreateFile/NtCreateFile (which are themselves mostly
undocumented). The high level file API certainly doesn't support their
use, AFAICT.
I think it's reasonably safe to assume that hpa's worry that FAT might
get EAs in the future is unfounded. (Named streams is still a
possibility, but I don't think Microsoft is all that interested in
making improvements to a filesystem that people use so that they don't
have to license NTFS.)

Good luck with that.
