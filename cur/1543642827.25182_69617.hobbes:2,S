No. We can't make this kind of change to the way the vmalloc region works on
some architectures only. It has to remain uniform.
Either it's worth doing for all, or it's not. It's a fairly trivial change
in the slow path, after all. I suspect it's worth it -- I'll ask the same 
question again with a patch attached as soon as I get time, in order to 
elicit more responses.
