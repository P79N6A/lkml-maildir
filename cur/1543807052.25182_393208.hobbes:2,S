I use it on a daily basis.  It works.

Yes.

The suspending helper should not use mounted filesystems after it
calls the atomic snapshot ioctl().  The resuming helper should be run from
an initrd and all filesystems should be unmounted at that time (of course
it should not attempt to mount them).
Please read the Documentation/power/userland-swsusp.txt file in the latest -mm
and you'll get an idea of how it works.

After.

Yes, it will, as long as the helpers follow some strict rules (above).

That doesn't matter.

Not necessarily.  For example, if you suspend the box and then start it with
a wrong kernel that is unable to read the image, it will mount the file
systems and you loose the saved state.
