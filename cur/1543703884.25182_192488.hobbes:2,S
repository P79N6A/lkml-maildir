Ah-hah!  That's why the ppc64 kbuild system is whining about undefined but
used i2c symbols:
drivers/ieee1394/Kconfig:60:warning: enable is only allowed with boolean and tristate symbols
drivers/media/video/Kconfig:13:warning: enable is only allowed with boolean and tristate symbols
So this change needs to be propagated to other architectures as well.
