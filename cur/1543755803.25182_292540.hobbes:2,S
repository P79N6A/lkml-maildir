This is true if CPU 0 reads the count before reading skb->list.
Without a memory barrier, atomic_read and reading skb->list can
be reordered.  Put it another way, reading skb->list could return
a cached value that was read from the main memory prior to the
atomic_read.
So in order for CPU 0 to always see an up-to-date value of skb->list,
it needs to do an smp_rmb() between the atomic_read and reading
skb->list.
