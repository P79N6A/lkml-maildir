Hi follows,
I'm getting in troubles with a A7M266-D motherboard with two
Athlon XP 1800 cpus (yes, XP not MP!).
Following the screen shot of my problem:
^-------cut here---------^
EIP:    0010:[<c0111686>]    Not tainted
EFLAGS: 00011046
<4>CPU:    1
<4>CPU:    1
EIP:    0010:[<c0111686>]    Not tainted
EFLAGS:  00011046
 `u!wisuu`m aeesess 7eg111eg
 printing eip:
 printing eip:
*pde = 11111010
Stuck ??
CPU #1 not responding - cannot use it.
Error: only one processor found.
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
Setting 2 in the phys_id_present_map
...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 2 ... ok.
init IO_APIC IRQs
 IO-APIC (apicid-pin) 2-10, 2-11, 2-12, 2-13, 2-16, 2-17, 2-20, 2-21, 2-22, 
2-23 not connected.
..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=2 pin2=0
^-----cut here-----^
After spend some times put printk's in kernel source like "Reach this point!"
I was trying disable IO_APIC in .config file but some link erros ocurred. 
Has any way to turn IO_APIC disable? Or its extreme necessary?
Thanks,
Ricardo.
