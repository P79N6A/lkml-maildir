Sometime around test10 or test11 unmap left vm_operations_struct.  The
comment implies its there but it's gone.  Where did it go? 
How do I get a call back for a page unmap?
I ran into this while hacking the Nvidia kernel driver to work with
2.4.0.  I got the driver working but it's not 100%
Also where did get_module_symbol() and put_module_symbol() go?
