Yes, but we can't break existing code that has been working for quite
some time.  That's just unacceptable.  The i2c devices can fix things by
changing their module names so this collision doesn't happen :)
So, I'm all for reverting this patch.
And then, feel free to revisit the problem by proposing something that
doesn't break existing users of the interface.
Michael, can you please send me a patch, and CC: stable@kernel.org so we
make sure to get this into 2.6.24.1?
thanks,
