Actually, I may not have been very clear in my Use-Case composer description 
to mean internal in-kernel Use-Case composer as opposed to external Userland 
Use-Case composer.
So, nbd+dm+raid1 would be an external Userland Use-Case composition, which 
obviously could have some drastic performance issues.
DRBD and ZFS are examples of internal in-kernel Use-Case composers, which 
obviously could show some drastic performance improvements.  
Although you could allow in-kernel Use-Case composers to be run on top of 
Userland Use-Case composers, that wouldn't be the preferred mode of 
operation.  Instead, you would for example recompose ZFS to incorporate an 
in-kernel distributed storage layer component, like nbd.
All this boils down to refactoring Use-Case composers to produce layer 
components with both in-kernel and userland interfaces.  Once we have that, 
it becomes a matter of plug-and-play to produce something awesome like ZFS.
Thanks!
