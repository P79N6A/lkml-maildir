I missed commenting on this first time round.  What is the purpose behind
this idea?
Currently, sysfs attributes are generally static structures which don't
require allocation, and are shared between all objects.  I'm unable to
see what advantage adding this void pointer is supposed to give us,
other than having to dynamically allocate these structures if we want
to use them.
What's more, I don't really see what adding this buys us - we already
have the pointer which is supposed to identify the object passed in.
There's another question - how is the lifetime of the object pointed
to by this void pointer managed?
