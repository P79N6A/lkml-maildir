Subject: problem with "Gadget filesystem" config prompt (bk10)

  just doing a "make oldconfig", from bk9 -> bk10, being prompted for the
USB_GADGETFS (Gadget filesystem), which asks
  ... [N/m/?]  (NEW)
without thinking, i typed "y" (not noticing that that was not a valid
answer), and what i got back was:
Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
dynamically linked module called "gadgetfs".
  which suggests that "y" *is* a valid response (when clearly it isn't).  
someone might want to clarify this.
