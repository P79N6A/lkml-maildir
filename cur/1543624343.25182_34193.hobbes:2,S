Good example. (I even implemented something of that sort for downloading
new firmware for Maxtor SCSI drives back when the 1G Panther was a brandy
spanky new thing. I never distributed it and have no plans of doing so.
Amigans as a rule are not good candidates for having such code on hand. The
average Linux SysAdmin should be a few dB smarter and more careful. I don't
think it would be a good thing to force multiple reboots in the situation
you cite. And it does happen.)
