Would not that be good in either case? (I.e. even beyond i386)
Discarding __exit at the linking stage for CONFIG_MODULES=n kernels
sounds really good, because it reduces the time to _load_ the kernel.
Think TFTP. Particularly SPARC OBPs (I've seen E250 and E10K do that)
do TFTP transfers like an old granny ... You wait roughly two minutes
for common Aurora and Debian images (around 6 to 7 MB) - to get the
picture. I am grateful for every kilobyte images can lose.
