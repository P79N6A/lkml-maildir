I am not privy to that kind of information.  SGI has always
maintained and supported systems with more than 1 IO Chipset on
the same system.  So, we will have SHUB/PIC and TIO IO
Chipset on the same system once TIO goes into production.

All I am saying is that we have an effort going towards that direction.  I
am trying to work with you, letting you know ahead of time what is coming
down so that future effort you are expanding is not wasted.

I am not out to prove you right or wrong - that is irrelevent.  We are not moving
code to Prom, we are enhancing our current functionality in Prom so that
we will not need these code in the Linux kernel anymore.  Prom already
has most of these functionalities.

I will have a problem, if SGI is not the maintainer of our IO Chipset code for
ia64/Altix.  When this is done, there will be very little kernel code left
to be maintained anyway.  It will make life much better for us all, as we can
concentrate on other parts of the kernel.
I believe we have beaten this topic to death now.  You know what we are trying
to accomplish - that is to follow as closely as possible the current methodology
ia32/ia64 platforms are using for platform initialization - in System BIOS and
ACPI.  This will enable us to yank a tremendous amount of code from the
kernel, making sn2 only and also Generic ia64 kernel much smaller, and the
sn2 platform specific code much easier to maintain and understand.
It would have been very rude of us, not to inform you of our plans, given the fact
that you have shared your intention.  That would just waste your time.
Thanks.
