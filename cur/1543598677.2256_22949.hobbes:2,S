So we then have two options, one of which is required if we are going to be able
to get any random numbers from this box:
1) if we contact some server to boot or to mount filesystems, we can also slurp
up some seed values from that server.
2) we enable all NIC drivers to collect entropy
In the case you describe, I don't see any other options.  Without one of these
paths, /dev/random will block, and /dev/urandom will be predictable.
