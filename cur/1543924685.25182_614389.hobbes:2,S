I'm sorry I missed this when it was posted.
Unfortunately this protocol doesn't suit booting paravirtualized under
Xen.  There are two problems:
   1. Xen will always boot with paging enabled; it's simply not possible
      to do otherwise, since it uses paging to protect guests from each
      other.  This would need to be amended to allow paging to be
      enabled, with an initial default pagetable.  Presumably an
      identity mapping pagetable would be preferred, but the question of
      how much to map comes up, and where the pagetable lives in the
      kernel's address space.
   2. Also, Xen reserves the last chunk of the GDT for its own
      descriptors, and by default boots the guest with the segment
      registers preloaded with selectors pointing to flat 4G descriptors
      in this range.  These segments are not a full 4G, since it uses
      segment limits to protect the hypervisor from guests.  The limits
      are as large as they can possibly be.  I like to see the boot
      protocol require that all segments registers are preloaded with
      large flat 32-bit descriptors, but not require a specific selector
      value.  I'd happy to require the GDT to be active, so the segment
      registers can be reloaded with their current values, until the
      kernel establishes its own GDT.
