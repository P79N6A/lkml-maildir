Subject: fs corruption with pre-2.3.9-5 + this little patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I think I finally spotted the problem in my tree that was causing fs
corruption.
With only this little patch applyed to pre-2.3.9-5 I corrupted completly
my test-machine only by running a memory hog + bonnie at the same time.
(now I am reinstalling linux on such machine...).
The other nice thing is that without this little patch the page-LRU code
never failed in 20/30 minutes (and I also just prepared a patch with only
the LRU code for pre-2.3.9-5 :).
Well I attach here the alone patch that triggers fs corruption running
bonnie and a memory hog at the same time on pre-2.3.9-5.
patch against pre-2.3.9-5, NOTE: the interesting part is only buffer.c,
review the other part as well of course, but the genhd is only to avoid
lilo to oops in ll_rw_block (no Alloced block), and the ll_rw_block part
is there _only_ if you use more than one blockdevice in write mode (I
could as well ignore it here).

Now I ask you if you see a bug in the above patch. I would be very happy
if you could find a bug in it. But if you can't see bugs then I think it
would be better to merge it in the stock tree in order to give light to
the bug.
Note: with the patch - since there isn't aging in the buffer cache - in a
clean pre-2.3.9-5 then the ll_rw_block can be run over a _fresh_
dirty-buffer (far more fresh then the the one at the end of the dirty lru
list). Maybe another way to corrupt the fs is to start syncing young
buffers in the lru list? I have no idea if that can be the reason of the
problem though. I also reviewed the get_block ext2 path and I can't see
anything obvious wrong there.
I am also using the above patch in 2.2.10 in my andrea-VM patches and it
always worked like a charm in 2.2.x (no one bug report so far while lots
of people is using it, me included). I never had fs corruption with my
andrea-VM patches so far and I am using it all the time now that I can't
run 2.3.x on my fast-machine where I don't want to risk to reinstall
everything :). If I would have the test-machine just running (now is in
the middle of mke2fs :), I would have just added the down(&i_sem) around
get_block in the write-helper-functions in buffer.c, to see if I can
trigger fs corruption such way as well.
As last thing (patch details) ll_rw_block(WRITEA) should be not allowed to
sleep so there should be no risk to have two shrink_mmap trying to free
the same buffer at the same time. (but even if WRITEA would sleep my LRU
code can handle two SMP parallel shrink_mmap at the same time, so it
wouldn't be a problem here)
I also checked that there isn't corruption due stack overflow due
ll_rw_block called too much nested into the stack.
Also note that everything seems stable (it doesn't look as a mm
corruption) only ext2 complains and trashes away.
Exactly the program I am using to leak memory is this:
main()
{
	char *p[50];
	int i, j;
	for (j=0; j<50; j++)
	{
		p[j] = (char *) malloc(1000000);
	}
	for (;;)
		for (j=0; j<50; j++)
		{
			for (i=0; i<1000000; i++)
				p[j][i] = 0;
		}
}
The test-machine has 32mbyte of RAM and 70mbyte of swap so it swapout
continously around 20/30mbyte of data.
Then I run in background a bonnie loop:
	while :; do bonnie ; done &
After 10/20 minutes the fs start complaining, remount in read-only mode
and if I am in luck I can boot without mke2fs after that :).
Comments are appreciated.
Andrea
PS. I would be happy also if you could try the patch on a test-machine and
confirm that you can trask the fs this way.
PPS. My next step are to try to reproduce with the inode semaphore held
and then to check that my new SMP-threaded LRU code is safe and unrelated
with the fs problems I had since 2.3.7.
