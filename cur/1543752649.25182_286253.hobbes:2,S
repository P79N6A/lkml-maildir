The smbfs breakage depended on what server you were using it seemed.
For a lot of folks it broke horribly.

There are number of XFS related issues in Red Hat bugzilla.
As its not something we actively support, they've not got a lot

so may already have got fixed.
We've also seen a few reports on Fedora mailing lists.
