i've added an infrastructure for easy softirq lock-break and preemption 
to the -H9 version of the voluntary-preempt patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8-rc2-H9
in -H9 i've fixed the most important softirq latency sources:
 - the RCU code
  this one is new and is really bad - it can literally execute tens of
  thousands of d_callback() functions within rcu_do_batch() causing
  millisecs of delays - e.g. triggered by the 'du /' test on a box with
  enough RAM. It affects UP just as much as SMP, in both preempt and 
  non-preempt mode as well.
 - the timer code
  no real latencies in practice but in theory if enough timers are set 
  to fire in the same jiffy it could be easily unbound.
 - net TX/RX code
  being the worst offender this had some throttling code already but it 
  didnt listen to resched requests. It does now.
it is really easy to do lock-break of softirqs, one only has to find a
place where it's safe to enable softirq processing and do a
cond_resched_softirq() call.
