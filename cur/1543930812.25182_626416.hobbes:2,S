Exactly.  You think it's 2us, but the documentation doesn't say.  The _p 
functions are generic inasmuch as they provide an unspecified delay.  
Drivers which work across platforms, and which use _p, therefore have 
different delays on different platforms.  Should the length of the delay 
be unimportant?  I wouldn't have thought so.  If it is important, does 
that mean that such drivers are buggy on some platforms?
I really *hate* the idea that access to non-present hardware is used to 
generate a delay.  That sucks so badly.  It's worthy of a school-aged 
hacker, not of a world-leading operating system.  It's so not 
best-practice that it's worst-practice.
