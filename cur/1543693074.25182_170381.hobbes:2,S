But the problem is not only repetitive zeros are not reported but also that
transition from non-zero to zero delta is not reported either.
OK, since you telling me there are devices which never stop generating 
events we could go the way absolute events done and suppress repeated data.
Should I try that? 
As far as application goes it was my modified version of GPM - pretty much
every other event is not repeated unless changed so I did not reset the
internal state and expected get an event telling me the last delta. I am
OK with data not being repeated but I want to get event for transition
to 0.
