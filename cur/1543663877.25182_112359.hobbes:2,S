Could be that concurrent umount isn't a good way of getting scalable
writeout; I can't say that I've ever looked...
Could you try putting a `sync' in there somewhere?
Or even better, throw away dd and use write-and-fsync from ext3 CVS.  Give it
the -f flag to force an fsync against each file as it is closed.
