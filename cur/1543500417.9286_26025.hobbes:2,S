In porting a mixed user/kernel driver for a PCI BusMastering device,
after some struggle and a look to the sound driver, I realized that
PG_reserved is necessary in kernel memory which has to be mapped from
within user space as in:
    kvaddr = kmalloc(size, ...) // where size is n*PAGE_SIZE
    ...
    {
    void*         adr= kvaddr;
    unsigned long page;
    unsigned int  sz = size;
    while (sz > 0) 
      {
	mem_map_reserve(MAP_NR(adr));
	adr += PAGE_SIZE;
	sz  -= PAGE_SIZE;
      }
    }
what is the sense of the comment in include/linux/mm.h ?
/*
 * Various page->flags bits:
 *
 * PG_reserved is set for a page which must never be accessed (which
 * may not even be present).
 *
...
"which must never be accessed" refers to the I/O subsystem, doesn't it ?
or to generically to code instructions ?
I'm curious, what is that bit for ? 
I experimented the effect: user space doesn't see any modification made
from kernel code or PCI DMA access.
ciao
