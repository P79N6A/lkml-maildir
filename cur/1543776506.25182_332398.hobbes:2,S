Only because it's using a facility that's supposed to be for enumerated 
types for something that isn't.  If it were a true enumerated type, the 
codes for the enumerations (0x01, 0x02) would be quite arbitrary, whereas 
here they must fundamentally be integers whose pure binary cipher has 
exactly one 1 bit (because, as I understand it, these are used as bitmasks 
somewhere).
I can see that this paradigm has practical advantages over using macros 
(or a middle ground - integer constants), but only as a byproduct of what 
the construct is really for.
