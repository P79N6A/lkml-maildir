On a cluster, if we have linuxbios (I admit that's still 'if')
- boot the kernel from NVRAM
- Kernel gets boot command line stuff via dhcp
- kernel follows orders from commmand line and either:
  keeps going (it's the kernel we want)
  boots from disk
  boots from some other way via the net (even NFS is possible)

For this generation of motherboard there's a hard 1 MB limit. Also the
intel flasher software is odd about how much of that 1MB it's willing to
program, so the limit is more like 512K until Intel divulges the Secret
Bit that would let devbios write flash ram (this is hidden info on the
l440gx+, and Intel support has already told me that (1), it's secret, and
(2), they don't want to tell me the secret). 
That said, long term I have no problem with the user-mode approach, but in
terms of what we need here the direct kernel approach is probably more
useful.
