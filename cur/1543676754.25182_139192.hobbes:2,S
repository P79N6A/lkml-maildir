Ok. To speed up the tests I  call it "ok" if there are no verify errors within
70 GB and "fail" if there are one or more.
I have tried rc7+aic20030603 SMP with noapic and it is ok.
/proc/interrupts:

Reading around the whole interrupt stuff I came across a very simple idea which
I am going to test right now. See you in some hours ;-)
