ya, AFAIK ext2-writepage/s and ext2-readpage/s are the functions
actually dealing with the file data and you can also see
generic_file_write/read assigned to the fields in ext2_file_operations
variable because they also deals with the file data ...

I think at the lower-level you can deal with the block-layer but at
this layer AFAIK you won't be able to distinguish between file data
and file system data/structures because you will be dealing with just
the blocks/chunks of data for block devices.

the functions readpage/writepage deals with the file data only not
with the file-system data/structures. Here I am considering by saying
other data you mean file-system data/structures

I think it doesn't matter that writepage or writepages are called
because both almost do the same thing and the writepages version deals
with more data and in your case the data may be big enough to handle
by the writepages.

I think you can first get some detailed understanding of VFS layer and
then you can easily understand the code of the file-system like EXT2 !
