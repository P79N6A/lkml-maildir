First are you passing anything on the boot prompt to the framebuffer
device? Next it looks like you selected 'Advanced low level driver
options' and somehow turned off support for 8 bit width fonts. Can you
post your .config. This fiel should be in /usr/src/linux. It's whats
generated after you run make [x,menu]config.

No. AGP is a extension of PCI. Its backwards compatiable.
