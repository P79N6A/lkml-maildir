Subject: [PATCH 2.6.15-rc6] block: Make CDROMEJECT more robust
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The eject command was failing for a large group of users for removable
devices. The "eject -r" command, which uses the CDROMEJECT ioctl would not
work, however "eject -s", which uses SG_IO did work, but required root access.
Since SG_IO was using the same mechanism as CDROMEJECT, there should be no
difference. The main reason for getting the CDROMEJECT ioctl working was
because it didn't need root privileges like the SG_IO commands did.
One bug was noticed, and that is CDROMEJECT was setting the blk request to a
WRITE operation, when in fact it wasn't. The block layer did not like getting
WRITE requests when data_len==0 and data==NULL.
The other issue was that "eject -s" was sending two extra commands that
seemed to work for just about any removable device. CDROMEJECT works as
such:
START_STOP : 0x02
While "eject -s" sent(via SG_IO):
ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL
START_STOP : 0x01
START_STOP : 0x02
This patch fixes the WRITE vs READ issue, and also sends the extra two
commands. Anyone with an iPod connected via USB (not sure about firewire)
should be able to reproduce this issue, and verify the patch.
