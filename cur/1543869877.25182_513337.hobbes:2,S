But I see __call_usermodehelper being called from the context of
khelper_wq which is a singlethreaded workqueue.
I thought we were not planning to freeze singlethreaded workqueue's for
hotplug, since we are not kthread_stopping them anywhere.
So this kthread_stop waiting for parent(khelper_wq) which is blocked on
wait_for_complete(child->vfork_done) shouldn't occur. No?
Thanks and Regards
