Excuse me, if I jump in with almost zero linux-kernel-knowledge,
and take my words as a third-party comment.
May be, I've not seen enough in 35 years of system programming
(including designing and writing journal-systems my own),
but I've never seen a journal beeing part of the data-space to be
journalled. It is simply an ugly thing in the file space. It either belongs
into /proc/fs/ext3 (or the like) or is not to be shown at all. Except
there was a valid neccessity to have it in the normal file space.
Greetings
Michael
