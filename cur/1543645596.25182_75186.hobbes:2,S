2.5.39 IDE is nowhere near as stable as 2.4.20-pre8:
- I have several boxes with decent PCI chipsets (BX, HX) but old disks.
  With 2.5.39, they tend to spew a couple of ..._intr errors on boot.
  (Sorry, can't be more specific right now. I won't be near those
  boxes until Saturday.)
- Same ..._intr errors on my 486 with a qd6580 VLB controller.
  It also has, in post-2.5.36 kernels, an instant-reboot problem which
  occurs whenever I pass the ide0=qd65xx kernel option required to
  activate its chipset support. (I _believe_ this is because the code
  does something, like a kmalloc, which is illegal at the early
  point IDE's __setup runs.) With 2.5.3x kernels, this box also sees
  a steady stream of spurious interrupts while doing a kernel recompile,
  something it doesn't see in older kernels.
- My Intel AL440LX box (440LX chipset, 20G Quantum Fireball) worked
  brilliantly up to 2.5.36, but hangs *hard* with 2.5.39 as soon
  as I tar zxf the kernel source tarball.
  (May or may not be IDE. I'll try a minimal 2.5.39 tonight.)
All of these work perfectly with 2.4.20-pre8, indeed all previous 2.4
standard kernels, 2.2 + Andre's ide-patch, and with the exception of
the ..._intr errors, 2.5.36.
OTOH, I have three boxes which do appear to work fine with 2.5.39.
