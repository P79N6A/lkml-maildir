I don't think I have a Super-I/O chip in this laptop, and no PNP
either (not for parport at least.) Most probably it has a totally
legacy parallel port.

Sure, the parport stuff is such a mess (showing its age I guess) that
we can't hope to fix everything at once, and your patch is definitely a
move in the right direction.

(/me looks at his brand new HP LaserJet P2015n network printer.)
Parallel-port printers are soooo 20th century! ;)
Seriously, no, the only parallel port devices I have are hardware
monitoring evaluation boards. I can't test much advanced parport
functionalities with these, I fear.

Patch written, I'll post it on the i2c list in a moment.

I fear I don't have the spare cycles to fulfill the "ideally" part.
Here is the naive patch I have come up with. It does the job, even
though it is not clean by any means. But as you said, it's certainly not
worse than the current state, so I hope we can still apply it.
* * * * *
Give legacy parallel ports a platform device in the device tree.
This is a quick and dirty implementation, it doesn't actually convert
the legacy parport code to the device driver model, but at least
parallel port device drivers will have a device to work with.

Phil Blundell and Tim Waugh did not reply to me last time I sent a
parport cleanup patch to them. I suspect they are indeed no longer
maintaining parport in practice.
