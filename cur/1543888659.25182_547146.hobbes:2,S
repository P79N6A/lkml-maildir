Subject: [PATCH] pci_find_slot: Mark deprecated
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/21/231

We've now fixed up most users of pci_find_slot, and the remainder are
either hard and need someone with the hardware and info to work on it, or
patches exist but are not yet merged.
Time therefore for some gentle encouragement
