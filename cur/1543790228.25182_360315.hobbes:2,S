Subject: [PATCH 06/11] uml: remove bogus WARN_ON, triggerable harmlessly on a page fault race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
The below warning was added in place of pte_mkyoung(); if (is_write)
pte_mkdirty();
In fact, if the PTE is not marked young/dirty, our dirty/accessed bit emulation
would cause the TLB permission not to be changed, and so we'd loop, and given we
don't support preemption yet, we'd busy-hang here.
However, I've seen this warning trigger without crashes during a loop of
concurrent kernel builds, at random times (i.e. like a race condition), and I
realized that two concurrent faults on the same page, one on read and one on
write, can trigger it. The read fault gets serviced and the PTE gets marked
writable but clean (it's possible on a shared-writable mapping), while the
generic code sees the PTE was already installed and returns without action. In
this case, we'll see another fault and service it normally.
