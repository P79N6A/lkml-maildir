Because it is not easy. NTFS has very sophisticated structure, not documented 
anywhere but already reverse engineered and partially documented at 
linux-ntfs project page (
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/
).
As I said this is not easy task and as such it is time consuming. All 
linux-ntfs developers are volunteers and not paid for this work. It means 
that all code is written in the free time. Much time was also spent on 
helping users (this will change now, see the manifest on the project page).
To summarize, the write support will appear sooner or later, if you volunteer 
to help, you are very welcome.
I'm ccing ntfs-dev list which is a better place to discuss such topics.
take care,
pkot
