How can an author form the opinion that another work is derivative, when
it hasn't even necessarily been written yet?
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is no statement of the author's beliefs.  It's an
algorithm of restriction, and it affects original, non-derivative works.

That's not what I said.  From the start, I've made clear that I'm
talking of original, non-derivative works.  You said that mere linking
makes that non-derivative work derivative:

This is wrong for the reasons I stated.
