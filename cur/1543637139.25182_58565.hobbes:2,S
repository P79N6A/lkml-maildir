Why not try both? I do currently use three .configs:
- everything modular
- everything but no module support at all
- everything and no module support at all but without hotplug support
For 2.5 I use similar .configs but without all the things that don't
compile for a longer time.
Trying to compile kernels with these three .configs helps to avoid that my
fast 500 MHz K6-2 is nearly always idle.  ;-)
