Perhaps adding an explicit 
    void *malloc(size_t size)
    {
	void *result = mmap((void *) 0, size + sizeof(size_t), PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
		MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, 0, 0);
	if (result == MAP_FAILED)
	    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	* (size_t *) result = size;
	return(result + sizeof(size_t));
    }
would ensure libc isn't trying to do something sneaky,
