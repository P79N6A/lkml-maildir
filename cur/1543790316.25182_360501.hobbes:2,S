It *did* what was expected -- walked back up to the mountpoint and called
statfs there. And it cannot be fixed (without loss of functionality) unless
you somehow tell it where the boundary of the subfilesystem lies.

Sure it does. I don't expect many people to use that manually though.

While most others simply don't care -- if it fails, it fails. Looking up the
free space beforehand is only a heurisitics anyway, as the free space can
change between the stat and the copy anyway.

No, it does not. But it does mean that some applications that should know
about them won't know and will give even more confusing results.
