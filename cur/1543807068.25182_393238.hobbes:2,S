The plural of anecdote is not data.  Nobody except Pavel and you ever
wrote code to work in the userland part of your suspend.  But the aim
is to have GUI-type code written by other people running between the
snapshotting and the system shutdown, right?  Code that is pretty much
by definition just plain untrustable in the first place.
The interactions with a frozen, direct-rendering X are going to be
quite amusing too.  You'll have to be very careful to switch VTs to a
suspend-aware framebuffer before snapshotting.  That could help
reducing your video-card related problems though.

You can s/mounted// on that.  It's pretty much impossible to unmount
filesystems on a running system, it's always kept busy by something.
Especially system filesystems.

Mandatory initrd?  How nice...

That's exactly what I'm terribly afraid of.  You have no way to
enforce them, so they won't be respected.  And filesystems will die
randomly and unpredictably.

You can always limit the damage by syncing the disks before
snapshotting.  This way you'll only lose the running processes if you
don't actually resume.  While having the in-memory cache of the state
of the filesystem being different of the real on-disk state eats
filesystems for breakfast.  The output of fsck is not pretty.
