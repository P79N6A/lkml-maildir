Right, it would be good to know for sure what's going on.
In my test script it was just a simple access to /dev/console, so it
might just be that modprobe wants to log something on Debian. At least
that would match the behavior I've seen here.
And we really rely on these tools to be able to print debug messages
sometimes to find other bugs (at least at the time it's theoretically
possible to log). And I don't see how modprobe could find out, that it
is not allowed to access /dev/console.
As an ideal solution, I would like to have /dev/console working before
_any_ userspace is called, and it would put all the stuff that is
written to it the kernel "dmesg buffer" as long as the console isn't
working, just to be able to see what's going on, if needed. As the
second choice, it would return -ENODEV. The current looping is
definitely not what we want. :)

Sure, we might need to change that, if it is a problem. It was mainly
to find out what was going on, because people thought that some serial
driver is involved in the loop, which I didn't believe.
To be safer, maybe we just want to move the cdev_add(),
register_chrdev_region() call, which should prevent the "userspace
driver search".
