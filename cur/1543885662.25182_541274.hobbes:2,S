Sometimes I wonder at prio_array. It has 140 entries(from 0 to 139),
and the meaning of each entry is as follows, I think.
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| index     | usage                                         |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 0 - 98    | RT processes are here. They are in the entry  |
|           | whose index is 99 - sched_priority.           |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 99        | No one use it? CMIIW.                         |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
| 100 - 139 | Ordinally processes are here. They are in the |
|           | entry whose index is (nice+120) +/- 5         |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+
What's the purpose of the prio_array[99]? Once I exlore source tree
briefly and can't found any kernel thread which uses this entry.
Does anybody know?
