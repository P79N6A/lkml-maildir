If your CPU context corrupt message is appearing with a machine check
exception report, then you processor took an internal fault reporting trap.
So it's not a happy piece of silicon I suspect - be it overclocked,
overheated or even faulty.
The machine check numbers it prints can be looked up in the processor
manuals to decode the type of fault.
