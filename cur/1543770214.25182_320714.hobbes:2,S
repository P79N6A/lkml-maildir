Hello,
dmesg tells:
---snip---
Kernel command line: root=/dev/sda2 
---snip---
io scheduler noop registered
io scheduler anticipatory registered
io scheduler deadline registered
io scheduler cfq registered
---snip---
ok - there are 4 types of io schedulers - but - how can one see/query, which i/o scheduler is the currently "active" one?
It seems that SuSE Kernel shows this via
if (!printed) {
                printed = 1;
                printk("Using %s io scheduler\n", chosen_elevator->elevator_name);
        }
in drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c
I can supply a patch if you like.
regards
roland
