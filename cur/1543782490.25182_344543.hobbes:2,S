How does that make what I wrote above wrong?  We do have two versions, all
right.  Called from one place.  Each is a one-liner in my variant, more than
that in your.

... and that does not fit "more things to do in setup_thread_info()" in
which way?

... no comments, except that 28K (ti6_1) + 24K (ti6_2) + 22K (ti6_3) +
12K (ti6_4) already appears to be more than 50K...
In any case, that's hardly the point - s/200/150/ if you wish and that
does not make the problem much better.

I seem to remember some very public conversations with you on that topic,
but again, this is not the point - the real issue is with merge strategy
you proposed.  And no, I do not believe that doing that merge + great
renaming in a single burst is feasible.  Reorder that and yes, all parts
make sense and are doable.  With essentially the same final tree.
Hell, I can even offer to do and feed the per-arch cleanups of that, getting
the final chunk down to tolerable size.  After and separate from getting m68k
to work in mainline.
To clarify the situation: this is _NOT_ an attempt to prevent ->thread_info
cleanups from getting into the tree.  I actually think that they do make
sense; moreover, they do make sense on their own and mixing them with m68k
merge only causes extra problems for both.
