That's a hard question.
Yes, it's worth throwing away the reservation and adopting a new one if
doing that is cheap.

Via various heuristics.  i_next_alloc_goal is "the physical block where I
want to allocate, as long as that allocation corresponds to the logical
block in i_next_alloc_block".  These are reasonably documented at their
definition site.

Sure.  The reservations should be per-fd, not per-inode.  We've always had
that problem.
Making them per-fd is a little tricky, because there might not be any fd's
associated with the inode - this is the
"writepage-over-a-hole-after-the-file-was-closed" problem.

Right.  That's a problem, because obtaining the new window is now
computationally expensive, and the situation which you describe will
certainly occur.
We need to solve this.
I suggest you move all the reservation info into file->private_data and
swap that into the inode in ext3_prepare_write().  We'd have to do
something along those lines because get_block() isn't passed the file*. 
i_sem is held, so there's no competition for the inode.  Make sure that
inode->reservation_info is set to NULL again before returning from
ext3_prepare_write().
This would require that all allocation-related fields be moved from the
inode into struct reserve_window, as we earlier discussed.
I think this is worth doing.  Free the struct reserve_window at
file->private_data in ext3_release_file().  Allocate and initialise it
lazily, in ext3_prepare_write().
We'll need to be able to cope with a NULL inode->reservation_info in
writepage and get_block() for the pageout-over-a-hole problem, but if the
allocation patterns are crappy there it really doesn't matter.  Your choice
here is to either allocate a new reserve_window, hosted at
inode->fallback_reservation_info just for this case, or to simply handle
the NULL inode->reservation_info in get_block() and try to do something
reasonable.
But even doing that doesn't solve the problem where we have just a single
file* writing to the file, and the application is seeking all over the
place, and there are a lot of other open files against the fs.  In that
case we will also experience potentially very serious CPU consumption
problems.
Two ways of solving this:
a) Convert that linear search into an O(log(n)) one.
b) discard the current reservation window if the application seeked away and
c) only adopt a new reservation window if
   i) the file has just been opened or
   ii) we have seen "several" logically contiguous allocation attempts.
Alternatively, if the application did an lseek, we simply retain the
file*'s current reservation window and start using it for allcations at the
new logical offset.  I think that's OK - it's no worse than what we have at
present.
