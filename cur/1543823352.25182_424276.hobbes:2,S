Linus, Andrew,
please revert 1ad3dcc0.  That was a patch to the binfmt_flat loader, 
which was motivated by an LTP testcase which checks that execve returns 
EMFILE when the file descriptor table is full.
The patch is buggy: the code now keeps file descriptors open for the 
executable and its libraries, which has confused at least one 
application.  It's also unnecessary, since there is no code that uses 
the file descriptor, so the new EMFILE error return is totally artificial.
The reversion is

and I think Luke had no objections either.
