apm --standby works fine now:
	send_event: event 9
	apic_pm_callback: rqst 0 data 3
	nmi_pm_callback: rqst 0 data 3
and on resume:
	send_event: event 11
	apic_pm_callback: rqst 1 data 0
	nmi_pm_callback: rqst 1 data 0
apm --suspend also does what it should (and already did):
	send_event: event 10
	apic_pm_callback: rqst 0 data 3
	nmi_pm_callback: rqst 0 data 3
and on resume:
	send_event: event 3
	apic_pm_callback: rqst 1 data 0
	nmi_pm_callback: rqst 1 data 0
My "standbybutton" still hardlocks however.
Should I dig up some more info about my mainboard/BIOS?

Try "sleep 2; apm --standby" or paste the newline with your mouse.
It works for me - my keyboard probably still sends data when my
system is already going into standby.

It slows down booting a few seconds, and besides, I usually
know it when I add hardware, so kudzu is one of the first
packages I remove when installing.

It locked when suspending so I don't expect the added
"case APM_STANDBY_RESUME" to make any difference.
printk() doesn't seem to be logical too, and I tried the
"case APM_SYS_STANDBY" and "case APM_SYS_SUSPEND" yesterday
(didn't make a difference) so it looks like the mdelay()
does it.
