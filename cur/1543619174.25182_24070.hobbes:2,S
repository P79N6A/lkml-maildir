With fork/exec, for each page table there are two cases:
  - The parent instantiated the page table.  In this case the extra work to
    set the ptes RO (only for CoW pages) is insignificant.
  - The parent is still sharing the page table with its parent and so the
    ptes are still set RO.
I don't see how there is a whole lot of fat to cut here.
