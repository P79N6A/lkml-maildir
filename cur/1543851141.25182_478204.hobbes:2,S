I don't think either works very well, really.  How frequently do we
rate-limit it?  If it's faster than once-per-hour then we'll irritate
people.
Maybe that's the answer.  Once-per-hour.
umm, I think we'd need something like this:
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
printk_ratelimit() has global state which makes it not useful for callers
which wish to perform ratelimiting at a particular frequency.
Add a printk_timed_ratelimit() which utilises caller-provided state storage to
permit more flexibility.
This function can in fact be used for things other than printk ratelimiting
and is perhaps poorly named.
