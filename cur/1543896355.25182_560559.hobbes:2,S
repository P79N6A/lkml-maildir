According to the documents I found about SELinux, you can also
 - create a this-app-needs-selfmodification type
 - allow users to change the context type of their files to this type
 - configure a domain to allow self-modification
 - configure the domain transition
Brave words from someone who did not yet successfully find the magic in
order to install the refpolicy on debilian (after finding their refpolicy-foo
to be incomplete and their refpolicy-src to not compile).
