That was indeed the reason, at least in my case.  The newly-rebooted
kernel doesn't work too well when there are active devices, with no driver
loaded, doing DMA and issuing IRQs because they were never shut down.

Do I understand your argument correctly?  You seem to be saying that 
because this new facility sometimes won't work (the kexec-on-panic case) 
it shouldn't be added at all.  What about all the other times when it will 
work?
