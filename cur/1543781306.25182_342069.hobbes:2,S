Sorry for not being clear.  When 8250_pci.c invokes the function
serial8250_register_port(&serial_port) at line 1736 (linux-2.6.12.4), I
am seeing the following values: number of ports in the pci device is 1,
and the port structure has io_type:2, iobase:0, membase:80005000 and
mapbase:d6000000. In turn, The serial8250_register_port procedure in
8250.c calls the serial8250_find_match_or_unused(port) routine (line
2439 in 8250.c of linux-2.6.12.4) which returns 0. Hence the
uart_add_one_port(&serial8250_reg, &uart->port) (line 2455 in 8250.c of
linux-2.6.12.4) codes are not touched and serial8250_register_port
returns -28 (-ENOSPC) to the register_port caller.
Please let me know, if this is data is not clear and thanks for your
immediate attention.
