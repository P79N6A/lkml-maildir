Unfortunately, the problem isn't solved, merely worked around.  We
need to figure out why this is happening in the first place.
To recap, the system hangs completely when you load the ppa module.
Are you using any special parport/ppa parameters?  Is this an SMP or a
uniprocessor machine?  Come to that, which architecture is it?
Are there any messages displayed to the console when the hang happens?
If you could scatter some printks around (KERN_CRIT so they show up on
the console) to figure out the example point at which it's hanging,
that would be great.
Thanks,
Tim.
