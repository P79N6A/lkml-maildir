I don't think a upgrade only will solve this -- I have the same problem,
did the same thing he did w/ slack, but i'm running glibc-2.1.2 and
tried w/ glibc-2.1 and this error (?) insists on it. I think that maybe
is some strange thing in slack's profile, 'cause in RH6 this don't
happen. Maybe a wrong file mode?
