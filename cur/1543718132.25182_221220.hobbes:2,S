Oh, then there is no comparison.  I had not seen any in the marketplace in
recent years and just assumed they were no longer being made.

OK, but I'll bet the preinstalled Unix isn't Linux.  You don't say how many
owners switched to Linux, so as a WAG let's say 10%.  Let's also WAG that
10% of PC9800 owners switched from preinstalled Monopoly Windows to X11
Windows plus Linux.  I'll bet that the number of PC9800 machines still in
existence is an order of magnitude larger than the number of PowerPC
machines still in existence (including current ones).
This still doesn't mean that I like the PC9800 by the way.  For comparison,
Monopolysoft taught me to hate Monopolysoft, but for some reason I think it
would not be wise to delete FAT and NTFS filesystem handlers from Linux.
