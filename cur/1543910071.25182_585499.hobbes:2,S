Try a testcase (experimentally verify).

True, "implementation-defined" as per the C standard _is_ supposed to mean
"unspecified behaviour where each implementation documents how the choice
is made". So ok, probably GCC isn't "documenting" this
implementation-defined behaviour which it is supposed to, but can't really
fault them much for this, probably.
