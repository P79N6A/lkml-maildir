Hi Andrew,
its time again for an s390 update. One bigger patch, splitted in
two parts so that they make it over lkml. The purpose of the big
one is to speed up system calls on s390. I managed to squeeze
about 65 cycles from each system call. This improved e.g. getpid()
from 232 to 157 cycles. As a nice side-effect it simplified the
uaccess functions considerably.
Short descriptions:
1) s390 core fixes.
2) Dasd driver fixes.
3) z/VM monitor stream module fixes.
4) Network driver fixes.
5) Tape driver fixes.
6) System call speedup part 1.
7) System call speedup part 2.
The patches applied without rejects on todays bitkeeper and
2.6.5-rc2-mm3.
blue skies,
  Martin.
