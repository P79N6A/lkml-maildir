Perhaps more important to my mind is what lead the developers of
this code to go to such significant lengths to provide this access
check in the first place. Why was it considered sufficiently important?
I concur that it's an ugly bit of hackery, but someone must have felt
it was necessary or they wouldn't have done it.
