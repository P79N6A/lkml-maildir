Well, I'm not exactly sure what we can do when people report conflicts,
except telling them "don't do that". I guess each case will be
different. We will have to ask reporters for their DSDT table, look at
it and... do something. I'll need (much) help from the ACPI developers.
At this point we are mainly trying to gather enough data to fully
understand how big the problem is. Solutions will come later.

User will simply miss their SMBus controller or their hardware
monitoring device, it wont prevent them from using their systems, but
that should be enough to get them to report (I hope).
