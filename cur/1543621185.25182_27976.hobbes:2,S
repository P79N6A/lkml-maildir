Please see
  
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/patches/linux-devel/2.5.4-pre5/
for current nfsd patches.
  patch-E-NfsdSyscallCleanup  
might be of particular interest.
When I have finished testing these (sometime next week I hope) I will
be submitting them to Linux for 2.5, and then backporting them to 2.4,
and hopefully submitting the least intrusive ones to Marcello shortly
after 2.4.18 comes out.
These patches:
  remove most of the BKL
  enable TCP support
  plus assorted other things.
Comments, and testing, most welcome.
