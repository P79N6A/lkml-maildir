No, it does not.  If the signal mask is recomputed by the program for 
each new wait call then you have a lot more work to do when the signal 
mask is implicitly specified.

Not good enough?  It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  What can 
there be "not good enough"?

I know very well what a timeout is.  But the way the timeout can be 
specified can vary.  It is often useful (as for select, poll) to specify 
relative timeouts.
But there are equally useful uses where the timeout is needed at a 
specific point in time.  Without a syscall interface which can have a 
absolute timeout parameter we'd have to write as a poor approximation at 
userlever
     clock_gettime (CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts);
     struct timespec rel;
     rel.tv_sec = abstmo.tv_sec - ts.tv_sec;
     rel.tv_nsec = abstmo.tv_sec - ts.tv_nsec;
     if (rel.tv_nsec < 0) {
       rel.tv_nsec += 1000000000;
       --rel.tv_sec;
     }
     if (rel.tv_sec < 0)
       inttmo = -1;  // or whatever is used for return immediately
     else
       inttmo = rel.tv_sec * UINT64_C(1000000000) + rel.tv_nsec;
      wait(..., inttmo, ...)
Not only is this much more expensive to do at userlevel, it is also 
inadequate because calls to settimeofday() do  not cause a recomputation 
of the timeout.
See Ingo's RT futex stuff as an example for a kernel interface which 
does it right.
