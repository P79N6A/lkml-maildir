Hmm.  I just noticed that your problem was with 
suspend, not standby.  The same scenario could occur
with suspend, of course.  However, the scenario does
not match the problem you describe.  I don't see how
a change to the apm driver could cause a suspend to
turn into something that looks like a standby-plus-crash.
Are you sure that the machine is hanged: SysRq-s,
SysRq-u, SysRq-b doesn't work?
