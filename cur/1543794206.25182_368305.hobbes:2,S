I agree. But I am not interested in adding whole lot of complexity in
the kernel, just because some "potential" use for this. I want to know,
if people/products which really really need this feature and their 
requirements, before I go down that path.
For that matter, HSM folks really care about DMAPI. But I never got
them to explicitly tell me, what is the most minimum subset interfaces
they *absolutely* need (and why) in the whole DMAPI specs :( I always
hear complaints about not having DMAPI.
Thanks,
Badari
