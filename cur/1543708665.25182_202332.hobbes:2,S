Keep in mind the context is Linux running on non-sane hardware, sloooow CPUs, 
latency sensitive small io buffers etc. Losing system wide throughput to have 
the hardware codec not be starved is a happy trade off to make.
So far all the comments are very PC centric. I suspect the history of the no 
interrupt priorities goes back a lot of years.  Perhaps the answer is that it 
never seemed to help having priorities much on PC hardware so lets not deal 
with the complexity in the software.
Any more historical insights?
I wonder how hard it would be add for embedded types of 
applications/architectures?
