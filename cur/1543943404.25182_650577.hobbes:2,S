I'm not sure if this is right compared to my original patch. Does it
ever make sense to ask "is this pte a swap entry?" on a machine with no
MMU? Presumably this also means it has no ptes too, right? In which
case, it's better to comment the whole function out. Then when someone
tries to ask the above meaningless question, they get a compile error
rather than a meaningless answer.
