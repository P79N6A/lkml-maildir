  No. At least, I have no idea. :-(

OK. I will write a patch of function to set it for some arch/platform.

Yes. In my current patch of memory hotplug, Removable is like Highmem.
 ( <

     It is group B of "Hot Add patches for NUMA" )
I tried to make new removable zone which could be with normal and dma
before it. But, it needs too much work as you said. So, I gave up it.
I heard Matt-san has some ideas for it. So, I'm looking forward to 
see it.

I suppose if this patch have worked for one year,
unlucky case might occur. Probably, enterprise system will not
allow it. So, I will try disabling fallback for KernNoRclm.
Thanks.
