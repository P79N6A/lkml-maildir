and lo, v0004 was born:
- use (3 KHz timebase / 2) for driving profiler
- fix startup collision between decrementer and perfmon
- dynamically enable/disable power management on start/stop
- use PVR to make sure we're on a supported CPU
- actually start/stop inside pm_start_cpu/pm_stop_cpu
- begin to implement syscall interception
- build system-related cleanups
- further comments
- style cleanups
