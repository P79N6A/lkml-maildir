It is not an interface is "default". It is default set of parameters.
When new interface appears, it inherits parameters from this set.
That's all.

The doc is not quite right. "all" do apply to all the interfaces.
But only "forwarding" variable is changed automatically on all
the devices, when "all" is changed.
All the others combine with device specific setting either
with "and" or with "or". For me rule is simple: good options are ored,
dangerous ones are anded 8). For exact rules see include/linux/inetdevice.h
The exception is "accept_redirects": it is anded for router (dangerous)
and ored for host (safe one).

These options never even intersect with any firewall rules.
If conf/* options order to block, it will block.

It is absolutely impossible. What did you drink? 8)8)8)
It is joke. I think you saw them in input chain, because
it is tested before packet enters IP stack. IP stack do not
eat such a crap yet 8).

They are one thing really. Just two names for one variable.
