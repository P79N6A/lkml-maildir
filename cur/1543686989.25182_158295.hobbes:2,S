In other words: it is more tolerant against broken setups.

For sure.

Ah yes. Maybe we are getting to the real point of the discussion. If I remember
that right kernels 2.0 and 2.2 behave differently, so you are talking about
setups for 2.4 kernels. I am very interested to hear what a valid setup looks
like that is broken by the default behaviour of _other_ RFC-conformant
implementations. That is exactly what you are telling us here.
If you cannot describe such a setup, then you basically say you don't want to
follow the mainstream because you want to keep broken setups going.
I have heard things like that before from some well-known big company...
Can't you simply state the true reason why you are playing shepherd for a dead
cow?

Stephan
