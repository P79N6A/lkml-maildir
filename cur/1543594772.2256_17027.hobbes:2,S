When was the last time you did the same thing?  Nobody gets client side
Java to work properly across all the platforms without a lot of tweaking.
And the last time we did it was recently, the entire BK GUI is in tcl/tk,
almost 20,000 lines of code (that would be 80,000 for you Java fans),
and the GUI has revision history browsers, changeset browsers, source
browsers, check in tools, diff tools, rename tools, file mergers, etc.
It's pretty complete and it typically comes very close to just working
across all platforms.  The sort of differences we deal with are little
things like the font names not being the same on Unix/NT.  Java would
*love* to be that good, it's nowhere near.
Here's some more stats.  We fired up a Java based file merge tool on a
file and then did the same thing with our tk based one.  The Java tool
took 38MB to do the same merge as the tk one; the tk one took 4MB.  And
before you start saying "well, the tk one must be simplistic", we hand
the Guiffy guy our test cases all the time and it fails them.  So it's
a pretty reasonable apples to apples, in fact, it's slanted in favor of
the Java tool.
We couldn't believe that Java was really that bad so our GUI guy, Aaron
Kushner, sat down and rewrote the revision history browser in Java.
On a 500 node graph, the Java tool was up to 85MB.  The tk tool doing
the same thing was 5MB.  Note that we routinely run the tool on files 
with 4000 nodes, we can't even run the Java tool on files that big,
it crashes.
You could argue that we need custom widgets to do what we are doing,
but that's lame.  We don't need any custom widgets for tk, in fact, 
we are using straight tk, no extensions.
So, yeah, we have done what you think we haven't done, and we've tried
the Java way, we aren't making this stuff up.  We run into Java fanatics
all the time and when we start asking "so what toolkits do you use" we
get back "well, actually, err, umm, none of them are any good so we write
our own".  That's pathetic.
