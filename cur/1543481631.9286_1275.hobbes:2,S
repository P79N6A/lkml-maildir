Just got this oops while working with a VFAT filesystem under 2.2.0pre8.
I made my Netscape mail folder (~/nsmail) a symbolic link to where I have
Netscape store my mail under Windows so I can share my mail folders
between Linux and Win95.  I got the oops while in X11 using Netscape to
access my email, so there wasn't anything on any consoles - this was all
that was in my logs.  I can provide more information if need be.
Oh, yes - I have following VFAT-related modules loaded:
nls_iso8859-1
nls_cp437
vfat
fat
All my other modules are for SCSI, ethernet, serial (for my modem) and PPP
(so I can send this mail).
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000024
current->tss.cr3 = 02d58000, %cr3 = 02d58000
*pde = 00000000
