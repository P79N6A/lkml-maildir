Even if kexec is not brought into the picture the devices need to be quiesed on
reboot.  On x86 and probably other architectures there are 2 ways a reboot can go.
1) The firmware when it regains control toggles the motherboard reset
   line resetting all of the devices, so nothing we do really makes a difference.
2) The firmware when it regains control tweaks a few things and
   pretends it was never out of control, and restarts the boot
   process.
When the firmware does not toggle the motherboard reset line during a
reboot the firmware case is exactly equivalent to the kexec one.
So shutdown needs to quiese things.
