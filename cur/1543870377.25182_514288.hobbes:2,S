OK... I found it.
I had to loop on accept() :
        for (i=0; i<num; ++i) {
                if (event[i].data.fd == main_server_s) {
                        do {
                                err = evtest_callback_main(event[i].data.fd);
                                } while (err != -1);
                        }
                else
                        err = evtest_callback_client(event[i].data.fd);
        }
Or else we can miss an event forever...
