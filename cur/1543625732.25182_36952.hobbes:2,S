Early 2.4 required it due to a flawed design decision in the VM, that is 
fixed in the rmap VM at least and I think in the base VM by 2.4.18

Not quite   remember its  (ram - whatever the kernel needs). Its quite
feasible to run with no swap. With current -ac trees (latest 19pre3-ac
series) you can check /proc/meminfo and Committed_AS is your worst case
swap usage assuming the kernel ate all of RAM.
