[PATCH] USB: fix remove device after set_configuration
If a device can't be configured, the current test9 code forgets
to clean it out of sysfs.  This resolves that issue, so the retry
in usb_new_device() stands a chance of working.
The enumeration code still doesn't handle such errors well, but
at least this way that hub port can be used for another device.
