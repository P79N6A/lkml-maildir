This sounds like a very good idea, yes.
Or, maybe even make it such that initramfs acts like a file system,
that will just de-cpio the content of a block device to a ramfs.
Pro:
 - requires less or no changes to existing initrd
 - one can experiment with initramfs loaded from other sources than
   an initrd
Contra: 
 - needs more infrastructure than plain initramfs
