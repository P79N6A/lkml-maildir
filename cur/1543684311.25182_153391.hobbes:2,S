I think it got posted after test2 finalized; and the patches I
saw were line-wrapped so I couldn't even read them.

That's the symptom I saw when I tried ACPI + NForce2 (by accident)
a while back ... except that in your case it happens for IRQs
below 16 (which might be just an accident).  "pci=noacpi" was a
workaround.
If this appears with that patch of mine applied, then I'd certainly
agree with you that this is something other than a USB problem.
