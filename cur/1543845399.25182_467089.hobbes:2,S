Right. Any copyright license will basically say
	"You can distribute this assuming you do so-and-so"
and a contract can actually extend on that and also limit you in other 
ways than just distribution, ie you can sat
	"You can buy this, but you cannot legally benchmark it"
However, none of that actually extends your "derived work" in any way.
