sdparm is a command line utility designed to get and set
SCSI device parameters (cf hdparm for ATA disks). Apart
from SCSI devices (e.g. disks, tapes and enclosures) sdparm
can be used on any device that uses a SCSI command set
(e.g. CD/DVD drives). sdparm also can list VPD pages including
the device identification page.
The major addition in version 0.93 is transport protocol
specific modes pages for FCP, SPI and SAS.
