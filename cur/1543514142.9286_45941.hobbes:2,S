	Yes, memory accounting is per process.  We don't have
	(nor BSD has) a per *user* memory limit, although such
	might be of what people like you would love to see.

	With 2.2 kernels (and fresh utilities) you can create 2 GB swap
	partitions, and (if I read mm/swapfile.c  correctly), there is
	no upper hard limit on number of swap files/partitions allowed
	in the system.  ( That is, after some fast swap, do throw in a
	20 GB IDE disk sliced to 10 partitions, 2GB each.. I have heard
	that such monsters are around USD 400 apiece.. )

	No.  (Aside of not mentioning what kernel you are now running.)
