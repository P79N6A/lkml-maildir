As Junio suggested, you can have a look at StGIT
(
http://www.procode.org/stgit/
) for a different workflow. There is a
tutorial both on the web and in the doc/ directory but, anyway, it is
pretty similar to Quilt only that the patches are GIT commits.
In principle, you keep all the patches in a stack whose base is the
HEAD of Linus' kernel. You can indefinitely modify/push/pop the
patches and, once you are happy with the state of the stack, ask Linus
to pull using standard GIT commands (or mail them with 'stg
mail'). You can afterwards pull the latest changes from Linus using
'stg pull'. This operation pops the patches you have, advances the
base of the stack (so no "merge" message) and pushes your patches
back. Since pushing is done with a three-way merge, it detects whether
there are any upstream modifications to your patches (if not, all the
patches should become empty and safely removed from the stack).
You can also have a branch for upstream merges only and you can easily
cherry-pick patches or commits from other branches. This is quite
useful if you want to continue the work on your development branch
until Linus merges your patches.
