I suggested this to Andrew.  His reply was as follows:

I admit that the whole things is fragile.  IMO the safest approach would
be for __down_read and __down_write not to assume that interrupts are
currently enabled.  But that would introduce more overhead as well; at
least this way the overhead is confined to the notifier chain registration
routines.
