Alan,
	Here is a patch that reserves the 108 and 109 ioctl numbers for
get/set last sector. This patch has already been merged into the ia64
tree, and is currently necessary in order to support the EFI GPT
partitioning scheme on ia64. It is also in the Red Hat kernel tree. I had
assumed that somebody at Red Hat would have forwarded it to you.
	Please apply.
	If you would consider the rest of the patch that implements the
ioctls, I can send you that as well.

  If each of us have one object, and we exchange them,
     then each of us still has one object.
  If each of us have one idea,   and we exchange them,
     then each of us now has two ideas.
