	1. Regardless of whatever specification you are referring to
or Andre's "31 second rule of [Power On Self Test]", it is genuinely
useful to boot faster by overlapping some other kernel work before the
drive is.  Specifications ultimately exist only to serve this
usefulness.  When a specification impedes usefulness, sometimes it's
the right decision to violate it.  Of course, we're not talking about
your IDE code violating such a specification, but rather not relying
on this particular guarantee.
	2. Besides, if this code is supposed to be a generic IDE core,
it many need to run on platforms that do not provide that guarantee or
where the boot code is not even capable of finding where all of the
IDE controllers.
	3. In the hierarchy of upgradability, it is generally easier
to replace the kernel than the Power On Self Test, which is more often
in flash or ROM, and which may require help from an unenthusiastic
hardware vendor.  So, it is better to weight trade-offs a few notches
in favor of avoid reliance on guarantees about the Power On Self Test.
	If I understand correctly, the cost of this trade off would be
adding one or two lines that add perhaps 20 bytes and as many CPU
cycles at initiailzation (except when this change really is necessary).
