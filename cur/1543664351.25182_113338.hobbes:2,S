I found a solution at last...
C-Media proposes a Linux driver at
http://www.cmedia.com.tw/driver/Linux/Ac97/cmaudio-034.tar.gz
This driver works well with 2.4.20.
Who maintains the i810_audio / AC97-related things? I think the C-Media 
driver should be folded into the regular kernel (otherwise it won't get 
maintained).
