I have recently purchased the highpoint rocketraid 1540, which comes with a 
driver. It wount compile in 2.6.1, which is understandable. I tried the promise 
open source driver, which results in a similar error, somewhere in the irq-
system (irq.h).
Now the question is, would it be a accomplishable task for me to fix this, and 
what are the differences from the old to the new one, and what must i watch out 
for?
Anyone familiar to the changes it has been through?
Thanks, Martin.
