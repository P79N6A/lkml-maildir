It's the packet protocol family (AF_PACKET/PF_PACKET).  Check out all
the address/protocol family defintions in <socket.h>.

This is what modprobe is given by the kernel to locate the driver for
this protocol.  Add this to your /etc/conf.modules:
alias net-pf-17 af_packet
And make sure you've configured CONFIG_PACKET as a module:
