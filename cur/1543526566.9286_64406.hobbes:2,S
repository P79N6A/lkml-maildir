Consider it another measure in line with the C2 rating of Linux:
Linux is at C2 of the orange book ratings. This means that accidental
access to protected information is blocked. 
What Mike is proposing is that a root-user can type "cat
/encrypted_fs/secretfile". Under standard Linux he'd accidentally see
the file without a complaint. This is actually contrary to the C2
rating.
Whatever mike has in mind, he'll move Linux one step further towards
the B rating, as prohibiting root-access to these files is a neccesary
step for aquiring a B rating....
