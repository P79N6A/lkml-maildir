	Hmm, do you have a battery backup unit for 9550sx? I don't,
and the 3ware BIOS does not even allow me to enable write caching without it.
So I don't think the write caching on the controller side is related
to my problem.
	I have been able to improve the latency by upgrading the firmware
to the newest release (wow, they even have a firmware updating utility
for Linux!).
