Subject: function to zero out module ref count so module can be unloaded in 2.6 kernel?

In 2.4 kernel one could check MOD_IN_USE and repeatedly call
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT until the ref count drops to zero.
Is there a function in 2.6 kernel that would zero out the ref count so
that module can be unloaded ?
Need to implement ioctl for a driver to zero out the ref count.
Thanks
Vivek
