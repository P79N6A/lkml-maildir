Only some of the hdparm functionality is supported in libata, which is 
partially by design. Presently there's no way to override the DMA 
settings in libata, it starts out at the fastest supported settings and 
falls back if it gets too many errors of certain types.
You shouldn't be seeing errors like this unless you have bad IDE cables 
or are using 40-wire cables with high UDMA modes. Can you post the 
output you're seeing?
