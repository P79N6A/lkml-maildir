Assuming that kprint_block_flush() is a combination of
kprint_block_printit() and kprint_block_abort(), you
coulld make a macro wrapper for this to preclude leaks:
#define KPRINT_BLOCK(block, level, code) \
do { \
	struct kprint_block block; \
	kprint_block_init(&block, KPRINT_##level); \
	do { \
		code ; \
		kprint_block_printit(&block); \
	while (0); \
	kprint_block_abort(&block); \
} while(0)
The inner do { } while(0) region is so you can abort with "break".
(Or you can split it into KPRINT_BEGIN() and KPRINT_END() macros,
if that works out to be cleaner.)
