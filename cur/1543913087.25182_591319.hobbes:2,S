Dear All:
Was IC Plus IP1000A Linux Driver in kernel tree or not? Our customer is pushing us to put it into kernel. Is there anything that we should do?
Thanks.
Best Regards,
Jesse Huang

You can clone a standard git tree of the kernel, then fetch the 'ipg' branch at:
git://electric-eye.fr.zoreil.com/home/romieu/linux/linux-2.6-out
It should be safe up to commit f66b763f55de7fa863beb954ccef9fe3b044955d
After this commit... Well, I should really try my own dog food before advertising it :o)
