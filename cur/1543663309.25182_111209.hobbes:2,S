	You're right.  My second sentence was an oversimplification.
I should have said "software references" rather than file descriptors
to include things like "ifconfig eth0 up" creating a reference,
mounting a block device creating a refernece, etc.  (Perhaps I
should have stated only my first sentence and stopped there.)
	Anyhow, my point is that removing a piece of hardware
does not require that the corresponding module be unloaded
immediately.
