This is after ImageMagic exited?  If so, and you don't have a userland
hog sitting on that memory, I'd suggest posting /proc/meminfo and any
part of /proc/slabinfo showing large numbers of allocations.  (if you
can repeat with latest vanilla kernel that is)

I'd lean toward kernel.  If it was thrashing so hard that the box became
a doorstop for 20 minutes, seems to me that's a fine description of oom,
so somebody should have been killed.  Does SysRq-M work during the
seizure?
