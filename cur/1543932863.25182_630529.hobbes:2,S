Andrew,
I re-based the for_mm branch at:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jwessel/linux-2.6-kgdb.git;a=shortlog;h=for_mm
against the git-x86/mm branch from the x86-git tree. If there are other
patch trees I need to pull in and patch against to allow for kgdb to be
included into -mm please let me know.
I would like to submit another review request for kgdb into the mainline
as well as resolve the issues with the -mm tree + kgdb.
Thanks,
Jason.
