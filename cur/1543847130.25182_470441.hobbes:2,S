I'm still not sure why bus_attach_device() was split off from 
bus_add_device() in the first place.  Was it just so that the 
kobject_uevent() call could go in between?
Is there any reason they couldn't be recombined into a single function?

Agreed; I don't like the duplication of code.  It's wasteful and 
error-prone (somebody might change one routine and not the other).

This looks okay, but it would be better if bus_remove_device() did not
directly call bus_delete_device().  Just add an extra call inside
device_del(), so that everything remains symmetrical.
While I'm harping on style issues, you should also capitalize AttachError
so that it matches the form of the other statement labels nearby.  And in
bus_remove_device() you should put all the code inside the "if" block
instead of returning when dev->bus isn't set, just as the neighboring
subroutines do.
