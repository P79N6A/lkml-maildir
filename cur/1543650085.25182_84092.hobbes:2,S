Run `grep inode /proc/slabinfo' and `cat /proc/meminfo'.  You're
probably running into the problem wherein all of lowmem is full
of inodes which are pinned by highmem pagecache.
If so then this:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.19rc5aa1/10_inode-highmem-2
will fix it.
Please test it and send a report.  It's time to get that into
Marcelo.
