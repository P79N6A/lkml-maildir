Out of interest, do you know if the TCG has analyzed their use of SHA-1 
in light of various attacks on the algorithm over the last few years?
The IETF has published analysis and recommendations relating to the use of 
SHA-1 (and other cryptographic hashes) with IP protocols:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4894.txt
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4270.txt
It would be useful to know if similar analysis has been performed for TPM.
