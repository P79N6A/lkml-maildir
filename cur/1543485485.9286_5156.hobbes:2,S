Perhaps the BIOS has not set up the motherboard interrupt steering
for this card.  If you have a BIOS "non PnP operating system" option
in the BIOS setup, try toggling it.
Alternatively, it may be possible (anyone know?) to invoke the
BIOS "Set PCI Interrupt" function from Linux to configure it properly.
