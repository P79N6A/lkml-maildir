I don't know what caused that one.

This appears to have happened because fixed_mdio_register_device() (or
phy_device_create) didn't suitably initialise phy_device.dev.
But I don't immediately see why this doesn't affect all phy drivers. 
Presumably it's the fixed driver which is at fault.  Jeff, how is this
supposed to work?
Thanks.
