IDE hotswap has never worked (OOTB at least) in Linux, and based on my
experience it never will.  Seems the IDE folks doesn't care a bit
about it.  (No offence meant.  Just keeping it real.)
So if you really need this, here's the opportunity to make a whole lot
of people happy by implementing it yourself.  You'll probably need a
lot of time on your hands - there's a very real chance that the IDE
maintainers are too busy or whatever to answer any newbie questions
you might have about how to attack the IDE layer.

I disagree...
I've used it for TBs of data without any problems.
OTOH, with the regular ATA stuff I've experienced loads of IRQ
problems, crashes and hangups.
