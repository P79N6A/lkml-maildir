Overall, I'd have to say that this:
-		dead_swap_page =
-			(PageSwapCache(page) &&
-			 page_count(page) == (1 + !!page->buffers));
-
Is nicer as:
		int dead_swap_page = 0;
		if (PageSwapCache(page)
		    && page_count(page) == (page->buffers ? 1 : 2))
			dead_swap_page = 1;
After all, the second is what the code *means* (1 and 2 are magic
numbers).
That said, anyone who doesn't understand the former should probably
get some more C experience before commenting on others' code...
Rusty.
