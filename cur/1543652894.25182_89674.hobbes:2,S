  Can I check if skb->users is not zero, it mean function hasn't been freed? Or just forget about it?
  But what's happen if someone's ->func will return NET_RX_DROP, but not called the kfree_skb ? Is it not good to check for it?
Why should we trust for that function, may be someone forget to do it? 
PS: Sorry, if my this questions hurts anyone, but for last almost 10 years, I'm using the Linux, I like it so much, and I want improve it and make it better, as much as possible.
All the Best!
Serge.
