For rmdir it is simple: the filesystem that supports whiteouts must know how
to get rid of them again. Since it knows how the whiteouts are implemented it
can do that in an optimized fashion.
The rename story is somehow different. A union directory consists of multiple
directories on different filesystem. Since rename syscall is only working on
one filesystem the rename is crossing devices. Therefore I return -EXDEV. Not
very efficient but really simple. At least this is how my patches implement it.
