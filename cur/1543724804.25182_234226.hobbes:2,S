Well, most VM implementations use an  generative aproach, where fresh
objects are kept in a smaller hot pool and aged out (nursery), expecting
less traversal. It is not enough to keep the marks in a central location
with pointers, since you have actually follow those pointers into the object
and travers the graphs.
