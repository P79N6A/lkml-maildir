I didn't find anything in the starfire chipset's documentation about this, 
so is there a deeper reason for this ordering? As far as I know, most if 
not all x86 PCI chipsets silently map MWI to MW, so it should only matter 
for non-x86 plaforms, right?
And, in general, are there any other tricks one can do to speed up the PCI 
transactions on non-x86 platforms? I'm still getting occasional overruns 
on sparc64 (card receiving packets faster than it can push them over PCI), 
which is somewhat disturbing..
Thanks,
Ion
