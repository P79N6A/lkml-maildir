You need some kind of special tool anyway, i.e. getfattr/setfattr.  What 
tool you use isn't really important.
The fact that getfattr/setfattr can't deal with attributes that aren't 
ASCII strings seem like flaws in these tools.

Exactly, and that's a total screwup.  It makes something that would 
otherwise be possible -- for some filesystems to have an attribute (call 
it "system.dosattrib") which is used, and for others which is stored. 
The problem is that with the current design, that won't happen.
Encoding this in the namespace, therefore preventing this kind of 
compatiblity, is daft.  From the looks of it, the CIFS people were 
planning to do the "put everything in user.*" workaround for this design 
error.
