CPU activity was always going to be desired but tricky. At the moment, I
know of at least three ways people have implemented it, yours, one from
the NSLU2 people and the existing old ARM LED infrastructure.
For the old ARM approach, see arch/arm/kernel/process.c
NSLU2 patch:
http://trac.nslu2-linux.org/kernel/browser/trunk/patches/2.6.17/50-leds-arm-cpu-activity.patch
These other two patches are good in that they hook into the idle handler
and only do things at cpu idle time rather than running every 5ms.
Running every 5ms is not going to work well on my arm handheld (for
example). The existing ARM code is the simplest but doesn't give the
amount of configuration the NSLU2 people want.
I've just been asked for a trigger with the same behaviour as the old
ARM LED code to complicate matters (then we have no reason people can't
port their LED code over to the new interface). For that reason I'll be
writing a trigger to emulate the old ARM approach.

Running every 5ms like this *is* going to hit performance, particularly

At the moment you check (used_cputime > 0). If you compared that to some
small value instead of zero, you might reduce the always on threshold.
Finding that threshold might be tricky though.

Is that differentiation useful in practise? (I'll have to try it and see
I guess)
There is no right answer here. I want to test the different approaches
before any of these triggers get into mainline as we don't want a great
stack of different cpu activity triggers. Perhaps you could do the same
and see how you feel about the other approaches.
