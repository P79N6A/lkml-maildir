I've heard that SELinux has produced benchmarks such as 7% increased CPU
load.  Is this true and current?  Is it dependent on policy?  What is
the policy lookup complexity ( O(1), O(n), O(nlogn)...)?  Are there
other places where a bottleneck may exist aside from gruffing with the
policy?  Isn't the policy actually in xattrs so it's O(1)?  Where else
would an overhead that big come from aside from a lookup in a table?
....
Why is the sky blue?  Why do you have a mustach?  Why doesn't mommy have
one?  Does she shave it?
At any rate, my personal end goal is a secure high-performance operating
system, as user friendly as Ubuntu, Mandriva, or Win----.  To this end,
I'm (still; a lot of you have seen me before) evaluating the performance
hit of various user and kernel security enhancements like PaX,
ProPolice, various OpenWall/GrSecurity niceness that needs to be divided
out, and of course LSM/SELinux.  Also wondering about that PHKMalloc
thing on openbsd; is it really all that, is it junk, how's it compare to
the recent ptmalloc work, and can it run on Linux for direct benching .
. . but that's off topic.

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
    wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
    new problems waiting out there.
