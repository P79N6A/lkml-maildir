I spose it makes sense, if we'll be making scalability changes in there.

Would prefer `mm_counter_t' here.
Why not a typedef?

Why were only two counters converted?
Could I suggest that you rename all these counters, so that code which
fails to use the macros won't compile?
That renaming can be hidden in the header file: add an underscore to the
front of all the identifiers, paste that underscore back within the macros.
