Sure. Some patches are like that, but even then you can split it out so 
that one patch does _only_ that part, and is verifiable as doing only that 
part.
It's also pretty rare. We've had a few big ones like that, notably when 
moving a BKL around (moving it from the VFS layer down into each 
individual filesystem). And I can't see that really happening in a 
security-only patch.
