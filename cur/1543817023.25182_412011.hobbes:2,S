Btw, would you mind if I just re-created that as a single patch instead? 
Especially with the first commit being slightly corrupt (look at the first 
line of the commit message ;), and some of the later commits just fixing 
things up further, it would appear to be cleaner to just merge it as a 
single "initial splice support" commit..
