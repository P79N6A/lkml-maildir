Hi,
this goes out to the SusE folks in here: 
What the heck is needed to get one's hands on the contents of
kernel-source-2.6.27.7-9.1.i586.rpm
The usual tools fail.
Downloaded from 
http://ftp.uni-bayreuth.de/linux/opensuse/distribution/11.1/repo/oss/suse/i586/
And why not provide a .CAB for it? Seems to work better anyway.
