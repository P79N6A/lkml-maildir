sdparm is a command line utility designed to get and set
SCSI device parameters (cf hdparm for ATA disks). The
parameters are held in mode pages. Apart from SCSI devices
(e.g. disks, tapes and enclosures) sdparm can be used on
any device that uses a SCSI command set. Almost all CD/DVD
drives use the SCSI MMC set irrespective of the transport.
sdparm also can decode VPD pages including the device
identification page. Commands to start and stop the media;
load and unload removable media and some other housekeeping
functions are supported. sdparm supports both the linux
kernel 2.4 and 2.6 series with ports to FreeBSD, Solaris,
Tru64 and Windows.

      as descriptors
  - append relative target port identifier to SAS target
    port address with '-iq' option
  - add solaris port
  - place vendor specific data in sdparm_data_vendor.c
  - in the absence of an explicit transport or vendor,
    and if no match on mode page name or field, then try

  - add protocol-specific logical unit information VPD
    page (SAS)
  - use new sg_lib sg_get_num_nomult()
  - place source in subversion repository
