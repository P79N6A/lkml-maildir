Hi,
    I have been troubleshoting some scsi errors that I have been
recieving, and noticed something weird.  In my proc/pci my controller
card is identified as (I know obsolete).
-------
Bus  0, device  18, function  0:
    SCSI storage controller: NCR 53c810 (rev 18).
      Medium devsel.  IRQ 9.  Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min
Gnt=8.Max Lat=64.
      I/O at 0x6800 [0x6801].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe4000000 [0xe4000000].
-------
I then looked in the /proc/scsi/ncr53c8xx/0 file and it said
-------
General information:
  Chip NCR53C810a, device id 0x1, revision id 0x12
  IO port address 0x6800, IRQ number 9
  Using memory mapped IO at virtual address 0xc8902000
  Synchronous period factor 25, max commands per lun 32
---------
So which is it?  An 810 or 810A? Also sometimes I get the following
error when writing cdr's
--------
cdrecord: Input/output error. read track info: scsi sendcmd: retryable
error
CDB:  52 01 00 00 00 FF 00 00 1C 00
status: 0x2 (CHECK CONDITION)
Sense Bytes: 70 00 05 00 00 00 00 12 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 C0
Sense Key: 0x5 Illegal Request, Segment 0
Sense Code: 0x24 Qual 0x00 (invalid field in cdb) Fru 0x0
Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid) error refers to command part, bit ptr 0
(not valid) field ptr 0
--------
The drive is an HP 9200i, any ideas? The drive is terminated and is the
only drive on the scsi bus.  The strangest thing is that I have set the
scsi speed to Fast-5 Mb as fast 10 increases the frequency of this
error, and when I do a modprobe -a ncr53c8xx it spits out it is fast-10
and then when I do a modprobe -a sr_mod it detects it is a Fast-5.  Is
anyone else using the HP 9200i scsi drive? I don't think that it is a
scsi termination issue or cabling.
