Sorry..sorry...I'm saying that the recent device-mapper doesn't seem to
try to compile with 2.5.42, and was inquiring as to: 
1. Is it not supposed to work yet?
2. Are there any patches, to make this work as yet?
#2 is one of the main reasons I'm responding to this thread. I'm an
interested party for testing LVM2 on 2.5, but can't seem to get there.
There was discussion about using EVMS, but well, it didn't seem to work
as seamlessly as LVM upgrades had, and I've not had the time to trouble
shoot it till later this week.
