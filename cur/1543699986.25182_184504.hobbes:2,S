How confusing :(  Could you give me some idea how this works?  I have tried 
disable_irq(0) and, as best as I can tell, it does not do the trick.  The 
confusion I have is understanding where in the chain of hardware each of these 
thing is taking place.
For example, it would be "nice" if I could just turn off the PIT interrupt line 
so that both the NMI (PIT generated) and the PIT interrupt would be put on hold. 
  Your answer seems to indicate that disable_irq() is working down stream from 
where the NMI signal is connected to the PIT interrupt line, so we need to turn 
of the NMI as well.  A picture would be nice here :)
