I should've quoted the original bug report (kicking myself for those
fat fingers!): http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116599593200888&w=2
The bug manifested from an expectation that __put_ioctx can be called
in the softirq context, but it really shouldn't. Normally, aio_complete
will not decrement last ref count on ioctx, but under stressed system,
it might.

Yes, I agree and I would like to bring your patch on "DEFINE_WAIT..." back
too.  I will run that experiment.

Yeah, correctness absolutely over rule optimization.  I just hope I can
find a way to satisfy both.

I think I'm going to abandon this whole synchronize thing and going to
put the wake up call inside ioctx_lock spin lock along with the other
patch you mentioned above in the waiter path.  On top of that, I have
another patch attempts to perform wake-up only when the waiter can truly
proceed in aio_read_evt so dribbling I/O completion doesn't inefficiently
waking up waiter too frequently and only to have waiter put back to sleep
again. I will dig that up and experiment.
