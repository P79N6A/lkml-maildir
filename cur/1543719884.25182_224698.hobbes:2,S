In light of all of the problems with perfctr here, I've gone and done the
ifdef work for CONFIG_PERFCTR, presenting an alternative solution to the
struct problem...
http://triplehelix.org/~joshk/perfctr.diff
(note: this includes the earlier fix from wli as well, just for
convenience)
I realize that this might be a problem with regards to maintenance. Doing
this is kind of a pain in the ass.

Broke how? I hadn't seen these patches when I was initially fixing
problems with -rc2-mm1 overall. I even came up with a patch that made XFS
depend on QSORT and remove it from the fs/xfs/Makefile, but I guess that's
exactly what happened here...
Otherwise, XFS has to depend on !QSORT, and that might be bad if anyone
else depends on it. So what's the deal?
