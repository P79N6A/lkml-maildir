Sigh.  Shouldn't be too hard to deal with.

Yeah, it's been great fun :(.  On the other hand, I think its getting
there; the interactions between the various headers is getting more
comprehensible, and moving to a consistent use of inline functions
rather than a mixture of macros and inlines is making things more
deterministic.

Yeah, I tried doing it in smaller pieces, but its fairly difficult just
because its all so inter-tangled.  But I think its close now.
