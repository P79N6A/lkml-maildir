Andrew -- The use of the word 'hack' didn't trigger any response??
By hardcoding so much of the inquiry data, this patch -overwrites- valid 
inquiry data provided by the device, with generic data.  This patch 
makes generic the probe data that the SCSI layer -depends on to be 
different-.
Effectively you made one CD-ROM device work, killed all the others, and 
enabled an oops generator.
Good show.
Even if this patch worked, you still need to fix the following:
* Patch INQUIRY data -slightly- to fool the SCSI layer into working 
correctly.  This is what Andy's patch [poorly] attempts to address.
* Handling DRQ interrupts (early patch exists)
* Padding DMA data (50% patch exists)
* Fix error handling (patch exists)
* Fix all FIS-based drivers so that an error doesn't cause an oops
* Implement non-polled REQUEST SENSE error handling for FIS-based drivers
