I will post more info on Monday when I am able to power them up.
I'm not so sure the motherboard is broken, I am leaning more towards a 
misconfigured
bridge.  This computer is a 4U 19 inch rackmount chassis with a PCMIG 
CPU and a 12 slot PCI backplane.  I have done a lot of testing with this 
box trying to characterize this problem.  In one case I have put 3 Intel 
PRO 100S NICs on the secondary PCI bus and they ran under heavy stress 
test loads overnight.  The 4 port NIC seems to be the only card that 
doesnt want to cooperate.
