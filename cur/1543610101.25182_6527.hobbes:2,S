this is probably known already, but just in case, 2.4.14 compiling just
failed on me:

i wanted to upgrade because 2.4.13 has been flaky.  earlier today, my
system became very sloooow.  i killed just about every process with no
effect.   top reported that kswapd was taking 99% of the cpu.
then just a few minutes ago, my system hung (couldn't ssh in either).  at
the time, all i was running was g++ and mp3blaster.  wasn't even running X.
so i went to update to 2.4.14.  and the compile just failed.
no big deal -- i can live with it until 2.4.15 comes out, but i thought
someone should know about this.
no response is required.  i know how busy everyone here is.
