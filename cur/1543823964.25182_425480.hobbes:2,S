Thanks for the report, and thanks for testing.  The full demsg output
really helps.
It goes pear-shaped very early:

And from then on, ACPI is kaput.  So your interrupts are kaput, as is the
disk controller.
I had some of this happening too - it's due to some of the MM patches from
Mel and/or Andy.  I also managed to provoke "Too many memory regions,
truncating" out of it.
I hope that's all sorted out now.  Please test next -mm (hopefully
tomorrow) and let us know?
Or, if you're super-keen,
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/x.bz2
 is my current rollup
(against 2.6.17-rc4).  It was compilable this morning, but I've since
merged stuff ;) It would be interesting to know if that has fixed the bug.
