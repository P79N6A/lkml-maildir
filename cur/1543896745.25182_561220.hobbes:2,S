Hi Sam,
I was experiencing problems with my addons to the DATA_DATA macro,
declaring stuff in the .data section. It looked like: 
(vmlinux.lds.h) in -mm :
/* .data section */
#define DATA_DATA                                                       \
        *(.data)                                                        \
        *(.data.init.refok)                                             \
        . = ALIGN(8);                                                  \
        VMLINUX_SYMBOL(__start___markers) = .;                          \
        *(__markers)                                                    \
        VMLINUX_SYMBOL(__stop___markers) = .;
All this is declared within the .data section. However, I could not
declare a different section within this macro, because it is already
placed in a section; i.e.
(arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S) in -mm :
  . = ALIGN(4096);
  .data : AT(ADDR(.data) - LOAD_OFFSET) {       /* Data */
        DATA_DATA
        CONSTRUCTORS
        } :data
Using . = ALIGN(32); fixed my issue, but I wonder if there would be some
way to express the ".tracedata : AT(ADDR(.tracedata) - LOAD_OFFSET)"
that would automatically take care of alignment within this macro?
Thanks,
Mathieu
