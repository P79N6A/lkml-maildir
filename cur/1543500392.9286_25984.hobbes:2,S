2.3.x is clearly marked as development.  If you don't wish to see problems
such as this stick with 2.2.x untill 2.3.x comes out.  Development
relases are for breaking things.

This would be a good thing. Since development kernels tend to break they
should be used only by people who don't mind a little risk.
Had you actually gotten it to compile you would probably have seen the
disk corruption seen on the filesystems that compile alreaddy.  Consider
yourself saved and stick to the stable series.

PS Since I only have 1 box to test these things on I watch the list for
bug repors for 48 hours, if there are none relevent to my setup I upgrade.
This keeps me from jumping into the middle of updates to major portions of
the kernel.
