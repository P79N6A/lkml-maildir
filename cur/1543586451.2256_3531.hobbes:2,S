Miles, if the system is just sending the config info it may not be a
problem, but take the microsoft example, how do you know the bug report is
just sending info that is relevent to the system and not trying to
discover everything that you have installed in your system (in our case we
can't be looking for pirated software, but assuming that the bug report is
being sent as root how do you know that it's not sending out your password
file if it just send 'stuff' out)
