Hi,
I would like to open/read/write/close a regular file from my device
driver.
I think it would be possible, but I am confused, the "The Linux Kernel
Module Programming Guide" states that I can not use standard libraries
from within a module, I know the standard library ends up calling
system calls, but which calls should I use to deal with regular
files ?
I am developing a Ethernet driver and the Mac address configuration
