Early versions of stty made that mistake - to find out what settings your
printers had, you ended up printing the output of stty on paper.
If you're going to subvert an fd, use stdin, not stdout.
stdin is less valuable most commands use argv rather than stdin, and it
allows you to retreive the output of a command using the shell `backtick`
operators.
