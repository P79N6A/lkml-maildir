To save on the (indirect) function call, I would like to suggest:
	unsigned char **queue_numbers;
	queue_number = queue_numbers[major][minor];
That would require 256 bytes of storage for every major that is in use
in the system. That's two kilobytes for 8 majors in use. Acceptable
I'd say.
Adding just a teeny bit of "policy" in a central place:
	queue_number = queue_numbers[major][minor>>3];
reduces the amount of memory used by a factor of 8, but forces devices
to have the same queue for every 8 minor numbers (e.g. partitions on a
disk).
