In addition to what Arjan said - If you insist on doing it this way,
it would be nice if that generated Makefile could contain also
VERSION = 2
PATCHLEVEL = 6
so I can detect (by grepping that Makefile - or by some other method which
works on 2.0 - 2.6 kernels) which kbuild system I should use - whether 2.6.x, 
or 2.4.x, or standalone makefile for 2.2.x and 2.0.x. I see 
no way how to find what Makefile I should prepare for this thing.
Other possible solution is that you'll guarantee that this is last version
which will be ever invented. But you probably cannot guarantee this,
so some version number is needed.
