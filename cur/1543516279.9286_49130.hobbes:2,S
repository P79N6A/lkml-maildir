Actually, I believe they were looking for reasonable results
with connections to Mars:
From tcp_timer.c:
        tcp_retransmit_skb(sk, skb_peek(&sk->write_queue));
        /* Increase the timeout each time we retransmit.  Note that
         * we do not increase the rtt estimate.  rto is initialized
         * from rtt, but increases here.  Jacobson (SIGCOMM 88) suggests
         * that doubling rto each time is the least we can get away with.
         * In KA9Q, Karn uses this for the first few times, and then
         * goes to quadratic.  netBSD doubles, but only goes up to *64,
         * and clamps at 1 to 64 sec afterwards.  Note that 120 sec is
         * defined in the protocol as the maximum possible RTT.  I guess
         * we'll have to use something other than TCP to talk to the
         * University of Mars.
         *
         * PAWS allows us longer timeouts and large windows, so once
         * implemented ftp to mars will work nicely. We will have to fix
         * the 120 second clamps though!
         */
        tp->backoff++;
        tp->rto = min(tp->rto << 1, 120*HZ);
        tcp_reset_xmit_timer(sk, TIME_RETRANS, tp->rto);
        tcp_write_timeout(sk);

Hmm...  Move to Mars?  ;o)
