  Hi, all. It looks like there is a potential security hole in the new
shmfs code. In ipc/shm.c:sys_shmat() the root directory is temporarily
changed for a while. A CLONE_FS clone can then come in and take
advantage of this exposure. This needs to be fixed.
This is in 2.3.99-pre2.
Frankly, I'd rather see the old SysV IPC code restored, especially
since we're so close to 2.4. At least it's a known quantity.
