Subject: patch to avoid declaring irq_desc on ia64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

My understanding is that the big irq.c unification is still being
worked on.  Until that happens, would you mind accepting the attached
patch?  The CONFIG_IA64 is of course not ideal, but it will trivially
disappear once the unified irq.c work is in.
This change is, I believe, the last one that prevents ia64 from
compiling out of the box (apart from the show_stack() patches which
are already in Andrew's tree).

PS: Yes, I could work around the problem by changing the irq_desc()
    macro name to something else.  But that would be lot of wasted
    effort given that the unified irq.c will also be using a macro of
    the same name.
