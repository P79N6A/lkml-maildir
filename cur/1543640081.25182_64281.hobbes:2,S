I see a benign race but no oops.

I agree that B may get to mark_page_accessed before A gets to
lru_cache_add, but B will just SetPageReferenced.  If there's a
similar process C racing on the page too, its mark_page_accessed
would call activate_page, but that will see !PageLRU and do nothing.

It cannot be made PageActive until after lru_cache_add has set PageLRU.
