One thought I had is that "fastcall" doesn't really mean the right
thing.  The speed or otherwise of the call is a side-effect, but what we
really mean is something like "regparm".  Ie, document the actual
calling convention used, rather than an effect of the calling convention.
I guess "fastcall" has enough history now.
