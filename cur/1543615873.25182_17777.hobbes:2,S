Subject: [PATCH] hashed waitqueues, somewhat cleaner
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some new versions of the hashed waitqueues are now available:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/wli/vm/struct_page/waitq-2.4.17-rmap10c-1
This includes:
(1) Manual common subexpression elimination of page_waitqueue() calls
(2) Use a 64-bit Fibonacci hashing prime conditional on BITS_PER_LONG
(3) Storing wait_table_shift instead of wait_table_bits to reduce
	arithmetic within the hash function
(4) Eliminating the masking operation within the hash function, as
	the shifting already zeroes the high-order bits.
(5) Eliminating explicit references to struct page ->wait outside
	of the VM.
Future directions:
(1) Using a non-linear function to size the waitqueue table given the
	size of a zone, as the demand for waitqueues does not appear to
	scale linearly with the size of memory.
(2) Finding bit-sparse Fibonacci hashing multipliers for machines with
	slow integer multiplies (so it can be optimized to shift/add
	sequences on those machines).
I'll followup shortly after rediffing against 2.4.17-mainline.
Cheers,
Bill
