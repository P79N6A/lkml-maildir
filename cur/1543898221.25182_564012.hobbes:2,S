Subject: [PATCH][XFS][resend] memory leak; allocated transaction not freed in xfs_inactive_free_eofblocks() in failure case.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

(this is back from May 16 2007, resending since it doesn't look like 
the patch ever made it in anywhere)
Fix XFS memory leak; allocated transaction not freed in xfs_inactive_free_eofblocks() in failure case.
the code allocates a transaction, but in the case where 'truncate' is
!=0 and xfs_itruncate_start(ip, XFS_ITRUNC_DEFINITE, 0); happens to return
an error, we'll just return from the function without dealing with the
memory allocated byxfs_trans_alloc() and assigned to 'tp', thus it'll be
orphaned/leaked - not good.
