"should be" is yes and yes, but you will not see 30MB/s and there is no actual difference between
/dev/hda and /dev/had1.

I've spent more time with real world data transfer testing than god, both PIIX4-based motherboards
and network based (Network Appliance <-> linux).  The only hdparm parameter that makes any
measurable, significnat difference for most modern drive and chipset combinations is -d1 and the
correct UDMA mode.
Try partitioning your disk in 4 equal segments and run multiple tests in runlevel1 on /dev/hda[1-4]
for '/usr/bin/time hdparm -tT' plus permutations of -a[0248]c[013]m[024816]u[01],
and /usr/bin/time dd if=/dev/hda[1-4] of=/dev/null bs=1k count={32,64,128,256,512,1024}k.
