One issue you need to be careful about is that long long has different
alignment between 32bit and 64bit on ia64 and x86-64. On sparc64/mips64/ppc64
etc. that isn't the case. The x86-64 handlers convert sometimes more than
the later ones because of that.
Also some ioctl handlers are endian dependent, at least in x86-64 (I think
I commented them all). Not sure if Dave did the same.
First step probably is to just get register_ioctl32_translation into
a common header and implementation file.
