100% agreed with you Jan, menuconfig is excellent. I was even thinking
that it would be really cool if someone could extract Kbuild from the
kernel and produce an independant framework to make it easier to include
in other projects. I would really like to be able to launch a "make
menuconfig" or "make oldconfig" with my own softs, and see only what
has changed being rebuilt. Think about all the people who get nervous
when "./configure" does not produce what they want...
Another project I was thinking about is a "smart" patch utility. Right
now, "patch" works line by line. While this may be understandable for
"patch", it's pretty annoying to see the same behaviour in "merge".
Why not have a smarter pair of tools which would be able to detect
changes in consecutive lines, or even merge changes on the same line ?
merge cannot even merge two changes on consecutive makefile entries
right now, which has an impact on git's ability to merge changes.
For instance, as an exercise to teach git to a friend, I used the
following file :
a=1
b=1
c=1
Then, branch b changes b=1 to b=2, and branch c, c=1 to c=2. You cannot
merge them automatically, which is a shame. So there is room for improvement
here :-)

Willy
