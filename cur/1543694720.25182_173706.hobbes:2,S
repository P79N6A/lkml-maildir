Which is okay, if you are doing this, you are not trying to "save" the
disk, you are trying to save the data... Which reminds me I should
back up hitachi hdd in my notebook. It already hates me for the stuff
I done with it. [Take a walk with running notebook in bag because this
damn beast pretends to be powered off, and will magically come back
few seconds later... Run notebook at near critical temperature for ~10
hours -- resulting in severe disk errors because drive failed to
detect it is overheated and tried to operate....]
