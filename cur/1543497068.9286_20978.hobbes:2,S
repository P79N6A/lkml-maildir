 Dear Colleagues
  I removed the following system calls in the sched.c file:
           1- sys_sched_setscheduler
           2- sys_sched_getscheduler
           3- sys_sched_get_priority_max
           4- sys_sched_get_priority_min
           5- sys_sched_setparam
           6- sys_sched_getparam
 I also removed their references in the files listed below.
           1- /usr/src/linux/include/asm/unistd.h
           2- /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/entry.S
OBS: the line ".space (NR_syscalls-169)*4" was changed to
              ".space (NR_syscalls-163)*4".
                      and
     the numbers of each system call was appropriately corrected in the mentioned files.
 After that I used the commands: make dep, make clean and make zImage.
 When I reboot the system I found a loop there ...exactly at the point:
 "/dev/hda2:clean,42389/1357824files,631159/5429970 blocks"
 The next message should be "loading modules", but the system halted before.
 Could you help me ??
 Are there more steps to remove a system call ??
 Best regards,
 Livia Catarina.
