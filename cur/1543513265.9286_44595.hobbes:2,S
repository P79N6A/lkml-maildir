Subject: 2.2.12 ping off by one...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After about a day of uptime using 2.2.12 *WITH* patch applied to
fix kernel bug - from AC, we noticed a slowdown in networking.
DNS queries then started failing slowly.  I did a ping, and got
what follows below...  If you look at the error messages, it
shows that the wrong data that is received is off by one in every
case.  It is one less than it should be.
This could be caused by the remote OS, or perhaps by some machine
in the middle, however I suspect that it is in fact my Linux
machine hosing something along the way.
Is this a known bug?  I am *NOT* using VMware, nor have I had the
modules loaded at all this time before someone asks.  I say that
just so that I don't get ignored under assumptions.
I know 2.2.12 has bugs, and I believe I've got all patches
applied.  I'm using a kernel compiled with egcs - the one that
comes with RedHat 6.0.
Please let me know if this is a known thing that is fixed
allready, or if more info is needed, or if I should take a long
walk off a short dock...
Here is the ping:
