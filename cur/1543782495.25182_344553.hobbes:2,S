True, I didn't notice that.

OK, well I would prefer you do the proper atomic operations throughout
where it "really matters" in file_table.c, and do your lazy synchronize
with just the sysctl exported value.
Unless the fs people had a problem with that.
And you may as well get rid of the atomic_inc_return which can be more
expensive on some platforms and doesn't buy you much.
   atomic_inc;
   atomic_read;
Should be enough if you don't care about lost updates here, yeah?
