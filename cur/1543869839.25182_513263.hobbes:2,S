What about adding a layer below do_gettimeofday() which just scheds the
adjustment process? That might be reasonable .. The NMI, and userspace
cases aren't very compelling right now, at least I'm not convinced a
whole new timing interface is needed ..
The latency tracing system in the -rt branch modifies the gettimeofday
facilities , I'm not sure of the correctness of it but it gets called
from anyplace in the kernel including NMI's . 
Here's the function,
cycle_t notrace get_monotonic_cycles(void)
{
        cycle_t cycle_now, cycle_delta;
        /* read clocksource: */
        cycle_now = clocksource_read(clock);
        /* calculate the delta since the last update_wall_time: */
        cycle_delta = (cycle_now - clock->cycle_last) & clock->mask;
        return clock->cycle_last + cycle_delta;
}
That looks safe. When converting this to nanoseconds you would still get
the time adjustments but it would be all at once instead of in little
increments ..
