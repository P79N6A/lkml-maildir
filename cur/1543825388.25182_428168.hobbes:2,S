Depends entirely on the driver, and that point we've typically lost the
fact that this is a read-ahead request and could just be tossed. In
fact, the entire request may consist of read-ahead as well as normal
read entries.
For ide-cd, it tends do only end the first part of the request on a
medium error. So you may see a lot of repeats :/
