This would be even more fragile.  The exact format of GCC's
assembler code output isn't defined at all, so in principle
this is a hopeless task.  In practice just putting the
.code16gcc directive on the first line would likely work
though, GCC never generates a .code32 AFAIK, but it isn't
guaranteed that this will work (or will keep working).

-fno-unit-at-a-time is the default on three year old compilers,
yes.  Newer compilers have unit-at-a-time enabled by default.

An asm() outside of a function is a top-level thing, just
like functions and file-scope variable definitions, and with
unit-at-a-time compilation all such blocks can be reordered
(or even omitted, or inlined, or whatever).  Note that even
before unit-at-a-time was introduced there was no guarantee
of emitting everything in the order it appears in the source
file.
