OK. We have now just one single place where IDE_DMA gets unset ->
udma_stop. This to too early to reset IDE_BUSY. However it well
may be that ide_dma_intr() simply doesn't care about IDE_BUSY.
Let's have a look...

Well lets look at ata_irq_intr, the end of it:
	 * Note that handler() may have set things up for another
	 * interrupt to occur soon, but it cannot happen until
	 * we exit from this routine, because it will be the
	 * same irq as is currently being serviced here, and Linux
	 * won't allow another of the same (on any CPU) until we return.
	 */
	if (startstop == ide_stopped) {
		if (!ch->handler) {	/* paranoia */
			clear_bit(IDE_BUSY, ch->active);
			do_request(ch);
		} else {
			printk("%s: %s: huh? expected NULL handler on exit\n", drive->name, __FUNCTION__);
		}
	} else if (startstop == ide_released)
		queue_commands(drive);
I think the above needs more tough now...
