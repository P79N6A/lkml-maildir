What about splitting machines like routing "*.de" to a couple
of alternative *.de relays (Donations ?)
With "sendmail" someone could to this with the mailertable
like .de		EMSPT:[alternative.de.relay.de]
Then the machine should send ONE mail to the *.de relay with
loads of rcpt lines possibly even with smtp pipelining
and the load for all recipients in the *.de domain
is off the machine ...
This could be done redundant - sendmail does this
by [alt1.de.relay.de]:[alt2.de.relay.de]:[alt3.de.relay.de]
Now someone should evaluate what specs these machines should
have - To the end of the week ill be able to have a machine up
and running where this could be done (preferred MTA is postfix)
