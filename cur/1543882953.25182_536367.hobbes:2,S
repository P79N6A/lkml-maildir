The static quirk list uses idVendor == 0 to mark the end of 
hid_blacklist[], so we don't expect any device to have idVendor == 0.  If 
a device is correctly presenting with idVendor == 0, we need a different 
way to terminate that blacklist.  Either that or there's an upper-layer 
bug, as you write.
Regarding its placement: that WARN_ON() belongs in the static quirk lookup 
code, rather than where it is now.  Its current location must be a relic 
of an earlier patchset.

No.  There shouldn't be any functional problem with removing that 
WARN_ON(), and also removing the initial if() in usbhid_lookup_dquirk().
