I personally consider K&R prototypes to be useless, and downright evil. 
Any project who still has them is either lazy or still living in the 80's, 
and in either case I don't see any reason not to clean up the kernel side.
Besides, I'm not aware of any reason to ever really sync with zlib on that
level (the kinds of syncs I do foresee would be security issues or similar
if some exploit is found, but that's unlikely to be a major sync).
We've historically done other surgery to the zlib sources to make them a
bit more readable at times (the zlib allocator was just doing ridiculous
things, the kernel version was changed to allocate small structures
directly on the stack and embed others statically).
