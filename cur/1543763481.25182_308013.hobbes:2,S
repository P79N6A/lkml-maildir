The problem is in ensuring that access really is as restricted as you
think it is.  How will you deal with removable devices, and network
filesystems?  We really don't want all the concerns associated with
the SUID/SGID bits in yet another place.
Most importantly, though, hacks like this to work around bugs in
applications is not the proper thing to do.
