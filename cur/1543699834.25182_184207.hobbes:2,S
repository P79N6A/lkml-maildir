I have manage to reproduce this on a more down-to-earth setup.  I am running
an old RS6k-170 box with one Power3-II chip running at 450MHz and 1Gb RAM. 
In this setup I'm only using two filesystem and the problem still shows up
just about when I'm running out of free pages on the server.
Can anybody provide me with some tips as to how to debug this a bit further?
Really want to figure out if this is a NFS bug or a JFS one.
Thanks
