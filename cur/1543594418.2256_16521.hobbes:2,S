Yes, plugging the drive into the primary VIA IDE port, it seems to work 
perfectly. Am now on 2.4.5-ac14 with UDMA5 enabled and it seems quite happy.
Which would seem to indicate that yes, it *is* a Promise issue - or at 
least a Promise-on-VIA issue.
FWIW the Promise BIOS announces itself as version 2.01 build 35.
erk...
Thus far I've been presuming that the Promise IDE ports were 
UDMA100/66/33 and the VIA IDE ports were UDMA66/33, and thus naturally 
wanted to use the Promise ports to get better performance. Now, on more 
careful reading of the manual, it seems to be telling me that *all* of 
the IDE ports are UDMA100/66/33, the main benefit of the Promise chip 
besides being able to plug more IDE devices in, being the RAID 0 support 
(which I don't need [yet]). Then, on looking again at the bonnie 
*results* (rather than just noting that it hadn't *crashed*), I notice 
that the figures are about the same, possibly marginally better, than 
those I was getting out of the Promise ports.
And there I thought I'd have to be slumming it... Doh! :-} <sheepish/>
