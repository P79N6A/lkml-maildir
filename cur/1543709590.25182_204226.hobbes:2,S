I get nothing in /var/log/dmesg and in /var/log/messages
In /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info I get:
[olaf@venus olaf]$ cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info
CD-ROM information, Id: cdrom.c 3.20 2003/12/17

Can write MRW:          0       0       1
The one I'm mounting is /dev/scd1.
As there is capablity to write-protect DVD-RAM disk (like a 1.44"
Floppy), I think that the linux kernel interprets some message from
device in wrong way.
