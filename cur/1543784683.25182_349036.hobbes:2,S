Because it does not build a build-support program.
That would be the last place where one would look for
rules to build asm-offsets.h for example.
When the functionalty to start the recursive build of all kernel
directories are moved to top-level Kbuild the location in the
top-level directory makes even more sense.
Same goes when the post processing steps are moved to the top-level
Kbuild file. Here we again will benefit form having the full kbuild
funtionality available.

A makefile is a file that does something intelligent when used as input
to make. It is long time since this property did not hold for the
kernel.
The Kbuild name is a much more natural name in the respect that it
tells you this file contain kbuild info. So one know when browsing
a directory structure that a Kbuild file is input to kbuild, and follow
a much more strict syntax than ordinary Makefiles.
