Subject: (trivia) remove useless typecast around `jif' variable

in fs/proc/proc_misc.c:show_stat() routine (which handles /proc/stat
file), there's a local variable named 'jif' of type unsigned long,
declared as following:
static int show_stat(struct seq_file *p, void *v)
{
        unsigned long jif;
But later on, it's explicitly casted to (unsigned long) in printf().
Remove the useless cast, to let the compiler to do the work for us
in case we'll want to use different type here (say, u64 or something).
