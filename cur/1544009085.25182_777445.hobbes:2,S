We already have the scheduler instrucmentation, so correlating that to
known futex calls (from userspace) shouldn't be too hard.

lockdep only does kernel-internal locks - so no.

Not sure we should, Thomas did the bulk of that ftrace debugging, Thomas
do you think it would be worthwhile to add some tracepoints in there?
