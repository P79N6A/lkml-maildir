But no single makefile. Or what CC and options do not mater really?
You can easily find in your server's apache logs, my visit of that
archive in the day of my message (today i just confirmed my assertions):
browser lynx, host flower.upol.cz.

Fortunately to me, `lighthttpd' is real-life *and* in the benchmark
area also. Just see that site how much there was measured: different OSes,
special tunning. *That* is i'm talking about. Epoll _wrapper_ there,
is 3461 byte long, your answer to _me_ 2580. People are bringing you a
test bed, with all set up ready to use; need less code, go on, comment
needless out!

I think that called open source, linux kernel case.

Hmm. Let me answer on that "dup" with stuff from LKML archive. That
will reveal, that my guesses were told by The Big Jury to you already:

As example, after have read some books on TCP/IP and Ethernet, internal
help of `ip' was all i needed to know.

You know who proposed that, and you know how many (few) releases ago.

I didn't think, that my message was offensive. Also i didn't even say,
that you have not bothered feed your code to "scripts/Lindent".
