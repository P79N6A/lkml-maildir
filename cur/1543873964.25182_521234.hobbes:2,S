The TSC is checked for synchronization between the CPUs. It's nothing to
worry about. We switch off the TSC and use a different clocksource.
Is this after resume ? If yes, then something (probably BIOS) is
fiddling with the TSC of one CPU when the resume happens.

I sent a patch for this yesterday:

This is unrelated to suspend / resume. The local apic timers stop
(hardware madness), when the CPU enters C3 power state. In this case we
switch to HPET (or PIT when HPET is not available) and broadcast the
events via Inter Processor Interrupts. This is nothing to worry about. 
I'm a bit surprised though, that your system was in periodic mode before
suspend and switched to one shot mode on resume.
Is this reproducible ? If yes, can you please provide the dmesg output
from boot to resume ?

Sure, just s/shoot/shot/ :)

So dynticks are working as expected.
