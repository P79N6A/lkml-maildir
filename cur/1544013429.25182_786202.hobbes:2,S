I don't want to merge pure code cleanup patches, because :
  1) it brings no added value to the final user
  2) there's always a risk of regression
The only exception I accept to make is when I resync a file with 2.6 in
order to ease future patches.
However, I welcome cleanups which come with other changes/fixes, provided
they're not too invasive.

Willy
