Rik has been waiting for an excuse to get deferred swapout into the
mainline.  Sounds like we've got the excuse.

Unfortunately, there is one common case where we want to do exactly
that.  "dd < /dev/zero > something_using_raw_io" maps a whole series
of identical readonly ZERO_PAGE pages into the kiobuf.  One of the
reasons I removed the automatic page locking was that otherwise we're
forced to special-case things like ZERO_PAGE in the locking code.
Even ignoring that, users _will_ submit multiple IOs in the same page.
Pinning the physical page with page->count is clean.  Doing the
locking with the page lock makes no sense if you have adjacent IOs or
if you want to maintain the kiobuf mapping for any length of time.
The point of kiobufs was to avoid VM hacks so that IO can be done at
physical page level.  Pinning ptes should not have anything to do with
the IO or we've lost that abstraction.

Right.

Not the whole of access_one_page, but the pagetable-locked
follow-page / handle_mm_fault loop should be common code.  That's
where we're having the problem, so let's avoid having to maintain it
in two places.
Cheers,
