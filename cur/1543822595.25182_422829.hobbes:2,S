  Hm, I wonder what would be the effect of having the external mutex
and __data.__lock use a PI futex and __data.__futex use a regular
futex when the waiters on __data.__futex are requeued on the external
mutex during a broadcast.

  Just a wild guess here, but in the broadcast or signal path, couldn't
__data.__mutex be looked up to determine what protocol to use for the
__data.__futex?

  As a corolary to the above couldn't the protocol used by the external
mutex dictates what the __data.__futex should use (PI or not)?
Maybe there is a need for something like a futex_requeue_pi() otherwise
we'll end up mixing PI and non-PI futexes or maybe I'm not understanding
the thing.
  Sébastien.
