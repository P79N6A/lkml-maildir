Like david, both parts of the patch look good but i haven't tested
on either parisc or ia64. I don't have time right now to work on
2.5.x issues :^(
I looked at 2.5.54 to check if everything was ok and found
another nit:
    grundler <510>fgrep pci_scan_bus *.[ch]
    probe.c:struct pci_bus * __devinit pci_scan_bus_parented(struct device *parent, int bus, struct pci_ops *ops, void *sysdata)
    probe.c:EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_scan_bus);
and :
    grundler <514>fgrep pci_scan_bus include/linux/*h
    include/linux/pci.h:struct pci_bus *pci_scan_bus_parented(struct device *parent, int bus, struct pci_ops *ops, void *sysdata);
    include/linux/pci.h:static inline struct pci_bus *pci_scan_bus(int bus, struct pci_ops *ops, void *sysdata)
    include/linux/pci.h:    return pci_scan_bus_parented(NULL, bus, ops, sysdata);
Can the EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_scan_bus) be removed now?
BTW, thanks to whoever introduced pci_scan_bus_parented().
It's exactly what parisc code needed (lba_pci.c and dino.c use it).
I think just go ahead with your patches and we'll fix up the arch specific
stuff to follow. I'm convinced it's the right direction.
thanks,
grant
