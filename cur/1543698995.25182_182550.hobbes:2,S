Subject: XFS merged in 2.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

FYI
Christoph reviewed XFS patch which changed generic code, and it was
stripped down later to a set of changes which dont modify the code
behaviour (except for a few bugfixes which should have been included
separately anyway) and are pretty obvious.
So its that has been merged, along with fs/xfs/.
