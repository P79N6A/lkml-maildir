Uli Weigand has put some work into making the 'Multiple Address
Spaces' feature of Embedded C work with gcc. We need that in order
to address the process address space from a program running on an SPU
on Cell, but it should syntactically be the same thing we need for
__user, __iomem, etc. I.e., iit follows the same rules as 'const'
and 'volatile' qualifiers.
AFAIK, the infrastructure for this is supposed to go into gcc-4.3,
but has not been posted publically yet. If you add something like
this to sparse, it would be good to keep it compatible with the
new gcc extension, so that gcc can do the right thing at some point
in the future for the kernel.
Uli, can you point us to any public code or specfication about the
multiple address spaces feature?
