	Fix from ac16 (avoid corrupting the lock_depth).
	(recommended)
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa2: 00_max-threads-1
	Each task is going to take more than 2 pages. There's
	also the pid limit and the per-user limit but turning
	the default down is good idea. Fix from Rik from ac16.
	(recommended)
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa2: 00_swapinfo-1
	Only show deviecs when then swap_map is been allocated
	to avoid oops during swapon. Fix from
	Paul Menage <pmenage@ensim.com>.
	(nice to have)
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa1/30_tux: 30_atomic-lookup-3
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa2/30_tux: 30_atomic-lookup-4
	Introduce O_ATOMICLOOKUP for ppc equal to 01000000.
Only in 2.4.6pre3aa2: 40_experimental/40_blkdev-pagecache-3
	Optional patch to apply to move the blkdev from buffercache to
	pagecache. At the moment this breaks the ramdisk and in turn initrd.
	Read the 40_experimental/README for more details. Like the tux patches
	this one is not included into the global diff (2.4.6pre3aa2.{gz,bz2}).
