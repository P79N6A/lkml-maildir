I agree this 'optimization' is not "good" (I was the guy who suggested it 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/30/4
 )
After Eric Biederman message (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/30/292
) I remember 
adding some stat counters and telling Greg to not put the patch in because 
kref_put() was mostly called with refcount=1. But the patch did its way. I 
*did* ask Greg to revert it, but cannot find this mail archived somewhere...
But I believe Venkatesh problem comes from its release() function : It is 
supposed to free the object.
If not, it should properly setup it so that further uses are OK.
ie doing in release(kref)
atomic_set(&kref->count, 0);
