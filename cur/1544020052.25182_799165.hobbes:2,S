Subject: [PATCH 2/2] softlockup: check all tasks in hung_task
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/30/271

Instead of checking only hung_task_check_count tasks, all tasks are checked.
hung_task_check_count is still used to put an upper bound on the critical
section. Every hung_task_check_count checks, the critical section is
refreshed. Keeping the critical section small minimizes time preemption is
disabled and keeps rcu grace periods small.
To prevent following a stale pointer, get_task_struct is called on g and t.
To verify that g and t have not been unhashed while outside the critical
section, the task states are checked.
The design was proposed by Frédéric Weisbecker.
