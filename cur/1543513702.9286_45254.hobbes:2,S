The block device layer certainly likes to talk to devices with 2^n blocks
sizes, but you shouldn't need to worry about that.  If you're writing a
filesystem interface for the Rio, then it should be an NFS-like filesystem
rather than a ext2-like filesystem; that is, it isn't associated with a block
device, and isn't layered on the buffer cache.  If you want to use the page
cache, then you can map the Rio blocks into cache pages in any way you like.

What sort of stuff?  Do you mean fiddling with printer port control bits?  It
depends on what sort of accuracy you need, and what kinds of delays.  If its
just a few microseconds here and there you can use udelay; if you need to do
things like "wait at least 2ms" then you can use a blocking sleep.
