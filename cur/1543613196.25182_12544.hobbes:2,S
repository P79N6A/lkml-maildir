I have never tested it vs a NT server with more than 3G of disc, but it's
a 64bit offset so it should be a bit more ... I'll try and dig up a
machine with more space to test with.
It is possible that the readX/writeX SMB is used incorrectly and that
while it does make the low 32 bits be unsigned the top 32 bits are set to
0.
But I have tested it with >4G files on samba servers and that seemed to
work. You did patch smbmount too?
