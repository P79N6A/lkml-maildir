/proc/mounts has
/dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0
/dev/hda6 /home ext3 rw 0 0
However, tune2fs -l on both /dev/hda1 (the root filesystem) and /dev/hda6 gives
Filesystem features:      has_journal sparse_super
How do  fix the situation at this stage? I am using Redhat 7.2 with kernel
2.4.9-13
Thanks for your help,
Zvi.
