    Sam> Nitpicking.
Great, thanks for the help :)  I'll fix these up before our next
version of the patches are posted.
    Sam> It's more readable to keep .o files on one line.
OK, I will reformat our Makefiles.  (I used the old style because it's
easier to add/remove source files, but I think you're right that it's
better to optimize for readability rather than the rare event of
adding/removing sources)
    Sam> For new stuff please use ib_core-y :=
OK, no problem (until a few days ago I didn't even know -y was
equivalent to -obj, let alone preferred).

Right now all the code is in drivers/infiniband.  However Christoph
suggested moving the .h files to include/infiniband as well.  I have
no problem moving the includes (and as you point out this eliminates
having to add a -I to our CFLAGS), but on the other hand do we want to
add a new toplevel include directory for what is still admittedly a
minor subsystem?
Thanks,
  Roland
