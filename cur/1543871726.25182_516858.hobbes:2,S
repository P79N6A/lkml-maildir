We're still inside manage_mutex, so we guarantee that no-one else is
changing it.

Yes, I think so. Unless every memory allocator was to hold a lock for
the duration of alloc_pages(), number_of_cpusets can theoretically be
out of date by the time you're using it. But since the process could
have allocated just before you created the first cpuset and moved it
into that cpuset anywa, it's not really a race (and the consequences
are inconsequential).
