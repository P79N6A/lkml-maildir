I would guess that it could also be a problem with a wide variety of  
Perl CGIs running under Apache2+mod_perl with the worker threading  
model.  In fact this may actually explain some odd behavior I got  
from one such module that I "fixed" by switching to logging via  
syslog.  I don't remember which module it was or what the exact  
problem was, but I think it seemed similar in nature.  That is  
somewhat of a surprising and nonintuitive failure mode for logging,  
IMHO it would be nice to get fixed.  I would imagine that this has  
probably been hit a number of times before, mysteriously fixed by  
changed userspace locking or subtle thread ordering, and written off  
as the mysterious effects of cosmic rays on RAM.
