Strange, I am using the i810 in DRM option.  However, I am not using 
OpenGL anything and it is an older box that this problem occurred on.  A 
Dell Optiplex GX1 700MHZ P3 I believe.  Anyhow, I tried this work-around:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1467
Will see if it crashes again..

Further investigations revealed that adding
Option "NoAccel" "true" to xorg.conf resolves the problem which means it's 
a dri
problem.
The following dmesg output occurs when the X server crashs:
[drm:i810_wait_ring] *ERROR* space: 65512 wanted 65528
[drm:i810_wait_ring] *ERROR* lockup
[drm:i810_wait_ring] *ERROR* space: 65504 wanted 65528
[drm:i810_wait_ring] *ERROR* lockup
And from time to time (I think it's when i'm switching consoles while the 
X
server hangs with a black screen):
[drm:i810_unlock] *ERROR* Process 6632 using kernel context 0
/var/log/Xorg.0.log contains one warning but no errors:
(WW) I810(0): Bad V_BIOS checksum
I'm allocating 12288KB VideoRam otherwise DRI does not work for me (at 
least not
with 8192 or no VideoRam setting in xorg.conf).
If you need further informations tell me please. Happy new year besides...
