So?
When I look at a man page, *at least* 50% of the time I'd like to know if  
this is in any way Linux specific (and if so, in what way), and what  
exactly are the portable properties.
I may then decide to rely on non-portable properties, if those make a  
significant difference to what I'm trying to do.
Or I may prefer to keep it portable.
In any case, to do that, I *MUST* know what the portable aspects are.

Misleading. They should *explain* portability insofar as it relates to the  
manpage subject.

False. Portability of system features *is* an important aspect of  
documenting those features, just as much as pointing out related features  
is (SEE ALSO).

I've done that. Neither tells more than half the story at best.

That is a seriously stupid comment. Especially given that political  
correctness is actually highly *un*-portable.

And how do you decide to do one or the other? Right ... you rely on  
documentation that explains what doing so actually entails.

Those are, of course, portability comments. (What, you didn't realize that  
moving between raw syscalls, libc5, and various glibc versions, is also a  
case of porting?)

But then one might realize the hard way that portability even between  
similar Linux versions suddenly becomes a problem.
