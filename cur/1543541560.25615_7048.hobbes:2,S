... then GNOME can take a hike. No matter what mechanisms are there. It
just should not be done. If you want a program with delusions of OShood -
fine, but some of us just fscking had it with EMACS. And that's completely
regardless of the kernel/userland mechanisms - doing that is Wrong. Any
program that wants to do that deserves only one treatment:
% cat /usr/bin/foo
#!/bin/sh
echo "foo: banned on that system. Rationale: blatant misdesign."
^D
% chattr +i /usr/bin/foo
followed by rm on all other files it had installed. And that goes for any
program - not just GNOME.
