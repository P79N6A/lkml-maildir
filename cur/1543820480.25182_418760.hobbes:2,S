Are you sure this can't race against the hardware?
Something like this:
Kernel                               Hardware
- generate fake IRQ
- enter the low level IRQ handling
                                     - hardware generates an IRQ and
                                       sets it's IRQ reason registers
                                       to "I have smthng to do"
- enter the handler and service
  the IRQ
- return SA_HANDLED
