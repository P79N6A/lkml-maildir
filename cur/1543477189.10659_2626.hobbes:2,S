Yep.  This is to avoid the jiffy wrap problem.

That's the traditional way, and it breaks after ~670 days (not often a
problem if your power supply is anything like ours :)
Late 2.1 (and the 2.2pre kernels) have a new function schedule_timeout()
which deals with this requirement.
If you need more complicated things, then there are time_before(),
time_after(), time_before_eq() and time_after_eq() macros which are
jiffy-wrap-safe.

Nope, you're on the right track with the linux-kernel list.
