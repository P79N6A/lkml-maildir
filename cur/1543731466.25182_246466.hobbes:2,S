  I  am  thinking  that  is  there  was a proper API for accessing the
  filesystem  then this problem wouldn't arise because things could be
  done  behind  the curtains inside the API, instead of having all the
  tools to be rewritten to know.
  Think of FAT32, for example, the new filenames will be retained even
  if  you use old tools on them. It is only if you mount it as a FAT16
  volume they will be lost.
  Even  if  this  is fixed for Reiser4 now. Next time someone wants to
  make  changes like this we have the exact same problem yet again.
