Ask me for the GPL code that I wrote as the author, that am working on at
the rates define.  I will tell you to go right to hell on a bobsled!
Oh and I will push to make sure you do not waste time getting there.
You are being a total ASS.
As the author of GPL code I have the right to pull the GPL if I wish and
never update or publish the updates, and YOU have not legal authority to
force me to send you SHIT!  Does that make it real clear or not?
Later,
