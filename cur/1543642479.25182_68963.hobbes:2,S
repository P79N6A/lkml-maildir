   The fact that we're doing something different from everyone else
   and turning up a different set of kernel issues is a good thing, 
   to my mind. You're right, we could use Tux if we wanted to ... but
   that doesn't stop Apache being interesting ;-)
Tux does not obviate Apache from the equation.
See my other emails.
