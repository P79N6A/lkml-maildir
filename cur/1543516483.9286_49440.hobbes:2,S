The answer, as you suspect, is yes and no. For a file descriptor
to mean anything, you need a "process context". Therefore, if you
need to handle files within the kernel, you need a "kernel thread".
Therefore, you can't just open()/read()/write()/close() files within
the kernel. Further, when file I/O is occurring, the process needs
to be able to sleep. This means that your driver module has to be
very careful about locks.
Presently, a kernel thread may not be able to be created from a module.
This further complicates things. This means that, to handle files, the
kernel thread has to be part of the kernel.
Since more and more persons seem to need file-handling capability
within modules, maybe it's time to create a generic file-handling
kernel thread with which all modules communicate when they need
file capability. This kernel thread would act as a file-server,
performing file I/O on behalf of the client, the module.
