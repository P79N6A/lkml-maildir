Hi Matt,
        I avoid typing even a single character of optimization until it's 
justified.  This is partially a reaction against the machoptimization 
tendencies of many kernel programmers, but it's mainly a concern at the 
kernel's complexity creep.
Meanwhile, of course, I've now spent far too long analyzing this :)
Building a 1000 byte string 1 byte at a time involves 6 reallocs (SLAB) or 10 
reallocs (SLUB).  Frankly, that's good enough without an explicit alloc 
length field (better in some ways).
As to keeping an explicit length vs strlen(): those 1000 calls on my test 
machine take 1491ns per call with an explicit length vs 1496ns per call with 
strlen().  That's not worth 4 bytes, let alone a single line of code, O(n^2) 
or no.
As the nail in the coffin, callers only use ->buf, so are insulated from any 
such optimizations if we decided to do them in future.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
PS.  I don't think we should switch this to a simple char ** tho, as 
the "struct stringbuf" gives us some type safety and reminds people not to 
simply kfree it.
