>PSL?  That'll leave MODE, _TMP, _AC0, _SCP, PSV to bisect among.
for example, I would  fake these methods in this way:
	 Method (_TMP, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                    Return (0x0BB8)
            }
            Method (_PSV, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                Return (0)
            }
Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._TMP] (Node c157bf88)
Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._PSV] (Node c157be48)
Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._TC1] (Node c157bdc8)
Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._TC2] (Node c157bd88)
Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._TSP] (Node c157bd48)
Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._AC0] (Node c157bf48)
Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._SCP] (Node c157bec8)
Execute Method: [\_TZ_.THM0._TMP] (Node c157bf88)
