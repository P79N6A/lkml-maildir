GCC 3.0 Produces slower code, eh?  I was of the understanding that it 
contained many more optimizations than previous versions...???
Any way, I've been able to run my system based entirely on a fairly 
recent GCC CVS-3.02 snapshot, including kernels, and everything EXCEPT 
for glibc which is specifically incompatible according to the GNU folks.  
By way of information however, neither of the GCC 3.0 releases (3.0.0 or 
3.0.1) work at all on my system, and I cannot get a kernel to function 
at better than -O2 (not that I could get that to work in 2.95.* or 
2.96.* either).
