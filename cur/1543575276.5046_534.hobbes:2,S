you know, this might be entirely unrelated, but i had the exact same type of
problem with a brand new machine running a not-so-brand new EE100 nic.   i
couldn't figure out what was wrong, since it was a literal replacement with an
earlier machine with the same general setup (except it was a pentium-90, this
was a celeron-500-something) ... and in the p-90, that network card never gave
a hiccup.
the only way i could get it to stop was to change the network infrastructure.
this card was connected to a cisco catalyst 1000 24-port 10T switch and 2-port
100T switch.  i stuck a generic repeater off one of the 100T ports, jacked the
ee100 into the repeater, and the problem *went away*.
i thought it was just an anomaly.
if it will help, i can get the info from that machine and post it to this
thread.
cheers,
josh fryman
