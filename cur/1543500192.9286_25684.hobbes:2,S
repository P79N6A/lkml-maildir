I count at least half a dozen:
Stable (2.2)
Beta   (2.3)
Alpha  (testing)
Plus several other minor strands (Alan Cox', Andrea Arcangeli's, the SPARC
stuff on CVS). And the patches floating around the 'net.
To try to shoehorn the source into N development strands won't work, it is
contrary to the bazaar style, and (much worse!) means a lot of work
sychronizing. Please, the man-hours of Our Fearless Leader and his minions
are _way_ too precious to be wasted on such nonsense.
Unless you consider N is something like a couple thousand, one for each
active developer ;-)
