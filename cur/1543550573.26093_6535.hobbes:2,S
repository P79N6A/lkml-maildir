I had an interesting one yesterday (when I was running test9-pre7 with the
reiserfs and Riel VM patches)---I came back to my machine which was running
X to find that it had apparently locked (display had frozen, mouse and
keyboard had no effect). I then tried the normal last-ditch Alt-SysRq-s to
get it to sync, and it burst back to life as if nothing had happened...
No messages in the syslog (other than the emergency sync, of course).
On the plus side, test9-pre9 + reiserfs seems to be working nicely. Good
job, guys.
