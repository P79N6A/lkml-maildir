That's actually a fairly straightforward problem to solve.  Really we  
ought to be able to guarantee that lines from different CPUs are not  
intermixed.  This can end up in a log like this:
info: Current device state: <1>netdev watchdog timeout: eth0
reg1=0xABCD reg2=0xDEADBEEF
Clearly unpleasant, no?  Really any logging which wants to print out  
a bunch of stuff with multiple printk()s should use an API something  
like this:
Option 1: Buffer allocated with kmalloc().  Sleep-ish context, can  
handle failures easily

Option 3: Preallocated per-cpu interrupts-only buffer.  Only from  
code which may interrupt a preempt_disable() section

For all of the above, the final "qprintk_finish()" call would  
essentially take the printk spinlock and write the contents of the  
qpk->buffer into the dmesg ringbuffer, inserting ("<%d>", level) at  
the beginning and after each newline.  The buffers would all be some  
useful fixed size (a page?); if you need more than that then you are  
probably trying to queue too much and excess data would be truncated.
Since the level would be a constant passed to qprintk_ 
{kmalloc,percpu,irq} in almost every case, you could easily do  
something like this:
static inline int qprintk_kmalloc(struct printk_queue *qpk,
		unsigned int level, gfp_t gfp)
{
	if (level > CONFIG_MAX_LOG_LEVEL) {
		qpk->type = QPRINTK_TYPE_NONE; /* also 0 */
		qpk->buffer = NULL;
		return 0;
	}
	_qprintk_kmalloc(qpk, level, gfp);
}
#define qprintk(QPK, FMT...) do { \
		if ((QPK)->type)
			_qprintk(QPK, FMT);
	} while(0)
With a bit more glue that would cause GCC to notice that for a given  
qprintk_kmalloc the "qpk->type" is always zero because the level is  
too high, and therefore it would optimize out *ALL* of the  
_qprintk_kmalloc(), _qprintk(), and _qprintk_finish() calls.
