The mouse and keyboard are wonderful candidates for this... there's always 
a human connected.  It's too bad there's no way to tell if a human is 
staring at the display.  If I'm mesmerized by xmms gl eye-candy, it's a 
highly interactive cpu hog.

Sounds good.  What I'm trying within the current framework is to let tasks 
which are extremely light weight (and not kernel threads) do 
backboost.  Dunno if anything good will come out of it.

IMHO, the more people who ruminate/ramble on this very hard subject the better.
