I hesitate to declare victory just yet, but I think my problem is solved
(over a half hour of testing and no lockup). In reading the pdf docs on
the motherboard, by chance I found the word "concurrency" here:
    Passive Release (Enabled)
    This is a mechanism that allows concurrency of ISA/EISA
    cycles and CPU-to-PCI cycles. When this feature is enabled,
    the TXC will be possible to re-arbitrate the PCI bus and
    allow the CPU to access PCI even when the PCEB has been
    granted the bus.
My soundcard is an ISA device. I disabled this setting in the bios. Here
is a diff on the lspci output before & after the bios reset. Note this
is the ISA bridge that had a bit tweaked, not the host bridge.

So if anyone else asks, you know which bits to flip ;)
I'll post later if this *doesn't* solve my problem (it's 1:30 AM now
ugh) otherwise consider me a happy camper. And regardless, thanks much
to Alan and Frank for their help. Talk about customer support!
