Really?  I'd have thought that get/put_unaligned would be a simple
load/store for architectures which wish to implement it in that manner.
Other architectures could take it as an optimisation hint, to avoid taking
a trap.  They'd probably still need to implement the fixup, but if a few of
these hints could reduce the trap frequency significantly then it may be
worth doing?
I guess it depends on how many of these hints would be needed at the source
level to avoid "most" of the traps.
