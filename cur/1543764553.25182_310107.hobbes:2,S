But they're slower because there're some instances checking them.

This doesn't mean it's better just because you had the time develope it 
;). But anyhow the folk needs something, they can test to see if it's

We will see which solutions wins the "race". But I think you're 
solutions will "win", because you're Linus Torvalds -- the "Boss" of 
Linux and have to work with this system very day (usualy people are 
using what they have developed :)) -- and I have not the time develop a 
database based solution (maybe someone else is interested in developing it).
