Voyager has no APIC local timer equivalent, so I rebroadcast the timer
tick to all CPUs.  However, the local tick is done in this thread with
the xtime_lock held as write and it can trigger the scheduler load
balancing, which needs to call sched_clock()....boom.
All in all, this does show that the xtime sequence lock is a bit too
fragile.  It also seems to show that we should redo the subarch timer
hooks if we want to make the sequence locks work.
I think there should be two hooks: one called holding the xtime write
lock for doing clock adjustment specific things and the other called
after we've released the xtime write lock.
