Probably a matter of the correct spec file.  In auctex.spec, we have
Summary: 	Enhanced TeX modes for Emacsen
Name: 		auctex
Version: 	11.84
Release: 	1%{distri}
License: 	GPL
Group: 		%{commongroup}
URL: 		
http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/
Source0:        
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/auctex/
%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz
BuildArchitectures: noarch

AUCTeX is [...]
%package emacs
Summary: 	Enhanced TeX modes for GNU Emacs
Group:          %{commongroup}
Requires: 	emacs >= 21
Obsoletes:      ge_auc emacs-auctex auctex preview-latex-emacs
Conflicts:      emacspeak < 18
Provides:       auctex
So auctex-emacs obsoletes the previous "auctex" package and some other
packages.  It also provides "auctex" since some other packages might
require it.
Basically, you need to provide everything that a third-party package
might have asked for, and you need to obsolete everything that you
intend to replace.
