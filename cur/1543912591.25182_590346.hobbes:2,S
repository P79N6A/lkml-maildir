Subject: [PATCH 0/2] IB/ehca: Fixes for rc5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/31/140

These two patches fix some ehca issues that should be fixed in 2.6.23.
[1/2] fixes regressions caused by the recent addition of Small QPs.
[2/2] adds missing SRQ-related functionality that would have broken IPoIB CM.
The patches should apply cleanly, in order, against Roland's git. Please
review the changes and apply the patches for 2.6.23-rc5 if they are okay.
Regards,
  Joachim
