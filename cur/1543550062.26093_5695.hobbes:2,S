Subject: [PATCH] link-order of drivers outside drivers/scsi (i2o)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Alan and others,
The following patch changes the link order of i2o to link:
scsi core - hosts - i2o - upper layers.
The patch moves things around a bit, like all upper layer drivers
going into scsi/upper. Other drivers outside drivers/scsi can 
be changed to link in after the other hosts by just moving them
in the top Makefile.
Note that for this to work properly, i2o (and the others) needs to 
be converted to initialization by initcalls. This is trivial? or do the module
case differ from builtin?
This patch is pretty big(625Kbytes), so grab it from:
http://tlan.kernel.dk/div/scsi_upper4.diff
It includes a lot of work from Michael Chastain.
A typical patched kernel compile with everyting built into the kernel looks 
like this:
drivers/ide/idedriver.o drivers/scsi/scsidrv.o drivers/i2o/i2o.o 
drivers/scsi/upper/scsi_upper.o drivers/...
The scsi_upper.o object includes st, sr, sg, sd.
Have a nice day.
