Sorry ... this is really just a discussion of how something (zero copy)
could be done, rather than an implementation proposal.  (I'm not
actually planning to make the STGT people do anything ... although
investigating splice does sound interesting).
Right at the moment, STGT seems to be performing just fine on
measurements up to gigabit networks.  There are suggestions that there
may be a problem on 8G IB networks, but it's not definitive yet.
I'm already on record as saying I think the best fix for IB networks is
just to reduce the context switches by increasing the transfer size, but
the infrastructure to allow that only just went into git head.
