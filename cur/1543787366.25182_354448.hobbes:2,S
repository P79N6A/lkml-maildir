Ok, I think your patch is correct (we really do try to keep an order to 
those task flags), but the _real_ issue is that the comparisons are bogus.
Using ">" for task states is wrong. It's a bitmask, and if you want to 
check multiple states, then we should just do so with
	if (t->state & (TASK_xxx | TASK_yyy | ...))
Oh, well. The inequality comparisons are shorter, and historical, so I 
guess it's debatable whether we should remove them all.
