So bits <= 27 should be safe or are guaranteed safe? :> (Keep in mind

AFAICS, PG_checked is cleared in page_alloc.c and only otherwise used in
fs/ext2/dir.c, freexfs/xvfs_subr.c(commented out actually) and
afs/dir.c.
For PG_slab, should I understand 'fairly optional' to mean 'possibly
dangerous' (ie don't use)?

I can still happily do a few dynamically allocated bitmaps if there are
better things the bits can be used for. (The flags are not costly redo
and need to be redone each suspend & resume anyway).
Of course, on top of all of these questions, Pavel might not like my
code anyway so this might be a moot point :>
Anyway, for the moment, I'll proceed on the assumption that there'll be
enough flags, and I can always switch if needs be.

Nigel
