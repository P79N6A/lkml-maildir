(For all files)
Some suggestions:
 *  change the typedefs to struct, this includes:
        adapter_t -> struct adapter
 *  function prototypes and function headers (e.g. t3_get_cong_cntl_tab)
    are listed as
        void t3_get_cong_cntl_tab(adapter_t *adap,
                         unsigned short incr[NMTUS][NCCTRL_WIN]);
    which could be shortened to
        void t3_get_cong_cntl_tab(adapter_t *adap,
                         unsigned short incr[][]);
    functions where there is only one level of [], e.g.
        void t3_load_mtus(adapter_t *adap, unsigned short mtus[NMTUS],
                  unsigned short alpha[NCCTRL_WIN],
                  unsigned short beta[NCCTRL_WIN], unsigned short mtu_cap);
    could become
        void t3_load_mtus(adapter_t *adap, unsigned short *mtus,
                  unsigned short *alpha,
                  unsigned short *beta, unsigned short mtu_cap);
    depending on your taste.
 *  get rid of superfluous from-void/to-void casts, such as:
        cxgb3_main.c:754:  struct adapter *adapter =
                           (struct adapter *)dev->priv;
    in some places, the 'U' suffix for literal numbers is not required,
    such as:
        cxgb3_main.c:292:   unsigned int nq1 = max((unsigned
                            int)adap->port[1].nqsets, 1U);
        sge.c:2359:  qs->rspq.holdoff_tmr = max(p->coalesce_usecs * 10, 1U);
 *  const run 1: const'ify structs that do not change or
    are not changed, such as
        cxgb3_main.c:924:static char stats_strings[][ETH_GSTRING_LEN] = {
        t3_hw.c:220:static struct mdio_ops mi1_mdio_ops = {
        t3_hw.c:271:static struct mdio_ops mi1_mdio_ext_ops = {
        t3_hw.c:1130:   static struct intr_info pcix1_intr_info[] = {
        t3_hw.c:1166:   static struct intr_info pcie_intr_info[] = {
    (these are just the small picture)
 *  const run 2: const'ify locals that do not change, such as
        cxgb3_offload.c:63:     struct adapter *adapter = tdev2adap(tdev);
 *  const run 3: const'ify function arguments that do not change, e.g.
       static inline int offload_activated(struct t3cdev *tdev)
Note that the listed lines do not cover all source lines - cxgb3
is quite some code.
Running it through sparse gives 'context imbalance' (whatever that is - i just
tried sparse).
