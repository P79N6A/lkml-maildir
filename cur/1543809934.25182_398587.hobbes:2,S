For whatever its worth, every burner i've ever tried on a Fedora box has
just worked.   But you misunderstand, people aren't saying udev is the 
only answer; they're just saying device nodes must exist.  It's up to each
distro to decide how that happens; and then for user space to decide how 
those device nodes are passed to each application.

As has been shown, everything needed for device enumeration is already 
available to user space.  Completing the job of making device enumeration 
easy for applications remains for user space services such as HAL et. al.
not the kernel.

Yes, and if any device isn't found and created properly it's a bug that
should be fixed, not something which can be used to support Joerg's archaic
ideas.
