There's nothing really fixable here.

Yeah.  I did get rid of the fd_set in sigio_handler, saving another 128 bytes.
Basically, UML is being screwed by the signal frame size.

Probably :-)
I don't really want to fiddle with that, because that will impose constraints 
that will hurt responsiveness.

*ding ding ding*  We have a winner.
I'm going to allocate 4 pages instead of two, and either have three of them 
available for the stack or have two available for the stack and the third 
unmapped to protect the task structure.
