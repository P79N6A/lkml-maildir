i didnt. Read what i wrote:
|| no, you are wrong, read the current Kconfig rules again. If the user 
|| can create a .config that does not build, it is driver breakage. It 
|| always was, and has been in the past 15 years.
||
|| Kconfig might be extended to make dependencies easier to manage for 
|| developers but until that is implemented you have to craft your 
|| driver's dependencies with the current tools in a way that doesnt 
|| break the build.
and that's exactly what happens with Roman's patch: a Kconfig subsystem 
design bug (its inability to properly propagate the dependencies of 
select's) is worked around in the driver space: by the LEDS_CORE driver 
config introduction and no user-visible.
Roman's patch is obviously cleaner than my hack (i just fixed a single 
instantiation of the problem, while he changed the LEDS driver 
dependency structure), but it's still a workaround for a Kconfig 
subsystem bug and the same problem could reoccur elsewhere. It could hit 
anytime dual dependencies are introduced in a driver accidentally.
As Sam said it, fixing that Kconfig design bug would be "nice" - but 
unfortunately the Kconfig subsystem is not actively developed anymore. 
Would you like to volunteer for that? It would be a _very_ useful 
contribution. One such fix could avoid hundreds or even thousands of 
trivial problems in the future - it could avoid having to make hundreds 
or thousands of trivial patches in the future.
