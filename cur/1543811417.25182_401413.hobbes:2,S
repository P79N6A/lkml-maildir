Subject: [PATCH 000 of 2] Introduction - make some address_space_operations return void

[Resending - with linux-fsdevel spelt correctly thing time - sorry]
While reading through the address_space_operations code, I discoverred
that two methods return 'int' values that are never used: invalidatepage and
sync_page.
Accordingly, the following two patches convert them to return 'void'.
Any comments?
