Indeed he was.  I responded to Alan, though, who was talking of
signals and a classic method of handling them:

I, and I believe Alan, were talking about systems _without_ threads...
I.e. a time-honoured technique for turning signals into events in a
portable program.  Of course modern platforms with good threading
don't need to use the technique.

All the ones you gave require threads, hence I would not consider any
of them portable.  I'll be impressed if you come up with something
that doesn't use threads, pipes or more signals.

That's all very well if you're on a system which _has_ SA_RESTART.
Here are some portability notes:
	- Traditional BSD-like systems don't have SA_RESTART.
	  They always restart some system calls on signals.
	- POSIX specifies that signals always interrupt system
	  calls (according to the GNU libc documentation).
	  You cannot make signals restartable.
	- On some threading systems, establishing a signal handler
	  with SA_RESTART not set will cause it to interrupt systems
	  calls in all thread, not just the one it is destined for.
	  If you used this technique, you'd need to take it into
	  account in the code of all threads.
	- Of course, truly portable code has to assume EINTR may be
	  returned by all interruptible system calls anyway.
	- The select() system call is interrupted by signals
	  even when they have SA_RESTART set anyway.  If that's all
	  you want to interrupt, you don't need to mess with the flag.

It's called sigatomic_t.

What was that about not mixing signals and threads?
Even when you have a thread library, and it claims to be pthreads, I'd
consider pthread_kill() the most unlikely construct to work portably,
without crashing poll/select, or failing to terminate it, that we've
come up with so far.
Having seen siglongjmp() crash when it's done during select(), I have
not a lot of faith in things working the unix way on all the platforms
I target, let alone pthreads and signals working as specified.

Certainly, optimising for the common case is good and so is saving
system calls.  (Believe me, I am very familiar with saving system calls).
I hope this exchange has been entertaining.  As you can see, we have
very different target platforms in mind when we talk of portability.
