In short it is always set when we have a strong cue that the sender is in
slow start. The problem is that Linux doesn't send acks quickly enough to
get the sender quickly out of slow start when it sends lots of small packets. 
Quickack does in principle the right thing, but it works for too few acks (1).
My proposal is to extend the quickack state to more acks, so that it speeds
up the many small packets too (instead of only the single small packet HTTP 
case). Only thing it has to make sure is that the estimate about the
sender's slow start makes sense - extended quickack shouldn't trigger for
a fast retransmit.
