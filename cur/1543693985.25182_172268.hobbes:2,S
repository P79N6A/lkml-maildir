Instead of zeroing the entire partition just zero that single sector.
something like:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 seek=$lbasector conv=notrunc count=1
possibly first check (by reading in the oposite direction:
dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null bs=512 skip=$lbasector count=1)
if this is indeed the place were you get the read error (in syslog)...
if you can read anything from it then read it to a file and write it back 
from the file...
as for checking which file contains it... hmm file->sector->lba mapping 
can be performed... I don't know about the other direction.  Worst case 
would require checking the mapping of all files on the partition (and 
assuming it's not in an empty area or non-file system area).
Cheers,
MaZe.
