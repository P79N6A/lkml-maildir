For now I think moving your code to ata_dev_config() function is 
sufficient, with one modification:
Move the
	((ap->cbl == ATA_CBL_SATA) && (!ata_id_is_sata(ap->device)))
test into a separate function all its own, "ata_knobble_device" or 
somesuch.  static inline if you wish.
Then it will be trivial to add a 'knobble' module parm later on, by 
simply modifying ata_knobble_device() to also check the module parameter 
in addition to the existing tests.
