Ok, I see.

The problem is that we can have several PPS sources into a system and
all these sources will arise their IRQ line (quasi)simultaneously and
I don't wish a CPU may delay one of these IRQ handler due a spinlock
into the pps_event().
That's why I'm trying to avoid any lock into pps_event().

Ok. I'll add your comment too.

This can be done only with locks, but it's not necessary since even if
a pps_unregister_source() runs while pps_event() executes on another
CPU the latter will write always on a valid area (even if it could be
a dummy one) and the data are not corrupted (note also that the data
will be, in any case, discarted since we are executing a
pps_unregister_source()).

No. These options can be enabled but if no serial/parallel driver is
loaded no PPS source is registered.
Thanks,
