There is no interface option under Adapter.  These options are available:
     Reset to Default Settings
     PowerFail Safeguard = ENABLED/DISABLED
     Disk Spin up Timings
     Cache Flush Timings
     View/Update Rebuild Rate
     Diagnostics
     Adapter Type = ... (fixed)
     Auto Rebuild = ENABLED/DISABLED
I went ahead and commented out the I2O check, and my dev. machine booted
successfully.  As always, the megaraid message was a little weird:
