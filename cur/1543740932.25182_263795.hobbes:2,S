It does not seem like they do, but they cannot be good...
I have applied the following patches
1] TSO patch
2] rollup.patch
Rebooting now and will alert the list if/when I receive more page 
allocation failures.
FYI - I started getting these with 2.6.9.
(However, it was always possible on the Dell Optiplex GX1 to create page 
allocation failure with: ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000), however, on a higher-end 
machine (2.6GHZ, 2GB ram, etc) ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000 worked fine.
Is it something with the architecture of the box bus/box?
Why does it tend to affect one machine and not the other?
