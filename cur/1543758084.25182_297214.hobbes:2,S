But if we were to enforce that policy, realtime policy would become less
useful.  You havn't even acknowledged that such a tradeoff exists, let
alone demonstrated that we're on the wrong side of it.
Here's a quicky which will convert all your kernel threads to SCHED_RR,
priority 99.  Please test.
#!/bin/sh
PIDS=$(ps axo pid,command | grep ' \[.*\]$' | sed -e 's/ \[.*\]$//')
for i in $PIDS
do
	chrt -r 99 -9 $i
done
