Hello,
I'd like to have a LILO version that supports higher serial speeds than
9600bps. Questions:
- Is there a version that already does that?
- If not, do I need to change just LILO to do that, or do I need to change
  the kernel as well (I don't think I'd need to do that too, as the serial 
  console kernel code does support up to 115.2Kbps, but it doesn't hurt to 
  ask ... ;) ??
- Does another bootloader (e.g. GRUB) support serial speeds higher than
  9600bps?? If so, which one(s)??
TIA for your help!!
Later,
Ivan
