On the winchip, it was a huge win. I can't remember exact numbers,
but pretty much every benchmark I threw at it at the time showed
significant improvement.

It's CONFIG_SMP anyway, which none of the winchips were.
SMP+OOSTORE just didn't happen, and I'd be surprised if
any vendor makes it happen any time soon.
(Even if so, it's likely we'd need to make additional changes
 anyway, so adding it back shouldn't be a big deal.)
