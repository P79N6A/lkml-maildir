Since someone was reporting that it doesn't work, and there was some
question if the Domex ("the domex", is there only one? :) is an NCR5380,
I'll add one positive report. But maybe I confused it with some other
card/chip you are discussing?
I have 9820 and not 9819, but other than that identical. There is also a
marking "DMX3181LE" on the bottom right. (fwiw, someone in some newsgroup
said that IS11 is the name of the card ...)
From my /etc/conf.modules:
alias scsi_hostadapter g_NCR5380
options g_NCR5380 dtc_3181e=1 ncr_addr=0x280
alias sga sg
This has run successfully under 2.2, not tested with 2.0 or 2.3.
