It's not a new bug - it's an old bug that apparently is uncovered by a
new stricter test.
Apparently loopback unlocks an already unlocked page - which has always
been a serious offense, but has never been detected before.
test12-pre6+ detects it, and thus the BUG().
Your stack trace isn't symbolic (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt), so
it's impossible to debug, but it's already interesting information to
see that it seems to be either loopback of vfat.
Can you test some more? In particular, I'd love to hear if this happens
with vfat even without loopback, or with loopback even without vfat
(make an ext2 filesystem or similar instead). That woul dnarrow down the
bug further.
