Hello guys!
This periodicly appears in my system. The Kernel seems to misdetect the
right cpu speed and then it's running only at 165mhz.
I don't really understand why this happens, there's no acpi enabled, which
caused this failure the last time.
I attached .config of 2.5.24 [which still runs fine with devfs :) ]
and /proc/cpuinfo.
Please cc me when answering.
Nico
