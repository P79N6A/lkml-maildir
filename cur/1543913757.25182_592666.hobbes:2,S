Excellent. This is so easy to overlook.

Hm. This sounds like two different things:
- Eliminate the need to check after each operation. Might be a matter
of taste; personally, I prefer checking and unwinding on error.
- Atomic creation/deletion of a bunch of sysfs nodes. This sounds
like something really worthwile to have.

Really nice. The need to delete/create symlinks on moving/renaming is
currently a headache inducer.

Makes sense.

Yes, if we can change internal implementation details without upsetting
userspace a lot is gained. As long as the default behaviour remains
easy to implement.
