No, if you do create a constant for a PCI ID, it still should go into 
include/linux/pci_ids.h.
Putting them in the driver will result in highly variable naming 
policies, which in turn means the constants are less grep-able than today.
Device IDs simply do not need an associated constant, if they are used 
only in a PCI ID table.  Device IDs are arbitrary numbers that are 
normally only used once in a source file.
Vendor IDs are used repeatedly, and definitely belong in pci_ids.h. 
Device IDs make sense in pci_ids.h if they are used more than once.
