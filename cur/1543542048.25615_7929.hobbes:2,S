Cool, sounds a bit like what SubDomain does

Post the patch to the list, or a pointer to the patch if the patch is
relatively large. After getting some feedback, try submitting it to
whomever is the maintainer in the section(s) that you have modified, and
see what they say.
Looking forward to seeing your changes,
