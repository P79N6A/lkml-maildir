Er, what?  What do you mean by "load random binary crap"?  Are you 
worried that a malicious kernel module might modify paravirt_ops?  How 
is that different from a malicious module doing any of the infinite 
other things a malicious module can do?  A module will only register a 
taint if its playing by the rules anyway, and a module playing by the 
rules won't touch paravirt_ops directly.
