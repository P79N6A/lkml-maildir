what you are missing is that apps that need to do lots of syncing (databases, 
mail servers) need to wait for the data to hit non-volitile media before the 
write is complete. this limits such apps to ~1 write per revolution of the 
platters (yes it's possible for a limited time to have multiple writes to 
different things happen to be on the same track, but the counter is the extra 
seek time needed between tracks)
so any benchmark that shows more transactions then the media has revolutions is 
highly suspect (now if you have battery-backed cache, or the equivalent you can 
blow past these limits)
on consumer (7200 rpm) drives this limit is 120/sec, on high-end drives (15Krpm 
scsi's this is 250/sec, and on the 10k rpm drives in the middle it's about 
166/sec.
