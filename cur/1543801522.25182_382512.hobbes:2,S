Well..., not if NR_CPUS is big too. (We just saw a thread on lkml about 
raising NR_CPUS to 1024 on ia64).
On a 1024 CPUS machine, a kmem cache could use at least 1 MB for its internal 
structures, plus 1024 pages (PAGE_SIZE) for holding the caches (one cache per 
CPU), if you assume at least one task was created on behalf each cpu.
if PAGE_SIZE is 64KB, you end up with 65 MB of ram for the cache. Even with 
100.000 tasks running on the machine, its not a win.
slab caches are very complex machinery that consume O(NR_CPUS) ram.
