Subject: 2.2.16 - unix sockets cause process hangs

I'm running a fairly large system here, and I've noticed that when the
system becomes fairly loaded (about 200-300 processes and ~100 tcp/ip
connections) that anything that uses unix sockets just hangs.. including
syslogd and named.
Is this a known problem? is there a kernel that I can go back to or a
patch for 2.2.16 that fixes it? 
Thanks for any help.
