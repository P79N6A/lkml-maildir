Well, the state of the "central tree" is represented by a cset key at
each point.  So the answer to your question is a list of keys.  But the
keys in question aren't "special" in any bk sense; they're just some
keys.  You can keep track of keys outside of BK if you want, to keep a
history of "state of this tree at time X", but BK can't keep track of
that info.
Anyways, maybe an example is in order.

Those are the changesets that are present in 2.5.4 that aren't present
in 2.5.4-pre6 (note how I used tag..tag in the -r option.)  Similarly,
you can do
-r'rml@tech9.net|ChangeSet|20020210205932|34726..davej@suse.de|ChangeSet|20020211004458|26395'
(that is, "key1..key2") to find the keys implied by key2 and not implied
by key1.  (Read "bk help set" for even more sophisticated options.)
Pick the interesting csets and do a binary search...  (Or better, write
a script to do it!)
