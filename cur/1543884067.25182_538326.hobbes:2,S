Hi, please: Could you explain to me why you are turning around the logical principle all the time?
Those patches (and my humble ones too of course that gained no attention for months) were made for the POSITIVE CASE
in which it is ENSURED that a DST card DOES NOT EXIST in the machine, NOT VICE VERSA!
So please in how far isn't that fantastic work done by Trent enough?
So it is very clear that if there are oopses and hangups if such a card exists and its drivers are deselected.
No point at all!
So please explain me the essence why you use the inversion of the given logic to NOT ACK or SIGN this beautiful work.
I want to see THREE valid arguments for this turnaround illogical behaviour please.
Uwe
P. S.: I tested Trent's work and I can ensure that there aren't any Oopses at all!
So your case studies are not only highly invented and strange, but they aren't any help either. I really wonder what the hell is going on in your brain.
I really ask myself why you are doing this nerve war, this ping-pong game all the time.
This work is done for the case where there aren't any DST cards inside the machine,
so you cannot just come up, turn everything around, and thus pick up the inversion that fits into your strange concept (whatever that may be - noone except you
knows) for blocking that good work.
So I'd deeply appreciate you to stop this strange hindrance policy. You will do nobody any favour with that strange behaviour!
In my eyes you do not want to help at all - you just want to provoke. And if in the end someone insults you you seem to have won.
But you do not win anything with your strange gestures behind other peoples backs, you're instead counterproductive.
And EVEN IF you write this publically you should immediately stop to do this behind the author's back - so I CCed Trent Piepho.
Just to see and show him the bad methods that you are using to qualify other people's efforts.
