Maybe you should consider that if there's only one parameter,
it implies both on- and off- times, leading to a duty cycle
of 50% ?
It would also make it easier to get and set the frequency
when the duty cycle is assumed to be 50%.
Also, I'm not sure that a resolution of 1ms really is
appropriate, in case you encounter hardware with better
resolution. With ms, at high blink rates (>=100 Hz),
you're bound to 500,333,250,200,166,142,125,111,100 Hz,
which does not give you much control over the duty cycle
for devices with a high frequency.
Maybe you should express the on- and off- times in microseconds ?
Just my two cents anyway since I'm not directly concerned
by such devices.

Willy
