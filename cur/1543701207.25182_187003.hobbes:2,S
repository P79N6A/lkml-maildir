But then anything that does the loads in ascending order is still ok, so
it shouldn't matter - by the time "dest" has been overwritten, the source
data has already been read. And all the "memcpy()"  implementations had
better do that anyway, in order to get nice memory access patterns. "rep
movsl" certainly does.
So assuming we have an ascending "memcpy()", the only case we need to care 
about is "overlap && dest > src".
Now, if we have a non-ascending memcpy(), we have trouble.
