Can you sketch what you have in mind.
We right now have said we wnated to:
1) include a framework for executing simple new-syscall-test-stubs
2) have a nice place for kernel example code
I could come up with something but I expect you already have something
in your mind where to put stuff.
If I have a rough idea I can start looking into the kbuild bits of it.
Not that I will have it ready within the next two weeks but nice buffer
when I anyway drop sleeping..
