Hi,
I was under the impression that from kernel 2.6.10-rc1 or something, it
should be possible to burn cd's as an unpriviledged user again if you
have a 100% mmc-compatible cd-recorder.
This does not work here. Is it because my cd-recorder is SCSI? Or is it
not 100% mmc compatible, even though cdrecord says it is?
Here's the output:
stianj@chevrolet:/tmp$ cdrecord -dev=1,5,0 test.iso
cdrecord: No write mode specified.
cdrecord: Asuming -tao mode.
cdrecord: Future versions of cdrecord may have different drive dependent
defaults.
cdrecord: Continuing in 5 seconds...

Is this expected? It's kinda not nice to start Gnome as root, to be able
to use nautilus-cd-burner...
Best regards,
Stian
