While most of us were at the OLS, Philippe continued hacking on Adeos
and has extended the functionality to include SMP support. In light
of the discussions I had with many folks at the OLS (the K42 team,
Larry, Paul and others), this is a positive step forward to having
multiple Linux kernels running on the same hardware.
The code has been tested on a dual PIII. Of course, further testing
and comments are most welcome. The latest CVS snapshot is available
at:
