I know that didn't use to be true - I could start a X server from within
another X server, and the second X server would restore the _graphics_
mode of the first one.
I suspect the fb people haven't even _talked_ to the X people. It should
be trivial to add an option to XFree86 to say "oh, btw, the mode is
already set up, don't bother with modeswitching on entry or exit". 
But I suspect there is some GGI mentality somewhere - people thinking that
all graphics should be done by the fb layer and thus don't even _want_ to
consider X working. And such mentality is worse than a small bug, I'm
afraid, as it tends to mean that the thing never gets fixed. 
Oh, well.
