Sorry. Should have mentioned that one of my freezer changes includes
running sync between freezing userspace and freezing the kernel threads,
that I double check there are no dirty buffers afterwards and wait on
the completion of all suspend's I/O between after each part of the image
is written/read (have to be paranoid because of the way I reuse LRU
pages).
