OK...I read Tony's patch post to imply that he is consenting to lib/ as
the location as well.  Tony, please speak-up if that is not the case.
If everyone agrees, I'll re-collect the patches moving everything to
lib/ (plus the one I forgot to repost) and Tony's patch and repost.
So, who is the proper committer for this?  Tony?  Or should I send
them directly to Andrew?
Thanks,
John
