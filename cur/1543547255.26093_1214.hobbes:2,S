The 2.2.18pre1 changes are higher risk problems to fix. 2.2.17pre20 is extremely
solid. Its probably the most solid 2.2 kernel so far overall (Im sure it will
break for someone though). The 2.2.18pre stuff is now starting again making
higher risk changes that should be reliable but might produce suprises and
need to be fixed/reverted before 2.2.18 final
