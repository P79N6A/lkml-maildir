I thought so too, until your semi open-source link kit is linked to that
brand-new linux kernel source tree, and at the same time the binary
components of your link-kit have become incompatible with that newer kernel. 
Result? one might even loose its data, upon booting that newly build
kernel and modules, in case your storage-controller has a binary only
link-kit as its driver.
