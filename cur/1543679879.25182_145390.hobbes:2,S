Chris,
Would you please separate those tree fixes in separate diffs?
For me it seems low latency and fix-pausing patches should be enough for
"better" IO fairness. I might be wrong about that, though.
Lets try this: Include elevator-low-latency in -pre3 (which I'm trying to
release today), then fix pausing in -pre4. If the IO fairness still doesnt
get somewhat better for general use (well get isolated user reports and
benchmarks for both the two patches), then I might consider the q->full
patch (it has throughtput drawbacks and I prefer avoiding a tunable
there).
Sounds good?
