I did not say it was increased to improve interactivity response - and
it certainly has little or nothing to do with kernel preemption being
merged.
I suspect a big benefit would be poll/select performance.  I think this
is why RedHat increased HZ in their kernels.
You would have to ask Linus exactly what his intentions were.
