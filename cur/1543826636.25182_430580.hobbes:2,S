Sorry.  I got ahead of myself.  My concern is how the suspend/resume code
works with device drivers on an SMP system.  My initial impression was
that the subsystem registers with the suspend/resume layer and upon such
actions those registered functions are called.  
Inside those functions I saved the previous state of the watchdog timer.
However, I learned today that my understanding was incorrect.  Instead
first the _hotplug_ code is called for every cpu _except_ cpu0.  The
_suspend/resume_ functions are only called in the context of _cpu0_.  
This breaks the design I have because upon resuming the watchdog timers
automatically start on all cpus (except cpu0 because I saved the previous
state through the handlers), regardless of what the previous state was.  
So my question is/was what is the proper way to handle processor level
subsystems during the suspend/resume path on an SMP system.  I really
don't understand the hotplug path nor the suspend/resume path very well.  
I didn't want to register a hotplug handler because a hotplug event is
really different than a suspend event (I want to _save_ info during a
suspend event).  The documentation I was reading seemed to suggest that
hotplug/suspend/smp was a work-in-progress. 
Is the typical approach to just hack in an extra parameter to the
start/stop functions of the nmi_watchdog letting the function know it is
coming through the suspend/resume path? 
Any tips, code, other docs would be helpful.
Cheers,
Don
