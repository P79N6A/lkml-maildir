I fail to understand this. How can we say that its not a bug. If we 
support recursive tasklets, we should support killing them also. If we can 
do it why not do it. Is there any reason for that.

You r right. Its a similar problem. TASKLET_STATE_SCHED will never get 
reset for disabled tasklets.
I feel that these issues can be addresses easily by adding a couple of 
checks.
