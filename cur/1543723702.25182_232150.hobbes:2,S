thanks for your patches, but I have some trouble to apply them:
hamilton1:/usr/src/linux-2.6.7# cat ../patches/sk98/sk98_patch1.txt |patch -p1
patching file drivers/net/sk98lin/skge.c
Hunk #5 succeeded at 4906 (offset -1 lines).
patching file drivers/net/sk98lin/h/skdrv2nd.h
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n]
Either option I will give here, it will always fail to compile with those 
messages:

Is your patch for vanilla 2.6.7?
Thanks,
