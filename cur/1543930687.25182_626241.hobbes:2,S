Well that is indeed more civil language, if somewhat revisionist, since 
I distinctly remember being flamed by you from the word go.  Once 
again, thankyou for the catch.  A fairly trivial oversight that would 
have been caught sooner of later.  As for the typedef thing, that was 
just a spelling flame, admit it.
Truly, the way you were yelling I thought you had picked up a 
fundamental flaw instead of a simple misplaced line of code.
Now about that block writeout deadlock... it doesn't just affect my 
code, it basically breaks Linux as a storage platform, among other 
things.

Daniel
