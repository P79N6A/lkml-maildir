Yes, you will have to use coldsync to talk to this device right now, as
pilot-link doesn't have support for the 4.x Palm OS USB protocol yet
(jpilot uses pilot-link.)
Let me know if coldsync fails (remember you have to tell coldsync that
you are a m50x, and that you want the "simple" protocol, check the docs
for the proper config file setting.)
