dynamic filtering sucks, I agree, and I am not arguing for that.

No, I think hardcoding at compile time is useful here.
It serves to encourage openness, nobody is forced to use it, and it 
provides an additional layer of protection for those that choose to use 
it.  That is the point.  It's a choice, and you don't have to enable it 
in your kernel.  But there seems to be enough demand that it should be 
at least an option.
