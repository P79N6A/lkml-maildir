As much as I absolutely love the utility of this 
piece of code you really do have to admit that it 
_is_ rather difficult to understand :)
Is it so flawed of me to expect that some day this
code could be rewritten in an extremely clean
fashion and compilers made to do the work that
was put in to make this fast?
