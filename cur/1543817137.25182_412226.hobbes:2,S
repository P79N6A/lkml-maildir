unsigned int seems fine to me.

Not if flags == 0 maintains the same behaviour. The only flag I can
think of right now is the 'move' or 'gift' flag, meaning that the caller
wants to migrate pages from the pipe instead of copying them. I'd
imagine we'd get that in way before 2.6.17 anyways, so I think we're
fine.
