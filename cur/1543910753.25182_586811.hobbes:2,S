It does not go below UDMA33. 
dd if=/dev/zero of=some.file bs=131072 count=1024 takes 526 seconds (amazing 
transfer rate 255KB/s) with system being unresponsive most of the time.
Commenting out the UDMA support in sata_via.c (.udma_mask and .set_dmamode for 
PATA port) causes the driver to run in PIO4 mode which seems to work without 
errors but slowly (3MB/s with 100% CPU load).
