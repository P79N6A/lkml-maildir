Some minor coding style nits:
	- you are creating your own typedefs, please don't.  Use the
	  "struct foo" style instead.
	- you have a number of printk() calls without a logging level.
	  Hm, looks like some of the functions doing this aren't ever
	  called at all (avc_dump_cache() is one example)...
	- your function style should be changed to take advantage of the
	  kerneldoc functionality.  avc_lookup() is a good example of
	  something that could benifit from this (don't put comments
	  within a function declaration...)
Other than that, the coding style looks real good.
thanks,
