Well, that's a price - any event which wants to be supported needs to
store for events - kevent_storage is a list_head plus spinlock and
pointer to itself (with all current users that pointer can be removed and
access transferred to container_of()) - it is exactly as in epoll storage - 
both were created with the smallest possible overhead in mind.
