I can confirm, that works for me too.

I don't have this one. The logs say:
sony_acpi: method: name: GPID, args 0
sony_acpi: method: name: GBRT, args 0
sony_acpi: method: name: SBRT, args 1
sony_acpi: method: name: GPBR, args 0
sony_acpi: method: name: SPBR, args 1
sony_acpi: method: name: GCTR, args 0
sony_acpi: method: name: SCTR, args 1
sony_acpi: method: name: GPCR, args 0
sony_acpi: method: name: SPCR, args 1
sony_acpi: method: name: GCMI, args 1
sony_acpi: method: name: SCMI, args 1
sony_acpi: method: name: PWAK, args 0
sony_acpi: method: name: PWRN, args 0
sony_acpi: method: name: CSXB, args 1
So, let alone the ones the driver already exposes when loaded with
debug=1, I have:
GPID, GPCR/SPCR, PWAK and PWRN.
A few random comments:
* GPID could be "get product id"?
* I'll give a try to GPCR/SPCR, seems to be another get/set pair.
* Isn't is strange that GCMI takes one argument?
* CSXB is obviously not part of a standard get/set pair, which might
  (somewhat) explain why it crashed my system the other day.
I'll report if I can find more.
Thanks,
