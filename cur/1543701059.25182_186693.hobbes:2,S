The kernel holds the swapfile's i_sem while it is in use.  This is to
prevent the filesystem destruction which would result if some silly person
were to truncate a swapfile while it was in active use.
It is not a particularly important safety feature ("don't do that") and it
can be taken out if it is causing serious side-effects.
Is chmod of an in-use swapfile an important thing to be able to do?
