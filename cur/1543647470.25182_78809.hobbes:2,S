Ok, honest question for you Larry:
Assume for the moment that I'm not eligible for the free BK license (I 
don't think that's the case, but for the question...).
Assume that I plan a project that is going to start at 1 person and grow.
Assume that at some point in the future, that project will grow large 
and complex enough to need BK.
What source control should I use _now_ so that I can grow into BK over 
time?  Bonus question: Why?
(The answer may be something like  'CVS -> Subversion -> ... -> BK', but 
I don't know.)
A little bit of background:  In college I didn't know of source control. 
  CVS was a godsend for me when I found it.  But renames, copies, 
directories, dealing with multiple files in a change, those kinds of 
things "hurt" in CVS, even with just me.  I want better tools, ideally 
open-source, but I suspect that I don't know what I'm looking for.
TIA,
Eli
