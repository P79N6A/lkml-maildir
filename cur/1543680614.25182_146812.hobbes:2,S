I've been working on a patch for 2.4.18 that allows PAGE_OFFSET
to be set on boundarys other then 1GB multiples. I started with
a patch that I got from Martin Bligh and back ported it to 2.4.18.

I'll apologize in advance for not having figured out how the configure
system works, so, when you apply this patch it's on. Also, you have to
edit vmlinux.lds AND page.h to move the boundary.
Anyway, I now need to propagate this patch forward to 2.4.20 and wanted
to get it out there for other people to look at.
I will do the config thing when I do this port.
--------
On the subject of the 4G/4G patch, I started with 2.5.74, added 
patch-2.5.74-bk1 and 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/4g-patches/4g-2.5.74-F8
and I get a hunk that fails:
patching file include/asm-i386/mmu_context.h
Hunk #1 FAILED at 29.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 38 (offset -5 lines).
Hunk #4 FAILED at 75.
2 out of 4 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file include/asm-i386/mmu_context.h.rej
Is/are there a patch(es) that I'm missing?
I'm pretty new to hacking on the linux kernel.
