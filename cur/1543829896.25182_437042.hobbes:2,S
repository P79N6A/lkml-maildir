Ok. Even if we do this with a command line, we need to have a clean concept.
If the concept is ignore devices with a brittle init routine that is comprehensible
and potentially useful for other reasons than crash dumps.
If the concept is crashdump it is a poorly defined concept and all of Andrews
objections apply.

I have some code that I keep intending to get to.  It has probably bit rotted
since I wrote it, but it shouldn't be too bad to clean up.
Unfortunately the whole crashdump thing is fairly low on my priority list.
Although I suspect a relocatable kernel is actually easier than the more
important task of moving IRQ initialization into init_IRQ. on x86 and x86_64.
At least I have managed to remove 3 layers of indirection in the x86_64 irq
handling code recently :)
