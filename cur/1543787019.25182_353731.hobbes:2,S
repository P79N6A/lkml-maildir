yes I'm taking about IC. But each IC has a different start base
address with huge hole between each of them. For instance I have 2 RAM
mapped as shown below:
RAM1 -> physical address at 0x2000 0000, size = 32 Mo
RAM2 -> physical address at 0x3000 0000, size = 2 Mo

did you work on ARM discontig memory ?

yes that what I understand. CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM is used on UMA system
to avoid mem_map to blow up when using RAMs whose start base addresses
are separated with huge hole.

hmm, not sure it works the way you described. I thought there were
nodes gathering several RAM whose start address are _contiguous_. Each
node has several zones (dma, normal and highmem). But I don't see how
allocation can be done using *all* nodes...
I found in "include/linux/gfp.h", for a UMA system:
               #define alloc_pages(gfp_mask, order) \
                            alloc_pages_node(numa_node_id(), gfp_mask, order)
and numa_node_id expands to 0 for a UP system.
Any Idea ?
Thanks
