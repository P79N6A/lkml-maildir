BIOS upgrades qualify as changing hardware (or close to it)
oops-we-messed-up cases of kernel changes don't justify 'best effort' 
nameing, it's a regression that needs to be fixed.
now the other example given of docking a laptop is closer to reasonable 
(and is definantly a reason to have 'best effort' nameing as an option), 
but that's still a relativly special case, and it _is_ definantly 
changeing the hardware
