Interesting patch, I know some folks have been asking about HZ=10k
recently, so this could help. 
The only bit that worries me a bit is the change from HZ->USER_HZ for
internal calculations. In my mind, USER_HZ should only be used for
converting internal system ticks to userspace-visible ticks. Changing
drivers to think about things in user-ticks confuses things a bit since
suddenly some kernel code is thinking in user-ticks and others in
system-ticks. It just muddles things a bit.
