Hi Benjamin,
I tried your patch because on recent -mm kernels I see dirty colored 
columns during a few seconds when switching from X to radeon fbcon
(looks like remaining colors of X).
I don't know what visible effect your patch is supposed to have.
I didn't see any difference, but I doesn't seem to break anything.
Regards,
Brice
