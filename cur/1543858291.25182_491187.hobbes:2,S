Now that syscall macros have been pulled from the -mm tree, what method
is recommended to use syscalls?
(I've wasted a day grubbing through sources before giving up and copying
the old syscall macros into one key driver)
_syscall macros are used by:
ATI driver  (no choice.  I'm working with laptops)
vmware  (I'm trying to phase this out for qemu, but it's a slow process)
(and others I suspect)
I realize that these are "closed source" but my work is rather dependant
on them remaining operational - and as the 2.6.19 kernel series is the
only one that works on most of the hardware provided by my workplace,
I'm kind of stuck patching things myself.
There doesn't seem to be any documentation on this so I ask about how to
replace the _syscallX calls.
Thank you!
