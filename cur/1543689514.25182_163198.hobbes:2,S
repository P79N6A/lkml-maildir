What are you talking about?  The condition for clearing VM_NONLINEAR
is an explicit check to see if the range to be populated covers the
whole vma.

If that condition isn't enough, then async futexes are in trouble,
because the curval check equivalent is done in userspace for async
futexes...

I mean it prevents the futex key corresponding to the userspace word
from changing before we read the word.  For all reasonable uses this
doesn't matter anyway.
