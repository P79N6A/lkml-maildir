I have tried that, and yet it still has static and crackles.
Here is a picture of my aumix:

Also, secondary speakers did not work, however I've read that you need a
utility to set this up with the new driver.
The sound is OK except for the crackles, is there anyway to take the
driver
from 2.4.7 use it with 2.4.10?
On a side note, the usb-uhci-2.4.10.patch worked great with my usb
webcam, without the patch it
would freeze the machine.
