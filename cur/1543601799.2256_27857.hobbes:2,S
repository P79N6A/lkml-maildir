Never had a slower Athlon than 1.4, but I suppose the system could be
underclocked as well;-) However, I have to think there's other stuff
happen, see below.

In my case, if I compile a 686 kernel it is nice and stable, while an
Athlon kernel is not. With all due respect I bet the temperature is dead
the same regardless of kernel, so I can't blame temperature.
The problem I have is seen only when I use Athlon code enabled with
menuconfig, so the question is if the code is bad (as in timing
sensitive), or if the compiler might be generating bad code for Athlon.
Just a data point, I believe that the problems (at least those which are
bugging me) are releated to something other than temperature.
