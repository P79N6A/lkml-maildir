The lower-zone protection code will only preserve an extra megabyte or so
of the normal zone in response to __GFP_HIGHMEM allocations, so it won't be
coming into play here.
I'd prefer to replace the lower-zone/incremental-min code with 2.4's
watermark code.  It's pretty much equivalent, but makes the calculations
once-only and it is easier to observe and understand its effects.  But
there's too much work going on in there to make this change at present.

Yup.  With the current -mm patches the reclaim rate from lowmem and highmem
is nicely proportional to each zone's size for pagecache-heavy workloads. 
For lowmem-intensive workloads the reclaim rate from lowmem is higher, as
one would expect.  It seems to be working OK now.
