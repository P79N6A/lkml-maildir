I don't know setcd, but issuing a CDROM_LOCKDOOR ioctl with arg 1
will lock the door. Unmounting is a different issue, because currently
you can't do that if the drive is opened more than once (which it will
be, mount + locking program). I guess we could work around this by allowing
root to unlock a busy drive, or some other hack like that.

This just controls whether tray is locked when it is opened, so it has
no effect after the mount.
