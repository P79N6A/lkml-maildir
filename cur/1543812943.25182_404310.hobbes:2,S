Maybe this is a stupid/OT question (answer off list if you think so) but
why not?  Isn't that the standard way of telling the scheduler that you
have a realtime constraint?  It's how pro audio stuff works which I
would think has similar RT requirements.
How is the scheduler supposed to know to penalize a kernel compile
taking 100% CPU but not a game using 100% CPU?
