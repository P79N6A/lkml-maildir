Here I am totally agree. I would like to not have to mess with
separate firmware files. I even don't want binary firmware, gimme
the source!
Sadly, realities are such that we have to live somehow
with closed-source firmware. Worse, sometimes it even isn't freely
redistributable (vendor did not explicitly allowed that),
and thus we have to ship driver, but users must obtain
firmware elsewhere themself.
Thus so far we cannot avoid having split drivers.
