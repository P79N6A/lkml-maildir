Hi guys,
can anyone explain to me why having a semaphore with N process 
waiting for, up() release all N tasks of which only one get the free way ?
This cause N call to wakeup() and N-1 call to schedule().
Why don't implement a FIFO queue inside the semaphore and release 
only one of waiting processes when up() is called ?
When We have few tasks waiting for semaphore it dosn't mean, but in 
a hi loaded queue this can lead to a time penalty.
More, having a FIFO queue give a deterministic "time to wait" to a 
blocked process.
Probably I've missed something in Linux semaphore implementation 
and I'd like someone explain to me.
PS: has someone tried the scheduler patch I've submitted yesterday ?
Cheers,
        Davide.
