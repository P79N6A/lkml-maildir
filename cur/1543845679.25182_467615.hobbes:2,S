hmm.  Asking the compiler to pack 16-bit and 64-bit quantities in this
manner is a bit risky.  I guess it'll do the right thing, consistently,
across all compiler versions and vendors and 32-bit-on-64-bit-kernel, etc.
But from a defensiveness/paranoia POV it'd be better to use a u32 here, I
suspect.  (Will access to that loff_t cause an alignment trap on ia64?  Any
other CPUs?  Dunno).

Really?  stat() uses unsigned long and stat64() uses unsigned long long dev_t.

But I wonder if we need to pass the device identified into this ioctl at
all.  What device is the ioctl() against?  ie: what do `filp' and `inode'
point at?  If it's /dev/hda1 then everything we need is right there, is it
not?
ohshit, it's a miscdevice.  I wonder if it would have defined all this
stuff to be operations against the blockdev.  Perhaps not.
Well anyway.  It might be neater to require that userspace open /dev/hda1
and pass in the fd to this ioctl.  But this code will never be neat, so
whatever.
