What kind of motherboard and peripherals are you using?
AKAIK the mediagx only supports one external pci busmaster and only
on a specific "device".
We are using mediaGXm on ETX and had problems with the wiring of the
TVIA CyberPro5050 (combined video+audio controller, audio as busmaster)
Then there are also tweaks in the PCI IDE configuration for mediaGX.
Did you enable that?
