sched domains can provide non overlapping top level partitions.
It would basically just stop the multiprocessor balancing from
moving tasks between these partitions (they would be manually
moved by setting explicit cpu affinities).
I didn't really follow where that idea went, but I think at least
a few people thought that sort of functionality wasn't nearly
fancy enough! :)
