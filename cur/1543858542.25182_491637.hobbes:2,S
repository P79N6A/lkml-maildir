Yes,.. I've read the relevant section shortly after sending that email ;-)
btw & for everybody:
I'm working (as student) at the LRZ (Leibniz Computing Centre) in Munich
where we have very large Linux Cluster and lots of different other
machines,...
I'm going to test for that error on most of the different types of

interesting).
Chris.
