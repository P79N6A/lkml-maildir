Some stupid questions about videomem:
1) How do 2 or more X servers, or svgalibbed apps share the same physical video
memory ? Does it get saved to ram when switching between them ? 
2) Does console switching (gfx or text) save and restore all registers of
videocard in kernel ? Or kernel only restores text things and gfx apps must
it do in their own ?
