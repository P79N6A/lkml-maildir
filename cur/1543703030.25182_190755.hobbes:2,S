No.  Dentries are *never* duplicated.  This goes back to Viro's work on 
allowing a filesystem to be mounted in multiple locations.  See 
http://kt.zork.net/kernel-traffic/kt20000424_64.html#9
 .
What is duplicated is the current->namespace tree of vfsmounts.  After 
this is done, current->fs vfsmount members are updated to point to their 
cloned counterparts.

If triggers in the vfsmount struct are done, then there will be no need 
to handle lookups or revalidates.  In fact, triggers in the vfsmount 
struct will not help at all for indirect maps.

I don't see what you want here.  If you have hundreds of users logged 
into the same machine, you *will* have hundreds of entries in the 
mount-table.

My proposal uses filesystems for all automount mechanism *except* 
expiry. I see expiry as a VFS service, and strongly believe that this is 
where it belongs.
