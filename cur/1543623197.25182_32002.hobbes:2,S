Interesting, I get 11.6MB/s peaks with multiple 100mbits.
3COM's have been great here.
I have 4-5 100mbit 3COM NICS (905bs) (PCI).
And about 10-20 10mbits (ISA+PCI).
All have worked great!
Usually when people have problems with 10/100mbit, they have a half duplex hub or
something lol.
As far as speed is concerned:
Half Duplex hub = Worst
Full Duplex hub = Better
100mbit full duplex switch = best
