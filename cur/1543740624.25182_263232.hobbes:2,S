yeah, and i have to say that such advocacy mostly comes from the natural
desire to solve those _other_ problems that non-standard locking designs
have with Linux mutexes. But those problems are that of the other trees
alone, not upstream's :) Suggesting that those problems are in any way
upstream's problem, even if well-intentioned, can be quite offensive.
