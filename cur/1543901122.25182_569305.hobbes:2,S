While we are here:
The whole check_safety() in kprobes.c seems awkward.. freezing processes
is probably costly, and the check:
if (p != current && p->state == TASK_RUNNING && p->pid != 0) {
Adds restrictions about where a probe can be safely put.. the idle
thread becomes a restriction.
I suggest disabling preemption in the int3 handler, just before
single-stepping, then reenabling it in the breakpoint handler executed
right after the single-step. A synchronize_sched() could then replace
the whole check_safety() and would never fail. The side-effect would be
to disable preemption in the single-step, it's no big deal.
