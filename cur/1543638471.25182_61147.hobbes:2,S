For a LinuxWorld presentation in August, I have asked each of the
4 journaling filesystems (ext3, reiserfs, JFS, and XFS) what their
filesystem/filesize limits are.  Here's what they have told me.
                      ext3fs     reiserfs     JFS     XFS
max filesize:         16 TB#      1 EB       4 PB$   8 TB%
max filesystem size:   2 TB      17.6 TB*    4 PB$   2 TB!
Notes:
#: think sparse files
*: 4 KB blocks
$: 16 TB on 32-bit architectures
%: 4 KB pages
!: block device limit
