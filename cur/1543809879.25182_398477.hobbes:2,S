.event is one of these:
#define PM_EVENT_ON 0
#define PM_EVENT_FREEZE 1
#define PM_EVENT_SUSPEND 2
Which only says what to do - turn on or off (AFAICT, FREEZE and SUSPEND
are synonymous). They are designed to work when the entire system is being
suspended or resumed, since every device is most likely going into its
lowest power state.
However, some devices support >1 low-power state which can be used to save
power while the system is otherwise fully up and running. Devices that are
not being used will most likely use the lowest power state, but devices
that are idle (and that support >1 low power state) can use the other
states even when idle.
In reality, there aren't many devices or drivers that support >1 low-power
state. But, there are some and likely to be more. And, the interface had
always supported it until some time in the 2.6.16 development cycle.
Does that help?
Thanks,
