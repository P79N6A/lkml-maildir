I am having problems with some PCI devices being
configured incorrectly. The PCI bus layout is as
follows:
# lspci -t
-[00]-+-00.0
      +-01.0-[01]----00.0
      +-07.0
      +-07.1
      +-07.2
      +-07.3
      +-08.0
      +-09.0-[02]--+-06.0
      |            +-07.0
      |            \-09.0
      \-0a.0-[03]--+-06.0
                   +-06.1
                   \-07.0
All devices except the bridge 00:0a.0 and/or the
03:07.0 device gets configured correctly. 
The 03:07.0 device has I/O ports at de00 but the
00:0a.0 bridge is configured to have I/O behind
bridge: 0000e000-0000efff. Since de00 is not in 
this range access to device 03:07.0 is impossible.
If I understand correctly an error like this is
caused by a BIOS error. Has anyone else seen
problems like this and what is the suggested fix ?
I'm running a 2.2.19 kernel and have tried the
bios, nobios and nopeer options to the kernel with
the same results.
Thanks in advance,
Lars Knudsen
