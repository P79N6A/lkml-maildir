Subject: [PATCH 0/4] proc: Cleanup status files.

There is a long standing ugliness with /proc/<pid>/stat,
/proc/<pid>/statm, and /proc/<pid>/status that they do not
use the seqfile API.
In addition they are currently reporting pids in the pid namespace
of the current task instead of the pid namespace with which proc
was mounted which is confusing.
This patch series first build the infrastructure to allow these
problems to be fixed and then it converts the individual proc
status files.
