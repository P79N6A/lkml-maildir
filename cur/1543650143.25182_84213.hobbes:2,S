According to my tests, AES ASM has given me _2x_ speed boost over C; this
fact has re-written freeswan CPU/bandwidth empirical formula to peak at
       CPU [MHz] ~= BW [Mbit/s] * 10      (instead of 25)
This boost has allowed my old Cyrix-6x86 120MHz to be my 802.11b gateway  =)
--Juanjo       freeswan algo: AES (+others), SHA2, MODP2048-4096 
               selectable algorithms support for Phase1 and 2.
