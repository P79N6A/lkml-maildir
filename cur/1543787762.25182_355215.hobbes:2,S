Hi,
Firstly, sorry about the long posting.
I have a new system with an Asus K8N mainboard (nforce3 250 chipset)
which locks up every time there
is heightened hard disk activity.
Here's my configuration:
Asus K8N motherboard (nforce3 250 chipset)
AMD Sempron 3100+ processor
GEForce Fx5500 based graphics card
ATA100 compatible 40GB Seagate hard drive (not serial ATA).
Linux kernel version: 2.6.13.2
Here's what I've tried so far (mostly from nforce2 lockup threads on this list.)
1. most of the kernel options that are suggested to resolve this:
noapic, nolapic, acpi_skip_timer_override.
2. I have tried Ross Dickson's patches: io-edge and the delayed timer
IRQ interrupt patch. What I've done is that I've seen which functions
these patches actually change, and made the changes by hand to the
appropriate places in the 2.6.13.2 tree.
3. I have also tried to increase the delay component in the timer IRQ
delay patch (apic_tack=1) to something like 2000, but I still get the
same problem.
4. I have also tried the 'C1 halt' patch where the CPU avoids to get
into this state. But I've had the same effect.
5. Reducing the dma speed using 'hdparm' or even switching off dma
completely and switching to PIO mode does not seem to help. However
this does seem to add some resistance to getting into a lockup
situation. If in UDMA4 I can copy upto a 15MB file to another
partition, with PIO, this goes upto something like 40Mb - but for file
sizes beyond that again the same effect. I've tried this in
combination with 1-4 above as well.
6. I am sure that this is not a hardware issue with the hard drive as
it works fine with another computer(that obviously has a different IDE
controller) and the same kernel.
Here's the kernel call stack before the crash:
(This was done by hand - I couldn't copy this as the computer freezes
when this output is shown.
Although I am sure the function names are correct, some of the numbers
besides them may be wrong.)
[<c02155bd>] end_that_request_last+0x7d/0xd0
[<c011889e>] __wake_up+0x2e/0x40
[<c012faaa>]  __wake_up_bit+0x2a/0x30
[<c018192c>] mpage_end_io_read+0x4e/0xa0
[<e0855284>] clone_end_io+0xe4/0x150 [dm_mod]
[<c02153d9>]  __end_that_request_first+0xe9/0x230
[<c012cfec>]  ide_dma_intr+0xa0/0xf0
[<c013c83d>] handle_IRQ_event+0x3d/0x70
[<c013c916>] __do_IRQ+0xa6/0x110
[<c01056a9>] do_IRQ+0x19/0x30
[<c0103af2>] common_interrupt+0x1a/0x20
Code: (followed by a lot of numbers)
<0> Kernel panic- not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt
I have also attached the output of 'lspci -v' and my .config.
My questions are as follows:
1. I'd like to have some pointers with regards to understanding the
kernel call stack listed above and how to use it to debug the issue.
Any pointers in this direction would be helpful.
2. I've heard/read that one can use the nmi_watchdog functionality to
debug what's happening. Any pointers to a 'HOWTO' on this topic would
be helpful.
3. I've struggled with this problem for about a week now and am
frankly left without any options to try out. Any ideas about trying
out something would be appreciated.
Regards
Abhijeet
