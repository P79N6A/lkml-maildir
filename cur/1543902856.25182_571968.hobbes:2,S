Thanks, I missed that information. Unfortunately this change still does 
not help if one of these stacks needs to grow beyond 4K.

Userspace can't work correctly after the kernel crashed, but it can fail 
gracefully if it can't create enough threads.
I'd really like to be able to select 4K stacks, but as long as that stack
would overflow, I can't, and it can't be default, too.
