Ok, I just found out that Alan Cox has added the driver to the
mainstream kernel.  I added this as a module in make menuconfig and
compiled it.  When I try to use it as a module, after the ppp
connection is made the device is failed to register and I get in 
/var/log/messages: sb1000: failed to register  device (io: 000,000 irq:
7)"  When i try to add it directly in the kernel I get the error
message when compiling the kernel: Space.c:828: `sb1000_probe' undeclared here 
(not in a function) 
Space.c:828: initializer element for `sb1000_dev.init' is not constant.
