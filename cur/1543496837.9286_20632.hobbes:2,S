I'm writing a program called cdctl (it's registered on Freshmeat), which I
intend to provide a full user interface to the kernel cdrom ioctls.  I'm
starting to implement track reading and things, and I think that no one uses
the cdte_datamode of the cdrom_tocentry struct.  I did an rgrep in the
kernel, and found that the sbpcd driver doesn't appear to use it for
anything useful, and the scsi driver gets it from the value of cdte_ctrl;
doesn't show up anywhere else.  I'm also not sure about cdte_adr; it looks
like only the scsi driver uses it, and gets it from the buffer returned from
the low-level call.  Since I'm unfamiliar with the scsi protocol, I'm not
sure if it's using cdte_adr for anything useful or not.  
The optcd driver has a comment indicating it doesn't know what to stick in
cdte_datamode, and I see hints that other drivers don't really know what
these values are for.  
Are these struct elements just cruft?  I'd love to either document them as
such or get rid of them entirely in 2.3.
By the way, does anyone know who maintains /drivers/scsi/sr-ioctl.c? 
MAINTAINERS says that the scsi subsystem is unmaintained...
