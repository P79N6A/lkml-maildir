  i believe you're missing the whole point.  Alexey summed it up nicely

  if you're wanting something different then you either don't understand
  and/or you're doing something wrong!
i think you're the one who's possibly failing to understand.
to say a route is implicit is definitely not correct! if it was
then there wouldn't be any need for a route command! How can you
know from:
ifconfig 192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev eth0 up
what route i want? 
maybe i want to add a policy route, and i don't want the
"implicit" route to be up for even a millisecond. maybe i want a
different window size, maybe i want to do a whole load of strange
things, maybe i don't even want to have a route... who's to say
what i want?
having to delete/modify routes that you didn't ever setup is
silly.
this feature doesn't appear to solve any problems (if it does i'd
be glad to know), just creates some for me, and a lot of others.
diald needs to be fixed for one. I'll have a look at it, but i'm
not much of a coder, and it'll take me month(s) to figure it out.
if it ain't broke don't fix it...
