With your code, the most killed processes are syslogd and
klogd. I welcome improvements to my code, but ininformed and
rude rejections don't help at all.
I'm looking forward to any improvements in the oom code, but
reverting to code that kills syslog just because you don't
like the way the code was written doesn't look like an
improvement to me.
looking forward to your patch,
regards,
Rik
