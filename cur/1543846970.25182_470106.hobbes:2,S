Thanks for posting it to the systemtap wiki.
Some minor style suggestions follow:

These could be collapsed into a single statistics-aggregate array: 
#          ifxmit[pid(), dev_name] <<< length
Then the printing routine would use @count(ifxmit[...]) and @sum(ifxmit[...])
to extract the two values.  Same of course for ifrecv.

Calling pid() so many times is worse than calling it once and caching
the result in a local variable ("p = pid()").  
The way that the script tracks pid-to-uid and pid-to-execname mappings
is not bad, though if that part were moved to new probes on fork or
exec, it would allow the network-related probes to run concurrently on
an SMP without fighting over locks.
