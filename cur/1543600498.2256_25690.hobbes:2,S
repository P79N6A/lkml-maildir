Would it not suffice, in the common case, to check if the
local address that the SMTP connection was accepted on is
the same as the IP address in the email address?
As I see it, it breaks only for multihomed relays or weird
configurations, (with values of "breaks" close to "incurs
an extra SMTP transaction").
You could even maintain a cache of IPs that SMTP connections
had been accepted on.
