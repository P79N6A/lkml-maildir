Happy I could help. :-)

Hmm, the document explains the setting but not exactly how to change 
them. cat printk gives me:
1       4       1       7
which according to the doc means:
- console_loglevel: messages with a higher priority than
   this will be printed to the console
- default_message_level: messages without an explicit priority
   will be printed with this priority
- minimum_console_loglevel: minimum (highest) value to which
   console_loglevel can be set
- default_console_loglevel: default value for console_loglevel
Are my settings not enough? How to change them? Using echo x y z w > 
bla/printk ?
Another q: I guess I should enable frame pointers in kernel compilation 
otherwise I won't get call traces, right?
bye,
Prakash
