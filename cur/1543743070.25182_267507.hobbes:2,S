I've been extensively testing it at this end and recommend giving it a 
good -mm run. I'm reasonably sure it's related to some of the 
disproportionate cpu usage reports we've seen with some of those bash 
script examples (can't recall the details now so I'll need to chase them 
up). If I didn't suspect it was an issue I wouldn't be keen to undo 
something either.
