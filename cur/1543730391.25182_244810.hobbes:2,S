Hello,
    Enhanced Linux System Accounting is now available for kernel 2.6.8.1. This patch implements a solution for managing a group of process (called a bank) in order to provide accounting values like memory, I/O or CPU usage. Process can be added to or removed from a bank using the "elsacct" device interface with ioctl. There is no major improvements since the "bank" mechanism is working well.  
    The next step is to provide more accounting metrics. Therefore we are working on the improvement of BSD accounting as ELSA accounting is based on it. We currently trying to get informations about I/O as fields are already present in BSD-like accounting but they are not updated.
    You can download the patch from the elsa website at:
