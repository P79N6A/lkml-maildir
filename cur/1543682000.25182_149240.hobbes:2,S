Hi!

Thanks for a report. If it came with a patch it would be better
;-). I'll take a look.

This is certainly not okay. Andrew, you know more about vm
internals... What does this ugly constant mean? Would it be possible
to somehow make it variable and set it to zero during software suspend
memory freeing?
