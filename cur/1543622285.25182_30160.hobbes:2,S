This indicates that your A30P has a local-APIC capable P6-class
cpu, and that you're not using the latest 2.4.18-pre or -rc kernel.
The APIC error at resume from suspend is fixed in current 2.4.18-rc,
so a simple kernel upgrade will silence that message.
Your machine survives APM suspend? That's encouraging since I've
had a report that the T20 doesn't if the local APIC is enabled.
What's the difference between suspend and hibernate?
Does the machine survive if you pull the power cord or enter the
BIOS setup screens?
