Sorry, IANAL of course, but IMHO this can't be true:
If the copyright holder puts a note on his code saying it is released 
under version 2 of the GPL then clearly neither the "or any later" nor the 
"not specified" cases apply. And I really fail to see how one could 
argue this were an additional restriction compared to GPL v2 literally!
Btw, you aren't saying linux-kernel would *not* come with a valid GPL, 
according to linux/COPYING, are you?
