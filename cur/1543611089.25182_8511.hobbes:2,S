I have a version that supports everything, including the journal, 
and does not "barf" on writes.  Unfortunately it's written in 
"merkey code style" which is ThoseF_ckingLongAssNamesForEveryDamnFunction()
I was trained to write at Novell.   Merging it into the sourceforge
version will be nasty.  I have a few other projects and code I 
am tardy in sending to Brazil :-).  I think just letting Anton
review some of it may be a better approach.  NWFS is first 
up and needs to get finished and in so if I get hit by 
a truck or killed by a deranged Novell employee who has 
been recently laid off, someone can take maintain it.
