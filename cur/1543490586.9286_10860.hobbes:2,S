Subject: [patch] io/irq are CONFIG_ options in mcd (mitsumi single-speed CDROM)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Dear Linus,
This patch gets rid of '#define I_WAS_THERE' approach whereby users
(including the clueless ones) have to edit the drivers/cdrom/mcd.h to set
io base address and irq number for their CDROM unless they want to see a
compilation warning telling that something maybe wrong.
It makes the code overall smaller and configuration more "user-friendly".
So, I am going to go through any other places that require "user source
editing" and turn them into CONFIG_ options (if reasonable), unless you
(or many other people) tell me not to do it.
Also, how about a separate section "Kernel Tuning" where all defaults used
in /proc/sys can be adjusted + some new onesI have in mind, e.g. the
modprobe_path length (defaults to 256 but one needs to edit two places to
change it)? If nobody objects perhaps I shall do this as well?
Regards,
Tigran.
PS.I can see only one objection to this patch saying "but when I configure
sound
subsystem it does not let me set io/irq if I choose M (module)...." Those
who say this are advised to read carefully drivers/sound/* files and see
the way it is done there - that should answer their objection. Also, look
in ftape driver and see that it *is* a good idea to be able to specify
default io/irq for a module (unless one has a rich infrastructure like the
sound one).
