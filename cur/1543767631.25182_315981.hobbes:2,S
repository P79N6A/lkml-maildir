The patch I proposed does not add any lock_kernel() based locking. The 
only locking it adds is more tty_sem based locking to cover the 
driver->open() method. I agree though that it relies on the BKL for 
correctness.
Indeed, that is precisely that patch which introduced the problems I've 
pointed out.

The patch I proposed fixes the open vs. open race using the tty_sem. The 
open vs. close race is closed by removing locking. Less locking seems 
better to me. 
If you're still not happy, I'll wrap the close path in the tty_sem...
