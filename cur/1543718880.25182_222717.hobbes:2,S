To avoid being punched out, I plan on waiting until about a year
into the 2.7.x series before submitting patches (via the maintainers
this time) to change out the accumulating speling erors.  That
will hopefully* minimize conflict with the initial surge of patches
at the beginning and the stabilization period near the end.
*hopefully used as a sentence adverb.
