I've noticed kernels 2.4.7, 2.4.8 and 2.4.9 can oops when modprobing
floppy.o under certain circumstances (specifically I've noticed it when
rc.sysinit does "/sbin/pam_console_apply -r",which appears to cause the
floppy driver to be modprobed).  There doesn't seem to be a problem if the
floppydriver is compiled into the kernel instead of being modular.
NOTE: I'm testing these kernels on Cobalt kit, which doesn't have a floppy
drive (and does some very odd things at the hardware/firmware side
occasionally :).  So I can't vouch for how this will affect
"normal" hardware.
