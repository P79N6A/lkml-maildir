one question:
When I was using ext2 I always mounted the /usr partition read-only, so
that a fsck weren't necessary at boot - and the files were all guaranteed
to be OK to bring the system up at least.
Does this (mount -o ro) make sense with ReiserFS as well? What I mean is,
is there a chance of a file getting corrupted that was only *read* (not
*written*) at or before a power outage?
I mount all my system partitions with -o notail,noatime if that makes any
difference.
