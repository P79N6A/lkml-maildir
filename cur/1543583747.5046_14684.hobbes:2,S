Heh, I know, thanks ;)
However, our current scheme implies a hack to __sti() that I'd like to get
rid of since it adds an overhead allover the place that could probably be
localized if we managed to force an interrupt (using the DEC for example,
or using a mac-specific device as this controller only exist on macs anyway).
Also, we currently don't use the same mecanism as i386, and since Linus
expressed his desire to have irq.c become generic, I'm trying to make sure
I fully understand it before merging in PPC the bits that I didn't merge
them yet.
Ben.
