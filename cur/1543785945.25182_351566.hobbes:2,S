For what it's worth sometimes people get emotional and frustrated and 
sometimes people can be difficult at thimes to work with. But - for what 
it's worth - I think people should ignore some of that as human nature 
and look at the big picture.
And the big picture is ....
Hans has make a huge contribution with Reiser 3 and eventually Reiser 4 
is going to be something that will greatly enhance the kernel and 
advance Linux the way Reiser 3 has done. Wasn't Resiser 3 the first 
journalling file system for Linux that actually worked?
So - I say - if it doesn't break anything else - why not throw it into 
the mail kernel? It will get there eventually and if it's there sooner 
them more people will be out there trying to break it and it will 
develop faster. I don't know personally how stable it is - but from what 
I understand it is winning the speed tests and that will shave some time 
off of everything the rest of us do. And even if it is somewhat broken - 
in a few months it will all be fixed.
And Hans is apparently ready to take abuse if it's broken.
So I say - lets do it already.
My 2 centz ....
