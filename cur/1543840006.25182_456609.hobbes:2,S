Perhaps I mis-recall, but shouldn't delayed writes (or something along 
those lines) cause a case where two files are being incrementally
written rare?  It seems that this case would only occur if two processes
were writing two files in small chunks and calling fsync constantly
(*cough* evolution column resizing bug *cough*), PLUS the two would
have to have the same offset (or close) for the file writes.
It seems that the risk of fragmentation is a lesser danger than the full
system near lock-up caused by the old behavour.
