We had one of the very first SMP AlphaServers: OSF/1 T3.0-1 was the
version ("T" for "Field Test"). After years and years of serious
problems (panics left right and centre, a new one every week), DEC
admitted that the SMP support in the OSF/1 codebase was basically
"proof of concept", never tested in real life and had to be rewritten
from scratch for DEC OSF/1 (which became Digital UNIX (which became
Tru64 UNIX)).
Solaris was never Mach based as far as I know. MacOS X is, I thought,
BSD 4.4 based. I've never got the impression that IRIX was Mach-ish
either, though I haven't done much with the IRIX boxes around here.
