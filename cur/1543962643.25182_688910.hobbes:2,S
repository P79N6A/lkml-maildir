You know what, I think there might be an even simple solution.
How about just setting a bit saying it is canceled - and nothing more. 
Then, the dequeue logic can be just taught to ignore those things.
Doesn't that sound like the simple way to cancel signals? Make 
collect_signal() just do a "return 0" if the signal has been flushed..
