I don't think that is true, at least on this level. Firstly, splice-cp
does this:
#define BS	SPLICE_SIZE
int this_len = min((off_t) BS, sb.st_size);
int ret = splice(in_fd, NULL, pfds[1], NULL, this_len, 0);
No considerations are made regarding page size.
Secondly, the problem still exists when I increase SPLICE_SIZE to
(128*1024)
