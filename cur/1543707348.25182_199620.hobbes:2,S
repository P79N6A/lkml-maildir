I think you can use libicu here. Conversion to UCS-4 doesn't for determining
character type doesn't mean you will every have actual strings of UCS-4. It could 
be character by character just for looking it up, so you can have the out-of-band
error flags internally.

Agree. \u80808080 I would assume represents a valid character, while \x80\x80\x80\x80
does not. A problem with invalid sequences I just noted is that they break some of 
the nice properties of UTF-8, that people will assume apply, i.e. that you can parse it 
backwards. With UTF-8 (i.e. well-formed utf-8) you can point at a byte and figure "this is 
not the first byte", lets skip backwards to find the start. If invalid sequences can ever occur
you must read from the start of the string.
