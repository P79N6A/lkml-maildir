This is due to a bug in kmail, and the reiserfs_file_write patch.
One thing which that patch does is to increase the stat.st_blksize hint
which reiserfs provides to applications.  By a lot - from 4k to 128k I
think.
Problem is, some KDE apps see that hint and then promptly balls it up. 
They read 128k at offset 0, then 128k at offset 4k, then 128k at offset 8k,
etc.
Apparently, upgrading kmail will fix it.
