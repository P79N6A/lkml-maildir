Sorry for the problems caused by this patch. Here is a fix for your
convenience. Will you send it to Linus or I should do this?
From: Artem Bityutskiy <Artem.Bityutskiy@nokia.com>
Subject: [PATCH] UBIFS: do not use WB_SYNC_HOLD
WB_SYNC_HOLD is going to be zapped so we should not use it. Use
%WB_SYNC_NONE instead. Here is what akpm said:
"I think I'll just switch that to WB_SYNC_NONE.  The `wait==0' mode is
just an advisory thing to help the fs shove lots of data into the
queues.  If some gets missed then it'll be picked up on the second
->sync_fs call, with wait==1."
Thanks to Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com> for catching this.
