Jiffies is defined as "unsigned long volatile __jiffy_data jiffies". On i386
machines unsigned long is 32.

Right, HZ is defined as USER_HZ which can be set over the config. On normal
desktop systems it should be 1000 on other machines it could also be 100 or
250. Either we can ignore the setting and the function depends on the
USER_HZ config, or we have to calculate the right value with USER_HZ.

What is it?

Not really gettimeofday is based on the date and time, but what if the user
changes the date, the counter would also change.
