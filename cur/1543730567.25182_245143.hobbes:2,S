... and that's similar to the hole into which IOC3 is falling.  IOC3 is a
multi function device - but not in sense of the PCI spec.  IOC3 provides a
standard ethernet interface with the usual gadgets like PHY interfacing.
It also contains a PS/2 keyboard / mouse interface (thanks to which my
headless Origin 200 has each 4 keyboard and mouse connectors!), a
486-style backside bus on which a standard PC SuperIO chip providing
the 16552s and a RTC chip are hooked up.  As things are right now each of
these functions is provided by a different driver and there is no
central coordination that ensures pci_disable_device() will only be called
by the time the last driver has finished it's business.  As consequence
until we can cleanly handle this is not calling pci_disable_device().
Since the original posting I also found that the original argument about
interrupt routing is bogus; in violation of the PCI spec IOC3 supports
multiple interrupt pins.  On IP27 (Origin, Onyx 2) they're all just wired
together re-establishing PCI compliance.  That's not the case on Octane
which needs special handling outside of what the normal PCI code provides.
