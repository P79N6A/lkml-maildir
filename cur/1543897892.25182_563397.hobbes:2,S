Again, this isn't an area where I have great expertise...
Adding signalling into kthread_stop would seem to be making some
assumptions about how kthreads are used and how they should respond to
signals. That sounds unsafe and might potentially limit flexibility.
agree with Oleg here -- I don't see the benefit to doing this for all
kthreads. If you're aware that your kthread might be blocked on a call,
then it doesn't seem burdensome to add in an extra send/force_sig call.
