Well my maestro3 works fine recording; cat /dev/dsp gives lots of rubbish.
I have however noticed that on odd occasion it just stops working (no playing
or nothing.. totally dead) and a reboot is required to get functionality back. 
Anyone had this problem before? 
This is the maestro3 from the Inspiron 8100.  Here is the relevant data:
maestro3: version 1.22 built at 20:12:16 Nov 13 2001
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 02:03.0
maestro3: Configuring ESS Maestro3(i) found at IO 0xEC00 IRQ 5
maestro3:  subvendor id: 0x00e61028
