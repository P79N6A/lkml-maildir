I like it, see comments.

Well, I think it might be cleaner to just drop the i8042_ prefix and go
with the "i8042." prefix if that's the 2.6 way. It'll annoy a couple
people, but's it's the way to go in the future.

Ok here we remove the timer.

Note it's not for autorepeats. It's for problems with characters stuck
in the controller (like if the mouse sends a byte and the interface is
not enabled, blocking the controller indefinitely), we poll the
controller now and then making sure no characters are forgotten there.

Good.
