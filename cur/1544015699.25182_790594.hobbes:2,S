Iirc it copies data from skb to the new pipe page unconditionally while
it is needed only for skb->sendpage path, although it is not possible to
know what is the other side of the pipe (or not?).
What about storing a callback and private pointer in the shared info for
the skb and clone them during usual clone, and invoke the callback at
shared info freeing time, which in turn will call spd->spd_release()?
Given that we only need to protect linear part, it should be simple
enough and we will not need to mess with the pskb_expand* calls.

As a long-term solution this sounds as the best case, but introduces
quite heavy overhead for the allocators. Right now we allocate
1500+shared_info rounded up to the nearest power of the two (2k), but
then we will either need to have own network allocator (I have one :) or
allocate PAGE_SIZE+shared_info rounded up to the pwoer of the two (i.e.
8k), which is unfeasible.
