No.
It may do a best-effort thing. It may also do a best-_performance_ thing, 
in leaving interrupts disabled over a piece of code that doesn't care, 
knowing that disabling interrupts is expensive.  Or it may just be a 
simple case of simplicity: disable interrupts over the whole region, 
knowing that only a part of it matters.
It by no means is automatically a bug. And it unquestionably _does_ 
happen. We used to warn about it. We stopped.
