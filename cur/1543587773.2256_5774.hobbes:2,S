Of course it does; in an idiosyncratic way (not directly using X
resources) but it does use the X resource file syntax.

It's in Ousterhout's Tcl/Tk book as well as in the Perl/Tk intro by
Walsh. ;-) Tk calls this "option database" or similar. The only catch
is that it needs to be explicitly loaded, see "optionReadfile" (at
least that's what it's called in perl/tk).
