Actually I've wanted to report the same problem - I even believe
I've already reported this long time ago in the dark ages when
everyone has been saying some stupid things about BP6...
Usualy reading CD-ROM && hdparm -t /dev/hda was quite easy way
to deadlock the whole system.
Now I would say that 2.4.17rc2 becames more stable but still I've
been faced with similar problem - I have tried to read damaged CD with
movie 
and this is part of log:
begin of errors - please notice the TIME values!

deadlock here   after   'U' - reset button required

And looping for loooong time without any progress here - around some
numbers.
I've tried then to use   'dd'  with conv=noerror  but I had
to skip error part manualy via skip simply because linux was unable
to make any progress here even after 10 minutes.
I guess my CD-ROM was in DMA mode initialy but after it switchies DMA of
the computer becomes almost unusable.
Another problem I would like to see solved one day - why just my machine
is completely unable while anacron does it's jobs ???
Why there couldn't be option in /proc to set limit for maximum amount of
RAM 
for caching filesystem ??? (like 30MB from my 128MB ram ?)
(I think I know better what I need that the Linux VM)
