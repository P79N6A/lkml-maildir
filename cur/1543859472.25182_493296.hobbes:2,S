Please send in a patch for 2.4. It's very important to have a
very reliable ultraconservative tested kernel available.

I suppose the last time I looked at that code, khubd still took
BKL. Or I overlooked the race. I have no serial devices since
the cell phone broke.

Look closer. If you build with preemption, taking BKL disables preemption.
BKL is effective only until you schedule. On UP, without preemption
ordinary kernel code will not reenter. You need no lock that doesn't guard
against interrupts unless you schedule under these narrow conditions.
Could you test the attached patch against 2.6?
