That was my first thought, which prompted my
initial patch of the hvc drivers.
Requiring a call to schedule processing of tty data
after preallocating buffer space is not obvious,
and could result in scheduling work when there is no
data to process.
This semantic twist introduced by my first locking patch
is a hazard for driver writers, and would require an audit
of existing drivers (as demonstrated by Olaf's report).
