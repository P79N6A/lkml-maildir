It's the only way to go in some situations.  Sometimes the kernel just
cannot predict the future sufficiently well, and the costs of making a
mistake are terribly high.  We need human help.  And it should be
administration-time help, not programming-time help.

This is all fun stuff, but how do we find out that changes like this are
good ones, apart from shipping it and seeing who gets hurt 12 months later?
