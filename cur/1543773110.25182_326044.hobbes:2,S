I have a patch that optionally enables some of the interesting warnings
that gcc supports (e.g. -Wmissing-format-attribute -Wmissing-declarations
-Wundef -Wwrite-strings).
It has four different levels:
- quiet (current warnings minus -Wdeprecated-declarations)
- normal (some interesting ones added that are not too noisy)
- more (all interesting ones, including some noisier ones like 
  -Wmissing-declarations)
- overkill (-W and some more that only make sense for statistic
  analysis)
I have the base patch and some more patches that fix the most annoying 
warnings. I find them more useful than the signed vs unsigned comparison
fixes you are doing right now, but don't have the time to split my
patches up into obvious chunks.
Jesper, are you interested in my stuff and willing to continue that work?
I'd suggest to fix the warnings at 'normal' level first and then
integrate the patch for configurable warning levels into -mm.
