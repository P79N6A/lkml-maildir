YEP! Mine is F6. Which means, that both of them are 'other than UDMA'. And
since yours supports DMA I'll assume that so does mine too. Which means
that the reason why I can't turn it on is BIOS - from your previous
postings. Please, can anybody here explain, how is this possible, if
ide.txt clearly says the contrary:
"(linux) does not use the BIOS for disk access"
or am I wrong somewhere? Shall I tell the kernel 
'hda=noprobe,... ide0=dma...'
?
