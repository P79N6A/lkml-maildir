Hrm, as it turned out I had my scripts pointing to the netboot version
of mknbi (I remember vaguely having troubles with the etherboot version
back when I started netbooting) which seems to be somewhat limited.
A short test with the 1.2 version of the etherboot mknbi-linux worked as
expected, YAY! Now back to the try to boot a working 2.5 kernel. :)
Thanks for your help!
