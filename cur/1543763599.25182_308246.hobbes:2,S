this one looks like it's not quite complete:

Once there are no more KERNEL_VERSION dependencies in a file, it's
inclusion of linux/version.h can be removed also (and that should
prevent it getting rebuilt every time the kernel version changes).
So it looks like there's an additional KERNEL_VERSION to remove in
dpt/dpti_i2o.h version.h includes in dpti_i2o.h and dpt_i2o.c
Then when you have a final patch, could you cc Markus Lidel
<Markus.Lidel@shadowconnect.com> and  
Mark_Salyzyn@adaptec.com
Thanks,
James
