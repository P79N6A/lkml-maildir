You are mixing apples and oranges. The fact that the GFDL sucks has
nothing to do with the firmware issue. With the current situation of
firmwares in the kernel, it is illegal to redistribute binary images of
the kernel. Full stop. End of story. Bye bye. Redhat and SuSE may still
be willing to distribute such binary images, but it isn't our problem.
Putting the firmwares outside the kernel makes them distributable. Some
distributions will want to include them, some others not. But the
important point is that it makes that redistribution legal.
