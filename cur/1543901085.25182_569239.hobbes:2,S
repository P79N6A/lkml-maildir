Does the machine #3 have a PCI slot connected to a "secondary" bus?
Have you tried with any other machine with a secondary bus?

Could be a hardware/BIOS problem on machines #1 and #2. Could be
a Linux bug as well, though similar configurations are known to work
fine. I don't think it has anything to do with IRQs.
Perhaps it doesn't like a bridge (on the card) behind a bridge
(on the motherboard). I would test with another multiport card
such as old DLink DFE-570TX (using a DEC 21150 bridge and four
21143 Ethernet chips).
I'd probably use some PCI analyzer or, at least, I'd check
the bus state with a multimeter.
