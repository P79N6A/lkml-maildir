That sort of thing happens a lot, I can definitely sympathize with you
there :-)

That's a lot more nifty than my stupid CLONE_IO flag addition. Both are
only good for test purposes though.
It's a bit difficult to make this really mergeable. I don't know
anything about how nfsd manages its thread pool, but something more
appropriate would be an io context per client mount. That's still not
perfect as you could easily have more than one process doing simultanous
IO on the client side, but it's a lot better.
