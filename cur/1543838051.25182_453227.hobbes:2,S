We know the E7520 is able to do the remapping, provided the BIOS does not 
mess it up. I have no idea about the E7210 (or the 875P - I was not aware 
that they were this closely related), but without checking any docs I'm 
assuming a 4G memory ceiling and no remapping capability.
Thank you.

I'd appreciate if you could send me both lspci and /proc/iomem output when 
you get one of these with 4G or more ram installed. Off list, please.
Yours,
