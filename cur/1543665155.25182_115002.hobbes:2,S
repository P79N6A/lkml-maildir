Btw, I think this is exactly what the new HT prescott instructions are
for: instead of having busy loops polling for a change in memory (be it
a spinlock or a "need_resched" flag), new HT CPU's will support a
"mwait" instruction. 
But yes, at least for now, I really don't think you should really _ever_
use "idle=poll" on HT-enabled hardware. The idle CPU's will just suck
cycles from the real work.
