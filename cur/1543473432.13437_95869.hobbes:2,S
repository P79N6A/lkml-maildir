Subject: 2.1.131 size limitations.

Info:
Just installed a new SCSI hard disk on a Linux machine running 2.1.131.
It appears as though mke2fs will not allow operation on a partition
that exceeds about 3++ gigabytes. It errors out with "illegal request"
messages.
It also appears as though mkswap will not allow a swap partition in
excess of about 128 megabytes.
Are these known limitations?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
