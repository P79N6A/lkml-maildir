Well it turns out that didn't help.  Neither does 2.6.18 (that one was
the easiest newer one to try).  It does seem as if the error rate is
lower with 2.6.18 than with 2.6.16, so perhaps there was more than one
place that could cause losses in the tty buffering.  I had only 2
failures in 15 hours with 2.6.18, rather than a whole lot of failures
with 2.6.16.  I guess I will have to try 2.6.19 or even something newer.
