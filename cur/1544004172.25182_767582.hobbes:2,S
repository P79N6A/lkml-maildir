That is not quite correct.  Nothing is routed through hpilo.
The problem is that there is a shared hardware resource in iLO function 2 (hpilo),
and it is used by iLO function 4 (uhci_hcd kdb/mouse).  When hpilo is unloaded,
the pci_device_disable() call removes the ability for this function to act as a
busmaster, which stops the uhci_hcd from functioning correctly.
Reloading hpilo will enable the remote console again.
Removing the pci_disable_device() "fixes" the problem, but doing that worries me.
