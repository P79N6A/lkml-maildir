The waste will be only 0.2% of RAM or 2MB per 1GB. Not much. Perhaps, 
not noticeable for an average user of distro kernels at all. Embedded 
people, who count each byte, almost always don't need iSCSI, so won't 
have any problems to disable 
TCP_ZERO_COPY_TRANSFER_COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION option.
Also, as I wrote, iSCSI-SCST can work without this patch or with 
TCP_ZERO_COPY_TRANSFER_COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION option disabled, but with 
user space device handlers it will work considerably worse. Only few 
distro kernels users need an iSCSI target and only few among such users 
need to use a user space device handler. So, option 
TCP_ZERO_COPY_TRANSFER_COMPLETION_NOTIFICATION can be safely disabled in 
default configs of distro kernels. People who need both iSCSI target 
*and* fast working user space device handler would simply enable that 
option and rebuild the kernel. Rejecting this patch provides much worse 
alternative: those people would also have to *patch* the kernel at 
first, only then enable that option, then rebuild the kernel.

I've just rechecked if any of struct page fields can be shared with 
net_priv field. Unfortunately, it looks like none among the mandatory 
fields:
  - Transmitting pages can be mapped in some user space, so sharing in 
unions with _mapcount, mapping and index fields isn't possible
  - Transmitting pages can be in the page cache, so sharing lru field 
isn't possible as well
It might, however, be shared with field "virtual", since SCST allocates 
only lowmem pages, but on non-HIGHMEM kernels and most HIGHMEM kernels 
WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL isn't defined, so it will change basically nothing.

As I wrote, approach to use net_priv on the skb level was examined, but 
rejected as unpractical. Simply too many places should be modified to 
prevent merging skb's with different net_priv-like labels and those 
places are too inobvious. Implementation of this approach and, 
especially, maintenance it would be just a nightmare.
