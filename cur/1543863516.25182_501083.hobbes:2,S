Subject: [PATCH 2.6.21 0/4] ehca: remove do_mmap() and some bug fixes

Hello Roland!
Here is a patch set for ehca as a result of previous disscussions
and comments:
1. fix improper use of yield within spinlock context
2. fix mismatched use of spin_unlock in irq handler
3. remove do_mmap()
4. remove obsolete prototypes
PS: I've sent the first two recently for 2.6.20, but adding here
for completeness for 2.6.21.
Thanks
Nam
