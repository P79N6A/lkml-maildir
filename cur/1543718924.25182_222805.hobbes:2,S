That's fine with me too. I could definitely see there being 2 or 3
headers that mid-level developers could use to identify the origin of a
patch and they could be documented.
Linus could just concern himself with atleast us subsystem-maintainers
putting the Signed-off-by on there and not worry himself about the other
headers.
Could have something like:
Spotted-by: Foo
Submitted-by: Bar
Signed-off-by: Ben Collins
And if there's a problem, Linus can come knocking on my door for fucking
up, and I'd be the bottom line responsible for the submission. Linus
need only put his confidence on a small subset of patch submitters (like
he mainly does now) doing the Signed-off-by.
