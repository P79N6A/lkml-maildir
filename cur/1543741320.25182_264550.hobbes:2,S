I think -mm *is* what is run by hackers. That said, do you really think 
that it is stable with 4k stack? (that's a real question, it wasn't for 
me in 2.6.8-mm? when I briefly tried it).
I see the major benefits to people running heavy i/o load, like database 
and servers. And those are the users with the most to lose if it still 
has residual learning experiences.
I do think that akpm is capable of deciding when it should go in without 
all this politicing, and I doubt he or Linus care if it makes a vendor 
kernel first, considering all the things in vendor kernels which NEVER 
get to mainline.
