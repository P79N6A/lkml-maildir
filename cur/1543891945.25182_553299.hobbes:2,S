Interesting use case.

You probably need to reset the video mode. Try the s2ram workaround,
specifically "-m".

The Kernel does nothing to the bootloader during suspend. The kernel does not
even know that you are using a bootloader and how it might be configured.
Userland has to do this (and SUSE's pm-utils actually do. I thought the
Fedora pm-utils also did, but i cannot say for sure). "Just" find out which
entry in menu.lst corresponds to the currently running kernel, and preselect
it for the next boot. It is doable.
So it's a problem of your distro's userland (and if you did not use
pm-hibernate to suspend, it is your very own problem).
You could of course simply go for GRUB's "default saved" and "savedefault"
feature, to always boot the last-booted kernel unless changed in the menu.
