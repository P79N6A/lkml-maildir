Because that would mean we could no longer get bug reports
from non-subscribers. Also, some sites (eg transmeta) run
an internal (read-only) linux-kernel newsgroup because some
people find it easier to deal with the volume in news clients.
Also, the volume of email following a spam or asian charset
post always seems to be several times more the volume of those
mails themselves, so the issue really can't be that serious ;)
regards,
Rik
