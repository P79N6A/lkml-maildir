Yes.  While you're bisecting, HEAD is a special "bisect" head used just
for that purpose.  If you encounter a compile error or are otherwise
unable to test a version, you can "git reset --hard <commit>" to jump
to some other commit and test that instead.  Because that command
unconditionally changes both the current head and the checked-out code,
it's normally somewhat dangerous, but while bisecting, there's no problem.
You can choose anything you like to test instead of git-bisect's suggested
version, but staying near the middle of the uncertain range is usually
a good idea.  "HEAD^" (the parent of the current commit) is often a
simple choice.  "git bisect visualize" might give you some ideas.
Note that if the problem actually is in the area of the untestable commit,
git bisect might drag you back there, but this lets you try to avoid it.
It's also worth repeating some advice from the manual:
