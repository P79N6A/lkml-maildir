I saw that the current Fedora already dynamically links /bin/mount
against /usr/lib/libblkid.so. This obviously does not work if
/usr is a separate partition that needs to be mounted with /bin/mount.
I also had problems with selinux claiming I had no right to access
libblkid, which meant that the root fs could not be remounted r/w.
I'd suggest that you make sure that mount always gets statically linked
against libblkid to avoid these problems.
