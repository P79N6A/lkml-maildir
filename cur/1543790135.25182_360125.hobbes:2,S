Without CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK configured in I'm getting a large number 
of "implicit declaration of function ‘__raw_read_unlock’" warnings and a 
subsequent failure at the link stage.
A trivial change to include/linux/spinlock_up.h (i.e. moving the 
definition of __raw_read_unlock() outside the ifdef) can get rid of this 
warning but I'm not sure that it's the right thing to do as I suspect 
this may be an indication of a less trivial problem elsewhere.
