I still do not agree.
You have a system you tried to kick CPU #13 alive, and something very
wrong happened, CPU #13 did not come up. It is there, has full access
to memory, it is probably running some kind of program.... I'd not
dare mount disks read-write in such situation and I believe crashing
early is actually right thing to do.
