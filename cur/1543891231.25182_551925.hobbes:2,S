True, and unfortunately this is not something that can be done right with
what we have now and playing with udev.  Oh dear, I was too hasty to think
that we had all the infrastructure needed already...
Changing system-wide keymap should be a privileged operation.  Changing
per-user keymaps should not screw up any system-wide keymap changes made by
the administrator, and it needs to go away for the next user.
And for multi-user systems, you likely need to be able to switch keyboard
maps when VTs are switched.   This does not look like an easy thing to fix
properly.
The truth is that what we currently have seems suitable only for
system-administrator level changes (aka trusted, global changes), and should
be restricted to CAP_SYSADMIN.

I disagree.  It is one thing to do extremely broken optimizations like not
unloading heads on scsi disks "because it could be in a multiple initiator
system", thus breaking 99% of the systems out there.  It is a very different
thing to not support a multi-user system scenario at all re. keyboard maps.
I don't care if we default for single-user systems, but we definately have
to properly support the multi-user system case, and it *is* a very common
case in business workstations AND home user systems anywhere computers are
not as cheap as a ticket to the movies.
At the very least we need to protect the keymap from untrusted changes while
we don't have anything but system-wide ones.  And we should start working on
per-user (really, copy-on-write per-fd keymaps. Yuck!) or per-VT/pty keymaps
done safely, too.

Agreed.  This is what I see in Brazil.  Most homes have only ONE computer,
when they have one at all.  And most office environments have one computer
per seat, and less seats than there are workers.

Well, the proper fix for this has nothing to do with KEY_UNKNOWN, and it is
per-user/per-VT/pty keymaps and a reset IOCTL (or automatic reset in the
per-user case).

If the input system is going to start breaking The Console now, you can
expect to have me fighting you all the way.  I do agree that a
system-admin-only case for the console is good enough, though: multi user
systems that have to bother with per-user keymaps will be running X or
something like that.

Err... potentially a lot of them could.  Good laptop manufacturers sell
keyboards with the touchpad and hot keys matching the laptop, you know.  It
is what you get for The Boss to go with his shiny dock so that he doesn't
have to plug cables on the laptop, ever (you also get a matching set for his
home and send someone there to set it up for him).  Heck, for thinkpads I
could get even a keyboard with the touchpad and ultranav (the "nipple") if I
wanted!
And keyboards nowadays are *full* of weird keys, many of them unlabelled so
that "gamers" can assign them different functions...
Unlabelled keys are *common* these days.   What I agree to be uncommon is
two or more keyboards per machine with different users on them (i.e.
multi-head boxes), but that's just because Linux is starting to get really
friendly out-of-the-box to multi-head boxes now.  I know they would be using
them like crazy at work if it was something easier to set-up and maintain.

Well, if key_unknown is a very very uncommon thing, we could have the
system-admin-only nature of keyboard remapping (thus avoiding DoS attacks on
multi-user systems). and be done with this.  But for that, we need KEY_MAX
bumped up.
