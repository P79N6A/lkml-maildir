Correct.  I am still reviewing drivers and kernel code to ascertain 
whether I am not leaving any holes.  I have spliced it as a non-obtrusive 
implementation that preserves the existing code with no changes.  
Some of the drivers may have problems if they cache the head address
of the current list.

2.5 would be nice, but 2.4.X needs it too and this is the kernel we are 
using for our development and testing, so we will need it there.
