I agree with Ingo on the "keep it simple" merge steps..
I can't resist mentioning, however, what I'd like to see long term.
I'd like to see mpparse.o depend on CONFIG_MPS=y
I'd like to be able to build CONFIG_ACPI=y and CONFIG_MPS=n
Andy Grover prototyped splititing MPS from ACPI a while back,
but it never made it upstream.
