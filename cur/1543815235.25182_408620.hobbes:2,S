You would set this flag when the file grows over 2^32 sectors in size.
You might optionally clear it if the file shrinks below 2^32 sectors.
At that time you would take the old i_blocks value and (>> (blockbits - 9)).

I don't mean that we would remove the COMPAT flag (Ted and I arE just
having a discussion in another thread whether i_blocks inaccuracy
should be an ROCOMPAT or INCOMPAT feature)).  If a kernel understands
the {RO,IN}COMPAT_LARGE_BLOCK flag, then they would also understand
EXT2_LARGEBLK_FL on the inode to mean "i_blocks is in fs-blocksize units",
so no corruption would take place.  If the kernel can't understand the
COMPAT flag, it would not mount (INCOMPAT, which is inconvenient for the
users) or mount read-only (ROCOMPAT, wouldn't allow file to be modified).
The same is true for e2fsprogs.
The real goal is that setting ?COMPAT_LARGE_BLOCK doesn't immediately
make all OTHER files in the filesystem have incorrect i_blocks values,
which would be MUCH more of a problem than files > 2TB having inaccurate
i_blocks counts.
Cheers, Andreas
