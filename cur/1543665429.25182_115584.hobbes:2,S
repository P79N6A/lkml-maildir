Yes.
[Silly enough. The entire business of registration does not
depend at all on whether one is a character or a block device.
I am really unhappy with the fact that the completely uniform
code that we used to have now has been split into two rather
separate pieces of code.]
But you are quite right that an audit is needed.
[I think I described the amount of work as: two hours to make
the patches, a weekend to do the audit.]
