No, though I did receive an offline reply from someone who appeared
to have misunderstood the post.  In case it wasn't clear, the problem
is that the above program behaves differently when traced to how it
behaves when not traced.  (I do realise that in general, under newer
Unices, when not ignored, a SIGCHLD signal may accompany the death of
a child.)

It's not clear to me whether it is a kernel, glibc or strace bug, but
it does appear to be a bug.
