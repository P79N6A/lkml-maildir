 ...   
   the L2 cache was the limiting factor
I'm not talking about cpu second level cache, I'm talking about
a second level lookup table that backs up a front end routing
hash.  A software data structure.
You are talking about a lot of independant things, but I'm going
to defer my contributions until we have actual code people can
start plugging netfilter into if they want.
About using syslog to record messages, that is doomed to failure,
implement log messages via netlink and use that to log the events
instead.
