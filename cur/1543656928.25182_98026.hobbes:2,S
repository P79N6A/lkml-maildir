This is great.  The question remains of what to do with
MODULE_PARM_DESC(), currently an empty macro.
Reverting them to be stored in ".modinfo" section as was done
previously is trivial, but as they are now also boot parameters, which
points to a DocBook-style solution.
The same arguments apply to MODULE_AUTHOR, and MODULE_DESCRIPTION.
Preferences anyone?
Rusty.
