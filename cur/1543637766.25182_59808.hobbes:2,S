*nods* Both Jens and Doug were invaluable at times when I bought forward a
bunch of stuff from 2.4, (and later scooped up various other small
SCSI bits from assorted places).  With a lack of much understanding
in this area, (and lack of motivation to dig too deeply -- I don't even
own any SCSI hard disks/controllers except for some ancient cpqarray thats
rarely powered on), pushing the various bits onto you with meaningful
comments attached became quite hard work, and at times, impossible
without further explanation from Jens or Doug.
Thankfully, Doug did an excellent job at weeding out the crap bits I had
merged, and pushing on the good tried-n-tested bits.
So they both get my vote. James I think is actually doing some of the
grunt work which means offloading the 'syncing/pushing to Linus' fun
onto one of the others is probably a good idea if they're not opposed to
doing it.
