The part that I am missing is how this helps in the case where a non-RT
task gets preempted in the middle of an RCU read-side critical section
indefinitely.  Or are you boosting the priority of any task that
enters an RCU read-side critical section?

OK, good point.

Yep.  As would the things protected by the dcache lock, task list lock,
and so on, right?
