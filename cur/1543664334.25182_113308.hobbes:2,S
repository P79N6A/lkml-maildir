Wouldn't it be best to keep /root on the root filesystem?
It is rarely large, and if you need to log in as root to
fix some mounting problem, I guess you want your home
directory.

What is the point in making mnt a local directory? All
it contains are some directories to serve as mountpoints.
I guess you are going to mount something on top of every
subdirectory in mnt anyway.
