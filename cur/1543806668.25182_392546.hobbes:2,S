This patch introduces an issue for me an embedded PowerPC SoC using the 
8250 driver.
The simple description of my issue is this:  I'm using the serial port for
both a terminal and console.  I run fdisk on a /dev/hda.  Before this
patch I would get the prompt for fdisk immediately.  After this patch I
have to hit return before the prompt is displayed.
I know that's not a lot of info, but just let me know what else you need 
to help debug this.
I'm guessing something about the UARTs on the PowerPC maybe bit a little 
non-standard.
thanks
