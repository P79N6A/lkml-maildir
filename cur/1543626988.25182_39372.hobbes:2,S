As I understand, Linus accepts new features only if they are improving kernel 
in some vital area significantly (for example, Ingo's new scheduler).
If he has a feeling that existing subsystem is adequate, he is unlikely to
take replacements and intrusive enhancements (example: kbuild 2.5).
Something along the lines "it is does not broke _enough_, don't rewrite it".
(that's only IMHO, Linus didn't say it AFAIK)
You'll need to show that "enhanced" printk/evlog is significant improvement 
and is worth the trouble. That won't be easy.
That said, I wish you luck.
