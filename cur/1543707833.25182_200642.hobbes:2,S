Subject: [NFS PATCH 2.6.3] Add write throttling to NFS client
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
The attached patch implements write throttling for the
NFS client.  In the stock client, a streaming write
will hog all the request slots blocking out other
access to the same mount point.  For example, running
a single dd in my NFS home directory completely blocks
my X session until the dd process exits. With the
patch, I have tested running 4 dd's without causing a
completely lock out. Please consider it for inclusion.
Thanks,
Shantanu
