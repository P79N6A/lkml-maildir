It's there due to the way bk works.  I just rebuilt my driver-2.6 tree a
while ago, and Andrew had these changesets in his tree.  Then he pulled
again, and these changes stayed in his local tree.
So, to fix this, Andrew needs to blow away his driver-2.6 tree and clone
it again.  Not too tough :)
thanks,
