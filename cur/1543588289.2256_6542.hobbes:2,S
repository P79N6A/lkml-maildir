Yup, that's right.  That shouldn't be too bad, though, since we
already calculate things by dividing by INODES_PER_BLOCK_GROUP.  So
the fact that the last block of the inode table may have some unused
space shouldn't be a problem.

The "design and implementation of ext2" paper has a pretty good
explanation of the inode table, but of course it assumed a convenient
inode size of 128, and didn't really go into the issues of what might
happen if the inode size were larger, or not a power of two.
So yeah, getting something which explains how things work now that
things have gotten a bit more complicated would be a good thing.
