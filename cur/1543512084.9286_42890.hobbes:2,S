Hi Horst.
Before anybody complains, I will shortly be helping a friend to write
a device driver for Linux, and I thus need to get this sorted out.
There is a strict time limit for the driver project since it is being
done as a final year project for a university degree.

Are you sure of that?
My understanding was that the devfs interface just called the entry
points that get called as a result of accessing the standard node
file. If so, the drivers just have to export the same set of entry
points they would export in the absence of devfs.

Only if devfs uses different entry points to the standard node file.

I saw the post you're referring to, and I found said post very
confusing, so I don't intend to comment thereon.

Certainly needed if devfs is NOT in use, and a good idea even if it is.
Best wishes from Riley.
