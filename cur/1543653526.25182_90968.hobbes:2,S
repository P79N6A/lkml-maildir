I wonder how hard it would be to do this for other files types. It would be 
sort of handy to be able to copy a single file out of the source tree into 
the build tree, and have the build use the copy in the build tree. Example: 
you want to test a one liner in drivers/scsi/sd.c, you could just copy sd.c 
into the build tree, and make the change and test it out. That could be a 
huge space savings. That would help out those of us that are stuck with tiny 
hard drives in our laptops :)

Excellent, I never really thought about it until I read this email, but it 
makes perfect sense(to me anyways).
