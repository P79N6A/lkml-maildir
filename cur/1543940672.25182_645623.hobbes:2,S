Yeah, although the nasty thing about UARTs is that you never know when
DMA really is idle.

I think we can ignore "static". The power savings are minimal compared
to "stop", and you lose the RTC. Might as well power down the whole
chip and save even more power.
But yeah, I imagine we need to use some on-chip SRAM (or some locked
parts of the caches) when transitioning the SDRAM into and out of
self-refresh mode, and when changing timings.

Yes, that looks reasonable. We can also do something in between by
stopping most peripherals and busses. For example, keep one peripheral
bus and one USART running from OSC0 with everything else stopped.

Right. But we could do it in one of those "something in between" states.
With all the other stuff that needs to be done when switching power
modes (running suspend() hooks, etc.) I don't think we need to limit
ourselves to what the "sleep" instruction can do, although the
predefined power states may serve as a nice starting point.

I think we need some chip- or family-specific sleep code that knows how
to enter a given power state. But the specifics about how to wake the
system up must necessarily be board-specific (or even run-time
configurable.)

Right. I guess it's about time we got some proper power management
implemented on avr32...I'll see if I can get started on that soon, but
you're giving me a hard time about my DMA patches :-P
