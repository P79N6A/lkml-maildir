Well, but you also passed it an unsigned long, and the bit number.
Which at least to me implies that they have to set that bit.
Which is totally unnecessary, if they _instead_ decide to set something
else altogether.
For example, the implementation on pte_chain_lock(page) might be something
like this instead:
	static void pte_chain_lock(struct page *page)
	{
		unsigned long hash = hash(page) & PTE_CHAIN_MASK;
		spin_lock(pte_chain[hash]);
	}
	static void pte_chain_unlock(struct page *page)
	{
		unsigned long hash = hash(page) & PTE_CHAIN_MASK;
		spin_unlock(pte_chain[hash]);
	}

bit-locking in general doesn't work. Some architectures can sanely only
lock a byte (or even just a word).
