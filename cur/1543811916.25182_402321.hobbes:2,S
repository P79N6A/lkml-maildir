To trust or not to trust?
I have a 400GB SATA drive: WDC WD4000KD-00N.  With these errors in dmesg 
that have been mentioned throughout the thread, should I trust Linux using 
this drive, or should I remove it/wait until a patch is released to 
address this issue?
Also, in the forums (storagereview.com I believe), it has been noted that 
these drives do NOT work on the Intel ICH5 controller, and this turned out 
to be true, when I put it on the Intel ICH5, the box stalls for 2-3 
minutes and then it does not see the drive.  However, on the Silicon 
Image, Inc. SiI 3112 chipset or Promise SATA/150 TX2 it works okay but it 
has those errors in dmesg.
My question is, performing long and short smart tests, everything is 
physically ok with the drive; however, I probably should not use this 
drive for anything important in Linux, comments?
Justin.
