I don't work at Arcom anymore so I don't have access to the hardware,
but I don't know of a better way off the top of my head how to detect
the presence of the PCA chip.
You are unlikely to have the particular PC/104 card the driver was
written for. If I recall correctly PCA chip itself doesn't do ISA (it
has simple processor bus chip select type arrangement I think) but the
PC/104 card in question has a small CPLD which does the address decoding
for ISA. I guess you are unlikely to find another ISA card which has the
PCA chip on it.
It's possible that you might have an embedded board with the PCA chip
directly on it -- but if you don't then I don't know why you would
enable the driver.
Ian.
