of course: you asked for the two chew's to be treated like that and CFS 
delivered it! :-)
nice -10 means the two chew's will get ~90+% of the CPU time, and all 
other nice 0 tasks will get <10% of CPU time.
in the previous mail i have described the new exponential-scale nice 
levels that CFS introduces. In practice this means that vanilla kernel's 
nice -20 level is roughly equivalent to CFS's nice -6. CFS's nice -10 
would be roughly equivalent to vanilla nice -80 (if it existed).
