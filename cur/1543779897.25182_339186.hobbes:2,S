It shouldn't depend on anything.  mthca_dbg() gets turned into
dev_dbg(), which just does dev_printk(KERN_DEBUG,...).  Perhaps you
have to change your console level to see KERN_DEBUG messages?
Since you're getting to the call to mthca_init_qp_table(), there are
mthca_dbg() calls that you should definitely be getting output from.
