Hi
I have tried the dd again, and when the bus reset itself, the following was in the syslog...
Mar  2 17:26:55 lang-lgb6 kernel: scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
Mar  2 17:26:55 lang-lgb6 kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.

Mar  2 17:26:55 lang-lgb6 kernel: scsi0: device driver called scsi_done() for a
syncronous reset.

I don't know where the PID's came from - the highest pid on my machine at the moment appears to be 250
Any ideas peoples?
