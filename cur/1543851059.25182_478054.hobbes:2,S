The idea is that in general, people aren't going to want to have
separate hierarchies for different resources - they're going to have
the hierarchies be the same for all resources. So in general when they
move a process from one container to another, they're going to want to
move that task to use all the new resources limits/guarantees
simultaneously.
Having completely independent hierarchies makes this more difficult -
you have to manually maintain multiple different hierarchies from
userspace. Suppose a task forks while you're moving it from one
container to another? With the approach that each process is in one
container, and each container is in a set of resource nodes, at least
the child task is either entirely in the new resource limits or
entirely in the old limits - if userspace has to update several
hierarchies at once non-atomically then a freshly forked child could
end up with a mixture of resource nodes.

If we were going to do something like this, hopefully it would look
more like an array of generic container subsystems, rather than a
separate named pointer for each subsystem.

I think we have an overloading of terminology here. By "container" I
just mean "group of processes tracked for resource control and other
purposes". Can we use a term like "virtual server" if you're doing
virtualization? I.e. a virtual server would be a specialization of a
container (effectively analagous to a resource controller)

Do you think that lock contention when modifying hierarchies is
generally going to be an issue - how often do tasks get moved around
in the hierarchy, compared to the other operations going on on the
system?
