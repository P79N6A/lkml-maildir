I would call that an insult to Ingo.

actually modern x86 cpus have hardware NX.

so remark them.

there is lsexec which does this automatic for you based on running

just like PaX, execshield has to disable the vsyscall page.
Exec-Shield actually has the code to 1) move the vsyscall page down in
the address space and 2) randomize it per process, but that is inactive
right now since it needs a bit of help from the VM that isn't provided
anymore since 2.6.8 or so.

it's a balance between compatibility and security. PaX strikes a
somewhat different balance from E-S. E-S goes a long way to avoid
breaking things that posix requires, even if they are silly and rare.
Apps don't DO   PROT_EXEC|PROT_WRITE normally after all.. so this added
"protect" is to a point artifical.
