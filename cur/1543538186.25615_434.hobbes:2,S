good stuff - the original version of my patch (that added support for
dumping %cr registers to show_regs() contained %cr4 unconditionally but
Linus edited it out and only accepted the cr0/cr2/cr3 part - at that time
I only did a simple CONFIG_MXXX compile-time test instead of your big
if() - I didn't think of it at the time :)
