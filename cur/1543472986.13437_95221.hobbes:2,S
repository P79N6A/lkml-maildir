Irrelevant for the original purpose. /dev/null is _guaranteed_ to be there,
/dev/zero almost always is, /dev/full isn't normally found. And for the
purpose of writing scripts/programs the only generally usefull one is
/dev/null.
Please don't forget portability, there are non-linux systems out there.
