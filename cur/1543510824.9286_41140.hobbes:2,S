I saw similar ppp issues on an SMP i686 machine with early 2.2
kernels. I also found that my oopses were getting truncated so I
couldn't really trace them. I switched my ppp service to a non-SMP
machine, and now only occasionally get "unsupported protocol" and
disabled compression, so I just kill -USR2 pppd occasionally.
I've never seen a kernel lockup with 2.2+ppp on a uniprocessor i686,
but I saw them about once every day or 2 under light load on the 2
processor box. This is under various debian flavors, btw, and with
several pppd setups (modem on serial port, telent to shell and run
pppd -passive, and telnet to a port that binds to pppd via inetd).
Not much help, I'm afraid, but just so you know it isn't just you...
