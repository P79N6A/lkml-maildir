I already cc'ed it with the reply to your first mail, but you and your
colleague with the same problem persistently destroyed
the cc list with each reply so I gave up eventually.
No need to send it there again now.

That's likely because the SKGE driver is your only device
that can DMA >4GB.  Typical lowend IDE, sound etc. devices have
already 4GB limits and would be forced through bounce buffering
anyways. The patch just forces that for all devices.
Also it's only a hack and would need to be made VIA specific. But 
I'm trying to get confirmation of the problem from VIA first
because it's pretty drastic action. It's still possible that 
it's only a BIOS bug or somesuch that could be worked around
by setting the right magic bits
We had a similar problem some time ago with a small number
of NF4 boards where it turned out to be a broken BIOS not
programming the bridge correclty.
One contributing factor is likely that the cheap boards are
normally not tested with 4GB RAM, and VIA is normally only found
on cheap boards.
