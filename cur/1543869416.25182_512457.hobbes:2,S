I've a userspace library that does exactly that (GUASI - GPL code avail if 
you want, but no man page written yet). It uses a pool of threads and 
queue requests. I've a bench that crawl through a directory a read files. 
The sync against async performance sucks. You can't do the cachehit 
optimization in userspace. With network stuff could prolly do better 
(since network is more heavily towards async), but still.

Funny, I lazily started doing the same thing last weekend (than I had to 
stop, since real job kicked in ;). I wanted to compare a fully MT trivial 
HTTP server:
http://www.xmailserver.org/thrhttp.c
with one that is event-driven (epoll) and coroutine based. This one will 
only be compared for memory-content delivery, since it has no async vfs 
capabilities. They both support the special "/mem-XXXX" url, that allows 
an HTTP loader to request a given content size.
I also have a epoll+coroutine HTTP loader (that works around httperf 
limitations).
Then, I wanted to compare the above, with one that is epoll+GUASI+coroutine 
based (basically a userpace-only thingy).
I've the code for all the above.
Finally, with one that is epoll+syslet+coroutine based (no code for this 
yet - but it should be a easy port from the GUASI one).
Keep in mind though, that a threadlet solution doing accept/recv/send/sendfile
is becoming blazingly similar to a full MT solution.
I can only immagine the thunders and flames that Larry would throw at us 
for using all those threads :D
