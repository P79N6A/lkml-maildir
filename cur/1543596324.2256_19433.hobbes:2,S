They are the same on an Apple G4 but not necessarily on other PowerPC
machines.  It depends on the PCI host bridge implementation.

Yes, for an Apple G4.

Yes, on an Apple G4.  If you use virt_to_bus then it should work on
all PowerPC machines that I know of (that run 32-bit PPC/Linux).  But
as Dave points out, you should use the interfaces described in
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt instead if at all possible.  It's quite
possible that virt_to_bus will be removed during 2.5.x development.
Paul.
