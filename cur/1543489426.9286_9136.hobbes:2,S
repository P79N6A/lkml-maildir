Once I made some tests with my dual PII 320 MB Ram, 512 MB Swap, to see 
if the smp stuff is stable now (2.0.36pre??), using testprgs with huge 
HEAP consumption, while maltreating with ping -fs 1400. After getting 
some segfaults, but no stalls no more, I decided system is stable now. 
It was, but 6 weeks later, I realized, that cron died that day... 
and with it the cron controlled nightly backup :(
I'am sure, you all know this feeling, when it gives me the creeps...
If I would be the responsible resource controller, I would kick off 
_all_ user processes, before killing _any_ root processes (daemons). 
Your user might be angry and needs klicking the Netscape button again, 
but your sys admins get a better sleep this way.  
Right now, you better not tell them... (&& I will try to forget)
Cheers
