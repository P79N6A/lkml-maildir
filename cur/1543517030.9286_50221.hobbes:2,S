But the IA32 SysPgmMan (Table 9.2 IIRC) says a write to a MESI shared
line merely is forced to memory (which the other CPU is expected to 
snoop).
AFAIK, all aligned writes are atomic.  Now the question is, how does
LOCK affect MESI ?  It ought to force an "invalid", but may not for
performance reasons.
