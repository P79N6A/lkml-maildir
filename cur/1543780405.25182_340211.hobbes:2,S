For what its worth, I'm seeing the same thing on a 2.6.13-rc5 machine
with sata_nv on an x86_64 machine. I can get around it by using noapic.
I initially assumed it was some ACPI or IRQ issue, but my box hangs at
the exact same place, right after announcing the first device.
Try booting with noapic.
