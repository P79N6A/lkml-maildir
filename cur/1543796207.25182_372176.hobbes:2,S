This is about kernel programming - people should care. We have enough crap 
as it is. timer wheel is fast as well, but everything has its limits, 
putting this focus completely to delivery is nonsense. It can't be that 
difficult to put together a decent list of criteria, where to use which 
timer. Both are still _timer_, introducing this timer/timeout thing is 
only confusing.
bye, Roman
