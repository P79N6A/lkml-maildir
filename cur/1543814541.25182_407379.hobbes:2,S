Ok, for those who are interested, old blurb  from the README follows:
"Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
It uses zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.
Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to  
minimise
data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum
of 64K.
Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low  
overhead is
needed."
At the moment it tends to be used for embedded systems, and liveCDs.
