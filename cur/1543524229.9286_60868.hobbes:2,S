There were some request changes in 2.3.41, but it should not make
a difference. My guess is that you are not handling clustered
requests correctly, but that is kind of hard to tell when you
don't show any code.

No.

No, definately not. Are you ending the requests correctly?

You can also use your own request merging functions, ala
blk_init_queue(q, request_fn);
q->merge_fn = your_merge_fn;
q->merge_requests_fn = your_merge_reqeusts_fn;
and just say no to merging, if you like.
