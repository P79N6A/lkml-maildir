I have seen this one as well, and it wasn't a space problem, but some weird
toolchain issue.  I solved it by upgrading my toolchain, because I wanted
the dwarf unwind support and that required a newer toolchain then I had
been using anyway.
My old toolchain was a cross compiler based on:
GNU ld version 2.13.90.0.4 20020814
