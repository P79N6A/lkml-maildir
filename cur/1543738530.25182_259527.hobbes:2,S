And DMA needs to be stopped, or it is "bye bye data" situation.

Does sparse now have typechecking on enums? Solution that was in -mm
was basically "put enums there so drivers can't be confused" + "signal
global state out-of-band in global variable". It was not too nice, but
it certainly was working.
