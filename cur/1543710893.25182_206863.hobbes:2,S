IPMI_SMB still causes the following compile error:
<--  snip  -->
...
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x135a0b): In function `smbus_client_read_block_data':
: undefined reference to `i2c_set_spin_delay'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x135bad): In function `smbus_client_write_block_data':
: undefined reference to `i2c_set_spin_delay'
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x13629f): In function `set_run_to_completion':
: undefined reference to `i2c_set_spin_delay'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
Until this issue is sorted out, please either drop ipmi-updates-3.patch
or remove the SMBus IPMI driver from this patch.
