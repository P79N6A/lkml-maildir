kvm kernel code is now developed using git.  This was done for two reasons:
- with the paravirtualization work, we have code in the kernel beyond 
drivers/kvm/.  Subversion is not quite up to hosting an entire kernel 
tree efficiently.
- people have expressed interest in maintaining long-term branches of 
kvm.  This is something that git is quite good at, while with subversion 
this requires an account on our systems.
You can pull from my repository by issuing the command
  git pull git://kvm.qumranet.com/home/avi/kvm/linux-2.6
Please do not clone from this URL.  Instead, clone from git.kernel.org 
so that you clog their pipes instead of mine.  Then issue the pull 
command as described above.
The module source files have been removed from the subversion tree.  To 
compile an external module, first copy the files from a Linux tree:
  make LINUX=/path/to/linux/tree/that/has/pulled/from/the/kvm/repo sync
  make
-- 
error compiling committee.c: too many arguments to function
