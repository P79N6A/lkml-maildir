Hard to know until you try it: my fear may prove groundless,
or experience may discourage you from the exercise completely.
Quick guess is that what you'd really want in the end is not a
CONFIG option or /proc tunable, but some mark in an ELF section
for what behaviour that particular executable wants.
I'm reluctant to call wanting a large virtual address space buggy;
but expecting contiguous ascending mmaps (without MAP_FIXED) is buggy.
