Maybe you can run it off from gdb? Or `strace` it to a file? Usually
these things are caused by invalid 'C' runtime libraries, either
corrupt, "installed by just making a sim-link to something that
was presumed to be close to what the application was compiled with",
or an error in mem-mapping.
Another very-real possibility is that somebody used floating-point
within the kernel thus corrupting  the `seti` FPU state. You can
check this out by making a program that does lots of FP calculations,
perhaps the sine of a large number of values. You put the results
into one array. Then you do the exact same thing with the results
put into another array.  Then just `memcmp` the arrays! You run
this in a loop for an hour. If the kernel is mucking with your FPU,
it will certainly show.

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
