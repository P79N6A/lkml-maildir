Hi,
The route man page gives "route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0"
as the syntax to add a multicast route to the kernel. I remember that this
was needed for the 2.2 kernels (I may be mistaken). Multicasting seems to
work fine on the 2.4 kernels even without this explicit route. Is it still
needed?
