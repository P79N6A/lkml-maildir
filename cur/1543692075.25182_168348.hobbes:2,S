Couple of questions:
- Why does it use hard-coded values? Different people prefer different 
  settings.
- Are userspace drivers supposed to use BTN_TOUCH event to detect whether 
  the pad is touched or ABS_PRESSURE? If ABS_PRESSURE then BTN_TOUCH is
  unneeded; otherwise it's not configurable.
- Introducing BTN_TOUCH as far as I can seen does nothing to prevent joydev
  grabbing either Synaptics or touchscreens... Is there a patch missing?
  Anyway, I still thing that joydev claims are too broad. Next time you add 
  a non-joystick device you will need to re-examine joydev and it should be
  other way around - if you add a joystick you need to make sure that joydev
  grabs it. This way you will catch most problems right away.
BTW, any chance on including pass-through patches? Do you want me to re-diff 
them?
