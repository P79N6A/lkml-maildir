No, there are many ways that root can break out of chroot(2).  I maintain
some patches[1] against 2.2 (and grsecurity[2] has ported most of them to
2.4) which aim to try to make it harder for root to break out of chroot(2),
but I won't say I've got them all--in fact I'll say I'm sure I *don't* have
them all, and I'd like to hear suggestions for more.  Here are some things
to worry about:
-chroot(2)'ing with an open directory fd
-prevent chroot(2) by a process already chrooted ("double-chroot")
-block mount(2) attempts inside chroot ("chroot(../..)" ...)
-block mknod of char or block devices inside chroot ("mknod /dev/hda",
   "mknod /dev/kmem")
-block chmod +s by a chrooted process
-block ptrace(2) by a chrooted process of processes outside the jail
-block most signals by a chrooted process to processes outside the jail
-block setting capabilities (capset) by a chrooted process of processes 
   outside the jail
-drop "dangerous" capabilities when chroot(2)'ing.  (See the patch, but
   basically, various *_ADMIN, *RAW*, etc to block ioctl, sysctl for
   dangerous things.)
One area I have not looked at sufficiently is sysv IPC (shared memory,
semaphores...).  It's quite possible that a chrooted process can tamper
with shared memory segments that other, outside-chroot processes are using
(especially if some app is designed to use them to communicate across the
chroot boundary; I don't know of any but they could exist) and use that
vector to attack and try to subvert the other, non-chrooted process(es).
I'd appreciate any suggestions in addition to the above, and/or holes poked
in the implementation (which I'm sure isn't the best...).
