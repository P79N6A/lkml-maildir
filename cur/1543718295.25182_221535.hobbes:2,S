Hi , 
I am working with the Linux networking source code for
the first time. 
I am working with the file tcp.c in
/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4 . Everytime I make a small
change, I recompile the kernel. Is there any way to
get the changes in tcp.c (or any file in /ipv4 , for
that matter) reflected without kernel re-compiling, so
that it saves time?
Sai
