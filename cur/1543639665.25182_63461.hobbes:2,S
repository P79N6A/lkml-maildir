I ran oldconfig, but I probably just said, 'USB I have all the drivers
I need, NO', but thanks, I figured out that option when I read the USB
mailing list.
Are there alternate ways of getting data to the /dev/usb/mice type
devices CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV?  (Major 13, Minor 63), or shouldn't an
open to that device fail with no device if CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT isn't
enabled?
