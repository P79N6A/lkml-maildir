If you don't have a module, you can not use module parameters. However, it 
might even be simpler...
You just put your parameters (strings to parse) on the kernel command-line 
and you put code in your driver to interpret them.
You want to look at "saved_command_line." It is a string as:
extern char saved_command_line[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE];
You need to parse ASCII text yourself, in your driver, but it's trivial. 
Look at .../arch/i386/kernel/setup.c parse_cmdline_early().
I don't see anywhere in the kernel that it gets overwritten so it should be 
good to use.
