Did you count the number of devices that tree supports?
You'll loose the support of all new laptops and mobos sold in the last
year :)
Honestly, I'm not fully against changing the current code base (or
crap, whatever, any childish name).  There are indeed many misdesigns.
But, replacing with the above is no option, IMO.  The OSS have also
many misdesigns, so the same argument would start again.  One should
learn something from history...
Anyway, if it's going to be more constructive, I'm willing to join in.
