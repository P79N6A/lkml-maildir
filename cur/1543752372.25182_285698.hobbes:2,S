As already said, you need to reboot.
To fix this in the future, export a /proc entry that when written to 
causes your module to properly clean everything up and prevent anyone 
from getting new accesses.  This then allows you to remove the module 
cleanly.  Note that it may not be possible to cleanly deregister, 
depending on what your module is doing.
