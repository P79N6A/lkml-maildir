Oh I will. The "more smooth" swap code I am testing
right now concentrates on swapping from processes
that have been sleeping for longer than 
cache size / inactive_target
seconds. I think this might actually help with the
performance of low-memory systems, but I need to
test this a bit before I know for sure ;)
