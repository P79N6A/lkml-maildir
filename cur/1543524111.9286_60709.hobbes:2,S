Correction.  klogd tried to do its own oops conversion on the call
trace and klogd got it wrong.  Not only did klogd get it wrong but it
removes information that ksymoops needs to do the debugging.  I sent a
patch[1] to the sysklogd maintainer months ago but the problem
persists.

Get a newer modutils[2] and all module symbols will be available for
oops debugging.  No need to run insmod -m or hack the symbol table by
hand.
