While I worked on this tracer, I had to base the thing against tracing/kmemtrace
because I needed the kmemtrace bits.
But I saw that this topic was a bit out of sync against tip/master, some updates from
Steven were not merged. But I didn't wonder, thinking that Ingo would resolve the
conflicts. But it seems there were some lost stuffs :-)
I'm checking it and will send a patch to solve the rest...
