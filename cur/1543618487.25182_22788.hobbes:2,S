2.2.19 from slack bare.i also froze today (during a 2.4.17 compile).  I added the mem=nopentium a couple days ago and there was no difference.  Win2K worked successfully for the 3rd day in a row. :-(
after the freezes I almost always have to run e2fsck manually on the partition with the sources -- I assume thats because its such a hard freeze
