Yes, this is sort of what I have deemed a 'last resort' though, mostly
because releasing the semaphore cannot be done after the thread exits,
only before.. so I will still have a chance of executing code in memory
that was deallocated when the module was unloaded.
It is like acting on the rising edge rather than the falling edge.
But if i can't find anything else (and nobody else comes up with a better
suggestion) I'll do it this way - having the machine hang is a
surprisingly large motivator for taking a less-than-perfect approach
that is quicker :)
