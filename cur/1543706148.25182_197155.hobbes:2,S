Indeed this is a mistake.
Everything was still working as expected because i_attrs_to_sd_attrs cannot
change anything these days, since the only way to change inode attributes is
through special ioctl, that directly assigns passed flags value to i_attrs
field of reiserfs specific part of inode.
For the sakr of correctness and also in case there would be another path
to change file attrubutes besides the ioctl, this patch below is needed
for both 2.4 and 2.6
Thank you very much.
Bye,
    Oleg
