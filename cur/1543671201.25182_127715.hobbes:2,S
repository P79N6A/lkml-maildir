I never intended to call any function in dmi_scan from outside. I know
this stuff is __init, and what would be the point in rescanning the same
table again anyway? No, what I want is to make dmi_ident, which is the
array containing the results of the dmi scan, to be available to
everyone. Take a look at the previously sent patch, I think it's quite
straightforward.
I'm not sure I understand well what you mean with "register multible DMI
tables", so it's probably not what I want ;)
Let me know if I really missed something.
