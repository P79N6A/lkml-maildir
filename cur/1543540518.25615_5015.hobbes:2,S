Yup, we know why FreeBSD VM works and what its weak points
could be. We've also had some help from SGI and Sequent/IBM
people as to what the scalability problems of our new VM
design could be.
The new VM will be heavily based on FreeBSD VM, which we
know works, with some small tweaks where we've tried to
come up with scenarios where they'd break (and we failed,
so we'll try those tweaks).
regards,
Rik
