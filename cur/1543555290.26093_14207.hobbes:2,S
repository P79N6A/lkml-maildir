Yes. I just enabled the nmi watchdog to try to debug the problem. It did 
not change anything.
About the 8254, the kernel log contains :
Nov 20 17:15:15 pc8-118 kernel: MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer 
				not connected to IO-AP
IC
Nov 20 17:15:15 pc8-118 kernel: ...trying to set up timer (IRQ0)
						 through the 8259A ...  
Nov 20 17:15:15 pc8-118 kernel: ..... (found pin 0) ...works.
But this does not seem to annoy the kernel.
Is there anyway to restore the 8254 to a valid state without rebooting ?
