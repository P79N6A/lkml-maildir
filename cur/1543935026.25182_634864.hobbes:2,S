The problem is that mailing lists are far too often equivalent to 
/dev/null for many bug reports.
Tracking e.g. helps with not missing regressions and getting more of 
them fixed.
And another of the advantages of using Bugzilla is that it gives us 
numbers how bad we are in terms of introducing regressions and having 
unfixed bugs, so developers are no longer able to tell we didn't have a 
problem in this area...

Bugzilla for tracking and mailing lists for discussing are not mutually 
exclusive.
What about asking the Bugzilla admins to set the default owner of new 
SCSI bugs to linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org?
This way all SCSI bugs submitted in Bugzilla will automatically be 
forwarded to the linux-scsi mailing list.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
