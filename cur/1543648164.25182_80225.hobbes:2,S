In the case of Advanced TCA, an IPMI message is sent to the CPU blade 
indicating the hotswap button is pressed on the front panel of a disk 
blade.  The hotswap manager software unmaps the GA address, removes the 
device from the linux kernel via the scsi-hotswap-main stuff, and sends 
another IPMI message to the disk node telling it to light its "blue 
led".  The user removes the disk.  Insertion is easier.
In this case, the hotswap button on the front panel is used to indicate 
a hotswap event.  There is talk of making the removal of the board 
indicate a hotswap event (surprise extraction) because the technicians 
don't wait for the blue led to remove the boards occasionally and the 
system should be able to handle this use case.

In the case of SAFTE, a SCSI processor (ASIC) is polled by some polling 
interval about the state of the SAFTE (SCSI) backplane.  When the state 
changes, software generates a hotswap event and removes the device.
