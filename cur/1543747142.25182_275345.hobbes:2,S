Subject: Potential race condition in SMP version of 2.6.9?

Hi,
I'm having severe problems getting the SMP version of 2.6.9 up
and running. I'm using a stock-version of FC2 without
modificiation bar the kernel and the kudzu modification / removal
as suggested in linux.redhat.install on 2004-9-25/26 when facing
similar problems.
The problem manifests during the level 5 boot phase when certain scripts 
in /etc/rc5.d are executed, more precisely the S90xfs and S96readahead
scripts. I first observed the problem when booting the SMP version
of the kernel (configuration: all experimental features switched off,
SMP enabled with 2 CPUs and hyperthreading scheduler support enabled).
The font server apparently never returns and thus the init sequence
seems to hang. So I moved the execution of the script to S98xfs just
to check. Now S96readahead stalls with the same symptoms and
boot sequence hangs again. Trying any of the sys-rq features
(although enabled in the kernel config) to get some initial debug info
does not work. I'm using a single-CPU Pentium 4 system with
ACPI and HT enabled in the BIOS (see copy of /proc/cpuinfo below).
The initialisation sequence works perfectly well when using the
kernel that came with FC2 or 2.6.9 without SMP support. Thus,
I'm suspecting a race condiition / deadlock within the kernel.
Any thoughts on this or pointers to hints? I'd be glad to
provide any additional information (strace dumps, etc.) as required.
