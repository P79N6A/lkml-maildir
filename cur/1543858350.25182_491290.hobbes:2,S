there's another bug as well: in schedule() resched_cpu() is called with 
the current runqueue held in two places, which is deadlock potential. 
The easiest fix for this is to use trylock - find the patch for that. 
This is a hint only anyway - and if a CPU is idle its runqueue will be 
lockable. (fixing it via double-locking is easy in the first call site, 
but the second one looks harder)
