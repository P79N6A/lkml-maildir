Somehow (haven't found out why it suddenly got compiled, no .config
changes) this showed up in the list of warnings in 2.6.23-rc9 compared
to -rc8 on one of my m68k builds:
| drivers/net/wireless/libertas/cmd.c:189: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type
| drivers/net/wireless/libertas/cmd.c:195: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type
The offending lines are:
| wep->keytype[i] = cpu_to_le16(cmd_type_wep_40_bit);
| wep->keytype[i] = cpu_to_le16(cmd_type_wep_104_bit);
I.e. it tries to store 0x0100 resp. 0x0200 into keytype[i], which is is u8.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
