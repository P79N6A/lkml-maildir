I've noticed a wierd thing with 2.6.0-test7-mm1; the disk cache grows
wildly. I'm just sitting in X (Gnome 2.4) with maybe a dozen temrinals
open, mozilla and a few bits, and when runnign "grep blah *" in a
directory with maybe a few hundred megs of data in it, the grep
progress dies with memory exhaustion, and using top to view memory
consuption, it seems that the disk cache grows uncontrollably. 
My machine has 768Mb of RAM and the disk cache greows from ~200Mb to
~600Mb, while X goes very sluggish and then the grep dies.
.config:
[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
dmesg:
[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
(And yes, this happens both with and without the VMware modules)
mvh,
A
