Yes, I would never set PG_Uptodate without having sane page contents 
first.
In fact all the metadata writing code in NTFS actually clears PG_Uptodate 
on a locked page because it mangles the page contents, writes them out, 
and then demangles them again, before finally setting PG_Uptodate again 
to protect against read_cache_page() getting hold of pages with i/o in 
flight which for NTFS metadata would cause corruption.

Thanks.  I always have a flush_dcache_page(page) between the memset() and 
the SetPageUptodate() so I don't need the barrier, right?  Or does the 
flush_dcache_page() not imply ordering?  (I naively thought it did...)
