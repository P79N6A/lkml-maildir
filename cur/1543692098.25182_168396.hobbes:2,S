What tools can I use to track a error with remap_page_range?
I am working on a driver that remaps a 64M chunk from a
PCI card. I have confirmed that the driver executes
remap_page_range(42133000,f0000000,400000,27)
vma->Flags = 840fb
in the driver mmap. This is driven from my apps mmap
command where I pass NULL for the address.
While the application has the driver open
/proc/[ps]/maps shows the following
42133000-46133000 rw-s 000000
I have also checked /proc/iomem and found
f0000000-f3ffffff
listed on the PCI card I am working on
MY problem is a single write to 42133000 in the application
locks the system and is appearing to try and write to the
vga cards memory (or the crash is affecting the vga screen mem).
What other tools can I use to check/trace this remapping?
Redhat9.0 (2.4.20-6smp) (mem=768 passed to stay under 1G)
PCI card uses Xilinx PCI core
Thanks
