This is a known issue (at least for me :).  When the difference
between 2 vid and/or 2 fid are too big, that hang.
For now, as a quick (and mostly dirty though) solution is to go
with the userspace governor only and to go to the lowest frequency with
one or two step in-between.
I'm also wondering if those athlons have the same kind of stuff than
the opteron (Dave)?
