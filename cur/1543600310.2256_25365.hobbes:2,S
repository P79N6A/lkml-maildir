Is /sbin/init executable ?
Check it with ls:
ls -l /sbin/init should get you
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root        26876 Jun 21 20:58 /sbin/init
Is it the correct file ?
Compare it against another maschine or copy it from there (same
Distribution, save the old file)
Try giving the Kernel a parameter at bootime: at the LILO-Prompt, press
<tab>, then enter the imagename followed by the parameter, e.g. "linux
init=/bin/bash"
The kernel should boot up and give you a single (root-) shell.
Uses the kernel the right root-device ?
If not, give it to him at boottime like the init=Stuff: "root=/dev/hda1"
says the kernel to mount /dev/hda1 as rootdevice ("/") and search on
this device for "init".
Solong..
Frank.

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
