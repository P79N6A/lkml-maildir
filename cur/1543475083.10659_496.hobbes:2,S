OK all, problem solved - the reason why I wasn't experiencing the same
problem is because it was sensitive to screen length - I normally run
with an 80x50 text screen - and only occurs when one scrolled a screen
BEFORE pressing the space bar. Since none of the existing menus are
long enough for this situation to occur on a 50 line screen, I was
unable to replicate it...
Best wishes from Riley.
