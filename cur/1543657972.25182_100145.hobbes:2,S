That stinks...it don't work in .54 and I'd likem to have my automounter
functioning again. Oh well it *is* 2.5.

Also for some reason I always have to do a "touch /fastboot" and boot in
rw mode to boot the kernel. The kernel fails on remouting fs in r-w mode.
X also don't work saying /dev/agpgart don't exist even though it does and
I saw it. agpgart module is loaded..maybe it would work as built into the
kernel? .config attached.
