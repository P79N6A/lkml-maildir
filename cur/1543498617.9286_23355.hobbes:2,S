	Not true at all...
	You merely have to store hashes at the server side and use a strong
challenge response system for the client to prove that it knows the hashes
without revealing them.  In theory, if you broke into the server and stole
the hashes, you could create a fake client who could then fake out the
server, but you already own the server from having broken into it.  You do
not have to store passwords in clear, or in any reversible format anywhere.

	Then put up with it crapping out and don't complain when bugs
in Windows 95 cause it to go brain damaged.  You chose to use it, for
whatever reason, so you put up with its flaws and don't blaim others...
