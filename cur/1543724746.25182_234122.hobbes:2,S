Thanks Jeff,
Clearly there is something wrong. I can't access the device using 
/dev/sda .. /dev/sdh. I have scsi support as modules (sd_mod, scsi_mod) 
and have enabled CONFIG_SCSI_SATA. /proc/scsi/scsi reports no adaptors 
present.
Also why do I get the mass of errors on /dev/hdg at boot time?
Thanks.
