Or rather..   lattest thing to raise its ugly head is
    dorkslayers.com
which in itself, and in all its subdomains ("*.dorkslayers.com")
points to Verisign's web service.    (Properly functioning lookup
routines would ignore A-records with wrong kind values, and lacking
TXT entries, but obviously I see cases where still present lookups
do use faulty premisses.)
None of the "free service" DNS BLs appear to have very long life-times.
The technology has some usefull ideas behind it, but alas once some
free service becomes popular, it is prone to overload, receive litigation
threats ("wonderfull" usa..) and fold over.  Often the folding is
accompanied with a period of poisoned datasets.
