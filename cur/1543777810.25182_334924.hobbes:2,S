There are not, but I've seen various boxes behave the way you describe
with IDE DMA enabled as IDE DMA uses a lot of the PCI bandwidth. Usually
it indicates a hardware bug and as far as ICH errata are concerned I
know of none relevant. You can check however as Intel put most chipset
errata docs on their website.
