While there are, historically 1Mb/s has allways been 1.000.000. The
misconception about it not being 1.000.000 is cause people associate it
with bytes. Though it's not because bits make up bytes that bits are
naturally forced to "live" on byte boundaries. As clock pulse generators
generally don't really live on byte boundaries either there was never a
real reason to make 1Mb/s related to bytes (or to make 1Kb/s related to
bytes). When referring to byte-bound data transfer speed you can stick to
xB/s instead of xb/s.
As an example, your Serial port doesn't exactly think of bits in
groups of 1024 either.
So in general your best bet is to see 1Kb/s as 1.000 bits per second and
1Mb/s as 1000Kb/s or 1.000.000b/s. As most technologies will stick to
that. Though off course through the ages a lot of things have been altered
it and therefor have added to the confusion.
