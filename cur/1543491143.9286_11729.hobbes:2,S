Hi,
just wanted to let you all know i fixed the problem. What happened was it
tried to bind port 6667 twice. First it read the conf file, and binded 6667
as one of the ports, then at the end, it again tried to bind 6667 as the
hardcoded default port in the binary. Didnt work. I wonder why it didnt give
any probs on 2.0.xx though
Anyway, thanks
