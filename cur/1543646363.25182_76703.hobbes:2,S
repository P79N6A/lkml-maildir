   The clause is specifically designed to target those companies which 
   produce or sell commercial SCM systems.  That's why we explicitly 
   left out "distribute".  The open source developers have nothing to
   worry about.
I don't have any problems with what you're trying to achieve, but my
fear is that it doesn't even do that.
Nothing in your license changes stops someone from dark-room
duplicating bitkeeper.  Just as clone Intel processors are sold
quite legally today.  Intel lost their attempts to stop that and
my current guess is that you have a smaller legal representation
than Intel has :-)
