Kino still uses the legacy raw1394 iso interface for capture by default; 
however, it can also still use dv1394. I will accellerate the adoption of the 
new raw1394 interface since I have already done this for dvgrab 2.0. 
Cinelerra supports libiec61883 now.
Unfortunately, gstreamer still uses legacy raw1394 iso interface, but I can 
nag someone at Fluendo. I think another high profile app that might be 
affected is GnomeMeeting/Ekiga, but I have not kept close track of it.
Also, I have not released a version of libraw1394 that contains the 
deprecation warnings, but I can do so this weekend. And then another release 
when the removed kernel interfaces are released that removes the functions.
