I had the following situations:
NFS server:
linux 2.2.19
NFS Client:
linux 2.4.[32]ac[...],
linux 2.4.4ac[1-...]
[1-10] have been working fine. Beginning with ac11, I got the problems I 
wrote. During this time, I never used any knfsd-patch.
The following is the combination, which seems to be working fine:
NFS Server:
linux 2.2.19 with knfsd-patch or linux 2.4.5 with the following knfsd-Patch 
from Gergely Tamas <dice@mfa.kfki.hu> (I got it from the mailinglist of 
reiser) (there is no patch for ac6):

I patched the original 2.4.5-sources.

I tested the following combination:
Server
2.2.19 without knfsd-Patch
Client
2.4.5ac6 without knfsd-Patch but ide=nodma
Result:
IO-Errors as I wrote in my initial posting.
