Nope, Arjan's patch (and my incremental) touch hugetlb_zero_setup,
which only seems to be called from ipc/shm.c
Normal hugetlb file creation (through the filesystem) isn't touched
by these patches.

The patch only touches "anonymous" hugetlb files, ie. the ones
created through ipc/shm.c.  I'm not sure why you claim that the
others would be affected by this patch...
