I am using the MDS 810 STB as provided by MDS
(
http://www.mds.com/products/product.asp?prod=MDS-810
). The kernel and
entire environment (except my driver) was set up by MDS. uname output is
as follows.
 # uname -a
Linux 10.41.13.87 2.6.19PNX8550 #1 Wed Nov 21 14:55:52 EST 2007 mips
unknown
If I can provide additional information for you I'd be happy to help.
Thanks,
Jon
