So Linus is right. His main argument is about people selection. Keep
the ones who don't want to do it the hard way out of the door.
You're just saying that his strategy is succeeding.
Let me ask: if you want to learn how the kernel works, and you think you
need a debugger, why don't you apply the patches yourself? What Linus does
with his own tree has little impact on you. You won't buy Linus with the
'learning' argument, I think.
I don't think Linus' main point is "do I the hard way or don't". The point
is that "doing it with a debugger is not the easy way". It seems to be
easier but you don't get the Knowledge. So in the end it's 'the right way'
vs. 'the wrong way'. not 'hard' vs. 'easy'.  In this, I must say I agree
with him. I'd also add that source code is (should be) a language to
express ideas (at the same time to implement them).  With a well written
source, you don't need a debugger at all to understand 'how it works'.
And if you find you need it, we've quite a problem with the source
in the beginning. Source code should be more human readable than debugger
output, *expecially* for beginners. In this Linus is doing a great job.
My points againts Linus' arguments:
1) you should give people freedom to do what they do. If they want to spend
   thier time with a debugger let them do. This 'social engineering' thing
   is crap. You don't make people better by filtering them.
2) apply tight filters on what people produce (patches, features) not on
   how they produce. If Linus is right (and in the end I believe it),
   'debugger people' will produce low quality patches (the ones that fix
   the syntoms not the problems), and those patches won't be blessed
   by Linus. I think Alan made the point that those patches sometimes
   may be useful to others who are looking for the real problems.
Also, Jeff, if you're reading this, go on with your (better) debugger.
The whole point of releasing something under GPL is the feedback you
get for free, which sometimes happens to be high quality feedback, 
contributions, bug-fixes, an so on. You get a better product, in the end,
and since you find it useful to you, in primis, it makes *your* life
easier.
