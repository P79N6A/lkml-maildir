does the ping phenomenon go away if you chrt both the networking IRQ
thread and both ksoftirqd's to above the RT task's priority? (this
doesnt solve the problem though - that task has RT priority for a reason
and on an SMP box the kernel should be able to schedule work without
getting into this starvation scenario.)
