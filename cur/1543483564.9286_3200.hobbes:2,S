Hercules isn´t MDA in some cases. 
An Hercules or MDA can be detected by looking on the 7th bit of the
status register on port 0x3BA. MDA doesn´t use this bit, Hercules
does. On the vertical Retrace Hercules set this to ´0´
(Source (don´t laugh!!): Bomanns, "Das große GW-BASIC Buch" 1991, DATA
BECKER) 
On a MDA you cannot use graphic-modes, on Hercules you can (720x348, 2
colors). 
I think, more than 25 lines is a special graphics mode, so MDA cannot
show it.
Does anyone know more about it?
