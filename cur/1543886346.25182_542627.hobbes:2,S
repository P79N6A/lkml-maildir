Right. The patch is fine. What I said when I commented on it was an
ACK, that's not being debated.
I just thought that Acked-by: was considered a lot more formal and was
surprised to see that line with my name on the patch. But I've since
checked up on that assumption and I can't find anything that states
that it is considered as formal as I thought it was, so the mistake is
all mine and what you did is fine.
If Acked-by: should be made more formal or not is a different discussion.
