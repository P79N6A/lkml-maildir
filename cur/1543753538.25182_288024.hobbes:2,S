It's a normal UP athlon 1ghz, it should be quite widespread hardware.
I know at least another system that had the problem of system time going
in the future with 2.6 at the same rate of mine. Still it could be an
hardware issue after all if nobody else can reproduce it. At HZ=100 the
system time is again perfectly accurate like in 2.4, so probably at least
the PIT is ok.
