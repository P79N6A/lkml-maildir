Subject: redundant code in 2.3.8 buffer.c

since we no longer have any concept of temporary, for-IO-only buffer_heads,
reuse_list, free_async_buffers() and recover_reusable_buffer_heads() become
redundant. recover...() is a nop, and it's use in create_buffers before
scheduling is pointless. create_buffers should probably wakeup bdflush and
schedule after setting policy to SCHED_YIELD.
