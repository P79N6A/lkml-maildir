The IDE driver, file ide-probe.c currently contains this test do prevent
hard drives and IDE-flash devices (ex CompactFlash) from co-existing on the
same IDE controller. 
        /*
         * Prevent long system lockup probing later for non-existant
         * slave drive if the hwif is actually a flash memory card of some
variety:
         */
        if (drive_is_flashcard(drive)) {
                ide_drive_t *mate =
&HWIF(drive)->drives[1^drive->select.b.unit];
                if (!mate->ata_flash) {
                        mate->present = 0;
                        mate->noprobe = 1;
                }
        }
This test's assumption that a spinning hard drive cannot coexist on the same
controller as an IDE-flash device is incorrect.  I have a working setup with
such a configuration.  I don't think that the IDE subsystem should punish
everyone because _some_ hardware cannot tolerate this configuration.
One solution may be to remove this test from the IDE subsystem and force
users with buggy hardware to explicitly  disable probing for a second
device.  I think the parameters hdx=none or hdx=noprobe should work for
them.
