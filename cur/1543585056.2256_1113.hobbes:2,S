Umm... Chris, I really don't think that panic() (or BUG(), for that matter)
is an appropriate reaction to IO errors. They are expected events, after
all...
ObReiserfs_panic: what the hell is that ->s_lock bit about? panic() _never_
tries to do any block IO. It looks like a rudiment of something that hadn't
been there for 5 years, if not longer. The same goes for ext2_panic() and
ufs_panic(), BTW... I would suggest crapectomey here.
							Cheers,
								Al
