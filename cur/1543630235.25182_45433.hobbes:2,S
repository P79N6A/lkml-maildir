Hej Kasper,
Sure you were not running the shell as root ?  :)
The redirection is handled by your shell, mount doesn't have anything to do
with the '>filename' part.
Actually, the more fun test is to
  mount > /etc/passwd
or
  mount > /dev/hda
But this won't work either, unless your shell (and therefore you as a user,
suid programs or not) have the permissions as required.
In short: I don't think you are seeing what you think you are seeing  ;)
