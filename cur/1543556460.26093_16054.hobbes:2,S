Because the trace is printed after the code line, it is treated as part
of the next oops, confusing.  Even more of a problem, the trace
addresses only print the low word of the address, that should really be
Trace: fffffc0000323658 fffffc0000323600 
If somebody would change the Alpha oops text to print the registers,
the trace (with full addresses) and original code, in that order, then
ksymoops would have no problem.  I do not want to change ksymoops
because that might affect processing of logs for other architectures.
IMNSHO we need to be more consistent in the way that we print oops
logs, Alpha is quite different from the other architectures.
In the meantime, if you manually edit the oops log to this layout then
you will get a much better listing.

That last line may be incomplete, it is probably missing the failing
instruction.  To build a correct Code: line, extract the hex values for
the code bytes, enclose the failing instruction in < >, without the
leading '*'.
