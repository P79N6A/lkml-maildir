Press the "enter" button after typing "make".  ;)

Yes.

There's certainly a lot to be said for having things
just work the first time when you're making such a big
transition in tools.  On the other hand, at some point
the training wheels need to come off!

Be careful there.  Remember that the driver model is predicated
on knowing the devices first, and *then* matching drivers.  I
expect you *will* see problems if you get people thinking system
config comes from a "which driver" selection rather than "here's
the exact hardware that's available".  Maybe configfs should be
used for device config.

I'm more used to clock rates less than 1/3 that much.  :)
