doing normal desktop things (gnome, jboss, mozilla, apt-get updates,
etc) i've noticed audio skips on occassion that i had not seen in
kernels previous to 2.5.65.
i'm not going to complain though, because mozilla seems to start
quicker, and my jboss start time has dropped from 1m:10s average to
40s.  very cool!
