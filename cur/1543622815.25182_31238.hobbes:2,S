In that sense, the GPL isn't free either.
You get to use software published under the GPL in
exchange for publishing your additions and changes
to that software under the GPL as well.
If I wanted proprietary people to be able to use my
code without giving anything back to me I'd choose
the BSD license instead of the GPL.
