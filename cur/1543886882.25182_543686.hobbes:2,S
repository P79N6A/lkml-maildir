Subject: [PATCH] pcmcia: ppc64 needs 64-bit ioaddr_t

ppc64 really needs ioaddr_t to be 64-bit, since I/O addresses really
are MMIO addresses, and remapped to a high range.
While the type is exported to userspace, there hasn't been any platforms
with PCMCIA on 64-bit powerpc until now, so changing it won't regress
any existing users.
