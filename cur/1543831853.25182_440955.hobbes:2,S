I think we shall have msi_ops hanging off struct pci_bus.
That way, MSI support can be "installed" off a given bus and can be
handled differently when necessary. On many platforms, the MSI handling
will actually be different from one bus to the next (the Apple G5 comes
to mind with its PCIe off the northbridge on one side and it's HT<->PCIe
tunnels on the other, using different mecanisms for MSIs, but there are
or will be others).
