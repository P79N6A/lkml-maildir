Alan ,
But this is allowed now and for me, after removing CONFIG_SATA_INTEL_COMBINED option
some other options combos may be illegal and removing it broke a lot working setups.
On <2.6.22 you got on your SATA/PATA controller with CONFIG_IDE=y , ATA=y ( ATA_X=y and even BLK_DEV_X=y) the
SATA disk as SATA and PATA one as IDE now you get the SATA disk as 'IDE' too which gives you almost 3-4MB/s speed.
Is such a config legall for you for an SATA/IDE combo controller in >=2.6.22 ?
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_SATA=n
CONFIG_IDE=y
ATA=y
BLK_DEV_PIIX=y(or m doesn't matter )
ATA_PIIX=y
IMO after removing CONFIG_SATA_INTEL_COMBINED you guys introduced an real conflict with the IDE subsystem.
The only way to get libata working with such a config is to boot ideX=noprobe.

Gabriel
