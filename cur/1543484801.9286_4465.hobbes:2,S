May be we could have two limits, the current 'soft' limit, and a 'hardish' limit
at which we start syncing inodes, a la Andrea's patch. There would still never
be a hard limit, as we will always allocate memory for a fresh inode if there
are no unused or syncable inodes. Is it possible to wake up the update daemon to
starting the syncing asynchronously, rather than syncing inodes inline as
Andrea's latest patch does?
Cheers,
Steve
