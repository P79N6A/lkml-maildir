This is 2.6.18-rc3 on sparc64 but posting on LKML since the warning 
cones from generic code (although guarded by
#ifdef TIF_RESTORE_SIGMASK).
   CC      fs/compat.o
fs/compat.c: In function 'compat_sys_pselect7':
fs/compat.c:1869: warning: ignoring return value of 'copy_to_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
I would just return EFAULT there when copy_to_user returns nonzero value 
but there is some signal mask thing going on that someone more familiar 
with the code should look.
