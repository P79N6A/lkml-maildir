What does this variable stand for? I saw that it was used in
....../drivers/ide/ide-probe.c
There if that macro is defined, probe_hwif() and hwif_init() are called
seperately
and if it is not defined a single function call to probe_hwif_init()
goes.
So that does this HWIF_PROBE_CLASSIC_METHOD stand for? I saw a comment
saying "Probe for drives in the usual way.. CMOS/BIOS, then poke at
ports", what does that imply?
