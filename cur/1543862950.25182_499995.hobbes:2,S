So, how about it? Is there an actual regression? If so, we should find
the cause and fix before 2.6.20 is released.
Note, sbp2's optional parameter serialize_io=0 does not work correctly
yet with some devices (it never did), therefore use sbp2 with anything
than default parameters if there are problems.
