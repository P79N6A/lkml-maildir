Is that check for (uninterruptible < 0) (copied from nr_uninterruptible)
really needed?  Can rq->nr_uninterruptible actually go negative?
Perhaps nr_context_switches() and nr_iowait() should also go into this
function, then we rename it all to
	struct sched_stuff {
		unsigned nr_uninterruptible;
		unsigned nr_running;
		unsigned nr_active;
		unsigned long nr_context_switches;
	};
	void get_sched_stuff(struct sched_stuff *);
and then convert all those random little counter-upper-callers we have.
And then give get_sched_stuff() a hotplug handler (probably unneeded) and
then scratch our heads over why nr_uninterruptible() iterates across all
possible CPUs while this new nr_active() iterates over all online CPUs like
nr_running() and unlike nr_context_switches().
IOW: this code's an inefficient mess and needs some caring for.
