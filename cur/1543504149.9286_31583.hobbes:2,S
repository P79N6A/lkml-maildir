Group,
	At: 
http://www.medsp.com/scott/alg/node35.html
	has a implimentation and description of skip lists.
	On lists that can grow beyond a specific number of
	elements, I believe that the lists should then be
	converted to skip lists.
	I am slowly working on a generic implimentation of
	the above. Maybe by Sept timeframe...
	Comments .....
