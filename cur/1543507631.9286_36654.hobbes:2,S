Greetings!  A buggy chat program from ppp 2.3.5, which would corrupt
syslog output when invoked with -e, in addition crashes both 2.2.11
and 2.2.12.  The kernel tries to kill the interrupt handler, reports
an error trying to kill an idle process, and produces a long series of
numeric call trace data to the console, but, alas as expected, not to
the syslog.  As this is a production machine, I didn't keep the system
down long enough to transcribe the output by hand.  If anyone can
think of a way I could capture this to a file, I'd be happy to trigger
this again after hours.  The bug is completely reproducible.
2.2.7 showed the corruption in syslog, but the kernel stayed up.
Take care,
