I think video.c is NOT a right solution for your problem.

hotkey.c provide a generic way to register well-known acpi device, and
well-known methods that are mostly related to hotkey.

No differences between buttons and keys to me.

You have dedicated ACPI device and method for brightness control.
So hotkey.c is the right place for support Device LCD.
As for Device ASIM, I don't understand this code in your patch,
Care to explain. It looks strange to me.
