crashk_res is an extern declaration in kexec.h. Declared as "struct 
resource" which is defined in linux/ioport.h.
For other places wherever this variable is used, ioport.h got included 
through some other header file.  Whereas for initramfs.c, either we need 
to include ioport.h explicitly or include in kexec.h. Chosen the later 
one. Probably, some comment would be better to make it clear.
Paul, do you prefer to repost the patch with the comment?
Thanks
Haren
