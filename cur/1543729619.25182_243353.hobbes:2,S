Lots of things that are easy to sum up on one sentence turn out the be 
hairy as a wookie, but yes, it does seem like a Simple(tm) problem.

Hmm...not sure about that. Not if you do want device specific fixes in 
there too...

I'll admit to having some time on my hands but acquiring equipment to 
test with would be a stumbling block for me.
It would be nice if everyone could just put their egos aside and provide 
a united front wrt FOSS cd/dvd recording.
I was going to make some suggestions about how to do the above but then 
I have also been following the cdrecord thread and I'm not sure wading 
in on that makes sense...
