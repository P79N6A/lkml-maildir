This just is not the issue. If we only wanted filesystems which behaved 
like ext2/3, we would only have ext2/3. The issue, if you have all 
forgotten, is Linus not providing information on why XFS is a problem to 
be merged. He asked them to make it easy to merge - they have done so. 
Now they ask why the patch is ignored, and are promptly ignored further.
