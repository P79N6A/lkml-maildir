1. Caps are set on a per task basis not on a group basis.
2. Sinbinning is the last resort and only used for hard caps.  The soft 
capping mechanism is also applied to hard capped tasks and natural 
competition also tends to reduce usage rates.
In general, sinbinning will only kick in on lightly loaded systems where 
there is no competition for CPU resources.
Further, there is a natural ceiling of 999 per CPU on the number tasks 
that will ever be in the sinbin at the same time.  To achieve this 
maximum some very unusual circumstances have to prevail:
1. these 999 tasks must be the only runnable tasks on the system,
2. they all must have a cap of 1/1000, and
3. the distribution of CPU among them must be perfectly fair so that 
they all have the expected average usage rate of 1/999.
If you add one more task to this mix the average usage would be 1/1000 
and if they all had that none would be exceeding their cap and there 
would be no sinbinning at all.  Of course, in reality, half would be 
slightly above the average and half slightly below and about 500 would 
be sinbinned.  But this reality check also applies to the 999 and 
somewhat less than 999 would actually be sinbinned.
As the number of runnable tasks increases beyond 1000 then the number 
that have a usage rate greater than their cap will decrease and quickly 
reach zero.
So the conclusion is that the maximum number of sinbinned tasks per CPU 
is given by:
min(1000 / min_cpu_rate_cap - 1, nr_running)
As you can see, if a minimum cap cpu of 1 causes problems we can just 
increase that minimum.
And once again I ask what's so special about containers that changes this?
