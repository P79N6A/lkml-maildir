Interesting. We discussed the case as a theoretical possibility when
the patch was merged, but it seemed to unlikely to make it worth
complicating the first version.
The solution from back then I actually liked best was to just round
up to the next second instead of rounding down when going from 1s 
resolution to ns.

e.g. like this for ext3 (untested). Does that fix your problem?
