I think we're talking past each other.
My first point is that a portable application cannot rely on close to
detect any error.  Only fsync guarantees to detect any errors at all
(except ENOSPC/EDQUOT, which should come back on write; yes, I know
about the buggy NFS implementations that report them only on close).
My second point, which you deleted, is that if some hypothetical close
implementation reports an error under some circumstances, an
immediately preceding fsync call MUST also report the same error under
the same circumstances.
Therefore, if you've checked the return value of fsync, there's no
point in checking the subsequent close; and if you don't care to call
fsync, the close return value is useless since it isn't guaranteed to
detect anything.

And watch it come back with an error again, repeat ad infinitum?

You missed the point.  The manpage asserts that I/O errors are
guaranteed to be detected by close; there is no such guarantee.
