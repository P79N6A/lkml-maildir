???
While 2.0e3 contains a bug that can cause an OOps inside the driver (just
use the echo "INQUIRY 0" >/proc/scsi/tmscsim/?), the normal bus rescanning
should not be able to trigger it. The above looks like the bug is occuring
somewhere else.
Having said this, I'd like to ask you to try 2.0e6 of the tmscsim driver and
check whether you are able to reproduce the bug.
Thanks!
Regards,
