Actually, at least SuSv3 does not say any such thing. *What* it says is  
that the return is either MAP_FAILED or the correct address, and that if  
it is called *without* MAP_FIXED, then the argument 0 has special meaning,  
and it won't map something at 0 (and thus return 0) - which, AFAICT, is  
exactly what we want it to say. Specifically, NULL is *never* an error  
return value for mmap.
At least, unless we define MAP_FAILED to be NULL - traditionally, it's  
(void *)-1 probably exactly so it is possible to return an address of 0.
