Mr. Miller,
	It's not really a deficiency. Rusty apparently decided that in
order to be SMP-compliant and to prevent Oopses, that the unregistration
function should grab the brlock so that all the packets would pass through
the protocol-handling functions. It doesn't necessarily _have_ to be done, 
because all the points which might make use of the protocol handlers are 
already locked or could be changed to use the lock, but if it should
be done, then you need a way to find out if the brlock is locked,
so that you can be fair to other people (I checked the brlock code and
didn't find any schedule()s; there's probably a reason for that).
	I suppose that if it really can't be done, then I'll remove the lock commands
for BR_NETPROTO_LOCK in the protocol API and just wait until people
report Evil Things(tm) happening when they unload. Besides, any netfilter
interface changes will have to wait until 2.5.
