Subject: [patch] disable READA

There's a bug in bread() which can cause it to misinterpret a
failed READA request as an IO error on SMP.
If a filesytem block is subject to READA and __make_request()
decides that the request would block then __make_request()
will (via end_buffer_io_sync) mark the buffer as not uptodate
and will unlock it.
But if another CPU attempts to bread() the same buffer at the same
time, the following happens:
1: ll_rw_block() sees the buffer is locked and does nothing at all
2: bread() does a wait_on_buffer()
3: the other CPU (the one doing READA) unlocks the non uptodate buffer
4: bread() sees the buffer come unlocked.  It's not uptodate, so
   bread() bogusly reports an IO error.
I haven't seen it in the wild, because it is rare to get that 
much read I/O in flight.  reiserfs and ext3 (at least) use READA.
An appropriate fix for 2.4 is to disable READA.
