Which just goes to show you have useful Steve Lord's report was.
Even someone unfamiliar with the driver could figure this out once
someone bothered to provide decend debuggin info.

That's a bit unfair David, and its also not an acurate quote.  I
did say to Nick Pasich, "I guarantee you though, it is not the aic7xxx
driver's fault" on 11/26, but ever since it became apparent that
I was wrong (11/29 perhaps?), I've been working with Nick to try
and reproduce the problem.  We all make mistakes David, even you.
Get over it. 8-)
