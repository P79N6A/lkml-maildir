There are two MSR bits involved in enabling VT.  The first bit 
enables/disables VT.  The second bit prevents the first bit from being 
changed until the next power up.
If the BIOS is setting the second bit while disabling the first bit, 
there's nothing that can be done to work around it.
Sorry.  Contact Lenovo and ask for a BIOS update.
