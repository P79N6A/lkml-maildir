I have a near endless series of dual athlon bug reporta that go
	It crashes randomly
	Run memtest86
	It says lots of bad things
In paticular if you have more than two banks of RAM on dual athlon boards it
almost always has to be registered DIMM.

Only if its another identical dual athlon and then you'd be better
running the other one and testing the one with the problem.

Until you've checked the memory - not really.
