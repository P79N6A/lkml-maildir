The overhead of the double load of the command registers is microseconds so it
is actually quite a lot, especially since IDE lacks TCQ so neither end of the
link is doing *anything* useful. SCSI has similar problems on older SCSI with 
command sending being slow, but the drive is at least doing other commands during
this.
