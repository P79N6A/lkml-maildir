    If you mean preferring 'if ()' over 'ifdef'... Linus.  :)  And I agree
    with him:  code looks -much- more clean without ifdefs.  And the
    compiler should be smart enough to completely eliminate code inside an
    'if (0)' code block.
Not only that; we should move to code where the compiler engine can
sanitize the code; the preprocessor alternative is obviously more
limited here.
The same can also be said for some of the many macro's that are
#defined; some would surely be better as inline functions is we could
ensure they would always be in-lined.
