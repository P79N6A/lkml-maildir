I don't claim to be a VLAN expert but there are really three cases
for handling tagged frames
1) non-accelerated device 
    * all frames show in promiscious mode
    * tag is part of the frame that shows up
       in tcpdump, and then gets stripped by the 8021q module.
2) rx tag stripping device
     * all frames show in promiscious mode
     * tag is in skb but NOT passed to tcpdump
3) rx vlan acceleration
     * only frames that for vlan's that are registered show up
        in promisicous mode
     * tag is in skb but NOT passed to tcpdump
Unfortunately, the tag is lost as part of the VLAN acceleration process
so it is not a simple matter of changing code in AF_PACKET receive
to restore the tag.
