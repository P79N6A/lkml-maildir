There appear to be a lot of conflicts between my development tree and
the -mm6 patch.  Even your patch doesn't apply cleanly, though I think
it is only because a piece has already been applied.
I'm starting with 2.6.5, applying Russell King's 2.6.5 patch from the
8th, applying -mm6 patch, and then yours.  It looks like a good bit of
Russell's patch has been included in the -mm6.  But not enough of mm6
is present in my tree for your patch to work.
I'm working on the scripts and BK docs.  At this point, I may have to
wait for 2.6.6 before we can make another test.
