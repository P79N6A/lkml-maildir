That's what I give him. In fact, if it would not be written in 
dutch, I could include here the e-mail that I sent to a local 
computer weekly after they printed a negative article about him.
In it I point out how they failed to do their research, that 
if they had done it properly they would not have printed their 
negative claims about his motivations, and that I therefore 
strongly suggest that they print an apology and a correction 
in a later edition.
But all that does not make him a faultless god. With respect to 
the GNU/Linux thing he is wrong for no other reason that it is 
not up to people to rename somebody elses product/brainchild.
Besides, his reasoning for it does not hold. (And yes, I build 
my entire system from source myself, so I *do* know how much of 
it is GNU.)
Yes, I respect him. And still I think that on this topic his
motivations are personally biased because events overtook him
so that The Hurd no longer has a chance to not make it big time,
independent of its technical merits. And maybe also because 
others get "more" credit/visibility for the free/open source 
ideas. But that is a price that one must be willing to pay when 
one decides to steer a course that is seen by the "normal world" 
as confrontational. I applaud the (very) few people who are 
willing to do this kind of thing, but consider that they must 
accept the consequences. All of them.
Finally, let me at this point explicitly join the crowd that 
wants this thread moved out of linux-kernel.
