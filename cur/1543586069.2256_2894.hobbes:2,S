Thought of theses already (well, at least ld...)
strip - not used that much (most executables still have their symbol table
	but could be handled by removing the execute bit, stripping, then
	putting it back. Or just use the ld option -s.
objcopy - copies object files. Object files are not marked executable...
ld	- on other UNIX systems (Cray/IRIX), I think the output file
	(-o) specified is first deleted. Whenever I can cause a link
	error, the output is not marked executable. If the GNU ld doesn't
	delete it first, then it most likely should.
I was expecting shell scripts to be the complaint first... :-)
