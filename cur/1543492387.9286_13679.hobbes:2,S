No arguments from me there, I've always felt that way...

Personally, I'd prefer to see the winmodem drivers appear as userland
daemons with the absolute minimum of kernel code included to allow
them to be used. Reasons, in no particular order, include:
 1. Less kernel bloat. The tool will only be in memory when it's
    actually in use, whereas kernel code is normally a permanent
    feature of the memory map.
 2. Libraries. Userland tools can make full use of the standard
    libraries such as libc which are not available to kernel code.
 3. Easier development. In my experience, it's much easier to debug
    userland stuff than kernel code.

Personally, I've never had one, nor have I any interest in getting
one, but if somebody wishes to develop a GENERIC winmodem driver, and
the device specific API to enable it to work with lots of different
winmodems, I say go for it.
However, I would caution against developing a winmodem driver that's
specific to one particular brand of winmodems, especially if it's not
a common brand. The heart of the winmodem driver should be pretty
standard, in my opinion...
Best wishes from Riley.
