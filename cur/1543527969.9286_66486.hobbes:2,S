	Others may have URLs, I don't.
	- "SMP" = "Symmetric Multi Processing"
	  (Or in case of Linux:  "Symmetric Multi Penguin" --  a joke)
	- Pre-emption is a thing where executing thread is involuntarily
	  stopped from doing whatever it was doing, and processor is given
	  to another thread.   Linux kernel DOES NOT DO THAT INTERNALLY.
	  Well, there is a sort of hierarchy of pre-emptions:
		- user threads (+ kernel threads for user syscalls)
		  - scheduling in between user threads
		- interrupt processing
	- Only pre-emption what there is, does happen in between compute-
	  bound user processes when process' timeslice has completed.
	- Kernel threads can voluntarily YIELD their processor to other
	  tasks by means of waiting for some resource, or executing
	  explicite  schedule() call.
	- As to why the kernel isn't made internally pre-emptive; doing
	  such a thing is *difficult*, very difficult.
	  System would need to be rewritten to allow internal execution
	  stopped at any point, and having other processors/threads trample
	  on incomplete datasets at any point...
	  (Multiprocessor support requires sort of this behaviour anyway,
	   and that is why there are various spinlocks all over the place..)
