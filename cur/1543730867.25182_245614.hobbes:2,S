but filesystems are exactly always modules (in precompiled kernels at
least).
Anyways I don't see any visible EXPORT_SYMBOL in reiser4.

then it seems a bit misleading to call those things plugins.
As you wrote those are "users of the reiser4 core API", with plugins I
always meant dynamically loadable things, like plugins for web browers
(hence kernel modules in kernel space). While here apparently you can't
plugin anything at runtime, it's just code that uses the reiser4 core
API that can be modified with a kernel patch as usual.
