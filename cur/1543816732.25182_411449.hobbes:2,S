But active_load_balance() is the only code that would want to move the 
only runnable task off a CPU, isn't it?  No other load balancing code 
will try to do this that I can see.

Yes, I've read that which is why I say (see below) that it's backwards 
and haphazard.
I'll make a temporary patch that does the PREFER I mentioned above to 
tide us over until a proper rewrite of the active load balancing 
functionality can be done.  After giving it some more thought I think I 
can keep the extra complexity fairly small.

It seems to me that it's being done backwards and haphazardly.  As far 
as I can see the problem that's trying to be solved is there is a 
package that has two or more CPUs that have exactly one runnable task 
and there are other packages that have all of their CPUs idle and we 
want to move one task to each idle package, right?
If any of the CPUs in the package have more than one runnable task then 
normal load balancing will kick in which is why I say this special code 
is only required for the case where there's exactly one task for two or 
more of the CPUs in the package.
So why not write code that (every so many ticks) checks to see if a 
package meets these criteria and if it does then looks for idle packages 
(that's packages not groups or queues) and if it finds them initiates 
active load balancing?  Or some variation of that theme.
At the end of scheduler_tick() you could do (every so many ticks):
if rebalance_tick() didn't pull any tasks and this run queue has exactly 
one runnable task then
         if the package that this run queue is in meets the criteria then
                 set the run queue's active_balance flag and let the 
migration thread know that it has work to do.
Properly packaged this code could be excluded from the build on 
architectures that don't need it.

Yes, but this particular problem is a very minor especially when 
compared to the general breakage of "nice" on SMP systems without the 
smpnice patch.
