First of all, you should not use gcc 2.96 for 2.2.x kernel compiles, only
2.4 should work.

I've fixed this recently. Some of these warnings were actually valid, I'll
post a kernel patch for these soon, but most of them were bogus warnings
when kernel was using GNU , ## restargs extension.

One cannot preprocess with -traditional and use macros with variable

If you're using recent Red Hat distributions, use kgcc compiler instead of
gcc to compile the kernel.
