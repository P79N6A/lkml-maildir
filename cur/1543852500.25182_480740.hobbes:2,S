Kevent pipe benchmark kevent_pipe kernel kevent part:
epoll (edge-triggered):   248408 events/sec
kevent (edge-triggered):  269282 events/sec
Busy reading loop:        269519 events/sec
Kevent is definitely a winner with extremely small overhead.
I will add kevent_pipe into next kevent release which will be available
soon.
