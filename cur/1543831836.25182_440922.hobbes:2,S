Subject: Frequent reboots with mm6

Hello again!
My server running mm6 restarts every few hours and I have no clue why it
is doing that. I can't see any correlation with load or temperature or
any other event. I might have problems with parts of the hardware (see two
other threads startet by me in the last few days), but this should not
cause a reboot to my knowledge (crashes are fine...). The log files do
not reveal a thing.
Please tell me why a kernel would initialize reboot (or is it the BIOS?
Something else?).
More details:
- 2.6.17-mm6
- 945P chipset with iCH7R doing 4x SATA2 (software raid, AHCI, NCQ(?))
- Pentium D 805 (dualcore)
- Intel PCI Express network card
- running NFS (for a client doing NFS root)
Thanks,
