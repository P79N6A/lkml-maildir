I am saying I have to use __u32, because they are user visible and u32
is not.  Also, the rule is to use __u32.

How else is user-space to know about this structure?
It has always been a no-no for user-space to access __KERNEL__ wrapped
parts of headers, but sharing a header (or at least generating
user-space's version of the header from the kernel header) is the only
way to ensure that both kernel and user-space speak the same language.
And not just structures, but flags, ioctl commands, ...
