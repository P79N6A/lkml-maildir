[ Sorry, I didn't get this out earlier, but you're just too damn fast with 
your resubmissions.. ;)]
Don't use struct device for the firmware objects. They're not really
devices; they're another type of entity that has some sort of magic 
ia32 voodoo relationship with real devices. 
I recently converted ACPI to abandon the notion that the namespace objects 
were real devices. In doing so, I gave them their own top-level directory 
in driverfs. Don't do this. That's only a temporary solution until I 
create a 'firmware' or 'platform' directory for all of you people to live.

How about a symlink to the bus's directory? Or the PCI device that is the 
controller?

And, a symlink to the device itself? I liked it better the way you had it 
before :)

Ugh. Drop the ascii-fying hexdump for one. I'd also strongly encourage you 
to split the data in 'info' to separate files.
