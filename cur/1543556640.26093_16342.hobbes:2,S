Kernel Hackers,
    Could someone be so kind to point me to a page where I can find
a list of parameters I can pass to a kernel on boot.  I am looking for 
a way to load drivers at boot (like if a RAID controller fails - and I 
don't have the exact replacement: how can I load a new driver).  I 
am really just looking for the doc.  Thanks in advance!
