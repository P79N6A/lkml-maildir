That the kernel depends on a funny side effect of the assembler.  It's
harmless, but if you don't like it, apply the patch below.  Linus,

The warning is correct, the calculated value for ramdisk_max would be
0xb7ffffff instead of 0x37ffffff.  Truncating 0xb7ffffff to 0x37ffffff
is desired behaviour, so we should do it explicitly.
