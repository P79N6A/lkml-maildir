Linux has a LED subsystem for that. May I suggest, that you just register
these leds and let userspace handle them via that via the LED API?
The LED userspace API is described in Documentation/leds-class.txt
and the headers for registering LEDs is linux/leds.h under include/
Since you explicitly WANT user space to control these, that should
be the right API. 
Richard, what do YOU think?
Best Regards
