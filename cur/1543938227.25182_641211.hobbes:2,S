Please, tell what in the license forbids me to make a global replacement
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL -> EXPORT_SYMBOL and distribute the result?
For me, on the other hand, it is against the spirit of free software to 
actively make a block for people to do what ever they want with the code 
when they are only doing it to themselves. That includes loading non-GPL 
software into the kernel. The only thing they  are not allowed to do is to
distribute it and in that way "hurt" other people.
