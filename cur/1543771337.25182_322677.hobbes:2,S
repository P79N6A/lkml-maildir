That would appear to be the case. I'd like to run a few tests that require
order-3 allocations a lot. My current thinking is that running stress
tests over a CIFS filesystem may do the job. I'm open to suggestions.

If swap is turned off, it will not work as well. However, buffer pages are
grouped together with anonymous pages so we might not get MAX_ORDER
allocations succeeding, but I think it the order-3 to 5 allocations would
still have a higher success rate.  If we found that no-swap was a common
scenario, we could teach the patch to treat anonymous userspace pages as
KERNNORCLM rather than USERRCLM. The ordinary file-backed pages would then
be freeable for the high order allocations. mlock() is a case I have not
thought about at all.
These cases would be addressed by page migration but page migration is a
lot more complex than this lower fragmentation patch.

No offence taken, I had trouble keeping the performance of this patch
comparable to the normal allocator and the patch is large for a problem
that seems so straight-forward. Despite the additional complexity, the
performance is still comparable (sometimes it runs faster, other times
slower). It is only when memory is running low that the additional lists
that were introduced have to be searched.

Again, I would assert that our Supported-ness is better with this patch
than without it. If we wanted to really support high-order allocations, we
would also need to be able to free pages in adjacent physical pages, not
just LRU ordering.

It isn't that simple :(. This was my first solution and one I dropped
after a while. Under a stress test, the two areas meet and fragmentation
is as bad as it ever was. It would only delay the problem, not fix it.
Even if there is a shared zone in the middle that both can use, it will
fill.
I ran a stress test over large periods of time with this patch and it
managed to consistently keep fragmentation down. In fact, the introduction
of the fallback reserve was to address the problem of slowly fragmenting
over long periods of time
