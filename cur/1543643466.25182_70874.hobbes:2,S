Subject: [patch] init-fix-2.5.34-A0, BK-curr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/9/15/56

the attached patch makes all init-inherited kernel threads show up again
in the 'ps' process list on BK-curr (including init itself). I'm not quite
sure why CLONE_THREAD was added to CLONE_SIGNAL - is there any reason
kernel threads should not be separate entities?
