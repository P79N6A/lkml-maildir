This maybe works as PR, but otherwise it's crap.
With a network protocol you have multiple possibilities to increase the
reliability. The lower you do it in the network layer the easier is it
to put it into hardware and to optimize it and the more generically it's
usable. Doing it in the protocol is only the last resort. The iSCSI
protocol is a nice protocol - if you ignore all the crap the hardware
vendors put in (that stuff only makes sense if you want to produce ultra
cheap hardware).
bye, Roman
