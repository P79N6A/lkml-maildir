Oh, it's been discussed, many times.  Here is my executive summary of
why nobody needs to use kernel headers in userspace programs, *EVER*:
Q: I want to #include <linux/foo.h> but I get compile errors, please
   apply this patch to foo.h.
A: Make a copy of foo.h, fix it up to compile properly in your
   application and ship it in your tarball.
Q: What if foo.h changes?  My copy will be out of date and my app will
   not work properly on new kernels.
A: This is exactly the same problem as userspace ABI drift.  And it has
   exactly the same solution: make sure userspace interfaces to kernel
   functionality are as stable as possible.  We really *do* try not to
   gratuitously break binaries ... except certain system utilities
   which are low-level enough to justify telling the user to upgrade
   (and that's a short list -- see Documentation/Changes.)
Q: What about new features?  What if foo.h gets some new ioctl
   definitions?  My copy won't have these and my app won't be able to
   use them.
A: So resync with the kernel copy, when the need arises.  Obviously
   your app won't magically be able to just use the new functionality
   without other changes on your part -- resyncing foo.h is just a
   small part of the changes you are already making anyway.
Q: I maintain a subsystem with tightly-coupled userspace and kernel
   components.
A: So maintain *your* header files however you wish, but just ship
   separate copies in your kernel patches and userspace tarballs.
