Looks good for code browsing. There is something similar at:
http://lxr.linux.no/
But i was trying to say that there is no information about
global concept or at least i can't find any. One example:
My last Linux project is writing usb ethernet device driver
and found that perfectly working on 2.3.43, it even don't
compiles on 2.3.4[56]. I find out there are some major difference
in new network drivers code (bottom halves are gone and net device
locking is different). Now i have to find and grep a lot until
i reach the previous drivers stability. When i tried to find
the author/maintainer of the last changes i found that they were
made by "Linux Kernel Team" - no email addresses no URLs.
Now i am 10-15 days back in development.
It will be good if we have better way to communicate.
regards,
Petkan
