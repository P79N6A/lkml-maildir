The bzImage be safely loaded run in that mode.  The only question is one
of arguments.  Because there are no standards.  For Etherboot we are good.
For the insanity that is GRUB I haven't the faintest clue but we should
be ok as we don't have a multiboot header.

The entry point that is exported is the kernels protected mode entry point
that is used after the real mode code has been run.  This is to allow
bootloaders like kexec where running the real-mode code is insane or
impossible to be used.  
The calling conventions though are not changed, this is just formalizing
something that various groups have been doing for years.  Since it is
all in the bzImage we still only have a single file format to support,
so any bootloader that can load a standard bzImage and run the kernels
real mode code should still do it that way but.  If you can't the
rest of the information is available.
