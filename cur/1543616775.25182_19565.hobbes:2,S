I'm not sure you want or need a natsemi_reset here - I'll need to check my
notes on this when I get back to work.  Can I ask why this change was made?
This is a very hard case to reproduce, so I'm not very comfortable changing
the codepath :)  We've had National looking at this buggy behavior for
months now, with little result.

is this intended to blow away the other bits in IntrMask?  Keep in mind
that Wake-On-Phy requires the PHY interrupt enabled, but I don't know if it
needs it on in intrmask or just in the Phy intr reg.
There are a few changes in here I want to double check, but all my
test-setup and notes for natsemi are at work - I may have more comments
next week.
