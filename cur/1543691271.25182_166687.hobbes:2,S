For SDET on the NUMA-Q, it's pretty small.  Looks like well less than
1%.  Mostly lost in the noise, though.

For those of you who care, I generated this with a neat little tool that
some interns cooked up for us this summer.  You hand it a little file
like this and it throws back a wealth of information back at you. 
There's a central machine to which has a database of other machines and
figures out the best fit for the job (can be more than 1 machine
requested).  In this case it's easy because there are very few 16x
machines in the database.  Oh, and like good interns, they stole a lot
of code from Steve Pratt's "autobench".
