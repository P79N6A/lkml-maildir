	9.0.1 is the latest release in the 9.x series and if you are
interested in "SecureDNS", that's the way to go.  I'm currently running
9.1.0beta2, and it seems rock solid to me.  There is also 8.2.2P7 if
you want to stick the the older 8.x series, but I certainly wouldn't
if I were setting up a new DNS server.  The 4.x series is totally
deprecated at this point.  Personally, I wouldn't use anything less
than 9.0.1 and I currently support over 100 domains on my servers
(my partner runs a hosting service).
