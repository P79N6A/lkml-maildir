No. Some architectures have compile-time support for multiple different
page sizes (e.g. Itanium, SPARC64); many have support for a
(non-swappable) `large pages) system, and a filesystem backed by huge
pages. (Often, the kernel is stored in huge pages, to keep the number
of page table entries wasted by the nonswappable kernel to a minimum.)
What is *not* presently supported is using multiple page sizes to
back userspace processes; that size is currently fixed at compile-time,
even on architectures supporting multiple variably-sized pages.
