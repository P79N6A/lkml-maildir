Alpha's <sys/poll.h> file was so far compatible with most of the other
archs (except SPARC).  Since the introduction of POLLREMOVE it's
different.  In Alpha:
 #define POLLREMOVE     (1 << 11)
+#define POLLRDHUP       (1 << 12)
For the other archs:
 #define POLLREMOVE     0x1000
+#define POLLRDHUP       0x2000
For Alpha the values should have been 1<<12 and 1<<13.  Neither
POLLREMOVE nor POLLRDHUP have been in any glibc header.  How widely are
they used elsewhere?  Is it too late to change the Alpha definitions to
match the rest?
