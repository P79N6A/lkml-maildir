  I finally got it worked. Very good job, thank you. I simply used
fbset -a -xres 1024 -yres 768 -vxres 1024 -vyres 768 -depth 32 -t 10000 192 0 41 21 96 15 -accel true
  and got 90 Hz (get rid of annoying 60 Hz with vesafb, grrr).
  I did not met any problems when working on consoles. I'm going to test
  something using svgalib tonight.
  However, when I had started X, the computer rebooted just after about
  three seconds. strace -o file did not write anything. I don't know
  how I should search for the reason. Maybe you can help me ?
  My X works with vesafb good, anyway. Both settings I did after fbset -x
  output.

  I have the fresh (yesterday's :-) Debian 2.2 (potato) installed.
  I'm trying to test it only with twm in the meanwhile.
  My system:
    MB Tekram (A) P6B40-A4X (iBX Slot1)
    CPU PII Celeron 333
    RAM 128 MB
    HDD IBM 10 GB
    ATI Rage Fury 16 MB TV
    
    Debian 2.2 (unstable-potato)
    kernel 2.3.26
  Have you ever noticed such accidental reboots ?
  Thank you and keep up the good work, anyway.
