Nope. My kernel is on /dev/hda1 (hd0,0) which is the boot partition. 
Then /dev/hda3 is the root partition.
I am booting the correct kernel - with XFS support.

I've attached my 2.4 dmesg.
I can't capture or even read the 2.6 output as it scrolls off the screen too 
fast. I think it's finding the drive and using the correct IDE chipset 
driver, but I can't see the details.
I really can't see why this is happening. All the usual IDE stuff is compiled 
in, as is the correct IDE chipset driver, as is XFS...
Thanks,
David.
