Hi all,
I've found that when I try to burn a CD in 2.4.10 using cdrdao I get the lots of
the following error:
__alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x1d2/0) from c012cd56
This happens every time I burn a CD larger than about 300M. Sometimes 
the OOM killer starts killing processes as well, but I haven't found a reliable
way to reproduce this.
I get no errors using 2.4.9, or if I use cdrecord instead of cdrdao.
Regards,
Steven
