Subject: regression on HP zx1 platform from ACPI autoload modules patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I am seeing a regression on the HP ia64 zx1 platforms when using
a .config with CONFIG_IA64_HP_ZX1=y.  Oddly it works OK with
CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC=y.
During bootup it panics with:
Kernel panic - not syncing: Unable to find SBA IOMMU: Try a generic or DIG kernel
I can provide the full console output if that is helpful.  Also, please let
me know if there is any other data I can provide that would be helpful.
Using git bisect I have narrowed it down to these 2 commits.  These commits
cannot be built separately as they appear to have code that depends on each
other.

    ACPI: autoload modules - Create ACPI alias interface
    Modify modpost (file2alias.c) to add acpi*:XYZ0001: alias in modules.alias
    like:
    grep acpi /lib/modules/2.6.22-rc4-default/modules.alias
    alias acpi*:SNY5001:* sony_laptop
    alias acpi*:SNY6001:* sony_laptop
    for e.g. the sony_laptop module.
    This module matches against all ACPI devices with a HID or CID of SNY5001
    or SNY6001
    Export an uevent and modalias sysfs file containing the string:
    [MODALIAS=]acpi:PNP0C0C:
    additional CIDs are concatenated at the end.
