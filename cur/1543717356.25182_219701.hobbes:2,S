I escaped from CVS in 1994, underwent several years of therapy, and
haven't used it since.  I don't know what ACPI CVS is on SF, point me to
it and I'll be happy to delete it.
The latest ACPI is published here:
http://linux-acpi.bkbits.net/
and here:
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/
though these are generally never more than 10 days newer than
the latest 2.4, 2.6, and 2.6-mm trees.
cheers,
