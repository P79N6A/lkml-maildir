Hi,
while tracking down some timer related ugliness I stumbled over the
timer driven function rt_secret_rebuild(), which does a loop over
rt_has_mask (1024 in my case) entries and possibly some subsequent
variable sized loops inside each step.
On a 300MHZ PPC system this accumulated to a worst case total of >5ms. I
could not reproduce it with this magnitude, but applying heavy
networking load is definitely triggering this behaviour.
Shouldn't this be converted to a workqueue, which gets triggered by a
timer instead of blocking the timer softirq and therefor the delivery of
other timer functions that long ?
