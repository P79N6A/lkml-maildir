it's specific to all smp architectures I suppose

Core2DUO is only one generation of Intel processors; however I know that
several other (if not all of them) have issues with this kind of thing
in ring 0; all subtly different ;(
All other alternatives are ok right now (they all run in UP mode),
but... I'm just very nervous about the amount of CPU errata in this kind
of scenario. And I'm not just talking Intel, I wouldn't be surprised if
the other x86 CPU vendors also have issues with this; I don't know how
well they specify their errata though..
