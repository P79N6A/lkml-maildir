One thing that struck me about this; doesn't both the rmap-patches and
the aa-patches contain other changes than merely changes to the VM? If
so, couldn't these changes tip the result in an unfair direction?! After
all, what we want is a VM-to-VM shoot-out, not a VM-to-VM+whatever
shoot-out. After all, one would assume that the non VM-related changes
would be merged to the kernel no matter what VM is used, right?
Then again, maybe I just ate the blue pill and returned to a world of
illusions not knowing what's best for me.
