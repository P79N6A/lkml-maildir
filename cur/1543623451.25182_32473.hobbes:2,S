It probably doesn't really matter.  For performance, we want to stream
both the journal writes and the primary disk writeback as much as
possible, but a bit of latency in the synchronisation between the two
ought to be largely irrelevant.
Much more significant than the external-journal case is probably the
stripe case, either with raid5, striped LVM or raid-1+0.  In that
case, even sequential IO to the notionally-sequential journal may have
to be split over multiple disks, and at that point the pipeline stall
in the middle of IO that was supposed to be sequential will really
hurt.
Cheers,
 Stephen
