Subject: [PATCH] remove NR_SUPER define
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Last month I removed the "or too many mounted filesystems"
part from an error message in mount(8) - NR_SUPER has not
been used in a very long time.
Also NR_RESERVED_FILES is unused today.
