Hello,
Here are two patches for compile failures in 2.3.32-pre3 but I didn't send
them to Linus because the system does not boot (and won't enter kdb even)
and I don't know if it is to do with my patches or not (probably not). I
do recall it complained about a few things in kdb so perhaps there are
some changes that need updating for kdb - I will have a look when I get a
chance. Files are arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c and include/linux/fs.h:
