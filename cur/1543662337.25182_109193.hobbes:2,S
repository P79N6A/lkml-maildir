No. At least in the US, 17 USC 106 says producing a derivative right is reserved to the
copyright holder, except for the cases enumerated in 17 USC 107-121.
So if you're producing a derivative work without having gotten the rights
to do so, you're screwed in the legal sense.
Clause 2 of the GPL gives you the right to produce derivative works *IF*
you accept the conditions.  Having accepted that clause, you're bound by
it - that's what makes the GPL work.
Please enumerate what *OTHER* way you are getting the right to produce a
derivative work, rather than via the GPL clause 2.  (Note that this *could*
happen, if for instance code is dual-licensed and you are getting the right
via the other license).

Note again that two of these rights (distribute the original, distribute
the modifications) are *NOT* ones you inherently have - you are getting them
*WITH RESTRICTIONS* on what you can and can't do (see clause 2 again).

It's the sum of several rights, one of which is "creating a derived work".
If you can't legally create a derived work, you can't legally distribute same.
