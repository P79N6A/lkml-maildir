Subject: Kernel panic on alpha cpu 2.6.13-2.6.15 not in 2.6.10
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Was: "Kernel crash on alpha cpu 2.6.13-2.6.15"
Part 2: The system has crashed again today with "kernel panic - not syncing: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!"
After 3 days uptime!
Is there any way with do_exit() to find out, which interrupt or kernel code this is?
Is it possible to print out a kernel stack trace in do_exit()?
The Magic Keys don't work in the normal way for the alpha.
Original Mail:
Hello
Summary:
alpha cpu 64 Bit
kernel-2.6.10: ok
kernel-2.6.13-2.6.15: problem
eth0: 3Com Corporation 3C905B Fast Etherlink XL 10/100
Kernel crash, reboot problem due to kernel-log-buffer flooted with message.
No problem on x86 with same network card.
Kernel not stable on alpha cpu!
With hardreset (power-off) everything is ok, until the next time.
Detail:
kernel-2.6.15: Kernel crashs after 5-15days, no message is logged in syslog (klogd -2 -p -c 3).
Autoreboot after crash is active and when the kernel boots again, the syslog
is flooted with the messages:
kernel: eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
kernel: eth0: PCI bus error, bus status 40000020
kernel: eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
kernel: eth0: PCI bus error, bus status 40000020
kernel: eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
kernel: eth0: PCI bus error, bus status 40000020
kernel: eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
kernel: eth0: PCI bus error, bus status 40000020
kernel: eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
[..]
About 20 lines per second! -> BTW: Why this is not catched from klogd/syslogd to one entry per second?
The text is in "drivers/net/3c59x.c line 2149 (2.6.15):
3c59x.c:2149:           printk(KERN_ERR "%s: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register %4.4x.\n",
A diff between 2.6.10 and 2.6.15 3c59x.c shows a lot of lines changed, and the i/o calls like "inw" changed to
"ioread16" aso - maybe this is a probem.
