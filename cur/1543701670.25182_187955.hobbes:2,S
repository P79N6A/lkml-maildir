Developers shound NOT be running slow machines, but they should be 
testing slow machines. I do my builds on a four way Xeon machine, and 
install on a slow machine for test.
If you look at some of the response testing I'm doing, it's one a 96MB 
p3-350, just for that reason. And I have a P5-133 I built but haven't 
really benchmarked yet, it has only 64MB. I think the place such slow 
machines are relevant is embedded, which is why I occasionally rant 
about locking in code to hide Athlon CPU bugs which just wastes space on 
unbroken machines.
I have a pile of 486 machines I want to run as firewalls, don't plan to 
do kernel builds on those, either :-(
