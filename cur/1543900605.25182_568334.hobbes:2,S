Stranger thing to me is that this is like Déjà Vu. Many have asked
this same question. When users were asked for their comment before
many end users and some developers have given rave reviews. I don't
remember anyone giving it the heavy thumbs-down, with exception of
when things needed fixing (over 6 months ago?). It continues to go
unmerged. Is there a clear answer on what needs to happen for it to
get merged?
