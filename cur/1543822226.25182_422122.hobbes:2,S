Subject: [PATCH 2/3] x86 align highmem zone boundries with NUMA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

x86 align highmem zone boundries with NUMA
When in x86 NUMA mode we allocate struct pages's node local and map
them into the kernel virtual address space in the remap space.
This space cuts into the end of ZONE_NORMAL.  When we round
ZONE_NORMAL down we must ensure we maintain the zone boundry
constraint, we must round to MAX_ORDER.
