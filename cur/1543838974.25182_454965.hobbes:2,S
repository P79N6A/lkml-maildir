The easiest, no need to talk to a lawyer, most economical, way out of
this is to simply make all source code open and published under the GPL
or GPL compatible license with the appropriate "signed-off" entries.
As soon as you start trying to release some part of it as binary code,
then lawyers have to be involved and that tends to cost a lot more.
People on this list are NOT lawyers, so don't ask about that option on
this list.
From the business perspective, it is likely to be far more profitable to
 deliver an open source GPL licensed product to market, as you are then
likely to get a lot of free development effort work done for you by your
users.
