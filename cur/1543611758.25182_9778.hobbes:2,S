Maybe you ought to try the preempt-kernel patch on your current kernel,
since it may of been responsible for your interactivity improvements.
Although I don't make explicit 2.5 patches available yet, the
2.4.17-pre1 or 2.4.16 patches should apply.  Conversely, 2.4.17-pre2 has
some changes that may improve latency.  You want to try it, or, even
better, it with the preemptive kernel patch.
The preempt-kernel patches can be found at:
