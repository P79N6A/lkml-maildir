Thanks for running this.  I too remember SDET, but I won't claim
to be old. :)
We were doing some more analysis on the multi-queue scheduler and
noticed that performance has regressed since posting preliminary
numbers with the 2.4.0-test10 kernel.  After comparing the code,
it looks like I have over-engineered for the worst case of lock
contention.  This was done at the expense of the normal case.
I'm currently working on this situation and expect to have a new
patch out in the not too distant future.
I expect the numbers will get better.
