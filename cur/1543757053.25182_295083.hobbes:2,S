You can boot a SUSE 9.2 with parallel init scripts (default AFAIR),
sequential init scripts and with a Makefile based solution. "Normal"
(not Makefile based) parallel booting is possible much longer on SUSE,
at least since 9.0 IIRC.
And guess what? "Parallel booting" alone, regardless of the mechanism
does not make much of a difference for the boot time.
