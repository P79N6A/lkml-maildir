I thought Linux is an OS of choices.
Calling folks for removing an opition
is not really what i do think is good.
There might be still situations where
it makes sense stripping of the exit
codings of the kernel.
Namely i would classify diskless embedded
systems (like consumer devices), that are 
allowed to shut down instantly by just
powering them off, to be such cases.
It would make life much easier for people
that do program for such targets if the
already existing optional macros would
stay in the source as they are now.
