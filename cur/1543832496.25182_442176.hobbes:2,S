I'm sorry for being so negative, but it seems you are overdesigning a 
solution for a non-existing problem:
There are cases where the machine is simply dead with exactly zero 
information. These are the really hard ones.
Then there are cases where the kernel is able to print a BUG() or Oops 
to a log file. Or the error message is printed to the screen and the 
user uses a digital camera and sends the photo.
The message is usually enough for starting to debug the problem or 
asking the user for additional information.
But most important, the problem lies in a completely different area:
Interaction between kernel devlopers and users is not a real problem.
The real problem is the missing developer manpower for handling bug 
reports.
