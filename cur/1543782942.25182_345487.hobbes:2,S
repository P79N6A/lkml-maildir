Generally this is a good idea to track the usage/testing time of different

The idea isn't bad but lots of people could think that this is some kind 
of home-phoning or spy software. I guess lots of people would turn this 
feature off...and of course you can't enable it by default. But combined 
with an automatic oops/panic/bug-report this would be _very_ useful I think.
Let's see what others say about it.
