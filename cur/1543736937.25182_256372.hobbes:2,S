Or alternatively configure 127.0.0.1 on loopback and
start portmapper before you mount NFS. You can kill portmapper
before you pivot_root into "real" root dir.
From /linuxrc on my initrd:
echo "# Configuring interfaces"
# Optional, for NFS happiness
ip l set dev lo up
ip a add 127.0.0.1/8 dev lo
...
rpc.portmap             # for statd (which is implicitly started by mount)
while true; do
    mount -n -o ro $ROOTFS /new_root \
    && break
    echo "mount -n -o ro $ROOTFS /new_root failed (err:$?)"; sleep 2
done
killall rpc.portmap     # portmap keeps old root busy
...
