Yes, we've all seen how much better NT is.

Do you have any justification whatsoever for your opposition to demand
allocation of memory?

If your app takes all the available memory, it should be blatantly
obvious that you have done something wrong. The only overcommit
related problem here is if your application allocates address space it
never uses, in which case it can run out of address space before it
runs out of memory. Even this should be fairly clear in a debugger,
though.
