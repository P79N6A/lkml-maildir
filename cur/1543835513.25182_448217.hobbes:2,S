Well the problem is more the fear that when one vendor gets this in
the tree all others will follow. And there'll be several
incompatible userspace daemons for every possible wireless card which
you need to get the system to work (think boot cd, install over wlan).
So if this is done, there should be a clearly abstracted interface
for such a daemon. I don't see what the daemon is doing more than
echo 1 4 7 8 > /sys/.../allowed_channels and a control circuit for
tx/rx power.

If it's done via a standard interface as the firmware loading
is, no objection.
