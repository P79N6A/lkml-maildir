Dear all!
I am sorry to forward this letter to the kernel list, however it is partly
kernel-related, as the below named IDE chipset is partly supported in the Linux
kernel. 
The main writer of that driver has moved, so I could'nt reach him.
Others did not answered either.
-------------------------------------------------------
I am very glad, that linux has support for this ide chip.
But the problem is, it doesn't support dma and pio mode4 for me.
When turning on dma by hdparm or kernel setting, the hard disk dies and
the whole system freezes, expect the magick sysrq keys (2.4.0-test4)
version 2.2.16 does the same.
Is it possible that these hws don't even know what dma is?
I mean, that you talk about pio modes 1-3 only.
There is no support for dma in the hd or the chip?
How could I speed up my system?
My config is:
lspci:

>00:00.0 Host bridge: OPTi Inc. 82C557 [Viper-M] (rev 14)

Maybe there is no free dma channel for it?

it seems to support DMA and pio mode 4
How should I tune this drive for the fastest performance?
Is pio mode 4 faster than pio mode 3?
Trying hdparm -p 4 /dev/hda makes no sense, as it says, that hda selects pio
mode 3
in the setup , there is a choice of pio modes on/off and multisector on/off
I may switch those to any combination, the freeze comes.

 * with the third, 1GB drive: I got 3MB/s (hdparm), but sometimes

Well, I see the same. 
hdparm -t /dev/hda shows 3 mbyte/sec, but in real, it is very slow.
off:
win98 only works with protected mode 32 bit disk access off, I guess, this
means the dma. So the problem is the same with win98. With win95 there is no
such problem. So this might be a hw bug?
hdparm
drive settings:
readahead is on
io support = 0 (16 bit), I can set it to 32 bit.
dma=0 off, turning it on freezes the system
keepsettings=0 off, I guess it is good against misconfig.
multcount is on
nowerr is off
pio mode is 3
unmaskirq is off, what's this? may i change?
I've read the hdparm manual.
Thanks for your great work on OSS.
