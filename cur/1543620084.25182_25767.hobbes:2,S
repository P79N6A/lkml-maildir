Thanks a lot. This page seems totally unfindable by any other means. I
tried searching for dtla firmware updates with google and did not find
anything. Even IBMs own site does not find any firmware updates for
their ATA drives. Just some updates for other systems and components.

Yeah. Stupid. At least the "normal" drive fitness test and the feature
tool are available as an disk image at IBM.
