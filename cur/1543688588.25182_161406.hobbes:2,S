Subject: [PATCH] even number of kmap types
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Extend the warning comment in kmap_types.h: if you add an odd number of
new kmaps, KM_VSTACK0 becomes misaligned on odd numbered cpus.  I've not
added a corresponding BUG_ON to entry_trampoline.c, having an aversion
to errors which trigger too early to be seen.  We should do better,
perhaps #error, or robustifying the layout; but for now just comment.
Hugh
