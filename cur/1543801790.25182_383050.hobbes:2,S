I have no problem with this, since the biggest server I have is 4 way, but are 
you sure big machines wont suffer from this single spinlock ?
Also I dont understand what you want to do after this single spinlock patch.
How is it supposed to help the 'ip route flush cache' problem ?
In my case, I have about 600.000 dst-entries :
# grep ip_dst /proc/slabinfo
ip_dst_cache      616250 622440    320   12    1 : tunables   54   27    8 : 
slabdata  51870  51870      0
