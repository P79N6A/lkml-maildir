Subject: odd 2.2.17pre12 interface behaviour?

i've a 2.2.17pre12 box on an ethernet which has two IP networks overlaid.  
the box was only on one of the nets until recently, and then i added an
alias.  so i've something like:
ifconfig eth0 inet 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
ifconfig eth0:1 inet 192.168.2.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
when the eth0:1 interface is up, the source address for outgoing
INADDR_ANY sockets is 192.168.2.2.
i would think the correct source address would be 192.168.1.1, rather than
the alias address.
am i being a dolt, or is something broken?
