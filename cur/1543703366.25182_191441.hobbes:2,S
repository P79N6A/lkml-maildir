Subject: [announce] kmsgdump update for 2.6.1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The kmsgdump patch is now available for 2.6.0 and 2.6.1.
The patches can be found in:
  
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/kmsgdump/
These patches work for me on some host platforms and not on
some others.  E.g., works on
  Pentium classic UP
  Pentium III Thinkpad
not working on
  IBM dual-proc Pentium 4
I'm guessing that this is APIC or IOAPIC related and working
on solving it (slowly).
