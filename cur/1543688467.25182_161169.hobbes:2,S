Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's 
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error report:
Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu71: command not found
I have received this error when compiling both 2.4.21-0.13mdk and 2.4.22-1mdk 
when attempting to open the ALSA sound menu.
