I gave it as much testing as I could, but there comes a point where
you don't get any more test reports (because people are lazy) where
you have to throw it out for a pre-patch which *will* get testing.
I got tired of begging for people to test it.
Basic chicken and egg problem. It's the same reason Linus released
2.4.0-test* when it was really 2.3.99++.

It's a matter of degree. I did fix it, by putting locking and
refcounting in. Is that a re-write or a fix? It's a grey area. I've
been calling it a re-write, but you could also argue that it's "fix".
My main claim is that the old core wasn't amenable to fixing with a
few tweaks here and there.
Anyway, this is all semantics and history. All that matters is that
the latest code is much better, and I'm working on getting the last
wrinkles out. We're still in a pre-patch, so no need to panic yet.
I've been diligent about fixing things (mostly battling with
incomplete bug reports).
