Ok, I see the miscommunication here. you are talking about freeing up 
memory for the second kernel instead of reserving it from boot time.
I'm talking about getting the second kernel a list of what memory pages it 
should write to the image
if we can get the info for the list I'm looking for we should be able to 
demonstrate the kexec based hibernate.
the change you are talking about in an enhancment that is useful after 
that point to save some memory.

I'm missing why you need to preserve this memory
if you are talking about memory that will be used by the second kernel 
when you kexec to it then you don't need to preserve it (since it will be 
overwritten by the second kernel). if you aren't talking about memory that 
will be used by the second kernel why do you need to move it?
