	dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/shit bs=102400 count=10
Please try to duplicate the use of '/dev/zero' with your function:
	spam '0' | dd of=/tmp/shit bs=102400 count=10????
Nope.
	mkfifo /tmp/tmpshit
	spam '0' >tmpshit &
	dd if=/tmp/tmpshit of=/tmp/shit bs=102400 count=10???
No try again. And yes I know '0' != 0 but try to get a null bit
past the shell. Best of luck. echo only knows char bytes.
I do wish you people would actually TRY your examples 
before using them as a basis for argument.
If you do figure out a way to get it semi-working, please use 'time'
on it. You will find what I already know...echo is EXTREMLY slow.
time with /dev/zero:
real    0m0.021s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m0.010s
