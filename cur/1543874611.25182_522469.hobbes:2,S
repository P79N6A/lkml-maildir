Still you need to have a solution for handling bitflips in those
bootloader and kernel areas.
I don't dispute, that on a Terrabyte solid state disk which is used in a
totally different way, UBI is not necessarily the right tool.

Flashes will grow, but this will not change the embedded use case with a
relativly small FLASH and the bootloader / kernel / rootfs / datafs
scenario, where UBI is the right tool to use.
There is no hammer for all nails and I don't see device mapper doing
what UBI does right now.
