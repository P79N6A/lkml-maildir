Unfortunately, a bunch of these drivers are loadable modules, so unless
they do some trickery, boot-time allocation does not apply for them.
A similar category of drivers would like to do this dynamically too.
For drivers that want to do this a fixed number of time at bootup,
yes, boot-time allocation is the answer ...
If I am not wrong, replace_with_highmem() replaces a page when the 
kernel is quite sure there's exactly one reference on the page, and
that is from the executing code. For the dynamic case, the problem 
is in trying to rip away unknown number of kernel/user references 
from a given page. Rmaps do not guarantee it, they just improve the 
chances of success in such problems at an affordable cost.
