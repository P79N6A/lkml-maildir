Wops! Wait a minute! O11.1 is great, but I've had a few XMMS skips that
I didn't have with O10. They're really difficult to reproduce, but I've
seen them when moving a window slowly enough to make the underlying
windows accumulate a lot of redrawing events. Also, although O11.1 feels
smooth, it's not as smooth as O10 is for me. 
All in all, O11.1 is damn good, but O10 is the greatest scheduler I've
seen to date.
