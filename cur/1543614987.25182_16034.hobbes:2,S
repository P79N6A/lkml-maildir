it's exactly this kind of apps that will be screwed up by silent data
corruption. the point of the holes is to optimize performance and save
space, but they shouldn't introduce the possibilty of data corruption.
Note: I'm fine to introduce another way to notify the app about -ENOSPC,
-ENOSPC on mmap is the most obvious one, but we could still allow the
current "overcommit" behaviour with a kind of sigbus mentioned by
Andrew (possibly not sigbus though, since it has just well defined
semantics for MAP_SHARED, maybe they could be extended, anyways as said
this is only a matter of API). My point is only that some API should be
added because your mmap on sparse files are unreliable at the moment.

it is a fix (assuming people will understand/expect this retval :), but
yes, the current overcommit behaviour has some value so I agree some
other async API ala sigbus may be more desiderable.
