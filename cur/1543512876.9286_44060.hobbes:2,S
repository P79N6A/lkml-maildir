A1: I don't know. Whatever's on the motherboard. No plugin cards.
A2: PIO only. I wish I could say whether it's using mode3 or mode4.
Here's what hdparm says:
/dev/hdc:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 I/O support  =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 787/64/63, sectors = 3173184, start = 0
I've tried different multcount and readahead settings and it makes
little difference.
