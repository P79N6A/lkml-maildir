Subject: [PATCH] migration_thread preempt fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Linus,
Attached is a resend of a patch to fix a race in migration_thread which
results in a deadlock on boot for some SMP systems.  The fix is to to
disable preemption inside of set_cpus_allowed.
Andrew Morton first noticed the problem and provided the following patch
a few weeks back.  I was not affected until the recent migration_init
fix, for some odd reason.  Neither Andrew nor I think this is actually
kernel preemption's fault but perhaps a race in the tricky behavior of
the migration code.
Patch is against 2.5.8, please apply.
	Robert Love
