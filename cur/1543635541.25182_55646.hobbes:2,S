Yes, I see where truncation could be a problem.  However, one should be
able to offset this with a larger base unit and with appropriate rounding.

I looked through the A8 code, and I see that it is using a weighted average
with the last second having as much "weight" as all previous seconds.  This
is understandable (as a second is an eternity to a computer), but I wonder
how this interacts with the idle_ticks_left calculation.
Since idle_avg is only updated once a second, it will basically be around a
half-second outdated whenever it is queried.  With the smaller time
duration on idle_avg calculations, idle_avg will only describe the last 2
to 3 seconds of the CPU.  This means the statistic describes about two
seconds and is a half-second outdated - I wonder how useful this statistic
is.
Just for kicks, I wrote up a patch with a pure weighted average
calculation.  Again, I wasn't able to test this on a real kernel (I don't
have a development box I can risk 2.5 on yet).  However, I did run a bunch
of data through the two different algorithms.  The "hybrid" code matches
the pure weighted average code right after the hybrid code updates
idle_avg.  However, the pure weighted average code responds quicker to a
changing environment.  YMMV.
