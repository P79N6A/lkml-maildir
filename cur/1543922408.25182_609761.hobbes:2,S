Well, the duplication is bad, but walking lists to find the length is
inefficient so you pass around the length as well.
What irritates me more is that scatterlists aren't quite generically useful.
The virtio code wants to join a scatterlist created by blk_rq_map_sg() with
two others, yet it won't work because sg_chain() doesn't remove the end
marker from the first entry.
If this patch weren't already included, I'd be strongly arguing for the bio
idea: I find the chained sg code tricksy and ugly (sorry Jens).
To be constructive, how's this (BTW, why @arg@, I thought it was simply
"@arg"?)
===
Make sg_chain() a little more generic
Allow chaining when the first chain already has an end marker, and
change it to a slightly clearer semantic (the number of used entries
in the array, not that number plus one).
