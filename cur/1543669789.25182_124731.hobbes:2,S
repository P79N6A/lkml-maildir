Okay, this needs to be fixed.

That's future work. As soon as I get SMP machine I'll do something
about SMP. (Most probably hot unplugging all but one CPUs before
suspend and hot plugging them all back after resume.) I'd ignore SMP
problems in suspendresume for now: apm just refuses to do it on SMP,
and acpi is broken in more than one way with regard to that.
