Agred. I see now in patch-2.5.2 and the changes to ymfpci.c how to deal 
with this.
I was already suspicious that the continuous back and forth address 
space conversion
in bttv.c could be dealt with by just doing it once at initialization 
time and storing both
the physical and virtuall mapping. Will do it, when I have pyhsical 
access to the corresponding
hardware at hand.
