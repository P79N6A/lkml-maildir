ttyM was reserved for isicom, and it caused many warnings in the kernel, when
both isicom and mxser were built and loaded. The proper name for mxser is (and
ever was) ttyMI -- sorry for not giving you a notice (I didn't realize the change).

I think those with ASYNC_CLOSING test in the isr is the one (but also wakeup
spinlock change is requisite to go upstream).
