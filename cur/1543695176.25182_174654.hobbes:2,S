Why should it be an ACPI problem?  Shutdown has never had trouble powering 
down since I got the laptop.  Before Patrick forked off a suspend that 
actually worked for me, I'd shut down every time I wanted to move the laptop.  
(Ctrl-alt-backspace, ctrl-alt-delete was the fast way, I tweaked inittab to 
make that call shutdown -h.)  I'd start a shutdown, and while red hat was 
running it's 8 gazillion unnecessary scripts I'd close the lid, put the thing 
in my backpack, and forget about it.  It shut down every time, all the way 
back to at least -test3 (first version I installed on this laptop).
Now I have to leave the lid open until it's finished suspending...

Me neither.  If I get some time this weekend I'll stick beep calls into the 
code and try to force it to fail.  If I open the lid after it's hung the 
display is powered off, so I can't see any printout.  No serial port on this 
machine to rig up a serial console.  The "march of progress".  Sigh...

Nah.  My usb scanner works on this puppy just fine when I bother to modprobe 
scanner.  But I haven't plugged that in in a week.  (And that has nothing to 
do with closing the lid, if USB was a problem you'd think it would happen 
when it was open.)
I only had it fail to suspend (booting back up to the desktop with the 
filesystem horked) exactly once, and that was when I let the battery drop 
down to 0% charged.  (It'll keep going for 15 minutes when it's like that, 
there's a reserve for suspend-to-ram.  That might have been an ACPI problem 
somehow, yet if I'd told it to shutdown it would have (it always does, I've 
done it a lot, yes with the battery at 0%), and presumably ACPI is only being 
used to power the puppy off, the rest should just be a variant of module 
unloading, checkpointing process state, and flushing memory to swap...
