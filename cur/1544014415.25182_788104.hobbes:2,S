We only see the ccache/distcc issue if we have MODVERSIONS
enabled.
So if we introduce a CONFIG option to disable strip of modules
then we will have the double amount of configuration
possibilities.
Today we have with or without MODVERSION.
If we make the stripping configurable then we will have
in addition two different configurations.
The reason to do the .c -> .s -> .o step is to make the
__crc_ symbols local so we can strip them off.
What is the gain/pain ratio here?
Would it be a possibility to drop stripping off the
crc symbols and go back to the ld method that
is more ccache friendly?
We would still benefir from all the other stripping done - no?
