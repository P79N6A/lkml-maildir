AXFS is a XIP file system , compared with linear XIP CRAMFS , it is
better in efficiency and speed .
Anyone is doing this work ? Can you share with me ?
Thanks ,
Currently , I have compiled AXFS_inode.c successfully , and compiling
the AXFS_super.c , I feel that maybe I can be successful .Good luck .
Best Regards,
Bob
