It would be possible with some Makefile hacks. Basically you would need
to objcopy the ACPI object files and rename .text*/.data* to 
a different acpi specific name. Then you can give it an special 
area in the vmlinux.lds and possibly free it.
I agree with you that it's better kept in the kernel.

Hmm, this used to be smaller, no? Perhaps someone going over
bloat-o-meter[1] output to an older version would be useful.
There is probably some low hanging fruit.
