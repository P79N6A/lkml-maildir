Can I request (additionally) a look at remaining calls to {sig,}setjmp() and 
sigprocmask(), like the below one and the one in (IIRC) thread_wait()?
I think that probably some of them are valid because signal handlers modify 
the signal mask, so we may still need to play with it, but:
* I don't remember (I may be wrong) mention of this in the changelog of the 
softints patch,
* you had IIRC doubts on the current code (when I noted thread_wait())
* an analysis of what is correct should end up in a comment somewhere 
describing the results.
I won't have the time to work on this soon, at least not this week, and I 
didn't write the code.
When I'll get time, I'll work on merging RemapFilePages in -mm (I'm reasonably 
near to resend it, but I can't until I've made sure all changelogs are 
up-to-date and clear enough).

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
