In fact there's no difference at all at fork time since the instantiation 
work is defered to page fault time.

As Rik pointed out, the overhead isn't per pte, it's 8 bytes per mapped page 
plus 4 bytes per physical page.
This can be reduced to just 4 bytes per physical page in the case of 
nonshared pages, and the shared case the 8 bytes per mapped page can be 
reduced by various strategies.  Even as it stands it's not too bad.

Yes.  I've proposed a small optimization where each pte_chain link points to 
several ptes, reducing the cache penalty for the pte chain walk.  Improving 
the locality of the pte accesses themselves is not as easy since that would 
require the lru list would need to be in non-random order with respect to 
ptes, and I don't know any simple way to do that.  I also think it doesn't 
matter much since this overhead is incurred only when we are doing heavy 
scanning of the ptes, and we are only doing that when we are under heavy 
memory pressure.  In theory, the cost of the extra cache hits will be
drowned out by the savings from improved page replacement decisions.  Of 
course, this remains to be seen.

It's likely that many of the page tables referring to glibc can be shared as 
well.  This is a somewhat different problem than the lazy instantiation, but 
looks tractable to me.  Without such sharing there are various things that 
can be done to reduce the list maintainance overhead.  Such long lists can be 
special-cased for example, so that you would go to a double-linked list or a 
tree only when sharing exceeds some threshold.

Virtual scanning has a fundamental disadvantage in comparison to reverse 
mapping: there is a large and unpredictable lag between the time a pte's 
accessed bit is transfered to a physical page and when it is queried during 
the physical scan.  Thus, virtual scanning does not scale well, because as 
memory size increases the age of the accessed information in the physical 
page becomes increasingly random.  There is no simple way to partition the 
virtual scan by physical region to reduce this lag.  Though this is far from 
the only problem with virtual scanning, in the long run it's the killer.
