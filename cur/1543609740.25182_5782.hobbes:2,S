"Hardly anyone" includes 100% of the people I know. Not exactly heavy use,
mostly occasional transport of files and for emergency booting. Heck,
_every_ machine I see around me here has a floppy drive, can't just throw
that away because _you_ don't like it. The alternatives are extremely
expensive and so rare as to be almost useless around here.
