Ok, urandom was a bad example. I have my tty logger (ttyrpld.sf.net) which 
moves a lot of data (depends) to userspace. It uses a ring buffer of "fixed" 
size (set at module load time). Apart from that relayfs could use a dynamic 
sized ring buffer, I would not see any need to move it to relayfs, would you?
