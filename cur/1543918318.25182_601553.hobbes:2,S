It seems to me that this function alone is a reason to argue against
using a singly linked list. I know your patch doesn't actually contain
this as a function but it does use the same logic to append to your
lists. Does the overhead of the second pointer that the regular list
head uses outweigh the O(1) insertion and deletion it provides
(especially in your case)? I know domain transitions are rare but why
use something with O(N) insertion? This could be one reason why there
isn't an slist already in list.h
