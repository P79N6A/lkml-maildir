I have seen a few other people report that SATA suspend/resume
works when using Jens's patch.  However, this is done without
the benefit of what the additional ACPI methods provide thru
_GTF and writing those taskfiles, such as:
- enabling write cache
- enabling device power management
- freezing the security password
so even when it "works," those people may be missing some
performance benefits or power savings or security.
In any case, I'm glad to see some discussion of this.
