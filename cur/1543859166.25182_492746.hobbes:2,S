Subject: linus' git repo down?

  for the last couple of days, i've been unable to pull from linus'
2.6 repository.  i consistently get:
$ git pull
fatal: unexpected EOF
Fetch failure: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
No changes.
even after several retries.  i can clone it from scratch, i just can't
update from it.  thoughts?
