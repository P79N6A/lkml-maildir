   We are reading different mans? My man malloc(3) clearly states that 
malloc() can return NULL. (*)
   May I ask you one question? Did you were ever doing once graceful
failure of application under memory pressure? Looks like not.
   I can guess why sendmail allocates memory it never touches - memory
pools. There are situations where you really cannot fail - and memory
allocation failures are really nasty. Do you wanna to lose your e-mails? 
No? So then think twice, while implementing lazy allocators.
   So from my tests I see that by default Linux is not safe. You allocate
memory - malloc() != NULL. Then later you try to write to this memory
and you get killed by oom_killer. What is the point of this? Your
reasoning doesn't sound to me.
   Memory pools used by applications exactly to make grace error
handling under memory pressure - but it looks like this stuff under
Linux gets no testing at all. And default settings could make from
simple bug complete disaster.

   I shall try overcommit_memory == 2 tomorrow and say what I see.
P.S. For example application I have ported right now to kernel space has
a limitiation - it must never ever allocate memory: memory consumption
is known, protocol just have no situation like ENOMEM - it _must_ fail
to initialize on start-up. No - not to being killed by oom_killer in
middle of processing. think carrier grade and/or just good programming
technics.
(*) Great optimization opportunities: remove from all programmes checks 
of the return value if malloc(). As by your words - why not?

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
