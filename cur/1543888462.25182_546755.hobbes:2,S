Running 'make -j' kernel compilation on my test box (Athlon64 X2, 2 SATA drives
with 6 software RAID1 ext3 and reiserfs partitions, 2 GB of RAM) makes it
completely unresponsive.  I can't even move the mouse pointer when it's
running, I can't log to the box from the network etc.
The anticipatory IO scheduler is used.
Greetings,
Rafael
