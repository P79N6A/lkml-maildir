You're not actually saving memory with this change, as __devexit is
resolved to either __exit (i.e. nothing changes) or nothing (i.e. the
code is now always compiled in.) This is a bugfix though as currently
the code may be striped away while the driver still holds a pointer to
it.
Good catch, applied (with a different header comment), thanks.
