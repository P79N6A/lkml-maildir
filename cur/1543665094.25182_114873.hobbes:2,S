We're using %fs enabled glibc (currently with arch_prctl, but I would
like to change that because it's slow)

It's hardcoding the magic fs register in the kernel for once.

I had some code like this for some time - not in prctl, but in set_thread_area,
but I removed it because the selector messing looked too ugly.
But that was before prctl reloaded the selector forcefully to zero.
That was later changed to fix another bug.
Now with it getting reloaded it would make sense to set it in the GDT
too if possible, I agree. I'll implement that.
It will also transparent speed up the glibcs already using arch_prctl.
I like that.
I can do a similar thing in clone. It unfortuately also hardcodes fs there,
but I guess that ugly hack will be needed to get the broken NPTL design for this
to work.
You just have to guarantee from user space that you don't do nasty
things with the selector.

It's already done (set to zero) to not confuse the lazy switch logic.

2.5.64 currently doesn't boot (known issue); 2.5.63 works however.
I'll look into the .64 problems later today and put a fix onto the
usual place when done (
