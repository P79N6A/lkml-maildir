It would be at 0x80000000UL on SH if it weren't for address space area
limitations. The 0x7c000000 - 0x7fffffff space is used for shadowing P4
registers in the virtual address space (area 7) with the MMU and it's a
reserved area without the MMU, so TASK_SIZE is trimmed right before this.
However, I'm not sure that the patch Greg has in this set is sufficient
for the problem described. do_mmap_pgoff() won't allow a > TASK_SIZE
mapping anyways. In the SH case we certainly have address spaces that
can be given user permissions well above TASK_SIZE, area 7 space is used
as a bit of a hack for some of this in the MMU case..
