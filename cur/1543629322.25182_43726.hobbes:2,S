Or any of the Makefile.in files have changed.  Or any of the command
line options have changed.  Or various environment variables have
changed.  Or a target file has been altered outside kbuild control.
Or the compiler has changed.  Or ... the list goes on.
Coding a special case to work out if the existing global makefile can
be reused is horribly error prone.  And it would take just as long as
rebuilding the global makefile from scratch.
