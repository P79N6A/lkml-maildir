I tried yesterday a thud.c load and it did not get a single skip here
either. It is interesting what thud.c can do to latency (let's not talk
about irman because things get really nasty). With a simple `thud 5` the
latency rised to more then one full second, as you can see by the graphs
inside the SOFTRR page. No buffer size can cope with that.
