Yes, Len's advice has me wondering now.  Do I have a dodgy cable? I will have 
to change that tomorrow.
But more info.  The old drive played DVD movies etc. OK, but slowly it became 
worse until I couldn't read any one of them 9 times out of 10.  CD play 
back/burning was OK 100% all the time though - so I guessed the dvd laser 
(whatever it does) was dead - hence why I bought a new one. 
The new drive works perfectly, but for the udma33 issue.  If it was the cable, 
why would it read/burn CD OK, but not DVD sometimes on the old drive?
