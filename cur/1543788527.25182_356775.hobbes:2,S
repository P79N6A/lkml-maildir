Sorry, yes. This tweak should demonstrate what I meant
while true
do
  echo "1" > foo
  echo "2" > bar
  mv bar foo
done

No we're not. I telling you that your open_create is not a solution for
the problems we have with open in NFSv4.
If it doesn't do atomic lookup+open, then I have an unfixable race. Any
"solution" that requires NFS to assume that the dcache will remain
consistent with the server namespace across more than one RPC operation
is prone to races.
OTOH mount/umount races are fixable since they involve only the local
namespace. Just add locking.
