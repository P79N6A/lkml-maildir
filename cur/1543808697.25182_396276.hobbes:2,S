I'm scratching my head over flush_dcache_page() on, say, sparc64.  For
example, the one in fs/direct-io.c.  With this patch, we'll call
flush_dcache_page_impl(), which at least won't crash.  Before the patch I
think we'd just do random stuff.
But I'm not sure that flush_dcache_page(hugetlb tail page) will do the
right thing in aither case?
