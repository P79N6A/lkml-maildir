Thank you for the acknowledge, Matt.

Yes, to accommodate the extra 12 bits for error shifting.

Don't worry, the PAGE_SIZE being divided is unsigned long. So there's
no 64bit division on 32bit CPU :) And we do avoid the division for
the common case of mapcount == 1.

OK, I introduced PSS_ERROR_BITS=12, and some comments for it.
Note that the output unit of 1KB could be the most significant source
of errors :)

Ok, removed it.

PSS(proportional set size) accounting in smaps
The "proportional set size" (PSS) of a process is the count of pages it has in
memory, where each page is divided by the number of processes sharing it. So if
a process has 1000 pages all to itself, and 1000 shared with one other process,
its PSS will be 1500.
               - lwn.net: "ELC: How much memory are applications really using?"
The PSS proposed by Matt Mackall is a very nice metic for measuring an process's
memory footprint. So collect and export it via /proc/<pid>/smaps.
Matt Mackall's pagemap/kpagemap and John Berthels's exmap can also do the job.
They are comprehensive tools. But for PSS, let's do it in the simple way.
