> Have you tried 2.4.21pre?  It may have fixes to handle newer hardware.
I tried the 2.4.21pre4, and it crashes as well, seemingly in the exact
same spot as the other kernels. I also tried 2.5.59, but I couldn't get
it to find the array at all (it does list the IDE channels, though).
Here's a summary of what happens:
  Kernel        Finds IDE?  Finds array?  Finds partitions
  ------        ----------  ------------  ----------------
  2.4.18        No          Yes*          Yes, and boots fine
  2.4.19        Yes         Yes           Crashes when enumerating
  2.4.20        Yes         Yes           Crashes when enumerating
  2.4.21pre4**  Yes         No            No partitions found
  2.4.21pre4*** Yes         Yes           Crashes when enumerating
  2.5.59        Yes         No            No partitions found
* When fed IDE channels on the command line
** With configuration copied from 2.4.20.
*** Enabled the non-ataraid options for Promise FastTrak.
The configuration for 2.4.19--21 should be the same. 2.4.18 is
pre-built version from Debian's boot-floppies. Source for 2.4.21pre4
and 2.5.59 are pristine kernel.org sources. (My 2.5.59 configuration
might have been flawed, however.)
As before, all relevant debugging material may be found at

I could really need some help debugging. I can set up an account on my
machine (I have a cable tv connection), and set up a null modem cable
from the problematic machine if that would be helpful. I don't really
know much about kernel debugging, especially when it crashes before the
system has actually started up.
