I'm working with a (approximately) 2.4.17 kernel from the mips-linux
tree (oss.sgi.com).
I'd like to propose removing the "__init" designation from init_idle in
kernel/sched.c, since this is called from rest_init via cpu_idle. 
Notice that rest_init isn't in an init section, and explicitly mentions
that it's avoiding a race with free_initmem.  In my kernel (an SMP
kernel running on a system with only 1 available CPU), cpu_idle isn't
getting called until after free_initmem().
My CPU is MIPS, but it looks like x86 could experience the same problem.
