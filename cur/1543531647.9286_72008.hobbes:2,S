No. It just confirmed you had the resources to start a process.

First come, first served, if there is contention between them. If both
our processes tried to lock a file for exclusive access, which would
win?

No. This is the point - the kernel does NOT give either process
memory, it gives them both address space. There is plenty of that to
go round. When one then fails to get the memory it is requesting, it
is signalled as a result.

OK, per user resource limits.

(snip race condition)

I accept that there is a race condition. Both processes are trying to
grab the same resource, one will fail, the other will not. The
situation is completely unchanged by imposing resource quotas.
(OK, you could set them low enough to prevent either process running,
but that's worse...)
