Subject: 2.2.9 refuses to boot from floppy

Firstly, I've tried several different known good floppies.
I've an old 486/120, with an unknown I/O card for IDE and floppy
drives.  Currently, I have installed Redhat 6.0, using the default
2.2.5-15 from the bootdisk made during installation. Everything works
more or less ok, except for some irritating packet forwarding problems
(why do some packets simply refuse to be forwarded, and refuse leave a
trace of why they won't be forwarded? Very disconcerting).
I would, however, like to upgrade my kernel.  For whatever reason (I
don't know why), LILO doesn't work.  Somehow, the computer completely
skips the boot sector, or doesn't know how to read it, whatever.  Put
the same hard drive in another computer and it boots fine off of the
currently installed LILO.  On this one, it always complains about a
non-system disk, which is  why I have to use a boot disk.
Now, as I've said, I've tried several floppies in a make bzdisk
operation.  Compiled the kernel both on the computer itself, and on
another computer (and ran rdev to set the root device).  The kernel
loads and uncompresses, and the various drivers are loaded, eth0, pppd
2.3.7, hda {hda1...} all detected.  Finally, the boot sequence reaches
the "Freeing kernel memory..." line, and the computer promptly freezes. 
Complete lockup--keyboard stops responding.
The one time I tried DOS on the system, everything worked fine at
bootup.  Well, as well as DOS can, anyhow.
I would really like to get this problem solved, so that I can move
beyond the stock install.  I'd use LILO off a floppy, but that doesn't
work, either, it seems.  <sigh>
