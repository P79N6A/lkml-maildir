I don't see why it would add any extra logic to your pci code. You only
need to implement simple pmac-specific "FIXUP_EARLY" routine for I/O ASIC.
Something like this:
static void __init fixup_io_asic(struct pci_dev *asic)
{
	struct pci_dev *bridge;
	/* Set up asic->resource[] (using firmware info?) */
	...
	asic->skip_probe = 1;
	/* Also, don't probe parent bridge */
	bridge = asic->bus->self;
	if (bridge && (bridge->class >> 8) == PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_PCI)
		bridge->skip_probe = 1;
}
And you've done with it.
Note that in most cases PCI-PCI bridges can be safely excluded from
pci_read_bases() simply because they have neither regular BARs nor
ROM BAR (even though PCI spec allows that).
