Jes' and Ingo's assertions boil down to the fact that there is probably
a lot of code which does:
	struct foo * p = alloc_somehow(sizeof(foo));
	memset(p, 0, sizeof(foo));
where it should use a little extra clues to know that a full zeroing of
the structure is unnecessary.
Search the archives for Jakub Jelinek's patch yesterday (or the day
before) which applied that logic to some of the signal code and found
significant potential savings.
Matthew.
