My general experience with compiler generated prefetches right now is
pretty poor for kernel type code. Its hard to do it right in the
compiler for complex stuff rather than 'fortran in C' type jobs
We certainly could perl the asm to drop in the right directives if it
became an issue, but there are children on the list so lets worry about
it if it becomes a problem
