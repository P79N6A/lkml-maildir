Correct.

It was.  The sata_via.c driver is absolutely generic except for its PCI 
ID.  I only chose to create a separate driver because I now have docs 
(thanks, VIA), so I can begin programming the SATA-specific registers.
So, here are the 2.4 and 2.6 versions of the VIA SATA support for 
libata, contained in the latest libata update.
2.4 BK: bk://kernel.bkbits.net/jgarzik/atascsi-2.4
2.4 Patch: 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.4/2.4.23-pre1-libata3.patch.bz2
2.6 BK: bk://kernel.bkbits.net/jgarzik/atascsi-2.6
2.6 Patch: 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.6/2.6.0-test4-bk2-libata3.patch.bz2
Changes:
* add VIA SATA driver
* fixes to software reset.
* other fixes
* split scsi-related code into separate file, libata-scsi.c.
* continue work on phy layer
* continue work towards fully async taskfile API:  you call submit_tf(), 
and later on, your callback is called when the taskfile completes or 
times out.   async taskfile API is required for ATAPI and supporting 
more advanced host controllers like Promise or AHCI (SATA2).
* some cleanups
