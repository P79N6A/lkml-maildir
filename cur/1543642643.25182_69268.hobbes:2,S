Well, it migth also _deprove_ that latency, as taking another interrupt is 
a lot more expensive than just walking the list of ISR's on the existing 
irq chain.
Particularly on a P4, taking an interrupt is quite expensive.
Remember: you'd be "improving latency" by taking several interrupts 
instead of taking just one. And usually, if the system is really under so 
much interrupt load that this would be noticeable, you want to try to 
_mitigate_ interrupts instead of adding new ones. 
I think. I'd like to point out that I just have a gut feel for this, so
I'm definitely not trying to say that I absolutely hate the idea and that
it will never happen. But the thing worries me a bit, and I really would 
prefer to have some quantifiable reasons for or against it.
In other words, I kind of understand your concerns, but I've got concerns 
of my own. But nobody will argue against numbers..
