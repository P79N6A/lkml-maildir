Subject: [PATCH] 0/5 PPC64 - make iSeries virtual devices/drivers appear in sysfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Andrew, Linus,
This is the patch I submitted for comment last week broken up a bit.
The purpose of the patch set is to integrate the iSeries virtual device
drivers in the driver infrastructure to allow for fairly reasonable user
mode probing for devices.
For each possible virtual device, there is an entry in /sys/devices/vio
and /sys/bus/vio/devices with the exception of the virtual ethernets where
there is an entry for each virtual lan that is actually configured.  When
the appropriate device driver is loaded (if it is a module), then entries
for actually configured devices appear in
/sys/bus/vio/drivers/<drivername>.  To only create entries for configured
devices in /sys/devices/vio (etc) would require some rework and moving of
the device probing code for each driver.  This may be done in the future.
This patch set is meant to be fairly minimal in order to get user mode
device enumeration.
The patches following are:
	1) update the vio infrastructure so that iSeries can use it. This
patch has only very small changes to the way pSeries works - and then only
internally to vio.c (apart from the renaminf of one routine).
	2) integrate iseries_veth
	3) viodasd
	4) viocd
	5) viotape

As I said, I posted this patch set as a single patch last week.
Unless we have objections, please apply.
