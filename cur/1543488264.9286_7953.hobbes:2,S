I have a dual Pentium II 450Mhz with 128M.  I tested the real-time scheduling on
the kernel 2.2.2 and got unexpected results.  I ran the following test program.  
On a kernel 2.0.36, the process takes all the cpu time on one cpu, but because I
have 2 cpu, the computer sill responds very well.  If I do the same test on an
kernel 2.2.2, the computer reacts like I would have only one cpu.    TOP shows
that the other cpu is 100% idle.   Has someone ever had the same problem?
#include <sched.h>
main()
{
  struct sched_param sparam;
  sparam.sched_priority = 99;
  sched_setscheduler(0,SCHED_FIFO,&sparam);
  
  while(1){}
}
