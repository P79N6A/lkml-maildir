Well, if it's a GPL-friendly license on the document, the contributors should
feel free to change it as needed - that's the point of the GPL.
What it *does* make clear is that the doc was a "work for hire" under
copyright law, and that if there's infringement, it isn't Thomas that's
going to come looking for you, it's Suse Linux GmbH.
