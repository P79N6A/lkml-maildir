Right.

That would be great! Anyone volunterering for the block layer?

There needs to be some work done on that level. But page->private can be 
used for compound pages now which should make this simple to do.

Great!

kmap_atomic does not do anything if we do not use highmem. If we want to 
support highmem with higher order pages then kmap_atomic needs to support 
arbitrary page orders.

I'd be happy if we could make this work soon.

I was surprised too. Seems that multiple people have been preparing for 
the great day when we finally support higher order pages in the page 
cache.
