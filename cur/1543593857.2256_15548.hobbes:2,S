The S/390 guys hit similar issues with the hotplug CPU patch, with
softirqs still pending on the downed CPU.
There are two cases when this happens:
(1) softirq's disabled when the interrupt came in.
(2) softirq scheduled within softirq, such as when networking is
    overloaded (net/core/dev.c's net_rx_action()).
Solving (2) is hard: the choices are to risk livelock (by resetting
the mask inside the softirq loop), or accept that bursty traffic may
have latencies of up to one timer tick.
Either way, we should solve (1) by checking in local_bh_enable() is
fine (despite Dave's reservations, and Alexey's "don't do that unless
you are about to schedule()" is obviously crap).  Then we can drop the
hackish checks inside schedule(), system calls returns and idle loops,
all of which were simply masking this problem.
Rusty.
