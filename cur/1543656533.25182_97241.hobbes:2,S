There does seem to be a problem with the rw_swap_page_sync routine. Perhaps
not on Pavel's machine (:>), but I've experienced painfully slow suspends
too. Performance was helped immensely by applying a concept that I'll credit
Lyle Seaman for - unrolling rw_swap_page_sync and submitting all the IO for
pages then looping again and waiting on each sync. I found with writing 7000
or so pages (a suspend from init S) that something gets triggered to force
the sync about every 3900 pages anyway.

Nigel
