	[Venkatesh Ramamurthy]  You are getting my point exactly. This was
my argument from the first, we should have a efficient mechanism to mount
partitions

	[Venkatesh Ramamurthy]  If the OS detects two partitions of the same
name , either dont mount both , but display an error  (or) mount the first
one it finds ( this is not a good idea but)
