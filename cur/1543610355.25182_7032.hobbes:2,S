If I got this right, "acpi=off" fixes the problem using a kernel which
otherwise shows the problem. If so, this clearly indicates that ACPI is
the culprit, or, more precisely, probably an _INI method which is executed
by the ACPI interpreter at boot time. Can you mail me (privately) a copy
of your DSDT (cat /proc/acpi/dsdt > file), that's a table provided by the
ACPI BIOS.

That's weird enough, somethings seems wrong with your PCI enumeration. 
Can you recompile your kernel with #define DEBUG instead of #undef DEBUG 
in drivers/pci/pci.c and arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.h? Then please send the 
boot messages again.
