I think it is very important to only include critical fixes at this
stage in the release cycle, especially in a kernel where we are actively
looking for a possible bug.
I also think that patch (#3) should be integrated in 2.4.20preX, along
with the iput deadlock fix like Oleg did for 2.5.  It will clean the
code with fewer silly changes, and let us avoid rediffing the iput
deadlock fix against the new stuff.
