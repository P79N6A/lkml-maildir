We have now comparison data for DBT-2 (readprofile included) from
multiple kernels. To provide a quick comparison for those not
familiar with DBT-2, we've compared the results, using 2.5.65 stock
as the baseline (bigger is better).
                        Score           Score
Kernel                  Cached          Non-Cached
2.5.65 base             100 (baseline)  100
2.5.65-mjb2 HZ=100      90.95           99.26
2.5.65-mjb2 HZ=1000     102.38          99.92
2.5.65-osdl1            101.69          99.89
2.5.64-osdl1            104.16          99.67
HZ is defined as 1000 in the base and osdl1 kernels. mjb2 kernel uses
Andrew Morton / Dave Hansen patch making HZ a config option of
100 Hz or 1000 Hz).  Also we reversed out the 400-shpte patch.
Link to .config, readprofiles, metric info, raw data:

Guided tour:
At the top of the screen, you will see a row that includes the .config
and the readprofile data for each kernel tested.
Next is the list of runs of each type, the average metric (Green
line) bigger numbers are better. The first set of these is the
cached workload case, second is non-cached.
Click on "Raw data" for the vmstat, iostat raw info from each run of
that kernel and workload type.
Just some things noticed looking at the vmstat plotted data:
Notible difference in processes waiting for run time, all 2.5.65
are high relative to 2.5.64(the last frame) for the cached case
(first row of frames) in these plots:

Of course, interrupts are down for the HZ=100 case (second frame,
both rows):

Context switches per second slightly down to for HZ=100:

Moving on to 2.5.66 to escape problems with "sleep".
