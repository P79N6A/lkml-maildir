I cannot claim any knowledge of the TCP code (and your tcpdump), but
with regards to this net driver, there is a known problem where it stops
receiving packets.
	ifdown eth0 ; ifup eth0
seems to cure this problem if you don't want to wait 2 hours :)
Does this occur in the latest 2.3.x 8139too driver?
Does this occur in Becker's latest test rtl8139 driver?
This problem seems easily reproduced by ping-flooding the machine in
question.
If you do test with the 8139too driver, sending me 'working' and 'dead'
snapshots of the 8139 registers would be awesome.  You can get these
from
	rtl8139-diag -mmmaaavvvf
