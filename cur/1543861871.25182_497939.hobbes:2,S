Hello,
What is the current status of the bug where modifications to file
contents made via mmap fail to update mtime of the file?
This was discussed a few months ago in this thread:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/17/138
where patches have been posted, but it seems that no final solution
has been agreed on and applied to the kernel tree.  Updating ctime
and mtime appears to be required by the standard:
  
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/mmap.html
  The st_ctime and st_mtime fields of a file that is mapped with
  MAP_SHARED and PROT_WRITE shall be marked for update at some point
  in the interval between a write reference to the mapped region and
  the next call to msync() with MS_ASYNC or MS_SYNC for that portion
  of the file by any process.
and failing to do it can lead to potential data loss as well, if
modified files are not backed up (I'm seeing the problem with Samba
tdb files not being backed up by rsnapshot, for example).
Thanks,
Marek
