Well, "sleep" means we're not using CPU at all; we're waiting for
something.  Remember, "load average" isn't purely a CPU measure.
Historically, state D has meant "fast" i/o--reading from disk or tape,
where the result is supposed to be available very soon and it's not
worth doing the extra housekeeping to sleep interruptibly.  Processes
aren't supposed to sit in state D for more than a fraction of a
second.  This being the case, Unix has always factored state D
processes into the load average.  For your distinction to work, there
would have to be an extra flag somewhere saying "I'm in state D, but
don't factor me into the load average", with corresponding code in the
load average calculation routine to honor the flag.  Doable, but not
useful up to now, and only (possibly) worth doing if we get more
threads like the loop driver that sit in D state for a long time. 
This is the first example I've seen in Linux of something sitting in
state D for a long time on purpose.  I agree that IMHO it's not ideal
(for the reason you outline below, mainly).

Yup. 
The whole Sendmail/load average thing needs careful thought anyway
when setting up a production system--a load average of 8 on an 8-way
system, for example, is a much lighter load than a load of 8 on a
single-CPU machine.
