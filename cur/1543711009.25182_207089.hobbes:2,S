Well, the direction makes the difference between a flush and an
invalidation ;)

No, flush on TO_DEVICE and BIDIRECTIONAL, invalidate on FROM_DEVICE,
it's less expensive to invalidate than flush in that case, since we
don't care about writing to real memory whatever junk the cache
contained for this area.
