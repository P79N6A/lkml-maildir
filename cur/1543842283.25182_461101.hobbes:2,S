it's correct, since with -ffreestanding gcc no longer has the right to 
assume it had a full libc available.
Yes, -ffreestanding disables gcc builtins, but the correct fix for this 
issue is not to remove -ffreestanding, but to check where we want to use 
gcc builtins and enable them explicitely.
This takes more time than the quick'n'dirty patch that removed 
-ffreestanding, but it does it right (and we might perhaps get rid of 
things like include/asm-i386/string.h).
