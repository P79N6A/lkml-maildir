Probably what is happening is that in the middle of the night,
your distribution runs a cron job like "slocate" or "medusa"
which scans through your hard drive.  Other distros do security
checks for world-writable files and many other things...
This heavy read activity fills up a lot of buffers and causes 
your apps to be swapped out.
