FWIW, here's a patch that does that. It also fixes a typo ("IA/32" should
be "IA-32") and clarifies that the Documentation/Changes comments about gcc
versions apply mainly to x86.
If I made any mistakes, please correct me...

+The recommended compiler for the kernel is egcs 1.1.2 (gcc 2.91.66), and it

+compile kernel 2.4 with this version of gcc will most likely result in a
+compilation error or in a miscompiled kernel.
 
 In addition, please pay attention to compiler optimization.  Anything
 greater than -O2 may not be wise.  Similarly, if you choose to use gcc-2.95
