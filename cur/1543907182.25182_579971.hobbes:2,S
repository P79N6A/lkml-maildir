It's just a wrapper around the kernel's suspend code that allows you to restore
the state of the graphics by running some additional code in real mode from
the user space.

With "--vbe_mode" s2ram saves the VBE mode setting before the suspend and sets
it to the same value after the resume.  Thus, it seems that the VBE mode
setting was previously preserved across the suspend/resume cycle and now it is
not.
Running s2ram with "--acpi_sleep 1" is equivalent to echoing 1 to
/proc/sys/kernel/acpi_video_flags before the suspend.

The real mode code executed during resume is in
arch/x86_64/kernel/acpi/wakeup.S or in arch/i386/kernel/acpi/wakeup.S ,
depending on the architecture.
