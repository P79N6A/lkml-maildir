Amazing technology, run XP on a 256 bit 6.8GHz protrietary quantum CPU, 
by breaking the words into 64 bit pieces and passing them to XP via a 
"RAM packet counter" device.
And they run four copies of XP at once, too, and you don't need to boot 
them, they run instantly because... the web page says so?
I assume this is a joke, a scam would have prices ;-)
