Since a long time is from 2.5.5x roughly.
The SUBDIRS= notation is not intuitive, and the M= notation follow
the other similar options: O=, C=.
SUBDIRS will be kept, but warned for in 2.7. Removed when 2.8 opens or similar.
So I see no breakage here.

If the solution becomes messy then I will just drop it.
I do not see a big need here anyway.
It will also create troubles: Can we modify .config etc.

I know - but the incentive here was to seperate stuff out that does not
belong in a Kbuild makefile.
In 2.7 I may write a simple parser to create one single big Makefile,
and then it will be good to have very simple Makefiles only.

You already convinced me about the usefullness of the modversions file.
Can you try to make a patch that _only_ incorporate the modversions
functionality. This we could ask Andrew to apply when reviewed.
See it as first step.
Then I will try to work out something for the functionality outlined
before.

Actually we agree, I just did not think of chowing the files/dirs to 
catch the problems.
