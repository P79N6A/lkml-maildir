Nice, yet one more variable to the equation ;). And I thought I could rule
out kernel bugs by reproducing this on supposedly stable kernel (the 2.2.20
I used had all sort of patches in it; ide, e2compr and raid to name the
largest ones.)
This could be a sync_page_buffers() bug, but what puzzles me is that I can
reproduce the oopses on 2.2 as well (although they can of course be
different oopses). 
Also, I'm seeing ide and network corruption that would very much point to
pci transfer corruption. Of course, it can be that the oopses are not caused
by that.

Yep.
