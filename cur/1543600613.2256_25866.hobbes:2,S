Did some more testing this A.M.
Soft Mount:
    Took me several tries -- had to run a tiobench on the server side to
make for some I/O contention.  Was able to get EIO error (since this is Sat
the system was pretty idle).
Hard Mount:
    Unable to reproduce even though 10 second timeouts could be seen.
Soft Mount (retrans=5)
    Unable to reproduce
Could be the interaction with ext3 where I/O gets bound up a while.  Just
long enough to trigger the timeouts for a soft mount.
