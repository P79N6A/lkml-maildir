It was originally deleted but later readded when the MTRR code was merged together.
That's because of i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/state.c which is compiled on x86-64 too.
If you can move that code into cyrix.c it can be removed. Might be a good opportunity
to clean this up.

I would need an patch against the current ff tree that doesn't break x86-64.
