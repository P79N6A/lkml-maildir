The i860 at least has a Pentium MMU. No problem _there_.
Fault handling is a problem. Some people say you can't really
recover from some faults. I've also heard that it can be done
in 5000 lines of assembly. (did the first group wimp out or did
the second group miss some cases?)
IEEE math needs assistance from a fault handler since the chip
doesn't support denormals. If the fault happens in pipelined
double-instruction mode you have a serious problem.
The i960 is a totally different beast AFAIK.
