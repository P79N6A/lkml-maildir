We will do some measurements with this but based on a large number
of measurements that Kiran had done earlier, we can see a couple of things -
1. Even though a percpu scheme using pointer arithmatic has one less memory
   reference, the globally shared offset table is often in the cache
   and therefore pointer arithmatic offers no added advantage.
2. Increased sharing of cacheline helps by reducing associativity misses.
   We see this by comparing an interlaced allocator where only same
   sized objects share blocks vs. the current static allocator. Sharing of
   blocks by differently sized objects also allow cache lines to be
   kept warm as more subsystems in the kernel access them.
Considering these results, this allocator seems to be a step in the right
direction.
Thanks
