Hi Nigel,
That's what I thought too at first. But I guess there could be other
users of these async functions than the initcalls.
It looks like out of order workqueues that can synchronize themselves.
It seems a bit more costly than workqueues (since the concept comes along
a loop of creation/destroying of several threads) but more efficient for the
same reason as the number of active threads adapts to the number of CPU and jobs to perform.
The purpose is not the same. But I guess it's more reliable
than workqueues for pathes that require mutiple parallel jobs which need
to locally synchronize on critical pathes.
