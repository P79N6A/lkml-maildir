   Hello! Ive tested kernel 2.2.3 with ac3 patches from Alan Cox as a nfs
server for SGI & IBM Aix workstations. I found some problems that you may
recognize or not. 
   a) A little offtopic. Knfsd 1.2 doesnt compile in a Redhat 5.2
installation with upgrades to kernel 2.2.3 and some packages, following
Redhats document on the subject. I resorted to getting
knfsd-981204-3.i386.rpm and knfsd-clients-981204-3.i386.rpm from
Startbuck.  I also upgraded to glibc-2.1-0.990311.i386.rpm from the same
Startbuck distribution. (Btw, does anyone have a binary rpm package for
Knfsd 1.2?) 
   b) Locking has been working ok for sometime. Even pine works, using a
nfs mounted mail spool, even though i get log messages like
	Mar 22 14:12:35 jerry kernel: fh_verify: mail/something permission
	failure,acc=4, error=218103808
   c) Record locking doesnt work, i dont know if it is not supposed to. I
tried to used SGI mailtool (zmail), and it complain the system didnt
support record locking. 
   d) SGI (Irix 5.3 & 6.2) & IBM workstations (Aix 4.1.2) seem to work. 
The minor problem is that while with kernels 2.0.X you didnt need to force
nfs v2, now you have to. The version reported to the workstations seems to
be v2.2, something they are not aware of. 
   e) Some IBM workstations (Aix 4.3 in this case) work. Other, exactly
the same model, OS version and PTF (patch) levels, dont,
with errors like "The file access permissions do not allow the specified
action" and the following in the nfs server: "jerry mountd[337]: getfh
failed: Operation not permitted". I will investigate this further.
If anyone wants help testing some NFS stuff in the pool of
Sgi and Ibm workstations i have, just send me a note, i will be more than
happy to help.
Best regards,
Rui
