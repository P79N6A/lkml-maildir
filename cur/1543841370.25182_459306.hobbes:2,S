I still think this will need some better filters to be useful. At least
a optional uid filter perhaps (make sure to handle the interrupt case
correctly, interrupts don't belong to the uid) , and perhaps an option to only 
fail GFP_ATOMIC.
With arbitary failing the system will just be unusable, right? Or would
you run some system you use this way? @)
Another possibility would be to look up __builtin_return_address(0) in 
the module table and allow failing only for a specific module.
