Hello All....pardon my ignorance, but I'm hoping someone can clarify
something for me. 
The host is a Dell 2300 with on-board aic7880 chips and two 450MHz Intel
CPU's running v2.2.11 with the tcp.diif and new sg2136 patches.
I'm using an Inquiry command to look at the scsi generic devices on the host
and the processor is coming up as an /dev/sg"x" device.
Why is that?  Also, there are two CPU's in the host, but only one shows up
as a generic device.
Is there a corresponding block device for the processor?
Thanks!
Heather
