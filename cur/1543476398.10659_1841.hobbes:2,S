 This might explain how I managed to corrupt the FAT file system on 
compact fash card.
 I use a Laptop running RH 5.2 linux to read the flash cards from my
camera. I have a 16meg card and a 4 Meg card. I mount the flash cards
read only, I delete the picture files back on the camera.
 Well recently I ejected the 16meg card and inserted the 4meg card
with out umounting the device first. The system got a little upset
when I tried to list the directory, with all sorts of errors. Then
I realised my error and removed the card and umounted the file
system. However the 4 meg card's FAT file system was rather worse 
for wear afterward, and I lost several unsaved photos as a result.
 I for one was rather confused how a 'disk' mounted read only appeared
to be modified by the system.
(The flash cards emulate an ATA harddisk - Linux/PCMCIA Card Services
treat them like hard disks...)
