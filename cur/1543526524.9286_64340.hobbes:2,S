The eepro driver is very broken, or more exactly, the eepro card is very
broken, and the driver has not been able to compensate this fully.
2.2.15preX has a modified eepro100.c which solved some of our major problems
with it.
We still see intermittent crashes however on boards with eepro and aic7xxx.
