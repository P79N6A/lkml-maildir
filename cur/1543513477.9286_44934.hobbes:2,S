OK, I understand now that these datagrams are not standard. Unfortunately
I do have to cope with an existing device where it is rather difficult
to change the firmware, so I would probably need to patch the kernel
locally to allow for this standards violation. Does anybody have an idea
where in the kernel source I could find this check?
