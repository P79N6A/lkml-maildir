Hi Kernel Developers,
I have been trying to get this Texas Instruments PCI1410 PC card Cardbus
Controller to work in a l440gx+ based SMP system. However whenever pcmcia
tries to start I get the following
* Starting pcmcia...
cardmgr[5854]: no sockets found!
 * cardmgr failed to start.  Make sure that you have PCMCIA
 * modules built or support compiled into the kernel
A look in the system log reveals the following
Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
PCI: Device 02:04.0 not available because of resource collisions
This error occurs with both 2.5.66 and 2.5.67. I submitted this query to
David Hinds on the PCMCIA forum and he suggested that I should bring this
to you guys.
I also recieved similar errors under 2.4.20. This kernel was patched with
the xfs patches from SGI. Ihave tried this with both the in-kernel pcmcia
and the drivers from the the pcmcia-cs package but the same is always
recieved.
What other information do you need? I'm afraid I'm not really a programmer
and the insides of the kernel are a bit beyond me.
Anyway any help would be greatly appreciated.
Cheers
iain
