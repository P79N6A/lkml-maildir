Frank, thanks for the tip about 2.6.20 being good, it gave me a nice place 
to start bisecting from.
Thomas, Ingo,
Regarding the issue described above that Frank and I are having, I've 
narrowed it down to commit e9e2cdb4[1]: [PATCH] clockevents: i386 drivers
About our systems:
  Averatec 2370/2371 Laptop
    AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-50/TL-52
    nVidia MCP51 chipset
Here a small matrix of my tests:
2.6.20.15 SMP		: OK
2.6.21.5 SMP		: hang
2.6.21.5 UP w/o APIC	: OK
2.6.22.1 UP		: hang
2.6.22.1 UP w/o IO-APIC	: hang
2.6.22.1 UP w/o APIC	: OK
2.6.22.1 SMP		: hang
2.6.22.1 SMP w/o ACPI	: OK
Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide to help.
thanks!
