If it causes the conditional jump to become a long one instead of a byte 
offset one, it's actually a pessimisation for no gain (yes, it might give 
better cache density _if_ the function that is linked after the current 
one is cache-dense with the function in question and _if_ the unlikely 
sequence is really really unlikely, but that's two fairly big ifs).
So I'm not at all convinced of the feature (or maybe gcc actually does the 
right thing, and the reason you can't reproduce it is because gcc is being 
understandably reluctant to use the other section).
Basically, there's "biased one way", "unlikely", and there's "practically 
never happens". And even the "practically never" case will probably be 
better off with the unlikely case close-by, if it means that the likely 
case can use a short branch.
