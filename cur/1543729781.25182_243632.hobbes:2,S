The question then becomes - how many percent of devices in use need 
fixes to work?
A simple program with _no_ fixes, that works with correct devices only 
might not be that hard.
After it becomes popular people simply take care to buy working 
burners.  The old broken
tend to get upgraded after a while, or they can be used with the old 
cdrecord.

Take one thing at a time.  If you want to try this, start writing a 
program that works well
with your particular burner.  Chances are it'll work with many others 
too.  And then you
get patches from people who have other equipment.  You won't need to 
have everything
yourself.

:-) This goes for all open source.  I don't think it'll happen though. :-/
