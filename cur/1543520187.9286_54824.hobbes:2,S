No. I can run two window managers on one PC even without remote X server
(with two local X servers :-). I never tried to use NCD package but I
used X terminals and was able to get full gnome/snlightenment desktop there.

It's not so. You CAN run more then one window manager instances. I think
NCD has some built-in windows manager and so you can not use your own window
manager (like Enlightenment) then. You can start GNOME panel and such, though
(just fire xterm and start all gnome goodies from there).

God knows. I'm know nothing about Winblows X servers.

Nope.
