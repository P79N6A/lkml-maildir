The most appropriate answer is: "cause you don't want to reinvent the
wheel". In order to get full SATA support, you only need to write a
host driver, libata takes care of the gory details.

You don't want to use a 2.4 kernel on ARM, especially not when you're
using new hardware. 2.4 is development is dead, everybody has moved to
2.6.
