Subject: 2.6: USB Storage hangs machine on bootup for ~2 minutes

I am running FC3 on a AMD64 laptop. The laptop has 3 USB ports. If I
attach any usb-storage device (Sandisk Cruiser usb drive, iPod, Maxtor
external drive etc.) the kernel hangs while booting. The hang occurs
shortly after the usb-storage module is loaded. The machine does not
respond to anything other than the power button. This hang lasts for
about 2 minutes after which boot resumes and goes on fine. 
When it is hung, the usb storage devices are not being accessed - the
iPOD for e.g does not show the Do not Disconnect sign when it is hung -
it shows that after the boot resumes. Might have something to do with
the recent "Waiting for device to settle" change in usb-storage?

The boot goes on without a hang if there are no usb-storage devices
attached to the system. (USB mouse is fine for example, so the hang
happens only in case of usb-storage devices.)
PS - This bug was also reported to Redhat Bugzilla some time ago - I
haven't got any feedback so far.
