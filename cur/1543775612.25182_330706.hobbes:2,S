Well, I think this is it.  The drive is actually offering IU and QAS.
That's fun; I've never seen a u160 drive that could do those before.
Although the aic7xxx driver is apparently coded to allow this, it looks
like the code paths have never been exercised.
So, although I think this patch will fix up the first error, there's
probably a long line behind it ...
