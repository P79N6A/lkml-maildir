Look at 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.2_arca3.gz
I heavily fixed all races of array.c some day after 2.2.1 is been
released.

I really dubit it's the cause of the problem. I instead thing that some
(SMP) race in af_unix.c or garbage.c is corrupting memory (or that Michael
is getting hw problems...). When I'll be able to reproduce the crash here
I'll can tell you more... ;). If somebody has test-suite to reproduce the
crash, please let me know.

unix_gc should be recalled only at unix-socket destruction if I understand
well the code...

AFIK Tomasz was able to reproduce the panic in 2.2.2 and is the first one
that reported the problem to me.
Tomasz, could you try out the patches on the list (you can find them in
the thread with this subject), precisely the second patch from Alexander +
my cleanup over it and try if you'll get machine lockups as the other guy
is getting frequently? The patch should fix the panic problem of the unix
garbage collector.
Thanks.
