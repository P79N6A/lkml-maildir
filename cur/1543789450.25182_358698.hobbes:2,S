Sorry for the "deafening silence" on fs-devel. I was trying to see
what exactly I need and how to combine with what you are trying to
do, before I reply. Unfortunately, I don't understand your lock
inversion problem well enough :(
I was looking at ext3 pagelock, trasaction ordering. I wanted
a way to reverse the ordering to support writepages() cleanly.
I guess what you are proposing could be used (in a weird way) to
that, except that I need the support in different places (callers
of writepage, writepages). BTW, I wasn't comfortable touching VFS
locking just of ext3 purpose :(
Thanks,
Badari
