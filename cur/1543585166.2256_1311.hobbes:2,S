Sounds like the only thing you haven't swapped out of your machine is the
ram/cpu.
It could very well be your ram (I don't suspect the cpu). If you can, try a
different stick of ram.

Subject: [OT] how to catch HW fault
Hi,
I'm getting mad because of random freezes of my system. Linux-2.2.19pre7
on MSI 694D dual PIII(677MHz) 128 MB, no OC. I tried to isolate the
problem with replacing cards (S3 video, 3com 59X, ES1373 and
AIC7xxx) didn't solve anything. Even in initlevel 1 with only a videocard
the freeze happens. It is a total lockup, no SYSRQ , no ping from network,
nothing in the logs. A freeze may happen 4 times in a hour or once in 2
weeks. I have the same mobo and PIII's at home without the slightest
problems. Who knows of a suitable diagnostics to track this down?
regards
Kees
