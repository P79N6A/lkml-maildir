Without me knowing every single detail of this matter, just try to hold a 
mutex over function calls in the BSD kernel. While you can acquire a mutex 
(=spinlock) (local to the module implementing the chardev) in e.g. the 
open() routine of a chardev in Linux, and release it upon close(), you'll 
get a segfault on BSD. Ok, Linux got nothing to do with BSD, but that's 
what I remember from porting some code, and it resembles what is discussed 
above.
