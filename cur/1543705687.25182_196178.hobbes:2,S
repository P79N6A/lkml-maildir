Amit has started at least the third activity--he has split much of kgdb
into arch and generic bits.
Could you elaborate a little on the first two?
What major kinds of cleanup are we talking about?  Style issues?
What features (or classes of features) do you find excessive?  Would
it be sufficient to add a few config items to control subfeatures
of kgdb?
These are not idle questions.  If the amount of work to get it ready
for acceptance is tractable, I know a company that may be willing to
pay to have the work done.
