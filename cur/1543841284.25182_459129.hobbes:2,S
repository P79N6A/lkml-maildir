Having had a dig I would concur that we should add the "hlt" back. The
cases I can find are 386/486 "hangs if hlt executed" bugs, mostly
unresolved/chipset problems and a "hlt during IDE DMA hangs the box" bug
we work around on the Cyrix CS5510.
That said for a PIV at least "hlt" really makes little difference to the
power burn
