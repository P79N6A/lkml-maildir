is there a way to dynamically change the limit : kernel: ip_conntrack:
maximum limit of 16384 entries exceeded ?
grepping in the documentation didn't tell much here.
either a newssus scan or a weird ftp server I tried to connect to,
caused the table to fill pretty fast and all other connections stopped
for a short time.
the entries are similar btw in /proc/net/ip_conntrack :
tcp      6 425335 ESTABLISHED src=203.45.72.96 dst=203.45.72.96
sport=28480 dport=21 [UNREPLIED] src=203.45.72.96 dst=203.45.72.96
sport=21 dport=28480 use=1
the source and dest are always the same. weird. currently 15443
entries.
