   I can think of one good reason to up the version number to 3.0;
   if parts of the interface have been broken (I'm thinking about
   pty major numbers here; If other things have changed, it's even
   more of a reason) a major number change at least gives a hint
   that "Hey!  You'll have to remake the *ENTIRE* world if you want
   to upgrade to this system."

   Actually it didn't -- I was running elf-based binaries with 1.2.13
   and for several years the extent of the changes I did for a 2.0.x
   kernel was just that -- I booted with a 2.0.x kernel instead of
   1.2.13 and ignored the stupid flock messages.  Internally, 2.0.x
   may have been massively redone, but the published interfaces stayed
   close enough to 1.2.13 so that it was an incremental upgrade.

                  \/                                   system to fit it.
