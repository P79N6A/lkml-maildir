The CRIS architecture is stable and supported by Axis Communications 
officially in 2.4, but the 2.6 port is work-in-progress, thus you could 
expect problems building it from the vanilla kernel source. It works 
in-house on 2.6, but perhaps all patches have not trickled out to the 
official kernel yet (although they should have I think, so it's good that 
you mention stuff like this).
In the meantime, I would recommend using 2.4 if you want to compile a CRIS 
kernel.
