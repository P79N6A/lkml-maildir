Yep.

Yes, one page. After running lilo, there are 4k diry, running sync
doesn't get it below 4k. Only flushb /dev/hda does (or waiting several
minutes).
If you're interested, I've put an annotated version of
( cat /proc/meminfo; lilo; cat /proc/meminfo; sync; cat /proc/meminfo;
flushb /dev/hda; cat /proc/meminfo ) | buffer > meminfo.out.txt
on my web space: 
http://www.saout.de/files/meminfo.out.txt
(the kernel used was 2.5.70-mm7 with some unrelated patches backed out)
BTW: I found out that now strace lilo freezes the machine...
