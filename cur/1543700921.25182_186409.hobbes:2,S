OK, so if I understand you correctly you are against bloating the kernel by
duplicating hotplug handler, not against the basic idea that kernel should
not call userspace unless its ready. Your wish is my command! 
I changed the code a bit and split it into 2 patches for easier consumption.
The first patch takes care of resource deallocation issues, the second one
deals with hotplug. Firmware hotplug now uses the standard hotplug handler 
(I had to make it public) and as you can see it costs 5 extra lines of C code
(not counting one blank line) in firmware_class.c, hardly a bloat.
