Linus,
 below is a patch for 2.4.0-test that adds documentation for
 ll_rw_block and generic_make_request.  It also corrects a type error
 in a printk call.
 I would really like to change a couple of names in the file:
  "generic_make_request" would sound much better as "raw_rw_block".
    that would highlight it's similarity to ll_rw_block, and would
    remove the "generic" which seems to imply that it is possible to
    replace it with a specific_make_request - which is wrong.
 also
   "__make_request" would sound much better as elevator_make_request, as
     that is more descriptive of what it does.  Also __foo() normally is
     a special (e.g. no locking) case of foo(), but that is not the
     case here.
 Would you accept such as patch at this stage?

+ * @bh:  The buffer head describing the location in memory and on the device.
+ *
+ * generic_make_request() is used to make I/O requests of block
+ * devices. It is passed a &struct buffer_head and a &rw value.  The
+ * %READ and %WRITE options are (hopefully) obvious in meaning.  The
+ * %READA value means that a read is required, but that the driver is
+ * free to fail the request if, for example, it cannot get needed
+ * resources immediately.
+ *
+ * generic_make_request() does not return any status.  The
+ * success/failure status of the request, along with notification of
+ * completion, is delivered asynchronously through the bh->b_end_io
+ * function described (one day) else where.
+ *
+ * The caller of generic_make_request must make sure that b_page,
+ * b_addr, b_size are set to describe the memory buffer, that b_rdev
+ * and b_rsector are set to describe the device address, and the
+ * b_end_io and optionally b_private are set to describe how
+ * completion notification should be signaled.  BH_Mapped should also
+ * be set (to confirm that b_dev and b_blocknr are valid).
+ *
+ * generic_make_request and the drivers it calls may use b_reqnext,
+ * and may change b_rdev and b_rsector.  So the values of these fields
+ * should NOT be depended on after the call to generic_make_request.
+ * Because of this, the caller should record the device address
+ * information in b_dev and b_blocknr.
+ *
+ * Apart from those fields mentioned above, no other fields, and in
+ * particular, no other flags, are changed by generic_make_request or
+ * any lower level drivers.

+ * @nr: number of &struct buffer_heads in the array
+ * @bhs: array of pointers to &struct buffer_head

+ *
+ * This function provides extra functionality that is not in

+ * cache or page cache.  In particular it drops any buffer that it
+ * cannot get a lock on (with the BH_Lock state bit), any buffer that
+ * appears to be clean when doing a write request, and any buffer that
+ * appears to be up-to-date when doing read request.  Further it marks
+ * as clean buffers that are processed for writing (the buffer cache
+ * wont assume that they are actually clean until the buffer gets
+ * unlocked).
+ *
+ * ll_rw_block sets the b_rdev and b_rsector for generic_make_request
+ * based on the values in b_dev and b_blocknr.  It assumes that
+ * b_blocknr is in multiples of b_size bytes (b_rsector must always be
+ * in multiples of 512bytes).
+ *
+ * The comments in the documentation for generic_make_request() about
+ * what fields need to be set up apply to ll_rw_block as well.
