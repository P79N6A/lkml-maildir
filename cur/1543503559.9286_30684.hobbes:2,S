Available bandwidth, or maximum bandwidth you're getting through
your connection?  If you are only getting 14.4k through a 56k
modem period, then your bandwidth is 14.4k regardless of what
modem you have.
If you connect at a certain speed, and the modem does not
fall-back to a slower speed, then you'll get that much bandwidth
avail to PPP/TCP/IP...
