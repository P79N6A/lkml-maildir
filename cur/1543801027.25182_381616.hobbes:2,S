Except perhaps userspace passing invalid values down to drivers in
pm_message_t.event?

We want _common_ values, anyway. So, we do not want "D0", "D1", "D2",
"D3hot" in PCI cases. We probably want "on", "D1", "D2", "suspend",
and I'm not sure about those "D1" and "D2" parts. Userspace should not
have to know about details, it will mostly use "on"/"suspend" anyway.

I asked for an example.
