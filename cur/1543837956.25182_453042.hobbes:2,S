This symbol name has nothing to do with its purpose.  The entire area of 
code you are modifying could be described as having something to do with 
'memalloc'.
GFP_EMERGENCY or GFP_USE_RESERVES or somesuch would be a far better 
symbol name.
I recognize that is matches with GFP_NOMEMALLOC, but that doesn't change 
the situation anyway.  In fact, a cleanup patch to rename GFP_NOMEMALLOC 
would be nice.
