Hi,
FiSC founds a potential error on JFS (Linux 2.6.11) where fsync doesn't
properly flushes out file data.  Crash after this fsync causes data loss.
The test case can be found at 
http://fisc.stanford.edu/bug9/crash.c
To reproduce it, download and compile crash.c, and run it on a fresh jfs
partition.  File /mnt/sbd0/0006/0010/0029/0033 should contain
-23,-69,101,-119, However, the crash-recovered version contains all 0s.
Please let me know if you need more information.
As usual, confirmations/clarifications are appreciated,
-Junfeng
