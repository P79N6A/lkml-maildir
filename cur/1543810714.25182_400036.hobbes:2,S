I have to disagree somewhat violently to that statement, I'm afraid :-)
At least for me, it's pretty much a requirement that I can put eg
2.6.18-rc2 on an enterprise install. It's a must to debug problems -
both ways, actually, testing both a new rc kernel on that enterprise
distro but also putting a vanilla kernel on the enterprise distro to
test something that fails with the distro kernel.
I'd absolutely hate if we got into a situation where you couldn't just
put a new vanilla kernel on SLESx. Calling it a complete solution to
just sounds like an excuse for breaking things that we don't have to.
Please lets not make things so fragile!

Everything doesn't fit into those two boxes.
