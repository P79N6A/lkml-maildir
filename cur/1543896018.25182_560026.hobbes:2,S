Building on the per BDI patches, how about integrating feedback from the
full-ness of device queues. That is, when we are happily doing IO and we
cannot possibly saturate the active devices (as measured by their queue
never reaching 75%?) then we can safely increase the total dirty limit.
OTOH, when even with the per BDI dirty limit the device queue is
constantly saturated (contended) we ought to lower the total dirty
limit.
Lots of detail here to work out, but does this sound workable?
