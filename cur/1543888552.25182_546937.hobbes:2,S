early_printk support on x86 platform
the patch was started by Eric, and I used it in LinuxBIOS, and added
some timeout etc.
also make it consistent to latest tree about relocated kernel feature.
include three part
1. x86_64: early init pgt for fix virtual addr in head.S, so can use
set_fixmap before setup_arch.
2. i386: early init pgt for fix virtual addr in head.S, so can use
set_fixmap before setup_arch.
3. changes in early_printk for early debug port support.
It could be good material for 2.6.23.
We may need 1 for earlycon support for mmio type 8250 to use fix
virtual address.
