 This is what I plan to use:
 int request_firmware_nowait (
              struct module *module,
              const char *name, const char *device, void *context,
              void (*cont)(const struct firmware *fw, void *context));
 Working code should be available later today.

 In this case, hotplug gets called automatically by the device model, and
 there is no way to get the return value of the hotplug run.
 If I get any good feedback on it, I'll try to make that return value
 available, in the mean while, I already implemented a timeout.
 Have a nice day
