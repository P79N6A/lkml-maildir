Coincidence I'm full of, and (bad) luck this week as well it seems.  I want 
to know who's black cat has been crossing my path.  This gives me a better 
direction to test it in.  The machines I have the problem with are all 
running SMP preemptible 2.6.8 on an HT machine with a single physical core, 
I'll try putting or booting them into a non-SMP kernel...if it's suddenly 
good, well....we found our rat.  That would though explain it pretty well 
since thinking about it, it doesn't happen in the debian installer nor... i 
think it's one of the gentoo installers or something...and those are 386 
non-SMP kernels.
Might've found some sort of wacky edge-case that can reproduce that bug 
reliably.  I'd be much appreciative if you pass a link or the diff itself 
along to me (or a specific bit to look for in archives/etc).  It might, or 
might not, be my little gremlin.  In the meantime I just leave off 
console=ttyS1,38400 and hold my breath while they boot.

No...telnet...though...I just realised I haven't verified that on anything 
but the BSD based telnet program on Mac OS X, and FreeBSD 4.11(ish), so 
really, it might be something there too, but again, 2.4 never sees these 
issues, and I'm really not sure what's getting into the stream, I think nul 
because I get a '^@' translated back at me, which IIRC is the 
representation for nul but lord knows if that's from the telnet client 
after it echos or what, I haven't done a packet dump of this gremlin, yet.

OK atleast I'm not total net.kook here.

Yeah, embedded certainly is its own special little corner of heaven or hell 
depending on your view, or whims.
