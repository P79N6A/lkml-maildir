Actually, I lied a little bit - it was 2.6.22 with clock=tsc (which
 warns on boot about clock= being deprecated in favor of
 clocksource= ). I assume behavior is identical for now.
Please find attached the dmesg ring (incomplete, as the
 kernel ring size I have seems too small to hold the full
 buffer, but it seems to have all the interesting stuff) of
 2.6.20, 2.6.22, 2.6.22 with clock=tsc.
If you need more info, just ask. I'll be out of the country
 from July 12 to the morning of July 16, and again from
 July 17 to July 20, so if you'd rather get at this later on,
 it's okay for me ;)
thanks, ciao,
