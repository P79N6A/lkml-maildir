We had a bitmask, which Linus said to replace with a string.  We have
21 architectures, and a string works well in practice.  We could have
a bitmask *and* a string, but why the complexity?

All modprobe -f knows is that it should remove/rename various sections
from the elf object before handing it to the kernel.  The checking is
done in the kernel, as it should be (so we could change this whenever
we want, for example).
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
