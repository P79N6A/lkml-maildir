yes, actually this and init itself (which uses the 
pid to switch between init and telinit behaviour)
are the only two applications we found so far ...
and as far as I know, those work with non pid=1
values on other operating systems (inside containers)
a fix there would definitely be appreciated and 
I think it would not hurt normal behaviour ...

for the pid space, I'm not really sure if isolation
is really cheaper than virtualization, but for the
network space for example, a virtualization solution
which is as lightweigth as the isolation is probably
more challenging, although not impossible ...

again, for the pid space, maintenance is quite low ..
