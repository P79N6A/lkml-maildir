Or go the beancounter route: process 1 asks "can I pin 20 pages", gets
told "yes", and goes allocating them, blocking as necessary until it
gets them.  Process 2 asks "can *I* pin 20 pages" and the answer is
either "not right now", in which case it waits for process 1 to
release its reservation, or "no, you've exceeded your user quota" in
which case it fails with ENOMEM.  (That latter case can protect us
against a lot of DoS attacks from local users.)
The same accounting really needs to be done for page tables, as that
represents one of the biggest sources of unaccounted, unswappable
pages which user processes can cause to be created right now.
