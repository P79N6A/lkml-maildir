Sorry, my botched phrasing was intended to read more like "if this would 
be viewed as a good thing".  Since pm_suspend is the "externally visible 
function for suspending system" it seems it might be proper to export it 
for module use as well, much like various APM and software suspend 
functions in the same directory.  We only have test code that uses this, 
so no big deal on our part; I'll send out a call to some designers who 
are building embedded gadgets using pm_suspend() to see if anybody has 
interest in this and code to go along with it.  Thanks -- Todd
