By the way shouldn't a munmap call really free the memory. I have an strace
showing that the process calls munmap a lot but I do not seeany gaps in the
map file

Yes, your assumtion about the 1GB is correct.

The deleted marks in question mean that the file in question has been 
unlinked (rm'ed), however it is still being used and the inode in question 
still exists.  This memory is in use and thus validly takes up mapping 
space.  You'd need to unmap inorder to free that memory.  Deleting a file 
does not delete that file until _all_ processes close and unmap any 
references to it.  What's more worrying is the large area of unmapped 
memory below 1GB (0x40000000), wonder why it doesn't get allocated?  But I 
think the answer is that the standard allocator only searches 1GB..3GB for 
free areas...
Cheers,
MaZe.
