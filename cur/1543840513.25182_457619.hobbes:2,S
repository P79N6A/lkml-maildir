I still think doing simple accounting per-page would be a better way to
go than trying to pin down all "user allocatable" kernel allocations.
And would require all of about 2 hooks in the page allocator. And would
track *actual* RAM allocated by that container.
Can we continue that discussion (ie. why it isn't good enough). Last I
was told it is not perfect and can be unfair... sounds like it fits the
semantics perfectly ;)
