Yes indeed. The only thing I've seen in the last two days was the
following on resume:
pci_express 0000:00:1c.2:pcie03: resuming
sr 0:0:0:0: resuming
sd 2:0:1:0: resuming
sd 2:0:1:0: [sda] Starting disk
ata1.00: configured for UDMA/33
ata3.01: revalidation failed (errno=-2)
ata3: failed to recover some devices, retrying in 5 secs
ata3.01: configured for UDMA/133
