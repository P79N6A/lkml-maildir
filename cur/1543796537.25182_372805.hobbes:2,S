I can't think of a single valid reason why a program would want
to know the MHz rating of a CPU. Given that it's a) approximate,
b) subject to change due to power management, c) completely nonsensical
across CPU vendors, and d) only one of many variables regarding CPU
performance, any program that bases any decision on the values found
by parsing that field of /proc/cpuinfo is utterly broken beyond belief.
Adding any other interface to obtain this value is equally as broken.
