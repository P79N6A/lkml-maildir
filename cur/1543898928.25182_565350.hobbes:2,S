Hi All,
Sometime back we started retrospection on LTP and the various ways to 
make it better. It resulted in critical evaluation of LTP within & 
outside LTP users community. It also reflected the various ways on 
making it more better and effective. Working in this direction, we have 
come up with a road map which we feel will be helpful to the community. 
The following wiki pages will throw some light on the same:

Your comments on the contents and the goals set will be highly 
appreciated. All comments will be published on the above wiki pages.
Regards & Thanks--
