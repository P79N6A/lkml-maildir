Subject: [RFC][PATCH 0/6] Integrity Service and SLIM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/14/162

This is an updated request for comments on a proposed integrity 
service framework and dummy provider, along with SLIM, a low 
water-mark mandatory access control LSM module which utilizes the 
integrity services as additional input to the access control decisions.
The latest fixes include:
	- SLIM: Locking overhaul
	- All: Update to 2.6.18-rc1 kernel
Later we will be submitting EVM as a specific integrity service
provider under this proposed framework. By separating the submissions,
we hope that the integrity framework and its relationship to SLIM
(and potentially to selinux) will be clearer and easier to review.
Since this integrity provider is a dummy, it has no requirements for
TPM hardware, or for LSM stacking, again making the review simpler.
A corresponding userspace utility package is available at
http://www.research.ibm.com/gsal/tcpa
Patch 1/6 is a tiny patch to make mprotect available for revocation
Patch 2/6 provides the integrity service API with dummy provider.
Patch 3-6 provide SLIM, and a more detailed description of
its changes, and points out its use of the integrity service.
These patches have no prerequisites for stacker or TPM related patches.
