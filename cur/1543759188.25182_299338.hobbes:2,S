before you do this, we have to make -rc's real rc's. Seriously how can
it be that there is a diff between the last rc and the "vanilla"
release. Thats a no-goer in my opinion. Even if it is small things,
there is a chance that it breaks. If there patches that have to be
applied, because they are bugfixes, then make another rc before going live.
And odd/even sub number won't help here anyway. People who get the
kernel won't know it, there will be confusion, etc.
I would stick with the current scheme, I see no big advantage in a
special odd/even numbering. If there is a bugfix release, call it
X.Y.Z.1 like for 2.6.8, rest of the bugfixing can be found in -ac/-as
patchsets anyway.
The time of using vanilla kernels is long over. Nowadays its more like,
something, where you wait that a vendor gives you a kernel, or else you
will shot your own foot off ...
