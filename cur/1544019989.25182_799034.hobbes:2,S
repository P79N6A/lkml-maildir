Gah, I edited that, and generated the patch using
# git diff --stat -p 4f4b6c1a94a8735bbdc030a2911cf395495645b6.. kernel/smp.c | xclip
on Ingo's tip/master. However it seems such a diff does not include
non-commited changes, even though a regular git diff does:
# git diff kernel/smp.c
diff --git a/kernel/smp.c b/kernel/smp.c
index 9eead6c..bbedbb7 100644

                        data = kmalloc(sizeof(*data), GFP_ATOMIC);
                        if (data)
What is the recommended way to do such a diff?
