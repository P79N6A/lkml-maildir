I agree. dev->parent now is only expected to be set in device_add(),
not in device_initialize(), so the sequence above is perfectly fine.
(Why should you need it, anyway? parent information becomes necessary
only when something is added to the tree.)

Yes. We shouldn't do that.

I'd expect most allocations to be done when probing, so this shouldn't
hurt much.

I'd trust the subsystems to know best whether something regarding NUMA
changed.
