tcp_sequence returns two flag bits instead of it's current binary
state.  One bit says "accept data", the other says "accept control
bits" (such as RST, ACK, etc.)
tcp_sequence also will truncate the data len of the SKB area if
necessary, BSD really puts total crap in the probe byte.
Callers of tcp_sequence check the return value bits accordingly.
This is all slow path code, so there are no performance issues.
