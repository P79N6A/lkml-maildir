I've seen the input overrun message also (with the vanilla driver, not
patched). It's effect is that the first bytes (maybe up to 100..300
bytes) are scrambled. It's like accessing a serial link with a horribly
wrong baud rate.
After a split-second, however, everything is okay and I start receiving
valid NMEA data from my GPS receiver. For me, that's not much of a
problem because nmea is checksum'ed and the bad bytes are ignored...
