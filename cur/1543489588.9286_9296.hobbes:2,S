Subject: [Why?] 2.2.3 still broken on PPC

When 2.2.2 came out, it was broken for most non-Intel architectures. I
understood this was a kind of cruel joke by Linus with an educational
purpose: He wanted that the semaphore things should be patched as fast
as possible.
Now this has been done for PPC a long time ago, before even 2.2.3-pre1
came out. Version 2.2.3 has appeared, and it is still broken on PPC; the
semaphore.h and semaphore-helper.h patches have not been included. There
has been some guessing being going on on linuxppc-dev about the reasons.
My question is: Is there some deeper reason for this or is it just an
oversight? The LinuxPPC users would like to be able to swim with the
mainstream as it was possible until 2.2.1.
