Subject: [PATCH] [0/50] x86 2.6.24 patches review II
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/21/445

- More cleanups and bug fixes
- Use CLFLUSH in c_p_a(). This were the patches that caused some trouble
in -mm with X11, but it should be hopefully fixed now (we'll see)
- Report all IPIs in /proc/interrupts (useful e.g. to find out why
CPU isolation fails) 
- Experimental patch to disable SVM for the clinical paranoid
- Dump the LER registers on Oopses by default (note that this is not 100%
reliable -- we know how to make it reliable, but that's not implemented yet)
Please review.
-Andi
