As previously posted and noted in Documentation/Changes:
   To use System V shared memory, you have to mount the shm filesystem
somewhere and put the mountpoint into /proc/sys/kernel/shmpath.
Default is /var/shm.
So add a line like the following to /etc/fstab:
none            /var/shm shm            defaults                0   0
And that should do the trick.
