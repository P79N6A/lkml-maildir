Speaking specifically to adding 'EXPERIMENTAL', I distinctly remember at 
some point in the past the config system was smart enough to print " 
(EXPERIMENTAL)" if that entry depended on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.
We should head in that direction.
I strongly NAK the original patch from Gabriel C in this thread -- it 
just adds too much redundant info.  Better to add it -once-, somewhere 
inside Kconfig system.
