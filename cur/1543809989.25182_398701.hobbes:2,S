This patch already exists, see:

It's a proof of concept and needs to be polished (I'll look into that
again in March).
Only it still probes all /dev/hd and /dev/sg and /dev/pg in a dumb way,
rather than looking at sysfs or reading through /dev/.

That's probably not it, since there's a separate DVD-RAM line here:

hdd = Plextor PX-W4824TA
hdc = NEC ND-4550A
sr0 = Plextor PX-32TS
(Now NEC only needs to teach their drives to be more error tolerant when
reading and adjust their read speed to the actual sustained transfer
rate as Toshiba drives have been doing for ages...)
