I assumed that email I received from Warren Togami was official notice that
RHEL4 is going to be udev based and that as vmnet does not currently create
its device nodes in /dev, something should be done about it.
As this request was quite popular, and doing it properly through sysfs 
instead of doing several mknods when initscripts run, I filled internal
bug report that RHEL4 will use udev and vmnet should be compatible with
it.  And then I implemented some minimal sysfs support.
Week after that I saw first email from Greg changing sysfs_driver_* & co.
to GPL only.  I did not worry as this set did not comtain class_simple,
and so I assumed that I'm doing nothing wrong.  But today I noticed
that even class_simple is GPL only in -mm.
It was not lot of work, I'd say under 1 hour, but it just does not seem
correct to me, changing symbols visibility after people start using them.
OK, next beta will do several mknods in /etc/init.d/vmware script.
Not technically nice, but working.
