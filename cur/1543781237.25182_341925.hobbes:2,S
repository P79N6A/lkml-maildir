Hi all,
Maybe teaching you all to suck eggs here, but I used to get this a lot on my 
CD's - KDE ran some probe and as the CD[s] where empty logs filled up rapidly 
with that error.  I thought the[a] drive was duff, so bought a new CD-RW.
Made no difference :-/  I then investigated further, and read that instead of 
the SCSI emulation, it was superceded by IDE-CD.
kernel 2.6.12.3
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=Nicks ro root=303 hdc=ide-cd hdd=ide-cd
Fixed the issue for me.  But as I say, teaching to suck eggs, but I thought I 
would mention it.
Nick
