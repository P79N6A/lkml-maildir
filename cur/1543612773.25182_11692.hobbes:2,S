Right but instead of saying "it doesnt work" it might be worth saying "it
doesnt work for me on ppc64". The latter I can well believe

It's trying to ensure we make use of idle cpu units. Right now it doesn't
also consider the matching mm check to be per chip not per scheduling unit.
I've suggested that to Intel but not yet had any definitive answer stating
that it is an improvement.
[Actually it isnt always preferable there is a reverse argument in two
 cases
	1.	Where both threads share the same mm
	2.	When you are trying to save power over performance
]

Its based on real world runs with things like Oracle with a constraint that
the change must be clear and provably correct to get into a stable kernel
tree. For 2.5 we know the scheduler has to be rewritten somewhat and getting
it generically right is very important.
