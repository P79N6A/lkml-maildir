But it must be SOMETHING, right?
Kernel compile is too broad. Can you try to narrow it down?
Does burnCPU trigger it? Several burnCPUs?
dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null?
dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1M count=128?
network flood? (/me uses netcat and UDP)
Combination of above?
Then, you will be able to call for testing.
You can post your kernel version and .config
and ask folks who has identical hardware to try
to duplicate.
