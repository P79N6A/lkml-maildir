Very cool! I had actually been working on a version of the same thing
bug got stalled on the duplicated ACPI parsing. I like your trick of
having it as a module to avoid the ACPI early boot parsing, but it could
cause problems with alternate time sources. Maybe later in the 2.6/2.7
time frame we can do some sort of delayed registering and time
selection. 
I'll play around with it and let you know if I have any other feedback.
Very nice work!
