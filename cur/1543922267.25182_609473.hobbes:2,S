Subject: handling watchdog in SMP

I was hoping to get some ideas on how to handle the watchdog timers  
we have on some embedded PPC (booke_wdt.c) cores when we are in a SMP  
system.
The problem is since the watchdog is part of the processor core  
depending on which processor a given system call is executed at we  
might get different behavior.  It seems like we would want to mirror  
the actions to both cores (via smp_call_function).
Looking at the file ops we currently support in booke_wdt.c it seems  
like we could mirror the actions for booke_wdt_write()/booke_wdt_ping 
() to both cores and ensure when we set something like  
WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT we set the registers in both processors.
I was wondering if anyone had any other ideas or if this model seems  
to work.
