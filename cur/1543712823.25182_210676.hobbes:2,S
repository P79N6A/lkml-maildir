Well the good news is that my test box now oopses on about 2-out-of-3 boot
attempts.  But that gets tiresome.

Optimistic, too.
I'm thinking that this can be fixed from the other direction: just before
release_dev() calls close (dropping BKL), if tty->count==1, make the
going-away tty ineligible for concurrent lookups.  Do that by setting
tty->driver->ttys[idx] to NULL.  Maybe.
