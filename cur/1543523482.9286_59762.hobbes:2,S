For a limited subset it probably can. Except that the vesa acceleration I've
seen is pretty piss poor.
For consoles Vesa 1.2 is also a problem due to the banking and the fact we
may want to change bank during an IRQ. A vesa 1.2 bios X server would be a
great hack, but probably not terribly productive.

Im under the impression Egbert Eich is doing exactly this for XFree 4.0 to
bios initialise some cards.
