(FYI)
Hi,
I realized that the following objects are rebuilt, even if none of 
them has changed (and no include file neither):
drivers/char/{pty,misc,console,selection,keyboard,sysrq}.o
I saw It when I only had changed /drivers/char/serial.o, once when I 
had changed kernel/time.c, and recently after having changed 
arch/i386/kernel/time.c.
I'm using the serial driver as a module, and my symbols have version 
information, but I did not change any prototypes or data definitions 
when it happened.
Regards,
Ulrich
