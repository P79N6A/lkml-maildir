Hi, I'm the other admin of this machine...
Alan, you're right, there are a lot of eggdrops on the machine. It's
primarily used for bots, bouncers, and irc clients. It also is a secondary
nameserver, web server, and mail exchanger. We really are looking forward
to getting this resolved ASAP. Please let us know what we can do to fix
this, or help fix it.
Thanks.
