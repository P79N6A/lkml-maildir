To be honest from my understanding of SELinux there is no need at all  
to use FS caps on an SELinux system.  Anything that could be done  
with FS caps would be done in a much more fine-grained method with  
SELinux, and the inheritance of filesystem-based capabilities should  
be masked by SELinux-allowed capabilities anyways.  I guess it _can_  
be done, but why?  It's possible to set up an SELinux system so that  
there aren't even any SUID binaries, right?  /etc/passwd can run as  
whatever random user and it will automatically transition to the  
appropriate domain such that it can read and modify /etc/shadow.
