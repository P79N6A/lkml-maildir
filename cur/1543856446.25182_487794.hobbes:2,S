It means that if there's no pipe() call, everything is fine.
That is, for a shell script it's just more likely to contain
some pipelines.

So can this be fixed, too? ;)

Yes I did.  For an rpm- or deb-based kernel, the "build number" is irrelevant
(it's always 1, since both rpm and deb rebuilds everything from scratch).
This #2.6.19.0 comes from the package revision number - I just do
  echo $revision > .version
and remove the part from Makefile which updates the file on every (re)build.
But this isn't relevant for the discussion.

Yup.  Oh those foreign languages... :)

Another funny revision number? ;)

Well, that fixes the OOPs, but I'd do it a in bit more readable way,
and eliminating the gotos too (this is a stylistic change - I see alot
of gotos in kernel for error returns, but here, in such a small function,
gotos looks somewhat funny, esp. when the only statement after the label
is 'return NULL'):

In either case, this change not fixes the problem.  As I said, the OOPs is
harmless (yes, not harmful :), so the end effect is the same, just instead
of the OOPs, now the bad stuff is coming from shell complaining about failing
to create pipe.
