"console=" takes driver-supplied names which usually happen to match 
/dev node names. For example, drivers/serial/8250.c names itself 
"ttyS", so "console=ttyS0" will end up going to that driver, regardless 
of the state of /dev.
I'm not saying that's good or bad, but what's the alternative? 
"console=class/tty/ttyS0"?
