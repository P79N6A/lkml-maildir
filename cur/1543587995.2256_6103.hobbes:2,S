Have you had any feedback about this patch?  I applied it last night to
2.4.3.  It seemed to work.  When I booted my computer this morning fsck
complained about problems with the directory on one of my ext2 file systems.
Since fsck does not run on every boot I dont really have a way of knowing if
this has anything to do with your patch or not.  I'm running the patched
kernel again right now.  Ill shutdown and force an fsck later today to see
if anything shows up.
Thanks,
Jim
