Wouldn't this be sensible to integrate into CFS _regardless_ of anything 
else?
Especially with the alleged "pluggable" scheduler model, one of the things 
lacking in any pluggability is the fact that the core thread data 
structures are anythign but pluggable. This patch makes it no more so, but 
at least it abstracts out the fields that are used by the scheduler, and 
would seem to be a nice cleanup. No?
