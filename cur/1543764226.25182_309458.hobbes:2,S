Interesting.  Looks like pci_enable_wake(dev, state, 0) isn't actually
disabling wakeup on your hardware.  (Assuming CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND=n; if
not, then it's odd that the system went back to sleep!)  Do you think
that might be related to those calls manipulating the Apple ASICs being
in the OHCI layer rather than up nearer the generic PCI glue?  (I still
think they don't belong in USB code -- ohci or usbcore -- at all.  If
the platform-specific PCI hooks don't suffice, they need fixing.)
Thanks for the testing update.  I'm glad to know that there seems to
be only one (minor) glitch that's PPC-specific!

OK, I just posted the patch cleaning up EHCI port power switching;
that should remove the need for that separate patch.  (As well as
fixing some minor annoyances.)
