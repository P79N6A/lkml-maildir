folx,
sorry for the late reply.  catching up on kernel mail.
so all this TSO stuff looks v. v. similar to the IP-only fragmentation 
that patricia gilfeather and i implemented on alteon acenics a couple of 
years ago (see 
http://www.cs.unm.edu/~maccabe/SSL/frag/FragPaper1/
 for a 
general overview).  it's exciting to see someone else take a stab on 
different hardware and approaching some of the tcp-specific issues.
the main different, though, is that general purpose kernel development 
still focussed on the improvements in *sending* speed.  for real high 
performance networking, the improvements are necessary in *receiving* cpu 
utilization, in our estimation. (see our analysis of interrupt overhead 
and the effect on receivers at gigabit speeds--i hope that this has become 
common understanding by now)
i guess i can't disagree with david miller that the improvments in TSO are 
due entirely to header retransmission for sending, but that's only because 
sending wasn't CPU-intensive in the first place.  we were able to get a 
significant reduction in receiver cpu-utilization by reassembling IP 
fragments on the receiver side (sort of a standards-based interrupt 
mitigation strategy that has the benefit of not increasing latency the way 
interrupt coalescing does).
anyway, nice work, 
t.
