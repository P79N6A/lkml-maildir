I don't know if there's some knob for that.  What I'm always doing:
tcpdump on one interface and then a broadcast ping on the other one.
If you want to write a hardware test program maybe using raw ethernet
packets is the way to go.  These can be send directly to a specific
interface and don't require it to be IP-configured.  man 7 packet
