I'm assuming you are trying to insert the new module in your old kernel?
This is one of the unfortunate but hardly avoidable cases where adding a 
module requires installing a new kernel.
But there's a change in 2.6.15-rc1 that makes this issue much worse:
It is no longer user-visible.
tristate's select'ing bool's that do not change parts of the (modular) 
driver but compile additional code into the kernel are simply wrong.
