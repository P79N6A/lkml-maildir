I really hate to disagree with the chief penguin here, but
it's extremely dumb to return errors from close(). The last
time we trashed this issue on this list was when a newbie used
an error return from release() to communicate with his driver.
The problem with errors from close() is that NOTHING SMART can be
done by the application when it receives it. And application can:
 a) print a message "Your data are lost, have a nice day\n".
 b) loop retrying close() until it works.
 c) do (a) then (b).
The thing about (b) is that the kernel can do it much better.
Another thing proponents of errors from close() better ask themselves
is if the file descriptor stays open or closed if close() abends.
If it remains open, your exit() is bust. If it closes, you
cannot retry the error (b).
