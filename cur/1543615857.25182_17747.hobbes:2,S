<<?  Do you have an example where this fails?  Do you not consider it a
bug?  Now, I would place a fair amount of buren on the compiler to get
it right, though, this isn't absolute.  For example, eieieio or

I don't see the obligation on the compiler here. For instance spupose
you are on an architecture where a word read is faster than a byte read.
Let's make it specific, suppose you are on a 386 and the item is 16-bits.
Now it is quicker to read 32-bits, because no prefix is required. Do you
see anything in the C standard (or the Ada standard :-) which requires a
16-bit read here? I don't, but perhaps I am missing something.
Now if you are saying that this is a reasonable expectation, nothing to do
with the standard, then that's another matter, but my example of a tradeoff
with efficiency is an interesting one.
