offer, there was a foreigner who lived here in Cotonou-Benin some time ago called Arthur Billings by name,and it happened that 
the man registered with me as his personal attorney,unfortunately the man died with his wife and their two kids in a plane crash 
which happened on 30th October, 1999. Owing to the death of this man called Arthur Billings by name,his bank called on me for 
his fund with the bank as his attorney since January 2000,to invite his relatives 
to come and claim the money,i tried all i could to trace his family,but all my efforts proved arbortive,then from January this year 
2003,till now,the bank has been presurising me to look for his family because there is lot of swindlers have been forwarding 
application to claim the money as his next of kin,but it happened that after much verification,they will find out that those people 
were crooks,because they cannot provide a legal evidence to prove that they were his relative.
Moreover,i have decided to use you as his next of kin to claim this fund as it stands since his relatives were not available up till 
now, i have all the important document's in my file which i will back you up before the bank as his next of kin,i will still obtain a 
genuine legal evidence which i will make out in your name to satisfy that you are the rightful next of kin to the deceased.
Furthermore,the amount involved is ($12.750,000.00)Twelve Million,Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States 
Dollars,therefore i will like you to furnish me with your full name and address,fax/phone which i will use to secure the legal 
documents,as soon as i receive these information,i will forward a text of application to you which you will submit to the paying 
department bank as his next of kin.i will assured you that this is 100% free risk involved as i have perfected and made the 
neccessary arrangements to back you up in claiming this fund.
Finally,you have to maintain the high secret of this deal demands as the bank does not know that i am using you to claim the 
money on my own,besides,i agree to give you 30% of the total money for your help ,and i will like to invest my own part of the 
money in your country based on your assistant and your advice.Therefore ,i am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as 
posible .
