Roman, you can have any of your data that you want, including the metadata
such as dates, times, user names, etc.  Nobody is hiding that from you,
it's all there, you don't need a license to get it, go to bkbits.net and
get it.  If someone has a tree that you want to get it from you can ask
them to put a copy on bkbits and away you go.

That's not a network protocol, just change the bloody commit trigger.
I don't care if you get that information, if you want it, have at it.
