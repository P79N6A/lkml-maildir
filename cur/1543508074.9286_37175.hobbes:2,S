Ahh, now I understand why these patches haven't gone into the kernel: you're
concerned about the compatibility with existing linux 2.2.x distributions and
installations. I've always thought the patches weren't stable enough yet.
IMO someone who upgrades the kernel should also be able to read the
Changes file. I don't think this is a problem for distributors.
