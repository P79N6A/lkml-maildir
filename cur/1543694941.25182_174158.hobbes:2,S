Clearly that's true inside the kernel. Although the speed will be
somewhat less because you may not always need four bytes, no?
The benefit of a random number source user programs can use, which is
going to avoid giving the same number to multiple processes or threads
is significant for simulations and sampling. It doesn't matter if this
is done with frandom or speeding urandom to similar speed, other than
that some people will protest a change in urandom, even a change for the
better.
