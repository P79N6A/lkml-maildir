Yes, of course, but the majority of desktop, workstations and server
machines run whatever kernel their distribution supplies.
Within a year, a lot of distributions will start offering both 2.4 and
2.6.  The only reason to run the distribution's 2.4 kernel will be if
the 2.6 one doesn't work on the user's hardware.  In that case, we
will want to add support to/fix 2.6 as a priority, rather than adding
support to 2.4.
Only users with specific requirements will replace a distribution's
2.6 kernel with their own compiled 2.4 kernel, and those users will
typically be knowledgeable enough to use different trees, pre-patches,
out of tree drivers, or whatever is necessary to add the features,
(such as ALSA), to 2.4.

Maybe longer than the 2.4.22 development cycle, but I think almost
everybody agrees that too much was done between 2.4.20 and 2.4.21.

I think new development should concentrate on 2.6, otherwise it's just
going to be delayed longer than necessary.
