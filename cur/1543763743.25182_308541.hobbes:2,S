Not that I really know what I'm talking about here, but this sounds 
highly parallelizable.  It seems like you could do N/2 measurements at a 
time, so this should be O(N) to compute the matrix (ignoring issues of 
how long it takes to write the data to memory, but that should be 
insignificant).
Even if you can't parallelize it all the way, it ought to at least help.
