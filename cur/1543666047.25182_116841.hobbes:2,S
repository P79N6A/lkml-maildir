The situation is different between 2.4 and 2.5 ...
In 2.4 the per device queue_depth is an unsigned char
and that number of scsi_cmnd instances are pre-allocated
in the scsi_build_commandblocks() function. So the worst
case number of scsi_cmnd instances for all scsi devices
is always available (at the expense of [wasted] ram).
In 2.5 queue_depth is an unsigned short and a slab
allocator called "scsi_cmd_cache" is used as required.
There is some throttle logic (or at least it has been
talked about) to make sure one scsi_cmnd instance per
scsi device will always be available.
I think that comment (probably by Doug Ledford) refers
to the 2.5 series before the slab allocator was
introduced.
