yes, I know. If the patch won't show up soon I _will_ send it to Linus.
But it's usually easier to get it in when some Maintainer sticks an OK-label
on it :-)

Well, I thought that box was already retired, but I may be wrong.

Thanks! Hopefully it won't take long to find it's way into mainline (hint hint...)

I'd prefer if development is tightly coupled to mainline so that the version
skew is minimized. Yes, here will be kernels that won't work for various 
reasons but that's why it's called development kernel :)
I strongly feel that _now_ is the time to sync up so we can start with a more
or less working 2.6.0 and don't have to wait until 2.6.2x ...
