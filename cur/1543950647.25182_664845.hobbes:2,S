I found priority of some processes is always 0 but they are highly
related to this kind of deadlock.
What does Priority 0 mean? When and in which case is it's priority
changed to 0? When can it's priority be restored to one higher value.
A simple script to get priority 0:
===================================================================
#!/bin/sh
for file in `ls /proc/*/sched`
do
        prio=`grep prio $file | awk '{print $3;}'`
        if [ "X$prio" == "X0" ] ; then
                echo "`head -n 1 $file | awk '{print $1}'`: $prio"
        fi
done
==================================================================
