Alan,
This does not seem to fix the problem with "clock timer", which
repeatedly prints the following message:
probable hardware bug: clock timer configuration lost - probably a VIA686a motherboard.
probable hardware bug: restoring chip configuration.
The machine does not get any further than printing the above message.
This message only appears with an SMP kernel, there are no ide devices
in the machine.
a generic 2.4.3 kernel works on the machine.
Thanks.
