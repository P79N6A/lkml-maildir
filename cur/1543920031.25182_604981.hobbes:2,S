Thanks for the suggestions.
The -I command prints out a bunch of stuff including:
Standby timer values: spec'd by Standard, with device specific minimum
I tried setting -B to 1 and and then set -S to 5 minutes.
Also, -B 255 and then set -S to 5 minutes.
No luck with either. These drives want to keep running.
One thing of possible interest: The -B command printed
the following message:
/dev/sda:
 setting Advanced Power Management level to 0x01 (1)
 HDIO_DRIVE_CMD failed: Input/output error
I would guess that the first line came out just before
hdparm tried to do the set, and the second line indicates
that the set failed.
Perhaps -S is failing too, just without the diagnostic?
All of the above using 2.6.22-gentoo-r5
I have not yet tried 2.6.23 as suggested by Mark Lord.
