which program are you using ?
I don't see any such problems in 2.2.x (now 2.2.10) with same 
configuration using xntpd (xntpd 3-5.93a) and my own small dcf programm. and it's even 
a UART with FIFO:
	# setserial -bg /dev/refclock-0 
	/dev/refclock-0 at 0x01a8 (irq = 5) is a 16550A (Fourport)
	# stty  < /dev/refclock-0
	speed 50 baud; line = 0;
