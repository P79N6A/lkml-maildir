Well, this is VERY offtopic, but i wonder:
Is Linux a real-time os just like Qnx?
I have read it somewere, but i cant remember were, and now me and my
friends talked about it, but we found no answer.
And, if linux now is a realtime-os, how can you see that if you compare to
other os that not is realtime.
Hope somebody will answer my stupid question... =)
