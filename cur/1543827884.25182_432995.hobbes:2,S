The broadcasts don't have to leave my PC so I
shouldn't need a multicast router, do I?  The client
is running in one terminal window and the server in a
second terminal window.
I checked the router man page and found the following:
route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0
This is an obscure one documented so people know how
to do it. This sets all of the class D (multicast) IP
routes to go via "eth0".  This is the correct normal
configuration line with a multicasting kernel.
If there is another command, will you please tell me
what it is?
Thanks,
