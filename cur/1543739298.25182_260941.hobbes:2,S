I'd disagree.  Do you consider SELinux to be policy as well just because
it's in the kernel?
As David said in his response, it's a mechanism.  Whether _you_ choose
to use it or not decides the "policy".  That's why I said put a config
option around it.  You would still have _choice_.

Absolutely.  So why are you trying to prevent people that want to use
module signing from doing so?
