I'm suggesting
    check irqcount
    if (wasnt_in_irq)
        rsp = irqstack
    ++irqcount
If the NMI happens before the increment, we'll switch the stack 
unconditionally, and if the NMI happens after the increment, then we 
won't switch the stack, but we're guaranteed to be on the irqstack 
anyway.  The window size is negative :)
Similarly, the exit path should be
    oldstack_reg = oldstack;
    --irqcount;
    rsp = oldstack_register;
To guarantee that by the time we decrement irqcount, we don't need the 
stack anymore.

I have a truly marvellous patch that fixes the bug which this
signature is too narrow to contain.
