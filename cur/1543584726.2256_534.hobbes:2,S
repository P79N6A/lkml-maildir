Subject: [PATCH] remove second identical Configure.help entry for six CONFIGs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/3/10/35

As of 2.4.2-ac17, there are 8 CONFIG parameters which have two entries
in Configure.help.  Of these eight,  six have identical Configure.help text.
The following patch removes the second identical instance of those six.
If this patch is accepted, a patch to remove the obsolete version of the
other two (namely CONFIG_DEBUG_IOVIRT and  CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_TCPMSS)
will be posted here.
Here is the patch, against 2.4.2-ac17.
