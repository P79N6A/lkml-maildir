That is uglee. 
We really have this already, and it's called "current->preempt". It 
handles any lock at all, and doesn't add yet another special case to all 
the architectures.
Just do
	repeat:
		down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
		get_futex_key(...) etc.
		queue_me(...) etc.
		inc_preempt_count();
		ret = get_user(...);
		dec_preempt_count();
		if (unlikely(ret)) {
			up_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
			/* Re-do the access outside the lock */
			ret = get_user(...);
			if (!ret)
				goto repeat;
			return ret;
		}
		...
and you should be ok.
No new special cases, no new abstractions. At most, we should probably 
create a "get_user_inatomic()", to 
 - make it damn obvious what we're doing, and match the explicit
   "inatomic" in the other place where we depend on this (fs/filemap.c)
 - allow the regular "get_user()" to continue to do the normal
   "might_sleep()" checks.
That's assuming we can't just make rwsem's nest nicely.
