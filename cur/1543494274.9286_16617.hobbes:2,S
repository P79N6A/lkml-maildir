I have not been  following the `ac' releases, so I cann't tell you
exactly what patches Alan has applied.
From the quick look I took a week ago I would say that nfsd-2.2.2-1.patch
patch is in it.  The lockd patch is cosmetic and is not needed.
I hope to find the time to update the nfsd-2.2.2-1 patch soon.
