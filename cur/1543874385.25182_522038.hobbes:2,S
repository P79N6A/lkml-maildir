Are you talking about the current state of play?  If so, not precisely.  In
the current scheme of things, *all* VMAs are kept in a global tree and are
globally available; it's just that any VMA that's not shareable will not be
shared, and so, in effect, is per-process.
In my suggested revamp, VMAs revert to being per-process objects only, and
sharing is effected by indirection.

Currently, no - not unless the driver does something clever as ramfs does.
Sharing through the page cache is a nice idea, but it has some limitations,
mainly that non-sharing then operates differently.

I'm sure it will be, but at the cost of consuming extra memory.  I'm not sure
that the amount of extra memory is, however, all that significant.  Now that I
think about it, I don't imagine that a lot of processes are going to be
running at once on a NOMMU system, and so the scope for sharing isn't all that
wide.

There is no fork.
No, the problem is that sys_shmat() relies on do_mmap_pgoff() to call the VMA
open() method.  However, this assumes that a new VMA will be made per process.
