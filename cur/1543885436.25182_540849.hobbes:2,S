IMVHO the only sane thing is ALWAYS avoid "holes" (some old data, then
the "hole" of lost data, then some new data) after a flush().
HW buffers (and buffers on the remote end) are not an issue: they
contain fresher data (usually in "sliding window" mode) than buffered.
Thinking with a 300bps modem (anybody else remembers such an ancient
thing?):
- Sender have to transmit the alphabet;
- On the sender's modem there's a 4 char buffer
- On the receiver's modem there's another 4 char buffer
- The receiver's driver have another 4 char buffer
If the receiver issues a flush() after reading 'C', then the next read()
should return FGHIJKL...Z (or anything IN SEQUENCE), but *NEVER* DEFGKLM
(skipped H,I and J).
BYtE,
 Diego.
