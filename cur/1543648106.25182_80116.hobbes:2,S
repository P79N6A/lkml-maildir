Hi Ben,
I didn't address async poll's scalability  vs. /dev/epoll because 
/dev/epoll isn't in the kernel either. I wasn't sure whether you had a 
better async poll
in the making.
Either solution (/dev/epoll or async poll) would be a considerable 
improvement over what we have today.
So I guess the question would now be: whats keeping /dev/epoll from 
being included in the kernel given the time left before the feature freeze ?
