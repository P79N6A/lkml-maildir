If we're going to have specific slabs for each specific filesystem's inode
and superblock structures, why shouldn't we do the same with the struct
file and struct dentry? Right now, if a filesystem needs to stick some
information in there, it has to allocate and then dereference
file->private_data and dentry->d_fsdata, and I thought this cleanup was
trying to avoid that, right?
Something like this, added to the end of the filesystem declaration:
+       dentry_size:    sizeof(struct ext2_dentry_info),
+       file_size:      sizeof(struct ext2_file_info)
Obviously the above is only an example, since ext2 doesn't have those 
structures -- so it would simply use 0 instead.
>From the filesystems in the tree, only intermezzo actually allocates

(ab)use the private pointer to store an integer value, without actually 
allocating a private structure.
Stackable filesystems, on the other hand, make extensive use of all these 
private data pointers to store the links to the stacking level immediately 
underneath. Alas, they're not in the tree... :-)

Well... I said "minor point" and it degenerated into a full-fledged 
thread, while nobody actually cared much about the real code... :-)
I know the issue has been hashed to death already, but basically the 
common practice I was referring to is to *have* a space after a C keyword 
(for, while, return), but *not* after a function name.
Thanks,
