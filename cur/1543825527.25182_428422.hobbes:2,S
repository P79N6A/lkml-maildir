Not at all. The ACPI v3.0 specs mentions that:
"ACPI NVS Memory. This range of addresses is in use or reserve by
the system and must not be used by the operating system. This
range is required to be saved and restored across an NVS sleep."
In other words, it is similar to what Reserved is set to - except the
Non-Volatile Sleep area can be used when S4 save/restore occurs.

IMHO, based on the PCI 3.0 spec, the whole check should be removed - 
as the MCFG memory region does not have to be reserved in E820 table.
