Yes, but why do you start saying that?
Our topic is the statement that it is good to have device numbers
stable across a reboot. Not absolutely necessary, but good.
For example, given an NFS mount, if the server reboots and
suddenly the client sees different stat data, that would be
less than optimal. A low quality NFS implementation.
You write long stories - but it really is desirable to have
stable device numbers.

One of your side avenues is the matter of enumeration.
I don't see why that would be relevant. One identifies
things by their UUID. Order is never important.

A UUID usually takes 128 bits.
