There is a known <cough> problem in pine. See below:

pine crashes with "header size inconsistant" during saving mailbox if any
message contains X-Keywords line split in 2 or more lines...
Your post (maybe processed by MTA) contained 2-line X-Keywords so my
pine crashed... and I could find why. (and had finally motivation to
configure Mutt ;))
X-Keywords is processed in 2 functions:
mail_filter() (in imap/src/c-client/mail.c) filters out X-Keywords line
and seems to handle multi-line keywords correctly
unix_parse() (in imap/src/osdep/unix/unix.c) probably doesn't handle
multi-line keywords
Different results (different header sizes) causes pine crash.
The same may apply to X-UID, X-Status and Status header (I haven't test,
so I'm not sure).
imap uses the same c-client library, so the same condition may cause
imap crash.
