First thing would be to try 2.4.19-pre7.
But this does look like a VIA controller, and I think David just sent me
a patch to help fix some problems with this device, so you might be
better off trying this patch against 2.4.19-pre7:

If that patch doesn't help you out, please let me (and the
linux-usb-devel mailing list) know.
thanks,
