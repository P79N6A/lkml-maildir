Since you don't seem to be booting from the hard drive at all you could
just `make zdisk` (or bzdisk if needed) when building the kernel.  Just
have your destined boot disk in the drive and the new kernel will be dd'ed
right out to it.
On the other hand you could just manually dd the compressed kernel image
to the floppy with the same effect.
You can make a lilo boot disk, but that is a little more involved.  If
this is want you want (need) let me know and I'll go into it for you.
