Sorry for the slow reply. <insert-usual-excuses/>
Thanks though for picking this up and finding the time to have a nosey 
at it.

Agreed.

I thought long and hard about this when I initially put the code 
together, I thought that it could only go very large (when jiffies 
wraps) but never negative as I could not think of a case unless people 
had a source that provided new data at intervals of time where jiffies 
is larger than 2^32...hell you might as well not bother with that source 
:)
Of course I should handle the wrap case, which I have already done at 
least one (with an interval period of one second)...seemed to work fine.

Blind following of whats going on in linux/jiffies.h.  If they can be 
dropped then that's fine with me, I thought 'jiffies' was possibly 
64bit on a platform or two (sparc64 and alpha for example).

Will do, had no idea about that.

Again, I had no idea, I was reading a tutorial on timers[1] and it said 
init_timer().  "Just following orders capt'in".
I have removed the init_timer() and you are right, it is unneeded.

Cooks on my development ARM board with no problems, no idea if it works 
on x86 though :) As for not having the hardware present, it's a platform 
driver, surely it would be the fault of the crazed platform writer who 
would to do something like this?

Check.
Thanks again for having a look at my module.  All I need is some further 
feedback on the timer wrap bit (just ran it again now and it seems to 
work still as expected after five minutes) and then I will re-submit.
Cheers
