In my personal opinnion this whole unicode /gpm / blah / bloat stuff in
the current kernel is just plain... ehm. forgive me please: plain sick.
A VT100 console should do ASCII and maybe some additional frame
characters or
maybe even colors too. Point.
If You wont more, then go the following road:
1. Port xterm to use the framebuffer device and direct mouse handling.
   Yes it all can be done poperly in user space!
   (Another starting point could be the screen package too.)
2. Add wonderfull whatever translations / munglings drawings you like.
   You don't need to care about since, since this all happens in user
space
   anyway.
3. Go further and reimplement the support for multiple consoles this
way.
4. Remove all the fluffy rarely used stuff from the kernel. (gpm console
switch).
   You gotta have it now in user space.
5. Never look back ...
