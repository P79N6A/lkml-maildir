A couple of comments on this.
First, I've seen CDs in which the capacity reported by the CD is
actually slightly greater than the number of burned sectors.  In
that case, you'll get errors during the partition scanning.  You
can just ignore the errors, however, so it's no big deal.
Also, the default should probably be 16 partitions, since that
is what's supported on SGI CDs.  Most SGI CDs are in ISO format,
but Irix installation CDs do have an SGI partition table.
