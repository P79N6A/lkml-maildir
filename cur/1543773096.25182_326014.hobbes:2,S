If a disk is pulled or fails in such a way that the hotplug manager removes the corresponding /dev/xxx entry, I can not issue a mdadm --remove because the device doesn't exist.
I looked at the mdadm and md code and it looks like it relies on the device node existing.  I could make the appropriate code changes but wanted to see if there was another more standard way to deal with this.  I know I can create a node using mknod so I can issue the mdadm --remove and then delete the node but this really seems like a hack.
I did a bit of looking around and couldn't find an answer to this.  If this is not the right list for this question please point me to the correct place.
Thanks, -Matt-
