Yeah, I figured as much.  I started looking at some of the flash code
and did see busy waits, usually with timeouts, but that's still not
acceptable in RT.

I'll send a patch to Ingo to at least drop the real time priority of a
process dumping core. But then the next question is, what should the
core priority be? Meaning, what nice value?  Should this be a sysctl
value?  For now it should probably just drop to nice 0.

I totally agree.

If the core dump drops the task out of RT, then the user interface
should still be responding. Here the nice value may be a factor to, but
you shouldn't see 5 or 10 seconds waiting (unless you are running
Evolution, but then that's just normal! :-)

I'm not sure that this should be a kernel feature.  Maybe someday there
can be a notify event of when a process dumps core, but I suspect that
would be a low priority.  For now, since a core dump causes all tasks
sharing the memory to exit immediately, you may be able to figure out
how to monitor this externally. Or at least, check for activity of
something writing to core. 
Also, since a core dump is usually caused by a signal (is there any
other way?) you can have all the RT tasks catching these signals and try
to do something appropriately first.  But then again, a SIGSEGV is
usually something that makes the program unpredictable in continuing.
Just make sure your notifier doesn't do much (allocation or anything)
and is pretty bug free.

Capture the signal.

I'll work on lowering the priority.

Again, do this via the signal handler.
