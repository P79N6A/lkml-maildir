Machines are often bound on memory bus bandwidth, and smp will not
help you with memory bus bandwidth. Old pentium boards had shared
L2-cache, which was bad; P-II's have onchip L2 so I guess it is better
these days.
No, I do not have any backing numbers. I have blurred memory of people
being very happy when they got 30% or so increase... Sorry.
