Hi,
      I've run some tests with high system loads. I'm using
the command
       while true; do make clean; make MAKE='make -j10'; done
in two kernel trees at the same time to hold the system (PII, 400MHz,
128MB, 2x128MB swap UW-SCSI disk) at high load.
In comparison to 2.2.0 the 2.2.1 remains stable, no deadlock,
no oops, and no spontaneous reboot.
I've observed the load progress with xosview and xload.  The first remarkable
load peek was at 49, whereas the following load curve shows minima at appr. 10
and maxima at 33.  It looks like the systems needs time to get a well formed
cache, during this time the load curve will reach its highest point.
With this result in mind I've done a little patch to avoid this highest peak.
This patch seems to avoid the first mega peak and, as a side effect, the
long time average load seems to be higher together with a better interactive
response (mouse, ...) than without this little patch.
              Werner
