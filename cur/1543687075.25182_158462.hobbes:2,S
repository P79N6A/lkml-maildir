How spooky. now I got one too, (minus the noise).
Call Trace:
 [<c0120022>] __might_sleep+0x5b/0x5f
 [<c010cf8a>] save_v86_state+0x6a/0x1f3
 [<c010dad2>] handle_vm86_fault+0xa7/0x897
 [<c010b2ed>] do_general_protection+0x0/0x93
 [<c010a651>] error_code+0x2d/0x38
 [<c0109623>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
By the looks of the logs, it happened as I restarted X, as theres
a bunch of mtrr messages right after this..
