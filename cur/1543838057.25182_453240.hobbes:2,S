On the other hand, I think sched_setscheduler() does need tasklist_lock!
It is unsafe do dereference ->signal unless tasklist_lock or ->siglock
is held (or p == current). Yes, we pin the task structure, but this can't
prevent from release_task()->__exit_signal() which sets ->signal = NULL.
So, I think this patch
	[PATCH] Drop tasklist lock in do_sched_setscheduler
	commit e74c69f46d93d29eea0ad8647863d1c6488f0f55
is not correct.
Am I missed something?
Oleg.
