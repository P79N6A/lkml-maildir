Are there some documented guidelines on when to use BUG_ON? I see it 
used in other places in this way. My reasoning was that returning an 
error makes sense if external causes can result in an error, but this 
test is more the equivalent of an assert(), i.e. catching a programming 
bug early.

I was under the impression that the v4l core was all EXPORT_SYMBOL, but 
I took another look and a lot is now EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, so I guess I 
should use that as well.

They are small now, but they will become a lot larger in the future. 
There is a lot of common code in most if not all of the v4l drivers and 
my intention is to gradually expand the framework and move some of the 
common code into these headers/sources. This is just the start.
