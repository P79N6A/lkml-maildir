It's worse than just bonding related.  This also causes a reliable hard 
lockup with skge:
fresno:~# modprobe skge
fresno:~# ip li set eth2 up
fresno:~# ip li set eth2 down
fresno:~# ip li set eth3 up
The server locks up there.  Nothing is printed to console and it takes a 
power cycle to fix the problem.
eth2 and eth3 are both ports on an SK-9844 dual-port card.  The test above 
is with 2.6.22.  I've also had it fail with .21.*, .20.*, and several 
other kernels.
