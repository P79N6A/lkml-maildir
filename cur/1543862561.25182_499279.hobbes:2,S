It should be correct the way it is - that check is trying to prevent 
ATAPI commands from using DMA until the slave_config function has been 
called to set up the DMA parameters properly. When the 
NV_ADMA_ATAPI_SETUP_COMPLETE flag is not set, this returns 1 which 
disallows DMA transfers. Unless you were using an ATAPI (i.e. CD/DVD) 
device on the channel this wouldn't affect you anyway.
I'll try your stress test when I get a chance, but I doubt I'll run into 
the same problem and I haven't seen any similar reports. Perhaps it's 
some kind of wierd timing issue or incompatibility between the 
controller and that drive when running in ADMA mode? I seem to remember 
various reports of issues with certain Maxtor drives and some nForce 
SATA controllers under Windows at least..
