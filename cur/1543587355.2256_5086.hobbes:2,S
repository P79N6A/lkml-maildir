Hello!  In kernel 2.4.3, I think I found a minor error in the file:
	include/linux/ghash.h
On line 109, it says:
	int ix = hashfn(pos);\
and it should say:
	int ix = HASHFN(pos);\
Out of curiosity, is there a reason that this hash table doesn't seem to
be used anywhere in the kernel?  I stumbled across it while writing some
code for my OS class project and later realized that it isn't being used
anywhere.  Should I be avoiding this file for some reason?
