What would it take to have a pointer chain at a *well known* location or
similar magic so if a machine died, I'd be able to hook up a laptop with a
FireWire cable and do firescope magic to extract at least/just the dmesg buffer?  
(Yes, I know this requires a 1394 port and some previous cooperation and setup
on the part of the 1394 driver. Assume I can get away with saying "add this
to your kernel command line to make debugging easier for me" ;)
(And yes, 5 years ago I'd have been wanting a "dump dmesg to floppy" patch,
but times move one and 1394 is more likely than a floppy now...)
