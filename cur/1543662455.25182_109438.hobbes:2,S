It does not have necessarily to be just another ioctl/fcntl, it can be a
write. About security, chages might be allowed only to the task that
created the fd, if you're concerned. It's not that someone will starve
w/out such functionality though.

I was thinking more like :
int timerfd(int timeout, int oneshot);
that returns a pollable fd.
