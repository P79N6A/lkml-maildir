Running the test with /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory = 2, I get a similar 
result.  It still hangs after about 5.9GB, but it starts trying to write 
out the file sooner.
Here is the stack trace I have for the process (again, by hand, what didn't scroll by as nothing
makes it to logs...)
writetest:
  schedule_timeout
  io_schedule_timeout
  blk_congestion_wait
  throttle_vm_writeout
  shrink_zone
  shrink_caches
  try_to_free_pages
  __alloc_pages
    -> (up to here it matches the previous run's stack from rpciod/0)
  kmem_getpages
  cache_grow
  cache_alloc_refill
  kmem_cache_alloc
  mempool_alloc_slab
  mempool_alloc
  nfs_flush_one
  nfs_flush_list
  nfs_flush_inode
  nfs_write_pages
  do_writepages
  __filemap_fdatawrite_range
  filemap_fdatawrite
  filemap_write_and_wait
  nfs_revalidate_mapping
  nfs_file_write
  do_sync_write
  vfs_write
  sys_pwrite64
The memory dump showed there was memory still available, with no swap in use.
