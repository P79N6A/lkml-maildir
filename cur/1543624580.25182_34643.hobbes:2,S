	Maybe, maybe not.
	1) Most Wireless LAN driver live outside the kernel. So, their
evolution is somewhat decoupled to the kernel, so the earlier the
patch goes it the better it is for those.
	2) David Gibson, maintainer of the Orinoco driver, told me
that he would merge my new-API orinoco patches in his driver only when
the new API would be in 2.4.x (as you may have noticed, he hasn't
updated 2.5.X for a while). Chicken and Eggs.
	3) Risk is minimal, bloat is minimal. What's the penality of
merging it now ?
	I'm open to suggestions and will do what's best for
everybody. What other people think ?
	But I feel now is a good time (as it seem that 2.4.19 will
have to go through some stabilisation process).
	Thanks for the comment ;-)
	Jean
