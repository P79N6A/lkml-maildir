See REPORTING-BUGS for some hints. ethtool output before/after problem can
be added. It surprises me that the TX watchdog does not trigger if the device
stops working. Anything like a cron which could take place during the
5 minutes ? ifconfig and /proc/interrupts does not evolve any more once the
traffic is stopped ?
