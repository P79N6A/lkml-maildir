I wonder if this is a well-known problem. I have been using the 2.0.X
kernels on my home pc and now moved to 2.2.X. Libc is 5.4.46. Compiled
ppp-2.3.7 which worked fine in linux-2.0.X but not in linux-2.2.X. To be
more precise, chat didn't work in 2.2.9.
chat wrote "\rAT\r" to the modem, one character at a time, with
usleep(10000) between characters. In 2.0.37pre12 it then read from the modem
"\rAT\r\r\nOK" etc but in 2.2.9 just "\rAT\r" and nothing more.
It started working ok after I doubled the usleep. Why? (The modem did
receive the final \r also in 2.2.9 in case of usleep(10000) because it
echoed it. And in 2.0.X it works ok.)
It's a 486, 100 MHz. 16450, 115200 b/s to a USR Sportster Flash (V.90).
