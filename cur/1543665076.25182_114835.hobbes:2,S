I really appreciate the work you are doing on this project, but I have a
comment on how the output is being generated.
What I really need to know is, what are all of the reported errors in a
specific portion of the kernel tree.  If you give some way to search
based on filename and path, I think you will find a lot more people
using the results of this tool.  I know I would :)
Also, what advantage does signing up for a user account on the kbugs.org
site give you?
thanks,
