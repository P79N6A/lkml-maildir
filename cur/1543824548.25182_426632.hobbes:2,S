Yes, this has been reported by others too. I've been looking at
MSI code recently to fix an unrelated problem, and noticed that
the code has policies about vector reservation that prevent
what you're trying to do. I'm planning to clean up the MSI
code shortly (patches out hopefully by next week), and will
remove such policies since many people are trying to do this.
