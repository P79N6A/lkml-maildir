Is anyone succesfully using a FA311 card (or anthing with a NatSemi 
DP83815 chip?)
The natsemi.c driver in 2.4.0 (and the one from Donald Becker's site 
for 2.2.x)
Something seems to be handled incorrectly in the driver, because whenever 
I subject the card to moderate to heavy load (nfs does this most often),
I get errors about 'eth0: something Wicked Happened 0700'.
And usually after this happens a couple of times, the driver/card gets 
wedged and won't send/receive any more packets.
The fa31lx70 driver from Netgear's web site at least doesn't get wedged, 
but has really poor perfomance under heavy load.
