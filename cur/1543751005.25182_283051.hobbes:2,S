And if the user actually wants to use a flash key reader on his/her
system? Is it all that naive to turn on this option? What option would a
knowlegible user employ? Or do such readers peruse the entire kernel
source so they know that using the key reader will disable storage divices
on their USB? 
But I did make the point that this was fixed quickly, insofar as adding
"this will kill storage devices on USB" to the config constitutes a fix.
If it killed the CD burner I would have caught this myself, I only use the
attached disk for major backup... 
The idea that you would even imply that people turning this option on were
naive users, or that it would be done for no good reason, seems pretty far
from the truth in this case.
