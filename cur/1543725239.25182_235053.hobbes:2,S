This was previously discussed as the subject "proper bios handoff in 
ehci-hcd".  Basically it's a broken bios, and David Brownell has a fix for 
it that hasn't made it into the kernel yet.
Changing the "return 1" at line 308 in drivers/usb/host/ehci-hcd.c" to a 
"return 0" works for me until the patch makes it into the tree.
