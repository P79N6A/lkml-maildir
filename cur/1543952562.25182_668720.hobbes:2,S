The SDHCI spec doesn't specify how to detect the card, so this is a valid behaviour. That said, it's a very stupid way to detect cards as it is very unreliable. There's a reason extremely few use this technique.

Then you have broken hardware. The specs clearly state that the controller must be able to detect cards without powering up the cards. Also, the cards must implement the pull-up in a way that behaves like a resistor. So there should be no requirement for full power there either.

Yes, some wbsd controllers at least.

Provided your hardware is in fact so broken that it cannot be properly handled, you could add a quirk that forces the sdhci driver to keep power on constantly.

I have a faint memory of a pull-up being added to the MMC 4 spec (the ones with lots of pads). Still, it's a crappy detection mechanism as it doesn't play well with data transfers, and the pull-up can usually be disabled in the cards.
