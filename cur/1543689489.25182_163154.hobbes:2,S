It would be nice.  It is especially nice for vendors because they can reuse a single driver image for multiple architectures assuming there is an interpreter and EFI support.

Ok, so how do we know it is stable and how might one address that?  How have you addressed this with kexec?

Why?  I've missed this argument.   
The documentation has not been updated.  A recent RedHat

I'm afraid I haven't looked at kexec.  Do you employ the standard 32 bit entry point or do you actually go back to real mode or something in between?

I can see how this could be useful and potentially consolidate the efi related code in ia64, the ia32 stuff I've posted, and any other architecture that supports efi in the future, but don't know about compiling in multiple subarchs.  Comments on how this is done?
