Hello,
I'm porting a driver for a DAC board from 2.0 to 2.2. Since I'm learning
kernel programming as I do this, I have some questions about how to make
this driver SMP aware.
After reading this article, 
http://news.tucows.com/ext2/99/11/articles/ext2112919991.shtml,
 I was
left wondering about when to use the spinlocks.
A piece of code like this:
   for (i=0;i<count;i++)
      outb(*buf++, addr);
should be protected in all SMP instances? As in:
   spin_lock(&lock);
   for (i=0;i<count;i++)
      outb(*buf++, addr);
   spin_unlock(&lock);
How about:
   for (i=0;i<count;i++)
      *dest++ = inb(addr);
should a spinlock be placed here too?
Thanks.
