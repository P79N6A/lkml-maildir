I can add that our Red Hat customers who tried the cachefs preview did 
find it useful for their workloads (and, by the way, also use the 
Solaris cachefs on solaris boxes if I remember correctly).  They have 
been nagging me and others at Red Hat about getting it into supported 
state for quite a while :-)
As you point out, this is all about getting more clients to be driven by 
a set of NFS servers.
