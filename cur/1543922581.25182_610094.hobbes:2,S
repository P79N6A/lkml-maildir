This is the commandline they wanted to use, not the one that was
actually used. The one that was used should appear on the console, on
the serial console if they have the lead or in dmesg when the device
boots. We know it probably contained root=/dev/mtdblock2 but thats it.
I'd like to confirm which commandline is appearing since if we know
which one it is we might stand a chance of knowing where it came from,
until then this is just a guessing game.
Cheers,
Richard
