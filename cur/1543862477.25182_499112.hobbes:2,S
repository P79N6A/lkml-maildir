That's somewhat intentional - my aim was that the controllers
shouldn't really care whether they're connected to the default
hierarchy or have been bound to some mounted hierarchy. Having said
thay, they can determine it by checking <foo>_subsys.hierarchy if they
really want to. If that's 0 then they're in the default hierarchy (and
can assume that all tasks are in one top-level container).
