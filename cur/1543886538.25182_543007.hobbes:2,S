I've not had one accurate one on ARM yet.
Here's another example:
WARNING: init/built-in.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.text:
 from .text between 'rest_init' (at offset 0x4c) and 'run_init_process'
from init/main.c:
static void noinline rest_init(void)
        __releases(kernel_lock)
static void run_init_process(char *init_filename)
Clearly, it just does _not_ work.
