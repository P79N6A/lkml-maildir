I'm sorry -- perhaps I shouldn't have said that. The USB bugs were
actually the ones that did get attention. I overgeneralized, perhaps
because I'm frustrated with the amount of problems that I get with Linux
these days.
I went ahead and retested all of my known USB problems against
2.4.22-pre5. It seems all usb-storage ones are gone, and there is only
one bluetooth showstopper, fairly simple to reproduce:
1. boot the machine (using uhci)
2. insert a PCI BCM2033-based bluetooth adapter, observe the firmware
   getting loaded, don't actually bring the hci0 interface up,
3. remove the adapter, everything looks fine
4. try to rmmod uhci and get:
  kmem_cache_destroy: Can't free all objects c12c7b40
  uhci: not all urb_priv's were freed
