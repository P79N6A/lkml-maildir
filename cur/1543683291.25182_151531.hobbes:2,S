Hello all,
	I noticed that there are two implementations of TCP and UDP in the kernel - 
one for IPv4 and the other for IPv6. Correct me if I am wrong, but wouldn't 
it be better to just have one implementation for both versions of IP? I know 
this for sure:
1) it would decrease the size of the kernel (this wouldn't be too dramatic, 
but still)
2) it would make maintaining of the code half the work
AFAIK there are small differences in TCP and UDP between IPv4 and IPv6, but 
they could be resolved using simple "work arounds."
Thanks,
Jeff.
