Use schedule_work() to push it into a worker thread.
While letting a worker thread sleep for 500ms is also not nice,
it's better than doing it in an interrupt. The best but also
most complicated solution is to set up a timer using add_timer
for this, but this quickly gets you into state machine hell.
