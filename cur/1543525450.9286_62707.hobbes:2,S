Your right. Actually only the bttv.c driver uses that function.  This
means the bttv driver doesn't work on Sparc stations. Anyone actually
tried it on a Sparc/Alpha station? Of course using the new pci interface
means it doesn't belong in vmalloc.c. This means also that different
versions would need to exist for each type of bus. Now will other drivers
need this code? Right now only bttv.c needs it. So should those function
be placed in bttv.c and fixed with what you suggested or develope a bunch
of interfaces to kvirt_to_{pci,zorro,etc} and place this in the bus code.
