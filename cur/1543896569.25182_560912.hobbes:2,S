It's this simple, those who chose the GPLv2 for Linux and their
contributions to it don't want people to create derivative works of their
works that can't be Tivoized. They see this as a feature, and it's the
reason they're not willing to adopt GPLv3. (They want people who receive
derivative works of their programs to get all the GPLv2 rights, not just
some of them.)
I don't see any compromise that means that people don't get all the rights
to Linux that the GPLv2 grants as working.
