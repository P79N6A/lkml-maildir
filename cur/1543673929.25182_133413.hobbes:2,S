Alan:
I think I misread your message. Is there a per port resume
indication? (I'm at home and don't have the specs in front
of me) I was thinking of the global USBSTS_RD bit.
If you can qualify the global USBSTS_RD bit with a per
port resume indication on a non OC port, then it might
make sense to do this on the wakeup side.
Pro: you could suspend the controller when appropriate
without interference from the OC ports
Con: you would be generating a lot of spurious interrupts
as the global USBSTS_RD is set (incorrectly) by the OC ports.
Even though you would not actually do the wake, you still
burn cycles servicing the false interrupts.
So my inclination is still to nab this on the suspend side.
