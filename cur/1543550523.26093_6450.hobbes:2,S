m68k uses interrupt levels, so an interrupt with a higher priority can
interrupt another interrupt with a lower priority. To make things more
interesting several m68k machines don't have a seperate external interrupt
controller, so they rely on that the interrupt level isn't lowered during
an interrupt (the ide driver has an ide__sti() because of this).
I can imagine that newer lowend embedded targets have similiar problems
(on the other end I'm just looking at the s390 interrupt code which looks
also interesting).
bye, Roman
