Exactly as you write. Sorry for my previous bad definitions.

Correct.

For instance.
Ok, so how to deal with these devices? Does anybody have some idea? That's
what I was talking about somewhere in the beginning of this thread, the raw
values, because it seems too specific for letting kernel to cope with each
of these devices separately, but there might be a better idea in somebody's
head? But raw is ugly...
