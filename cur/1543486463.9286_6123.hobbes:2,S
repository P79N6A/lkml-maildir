To have a substitute task get woken with a signal just needs something
like:
pseudo-diff against kernel/sched.c, line 670 in 2.2.1
        switch (prev->state) {
                case TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE:
                        if (signal_pending(prev)) {
                                prev->state = TASK_RUNNING;
                                break;
                        }
+                       /* fall through */
+               case TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE:
+                       if (prev->substitute) {
+                               spin_unlock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
+                               kill_proc(prev->substitute,
+                                         prev->substitute_sig, 0);
+                               spin_lock_irq(&runqueue_lock);
+                               prev->subsitute = 0;
+                       }
+                       /* fall through */
                default:
                        del_from_runqueue(prev);
                case TASK_RUNNING:
        }
Plus a new prctl option to set the substitute and substitute_sig for a
task. Probably support for passing the pid of the about-to-sleep task
to the substitute as signal info would be nice also.
Is this actually useful? Well, the cost of the kill_proc is low; we're
about to do a task switch anyway.
For the userspace thread scheduler Jamie mentions, the substitute
thread upon waking just calls the scheduler. It will even allow you
attempt to do work while the original thread suffers a page-in. It
should also be straightforward to implement a async IO API on top of
it. The thread returning from the call to initiate IO may be a
different task from the one that called it, but I think all the
problems this causes can be worked around.
