Also you can use a MBR lilo that only boots one or more partitions, then
have Lilo installed on each partition to select a specific kernel related
to that particular partition. This way you no longer have to update a
single point of failure - only update the lilo configuration on a specific
partition when changes are needed.
You avoid altering the MBR and the other partition.
