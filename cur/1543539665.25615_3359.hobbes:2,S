Yes.

There doesn't seem to be such on VIA and AMD chipsets. Most other
chipsets have the support.

Fortunately all UDMA transfers are protected by safe enough CRC to see
if a transfer fails. This way you can know your cable won't do UDMA/66
and switch to something slower. (UDMA/44 seems to work on most 40-wire
cables just fine). If that doesn't work, go even lower. Something like
modem autobauding ...

Yes.
