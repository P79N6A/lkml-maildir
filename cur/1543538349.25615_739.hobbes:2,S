I'm trying to understand the differences between the three zones, ZONE_DMA,
ZONE_NORMAL,and ZONE_HIGHMEM.  I've searched the source code (I'm getting pretty
good at understanding the kernel memory allocator), but I can't figure out what
physical regions of memory belong to each zone.  Where is that determined?
Also, I get this eerie feeling that it's possible for a physical page to exist
in more than one zone.  Is that true?
