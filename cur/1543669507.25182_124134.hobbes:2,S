Probably, but I'm running testing (I like it to at least -mostly- work
;) ..) and still would prefer the 2.3.1 patches.  (Among other things,
its easier to test changes if you do them in small batches; a libc
upgrade from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2 is hardly 'small'. And the 2.3.2 changelog
doesn't mention sysenter specifically, although I haven't read it in 
detail to see if its mentioned obliquely.)
Since the binaries are being distributed there, I had expected to find
sources in the same place.. or at least -somewhere-..
