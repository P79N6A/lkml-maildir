Nothing to worry about anymore. There were some matroxfb ones 
(oopses at boot only when actively using matroxfb, for instance) 
but also a ton of non-video related stuff: whenever one thing got 
fixed, something had been broken in the mean time. Some of it still 
not solved, by the way, (aha152x anyone?).
The matrox oopses were solved already before I applied Petr's 
matroxfb-2.5.72.gz patch.
