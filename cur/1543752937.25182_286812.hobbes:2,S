It's used for the "accumulative bogomips". To quote Alan:

But taking it away doesn't help because the timer startup on the BP
and the secondaries going into the idle loop isn't synchronized.
You could add a synchronization step, but it would be far more
complicated than fixing the ordering like I did.
