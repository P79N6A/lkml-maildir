Thanks for your replies, guys. I will follow your advices.
Moreover, in my case, I need to write a function that atomically moves a
contiguous range of blocks from one range to another (on the same device).
If you think it may be used by anything outside my need (BFS is a
contiguous filesystem so to extend a file beyond the currently allocated
last block it *may* have to move it to a gap) then I can put it in
fs/buffer.c and export it instead of making static to my module.
But for now I will make it static to my module.
Regards,
