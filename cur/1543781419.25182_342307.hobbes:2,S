The bisection search:
a46e812620bd7db457ce002544a1a6572c313d8a good
e0b98c79e605f64f263ede53344f283f5e0548be good
fd3113e84e188781aa2935fbc4351d64ccdd171b good
2757a71c3122c7653e3dd8077ad6ca71efb1d450 good
ba17101b41977f124948e0a7797fdcbb59e19f3e good, this one has got more testing,
as my default kernel to boot for the moment.
saw lots of drm recompile for the next one:
561fb765b97f287211a2c73a844c5edb12f44f1d bad
6ade43fbbcc3c12f0ddba112351d14d6c82ae476 good
I'll test this one more to see if it is a false positive, and I'll
also test a known bad kernel without DRM.
