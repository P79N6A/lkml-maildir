With this patch there is a stunning difference with the no swap
prefetch case on my system. With previous  SP the difference was
around 2 seconds, now is more than 7 seconds.
Swap Prefetch OFF
# ./sp_tester
Ram 776388000  Swap 514040000
Total ram to be malloced: 1033408000 bytes
Starting first malloc of 516704000 bytes
Starting 1st read of first malloc
Touching this much ram takes 1642 milliseconds
Starting second malloc of 516704000 bytes
Completed second malloc and free
Sleeping for 60 seconds
Important part - starting reread of first malloc
Completed read of first malloc
Timed portion 9089 milliseconds
