Well, that is good... I guess ;)
Actually the patches I have sent you do fix real bugs, but they also
make the block layer less likely to recurse into page reclaim, so it
may be eg. hiding the problem that Neil's patch fixes.
It may be that your fundamental problem is solved by my patches, but
we need to be sure.

obviously my patches backed out. Thanks for sticking with it.
