Users can create executables. Some will be non-functional
unless specially marked by an admin.
What is the goal here? I see no reasonable goal that would
result in such a policy.

When you go that route, you may need to abandon libc. I've done exactly
that for one emulator. It was not easy. Nearly nobody will want to go
down that path.
Things improve a bit if MAP_ANONYMOUS and SysV shared mem allocations
can be made to ignore the available memory checking. If I could allocate
a 2 GB chunk on a system with 1 GB total swap+RAM, then I could use
that as an area in which to perform MAP_FIXED allocations. As of now
this would require either adding the swap space or disabling the
available memory checking system-wide via sysctl.

It's highly unlikely that such breakage would cause corruption.
Most likely it would cause the database to exit with an error
about failing to attach to a SysV shared memory segment.
I believe that a major cause of reboots is that admins are
unaware of SysV shared memory cruft left behind by apps that
crashed at the wrong moment or had other bugs. If something
is eating memory and you don't know what it is, you reboot.

Well NONE of this stuff is absolutely required to run a JIT,
and one doesn't even need a JIT if one likes pure emulation.
All of this is about optimization and failure clean-up.
MAP_ANONYMOUS and SysV shared mem are good for transient things.
Sometimes a JIT author wants to keep a persistent image on disk.
In this case, it is much better to use the disk as backing store.
Also, sometimes one prefers to use a specific filesystem because
swap may be slower, smaller, or of unknown quality.
BTW, a mdup2 is great for DSP algorithms as well. It can allow
for wrap-around arrays, greatly simplifying and speeding up
things like filters.
