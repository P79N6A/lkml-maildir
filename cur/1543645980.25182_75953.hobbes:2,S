But EVMS would be an excellent substitute in the mean time.
Better to having something excellent now than something perfect but
too late.
The EVMS guys have done a great job of cleanly integrating with 2.5,
the single additional interface they needed to add to genhd.c is
testament to their consideration of these issues.
IBM seem to have done a great job creating the most extensive and
complete logical volume manager for Linux (including a suite of end
user tools much more extensive than LVM). They have also shown the
commitment to keep it current and cleary are way further ahead than
any other contender. It would be horrible if not getting the nod from
the right friends deprived users of a *complete* logical volume manager
in 2.5 anytime soon.
Peace, love and Linux ;)
