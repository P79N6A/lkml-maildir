By PM (guess he's scared to post to this thread ;) Chris is telling
me, what you mean perhaps is I should add a From: Christoph in the
body of the email if the first signed-off-by is from Christoph, to
indicate the first signoff was by him and the patch in turn was
started by him. I thought the order of the signoffs was enough, but if
that From was mandatory and missing, if there's any error it obviously
wasn't intentional especially given I only left a signed-off-by:
christoph on his patches until he asked me to add my signoff
too. Correcting it is trivial given I carefully ordered the signoff so
that the author is at the top of the signoff list.
At least for mmu-notifier-core given I obviously am the original
author of that code, I hope the From: of the email was enough even if
an additional From: andrea was missing in the body.
Also you can be sure that Christoph and especially Robin (XPMEM) will
be more than happy if all patches with Christoph at the top of the
signed-off-by will be merged in 2.6.26 despite there wasn't From:
christoph at the top of the body ;). So I don't see a big deal here...
