Yes, of course.

That seems to support my suspicion that something is doing unaligned
accesses of static data.

There is probably some function after ipt_unregister_table in the
source code that is not being exported from the object file.

Disassemble (objdump -s) the module and look for load or store
instructions with the same page offset as the reported pc value, in
this case 0x17d8.  You'll want to compile with debugging symbols so
you get the function names printed even for static functions.
Another thing is to look for casts to (int *) or (long *) in the
source code.  There's often one somewhere close to the unaligned
access.  You might also check where static data is being accessed.
Depending on the amount of static data and the number of accesses this
might be more trouble than it's worth.
BTW, which kernel version is this?
