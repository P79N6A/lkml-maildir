This problem doesn't exist, because linux users don't need to
use ECN if they don't want to.  It is optional!  Those who
*care* about hotmail etc. can turn it off!  The only ones who get
ECN turned on is those who compile their own kernels.  They
have the skill to turn it off if they need.  The
distributions don't ship kernels with ECN default on.
