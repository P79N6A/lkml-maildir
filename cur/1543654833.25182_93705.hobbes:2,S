I'd say both. Be careful not to file duplicates in Bugzilla though.
People attatching patches to existing bugs in Bugzilla are especially
welcome ;-)
Bugs will get closed out once they're fixed in the next full release
of mainline, so Bugzilla shouldn't get too cluttered. We need to have
a better (more searchable) version field, but that needs some more
complex Bugzilla rework ... we're thinking about how best to do it.
