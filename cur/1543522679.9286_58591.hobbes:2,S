At a glance I'd say there may be some issues with trying to get multiple
adapters detected in a particular order.  Otherwise it looks fine.
I had a report a couple years ago of one machine which supposedly allows you to
plug in MCA, ISA, EISA, and PCI (possibly more) at the same time.  It's vaguely
possible that I still have the e-mail floating around one of my many inboxes if
it's really important.
Unless someone else can back me up on it (I imagine that if such a strange
machine exists outside of the imagination of the sender of the mentioned e-mail,
someone on linux-kernel would have heard of it), I'd suggest breaking MCA/ISA
cooexistance. They're incompatible by design and anyone who's managed to beat
them into cooperating should also be bright enough to fix/break the source
themselves.
