You can't without copying info from one stack to another. There are
other problems, also, the only place you can get data for a stack in the
kernel dynamically is from kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC). Other kmalloc() data
are paged which may (will) cause a double-fault if you use it for
a stack. You are not going to get much more than a page of GFP_ATOMIC
data so you can't really make a larger stack than the existing
process/kernel stack.
I have tried to just allocate data when a module is installed (in the
.bss or .data segments as static data). Unfortunately, some kernel
code traps this as a "triple fault" if I try to use it for a stack,
even though the kernel segments for ES, SS, DS, all point to the
same area(s).
I think the purpose of compressing the stack was to get rid of
NDIS, but that's only a theory. Currently, they did a good job
of it!
