Open source drivers are important to ensure compatibility between
builds of the Linux kernel (whoops does that look like remarkably
similar to your own argument) since we thereby are sure that API
changes gets noticed and fixed in drivers actually being used.
Binary only modules on the other hand are a major problem because
vendors are almost always extremely slow in updating their code thus
you end up kludging old kernels in order to use a particular binary
module. A good example here is AFS from Transarc, though they seem to
have gotten better. Of course you just claim that we should just set
an API in stone and stick to that, but that doesn't work, sometimes we
_have_ to change the API to solve a bug.
Sorry but your two weeks study of the Linux development model doesn't
seem to have tought you much. So far all I can see is that your are
turning it into insulting people because you don't seem to have an
argument that can convince them.
