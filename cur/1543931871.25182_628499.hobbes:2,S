Could this patch still make it in?
Yes, I think its set() and get() parts should use bytes and convert 
to/from pages.

Perhaps just round up, and mention the rounding in the manpage, so that 
noone gets a shock when the pipe is not exactly as small as requested.

How big can a pipe become? k*alloc has a certain limit, so should 
perhaps vmalloc be used for when kalloc fails?
