As long as the low-level driver can be unloaded, that's sufficient for 
hardware- and device-hotplug.

Just general refcounting / module support code.

The PCI API is a hotplug API.  Whether the underlying controller is 
hotpluggable or not is largely irrelevant to low-level drivers.

That's completely irrelevant.  libata and the IDE core work without 
change on x86 and non-x86 systems.

All platforms should be considered hotplug.
