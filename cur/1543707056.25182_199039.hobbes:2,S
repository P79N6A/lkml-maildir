Most embedded people till now just _abused_ ide_init_default_hwifs() :-(.

No, it is not the "correct" way.

No, unfortunately.

Yep.  Please take a look at drivers/ide/arm/icside.c.
It is well written, quite simple and has DMA support.
If you have any questions/issues feel free to ask
on linux-ide@vger.kernel.org mailing list.
