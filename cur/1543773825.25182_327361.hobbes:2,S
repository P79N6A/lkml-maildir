This is not a performance critical piece of code at all.  It's used to
walk devices and drivers and busses at device insertion and removal
time, and at module load and unload.  All of which are not bottlenecks
in benchmarks :)
Now if people want to use this for performance critical stuff, that
would be a different story.  But the odds that they would be doing this
with kobjects would be very slim...
