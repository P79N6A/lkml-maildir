Dear All,
I'am planning to use linux  2.6 ipsec for an vpn design with an
embedded powerpc (mpc85xx) family. Basic routing performance looks
pretty for the system with 2.6.16.20 kernel
---------------------------------------------------
Basic routing performance on ppc85xx
64Byte packets:         230680 pps
512 Byte packets:       176221 pps
1518 Byte packets:      77617 pps
---------------------------------------------------
Software AES 256 ipsec tunnel mode routing performance (with manual keyying):
64Byte packets:      55059pps (-%76 lesser then normal routing)
512 Byte packets:   23496 pps (-%87 lesser then routing)
1518 Byte packets:  8533 pps (-%90  lesser then  routing)
-----------------------------------------------------
I know software encryption/ decryption affects system performance
alot, but isn't %90 decreasement  so much for this effect?
Is there any ipsec performance benchmark  with same of different
platform, or anyting wrong with my tests?
Thanks alot for the responses..
Regads
