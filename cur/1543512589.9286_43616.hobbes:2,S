I think you are right, I see no case where a normal semaphore would
lock-up and the rw semaphore would not lock up.
we win something _if_ vm_ops->swapout() is extremely slow:
* with lock_kernel() [ie currently], multiple threads can sleep within
vm_ops->swapout() of the same "struct mm"
* an rw-semaphore would mimic that behaviour.
* a normal semaphore would prevent that.
I'm not sure if it is worth to implement a rw-semaphore, especially
since we win something in a very obscure case, but we loose cpu-cycles
for every down_rw()/up_rw() [there is no 2 asm-instruction rw-semaphore]
