Hmmm.. If I separately allocate the kobject then I can no longer get to 
the kmem_cache structure from the kobject. 
I need to add a second kobject_del to sysfs_slab_remove() to make sysfs 
completely forget about the object?
Probably should track down any remaining symlinks at that point and nuke 
them too. Isnt there some way to convince sysfs to remove the symlinks 
if the target vanishes?
