Since IRQ0 is not valid, can we arrange for the generic interrupt
infrastructure to always fail it's allocation, and then remove the
utterly unused bloatful irq_desc[0] ?
Didn't think so since x86 folk would scream.  Wait a moment, x86 can
map IRQ0 to some other number for the timer interrupt, just like
other architectures are being forced to map their UART interrupts.
