This is of course an interesting idea, but: fsck backends are really
different between them, they do not share any code... Dump backends would
be 90% identical, so I'm not so sure that adding new filesystem types would
complicate the common code...

Keeping compatibility is of course very important.

I'm not sure if Linux can boot on a tape drive, and how to deal with this.
But it would surely be a good idea to implement this. If only I had the 
time :)...
