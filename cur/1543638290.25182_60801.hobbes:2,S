How about export the value via a syscall and also export an 'error'
which for now could just be set to 5% or something conservative and
refined later if necessary or cleanup on other architectures,
something like:
    /* export monotonically increasing nanoseconds since boot to
       user-space. kt_time is a relative value, it does NOT necessarily
       imply nanoseconds since boot. kt_err should be greater than
       1stdev of the error in kt_time */
    struct kern_time {
	  __u64 kt_ns;
	  __u64 kt_err;
    };
