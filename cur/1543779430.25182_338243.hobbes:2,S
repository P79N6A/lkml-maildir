Maybe you==SGI typically use other time sources, but most other
ia64 boxes have synchronized ITCs.  There's no reason such machines
should have to use the slower and lower precision HPET.

And why should everyday users have to be concerned with "nojitter"?

The "ITC deficiency" is a platform design issue.  Most small SMP platforms
*do* synchronize the clocks of all processors.  Obviously that's difficult
on large boxes, and then you may need extra timers in the platform.
