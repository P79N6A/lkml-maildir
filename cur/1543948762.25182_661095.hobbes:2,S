Ah, OK. That wasn't clear to me.
If it's not a regression, tracing the problem will be much harder.
The best way to start is probably just to google to see if other people with 
the same laptop or video controller have the same issues (and maybe 
solutions). Look for installation reports for your laptop model for 
example.

I have had LCD/VRT switching issues with my laptop as well (a Toshiba 
Satellite A40). The Fn key did always work, but the output after switching 
would be garbled and I could not switch back. This was finally fixed about 
a year ago with the new Intel drivers and xrandr 1.2.
Your problem may be totally different though and could possibly be related 
to the function keys, or indeed to the BIOS.
Note that some laptops need special kernel modules or user space programs to 
be loaded for the Fn keys to be supported. Have you checked for that?
