Just my $0.02
FreeBSD 4.0 should be out soon, if not already.  Why don't you bench mark
against that?  I'll be running similar benchmarks as well, but I'm very much
interested in your results though.  So if you could, PLEASE, remember me
when you release your report it'll be greatly appreciated.  I'll also let
you know of my results (Don't expect it any time soon though) :)
cheers
