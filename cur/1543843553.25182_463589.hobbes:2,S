There very few tracepoints in this category, the only things you can
claim are more or less generic are syscalls, and tracing syscall
handling is tricky.

This is grossly over simplifying things and why the whole things doesn't
hold water. There is no such thing as 'the place' to put a specific
tracepoint.
Especially when we start talking about things like tracepoints in the
scheduler.
Note that I haven't been referring to debug tracepoints at any point in
this debate.

Your distinction above doesn't hold water, but I did understand it
very well ....
You seem to think that it's fine to add instrumentation in the syscall
path as an example as long as it's compiled out. Well on some
architectures, the syscall path is very sensitive to alignment and there
may be restrictions on how large the stub of code is allowed to be, like
a few hundred bytes. Just because things work one way on x86, doesn't
mean they work like that everywhere.
