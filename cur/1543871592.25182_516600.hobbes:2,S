I'd prefer i2c-blackfin-gpio and i2c-blackfin-twi. Abreviations tend to
confuse newcomers.

Please move the entries to the right location. The list is sorted
alphabetically if you didn't notice.

You can drop the trailing "I2C support", the user is in a menu named
"I2C hardware bus support" so it's pretty clear what we're talking
about.

No default for the other cases?

I2C_BLACKFIN_SCL
Etc etc, all the options should start with I2C_BLACKFIN.

"SCL GPIO pin number"

Trailing whitespace, and many more after that. Please fix them all!

This should really not be a kernel configuration option. Please turn it
into a kernel module parameter or a sysfs attribute if you really need
it. Also note that we already have an interface to change this
value from user-space (using an ioctl on /dev/i2c-N) and that might be
sufficient for your needs.
And allowing 1 usec delay is probably not a good idea, I don't
recommend values below 6 usec with i2c-algo-bit.

Why don't you use "range" here too to ensure that the value is actually
less than 400? Either way, same as above, IMHO this should not be a
compilation-time decision.
A kHz is really 1000 Hz, not 1024. And everybody skilled enough to
configure a kernel should know that, I doubt it's worth reminding.

All these options won't work really well until you also change
drivers/i2c/busses/Makefile to make something useful with them...
