mii-tool -F 100baseTx-FD eth0
does not work in 2.5 while working fine in 2.4.
What should I do? Fix eth driver?
Use never mii-tool or equivalent?

Dave, Arnaldo, I can attempt to fix this if you think
it's feasible to receive my possibly buggy newcomer code
instead of fixing it yourself. In this case, feel free
to apply a cluebat as to what should be done / where should
I look for example of 'new protocol handler' ;)
I know that plans are underway to push all this stuff to early
userspace but I need it *now* if I want to test 2.5 at this time.
I suspect you already seen these lines of code,
but here they are (2.5.47):
net/core/dev.c:
static int deliver_to_old_ones(struct packet_type *pt,
                               struct sk_buff *skb, int last)
{
        int ret = NET_RX_DROP;
        if (!last) {
                skb = skb_clone(skb, GFP_ATOMIC);
                if (!skb)
                        goto out;
        }
        if (skb_is_nonlinear(skb) && skb_linearize(skb, GFP_ATOMIC))
                goto out_kfree;
#if CONFIG_SMP
        /* Old protocols did not depened on BHs different of NET_BH and
           TIMER_BH - they need to be fixed for the new assumptions.
         */
        print_symbol("fix old protocol handler %s!\n", (unsigned long)pt->func);
#endif
net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:
...
static int ic_bootp_recv(struct sk_buff *skb, struct net_device *dev, struct packet_type *pt);
static struct packet_type bootp_packet_type __initdata = {
        .type = __constant_htons(ETH_P_IP),
        .func = ic_bootp_recv,
};
...
static int __init ic_bootp_recv(struct sk_buff *skb, struct net_device *dev, struct packet_type *pt)
{
        struct bootp_pkt *b = (struct bootp_pkt *) skb->nh.iph;
        struct iphdr *h = &b->iph;
        struct ic_device *d;
        int len;
        /* One reply at a time, please. */
        spin_lock(&ic_recv_lock);
        /* If we already have a reply, just drop the packet */
        if (ic_got_reply)
                goto drop;
