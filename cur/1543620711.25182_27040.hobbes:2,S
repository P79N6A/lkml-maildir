This program compiles and works here. I'm using
RH 7.2, but the vtund setup hasn't changed from
my RH 7.1 setup.
Have you successfully installed vtund and tun?
Make sure your kernel-headers package is newer
than 2.4.7 - maybe grab the rawhide kernel headers
package which is IIRC 2.4.17 -
The old kernel headers package (2.4.2) won't work
or allow compiling of current version of vtund.
