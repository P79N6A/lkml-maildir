Sorry, I guess I explained it wrong.  Ethertap has an IP address assigned to the
device in the linux kernel.  It is then configured with a point to point route
to another IP address on the other concepual end of the link (ie in userspace). 
It is this other IP address that I am proxy arping for.
Thus, 
[mtc@10.40.14.70 mtc]$ /sbin/ip add
<stuff removed>
4: tap0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue
    link/ether fe:fd:00:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.40.14.73 peer 10.40.14.74/32 brd 10.40.14.255 scope global tap0
[mtc@10.40.14.70 mtc]$ /sbin/ip ro
10.40.14.74 dev tap0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.40.14.73
<stuff removed>
[mtc@10.40.14.70 mtc]$ /sbin/arp
Address                 HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
<stuff removed
10.40.14.74             *       *                   MP                    eth1
Thus, anyone arping for 10.40.14.74 (which is on top of a protocol stack in
userspace) will get the MAC address of eth1 as a response.
I cannot turn on proxy arping for the interface in general as I have eth0 and
eth1 on the same subnet and turning on proxy arping causes bad things to
happen.  Thus I have a single manual proxy entry in the arp table.
