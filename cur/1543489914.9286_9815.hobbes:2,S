If so don't write kernel code ;).

RAM is not a disk. Seek time is zero (a part the L1/L2 cache issues), so
the _only_ reason to defrag the memory is to make the system to work and
avoid to fail-and-try-leather.

Simply never request more than 1 page of contiguous space and you'll work
fine just now. If you are worried by the stack (never harmed here) just
vmalloc if get_free_pages fails and change the drivers that will use the
stack to do DMA on it. Or if you have plenty of ram you only need to
statically alloc 4mbyte for the stacks of 512 tasks and don't use the VM
at all to provide a stack to a process.
