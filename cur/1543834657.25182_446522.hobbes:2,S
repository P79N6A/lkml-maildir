Actually going by the faq
(
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.4/capfaq-0.2.txt
)
it seems like the cap_intersect with current->cap_inheritable is *too*
limiting.  I haven't checked what the posix draft actually says, but the
bprm->cap_inheritable is called the 'forced' set, and is supposed to be
like setuid.
I suspect the reason why removing the cap_combine worked for you is
because when the file is setuid 0, the bprm->cap_permitted is also set
full on.  For people actually using one of the patches implementing
filesystem capabilities, I think you might in fact change behavior.
