Hi!
Yesterday I tried to setup a system with RAID0 + crypto + xfs + lvm2..
I've done this:
mkraid /dev/md0
losetup -e aes /dev/loop0 /dev/md0
mkfs.xfs /dev/md0
and bang, after a few secs, it crashed the kernel with just one line
(sorry, I can't copy it, it's a production server, and it's not so good
when you have to go to the coloc facility at 4am ;))
I just wanted to inform you, and probably somebody can test it...
Regards,
