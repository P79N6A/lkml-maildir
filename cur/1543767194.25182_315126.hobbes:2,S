Yah, so what I am asking is why not use inotify for the user-side
component of this system?
Wouldn't the deferring and coalescing of events occur on the server
side?  So the server-side stuff would be whatever you need--your own
code using whatever protocol you wanted--but the client-side interface
would be over inotify.
Even if not, I'd be willing to make changes to inotify to accommodate
NFS's needs.
