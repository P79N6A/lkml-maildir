This function:
static inline struct page *page_cache_alloc(struct address_space *x)
{
	if (cpuset_mem_spread_check()) {
		int n = cpuset_mem_spread_node();
		return alloc_pages_node(n, mapping_gfp_mask(x), 0);
	}
	return alloc_pages(mapping_gfp_mask(x), 0);
}
Really has two forms, depending upon Kconfig.
1:
static inline struct page *page_cache_alloc(struct address_space *x)
{
	return alloc_pages(mapping_gfp_mask(x), 0);
}
That should be inlined.
2:
static inline struct page *page_cache_alloc(struct address_space *x)
{
	if (cpuset_mem_spread_check()) {
		int n = cpuset_mem_spread_node();
		return alloc_pages_node(n, mapping_gfp_mask(x), 0);
	}
	return alloc_pages(mapping_gfp_mask(x), 0);
}
That shouldn't be inlined.
That's all.   One would have to fiddle a bit, work out how many callsites
there are, gauge the impact on text size, etc.  page_cache_alloc() seems
to have a single callsite, and page_cache_alloc_cold() four, so it's
a quite minor issue.
