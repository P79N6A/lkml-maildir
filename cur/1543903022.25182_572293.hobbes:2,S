Correct, if the pgdat is already allocated on the node you're adding,
then you shouldn't hit this path. I've been toying with the hotplug code
for handoffs of small SRAM blocks (transitioning between exclusive
application usage and letting the kernel manage it as a node), which can
reliably follow this path. It's managed to find a couple of oopses in
this area at least, this not being the first :-)
