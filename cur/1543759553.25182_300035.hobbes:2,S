I often use a simple trick to make my single file patches compatible
with both -p0 and -p1 :
diff -pruN ./dir/file.orig ./dir/file.new
The './' can either get stripped by -p1 or left as is, thus the patch
works for different scripts or people. The main disadvantage is that
there's no base version indication in the patch with this method.
