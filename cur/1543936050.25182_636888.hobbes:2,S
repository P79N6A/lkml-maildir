Sam (or anyone :),
I guess that I'm a little confused.  Instead of changing
variable names to match the modpost whitelist, I tested adding
__init_refok or __initdata_refok to these (driver) structs that
generated the modpost warnings.
Example:  drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c
--- linux-2.6.24-rc7-git1.orig/drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c
+++ linux-2.6.24-rc7-git1/drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c
@@ -611,7 +611,7 @@ static __devexit void tpm_inf_pnp_remove
 	}
 }
 
-static struct pnp_driver tpm_inf_pnp = {
+static struct pnp_driver __init_refok tpm_inf_pnp = {
 	.name = "tpm_inf_pnp",
 	.driver = {
 		.owner = THIS_MODULE,
This has a build warning with my toolchain:
  CC      drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.o
linux-2.6.24-rc7-git1/drivers/char/tpm/tpm_infineon.c:614: warning: 'noinline' attribute ignored
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:2315: Warning: setting incorrect section attributes for .text.init.refok
but otherwise no section mismatch warning.
OTOH, using __initdata_refok has no build warning and no section
mismatch warning... but it (__initdata_refok) doesn't make sense
to me.  Should it (make sense/be used)?
Is there a __refok that should be used here, instead of having
to modify variable names?
