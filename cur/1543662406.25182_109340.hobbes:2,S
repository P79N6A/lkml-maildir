I know. There's memory corruption going on somewhere, but I'm not sure
exactly where.

Also known. It's a bit odd really: the reads fail due to some form of
corruption, but the writes are OK. Means that when you later come to
compare the '.fsxgood' file to the 'bad' file, then things look OK.
I'm a bit confused w.r.t. both these issues. Neither occur on the
2.4.x platform despite the fact that the code is more or less the
same. This is why I suspect an IPv4 socket problem.
Cheers,
