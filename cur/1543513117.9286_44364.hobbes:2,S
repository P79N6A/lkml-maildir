Yes, arping from iputils can do that.
And since a userlevel tool exists, the point for the kernel level detection is
mood. If you want to verify that the IP address isn't in use yet before you
ifconfig it, thats fine, modify your scripts. (Also totally prevents the
possibility of getting flooded (as Alan pointed out), since the verification
is only done on request).
But duplicate address detection in the kernel is just not necessary.
