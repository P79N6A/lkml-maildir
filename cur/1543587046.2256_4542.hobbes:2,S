Hi guys,
I have seen several messages posted to l-k about people reporting
processes (mozilla most of the time) hanging in the D state in 2.4.3,
but I haven't seen someone posting a possible explanation or solution 
to the problem.
Anyone knows where does the problem lie, or a workaround for the
problem? I hate going through the fsck that happens when umount fails
because processes are in the D state...
Cheers!
Eloy.-
