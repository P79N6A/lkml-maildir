Sure. But this isn't the "wait=1" case. In the waiting case, we don't need 
to allocate anything at all, we can just use the stack.
So the only case that matters for interrupts is indeed "wait=0", but 
that's very much also the case we're talking about.

Yes. I agree that the _concept_ of the patch is good. No argument there. 
I'm just worried about the details.

This misses a _lot_ of cases. What about this one:
	kernel/relay.c:                 err = smp_call_function_single(i,
where you're not seeing if it's a non-waiting one or not (it's a waiting 
one, but my point is that your grep is missing cases).
Doing
	git grep -w smp_call_function_single | grep -v '1);'
is probably more likely to find the cases to look for.
But you're right, I'm still not seeing anything that looks _likely_ to be 
a problem. But I worry that it's something somebody may want to do.
