Hi Buddy,
Even for systems that don't *need* the extra memory space, swap can
actually provide performance improvements by allowing unused memory
to be replaced with often-used memory.
For example, I have 57MB swapped right now. It allows me to instantly
grep the kernel tree. If I turned swap off, each grep would probably
take 30 seconds.
The VM doesn't always get it right, and to make matters worse, desktop
users don't appreciate their long running jobs finishing earlier, but
*hate* having to wait a few seconds for a window to appear if it hasn't
been used for 24 hours.

I think the comment was rather directed at a specific problem you
described:

This sounds like you are having a serious problem, and it would be
great if you could describe it in detail. kernel version, workload,
description of the system, vmstat output, etc.
Let's keep it nice.
Best regards
