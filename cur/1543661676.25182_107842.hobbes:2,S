   I fail to see how the statement "skb->len + skb->data_len" has any
   usable meaning, or how it can be anything other than a bug.
This equation is the standard way to find the full length
on any skb.  For linear skbs, data_len is always zero.
I asked Alan to use this formula so that greps on the source
tree would always show data_len being taken into account, and
thus usage would be consistent.
