Hi folks,
Do you know if there are any good patches for kernel 2.2.5-15 that
would allow me to simulate packet loss/out of order arrival of packets
in TCP connections?  I was going to write something like this myself,
but then again it's probably already done by someone...
I'd appreciate your help.
Stan
