What are the changes a large allocation will actually succeed?
Is there an alignment rule for large allocations?
E.g. for one of the PS3 drivers I need a physically contiguous 256 KiB-aligned
block of 256 KiB. Currently I'm using __alloc_bootmem() for that, but maybe
kmalloc() becomes a suitable alternative now?
