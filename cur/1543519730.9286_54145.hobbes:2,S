Brian's post suggests a way to get a thread to run on another processor:
make it long-lived.  Try finding a spot in your architecture where
creating just *one* extra thread, hooked up to the rest of the code
by a queue, makes sense.  That will let you overlap that part of your
pipeline with the rest without adding too much overhead.  After a
while, it will naturally migrate to the other processor, if Brian
is right.
It's not clear there is always a sensible place to break things off
into a worker thread.  Carmack tried to find a way to speed up his 
rendering by adding one, I think, but gave up.  (Can't find it in 
his .plan; maybe it was May or June '99)
