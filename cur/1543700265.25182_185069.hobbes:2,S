More about UHCI && mousedev.
I have compiled 2.6.0 final release, and This compilation was using
EMBEDDED(to get tristate on mousedev) and mousedev as a module.
Without inserting module mousedev uhci-hcd hangs when I remove the
device.
So mousedev module probably is ok. 
If u have any code to solve it, and u need probe it email me and I'll
compile it and probe for u.
