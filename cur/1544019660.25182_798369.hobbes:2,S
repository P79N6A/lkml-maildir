The RT git tree is almost ready!  It is currently based off of 2.6.28,
until it becomes a little more stable. You can down load it now from the
git repo:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-2.6-rt.git
It boots on x86_64. A few more patches still need to be applied, but the
majority of them have been incorporated. Work on the non x86 archs also
needs to be done.
Once the git tree is pretty stable I will release a 2.6.28-rt1 patch,
make a v2.6.28-rt branch and then go right in sync with the mainline
tree.
Feel free to download it now and give it a try. And you can send me any
crashes that you see.
