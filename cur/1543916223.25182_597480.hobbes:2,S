Looks OK, although the comments are confusingly incorrect which
made it hard to see what this was doing:
 - There is no "nuke()" method in this driver, even comments
   don't use that term.
 - When "nuke" is used in the gadget stack, it means the way
   that controller drivers scrub out a queue of live requests
   queued to an endpoint ... *NOT* recycling memory that sits
   on a freelist, which is what's involved here.
 - Disconnect is *NOT* an error, it's a routine occurrence
   which can happen at essentially any time.
If you update the patch and comments accordingly, ACK.
