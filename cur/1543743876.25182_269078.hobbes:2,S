It has been suggested on lkml that CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION (aka GUID
Partition Tables, or GPT), be used as a partitioning strategy
(assuming you want partitions instead of whole-disk LVM) for >2TB
non-boot block devices, on all architectures, not just on ia64.
Granted, you've got to have a RAID controller to get there today, but
SANs can.
Also, Intel is heavily pushing for Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)
to be implemented in x86 and x86_64 environments in the next couple of
years, so it may become more widespread.

GPT = GUID Partition Table, that's the metadata as described in the
EFI Specification.  There's two copies, one at the front of the disk,
and one at the end of the disk, as a backup.  (why, I'm not too sure,
but that's the way it was specfied).  So the code needs to check both,
if it gets that far...

The check for invalid primary master boot record (PMBR) needs to be
moved up ahead of the reads for the GPTs (primary at the start of the
disk, alternate/backup at the end of the disk).  When first written,
Intel didn't specify that the PMBR (a normal DOS-like MBR partition
table with a single entry of type 0xEE covering the whole disk) *had*
to exist, so we let the code try looking for GPTs first.  When the
PMBR test was added, it should have been added ahead of the GPT tests,
not after.  I'll work up a patch to do just that, and will then remove
the dependency on IA64.  Fair enough?

Indeed.
Thanks,
