Matt,
The scan code does a 36 byte INQUIRY first and then does
a second INQUIRY if the response indicates more (than 36
bytes) is available. In this case _less_ than 36 bytes
was supplied. So either the scsi scan code or usb-storage **
needs to make some pro forma vendor, model and rev strings.
We found previously that doing a longer INQUIRY (254
or 255 bytes) locked up some [arguably broken] usb devices.
Hence we switched to the twin INQUIRY strategy. Evidentally
FreeBSD does the same thing.
Throwing away such broken devices is not an option I guess.
What does that device look like under Windows?
** Assuming the usb device in question is using usb-storage,
shouldn't it make sure at least 36 (valid) bytes of response
data is supplied by an INQUIRY? Andrew Morton had to do this
(perhaps at a lower level in the usb stack) to make some device
he had play with the scsi subsystem.
