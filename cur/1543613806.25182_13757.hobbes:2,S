I mean this:
root@diego:~# reiserfsck /dev/hdc5
<-------------reiserfsck, 2001------------->
reiserfsprogs 3.x.0j
Will read-only check consistency of the partition
Will put log info to 'stderr'
Do you want to run this program?[N/Yes] (note need to type Yes):Yes
Analyzing journal..nothing to replay (no transactions older than last
flushed one found)
Fetching on-disk bitmap..done
Checking S+tree../  1 (of   2)/  3 (of 110)/ 15 (of 149)node (10667) with
wrong level (18771) found in the tree (should be 1)
Segmentation fault

Well, I've a copy of all data in another partition...I'm running from it.
I've downloaded that version....well, it don't crash, here's output:
root@diego:~/reiserfsprogs-3.x.0k_pre11/fsck# ./reiserfsck -i /dev/hdc5
<-------------reiserfsck, 2001------------->
reiserfsprogs 3.x.0k_pre11
Will read-only check consistency of the filesystem on /dev/hdc5
Will put log info to 'stdout'
Do you want to run this program?[N/Yes] (note need to type Yes):Yes
