Gcc -dumpmachine  #should prints out i586-suse-linux for a P III here.
I'd try a fresh single processor machine and force a 2.6 kernel, module and
afs recompile for a i586.
SuSE 9.3 costs $90 and it solved a similar problem noted in the mailings. In
fact the YasT installed openafs binaries ran fine.
The ksymoops man page has a script to tail -f /var/log/messages|ksymoops1
explained.
Are you sure there isn't a memory problem? I'm running out of ideas.
