Ahh... It doesn't even get that far... It just dies with the
undefined symbols...

Steve,
A message saying (roughly) AIC7XXX 6.1.xxx appears while the kernel is 
loading.  You can also grep the aic7xxx.c source file or run the strings 
command ( strings /lib/modules/2.4.4/kernel/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx ).
I'm not sure about your undefined symbols problem, but I was able to build 
2.4.4 with 6.1.11 with no trouble.
