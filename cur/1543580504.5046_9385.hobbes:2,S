Probably I've missed this because the last time I hit such a thing was
when my ob800 bios mapped the cardbus memory BAR's into bogus legacy
0xe0000 area. Hence there was good reason to read and correct this before
trying to enable the device.
The normal case however would be like you've suggested, IMHO.
BTW, will it ever happen the kernel starts remapping BAR's when enabling
devices?
