Subject: [PATCH] 32-bit UID support for 2.3.33
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello. I have a new version of the 32-bit UID support patches for Linux
2.3.33.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991215/
Changes in this version:
	- updated to Linux 2.3.33
	- added new system calls for setuid(), setgid(), setfsuid(), and
	  setfsgid(), instead of re-using the old calls and hoping that
	  all old programs will set the upper 16 bits of their arguments
	  to 0
	  (same rationale behind adding a new shmget() on Alpha)
	- fixed bug in ext2 patch when 32-bit UID support is disabled
	  (thanks to Ted Ts'o)
	- fix ABI compatibility problem with SysVipc shm on Alpha
	  (pursuant to recent discussion)
It is tested and working on the i386 architecture.
A new glibc patch is forthcoming soon.
This version of the patch will also fix the problem with SysV shared
memory on the Alpha:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991215/linux-ipc.patch
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991215/linux-alpha.patch
The existing shmctl() and shmget() syscalls are now fully backwards
compatible; a new shmget() syscall has been added in the Alpha system call
table, and a new shminfo structure is available when using shmctl() with
the IPC_64 option.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
