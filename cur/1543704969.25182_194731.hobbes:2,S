check for negative value? That's odd. The pci_register_driver() in my
copy of 2.4.24 kernel (drivers/pci/pci.c) looks something like this:
{
	count = 0;
	for ....
		count += foo();
	return count;
}
Or will it change in the future? The patch that I sent was based on what
is in the current kernel.
Just for clarification:
I sent two patches yesterday (I should've numbered them, sorry I
forgot), since they address different issues and the driver registration
issue is being discussed right now.
First patch was cpqarray_eisa_detect_fix.patch, second was
cpqarray_pci_unregister.patch
