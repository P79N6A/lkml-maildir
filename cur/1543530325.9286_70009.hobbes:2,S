No, it's a risk with any system with finite memory.

Right... Shall we try that on the mail system here? (People telnet in to
read mail via Pine). 25 000 users, 4Gb RAM... Let's assume it has 21Gb of
swap, too. So users get a VM quota of an entire megabyte of RAM! That's...
Enough to log in with! (just).
Not really practical in a serious multi-user box. Fair enough if you have
a handful of users, I suppose - but we have Linux boxes here with several
hundred users. Restricting their memory usage to 1Mb each is hardly
practical - try compiling and running Java applets etc. in 1Mb??

On a small box, yes - provided NOTHING runs as root.

No, it's a risk with ANY OS which allocates memory. Even a single-tasking
OS with no concept of security, like Win2k^H^H^H^H^Hthe BBC Micro MOS, can
run out of memory - you just use it all.
IRL, there's not a lot you can do to prevent applications eating up all
your memory. You can reduce the risk in some ways, but there isn't a
perfect solution...
