I have been searching for a way to determine the memory cache hit ratio in
Linux and I came across a hitmiss patch for the 2.2 series that displays
some information in /proc/stat:
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=hitmiss
+patch&hl=en&rnum=1&selm=1998072200
4516.G574%40msu.edu
My question is, how difficult would it be for this patch to be modified for
the 2.4 kernel?  If it is not that difficult could some one point me in the
right direction in the code to modify the patch to work with 2.4.
Thanks for your help,
Andy.
