Yeah, I know, but ver_linux reports both for some reason.

And I *just* submitted a patch to actually report pcmciautils version. :)
If ver_linux was only reporting pcmcia-cs version, it probably should be
mentioned here.  Once we actually nuke it, we can certainly remove this
line and the related check in ver_linux.

I was particularly mystified by the C++ reference in ver_linux.  But apparently
somebody felt it was important enough to report, and I was basically just trying
to get the two things in sync.  Probably a good place for a 'N/A' or such.
