Got it. Sorry for the radio silence, I've been busy for a few days.
I discovered that either the i2c_core.ko or i2c_i801.ko modules cause the hang 
on resume! If you stop the entire i2c subsystem from being loaded by hotplug 
(note this is the BUS driver, not the sensors driver!), then resume works 
perfectly! Presumably there's a bug in the resuming of this module.
In other news, USB devices only work after I remove uhci_hcd and ehci_hcd and 
reload them.
The s3_bios workaround allows video to kind of work, but I can't use anything 
other than vga=normal (vesafb results in corruption), and the screen is no 
longer artificially resized to fill the LCD, it's native res and centered 
(which sure is annoying).
Kjartan, I hope you isolate the driver causing you problems, as it seems these 
machines can be made, even if it is a bit of a headache.
Lorenzo, thanks for your kernel config. It made it a lot easier to debug this 
problem.
