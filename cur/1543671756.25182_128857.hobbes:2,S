It could be useful for applications like streaming video where other
protocols on top provide additional functionality or in a multicast
session where TCP migth not be appropriate.

But should not the 2.4.X kernels have support for chained sk_buffs (like
the BSD mbufs) meaning that support for scatter-gatter I/O from the NIC
should be unneccessary to support zero-copy (i.e., NO in-memory data
copy operations)?
