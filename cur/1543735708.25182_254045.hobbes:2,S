Alex,
While I think that your patch is very important and should be included (maybe
if not as is if somebody has some objections but in some other form) I see it
more like developer's tool. I imagined status, HID, eject etc. attributes to
be sanitized interface to kernel's data, not necessarily causing re-evaluation.
So it could be like this:
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/status
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/removable
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/lockable
..
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/eject
And your raw access to the ACPI methods could reside under raw:
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/raw/_STA
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/raw/_RNV
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/raw/_LCK
..
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/raw/_EJ0
