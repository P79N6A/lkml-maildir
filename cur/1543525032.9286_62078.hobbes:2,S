Actually you can use locks that allow sleeping (semaphores, home built
locks using wait queues, reference counts etc.)

This is unnecessary, copy_to_user does this. It is also not 
enough, because it only checks whether user_buf is a user space address.
The real checking whether all parts of user_buf are mapped is done
during the copy itself via exception handlers (see Documentation/exception.txt)
Thus you need:

You should check the return value here (> 0 for -EFAULT, 0 for success)
