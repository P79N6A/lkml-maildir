Now, I was able to get an external modem. No workee...
The modem RD/TD LEDs are flashing, DTR is lit on permanently
so the modem is receiving and *tries to send*. Maybe the shop
went this far in testing to say that the cable works. :-(
But the PC isn't receiving. E.g. in WinXX, the modem is not found,
in RH9, no dialing out.
At least it is consistent with my findings with the null-link cable.
Back to the shop and sorry for the noise.
