Determining whether or not the system is working shouldn't be hit-or-miss.
To start out, try to determine whether each of the UHCI controllers really 
is mapped to IRQ 21.  Do this by booting with no USB devices plugged in, 
and then plugging a full- or low-speed device (like a USB mouse) into each 
of the ports in turn.  Check to make sure it works in each port and that 
that counts for IRQ 21 in /proc/interrupts increase each time.  To make 
this even more reliable you should run the test twice -- you don't have to 
reboot in between.  The first time, rmmod ehci-hcd before plugging in 
anything; the second time modprobe ehci-hcd before plugging.
The results you have reported make me a little suspicious.  The best way
to see whether the EHCI controller really is at fault is to plug in a
high-speed USB device.  I'm not totally familiar with the operation of
ehci-hcd, and it's quite possible that plugging in a low- or full-speed
device would not cause it to generate enough interrupts to be a problem --
even though you did trigger the fault by plugging in a low-speed mouse --
but plugging in a high-speed device ought to, provided ehci-hcd is loaded.  
Again, monitor the numbers in /proc/interrupts to see which is going up:  
IRQ 19 or IRQ 21.
The instability you mention is another cause for concern.  It may indicate 
that at some times, or under certain circumstances, the IRQs are routed 
wrongly whereas at others they are routed correctly.  And without any 
changes to the software!  If this is a random hardware fault it may be 
impossible to fix.  (But then why would it be so reliable under 2.4?)
Do you have a high-speed USB device?  Has it ever worked at high speed 
under 2.6?
