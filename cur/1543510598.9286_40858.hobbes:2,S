Don't forget the third option:
 'If I want to use the Bananavision capture card, I need to upgrade to
  kernel <foo>...  Oh, if I upgrade to kernel foo, I need to completely
  replace my network utilities, dhcpd, and my module utilities, plus I
  lose support for driver <K> which I need to run my <so-and-so>'
I've run into the third option;   I've got a Netgear GA620 ethernet
card, and was easier for me to convert the server to FreeBSD than it
was to migrate my system to a kernel level that would support the
GA620.
