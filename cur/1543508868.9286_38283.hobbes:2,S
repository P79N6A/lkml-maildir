The conventional wisdom is that one should read a list for about a month
before posting to it. The archives of this list may be found at:

I agree with you, however, the convention in the Linux world has been to
develop and test new drivers in the development kernel and then to
back-port them to the "stable" kernel. This has the advantage of having
the latest "stable" kernel run on the latest hardware. The disadvantages
are that the "stable" kernels are not as stable as they could be and that
a lot of development time (particularly of Linus and Alan) are spent on a
dead-end rather than on something that will have continuing benefit which,
of course, slows down the development cycle.
