I have been thinking about this for some days now and I have come to the
conclution that a shell-sort and binary search will be what I implement 
in my first patch. 
I have been thinking about adding a special case to 
detect an allready sorted array, it will cost N extra comparisions
for the non sorted cases. But It will give applications like SAMBA that
do switch between root and its groups and a user and its groups to use
an faster route by sending in the same array as was returned by
getgroups
when returning to the user or to root.
