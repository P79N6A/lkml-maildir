It doesn't make sense in general. Being derived from *BSD may mean
only a tiny fragment comes from *BSD. I can't see any valid reason
to force/ask the author to publish his/her code under BSD
(GPL + BSD = BSD) instead of GPLv2 as used by the whole Linux.
There are exceptions, of course - if you take a *BSD project and
include it with no/minor changes it makes sense to use BSD licence,
because we really want to cooperate, and because we don't have to
fear "evil corporations" taking our code (because it's mostly not
"ours").
