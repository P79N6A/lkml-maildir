I wasn't saying that 100 was a GOOD number, but that was just an
example. I'm one of those that don't like the program, application,
kernel, to limit you on how you want to shoot yourself in the foot. But
always have the default set to something that prevents the idiot from
doing something too idiotic.

Do you think 2/cpu is too high? I'd figure that reads usually happen way
more than writes, and writes can usually last longer than reads, but
having the default to two, you can test your code, on a UP.

Actually, I've had some success with NVIDIA on all my kernels (except of
course the realtime ones). Unfortunately, there are the little crashes
here and there, but those usually happen with screen savers so I don't
lose data. I just come back to the machine and say WTF, I'm at a login
prompt! I am one of those that save everything within seconds of
modifying, and use subversion commits like crazy :-)
