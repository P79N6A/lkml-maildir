You forgot the "journalist touch". To spike interest:
"PadLock ACE encrypts at rates of up to 12.5 Gigabits per second (Gbps) 
with a 1GHz VIA C3 processor, more than eight times faster than the best 
software AES implementation from a power hungry 3GHz Intel® Pentium® 4 
processor based system that encrypts at a rate of a mere 1.5 Gbps."
25 times faster, clock by clock :)
