James,
The current build system [such that it is:)] has some "make check____"
targets.
gccify.pl looks useful, but I generally trust my cooledit macros more
than a Perl script which it comes to automatically updating code -- at
least with cooledit the process is somewhat interactive, with erroneous
results or special cases immediately visible and obvious.
Would you consider creating a makefile target which simply lists files
in the source tree which need updating?  "make checkstruct" or
something?
Regards,
	Jeff
