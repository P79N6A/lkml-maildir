I raised a thread like this about 1 year ago. I was asking for it from
the point of view of a Telco. After some discussions on this list, I
came to agree with the posts on the list by other people that the
feature is not needed. At least certainly not needed in the Telco space.
99.999% uptime is much better acheived with the use of clustering,
rather than trying to upgrade software in a Live situation. In a
clustered environment, one offloads all the tasks from machine A and
spread them across the cluster. Once the machine A is not doing any work
at all, you can upgrade, reboot, whatever you like, and then add it back
to the cluster. This approach is much less risky than live module updates.
If the equipment is not clustered, it will at least be 2 to 1 redundent,
so you just upgrade the redundent device, manually force a fail over,
and then upgrade the other device. Again, no live update required.
I can only think of one other system that might benefit from live
updates, and that is set top boxes, so bugs can be fixed without the
user knowing. This also can be worked around by downloading the bug
fixes and only installing the bugs fixes when the user is not viewing
the TV. E.g. When the box has been placed in standby by the user.
