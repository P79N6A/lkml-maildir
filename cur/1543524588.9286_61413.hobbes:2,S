There are 2 different problems:
* callers of gfp()/kmalloc()/get_user() that call these functions with
!TASK_RUNNING, but which will set the state to TASK_RUNNING _without_
calling schedule() inbetween. For them, it doesn't really matter, we
don't need to change them.
E.g. sys_wait4(): it calls put_user(), then
set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING), then it returns without calling
schedule().
* callers that assume that TASK_{,UN}INTERRUPTIBLE remains effective
across these calls. We must fix them, and as far as I understood
Andrea's post, he agrees:

I found 2 places:
* __pollwait(). IMHO a real bug.
* write_chan() in drivers/char/n_tty.c. I'm not sure if this one is
critical.
