It is intended behaviour.  'irq=auto' in this case didn't help because
the ECP chipset would not tell us what IRQ it was assigned (it just
said "it's set by jumpers, or alternatively I'm not telling you".
The problem with just specifying 'irq=7' on its own is that in the
case of there being more than one port it isn't clear what it should
mean.
When there is only one port to consider, it would make sense to use
that IRQ, but by the time we know how many ports there are we've
already decided not to use the supplied parameter.  Patches
welcome. :-)
Tim.
