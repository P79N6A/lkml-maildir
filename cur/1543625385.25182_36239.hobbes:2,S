Worst case I agree is about is O(N), though you're forgetting the cost of
the global tlb_flush_all. Average case isn't by a long way, it's more like
O(1).
N = size of pool - number of permanent maps (makes the math readable)
F = cost of global tlbflush.
cost without flush = 1, which happens every time we do an alloc.
cost of flush = N + F (N to go through flush_all_pkmaps, zeroing)
=> average cost = 1/N + (N+F)/N = (1+F+N)/N = 1 + (1+F)/N
So the cost (on average) actually gets cheaper as the pool size increases.
Yes, I've simpilified things a little by ignoring the case of stepping over
the permanently allocated maps (this get less frequent as pool size is
increased, thus this actually helps), and by ignoring the cache effects
you mention, but I'm sure you see my point.
If you wanted to fix the worst case for latency issues, I would think it
would be possible to split the pool in half - we could still allocate out
of one half whilst we flush the other half (release the lock during a
half-flush, but mark in a current_half variable (protected by the lock) 
where newcomers should be currently allocating from). I haven't really
thought this last bit through, so it might be totally bogus.
But all this is moot, as what's killing me is really the global lock ;-)

Cool - thanks.

Writing that up now ...
