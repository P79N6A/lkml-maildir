Ok. So why don't you like RTLinux again?

So you  don't want to control tape drives, sample mics, and do other
audio that requires precise timing?

No networked audio systems? Plan ahead.

Streaming video. Or capture of high speed data acquisition.

Exactly. But you also want to rule out the working solution and want to 
believe that BEOS will be a working solution. In my humble opinion, BeOS
will fail to deliver in the long term precisely because its kernel 
design is more suited to 1980s Mac applications than to 2000+ mutlimedia
which will need to connect multimedia to big fast databases, complex
networks, and sophisticated i/o systems.
