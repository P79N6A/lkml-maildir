after compairing a working and not working client i found that
packets containing offset 19240, 20720, 22200 are missing
and the 100baseT client had an extra offset of 32560
on the working client it ends at 31080
the missing ones are mostly constantly missing 22200 appears every so often
on retransmission and 23680 also disappears every so often
i hope that isnt too confusing i dont use tcpdump type stuff much
(well i did give up on tcpdump and had to use ethereal...)
