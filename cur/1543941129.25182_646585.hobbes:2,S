A brick is usually something that is in the way -
Or you also say "the user has bricked his machine"
when it's quite unusable :)
Hope you did not mean /that/.

Needs a bigger data set to compare. But what is much more
important: does it use a single port for networing, or some
firewall-unfriendly-by-default multiple dynamic-port-allocation
like NFS?

What will happen when both nodes change an inode in disconnected state?
Which inode wins out?

btrfs is all we need :p
Where's the parallelism that is advertised by the "POH" in pohmelfs?
