As one of those who initially thought "great" about bugzilla for kernel
stuff, and then got rather annoyed with it, I think I can talk about
why bugzilla doesn't work for kernel developers.
* The most obvious problem is that it requires you to go to the website
  before you can do anything with a bug.
* Bug reporters appear to report a bug and run away - attempting to get
  more information from them sometimes resorts in silence until you
  threaten to close the bug, or do close the bug.
* Bug categories aren't explained well enough to allow users to determine
  the correct category.  Eg, PCMCIA network card - should that be
  networking or PCMCIA (where the bugzilla PCMCIA category is actually
  *only* the PCMCIA core and not any of the drivers.)
Overall, my experience with the kernel bugzilla has been rather
unproductive.  Most bugs which came in my direction weren't for things
I could resolve.
