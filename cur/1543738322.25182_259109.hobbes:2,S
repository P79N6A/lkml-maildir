I was hoping that I did misunderstand you ;-)

Do you mean non-exclusive or simply overlapping? If you think at the
implementation through sched_domains you really don't need a 1 to 1
mapping between them and cpusets. IMO one could map sched domains
structure from the toplevel cpuset down only as far as the
non-overlapping sets go. Below you just don't use sched domains any
more and leave it to the affinity masks. The logical setup would
anyhow have a first (uppermost) level soft-partitioning the machine,
overlaps don't make sense to me here. Then sched domains already buy
you something. If soft partition 1 allows overlap in the lower levels
(because we want to overcommit the machine here and fear the OpenMP
jobs which pin themselves blindly in their cpuset), just don't
continue mapping sched domains deeper. In soft-partition 2 you may not
allow overlapping subpartitions, so go ahead and map them to sched
domains. It doesn't really add complexity this way, just some IF
statement.
