Why not just have 2 threads, one for "sending" and one for  
"receiving".  When your receiving thread gets data it takes  
appropriate locks and processes it, then releases the locks and goes  
back to waiting for packets.  Your sending thread would take  
appropriate locks, generate data to send, release locks, and transmit  
packets.  You don't have to interrupt the receive thread to send  
packets, so where's the latency problem, exactly?
If I were writing that in userspace I would have:
(A) The pool of IO-generating threads (IE: What would ordinarily be  
userspace)
(B) One or a small number of data-reception threads.
(C) One or a small number of data-transmission threads.
When you get packets to process in your network-reception thread(s),  
you queue appropriate disk IOs and any appropriate responses with  
your transmission thread(s).  You can basically just sit in a loop on  
tcp_recvmsg=>demultiplex=>do-stuff.  When your IO-generators actually  
make stuff to send you queue such data for disk IO, then packetize it  
and hand it off to your data-transmission threads.
If you made all your sockets and inter-thread pipes nonblocking then  
in userspace you would just epoll_wait() on the sockets and pipes and  
be easily able to react to any IO from anywhere.
In kernel space there are similar nonblocking interfaces, although it  
would probably be easier just to use a couple threads.
