Hi,
I have released a new draft of the Linux 2.2 Press Release. It is available
from 
http://www.tip.net.au/~edlang/linux/
 .
I have changed the amount of quoting in it; the Microsoft bit is down to 1
paragraph. It also contains a URL to the Halloween documents.
The initial dot points have also been fixed.
Tabs spaces have been removed and replaced with spaces.
I am going to try esr and rms for some quotes.
