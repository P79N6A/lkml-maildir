I totally agree with this approach.  There are probably over 900 patches
that have been accepted into mainline as cleanups and bug fixes that
originated from Ingo's -rt patch set.  A lot of developers don't realize
how much the -rt patch has helped the mainline kernel.
But to keep the -rt patch maintainable, when a problem or cleanup is
discovered, we try very hard to get that fix into mainline.  That way we
don't still need to maintain it. Doesn't the Xen team do the same?
