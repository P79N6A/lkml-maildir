Ok, I got it to work -- thanks a lot.
Yes, acpi=off is mandatory. Unfortunately, thinkpad x60 does not boot
with acpi=off (should we add another test to linux firmware kit?
Machines should still boot in acpi=off mode...). acpi=off noapic
nolapic nosmp makes it boot, and that in turn makes kjump work.
Screen is not refreshed on kjump back to original kernel, but I guess
that's to be expected. I did not play with framebuffer, yet.
Maybe it is time to move kjump functionality into -mm and
kexec-testing?
