hi all
Is there something wrong with the -pre6 patch?
I'm trying to patch up the 2.5.4...
# tar xzf ../packed/k/linux-2.5.4.tar.gz
# cd linux-2.4.5
# zcat ../../packed/k/patch-2.5.4-pre6.gz | patch -p1
patching file CREDITS
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n]
and so on... patch -p1 -R gives me some hunks, but generally works ...
What's wrong????
thanks
roy
