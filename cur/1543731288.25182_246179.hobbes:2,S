Well, as far as THAT goes, I thought your tree-based
lookup was nice. I assume you still have the code.
What we got instead was a sort of cached directory
offset computation, which looks great... until you
hit the bad case. I suggest that the people trying to
reduce latency should try "top -d 0 -b >> /dev/null"
while running something like the SDET benchmark.
