I don't have any software answers, but it sounds like the modem is an 
external type connected by RS232 cable to a serial port.  RS-232 is 
pretty simple at the hardware level and you should be able to create 
a "Y" cable that "sniffs" the transmit from the computer to modem 
line without interrupting the dialogue between the serial port and 
modem. Just connect the transmit and signal ground lines to the 
receive and signal ground lines of a serial terminal or another 
computer with some terminal software (or even "cat </dev/serial1" or 
similar) listening to the serial port.  Back in Ye Olde Days (1980s) 
we used to diagnose modem problems like that all the time.
