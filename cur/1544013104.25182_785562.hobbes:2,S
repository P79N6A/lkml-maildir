Right.

Slub avoids hanlding memory policy decisions and lets the page allocator
deal with it. That means that memory policies are not enforced on an
object basis but on a page basis. If you allocate a series of objects
under MPOL_INTERLEAVE then SLAB will give you one object from each node.
SLUB will give you objects from one page until the objects in a page are
exhausted. The next page will be acquired according to the current
memory policy. Meaning the page will come from the next node if
MPOL_INTERLEAVE is set. The following set of objects will be allocated
from that node. This allows a faster allocation for NUMA since the cachelines
for allocation can be kept hot. The page are still allocated from all
nodes.
