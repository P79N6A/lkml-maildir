We're trying to clean all this crap up. I think we'd need a better
justification than 'I hate stdint' to use anything other than the
standard types which the language provides.
You'll get over it, I promise. I hated stdint too for a whole week or so
after I admitted it made sense to switch JFFS2 to it, because I actually
wanted it to be usable other than in the Linux kernel.

That makes sense.

That makes a certain amount of sense, although ppc64 currently lacks the
mess of platform-specific stuff that ppc32 has for various embedded
platforms. I suspect it would take a fair amount of work to produce a
single directory which everyone's happy with.
