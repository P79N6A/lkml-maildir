I can be really wrong on this because I didn't checked anything about
the GART yet but I suspect you cannot use the GART for this stuff on
ia32 in 2.4 because I think I recall it provides not an huge marging of
mapping entries that so would far too easily trigger the bugs in the
device drivers not checking for pci_map_* faliures also in a common
desktop/webserver/fileserver kind of usage of an high end machine.
