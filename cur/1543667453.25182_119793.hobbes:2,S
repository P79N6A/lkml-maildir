I've just got a new machine (2.5 GHz pentium lots of RAM and disk space) 
which has one of these SIS963 Southbridge creatures and I get the 
message on booting a 2.4.19ish sort of kernel.
Unknown bridge resource 0 - assuming transparent
Alas it's very clear that it isn't transparent and I can't get to half 
of the PCI stuff - worst of all the built-in Ethernet and any Ethernet 
card I plug in. It would seem that it isn't too transparent as the 
reported IRQ and IOMEM assignments for the devices are all scrambled.
I changed the message in drivers/pci/pci.c to report the base and limit 
values extracted and they are e000 and d000 respectively which explains 
why the code chokes on it.
I've followed a long thread about fixing this on transparent bridges - 
can some kind guru give me some runes to get this machine off the 
ground? A quick and dirty my-machine-only hack would be fine for me if 
not fully aesthetically pleasing to all and sundry.
I've looked at the SIS website and it wasn't a lot of help. They 
referred me to the motherboard mfr (ASUS). I emailed ASUS but still no joy.
I see the built-in Ethernet is an SIS900 no doubt that is more fun in 
store with that but I've got a small stack of alternative PCI cards on 
the windowsill which I'll stuff in if I can get past this problem.
