I can't really argue against this on any sane grounds - not only is it 
removing more lines than it adds, but moving from mostly unreadable 
assembly to C seems a good idea.
How does this impact the size of that code? Do we even care?
But as to how to integrate it, I'm not sure I really want to just merge 
it. I suspect we would want to have it in some public tree that people 
actually test at least to some degree first, and the -mm tree seems to 
make most sense.
I didn't see anything objectionable in the series, although I do think the 
explanations need to be re-done for a number of them. You seem to have 
violated the "a single line to explain the patch at the top" rule, and as 
a result they make no sense for some of them (the explanation for patch 
05/33 doesn't parse for me and 07/33 seems to have the single-line 
problem)
So let's just get this merged. But the question is, do we put it in 
2.6.23-rc1, or do we put it in -mm for a few weeks, which would imply 
waiting for the next merge window? Andrew?
