Hi Praveen-
We have a few LT6000r servers as well, and have the same problem on all 
2.4 kernels -- this happens when your MP spec is set to 1.1 in the BIOS. 
Change it to 1.4 and you should be okay.
The other common problem on these guys is the CPU speed misdetect, which 
causes the kernel to think your CPU is roughly 2x as fast as it really is. 
The solution to that one is to unplug and replug the power cords (even a 
power-off doesn't fix it, go figure).
Hope that helps.
-Matt
