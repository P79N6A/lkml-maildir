Hi all

Basically I think these changes are fine.  My only comment (which is
admittedly nit-picking) is that the "==="s under the title maybe should be
extended to match the new title's length. :)
> Why it is needed: 
>  The current driver/sound/sb_common.c also works for the ALS-100

The explicit detection of the ALS-100 was a pleasant side-effect of some
experiments I was doing with Mikael Pettersson back in April 1998 when the
first attempt at ALS007 detection code broke his ALS-100.  As a result of a
number of (register-level) tests Mikael ran for me, I came up with the
current code which is able to distinguish between the ALS007 and ALS100. 
The mention of the ALS100 at line 773 is only due to this.

A fair comment.  The document appears as written only because I had no
personal experience with the ALS100 and didn't know for certain that the
steps I did with my ALS007 worked with the ALS100 (or ALS200 for that
matter) as well.

It's good to know that it works on the ALS200 as well and I agree that it
should be documented.
> Further, I suggest:

Sounds consistant to me.
