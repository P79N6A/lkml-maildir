cachefs gets mentioned now and again, and is very useful.  We used it on
the cnn.com Web farm, where we had one big machine (NFS server) and
several Web servers all mounting the big server's drives with
nfs+cachefs.  cachefs really improved throughput, but cnn.com uses
almost exclusively static files.
With regards to implementation, I had a thought about that.
Have a simple VFS module which mounts the given block device, and registers 
a "cacheable disk area" with the kernel.  Maybe have mmap or ioctl hooks
for speedy access to userland.
knfsd, nfsd, or other networking modules can use this cacheable area as
they see fit...
