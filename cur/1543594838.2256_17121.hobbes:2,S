This happens for the CHILD socket, not the listening one.

Yes, and for listening sockets this is the callback made when a new
connection comes in.  See net/sunrpc/svcsock.c function
svc_tcp_listen_data_ready(), it's doing what you want to do.  Make
sure to check in a recent kernel because this used to make the same
mistake you are making, using state_change instead of data_ready on a
listening socket.
