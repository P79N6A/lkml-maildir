What "all the problems"? There was an issue with warnings on
struct-declared-in-parameter-list when CONFIG_PERFCTR is disabled,
but those are trivial to fix and a fix was posted early on.
Your patch is #ifdef:ing out calls that have explicit no-op stubs
for the !CONFIG_PERFCTR_VIRTUAL case. This shouldn't be needed.
(And you're testing the wrong config option.)
Also _please_ include the maintainer of said code if you think
it has problems.
