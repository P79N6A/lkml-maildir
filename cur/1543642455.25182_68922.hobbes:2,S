I don't think its chipset or memory, the machines that crash have different brand 
motherboards with different chipsets, I ran docmem for 24 hours on each stick of ram 
and found no errors. The ram worked fine in my WindowsXP machine, and it works fine 
when I use the non-smp kernel, and/or when I take the ram down to 2 sticks (512 
meg). I'm posting here because I believe I have narrowed it down to a bug in the 
kernel.
