ok, yeah, I thought you were talking about something else. Email
is a tricky medium at times.

Don't know. For non-DMA IDE access data copies are CPU driven
which can create tons of latency problems for that case. irq-threads
run as SCHED_FIFO and can freeze the system under heavy IO load
in that situation.
The way I interpreted the comment originally was irq-threads suck
which is why these latency happens. This is not what you ment. The
fear here is that there would be a push in the discussion to revert
some of this preemption work away from full preemption to more
conservative techniques like preemption points, which would drive
me absolutely bonkers right now.

I reread those comments.
I suggest that you read the patch for the answer to softirq
complexity. You'll find the implementation sane. It's a simple add-on
to how softirqs are handled currently with but pushed all ksoftirqd.
What was non-preemptible execution at the end of an IRQ handler in
the normal kernel is now pushed all to that thread. There's no mystery
magic here.

I interpreted the ksoftirqd comment/worry you said was just that,
inserting a concern about something you percieved as a possible
problem, therefore doubt.

This is a complicated problem and I'm not sure what folks are getting
at with the irq latency track other than it exists and it effects
overall latency in the system. Running above the priority of the
irq-thread handlers in a fully preemptible kernel should permit that
thread to run that task and service that thread at hand. Having the
ability to do that *could* help with overall system interactivity,
but it would require proper userspace apps to exploit it.

I thought you were doing some kind of scheduler CPU NUMA migration
stuff ?

Because it's a radical conceptual change to the kernel and this
development group has been classically resistent to these kind of
changes from what I've seen. There's also an insane amount of pressure
from commericial circle to blow this patch out of the water before
inclusion. Just because you haven't seen it yet doesn't mean it's not
going to happen. You can bet that RTOS folks are going to be all over
it in a negative way and they aren't as friendly as you.
Just about everybody in the RTOS works knows this is going to be an
atomic bomb to the industry for better or worse. This is excluding
the freakout nature of the SGI-ish stuff you'll be able to do with
this patch. Just wait until somebody gets a frame locked Doom3 out. :)

Sorry, yeah, I'm a bit jumpy from dealing with chronic irrationality
from the FreeBSD group, which has created low expectations from various
open source groups at times. Interaction with other jumpy kernel
conservatives in this community doesn't the help the matter.
Basically, the more you read 
http://linuxdevices.com
 the more you'll
understand why folks are edgy about this. :)
