Yes, the gcc error is very strange.  The underlying cause is that
(with CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n so __devinit is not just defined away to
nothing) having toshiba_ohci1394_dmi_table[] declared __devinit makes
gcc think it has to put the array in a section along with code.  But
instead of complaining about the array declaration, gcc complains
about some random function earlier in the file -- and which function
it picks to complain about seems to change depending on gcc version
and the phase of the moon.
