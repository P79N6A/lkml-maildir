This _is_ a hardware problem.

Wrong.
One cannot do statistics on one case. But you can on 10000+ of other
cases where the above just works (actually, even one case where it works
proves enough). You should give the mainboard a good massage to make it
behave more deterministically.
dust, dirt, aging, bad connectors, broken lines on the mainboard
incidentally making contact due to mechanical forces, thermal effects,
who knows what it is. It could be anything. It really is faulty hardware.
