      On the other hand,
    unchallenged false claims tend to become fact and society then accepts
    those "facts", just like Richard B. Johnson said.  RMS knows that and
    that is exactly what he is trying to do.  
Since we are in a minority, the advantage of shouting louder is not on
our side.  We can only convince people if we present a good argument
based on facts.
