At the moment, the s390 port is fully merged and functional (~30 known bugs,
more to be found) in the your tree, something that has never been the
case in 2.2 or 2.4.
I expect to see an official debian kernel for s390 2.6.early without any
architecture specific patches. The commercial distributions are likely
to remain some more time on 2.4.{19,21}, actually there are probably more
people still running 2.4.7 than 2.4.19 on s390...
