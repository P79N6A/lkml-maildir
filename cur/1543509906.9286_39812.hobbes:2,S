you know the drill, guys.  
http://people.redhat.com/zab/maestro
 has
version 0.06 of the driver that I expect to be far more solid than
previous generations.  many fixes.  among them:
 o diddle parallel out reg so that some 2es work again
 o not be brain dead about reading silly registers from the codecs.
   hopefully this will finally make the freaking evil 0x414b4d00 codec
   work for good.
 o fix wavecache access.  this falls into the "how in gods name did it
   ever work" variety.  we'll no longer walk all over memory while
   trying to record.
 o Eric Brombaugh has been kicking ass and taking names.  recording should
   be quite functional with his apu mode fixes, silly rate fix, and
   mono sanity.
so I hope this is actual useful for output and input.  we're limited to 1
/dev/dsp unfortunately, but that can be changed once we actually get the
hardware in a known happy state.
also, we're seeing some interesting board layouts out there.  I'm hoping
we can find out about them and index them via the pci subsystem id junk. 
So if you're going to send a report please include dmesg output after
driver insertion, 'lspci -v' output for the relevant devices,
and as complete a description of the hardware as humanly possible. 
the web page and small novel sized comment in the code have more details.
enjoy.
