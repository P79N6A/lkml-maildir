They are in fact the same, except for the packaging (well, one says "XP"
the other says "MP") and possibly some ID number inside.
The difference is that MPs are tested by AMD for SMP capability and
guaranteed to work (ie. if they don't work you can have it replaced).
As I detailed in another mail, XPs can basically be of three types:
1) failed MP test, sold as XP
2) not tested for MP since market demands more XPs
3) passed MP test, but market demands more XPs
XPs are cheaper than MPs so people try those in SMP configs in the hope
that there are many type 3 XPs or that they get type 2 XPs that would
have passed the MP test.
It's impossible to tell which type you actually got, so the XPs in SMP
are always one of the main suspects if there is a problem.  In short,
you won't have those (CPU specific) problems with MPs.  If it's other
problems (chipset, for example) they could still appear.
