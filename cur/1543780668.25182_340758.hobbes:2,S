Right, that is a valid concern. Avoiding context dependent symlinks
entirely certainly is one possible path around this. But, let's just for
the sake of this discussion continue the other path for a bit, to
explore the options available for implementing CPS which don't result in
shivers running down the spine, because I believe CPS do have some
applications in which bind mounts are not entirely adequate
replacements.
(Unless, of course, you want a bind mount for each homedirectory which
might include architecture-specific subdirectories or for every
host-specific configuration file.)
What would a syntax look like which in your opinion does not remove
totally valid symlink targets for magic mushroom bullshit? Prefix with
// (which, according to POSIX, allows for implementation-defined
behaviour)? Something else, not allowed in a regular pathname?
If we can't find an acceptable way of implementing them, maybe it's time
to grab some magic mushrooms and come up with a new approach, then ;-)
