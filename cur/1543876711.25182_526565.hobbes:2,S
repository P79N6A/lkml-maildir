It all depends on your use case :) But yes, we could introduce some
flags that selectively filter out some groups of uevents.

Currently, some drivers (like firmware_class) return an error code in
their uevent function in order to suppress uevents until they did some
setup. It seemed cleaner to use uevent_suppress and filter until they
were ready. For s390, we have the problem that we get a storm of
uevents for devices which aren't useable after all; we can use
uevent_suppress to make sure that userspace doesn't know anything about
those devices until we're really sure we want to keep them.
