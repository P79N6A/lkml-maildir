Hmm, interesting...  Are you doing this just to make it more
interesting, or did you never take Open Source 101? ;-)  Or economy,
game theory, ecology, politics, for that matter?
Do you realize how many contradictions arise from this claim?
A few examples for you.  Let me know if you don't understand why these
contradict this claim, I'll be happy to explain it to you.
How many newbies have patches accepted that they didn't test?
At which point in becoming a Linux developer does one leave behind
this altruistic attitude and becomes moved by self interest only?
How many people you know got to know Linux in their TiVos, took the
Linux sources that TiVo distributes and built it for their own PC?

Aah, ok.
So, you lowered the estimate for the case of a tivoized device, but
then claimed it was the same for an otherwise-identical non-tivoized
device.
Seriously, try 'modprobe logic', you'll like it ;-)

Then why do you keep making claims that are not related with either
the part of the argument I'm posing or the full argument I've already
presented?

The only proof you provided was that you didn't understand the
argument.

Which proves you don't understand how logical proofs work.
Let me explain it to you.
First, you need to establish initial premises.  Whether or not they
resemble any similarity with anything else you're thinking of is
irrelevant.  They might even be known to be false, in proof by
contradiction.
Then, you apply logical inference rules to the initial premises, and
establish consequences of the initial premises.
One of these consequences may be what you are trying to prove.  Or,
you may come to a contradiction, and prove that initial premises are
self-contradictory.  Or you may come to no useful conclusion
whatsoever.

Understandable.

I'll try to remember to do that.
