what i find most troublesome of this solution is that information
collected by ELSA is not reliable. The reason is that it uses netlink,
which is connectionless. So under heavy pressure, we can lose some
critical accounting data.
At least it would be nice if we can know when and why there are
problems of losing data with netlink. Any solution?
