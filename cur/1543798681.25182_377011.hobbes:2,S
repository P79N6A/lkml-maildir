The problem is the free swap space is not constant as long as you are
trying to free more RAM, because some pages can get swapped out in the
process at any time.
To handle this properly we would have to count the amount of free swap in
every iteration of the loop in swsusp_shrink_memory(), but I wouldn't like
to make this function swap-dependent.
We are going to move the image-writing and reading functionality of swsusp
to the user space anyway and the userspace process controlling the suspend
will solve this problem.  For now, please use workarounds like the Stefan's
one.
Greetings,
Rafael
