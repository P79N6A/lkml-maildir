Dear Lennart,

I am having the partition table on the cam formatted CARD 
i.e. the partition 0.

Ok, I understood it. It looks like we have to verify the partition
support we have implemented in the driver.

To handle it in a similarly in Linux we need to support this driver with
partitions. There looks a loop hole in the driver. 
I will verify and fix it today.

Just out of inquisitive ness.
What r u the minor numbers of those zip devices.
ll /dev/zip 
ll /dev/zip4
Thanks for ur support.
I will check with partition support in the driver & update it.
Let me fix it there and come back.
