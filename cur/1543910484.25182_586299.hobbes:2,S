Even better.

Better still.

Ok. I've been a developement manager, so I'll expect it Thursday.

I prefer "simple" over "trivial", but yes, you have the nut of it.

Well, that's what the exercise is out to demonstrate. I admit to

I can understand your postion on the SELinux policy.

Sadly true.

Now you see, I don't agree with that. It's simpler than an SELinux
policy. It's not simpler than a Bell & LaPadula (once we were able
to get past the initial resistance to MAC and get someone a three
day training class they were able to do some cool things) and it's
certainly not simpler than Smack.

If only security professionals can use the system you have failed
to provide a general purpose facility. It may have value in limited
circumstances but it is not for everybody.

It is my position that the SELinux reference policy fails the
"small enough to analyze" clause of the TCB principle.
As a result SELinux does not help me feel secure. Restating
the complexity of the applications in the policy is arguably an
improvement, but I can't help but think the effort would be better
put into fixing the applications.
So long as your definition of "secure" allows for something other
than "runs SELinux", and so long as you are willing to accept the
conclusions of "security professionals", I can point to several
examples of systems that have been evaluated using other mechanisms.
There aren't other mechanisms upstream in Linux yet.
