If you compulsively add braces where not needed, the number of lines in 
the source file explodes.  Net result is code that is more difficult to 
read, because far fewer lines of code fit on a single page/screen.
But hey, it's personal preference.  I'm not going to enforce the 
make-code-more-readable rule on others' code... :)
