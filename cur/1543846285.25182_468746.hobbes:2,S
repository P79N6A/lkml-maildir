	There is no way old tools are going to set/process those extra
flags, so it does not work. And this won't fix out-of-tree drivers...

	Let's not throw the baby with the bathwater.
	This is *not* the first time I've done such incompatible
change in WE (size in set, pointer in scan, remove pointer in
events). The other time, it went completely under the radar, you guys
did not noticed anything (apart Jouni).
	The difference is that this time I attempted to do it a bit
quicker than usual. Maybe I was too fast this time. But I've noticed
that some distro have become slower to pick up changes than in the
past, which is frustrating me.
	To me, the solution is just to let a bit more time for the
userspace to propagate to the distro. And to educate users to pay
attention to the incompatibility warnings displayed by the tools.
