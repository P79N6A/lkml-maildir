OK, I've thought about this more.  I can appreciate the argument that
writing directly to disk avoids the performance impact of having a
user-space daemon write to disk (e.g., scheduling and, possibly, extra
copies).  However, I do not believe this addresses the fundamental
problem and, because of the nature of the problem, I do not believe the
performance improvement will be observed in all cases.  Let me explain.
CPUs can generate audit records magnitudes of order faster than they can
be written to disk.  Further, the production is non-uniform.  Because
this problem involves a bursty producer and a slow consumer, I view it
as a queuing problem.  Writing directly to disk makes the consumer
marginally faster, but it does not change the fundamental relationships
in the problem -- the consumer is still magnitudes of order slower than
the producer.  This means that, even though the direct-write consumer is
faster, the speed of the whole queue hasn't changed much, if at all.
Further, I am concerned that using direct writes instead of netlink
moves hard problems from one (simple, flexibly) layer to another (more
complex, less flexible) layer.  For example, the file system may have
already made some decisions for you that you could have made differently
if you had access to information about the netlink-managed queue.
