James:
what is the current state of PM in fb drivers?
does modedb is being used on 2.6 drivers?
Is there an API (or lib) to use framebuffers devices without
worring about differents visuals?, to quering, setting or
disabling EDID support? will these drivers export sysfs

thanks for your work on fb.
