If you want to squeak every last ounce of performance out of the filesystem,
just have it declare two filesystem types - one for the little-endian, and
one for the bit endian.  Generate one of them via "sed" from the other, to
rename the functions, exports, etc, so they don't conflict.  Then, depending
on the superblock magic it will mount the right filesystem, depending on
endianness.  Since they are separate filesystems, normally only one module
or the other need to be loaded at a time, and there is no runtime overhead.
Cheers, Andreas
