As long as that is true, I agree that the fact that so many autotool 
packages don't work well is irrelevant.
However, I think the difficulty of using autotools (I mean using by 
packagers), as evidenced by all the people who get it wrong, justifies 
people being skeptical that util-linux really has that expertise 
available.  Also, many open source projects are developed by a large 
diverse group of people, so even if there exist people who can do the 
autotools right, it doesn't mean they'll be done right.
One reason I try to minimize the number of tools/skills used in 
maintaining packages I distribute is to enable a larger group of people to 
help me maintain them.
