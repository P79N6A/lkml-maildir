Definitely library, I'd think.

OK, my alpha is a sick bunny at the moment, so I'll have to wait until I get
home (so I can see why I can't ssh to it).  What the wrapper does is set some
settings so your program gets sigbus when it generates an unaligned trap, and
then runs your program in gdb so gdb helpfully stops at the line which
generated the trap.  It goes without saying you need to build the program in
question with debugging symbols so that you see the code.
You then need to fix the unaligned access.  This sometimes requires real alpha
guruhood (Which I do not possess, but Richard Henderson or Michal Jagerman do,
if you need advice), but sometimes simply requires adding __attribute__
((__unaligned__)) to a struct member in a c file.
