Dear All,
	I want to get memory usage of myself and my child process. I try
to use getrusage but the memory field in rusage struct is always 0. I
check getrusage function in kernel/sys.c. I found that there is no memory
usage information so the memory usage by getrusage is always 0. Do I
understand correct? And is there any other function to do this?
Thanks,
Theewara
