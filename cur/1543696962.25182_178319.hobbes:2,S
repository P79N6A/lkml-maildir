Excellent point. We're actually much better off resetting it at signal
return.
Which should make all other resets unnecessary.
Yes, you can get out of a signal by using longjmp, but that doesn't
matter: you can't longjump to a restart call (well, you can, but only if
the user literally tries to do the restart by hand, ie he _intended_ to do
it).
So the _proper_ fix (for x86) should be as appended. Agreed?
