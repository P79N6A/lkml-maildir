Sorry about that previous (incomplete) message.
If I mount a castlewood EIDE *removable* disk in Redhat's 2.2.5-22
kernel, then I'm stuck "forever" with the inode vector for that disk,
even if I unmount it, eject it, and replace it with other media, even
media *without* partition tables.  In fact, the disk can be mounted
(read-only) and recursively "du"'d without it even spinning up (after
a weekend of being unmounted).  If I then "cat" a file, then the disk
spins up, and I get garbage.
It seems to me that either the inodes aren't being deleted on the
unmount, or maybe the disk drive itself is caching the information
(and not letting go).
I did various web and dejanews searches, and no-one's reported this
problem as far as I can tell.  Does anyone know anything about this
problem, or am I on my own, needing to solve it myself?

PS.  This summer, Castlewood (www.castlewood.com) started producing
removable 2 gig disk drives.  The drives are $200 (scsi, ide, etc) and
the media are $30 each.  Under scsi, the drives are pretty peppy,
especially for 5400rpm.  I have an external scsi drive and an internal
ide drive.  The ide drive could read a disk written by the scsi drive,
though with the above "locked in" problem.
