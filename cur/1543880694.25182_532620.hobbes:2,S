I use scx200_i2c.  The SBC I am using doesn't work with the scx200_acb
(different pins on the cpu after all).  I would love to see it
reimplemented using the generic interface, since there isn't that many
lines of code involved as far as I can tell.  Well scx200_acb works fine
on a Geode LX board, but not on a Geode SC1200 board.  Unless it has
been fixed since 2.6.18, then it still doesn't work, but scx200_i2c
works perfectly fine.
