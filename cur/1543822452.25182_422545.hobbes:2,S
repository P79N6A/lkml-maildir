I've switch from sk98lin to skge this morning using 2.6.17-rc3-git17
since the sk98lin driver simply drops my connection after a little while
and also has a lot of problem enbling the connection with my linksys
(although it`s linux also).  
Suprisingly my PC frozed about an hour after the driver switch?  Maybie
it is not a problem with the real-time patch of Ingo since I'm not using
it?
