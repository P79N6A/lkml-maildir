If we look at arch/x86/Kconfig we see:
### Arch settings
config X86
        def_bool y
        select HAVE_AOUT if X86_32
        select HAVE_UNSTABLE_SCHED_CLOCK
        select HAVE_IDE
        select HAVE_OPROFILE
        select HAVE_IOREMAP_PROT
        select HAVE_KPROBES
        select ARCH_WANT_OPTIONAL_GPIOLIB
	...
So the normal syntax here is "HAVE_XXX_XXX" - not ARCH_HAS_XXX_XXX
If you update your patch please use this syntax,
and locate the select under X86 - not under the 32/64 entries.
But I do not see why adding these in the first place.
See following advice from Linus:

I really think that whoever started that 'HAVE_ARCH_x'/'ARCH_HAS_x' mess 
with totally random symbols that have NOTHING WHAT-SO-EVER to do with the 
actual symbols in question (so they do _not_ show up in grep'ing for some 
use) should be shot. 
We should never _ever_ use that model. And we use it way too much.
We should generally strive for the simpler and much more obvious
	/* Generic definition */
	#ifndef symbol
	int symbol(..)
	...
	#endif
and then architecture code can do
	#define symbol(x) ...
or if they want to do a function, and you _really_ don't like the '__weak' 
part (or you want to make it an inline function and don't want the clash 
with the real declaration), then you can just do
	static inline int symbol(x)
	{
		...
	}
	#define symbol symbol
and again it all works fine WITHOUT having to introduce some idiotic new 
and unrelated element called ARCH_HAS_SYMBOL.
