This is due to a bug that's already been identified in v4l's input
support, caused by recent changes in the kernel's own input layer. A
patch has been proposed at the v4l list but it hasn't been tested yet. 
A good way to skip this for now is to add "options saa7134 disable_ir=1"
to you modprobe.conf.
Be aware that v4l @ rc1 has other problems related to kernel VMA changes
that render video-buf unusable, and have been fixed after the release of
rc1. You may want to try the latest -mm.
