Well, there is no restriction on putting files on the routing engine's
storage devices (flash and hard drive); it is running OpenSSH, so
scp/sftp work fine, and you can drop to a shell easily.  The restriction
is that the kernel won't run unsigned binaries.
Also, flipping physical switches is pretty much an unreasonable
expectation for core router operation.  These are often in other
locations, sometimes other telcos' central offices (where you have to
pay to have "remote hands" do something and then hope they don't screw
it up).  You can easily go the entire life of a device where the primary
operators never physically see the device.
