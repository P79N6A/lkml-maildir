I haven't received any contributions to unifdef in the last 18 months
which is why it hasn't changed. Yes, it has some significant gaps in its
functionality, but it's reasonably correct within its current scope. (I
tend to think that if you need more advanced functionality then you are
already in serious trouble: for example, my unifdef was written so that I
could understand xterm's frightening pty handling....) I don't have a lot
of time to make extensive changes to unifdef, and given that sunifdef
exists there is not much point. Thanks for telling me about it: I didn't
know it existed, and it's nice to see other people basing such great stuff
on my work.

I don't think your syntax errors are my problem :-)
Tony.
