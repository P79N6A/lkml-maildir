A new approch (not obvious like the previous one) that results in way
better iteractive performances and doesn't hurt much the elevator
capability is here:

It can be applyed cleanly on the top of 2.2.14. It is going to make a big
difference only in IDE and other subsystems that left all the requests
into the ll_rw_block layer even during I/O. For SCSI it helps but not so
much as for the other lazy drivers ;).
