First, what's wrong with the GUID partition table format?  Let's stick
to standards as long as they work; especially for things that
potentially affect multiple operating systems.
Second, several problems with this.  Sector 0 is the boot sector, so
using it is a really bad choice.  (I'd reserve several sector for
master boot code.)  In fact, rather than having a separate partition,
why don't we just specify that a sector starting with "# Plaintext partition
table" has to start within the first 64 sectors of the disk (it's
common for DOS partition tables to have the first partition start at
offset 63.)
Third, it ought to be possible to put more information than this,
e.g. for raid detect.
