I do not want to give up on this idea, either... if the implementation
needs to be "hackish" or even explicitly ignore certain functions, so be
it.  There is a _lot_ that can be done with detailed call chain analysis
-- the point you gave is one of many.
Checker already has some basic functionality here I suspect based on
what it is capable of reporting... imagine what more could be reported?
