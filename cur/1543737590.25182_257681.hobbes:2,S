Subject: [PATCH] Backport Via IRQ mask fix

Hi Marcelo:
Here is a backport of the Via APIC IRQ mask fix that Al Viro made to 2.6.
This is his original description:
# ChangeSet
#   2004/06/23 10:55:18-07:00 viro@parcelfarce.linux.theplanet.co.uk 
#   [PATCH] bug in V-link handling (arch/i386/pci/irq.c)
#   
#   	Via southbridges use register 0x3c of the on-board devices (USB and
#   AC97) to control interrupt routing for those.  In drivers/pci/quirks.c we
#   set it correctly (dev->irq & 15).  However, in pirq_enable_irq() where the
#   second half of that stuff lives, we forget to apply the mask.
#   
#   	That's what causes problems with ioapic on via motherboards in 2.6.
#   One-liner below ACKed by Alan, verified on via-based boxen here, obviously
#   doesn't affect non-via ones (we only set interrupt_line_quirk for via
#   chipsets). 
Cheers,
