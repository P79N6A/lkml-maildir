Not necessarily.  The smallest instructions tend to be more complicated
and expand to more basic operations, so decoding cost _may_ be reduced,
but the next step in translation, and the area used in the cache, and
the execution time, may be longer.

That's one of the wonders of dynamic profiling.  (Which, btw, you can
do at a bounded arbitrarily low cost if you're prepared to forget about
caches ;-)  You decide when to inline based on whether its worth it in
each situation.
