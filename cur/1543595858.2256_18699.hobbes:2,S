The driver checks against PCI bus+dev+func in 2 situations:
1) To apply the boot order that user can set up in the controller NVRAMs.
2) To detect buggy double reporting of the same device by the kernel PCI
   code (this made lot of troubles at some time).
The great bug is to invent useless abstractions that don't match reality.
Such brain masturbation leads to confusion (hence subtle bugs)  and
useless software bloatage (thus _real_ resource wastage).
If we want to handle _real_ PCI bus domains, we just have to add a domain
number to identify a _real_ PCI device. Anything that wants to hide such
reality in some opaque data looks like brain masturbation to me.
