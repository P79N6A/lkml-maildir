If a -nice _tree_ is useful, your guys just have to launch it. Gosh this could reduce
arguments about what goes into the kernel and save Linus and Andrew lots of work.

Busy enough with testing, actually far too busy for being on a volunteer basis ;)
I am sure that better qualified and properly supported/sponsored individuals
will queue up as long as it is an _official_ -nice tree with the good purpose
of centralizing useful non-core functions :)

Pretty does not count above, Ugly does not count here, Functionality always does.
Besides that patch might be in the -nice tree.

Kernel knows when in interrupt context and can defer switching.

Which is extremely ideal, but one thing at the time...
