Yeah, its an awkward situation, and we refuse new rt tasks in such
groups. But the 0 value is needed so you can have groups that don't
participate in the realtime scheduling because we enforce a
schedulalbility constraint over the groups.
Each group has a runtime ratio, namely: rt_runtime / rt_period.
The sum of this ratio over all groups must be smaller or equal to the
global ratio which must be smaller or equal to 1.

Yes, I looked at that, I found the interface somewhat unfortunate, it
would mean growing the struct with two more function pointers. Perhaps a
read and write function with abstract data would be better suited. That
would allow for this and more. Sadly it looses type information.
