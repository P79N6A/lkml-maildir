Ok, this is getting really humorous and I've no way to explain it.
Every few kernels I install on my laptop, when doing an APM resume, the
floppy activity LED comes on and stays on until I do something to change
the status of the floppy such as attempting a mount (with or without a
floppy in the drive).  Simply inserting a floppy or eject/insert doesn't
fix it.
Being on a laptop, this can be a significant power drain when I'm
running off the battery.  It's an NEC Versa LX, the floppy is the
standard 1.44 that comes with it.
Any takers?
