I think it is bad advice, because a lot of problems only happen in SMP
mode or under high load that may need two cpus. The best advice is IMHO
to put a serial console onto it and log oopses from another computer.
In case of deadlocks the NMI oopser in 2.4 should solve that problem,
for 2.2 it may be useful to give a pointer to it.
