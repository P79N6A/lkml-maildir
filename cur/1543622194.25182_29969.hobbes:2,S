i tried setting the NETIF_F_SG flag, but the stack still gives the right checksum. 
Now, i have this 1 more question. If @ all the stack does offload chksum to the hardware, how will the driver come to know about this? Is there a per packet indication from the stack asking the driver TO-DO/OR-NOT-TO-DO chksum offloading?
thanx again
HV

I haven't looked at this in a long time, but at the time the checksum
offloading support was introduced, the IP stack needed both NETIF_F_SG
and NETIF_F_IP_CSUM in dev->features before it would start offloading.
The idea was that cksum support without scatter-gather support is useless,
because the csum gets calculated essentially for free while copying the data
to linearize the skbuf.
