hi list!
i have a problem with ip routing!
first of all my configuration:
Tux1 .... embedded linux (kernel-2.4.10) running busybox-0.60.3
          and 2 lan interfaces in different networks
          default gateway 10.1.0.254 via eth0
R1, R2 .. router (linux for testing)
Tux2 .... linux with network different to Tux1/eth0/eth1
     eth0=10.1.0.1/16 +-----+ eth1=10.2.0.1/16
                   .--|Tux1 |--.
                   |  +-----+  |
eth1=10.1.0.254/16 |           | eth1=10.2.0.254/16
                +-----+     +-----+
   ip_forward=1 | R1  |     | R2  | ip_forward=1
                +-----+     +-----+
eth0=10.3.1.254/16 |           | eth0=10.3.2.254/16
                   |           |
                   '-----+-----'
                         | eth0=10.3.0.1/16
                      +-----+
                      |Tux2 |
                      +-----+
i want to achieve, that each packet received on Tux1/eth1 will also be
replied via this interface. this isn't the case now, because the
received packets came from a different network and therefore the replies
are sent back via Tux1/eth0 using the default route.
but the replies have to be sent even when the connection between
Tux1/et0 and R1 is not available. a possible solution is, setting a
network route for network Tux2/eth0 via Tux1/eth1, but in my special
case, i do not know from which network i'll receive the packets!
and here i reached the point where my knowledge ends;-(
i tried to solve this problem in my application running on Tux1, using
the following code:
s = socket();
bind(s, "10.2.0.1"); // bind to Tux1/eth1
listen(s);
s2 = accept(s);
int yes=1;
setsockopt(s2, SOL_SOCKET, SO_DONTROUTE, &yes, sizeof(yes));
...but setting SO_DONTROUTE on socket s2 doesn't have the effect, that
the reply packets are always sent back via Tux1/eth1! 
is it possible at all to guarantee this in any case? because this means
bypassing the routing stuff!
any hints welcome!
greetings, 
rainer
