I'm still waking up, but '..' obviously breaks the "no cycle"
observations.
It's just that '..' is well known name by utilities as opposed
to arbitrary links. Symlinks as poor man's link can create unwanted
cycles (but are caught again by utils?)
I was always wondering what to do with all those spare CPU cycles,
running around in circles in the file system will soak them up. :-)
