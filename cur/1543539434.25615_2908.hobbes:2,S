Hi, I've got a va linux box running debian+2.4.0test3 and an Adaptec 4port
starfire board.  Whenever I ifup any of the interfaces it has constant
kernel message errors to the effect of "Internal fault: The skbuff
addresses do not match in netdev_rx: " then several numbers, some in hex,
some do not appear to be in hex.  This appears to be one of the
debugging tests in starfire.c.  Can anyone give me a pointer?
	Thanks
		Nick
