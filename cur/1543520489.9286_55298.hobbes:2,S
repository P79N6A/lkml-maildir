Hi Gurus,
    This time I am with a small and silly question,because  I am
confused by listening to too many answers.
What is the difference between Task and Process ?
Are they the same or
Is it only naming convention of Linux/Unix and Win
or Is it having a major difference ( Please clarify ).
Thanks in anticipation,
- GAURAV
