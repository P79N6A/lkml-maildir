Err. I meant NULL pointer dereference.

As I recall the patch series started with modifying attach_pid
to take a struct pid pointer instead of a pid_t value.  It means
fewer hash table looks ups and it should help in implementing the pid
namespace.
Well the initial kernel process does not have a struct pid so when
it's children start doing:
	attach_pid(p, PIDTYPE_PGID, task_group(p));
	attach_pid(p, PIDTYPE_SID, task_session(p));
We will get an oops.
So a dummy unhashed struct pid was added for the idle threads.
Allowing several special cases in the code to be removed.
With that chance the previous special case to force the idle thread
init session 1 pgrp 1 no longer works because attach_pid no longer
looks at the pid value but instead at the struct pid pointers.
So we had to add the __set_special_pids() to continue to keep init
in session 1 pgrp 1.  Since /sbin/init calls setsid() that our setting
the sid and the pgrp may not be strictly necessary.  Still is better
to not take any chances.
Anyway the point of removing the likely(pid) check was that it didn't
look necessary any longer. But as you have correctly pointed putting
it on the task list and incrementing the process count for the idle
threads is probably still a problem.  So while we are much better we
still have some use for the if (likely(p->pid)) special case.
Is that enough to bring you up to speed?
