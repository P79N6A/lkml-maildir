Ok this box is an enterprise server (web server for the arts faculty
here for one purpose) and as such, should remain up 24/7.  the longest
uptime I've had since I started working here is around 27 days with
2.2.9
We have had somre real disk failures but if all of the errors I see were
real, we would be up to 5 disk failures since the start of the year.  
the problem with using older kernels is bugs.  I believe before 2.2.8
there as a bug in the cache handling routine which resulted in the
creation of zombie process locking up devices.
anyway.  as a last straw, I may revert to an old 2.1 kernel I have I
know had uptime of a little over a month.  hopefully a new set of segate
9 gig UW's may fix any problems.  an interesting experiment yes??
Cheers
Craig
