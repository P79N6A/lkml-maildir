Hmmm, I understand how 7N1 looks the same as 8P0 on the wire, but
surely the remote machine should never get to see that, and the local
shell works fine.
 --------         ----------            --------------
|Terminal|==7N1==|My machine|--TCP/IP--|Remote machine|
 --------         ----------            --------------
If I send an A, although my terminal is sending:
..111111111111101000001111111...
               ^       ^
             Start    Stop
my machine will just send a 65 over the TCP/IP connection.
