I agree 100% - it would be nice to be correct instead of "usually
works".
Once you're talking about nanoseconds, you can have both: each time
you store an mtime, make sure the value is at least 1 nanosecond
greater than the previously stored mtime for any file in the
serialisation domain.  If it is not, simply _wait_ for up to a
nanosecond until the value has advanced enough.
