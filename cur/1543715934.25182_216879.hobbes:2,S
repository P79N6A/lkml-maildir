Subject: [BUG] 2.6.6-rc3: make xxx_defconfig randomly sets options

Hi,
If I have an ARM defconfig file which contains:
# CONFIG_SERIO is not set
with none of the other CONFIG_SERIO symbols, and I run make foo_defconfig,
I get the following in the resulting .config:
CONFIG_SERIO=y
CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=y
CONFIG_SERIO_SERPORT=y
This is despite not being an X86 architecture, and isn't affected by
whether CONFIG_EMBEDDED is set or not.
If I run "make oldconfig" after switching CONFIG_SERIO off and removing
the other CONFIG_SERIO_* symbols, I get:
Serial i/o support (SERIO) [Y/?] y
i8042 PC Keyboard controller (SERIO_I8042) [Y/n/m/?] (NEW)
It appears SERIO is forced on because SERIO_I8042 _may_ be wanted by
the user, which in turn forces SERIO_I8042 to Y in the defconfig case
because we don't accept input from the user and the default is Y.
So, there is _no_ way to presently have a working defconfig file for
a machine which does not support I8042 - I8042 will always be
_unconditionally_ selected no matter what.
Can we please take Aunt Tillie out to the firing squad?  This hacking
around with the Kconfig files to make X86 life simple is causing _real_
bugs for other architectures.
