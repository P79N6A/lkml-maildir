You used to use BitKeeper, right?
Well, git works just fine for creating and maintaining separate repos, 
where each repo is its own branch.  Dependent branches are handled 
simply by pulling new changes from the parent (drm-initmap) repo into 
the child (drm-savage) repo.
If you just have a few branches, such as your example above, rather than 
the 50+ branches I have, then I would recommend _ignoring_ the advice in 
my git howto, and instead create a new branch by cloning:
	cd /repos
	mkdir drm-via
	cp -a linux-2.6/.git drm-via
	rm -rf drm-via/.git/objects
	cp -al linux-2.6/.git/objects drm-via/.git
Once created by the above recipes, or similar, the directory will 
function as a repo just like with BK.  When you wish to update it from 
upstream, update your local linux-2.6 repo and then
	cd /repos/drm-via
	git-pull-script /repos/linux-2.6/.git
or to pull new changes from initmap into savage:
	cd /repos/drm-initmap
	# { check in some changes }
	cd /repos/drm-savage
	git-pull-script /repos/drm-initmap/.git
Does all that make sense?  It's really quite similar to BK, if you 
ignore the "[jg-specific]" portions of the git howto I wrote.
