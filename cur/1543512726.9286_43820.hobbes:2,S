Now after all that worrying and quick patching, I discovered that the
'32 bit base' bug is non-existant and non-relevant as long as it is
compiled with binutils 2.9.1.0.7 or above. 
I had known this all along (the horrible compatability problems with early
binutils) but all the reports so far had (mistakenly) said that they had
used a recent binutils, leading me to believe it truly was just an
overlooked problem.
All the '32 bit' errors caused so far have been due to older versions of
binutils which don't do the right things (in more than one instance).
<wipes cold sweat from brow>
I guess I was trying to stay a bit *too* on top of this -- being
responsible for breaking the compile singlehandedly and all :)
Anyway, here's the latest attempt at all fixes. Please try with binutils
2.9.1.0.7 and up (and with the new 2.9.5's too; I'm curious as to what
they have to say).
There is something to be said in breaking from 2.9.1 binutils altogether,
and going for 2.9.5.0.xx -- I've seen a tremendous improvement in the code
gen (esp 16 bit), and seems to be a bit better versed in error reporting.
There are a few codegen bugs in 2.9.1 that I had to explicitly code around
(in video.S), that I'd love to get rid of.
I'd recommend adding something to Changes that moves the minimum to 2.9.5,
but I'm not at all sure what the latest 2.9.5 is, nor which is considered
most stable/bugfree.
