My point was the server thread in the above scenario is
non-preemptable.  Otherwise upon B soliciting service from
S, A's work by S would be preempted and attention would be
given immediately to B.
This may very well be a concession to simplicity in the
design.  The server context on behalf of client A would need
to be saved [somewhere] when B caused the preemption and
restored when A's priority deemed doing so.
For a mutex, the priority promotion of 'anything of lower
priority in my way' to logical completion is needed to
preserve the semantics of a mutex, ie: mutex ownership cannot
be preempted.  However in general this doesn't hold for the
server thread model.  We could redirect the server
immediately to a different client at the cost of additional
context switching -- a compromise to consider.
Again this is the general case.  It is likely for critical
sections to exist in the server thread where preemption must
be disabled analogous to the kernel/cpu preemption model.

The dependency chain does exist here as for mutexes if we
allow servers to wait on other servers.  Note in this usage
a preemptive server model favors preemption over priority
propagation unless the target server is itself blocked.
Note here it is more obvious [at least to me] circular
dependencies are to be disallowed.  With mutexes, especially
of the reader/writer variety, circular ownership
dependencies can go unnoticed which will confound the
priority promotion logic.
