Wow! 
Now one can:
	- implement different framebuffer drivers for a chip. 
	- try a stable and development version without rebooting,
	- have probing with user interaction ("if you see me please 
	  press enter else I will try the previous driver in 15 seconds.") 
	  instead of deciding on "failsafe" (vga/vesa) and "fast" 
	  (special driver) at boot.
I love it!
Just the take_over_console() as alternative API looks strange. 
It's ok as an intermeditate step (likely, if I remember the discussions
correctly). If it should stay, it should require the console to 
be registered first. 
Can be changed later, once as you make progress and don't reach a release
kernel. This is NO show stopper for me.
Progress is the most important thing for development in this areas 
until it reaches a release kernel.
