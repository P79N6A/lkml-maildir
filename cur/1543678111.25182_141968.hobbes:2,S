Hi all!
I'm booting up with a initrd in a romfs. After loading all needed
modules and pivoting root I unmount the initrd and flush the used
buffers.
Since I updated to 2.4.21 I can't unmount the initrd - it says it's
busy, but it's no (or at least lsof does say so).
I use kernel 2.4.21 with /drivers/Makefile , /drivers/ide and
/include/linux/ide.h from ac1 to reenable ide-modules.
Anyone know the problem?
Tobias
