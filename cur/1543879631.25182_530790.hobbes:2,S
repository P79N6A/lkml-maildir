Currently im using Linus's current git + your extra patches + CFS for a while. 
Kaffeine constantly freezes (and uses %80+ CPU time) [1] if i seek 
forward/backward while its playing a video with some workload (checking out 
SVN repositories, compiling something). Stopping other process didn't help 
kaffeine so it stays freezed stated until i kill it.
I'm not sure whether its a xine-lib or kaffeine bug (cause mplayer didn't have 
that problem) but i can't reproduce this with mainline or mainline + sd-0.39.
