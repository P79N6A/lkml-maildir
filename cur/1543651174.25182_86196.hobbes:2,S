Exactly. On Debian the qt2 devel stuff is 17MB (!). Yesterday I was trying
to compile 2.5.45 just to see that even doing make menuconfig (which I
always use) breaks because of missing qt. It turned out that the problem is
in the scripts/kconfig/Makefile which executes the $(obj)/.tmp_qtcheck no
matter which configuration interface is used [1]. Adding '-' in front of the
rule served as a temporary work-around, but I got a bit shocked on finding
out that I'd have to dload 17MB of the Qt devel packages.

Neither, but since it's here, it better work on any box :)
