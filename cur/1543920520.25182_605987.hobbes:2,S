I wouldn't read too much into these data sheets.  Note that actual OHCI
1.1 features are nowhere documented in these data sheets; i.e. this
documentation can't be trusted to begin with.
As far as VT6306 is concerned, the wording could be copy'n'waste from
the VT6307 datasheet.  And in case of VT6307, I suspect it's VIA who
selects the implementation level (based on chip revision), not the card
vendor.
