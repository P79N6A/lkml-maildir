Hi,
I have just tried upgrading my firewall to 2.6.12, but neither of the following rules in my
FORWARD table was allowing return traffic:
 1109  814K ACCEPT     all  --  ppp0   br0     anywhere             anywhere         ctstate
RELATED,ESTABLISHED
  11M   13G ACCEPT     all  --  ppp0   br0     anywhere             anywhere         state
RELATED,ESTABLISHED
I have currently returned to using 2.6.11.11, where the identical configuration works fine. br0 is
a bridge device containing two e100 devices, and ppp0 is my PPPoE DSL link. I am using iptables
1.3.1.
Cheers,
Chris
