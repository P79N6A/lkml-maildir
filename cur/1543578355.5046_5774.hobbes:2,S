Hi there.
I rewrote my previous bugreport.pl in bash. I would appreciate it if you
had a look on this one. Run it once and give me feedback if you like.
If the formatting is overloaded please let me know.
If this one is ok, I will probably add the possibility to check
the version recommendations in Documentation/Changes (Keith posted it).
To Ulrich: I think I have the library checking part ok now (libg++ will
also be checked via ldconfig in the next version).
