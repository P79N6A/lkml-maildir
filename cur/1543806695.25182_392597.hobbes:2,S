	That's just not true. There is no reason under copyright law why the author
of a program could not modify its license. However, the GPL explicitly
prohibits *anyone* from modifying it.
	The reason you can't modify the GPL, even we assume the GPL is licensed
under the GPL, is because the GPL says you can't modify the GPL.

	It is logically impossible for the GPL to be GPL-incompatible. To be
GPL-incomptabile, a license would have to contain requirements or
restrictions not found in the GPL. How could the GPL possibly do that?
