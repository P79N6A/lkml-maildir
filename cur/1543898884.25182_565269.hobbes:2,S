Ah, ok. Sort of like the Aussies among whom I'm living say "Mate", I guess - 
in that regard at least.

Mmm. I can do it in a vm; that will make it less painful.

Ah. I'd forgotten about the existence of the -mm list. I'll take a look when I 
get some time to do more of this.

I think I could get away with just doing the logical online part. It's mainly 
the adding pages to zones that I'm interested in - I'd have to trigger the 
expansion (and shrinking) of already allocated bitmaps.
Thanks very much for your help so far!
