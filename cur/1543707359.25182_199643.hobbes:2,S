Hi,
Not a show stopper problem, but its annoying.
I'm using kernel 2.60 with framebuffer support for i810. All is working
well except when I shutdown from while in iceWM. If I issue a shutdown
from xterm, then X stops and the console displays normally i.e. the text
that was there before X started, but it doesn't refresh and show the
shutdown sequence, instead the screen remains static. If I log into a
console on tty(x) and then shutdown, the shutdown sequence is shown.
Hope I explained this ok.
Any Ideas?
