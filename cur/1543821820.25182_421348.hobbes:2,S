He does every couple months and leaves it open for a few weeks.
Then, just to keep us guessing, he releases it with a 2.6 name ;-)
Actually, I think the system is working quite well.  We've got a quick
route for getting bug fixes and security fixes to users, and a shorter
devel cycle helping distro folks get more regular drops from upstream.
This particular patch applies all the way back to the beginning of git
time (over a year ago), and I'm sure earlier.  So it's hard to conclude
it's a byproduct of the release cycles.
thanks,
