Oh, here is the patch I sent Linus and forgot to CC
everyone else.

Allow __follow_page to succeed when encountering a clean, writeable
pte. Requires reintroduction of the direct page dirtying. Means
get_user_pages doesn't have to drop the page_table_lock and enter
the page fault handler for every clean, writeable pte it encounters
(when being called for write).
