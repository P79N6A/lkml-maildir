  Jesse> David, please apply this set of patches from Pat.
Unfortunately, the 2.6 tree is closed for cleanups.  I would _like_ to
see the patch applied, though.  Perhaps you could talk to Andrew and
see if you can get an exception?
  Jesse> Btw, any estimate as to when your BK tree will be updated?
Just did a short while ago.  It's not the final stuff, but getting closer.
(I just merged your discontig fixes, btw.)
