This may be well a hardware problem. Same laptop (HP nx7300 GB848ES)
works fine with either 2.6.22 and 2.6.23-rc. Maybe actually using the
DVD is required to trigger the problem on the next reboot?
Sergey, btw, on this laptop I've observed lockups twice with the -rc5.
After switching to 2.6.22 it was stable for at least one day. Can you
confirm or refute this?
