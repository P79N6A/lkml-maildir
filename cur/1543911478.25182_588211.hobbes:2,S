Hi Rusty,
Please tell me if I'm wrong, but I think it would not be a problem:
- seq_read() makes sure that a buffer large enough is available so that
  m_show() can fully extract and print the information relative to 1
  module.
- m_start() and m_stop() takes the module_mutex, therefore within one
  seq_read(), once m_start has returned, the struct module * that we
  have is valid and will be consistent during the whole seq_read
  operation.
- If a module is removed, and then a different one is inserted at the
  same address, while we are between two seq_reads for this given struct
  module address, the seq_reads will copy to user-space the information
  that is still in the buffer for the _first_ struct module encountered,
  not the new one.
- After that, iteration will continue to the new struct module address,
  effectively skipping the newly inserted module.

Small test module for this:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#define BUFSIZE 1024
int main()
{
	int fd = open("/proc/modules", O_RDONLY);
	char buf[BUFSIZE];
	ssize_t size;
	do {
		size = read(fd, buf, 1);
		printf("%c", buf[0]);
		usleep(100000);
	} while(size > 0);
	close(fd);
	return 0;
}
(compiled as ./module)
Actual test (kernel 2.6.23-rc3):
dijkstra:~# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
pl2303                 18564  0 
usbserial              29032  1 pl2303
ppdev                   7844  0 
sky2                   37476  0 
skge                   36368  0 
rtc                    10104  0 
snd_hda_intel         265628  0 
  (here, while we are printing the 2nd line, I rmmod pl2303)
compudj@dijkstra:~/test$ ./module
pl2303 18564 0 - Live 0xf886e000
usbserial 29032 1 pl2303, Live 0xf8865000
sky2 37476 0 - Live 0xf884f000
skge 36368 0 - Live 0xf8838000
rtc 10104 0 - Live 0xf8825000
We see the the 2nd line is garbage.
Now, with my patch applied:
  (here, while we are printing the rtc module, I rmmod rtc)
nd_hda_intel 268708 0 - Live 0xf8820000
ltt_control 2372 0 - Live 0xf8866000
rtc 10392 0 - Live 0xf886d000
skge 36768 0 - Live 0xf8871000
ltt_statedump 8516 0 - Live 0xf887b000
We see that since the rtc line was already in the buffer, it has been
printed completely.
  (here, while we are printing the skge module, I rmmod rtc)
snd_hda_intel 268708 0 - Live 0xf8820000
ltt_control 2372 0 - Live 0xf8866000
rtc 10392 0 - Live 0xf886d000
skge 36768 0 - Live 0xf8871000
ltt_statedump 8516 0 - Live 0xf887b000
sky2 38420 0 - Live 0xf88cd000
We see that the iteration continued at the same position even though the
rtc module, located in earlier addresses, was removed.
Note that this test is done with the 
"Sort modules list - use ppos instead of m->private"
patch applied.
Thanks for the review,
Mathieu
