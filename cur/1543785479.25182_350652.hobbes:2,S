I'd propose that these:
s390-default-configuration.patch
s390-bl_dev-array-size.patch
s390-crypto-driver-patch-take-2.patch
s390-show_cpuinfo-fix.patch
s390-diag-0x308-reipl.patch
are 2.6.14 material whereas these:
s390-3270-fullscreen-view.patch
s390-ipl-device.patch
aren't (at least, yet).  I've asked Greg to take a look at the sysfs stuff
in the last two patches.
OK?
