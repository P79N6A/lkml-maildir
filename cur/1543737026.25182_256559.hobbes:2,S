Hi,
Anyone noticed that pmdisk software suspend stopped working in -rc3 ?
In -rc2 it worked just fine. My script was
  chvt 1
  echo -n shutdown >/sys/power/disk
  echo -n disk >/sys/power/state
  chvt 7
In -rc3 it appears to write pages out to disk, but never shuts down the
machine. Is there something else i need to do or am missing ?
Thanks
M
