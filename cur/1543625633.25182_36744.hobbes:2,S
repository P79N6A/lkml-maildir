Hello,
	Here are some patches to correct the MCA setup for different Pentium cores 
in bluesmoke.c.  The P6 family must not initialize MSR_IA32_MC0_CTL in 
software, it must be done by the bios.  The P4/Xeon cores must have this 
bank initialized in software.  Added check for processor type and 
associated init loops.  Included patches against 2.5.7 and 2.4.18.
Cheers,
Jon Hourd
