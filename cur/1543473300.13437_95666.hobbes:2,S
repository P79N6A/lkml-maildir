Naaah, you're right - 2.1.x/2.2.0 is not as fast as 2.0.36 is reliable.
Give me a reason why people should switch to 2.2 if tcp-nfs+locking is
missing and some other features don't work as they do in the docs?
Most people want linux because it's _good_ in stability, 
functionality and design. The chain is as strong as its weakest link.
I did not have a single crash/malfunction w/2.0.36 in accumulated
>600 days of uptime, some machines heavily loaded. I can't claim this
for other OS'es, and I won't change it.
