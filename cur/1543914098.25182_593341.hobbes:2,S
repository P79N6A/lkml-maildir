I absolutely agree with your slab reclaim patchset.  No argument here.
What I'm starting to wonder about is where your approach has advantages
over Andrea's.  The chances of triggering something vaguely similar to
Nick's worst case scenario are certainly higher for your solution.  So
unless there are other upsides it is just the second-best solution.
