Again - the ISDN version in Linux-2.3.4 was updated and I'm having
problems.
The file linux/Documentation/isdn/README is not uptodate. It points me
to ftp.franken.de which was not updated since December. I got isdn4k-utils
of a newer version which I got from ftp.suse.com (isdn4k-utils-9905121100)
and that version is still wrong. So, I reboot an older kernel, and get 
3.3 megabytes of isdn4k-utils-9906081100... Looks like it's going to take
an hour or more to download in the current speed (some slow connection
along the path). Previous experience tells me that the development versions
of isdndn4k-utils never compile cleanly, that's going to be another
hour of hacking before I can use it.
Simply stating what's the right version of isdndn4k-utils to use with a
certain kernel could save users a lot of grief.
Thanks,
Itai
