I needed the patch below to get it working at all. sym_get_choice_value() 
might return a NULL pointer. The choice value is only updated if the 
choice symbol is yes and even then it can be NULL, if no choice value is 
visible.
I couldn't select 'Adaptec AIC7xxx support'. Choice symbols are special 
tristate symbols, beside having the tristate value it also points to a 
choice value.
The autoexpand mode is very annoying, even after changing a single symbol 
everything is expanded again. Keyboard support is basically nonexistent.
Anyway, it looks interesting, but still needs quite some work. :)
bye, Roman
