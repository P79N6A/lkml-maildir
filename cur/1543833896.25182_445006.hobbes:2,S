That's where he started talking about how BSD gets namei() right by
allowing each file system to deal with it how it chooses.
Personally, I think it's insane. On occasion, I've started to port
ReiserFS to BSD-like systems, and I get so fed up with how you have to
reinvent the wheel for everything. There's something to be said for
replaceable-anything semantics, but personally I like the Linux model
and having an agreed-upon framework to work with.
I also think it's insane to come up with a reisermetafs to export procfs
information when a simple s#/#!# _on a single directory name_ will do
the job.
