  That's what I did.  Replacing scsi_release_buffers() calls with calls 
to scsi_free_sgtable().  The only logic removed is bounce-buffer 
release/copy-back.

  AFAIK, those are done by blk_rq_map_user() and blk_rq_unmap_user(), 
both of which are invoked directly by sg_io().

  That code is invoked only for REQ_BLOCK_PC requests without bio, and I 
digged pretty hard but, in those cases, AFAICT, the callers are 
responsible for supplying dma-able buffers and nothing seems to alter 
cmd->buffer after the cmd gets initialized, but I might be missing 
things here.  If so, please point out.
  Thanks.
