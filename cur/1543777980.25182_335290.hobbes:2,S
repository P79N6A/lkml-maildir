Neil,
   Thanks.~10-12GB of total RAM (16GB) are
   How can Proc virtual memory parameters like inactive_clean_percent, 
overcommit_memory, overcommit_ratio and page_cache help me to solve / 
reduce Out Of Memory conditions on servers with 16GB RAM and lots of GB 
swap?
   Kernel does not free cached memory (~10-12GB of total RAM - 16GB). Is 
there some way to force the kernel to free cached memory?
/proc/meminfo:
              total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:    16603488256 16523333632 80154624        0 70651904 13194563584
Swap:   17174257664 11771904 17162485760
MemTotal:     16214344 kB
MemFree:         78276 kB
Buffers:         68996 kB
Cached:       12874808 kB
Thanks to all.
Marcio.
