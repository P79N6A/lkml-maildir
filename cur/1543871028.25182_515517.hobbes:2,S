In which case communications over that port could be unreliable.
What if the kernel decides to spit out a message in the middle of
your applications data transfer?
If you're using a serial port for a data application, don't make it
the kernel console.

No idea, sorry.  It's not something any Linux kernel version has ever
supported, and since I no longer do serial support it's not something
I'd be involved with anymore.
All I will say is that thinking about keying such a decision off the
kernel console= parameter is absolutely silly - the console= parameter
has nothing to do with the serial port's userspace settings.
