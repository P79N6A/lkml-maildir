I've got a ByteCC external enclosure too, and I can't get it to work
reliably under Linux or Windows under Firewire.  I'd return it and get
something better.
Also, the 2.6 ieee1394 sbp2 driver isn't the best at detecting these
things.  And if it does, it doesn't always work well with drives in
there as well.  I've been having tons of problems and I basically gave
up.
