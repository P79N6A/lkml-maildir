Note (I am repeated myself from an email I just sent) that the
conditional schedule won't show better results if
current->need_reschedule is unset, since preemption won't be enabled.  I
need to add explicit support to the preemption-test patch for this.
So you may see some better results, but just one time the condition
schedule does not occur, you will see the worst result in
/proc/latencytimes -- remembers its the 20 worst (perhaps we need
average or total latency, too?)
Now, with all that said, you should _see_ an improvement with this
patch.  You say short hiccups.  Some? All? How much better is it?
