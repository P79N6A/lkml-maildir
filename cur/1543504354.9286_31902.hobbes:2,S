You may elect to use a quite unfair coin if you want, the decision will 
be also quite good. ;-)
The endian mode defines how the CPU adresses partial accesses to a machine 
WORD. For well designed and well written applications that may share data 
representations using a given mode, the endian mode is a no-issue.
What is inferior is for a CPU to have to deal with data using the opposite 
endian mode or having been designed to be optimal for the opposite mode.
And even if one endian mode had some advantage in theory, it would be so
minor, that the 50-50 pro-con ratio would exist forever in my opinion.

The domination of PCI and Intel platforms should be considered for the
choice here.
Explicit shortcuts along the code are ugly and some minimal abstraction
should be used for them. "#define" and "inline" are your friends for them
to possibly be redefined, without any impact for the mode that may take
advantage of the data representation, and make code cleaner and more 
understandable.
