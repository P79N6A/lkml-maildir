Jan replied later on this issue that he is not able to reproduce this problem
any more. Looking at the above, I could see a potential problem where
menu governor may get confused by the C-state residency time from poll
idle or C1 idle, where this timing info is not accurate. This inaccuracy is
due to interrupts being handled before we account for C-state exit.
Patch below fixes this and is needed regardless of the issue pointed out by
Jan Willies here. But, I am suspecting that the patch will also fix the
problem reported by Jan.
Do not mark TIME_VALID for CO poll state.
Mark C1 time as valid only with mwait (CSTATE_FFH) entry method.
This makes governors use the timing information only when it is correct and
eliminates any wrong policy decisions that may result from invalid timing
information.
