No.  POSIX aio does not have any concept of a completion queue.  Completion 
in POSIX aio comes via a thread callback, signal delivery or polling, all 
of which are horrendously inefficient.

Maybe.  The unfortunate aspect to this is that you can't tell if a number 
matches the name you expect it to be, and invariably people end up running 
the wrong code on the wrong kernel.  Or vendors start shipping patches to 
enable these new syscalls....

I'm working on something.  Stay tuned.
