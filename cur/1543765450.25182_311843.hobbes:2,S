Thanks for the response.
I think I misspoke a bit in my email above. The intent was not to
eliminate all might_sleep() calls from the copy_from_user() code path;
but rather juggle the source around a bit so there is only one
might_sleep() call per each code path. Currently, in the default case,
it calls it twice.
By the way, is the following still true about might_sleep()?
