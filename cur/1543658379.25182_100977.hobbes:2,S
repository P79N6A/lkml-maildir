Actually, it already exists - It's called "lost+found".

You also have to figure out how to communicate with an absent
user for cron/batch/background operation. After all, the user that requested
the deletion may be logged out, even if the system has only one user.
It also won't help the current situation (there is  "rm -i ..." after all).

already named "lost+found".
