This is plausible (and I did indeed consider the file variant),
though it may require more infrastructure than for tmpfs only.
It may be worth clarifying that I have no concrete plans to work on
the JIT emulator issues myself. I'm only disseminating ideas I think
will pass review. I expect others to take up the issue(s) perhaps with
some inspiration from what I described. I may review some, but I have
a large review backlog as things now stand.
