There's probably enough here to shim in a regular slab and kmalloc
interface layer to run a desktop machine.

I think a layered approach to handling NUMA and the like makes an
awful lot of sense here. And probably greatly simplifies locking, etc.
Also, I like that you've gone to off-slab accounting. Not only does
this simplify things overall, it's good for memory footprint and
possibly better on cache footprint.
It's gonna need a better name though..
