Subject: perhaps an oddity in 2.4.1?

straight 2.4.1.  accidentally did:
	mount /dev/blah /mnt;
ok., looks like what i need.
	mount /dev/blah /opt/src;
ok., seems mounted.
er...  just realized i forgot to umount /mnt the first time.
i don't remember multiple mounts as a declared feature in 
2.4.1 [wouldn't be the first time i forgot].  might even
be handy.  is there any doc to describe multiple mounts
or is this accidental?
thanx.
