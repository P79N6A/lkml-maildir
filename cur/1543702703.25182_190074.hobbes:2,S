With the various fixes people had been posting USB storage
writing was still hanging repeatedly when doing a 20Gb rsync
to usb-storage disks with a low memory system. Doing things
like while(true) sync() made it hang even more often.
After a bit of digging the following seems to fix it
Not sure if 2.6 needs this as well.
The failure path seems to be
	->scsi_done in the USB storage thread
	issues a new command
	causes USB to kmalloc GFP_KERNEL
	causes a page out
	queues a page out to the USB storage thread
	Deadlock.
Setting PF_MEMALLOC should stop the storage thread ever causing pageout
itself so deadlocking.
