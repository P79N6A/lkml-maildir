That's going to make me just as unhappy, especially since it's pointless;
instead of the entire sorry mess we should just bump sb->s_active to pin
the superblock down (we know that it's active at that point, so it's just
an atomic_inc(); no games with locking, etc., are needed) and call
deactivate_super() on the way out.  And deactivate_super() is exported
already.
