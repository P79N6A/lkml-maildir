PS:  Just to clarify, I'm not speaking for the volatile modifier.  I'm
not speaking for any particular implementation of atomic_t and its
accessors at all.  All I am saying is that
  - we use atomically accessed data types because we concurrently but
    locklessly access this data,
  - hence a read access to this data that could be optimized away
    makes *no sense at all*.
The only sensible read accessor to an atomic datatype is a read accessor
that will not be optimized away.
So, the architecture guys can implement atomic_read however they want
--- as long as it cannot be optimized away.*
PPS:  If somebody has code where he can afford to let the compiler
coalesce atomic_read with a previous access to the same data, i.e.
doesn't need and doesn't want all guarantees that the atomic_read API
makes (or IMO should make), then he can replace the atomic_read by a
local temporary variable.
*) Exceptions:
	if (known_to_be_false)
		read_access(a);
and the like.
