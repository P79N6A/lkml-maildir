I am trying to load an ELF file onto a coprocessor.
Please don't kill me - This forum seemed the the closest to what I am
looking for.
I read the TIS manual, and I can analyze an ELF file, but I got some
questions relating to how you load and finally link the ELF in the physical
address space.
Anybody here I can ask?
Thanks (if you don't kill me that is)  :-)
