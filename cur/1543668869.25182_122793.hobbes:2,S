2 seconds sound like "spanning-tree portfast" in Cisco-speak. 20
seconds sounds like normal configuration. Both are legal and work with
normal FE gear. It might be possible that you must deactivate
spanning-tree if you don't connect a switch.
I personally found the 20 second break always annoying so I routinely
disable it on my catalysts. :-)
