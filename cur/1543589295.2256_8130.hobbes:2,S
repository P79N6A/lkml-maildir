David,
Would it be acceptable to have csum_block_* in the architecture
specific code?
Firstly, architecture specific code can optimise them more
efficiently, and secondly it will prevent checksum rotations in
the architecture specific code which will only get undone by
the csum_block_* code.
Or am I missing something?
