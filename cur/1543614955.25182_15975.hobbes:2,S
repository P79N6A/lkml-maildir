OK, I have a slightly modified version of the patch that I created just
before starting my Christmas break.  The only problem is that it crashes
the kernel hard when I remove the apm module.  I have not had a chance
to get back to it since then, but I am back at work in Wednesday and
it has my highest priority at the moment.
Question:  Has anyone got any empirical evidence that this patch
improves the idling behaviour?  i.e. does it consume less power or
lower the temperature?  I intend to try to measure this on Wednesday,
but a wider set of data is always better.
Thanks again for putting these patches together.
