Subject: [2.6.12.2] unexpected block device behaviour ...

Hi Folks! Andrew!
accidentially stumbled over the following issue:
creating a filesystem (in userspace) requires a period
of quiescence after that (about 5 seconds) until you
can reliably mount the new filesystem ...
this can be observed on 2.6.11 as well as 2.6.12.2
(didn't test older kernels yet) on x86_64 (SMP) with
loopback or dm (lvm2) based block devices (probably
also with other block devices) for different file-
systems (ext2,ext3,xfs,jfs,reiserfs) ...
Rik and I agreed that it is at least unexpected
behaviour, especially as doing an fsync() on the
block device doesn't remedy the deficiency.
so the sequence to 'trigger' this basically is:
  mkfs.* $DEV
  mount $DEV $MNT
and the mount fails sometimes with:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/*,
       missing codepage or other error
(but works quite fine if you wait 10 seconds)
here are some scripts (and example output) I used 
for testing this ...
