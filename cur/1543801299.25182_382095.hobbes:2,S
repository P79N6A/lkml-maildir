The DMI scan looks like it's done in try_init_smbios().  But
try_init_acpi() is done first.  Since every ia64 machine has
ACPI, I would think try_init_acpi() should be sufficient.
Or do you have a machine that doesn't supply the SPMI
table used by try_init_acpi()?
Personally, I think try_init_acpi() should be re-done so it uses
the normal acpi_bus_register_driver() mechanism, which would
locate the IPMI device in the ACPI namespace.  I don't think
there's any need to rely on the SPMI, which is primarily there
to support OS's that want to do IPMI stuff early in boot, before
the ACPI machinery is ready.
