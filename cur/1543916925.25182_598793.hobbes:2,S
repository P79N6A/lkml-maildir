We've both done the same job, so it's unsurprising that we share the
same view on this.  A number of times I've had out of tree module
authors complaining to _me_ because "Fedora fucked up my module, it
works fine in $otherdistro"  (ignoring the fact that $otherdistro
is a point release or more behind Fedora).
There's definitly a culture-gap between some out-of-tree module
authors and people who intend from day 1 to get their code merged
into mainline.  The former don't know what happens in mainline
until several distros start moving onto newer kernels, so no amount
of warnings is going to help these people.
