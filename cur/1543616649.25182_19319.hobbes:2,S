I don't think its a big problem. A page gets you 256 locks or whatever the
number ends up as. For the case where you have many fine grained locks
between a group of threads thats great. You just parcel them out. If its
two processes just wanting a lock between them, well they get a page with
room for 256 lock objects, but they only want one. That doesn't matter. 
Its one page, if they need two or two hundred locks its stil one page.
