I recently built the new release. Sadly, this particular change
results in my machine performing a hard reset during boot :(
Thus far, I've confirmed that changing the HZ value back to 1000
resolves the issue and I'm now up and running. So it's not the end of
the world but I would like to know which area of the kernel is falling
foul of this change. I'm concerned that others might be affected. I'll
see if I can establish a clearer picture of what seems to be going
wrong here.
Maybe it would be a good idea to allow the user to change this if
needs be? The patch below allows for this (assuming gmail does not
mangle it), provided that experimental config options are enabled and
only on the x86, ppc64 and x86_64 architectures.
