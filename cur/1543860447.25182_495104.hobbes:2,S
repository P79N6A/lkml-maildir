i did notice that.  while the majority of the architectures simply
define clear_page() as a macro calling memset(ptr, 0, PAGE_SIZE), the
rest will implement it in assembler code for whatever reason.  (i'm
assuming that *every* architecture *must* define clear_page() one way
or the other, is that correct?  that would seem fairly obvious, but
i just want to make sure i'm not missing anything obvious.)

fair enough.  *technically*, not every call of the form
"memset(ptr,0,PAGE_SIZE)" necessarily represents an address that's on
a page boundary.  but, *realistically*, i'm guessing most of them do.
just grabbing a random example from some grep output:
arch/sh/mm/init.c:
  ...
  /* clear the zero-page */
  memset(empty_zero_page, 0, PAGE_SIZE);
  ...
my only point here is that, given that every architecture needs to
supply some kind of definition of a "clear_page()" routine, one would
think that *lots* of those memset() calls could reasonably be
rewritten as a clear_page() call for improved readibility, no?
and there are a *lot* of memset() calls like that.
