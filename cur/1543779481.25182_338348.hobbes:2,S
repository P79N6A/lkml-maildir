Subject: [2.6 patch] i386: fix incorrect TSS entry for LDT
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/1/254

noticed by Chuck Ebbert: the .ldt entry of the TSS was set up
incorrectly. It never mattered since this was a leftover from
old times, so remove it.
