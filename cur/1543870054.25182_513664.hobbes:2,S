Ugh. I know nothing, nothing, nothing about suspend. I'll try to guess.
   Commit: ed746e3b18f4df18afa3763155972c5835f284c5
   [PATCH] swsusp: Change code ordering in disk.c
   Change the ordering of code in kernel/power/disk.c so that device_suspend() is
   called before disable_nonboot_cpus() and platform_finish() is called after
   enable_nonboot_cpus() and before device_resume(), as indicated by the recent
   discussion on Linux-PM (cf.
   
http://lists.osdl.org/pipermail/linux-pm/2006-November/004164.html
).
   The changes here only affect the built-in swsusp.
Yes? with the patch above, _cpu_down() called _after_ freeze_processes() ???
Honestly, I can't understand this (yes, I know nothing, nothing, nothing...).

How about other kthread_stop()s ? For example, kernel/softirq.c:cpu_callback() ?
I think we need a general "cpu_down() after freeze" implementation, this is what
Gautham and Srivatsa are working on, right?

I'm afraid this is racy. We can't touch *cwq, it may be freed. Suppose
that another thread does destroy_workqueue(), and we thaw that thread
before cwq->thread.
