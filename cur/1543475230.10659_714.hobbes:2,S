I recently upgraded to 2.2.0-pre4, and apparently have a problem nfs
locking files on an nfs server running 2.0.36 (pre 14, actually).
I am not sure whether this is a kernel bug or a configuration problem.
I use Debian's apt-get tool to keep my system current. It maintains a cache
of package files. A lock file is used to control access to the cache
directory. The cache directory is nfs mounted. This works on 2.0.36,
but not on 2.2.0-pre1 or pre4 - the versions I have tried.
The output from apt-get is:
fratercula# apt-get install blt8.0           
Updating package status cache...done
Checking system integrity...ok
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  blt8.0 
0 packages upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 140 not upgraded.
Need to get 0b/494k of archives. After unpacking 1150k will be used.
E: Could not get lock ../lock - open (37 No locks available)
E: Couldn't lock the Output dir, /var/cache/apt/archives/ another process is using it
On the client's console I see:
lockd: failed to monitor 192.168.1.1 (address of server)
the relevant part of strace is:
open("../lock", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0640) = 12
fcntl(12, F_SETLK, {type=F_WRLCK, whence=SEEK_SET, start=0, len=1}) = -1 ENOLCK (No record locks available)
From .config on the client system:
#
# Network File Systems
#
# CONFIG_CODA_FS is not set
CONFIG_NFS_FS=m
# CONFIG_NFSD is not set
CONFIG_SUNRPC=m
CONFIG_LOCKD=m
# CONFIG_SMB_FS is not set
# CONFIG_NCP_FS is not set
(Could NFSD not set, LOCKD set be a pathological combination?)
I hope I am not wasting your time.
Jon
