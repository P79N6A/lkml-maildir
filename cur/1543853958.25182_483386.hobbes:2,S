No indeed. You seem confused with remaining and new. 
It has one VMA (A) it needs to split that into two pieces, it happens to
do it like (B,A') where A' is the old VMA object with new a start
address, and B is a new VMA object.
If you'd unmapped the tail end of your region you'd then see a close of
A' but you happen to unmap the head so you'll see B closed.
vm_ops->open() is called on new VMA objects, in this scenario B is the
only new object created. A -> A' is not creating a new object just
modifying an old one.
