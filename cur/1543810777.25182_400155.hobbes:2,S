Looks good and tests ok, with one issue: I still have a preference for
returning -ENOTTY over 0/0/0 when dm doesn't know the geometry.  That
said, most programs will see the zero cylinder count and make a guess,
so it probably doesn't matter.
If you're happy with it, I say put it in.  Thanks for the cleanup, by
the way!
