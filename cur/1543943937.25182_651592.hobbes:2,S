wrong. The _x86_ memory hotplug code uses GFP_ATOMIC elsewhere.
The generic memory hotplug code does not.
and the x86 memory hotplug code uses GFP_ATOMIC and panic() elsewhere 
because:

and you had nothing to do with that "existing code"? git-log reveals 
that the GFP_ATOMIC and panic()-ing patch was added 2 years ago and was 
signed off by you:

    [PATCH] x86_64: add x86-64 support for memory hot-add
  [...]
  Signed-off-by: Andi Kleen <ak@suse.de>
We (like most upstream kernel subsystems) generally do not accept 
patches into arch/x86 that spreads a buggy implementation detail 
further. Please submit a patch that cleans up the mess. Thanks,
