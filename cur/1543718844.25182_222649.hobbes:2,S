Yup. Lookie here:
	#define __ACCESS_BITS   (_PAGE_ACCESSED | _PAGE_KRE | _PAGE_URE)
	extern inline pte_t pte_mkold(pte_t pte)        { pte_val(pte) &= ~(__ACCESS_BITS); return pte; }
Notice how an "old" pte won't be readable. Then, when we take the page 
fault, we'll do
	extern inline pte_t pte_mkyoung(pte_t pte)      { pte_val(pte) |= __ACCESS_BITS; return pte; }
and now the pte is readable again.
In other words, we absolutely _have_ to do the "pte_mkyoung()" part in the
page fault, or an "old" pte will never become readable again (unless it's
accessed with a write rather than a read, which will then happen to make
it young again).
I'm not quite senile yet.
