I use (kernel 2.4.4 and 2.4.5) a cron script that pings, and will run 
ifdown eth0; ifup eth0
when the ping fails, this seems to be good enough to get it up and running
again, sometimes I need to reload the module, but it's indeed very annoying.
if ! ping -c 1 -n -q 192.168.100.2 ; then
	ifdown eth0
	ifup eth0
	if ! ping -c 1 -n -q 192.168.100.2 ; then
		ifdown eth0
		rmmod epic100
		insmod epic100
		ifup eth0
