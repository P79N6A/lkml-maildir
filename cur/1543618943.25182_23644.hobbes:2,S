Do you have a printer? Try to boot while it is powered off.
WHAT is generating irq 7 now?
It is documented that interrupt controller will report irq 7 if it sees irq 
but cannot determine what device sends it. That's exactly what's happening 
when you see "spurious int" message.
You made kernel believe it's from printer. That does not cure the real 
problem. BTW, there's not much of a problem, kernel just ignores spurious 
interrupts. It _is_ a problem if you see 'ERR' number rapidly increasing.
