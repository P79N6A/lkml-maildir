Hi.  I have a RealTech 8139 Ethernet card and I am using kernel
2.2.18.  I tried to use the new driver 8139too as a module, but when
doing an insmod or modprobe on the module I got "symbol forparameter
debug not found".  There was nothing obvious in the module source, so
any assistance would be appreciated.
