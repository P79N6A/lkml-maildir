You can.  We just have to tell you how.
cd `bk bin`
vi import		# this is a shell script
Look for a call to "bk patch".
You will see some funny arguments, those are there to generate a list
of "creates" and "deletes" which are passed to renametool.  Instead 
of calling renametool, write your on way of doing text based rename
matchup and stick it in there.
Next problem, please :-)
