Well, it seems the network transport is slow. I have benchmarked 
using NFS, FTP and SCP and *all* of them are 4 orders of magnitude 
slower when sending data (from 2.5 to 2.4), but behave normally 
when receiving data (from 2.4 to 2.5).

The problem is that FTP is also four times slower. Here are my timings 
against 2.5.64 vanilla: 
 
Test case: 128MB file (dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=1024k count=128) 
 
NFS 
--- 
time cp 2.4 -> 2.5: 0m11.759s 
time cp 2.5 -> 2.4: 0m39.541s 
 
FTP 
--- 
time get 2.4 -> 2.5: 11.5s 
time put 2.5 -> 2.4: 43.3s 
 
So it seems a problem with the network transport. This doesn't 
happen with 2.4 on the same hardware: NEC Chrom@ laptop, 
TI CardBus bridge, 3Com Corporation 3CCFE575CT Cyclone 
CardBus (rev 10) NIC. 
 
Attached is my .config file. It's worth a look since I needed to 
build CardBus into the kernel (my RedHat distro doesn't work 
with CardBus built as a module).

During benchmarks with 2.5.64 I've also seen this errors, 
although they were quite few (only two). 
 
Now, what else? I'm lost... 
Thanks!
