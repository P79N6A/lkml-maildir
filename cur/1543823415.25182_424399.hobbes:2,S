Since it seems the NAK's of Christoph and Martin weren't enough:
  NAK++
How many more NAK's does it require to prevent offering a deprecated 
option on additional architectures?
This driver is declared obsolete since more than two years, and while 
it's worth a discussion how long to keep it for legacy users, merging a 
patch offering an obsolete driver for even more users is silly.
