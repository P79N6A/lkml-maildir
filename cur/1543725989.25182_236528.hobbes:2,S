I remember a race condition I thought was possible, but couldn't exactly
pin down the exact sequence.  Give me a chance to dig through some of
my notes and see what I come across.
I think I could understand this if there two messages with each invocation,
but not with one.
Marcin, you have a process with a Page Table Entry which indicates it is
pointing to a page which has been swapped out to block 0 of swap device
256.  This is probably caused by a problem in the kernel.  You can certainly
run memtest et al.  If you don't find anything, I would assume the problem
is in the kernel.
Most of the code in the area you would be affected by has changed
drastically in the 2.6 kernel.
Good Luck,
Robin Holt
