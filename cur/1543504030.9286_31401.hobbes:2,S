When it comes to price/performance for small systems, yes. But nothing
beats the price/performance of a Celeron for DSP... Or an Alpha AXP, if
you need LOTS of power.
However, as some posts in the late audio/signal processing/real time
discussion pointed out, extremely low latency processing is very hard to
do without entirely locking a CPU to the job. In some cases, normal DSPs
may be a better solution sometimes.
Personally, I think DSPs belong in small, highly specialzed
applications, like portable systems, industrial environments and that
kind of things.
Note: It's not only the cost of the chip that matters! Take a closer
look at a GOOD DSP development system... and then look at the price
tag... Besides, developing code for a DSP is always more complicated
than hacking native code on a workstation, even if you have very good
tools.
