Testing kernel rebuilds on a USB-HDD connected mass-storage, follow up 
to 2.4.34-pre1 'burped' report:
2.4.33: >100 rebuilds without error
2.4.34-pre1: 163 rebuilds without error, maybe I kicked the USB-HDD 
(it's on the floor ;) other day?  
Report other day seems to be a once off glitch, been running overnight at 
about 6 mins per rebuild from 'make mrproper' over USB2.0 link from Via 
chipset to Genesys GL811 USB <-> ATA/ATAPI bridge.
grant@sempro:~$ /sbin/lspci |grep USB

HDD is ten year old 815MB Toshiba MK1926FCV that throws a little fit if 
picked up while in operation.  It just did when I turned it over to 
see the part number.  No kernel build error this time though ;)
