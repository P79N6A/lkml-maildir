Hmmm. Note that the for(;;) { } provides no exit path.
So, you probably have some bad RAM or your CPU is too
hot (broken fan??), or something like that.

Looks very much like you have a real bad hardware problem.

Look inside and see if your CPU fan has stopped. Also move your RAM
sticks around after wiping any dirt off the contacts. Since the
