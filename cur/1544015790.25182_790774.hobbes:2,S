That'll teach me for trusting the board vendor's documentation. :)

Unfortunately, however, even enabling UOC in the BIOS does not make the 
USB connection work. The symptoms are exactly the same as before.
I'm going to try to figure out how to get at those two bits, and also will 
start talking with the board vendor as well (since it's starting to look more 
and more like a BIOS and/or HW problem).
Thanks for your help so far!
