Please don't.  This patch fails to link for me in -rc5 - the errors start like
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x18b): In function `vgacon_deinit':

and go on for another couple hundred lines.
IIRC, I found fixes for these when I merged this into my tree.  It's a nice 
addition, but there are aspects of this that I don't like, which is why I
haven't sent it in myself.  Again, IIRC, enabling this disables the normal 
consoles, which is fairly unfriendly.
