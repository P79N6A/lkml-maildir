I'm sorry for lack of explanations.
The patch changes sys_rt_sigreturn(), it means GCC might generate
different code for that function. And might be different size, it causes
all codes after sys_rt_sigreturn() will looks different.
So I think you can see the difference begins from sys_rt_sigreturn().

thanks for uploading vmlinux, will see the difference.
And sorry again, actually, it's just for my curiosity.
I'd like to know what difference this is.
On my environment GCC(4.2.4-1ubuntu3 and 4.3.2) generates same binary...

Yeah, Ingo knows what GCC does. I don't know so much.
