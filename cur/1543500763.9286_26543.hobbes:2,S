Errr... Call me stupid, but..
Blocking interrupts does just that: nothing else (spin_{,un}lock_irq don't
define a 'critical section', but they don't need to on UP). We're never called
from interrupt context as far as I can see, so we don't need to do it? SMP is
obviously a different matter, but that's what vanilla spinlocks are for in
the first place, surely?

Yes, but user space can't trigger access from interrupt context, can it?
It's just a syscall, so we're executing normally but in kernel context. bh's
are run by the scheduler in between tasks; actually, it also ensures IIUC that
they're not entered on more than one CPU at once, but as you point out a
normal task could enter ip_masq_uctl() outside of the BH on a different CPU
on SMP.
BTW:
Are all accesses to ip_masq_user_hook in ip_masq.c done with the kernel lock
held? If not, there might be a problem there too.
