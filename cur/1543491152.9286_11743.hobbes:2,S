I'm trying to run an apache w3server on a nfs mounted
linux-system. One thing doesn't work .. the logfiles
are not written anymore.
Can anybody tell me how I can make this work ? I
think it has something to do with the nfs file locking. 
I'm using the kernel based nfs stuff.
I cant find information on this.
