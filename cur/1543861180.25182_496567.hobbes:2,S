Ok. Have you ever tried to limit the drivers you have loaded? I notice you 
had the prism54 wireless thing in your modules list and the vt1211 hw 
monitoring thing. I'm wondering about the vt1211 thing - it probably isn't 
too common. But if you can use that machine without the wireless too, it 
might be good to try without either.
(The rest of your module list looked bog-standard, so if it's not 
hardware-specific, I don't think it's there)
Turning of the VIA sound driver just in case would be good too.
The reason I mention vt1211 in particular is that it does things like 
regulate fan activity etc. Is the problem perhaps heat-related?
