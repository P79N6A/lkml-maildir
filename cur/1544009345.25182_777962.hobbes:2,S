This same MCE happens every time I boot the 2.6.27.8 kernel, but it
never happens with kernel 2.6.26.8. It appears every time at log time
[  301.7320xx](where the x represent the scale of the approximation).
In the previous log it appeared at [  301.732037], now it appeared at
[  301.732042]. It happens just once at that moment and then never
more until I reboot. No MCE gets logged with kernel 2.6.26.8 nor with
Windows Vista 32bit, not even under very heavy load on memory and
cpu(like 3d games or 3d mark vintage). Is this really an hardware
problem? Why does it get logged only on kernel 2.6.27.8 at that exact
moment? Now I'm gonna compile kernel 2.6.28-rc7 and see if there it
happens too. Any suggestion? It would be appreciated, because,
depending on the final result, I may be forced to change the
hardware(It's still guaranteed, but it'd mean some months without a
pc).
