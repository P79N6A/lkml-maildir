It was demonstrated useful for some specific cases, like context switch early
fetch on IA64. But I agree the prefetch on each list_for_each() is probably
a bad idea and should be removed. Will also help code size.
The best strategy is probably to figure out which oprofile counters
to use and then do some profiling and only insert prefetches where
the profiler actually finds significant cache misses.
