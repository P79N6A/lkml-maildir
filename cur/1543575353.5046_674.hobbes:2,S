Neither works. I'm using gcc 2.95-3 on RHL 6.2
In desperation, I removed the source tree and started afresh from test1.
These are the commands I used:
[summer@possum src]$ cat reinstall
#!/bin/bash
set -ex
cd /usr/src
rm -rf linux
tar Ixf /u03/kernels/patches/linux-2.4.0-test1.tar.bz2
dir -1rt `find /u03/kernels/patches/ -name patch-2.4.0-t\*.gz -newer 
/u03/kernels/patches/patch-2.4.0-test1.gz` | xargs --max-lines=1 gzip -dc | 
patch -p0
find linux -name \*.rej
cd linux
make mrproper
cp /u03/kernels/configs/possum-2.4.0-test11.config .config
make dep bzImage modules
and it still did not build.
In a hunch, i tried this:
set -ex
cd /usr/src
rm -rf linux
tar Ixf /u03/kernels/patches/linux-2.4.0-test1.tar.bz2
dir -1rt `find /u03/kernels/patches/ -name patch-2.4.0-t\*.gz -newer 
/u03/kernels/patches/patch-2.4.0-test1.gz` | xargs --max-lines=1 gzip -dc | 
patch -p0
find linux -name \*.rej
cd linux
make mrproper
cp /u03/kernels/configs/possum-2.4.0-test11.config .config
make oldconfig dep bzImage modules
and the oldconfig resulting in me bing asked three questions (and not those 
new in test11).
The result builds.
It seems to me that some of the various "make *config" options have the 
ability to create defective configurations in some circumstances.
I'm off to enjoy my new kernel now;-)
