Hi Herbert,
Thanks for reply.
I will file this for when needed again for future reference, as I have moved 
back to 2.6.4 kernel, as that tree never once produces a kswapd oops and just 
runs and runs and runs.
I just don't know why > 2.6.4 kernels produce oops on my system - I have been 
through change log looking at all the relevant stuff, but can't really see 
anything obvious.  I have built kernels 'clean' from bottom up, but all 
produce kswapd oops within a few days - except 2.6.4.
I wish this box wasn't my LAN gateway, otherwise I wouldn't mine when it does 
go AWOL and I could debug at my leisure.
Thanks for help,
Nick
