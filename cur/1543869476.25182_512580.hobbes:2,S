Keep in mind that setting nvidiafb to totally ignore the EDID (either
by not compiling in EDID support or by using e.g. the ignoreedid patch
I had proposed) the snow effect is extremely reduced, to the point of
being barely perceptible during normal usage (not as clean as X, but
still very good).
Also, I'm wondering if it might be worth looking at the progress done
in nouveau, and the drm stuff they've implemented (or at least the new
memory management and maybe some of the 2D stuff).
