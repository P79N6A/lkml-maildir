Fair enough - it's certainly saner this way.
Ordinarily it would be nicer to add a new function for this, say
	ll_sync_write_bufs(struct buffer_head **bufs, int nr)
rather than adding new interpretations to ll_rw_block().
But ll_rw_block() is such a familiar old thing that I guess there's not
much advantage in adding some new thing for people to remember.
