Color me a bit skeptical...  we've always had this capability really: 
for multi-function devices, just register as many subsystems as you 
need.  If your device is a network _and_ SCSI device, you can do that 
with today's APIs.
I just went through a long thread (e1000/e1000e) explaining how much 
pain multiple drivers for the same PCI ID cause on the distro side of 
things...  its a mess.  In each case you must write special case code to 
resolve the ambiguity.  You never know which is the best driver to 
choose, or proper module load order -- which may vary depending on 
machine, not just static information captured from a kernel Makefile.
