I am running with 2MB limit right now. I doubt 2MB will lead to OOM.

xargs is very ugly. I want to rm 12*. Just plain "rm 12*". *Not* "find
. -name "12*" | xargs rm, which has terrible issues with files names
"xyzzy"
"bla"
"xyzzy bla"
"12 xyzzy bla"
!
I do not want to deal with xargs. Xargs was made to workaround
limitation at command line size (and is broken in itself). Now we have
hardware that can handle bigger commandlines just fine, xargs should
be killed.
