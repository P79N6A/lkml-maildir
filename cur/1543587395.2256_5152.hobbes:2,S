You mean without dropping out_of_memory() test in kswapd and calling
oom_kill() in page fault [i.e. without additional patch]? Yes, you're
competely true but I have the patch [see example below, 'm1' is the bad
guy] just didn't have time to extensively test it and don't know whether
there is side efffects getting rid of this infinite looping in
__alloc_pages() but locked up processes apparently don't make people
very happy ;)
