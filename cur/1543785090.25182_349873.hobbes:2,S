Thanks, that helped.
The reason was that Acer BIOS left only _two_ bus numbers available
for _three_ cardbus controllers, so pci_scan_bridge() assigns both
numbers to the first controller and leaves two other ones uninitialized.
Please try the patch here, but note that you'll apparently have only
one cardbus slot working. If you want more, use "pci=assign-busses"
boot option.
Ivan.
