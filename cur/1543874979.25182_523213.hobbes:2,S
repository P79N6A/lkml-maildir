Oh noes. Please use a linked list (kmalloc cope = perfect) if you really need
loads of loopdevs. Sorta
 struct loopdev {
    struct list_head lh;
    int lo_number;
 };
to keep the /dev/loop%d number consistent across loopdev removal.
Maybe it's better to even use an rbtree (linked list does not scale to it).
