clear_bit per se is defined as an atomic operation with no implications 
for release or acquire. If it is used for release then either add the 
appropriate barrier or use MODE_RELEASE explicitly.
It precise the uncleanness in ia64 that such semantics are attached to 
these bit operations which may lead people to depend on those. We need to 
either make these explicit or not depend on them.
