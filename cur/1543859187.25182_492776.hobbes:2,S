the kfree/vfree thing at MINIMUM should be changed though. Even if you
need both kfree and vfree, you should key it off of a flag that you
store, not off the address of the memory, that's just unportable and
highly fragile. You *know* which allocator you used, so store it and use
THAT info.

hmm 64Kb is a bit much indeed. You can't do an array of upto 16 entries
with one page in each array entry?

that is just plain incorrect. Vmalloc is really really slow, both in
allocating and in use. During use you trash the 4Kb tlbs all the time
for example, and that's just cost that accumulates.

cleanest is probably the array of pages thing. to index it then you
first calculate which entry to use (that's half a cycle since it's a
power of 2) and then you index inside that page... that's going to be
faster than the tlb miss no doubt.
