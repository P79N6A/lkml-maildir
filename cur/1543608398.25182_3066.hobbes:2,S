Hmm.
The initial question was how to do
find / -name foo 2> /dev/null 
or similar if /dev/null is not present. (Eat is a place holder for a
imaginary progrom acting as /dev/null replacement).
I guess 
find / -name foo 2>/dev/stdout 1>/dev/stderr | eat
would (kinda) work, but it fails if you want to do
find / -name foo 2> /dev/null | less
Can be done with named pipes, though.
