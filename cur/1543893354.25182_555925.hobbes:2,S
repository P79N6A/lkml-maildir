I think what was meant here was to remove _all_ the macros that you
assigned to the ARRAY_SIZE() macro.
If you look at the two advantages replacing code with the ARRAY_SIZE()
macro has;
1. More readable/consistent code.
2. Faster compile times, because of less macros being defined.
If you were to simply redefine other macro's to be an ARRAY_SIZE()
macro, the code will still contain the original macro's that people
will have to look up, so would _not_ be more readable/consistent and
you now have two stages of macro replacement, so the code will
actually take _longer_ to compile.
So to get the benefit of this change you have to _remove_ all the
macros that are somehow equivalent to ARRAY_SIZE(), and replace their
use in the code, with an appropriate ARRAY_SIZE() usage.
