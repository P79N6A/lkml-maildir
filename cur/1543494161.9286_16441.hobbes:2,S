The card can't 'cause' collisions. It only detects collisions. The
most common cause of collisions on networks that handle both 100 and
10 mbs are the boxes that translate between these two speeds. If you
have 100 mb/s into a switch, and it's feeding out to a 10/mbs line,
something has to give. The "give" is that the switch causes a collision
as a throttle. The hardware automatically retries up to 15 times
upon a collision so such throttling is transparent.
