-mcpu is taken care of by -march in gcc3
-O4 does nothing, -O3 is the highest gcc3 goes, and -O3 does cause 
problems with certain code.
I'd suggest also -ftracer as it is supposed to help your standard -O2 
level optimizations do their jobs. How well, probably not very noticable 
in real life, but then neither is -march=pentium3 over i686.

basically, makefiles are supposed to add the value of CFLAGS to their 
flag variable.  CXXFLAGS for c++ arguments. But i understand why the 
kernel doesn't do this since it needs strict management over the build.
