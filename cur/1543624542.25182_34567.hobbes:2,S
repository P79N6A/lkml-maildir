You answers have only addressed BLOCK, you have yet to address the
hardware.  If you think this is a game, it is not.  It is to try and get a
point across so that we can move forward.  It is the same problem you have
in 2.5.  I can post the solution to the hardware atomic.  It does not
address the data integrity violations force upon it.
So if you think this is class fine.  It is really a an issue of shared
learning.  You brought me back up to date on how BLOCK behaves because I
forgot.  All I ma trying to do is bring you up to date on how the hardware
works.  But if you will not communitcate so I can see how far you have the
point in question it will never be resolved.
Also, I know you well enough.  If there is an issue you do/will/can not
address you go quiet.
If you do not understand, I want to help you to.
I accepted your help when you offered it and thanked you for it.

Andre Hedrick
