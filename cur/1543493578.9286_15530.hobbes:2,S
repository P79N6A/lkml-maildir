2.2.5 crash after/during heavy file transfer.
[2.]
I was doing a mget of almost my entire /usr/src directory between two
networked computers when suddenly the server (running 2.2.5) hang. I am not
sure whether this has anything to do with the crash though.

kernel, networking
[4.]
Linux version 2.2.5 (root@7of9) (gcc version egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3
release))
[5.]
No oops (or at least none that I could see, when I came home the keyboard
didn't respond so all I saw was a frozen screensaver and a reset button.
However, /var/log/syslog has:
