Hi!
   I was investigating memory allocation problems on my systems.
   And I only figured out that I'm using quite up-to-date kernel - 2.4.22.
   This is my post from another thread:

   "overcommit_memory < 0" supposed to not allow apps to overallocate 
memory - but still it works not like it is said in 
Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt.
    So apps which try to be MM friendly can silently break due to 
very-very lazy memory allocation in kernel. Not nice when malloc() says 
"everything is fine!".
   [ Just checked: with overcommit==-1, as soon app trying to touch 
those magic 2.8GB of memory, it gets killed by oom_killer. This is 
totally wrong... ]
   Probably fix docs at least... :-(
