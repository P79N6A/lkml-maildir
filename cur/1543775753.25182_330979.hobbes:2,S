kernel : 2.6.11 from kernel-tree 2.6.11-7 on debian  sid
psmouse module install automatically when booting the system (nothing write in /etc/modules, don't know why it's now automatically install) and dmesg says
input: ImExPS/2 Logitech explorer mouse on isa0060/serio1
everythings good
but the middle button (button 2) doesn't work (nothing with xev)
if I rmmod psmouse and then
modprobe psmouse proto=exps
then dmesg says
input: ImExPS/2 Generic explorer mouse on isa0060/serio1
and then my mouse works good, the button 2 works.
I send this just for information.
PS: it looks like the serio1 is my keyboard and that the mouse is on serio0.
