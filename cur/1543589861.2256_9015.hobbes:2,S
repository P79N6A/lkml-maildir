Okay, I finally got one of the workstations that failed and I was able
to try your 6.1.13 driver (on top of 2.4.4). 6.1.13 fixes the problem
that vanilla 2.4.4 gave me upon boot, in that it properly detects all
SCSI devices, the first disk as well (that was a problem formerly).
Thanks a lot. (Might it be a good idea to ask Linus and Alan to update the
driver they ship in 2.4.5-pre or 2.4.4-ac, respectively?)
