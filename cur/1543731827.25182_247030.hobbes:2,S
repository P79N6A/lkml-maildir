The name for the file stream and the directory would be the same,
distinguished by how they're used.  I.e. fopen("filedirname", "rw")
gets the stream, while chdir("filedirname") changes into the directory.
fopen("filedirname/substream", "rw"); opens some stream inside
the directory - as usual.
My idea is that the "extra streams" aren't special at all, they
are simply files in a directory and will therefore work with
any normal tool.  cd'ing into such a directory won't be special
either - because it is a plain directory. A collection of named streams
is usually a bunch of files in a directory - nothing new there.
Someone serving files for clients using
other os'es may attach special meaning to them, but I don't see the need
for a special meaning under linux.
So the only new thing is that the directory have a stream of
its own.  Then there must be a way to turn a ordinary
file into such a directory - people may then implement
thumbnails, summaries and so on as substreams.  Where
the substreams really are plain files in this slightly
special directory.
Perhaps mkdir with an existing filename could succeed,
creating a mixed file/directory, if the underlying fs support it.

An alternative: support open("filename/icon", O_CREAT);
and have this turn "filename" into file-as-directory if it wasn't so
already.  Then it works both with files and directories.
A new flag might be needed if old programs somehow depend on the stuff
above failing for plain files.

No problem with openat()
