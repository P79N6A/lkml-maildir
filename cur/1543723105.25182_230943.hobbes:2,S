the vulnerabilities are real for any application/protocol which makes use 
of long-duration TCP sessions.
the most common place that people have found the vulnerability to be of use 
is in killing BGP sessions.
protocols which make use of long-held TCP sessions such as NFSv3, irc, 
nntp, telnet, ssh, X11 et al are just as vulnerable.
