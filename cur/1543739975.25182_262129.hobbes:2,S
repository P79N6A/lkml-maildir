So you have two bk trees, 
- patches good for mainstream
- patches good for -mm tree
It would be cool if all the maintainers could adopt your working method,
Andrew is already automatically pulling from a bunch of trees, why not
having Linusdoing the same too?
Something like:
linux-2.6.XX is released
- Linus pull from all the "patches good for mainstream" bk trees and
from the equivalent Andrew tree (that doesn't exist at the moment)
- Linus release the first -pre release
- Linus gets other patches according to the "old" method
- Linus releases the -pre/-rc
Is it just a stupid idea ?
