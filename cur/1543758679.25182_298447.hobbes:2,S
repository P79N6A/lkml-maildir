If you have an Asus AS99127F chip, the value reported before in sysfs 
were not correct, the new ones are.

40 degrees C is a fairly reasonable temperature for a CPU diode, there's 
nothing to be afraid of. At any rate it's more reasonable than the 
incredibly low 20 degrees C temperature you had before, as Robert 
Hancock noticed in an earlier post.
Hope that helps,
