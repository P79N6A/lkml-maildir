I'm trying to remember why we ever would have needed to zero out the pagetable
pages if we're taking down the whole mm?  Maybe it's because "oh, the
arch wants to put this page into a quicklist to recycle it", which is
all rather circular.
It would be interesting to look at a) leave the page full of random garbage
if we're releasing the whole mm and b) return it straight to the page allocator.
