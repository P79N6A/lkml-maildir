Clearly you have the resources and motivation to do whatever you can
to get the very best performance out of the system.

Yes.

For a kernel, "excellence" includes providing support for a wide
variety of user software. That includes yucky stuff like DOSEMU,
MP3 players that don't skip under heavy system load, and mmap()
for simple file access.

There are many ways to judge "usefulness". There is no single best
solution for most interesting problems.
It seems to me that people who work hard to get the very best
performance have trouble understanding why anyone would settle
for less. Why doesn't everybody use a dvorak keyboard? The dvorak
keyboard is clearly superior to the common junk. I hope everyone
arguing against DIPC uses one.
You have chosen mediocrity if you do not use dvorak keyboard layout.
I'd love to see a justification for non-dvorak keyboards which does
not also apply to DIPC. The traditional layout is kernel bloat too,
unless a newly loaded  layout overwrites the old one.

Certainly. From a kernel viewpoint, DIPC is not a fundamental architecture
decision. It is only an extension to the existing SysV IPC code.

No, it is unreasonable. Performance is only one of many ways to judge
a feature. Obviously DIPC is not for him or you.

Yes. We may disagree about how one determines superiority.

If you have computer time left over, maybe you didn't need to optimize
so much. :-)
I would be happy to see several DIPC implementations benchmarked
against each other, but it is rather pointless to benchmark DIPC
against something else. Everybody agrees what the result will be.
I was truly surprised by the DIPC ease-of-use today. The worst part
by far is setting up the new kernel and rebooting. Changes to the
application code are trivial. You could use a perl one-liner for it.
Conversion to MPI is far more complicated.
