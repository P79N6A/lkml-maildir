Thanks. I didn't know about allconfig. That sounds good.. But no,
it wouldn't exactly work for me just like that - I don't have space
to do the actual kernel compilation on any machine (nor time to do it,
since the fastest machine is my laptop at 1.13GHz, and that suffers from
overheating problems - the next fastest machine is a dual 550MHz, and I
will start that churning but space is tight everywhere  and I am pretty
sure that there is no chance to get it to go to a finish as is).

Has anyone already done it? I was hoping there was somebody running a
big compile every day in order to check consistency. Then I could
simply "borrow" their files!
Failing that, I'll try setting CC to something like FOO, and seeing if
I can generate the .o.cmd files without the compilation actually being
done. Hmmm ...
