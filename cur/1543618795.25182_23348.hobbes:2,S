sparc64 has an in-kernel thunk layer that lets it run sparc32 binaries,
and a sparc32 userland.
Presumeably the standard benefits apply for 32 over 64 bits, such as
lower I-cache usage and smaller programs overall.  Though most
Linux/Unix applications seem to work ok on 64-bit, (a) some don't and
(b) few apps actually take good advantage of 64-bit machine int and
address space.
Of course, all that said, coming from an Alpha AXP background I prefer
64-bit userland ;-)
