This is a good point -- it does look odd. I'm considering:
DEFINE_TASK_INITCALL(audit_alloc);
With others like:
DEFINE_TASK_EXITCALL()
DEFINE_TASK_CLONECALL()
etc.
That resembles other macros which create variables. Though I'm not sure
this patten is appropriate because these variables should not be used by
name.
Seems that no matter what something about it is going to be unusual. :)
