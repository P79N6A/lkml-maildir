To the contrary.
If you take a look at clamshell cellphone, it often has small status
display on the outside; sometimes black&white. (What I'm trying to say
is "this kind of status displays is going to become very common in future).
And fbcon is perfectly capable of driving your display, and there are
no downsides in using fbcon to do that... and when your VGA card dies,
you'll be able to login using keyboard + tiny display :-))).
