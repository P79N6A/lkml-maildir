Sure, but my point is that if the kernel is considered special and the 
best optimization for the kernel is therefore between -Os and -O2, we 
should try to find this point of best optimization.
This should address Arjans point that -Os might not be best choice for 
best performance (and it's actually our fault if gcc generates stupid 
but small code when we use -Os).
