I tried simply swapping "tristate" for "bool":

 	depends on HP_SIMSERIAL
 
 config HP_SIMSCSI
-	tristate "Simulated SCSI disk"
+	bool "Simulated SCSI disk"

 endmenu
... and now it fails in a new an diferent way:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/ia64/hp/sim/built-in.o(.init.text+0x9d2): In function `simscsi_init':
arch/ia64/hp/sim/simscsi.c:407: undefined reference to `scsi_host_alloc'

arch/ia64/hp/sim/built-in.o(.init.text+0xa22):arch/ia64/hp/sim/simscsi.c:413: undefined reference to `scsi_scan_host'
presumably because we have CONFIG_HP_SIMSCSI=y but CONFIG_SCSI=m
[Which I don't understand ... HP_SIM_SCSI "depends on SCSI", so
 how did make allmodconfig come up with this combination?].

P.S. Next layer of the onion is CONFIG_BLK_DEV_AMD74XX ... perhaps
that needs to be "depends on X86"?
