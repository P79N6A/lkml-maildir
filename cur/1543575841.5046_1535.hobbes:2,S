Yes, this will be fixed today.  The aic7xx directory will build the module
or main driver file into the scsi directory so that no files need to be
renamed.  This also means that the module name can remain the same.

It was supposed to be part of the patches for 2.2.18 (each kernel version
requires a slightly different Makefile which is why it is not included
in the main source ball).

There is no way to remove those files other than instructing the user to
do so or to execute a script.

Blah.  I'd rather prove the utility of the new driver prior to having
it incorporated into the kernel tree and at that point have it as a
full replacement.  Otherwise there is just too much room for confusion.
