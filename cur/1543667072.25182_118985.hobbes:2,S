It goes BUG in try_to_free_buffers().
We really should fix this up for other reasons, probably by making ext3's
per-page truncate operations wait on commit, and be more aggressive about
pulling the page's buffers off the transaction at truncate time.
The same thing _could_ happen with other filesystems; not too sure about
that.
Still.  I suggest you look at freeing up page->list from anon/swapcache
pages.  It really doesn't do much.
Meanwhile, I backed out that bit - I don't actually see where the failure is
anyway.  The page is page_mapped(), !PageAnon and ->mapping == NULL.
