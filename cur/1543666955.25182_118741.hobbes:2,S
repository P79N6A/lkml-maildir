Hi,
	I have come across this problem when implementing a sockets
interface to our X.25 card.  On the thread that wants to close the socket,
it must first issue a shutdown().  This will unblock the read() or poll().
And then you can do the close().

You can't do poll on a file, it won't tell you anything useful, so I assume
you mean a socket.

Can you show code with this problem?
