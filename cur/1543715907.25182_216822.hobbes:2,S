Subject: New ide-proc warning from min/max changes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This is 2.6.6-rc3 on a sparc64. This warning has appeared with the
IDE min/max changes:
  CC      drivers/ide/ide-proc.o
drivers/ide/ide-proc.c: In function `proc_ide_write_settings':
drivers/ide/ide-proc.c:511: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
The line in question is
len = min(p - start, MAX_LEN);
where p and start are pointers of type "const char *" and MAX_LEN is
#define MAX_LEN 30
