What's new:
 * It can now make use of a dedicated Linux syscall rather than an ioctl() to 
   provide some Win32 functions.
 * There is a patch for strace-4.2 included to view usage of this syscall.
 * It has an RPC mechanism allowing a server process to gain controlled access
   to a client's VM.
 * Some bug fixes.
It can be downloaded from:
