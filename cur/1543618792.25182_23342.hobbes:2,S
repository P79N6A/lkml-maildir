Greetings,
Reason for posting/sending this email.
1. the actual message:
pppoe[1857]: Linux select bug hit! This message is harmless, but please
ask the Linux kernel developers to fix it.
I connect to the InterNet via my ADSL provider. From time to time, my
adsl connection dies and following it, i receive a message in my logs
concerning a Linux bug hit.
I'm using N_HDLC line discipline for synchronous mode.
The adsl daemon is provided by the rp-pppoe package. If for any reasons,
anyone on this list wishes to look in further, please contact me, so
that i can provide them with more accurate information.
Currently running: kernel 2.4.17
At this moment i'm using kernel mode pppoe, and i havent seen "linux 
select bug hit" At the time that i wrote this email i was using the 
regular pppoe mode with n_hdlc line discipline.
