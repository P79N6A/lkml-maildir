i am having a similar problem, i'm thinking somthing in the XFS software is
malloc()ing ram and not letting it go, by any chance are you using XFS ?
what i did was write this lil things to recover my ram,it eats ram till it's
killed effectivly recovering lost ram (i just had to include this)
---ayrabtu.c---
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        char *allyourram;
        char arebelongtous[] = "all your ram are belong to us";
        while (1) {
                allyourram = malloc(30);
                sprintf(allyourram, "%s", arebelongtous);
        }
        return(0);
}
