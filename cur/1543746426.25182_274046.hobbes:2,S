ah, indeed. I thought i fixed all these places but you are right that
there's one more instance remaining, in pick_new_owner():
+               if (w->task->policy == SCHED_NORMAL)
+                       break;

ok, this is an important one too. Fixing this bug will complicate
pi_setprio() some more, but should be pretty straightforward: the task
that is boosted can be blocked on a single rt-mutex at most.
i'll fix these bugs in the next release. Your systematic testing of PI
is very useful, it already uncovered _tons_ of PI bugs that would be
quite hard to find via normal testing.

correct.

thx, i'll add this too. Do you have uploaded the matching pi_test
userspace changes too? (url?)
