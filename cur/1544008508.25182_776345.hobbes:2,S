SMSC LAN91C111 *does* still exist on ISA platforms (for example PC104), 
but
Luotao is right: the smc91x driver support for it is broken.
I have one here on an ISA board (and it took me a long time to find 
working PC
hardware old enough to use this!).  I'll send a patch when I can find time 
to
fix it, but until then I agree this broken code should be removed.
