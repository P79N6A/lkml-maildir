but...  It would be a mistake for an application to assume that it is
allowed to _use_ all the present CPUs.  People can and do run applications
within cpusets, and under sched_setaffinity().
So I'd have thought that in general an application should be querying its
present affinity mask - something like sched_getaffinity()?  That fixes the
CPU hotplug issues too, of course.
But we discussed this all a couple years back and it was decided that
sched_getaffinity() was unsuitable.  I remember at the time not really
understanding why?
