Patch looks like it solved the problem.  6 kernel compiles
and 6 mke2fs with bad block scans and the system is still
up.
The only thing I'm still seeing that is unusual is this kernel
message:
   ide: no cache flush required.
which only shows up in the file:
   ./drivers/ide/ide-disk.c:
Nothing seams to come of them, but in the average boot I see
25 or so of them.  They did not show up under linux-2.4.21-pre3.
As near as I can tell they are generated when an ide device is
closed.
