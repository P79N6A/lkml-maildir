Due to the restrictions caused by the new new kernel development model,
I'm unable to merge this for 2.6.13.  I already have other stuff already
queued in my serial tree which probably isn't suitable for merging.
If someone else (Andrew or Adam) wishes to merge this then fine - it
looks reasonable.  Let me know what you're doing so I know whether to
add it to my serial tree or not.
