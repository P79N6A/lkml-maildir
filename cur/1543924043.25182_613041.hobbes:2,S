Hi,
The message "START_STOP FAILED" appears
 after I eject pcmcia-ATA card by "pccardctl eject".
Is this correct?
>pccard: card ejected from slot 0
>ata3.00: disabled
>sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] Stopping disk
>sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] START_STOP FAILED
>sd 2:0:0:0: [sdb] Result: hostbyte=DID_BAD_TARGET driverbyte=DRIVER_OK,SUGGEST_OK
Best Regards
Komuro
