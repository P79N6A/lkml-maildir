Sorry, my fault entirely. This is the first time that I have used kernel
2.4, and I wasn't used to the menuconfig and missed the DMA options out
(they weren't enabled by default).
The revised comparison between 2.2.15 and 2.4.0-test5 are as follows:
==> 2.2.15 <==
 Dir   Size   BlkSz  Thr#  Read (CPU%)   Write (CPU%)   Seeks (CPU%)
----- ------ ------- ---- ------------- -------------- --------------
/mnt/  256    4096    1   27.1371 10.3% 26.7979 23.0%  146.187 0.95%
/mnt/  256    4096    2   27.1219 10.7% 26.6606 23.2%  142.233 0.60%
/mnt/  256    4096    4   26.9915 10.6% 26.4289 22.9%  142.789 0.50%
/mnt/  256    4096    16  26.4320 10.5% 26.1310 23.0%  147.424 0.52%
/mnt/  256    4096    32  25.3407 10.1% 25.6822 22.7%  150.750 0.57%
==> 2.4.0-test5 <==
 Dir   Size   BlkSz  Thr#  Read (CPU%)   Write (CPU%)   Seeks (CPU%)
----- ------ ------- ---- ------------- -------------- --------------
/mnt/  256    8192    1   23.4496 9.70% 24.1711 20.6%  139.941 0.88%
/mnt/  256    8192    2   16.9398 7.53% 24.0482 20.3%  136.706 0.69%
/mnt/  256    8192    4   15.0166 6.82% 23.7892 20.2%  139.922 0.69%
/mnt/  256    8192    16  13.5901 6.38% 23.2326 19.4%  147.956 0.70%
/mnt/  256    8192    32  13.3228 6.36% 22.8210 19.0%  151.544 0.73%
So we're still seeing a drop in performance with 1 thread, and still
seeing the same severe degradation 2.2.16 exhibits.

Sorry, I don't understand this. Could you explain it to me? Will this be
a specific option on the kernel config?
Thanks,
Corin
PS Sorry about the DMA oversight.
