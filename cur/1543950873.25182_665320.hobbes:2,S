The patch silenced the warning, but I still got a BUG() in
cache_alloc_refill() shortly after loading the test module.
(The machine needs some activity before the BUG() happens,
a few sync;dmesg;ps commands suffice for me.)
If I change the test module to do the sysdev_register stuff
once in module_init and the unregister stuff once in module_exit,
as opposed to once per "session" using the device, then things
work fine and I can't crash the kernel even if I repeatedly
insmod and rmmod the module. This indicates that some other part
of the sysdev object's state, apart from the state_initialized
flag, must also be cleaned up in the unregister() path.
I'll continue investigating this tomorrow.
