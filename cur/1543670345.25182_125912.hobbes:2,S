Hi.
I've tried running a few bonnie++ benchmarks but I'm not understaning
how to tune the options. Nor can I figure out much form the output
because I don't understand what the options do... 
I went to the programs homepage but theres no info on this.
This is the string I used to measure my single HD throughput. This
because I want to compare it with the RAID system I will soon implement.
bonnie++ -d /mnt/download/hd_tests/ -s:1024:32k -m Gaia -r 512 -x 2 -u
antonio -f | bon_csv2txt
And this is the output:
Version  1.02b      ------Sequential Output------ --Sequential Input- --Random-
                    -Per Chr- --Block-- -Rewrite- -Per Chr- --Block-- --Seeks--

----------------end of first test-------------------
If my filesys is ext3 with 4K blocks must I use a 4K chunk-size? Is this
what the chunk-size is for?? 
Why is the "sequential create --> read" empty? I would like to
understand how fast is my HD in reading but can't get it from the
above...
Would be greatfull if someone could help me with this stuff. A nice link
to some www page would do fine. I tried with google but can't find much
that is helpfull.
Thanks
