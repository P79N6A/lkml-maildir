BTW, I believe I have already found one bug in ne2k-pci.c.  The bug
is in ne2k_pci_block_input() and ne2k_pci_block_output().  The code
checks if ONLY_16BIT_IO is set or not.  If not, it will try to read/write
using 32bit mode, into/from the buffer (skb->data).  However, 
skb->data is NOT aligned along 4-byte boundary (See related sbk_reserve(2)
calls in 8390.c).  This causes bus error on my MIPS board.
What should be the right fix?  I currently use a separate buffer, which is
aligned along 4-byte boundary, to copy into/from skb->data to do the IO.
Obviously, this is not good.
I also tried to change from skb_reserve(2) skb_reserve(4).  That seems
to causes some other problem.  (OK, I admit I am quite ignorant about
ether driver.)
