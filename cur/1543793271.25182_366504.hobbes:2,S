I suspect that building drivers out of tree doesn't work very well with
the new "merged" architecture where includes are split between asm/ppc
and asm-powerpc... You should make sure that you build the driver with
the same ARCH as the kernel, that is ARCH=powerpc at least, if we got
the Makefiles right, that should give you all the headers...
(building glibc is definitely a pain :)
