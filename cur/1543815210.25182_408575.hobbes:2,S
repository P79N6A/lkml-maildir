It is still in -mm so there is sufficient time to comment.  My apologies
for not cc'ing you.

Well it is a bunch of cleanups to the implementation of /proc not
really a big user visible change.  The problem is that the implementation
is a maintenance nightmare.
There are some significant changes on my todo list to cope
with multiple processes having the same pid but those have not
happened yet.

So I did not break the fact that stat() works.  But now
stat does not give you the euid on if the task is not dumpable.

All of which sounds sane.  Although I wonder if the kernel side
implementation of the status file was improved if that could
help things.
Looking at 2.4 and 2.2 this case does seem to be consistently
maintained, although I'm not at all certain if the application
changed it's euid that the change would be reflected in /proc,
until the version of revalidate in 2.6.
My real problem with the implementation is the hard coded magic
inode numbers.  That does really ugly things to the implementation
of /proc.
If instead of special case /proc/<pid>/ would it be ok if
this applied to any directory that is world readable and executable?
ie.
#define S_ISDIR_RXUGO(m) \
	(((m) & (S_IFMT|S_IRUGO|S_IXUGO)) == (S_IFDIR|S_IRUGO|S_IXUGO))
if (S_ISDIR_RXUGO(inode->i_mode) || task_dumpable(task)) {
	inode->i_uid = task->euid;
	inode->i_gid = task->egid;
} else {
	inode->i_uid = 0;
	inode->i_gid = 0;
}
