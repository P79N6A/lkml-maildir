For one thing, the C standard specifies that literals fit into signed 
before unsigned if they're not specified as unsigned in the first place. 
Shifting signed values (INT_MAX<<1) is wrong on some architectures and 
foolish on all. You would have to do "(unsigned int)INT_MAX << 1".

The C standard specifies that a numeric literal constant ending with "U" 
may be interpreted as unsigned int, unsigned long int, or unsigned long 
long int, in that order, choosing the first in which it will fit. So "~0U" 
is correct. If it's not working, I suggest you file a compiler bug/defect 
report.
