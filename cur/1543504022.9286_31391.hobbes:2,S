You don't need a Tandem to catch this. You just need to turn on the SCSI
parity. For some reason the majority of systems seem to have it turned off.
On some older systems parity didn't work properly, but I don't think that is
an issue today. Still, most systems I look at have parity turned off.
Stratuses die. Tandems die. They die less often, but the consequences are
worse. In my experience a Stratus will have more than one reboot a year, due
to various troubles. A just reboot takes over an hour, so one reboot per year
brings availability down to 99.99%. Tandems have a pretty slow restart too.
The place were Tandems seem to score well is data integrity - banks don't
loose many transactions through them, even when they do down.
