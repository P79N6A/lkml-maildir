That won't ever happen.  There are many ways of implementing
thumbnails, and people don't want to slow down the operation
of "mv" by having it search for _all_ the known thumbnails schemes.
(Yes - several may be in use simultaneosly because the user uses several
file managers!)  The waste of time is even more interesting for the many
directories that doesn't have thumbs at all.
A file-as-dir implementation of thumbnails avoids this particular
problem.  There are other uses, so I hope people won't see
file-as-dir as a mechanism for "file attributes" _only_.
