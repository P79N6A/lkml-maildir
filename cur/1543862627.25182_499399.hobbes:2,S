This is easy to fix in multiple ways. For example (this is not the best
approach), we can make cpu_creation_map. Like cpu_populate_map, but CPU
is cleared on CPU_DEAD/CPU_UP_CANCELED.
I'll continue when I have a time.

Deadlock if work_struct re-queues itself.

No, we can't move a currently executing work. This will break flush_workxxx().

Racy. Because of kthread_stop() above we should clear cwq->thread somehow.
But we can't do this: this workqueue may be already destroyed.

See above.
Please note that the code I posted does something like kthread_mark_stop(), but
it operates on cwq, not on task_struct, this makes a big difference. And it doesn't
need take_over_work() at all. And it doesn't need additional complications. Instead,
it lessens both the source and compiled code.
Note that I am not against using freezer for cpu-hotplug. My point is that this
can't help much for the current workqueue.c, and it will completely transparent
with the change I suggest.
Oleg.
