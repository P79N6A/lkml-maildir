It's not hard to check that out and find that it IS true. For many
years, the biggest complaint about the IBM PC and its clones was that
the system heartbeat was so slow, and people had to play tricks to get
a decent interval timer. That's also not hard to prove.
Incidentally, the reason for that 65536 ticks per hour was because of
the way IBM's programmers designed the system timer - one word to
count the number of ticks, and a second to count the number of hours
that had passed...
Best wishes from Riley.
