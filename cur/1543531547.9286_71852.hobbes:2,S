the PCMCIA-cs shows this card in /var/run/stab differently in this version
(last successful one that was tried was pre2-4).  The last field AFAIK
should be the device (ie: eth0).  But it shows it as the module name
instead.  /etc/pcmcia/network is unable to bring up the interface because
it doesn't know what interface to bring up.
