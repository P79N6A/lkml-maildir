DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support) now contains module build
kernel-preparation support for SLES/United Linux type kernels.  This allows
you to properly build modules for these kernels using DKMS.  Many thanks to
Fred Treasure - fwtreas () us ! ibm ! com for assisting in this.
Also, as SLES uses a different mkinitrd command then the one found in RH, if
REMAKE_INITRD is set in your dkms.conf, it does not remake the initrd for
you and instead tells you that you will have to do this manually.  If anyone
would like to send me feedback on best practices for SLES/UL initrd stuffs
so that this process can be automated, your help would be greatly
appreciated.
