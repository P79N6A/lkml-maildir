More tests conducted:
16MB memory, 32MB swapfile + 64MB swappartition (in that order)
16MB memory, 64MB swappartition + 32MB swapfile
16MB memory, 64MB swappartition
16MB memory, 32MB swapfile
16MB memory, NO swap
64MB memory, 256MB swappartition
64MB memory, NO swap
All survives just fine.
I can't do anything else while running the memory-eater program
(this is via ssh; haven't tried locally), but when it finally gets
killed, everything works ok again.
