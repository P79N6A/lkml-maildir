You can't take the disk away, but you can be careful with it.
The anticipatory scheduler already does that - avoids seeking
away from a read for a while just in case the reader will submit
an adjacent read in short order. (Wonder if it ought to read ahead
a little instead of just waiting?)
Something similiar could be done for io niceness.  If we run out of
normal priority io, how about not issuing the low priority io
right away.  Anticipate there will be more high-priority io
and wait for some idle time before letting low-priority
requests through.  And of course some maximum wait to prevent
total starvation.

Anticipatory io niceness might solve that.

There's no cure for truely stupid hw.  Sometimes I forget why I buy
these expensive scsi drives . . .
