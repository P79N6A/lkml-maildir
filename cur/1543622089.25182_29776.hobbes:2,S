Make sure you switched DMA off with hdparm -d0.
You must find corresponding /dev/hdX, hdparm does not work
on /dev/ht0. If is a known problem (Red Hat bug #54517).
BTW, if you have trouble with Red Hat kernels, you may find
better luck trying Red Hat support. What if I did not see
your message here?
