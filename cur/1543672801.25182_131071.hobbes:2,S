   What about this one: redefine it to (*ioctl)( ...., unsigned *long*,
   unsinged long). That means we can add 
   
   #define IOCTL_COMPAT 0x1 0000 0000
Bzzt!  Doesn't work on 32-bit.  COMPAT does not mean 64-bit-->32-bit
translations, stop thinking about the compat layer in this way.
It is a generic environment translation system.
Eventually we can use it for things like IBCS2 and stuff like that.
Suggest something sane like defining a macro such as
"compat_task(tsk)" that can be tested by various bits of
code.
