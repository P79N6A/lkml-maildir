Ok, I'll try to compile UML, most of the times it doesn't work out for
me, but having something that triggers more reliably would be useful.
Sometimes it has taken even over an hour with gcc.

freepgt series and everything that directly touches ia32 emulation
between rc2 and rc3. The problem is I have only my saved commit mails

No snapshots available either, whoever introduced the bug chose a bad
