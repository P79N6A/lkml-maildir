Alan,
I just jumped to 2.2.18pre12 from 2.2.17 final.  Something's broken with
mouse detection.  My mouse is a Logitech Serial Mousman on ttyS0, and has
been forever.  A ps/2 port is present on the motherboard, but not in
use.  At boot of 2.2.18pre12, kudzu announces that it's found a new PS2
mouse and do I want to install it, etc.  If I tell it not to change
anything, the system comes up.  However, the real mouse then misbehaves
badly, losing button-down events and being generally sluggish.
Rebooting with 2.2.17, there are no problems.
Steve
