Oh, no question.  But the fact that it mostly works when the box is
idle means the hard drive firmware is reasonably aggressive about
pushing data from the write cache out to the platters when it can.

It depends on the workload, obviously.  I thought I remember someone
on this thread talking about benchmark where they went from ~2000 to
~20 ops/sec once they added fsync().  I'm sure that was an extreme
benchmarking workload that isn't at all representative of real-life
usage, where you're usually do something else modifying the metadata
of many tiny files over and over again.  :-)
It's also the case that a home user's fileserver is generally
quiscent, which is probably why we aren't hearing lots of stories
about home NAS servers (which I bet probably don't enable write
barriers) trashing vast amounts of user data.....
