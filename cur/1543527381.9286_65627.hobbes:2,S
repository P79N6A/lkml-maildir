Subject: aic7xxx: undefined references w/o PCI in 2.3.47

With changes made to the aic7xxx driver in 2.3.47, the Adaptec aic7xxx
driver has undefined references when compiled without PCI support. 
The offending function is scsi_to_pci_dma_dir(), which is defined in
drivers/scsi/scsi.h, but only if CONFIG_PCI is set.  This breaks support
for those folks using the EISA Adaptec 274x and VESA 284x cards. 
Anyone want to look at it? I don't have time to mess with it right now,
but I'd be happy to test out any fixes.  The compile error messages are
below. I can supply a .config file upon request, but I think the
actual problem is quite straight-forward.
drivers/scsi/scsi.a(aic7xxx.o): In function `aic7xxx_done':
aic7xxx.o(.text+0x223d): undefined reference to `scsi_to_pci_dma_dir'
aic7xxx.o(.text+0x226d): undefined reference to `scsi_to_pci_dma_dir'
drivers/scsi/scsi.a(aic7xxx.o): In function `aic7xxx_buildscb':
aic7xxx.o(.text+0x141f0): undefined reference to `scsi_to_pci_dma_dir'
aic7xxx.o(.text+0x142b1): undefined reference to `scsi_to_pci_dma_dir'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
