Ok, I completely missed this point so far, thanks for the info.

What is the best way to treat the IRQ mask for TX interrupts?
I guess it should be roughly:
- off when we expect ->poll() to be called, i.e. after calling
  netif_rx_schedule() or returning after a partial rx from poll().
- off when there are no packets left in the TX queue
- on while RX interrupts are on and we're waiting for packets
  to be transmitted.

I won't be able to do that work, I'm neither a good writer nor a networking
person.
Do you think we should still merge a section like the text I wrote up, even
if it makes the text even less well structured? Should I maybe add it
somewhere else than the appendix?
