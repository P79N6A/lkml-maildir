isdn in raw 2.2.1 is functionally the same as in 2.1.131acx with
some (but not all known) bug fixes backported from the 
isdn4linux CVS repository. Thus, if 2.1.131 worked for you, 2.2.1 should
do it, too.  You always have the the opportunity to upgrade isdn to the
current isdn4linux CVS version (available via anonymous cvs as described
in the isdn4linux faq or by ftp from ftp.suse.com).
Be aware that in either case you should recompile your isdn4k-utils
against the new kernel header files.
