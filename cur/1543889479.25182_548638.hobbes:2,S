Hello.
I think bind mounts were discussed when shared subtree
( 
http://lwn.net/Articles/159092/
 ) was introduced.
For systems that allow users mount their CD/DVDs freely,
bind mounts are used and labeling files is a convenient way
to deny accessing somebody else's files.
But systems that don't allow users mount their CD/DVDs freely,
bind mounts needn't to be used and using pathnames is a convenient way
to deny accessing somebody else's files.
Pathname based access control/auditing system
works if the system doesn't use bind mounts.
However, there are distributions (e.g. Debian Etch)
that always use bind mounts. In such distributions,
pathname based access control/auditing system doesn't work.
This is not the fault of distributions nor
pathname based access control/auditing system.
It is possible to solve by passing vfsmount to VFS and LSM functions.
SELinux users are having a lot of trouble because pathnames in audit logs
are not always complete.
AppArmor users are having a lot of trouble because pathnames which
a process requested are ambiguous when bind mounts are used.
Being able to report pathnames that a process requested is not surprising
when considering user friendliness.
I beleive passing vfsmount makes both users happy.
Thanks.
