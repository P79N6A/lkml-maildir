First, those numbers pretend to be _unused_ stack space.
Well, UML tends to use more stack space than the rest of kernel. Apart it has 
a bit more layering (even if less than in the past), we must use libc's 
function too, and they're not written to be executed on an 8k stack.
We've reimplemented libc's printf() in terms of kernel sprintf() because it 
used 32K of stack.
