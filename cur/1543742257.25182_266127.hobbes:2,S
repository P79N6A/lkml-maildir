Patch is okay (but I rararely see this kind of failure in
wild). Please submit via akpm.
Anyway, the most common problem these days is that one of devices
vetoes the suspend. In such case code does the right thing, but
without any message to the user... and that is kind of confusing.
Patch printing "swsusp failed because device XXXX vetoed it" would be
very welcome.
