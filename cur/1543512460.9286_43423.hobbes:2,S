I am experiencing reproducible hard freezes on my 2.2.5 machine, stock
RedHat 6.0.  I can trigger freezes most of the time by clicking on the
bookmark button on Netscape.  I didn't have this problem until I upgraded
my old system (an AMD K6 200 / 32 megs ram) to a new one (AMD K6-3 450 /
64 megs / underclocked to 300 mhz because of the win95 bug currently /
Soyo mboard).  If the machine doesn't freeze when I click the bookmark
button it works perfectly for hours.  I suppose this could be an X
problem, but this is the same video card I used before i upgraded.
This is making my machine unusable -- any suggestions?  I'm including my
/proc/pci just so you know the basic hardware in the machine:
