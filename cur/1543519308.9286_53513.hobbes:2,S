No. my opinion was to locate only STOP/START management in the scheduling loop
in order to avoid exiting it for being managed very lately (just before
returning in user mode). So that if a process is stopped and then restarted
without any signal handler, then it will remain blocked in the scheduler
(which is transparent for functions that blocks a process).

My point is that processes that are stopped and restarted, exit from the
main schduler loop, and prepare themselves for returning EINTR in user space
(which is *not* POSIX-compliant, and make GDB very intrusive), since the
current implementation of restart does not force them to return to the
scheduler loop for those in INTERRUPTED state. The idea of managing stop
restart without signal handlers within schedule() is to make a simple
machine-independent modification to correct this signal mishandling.
Any scheduler guru opinion ???
