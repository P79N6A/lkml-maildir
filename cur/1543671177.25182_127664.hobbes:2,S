I'm not sure the best solution is to try to hack applications doing things
in the way they find best. I suspect that we have to change the kernel so
it handles the requests in a reasonable way.
Of course reasonable way may mean that bash does some things a bit slower,
but given that the whole thing works well in most cases anyway, I think
the kernel handling the situation is preferable.
