If you used a sane player this wouldn't happen.  Every few seconds
there will be a frame that takes a little longer than average to
decode, and unless the player can all the CPU time it wants, there
will be skips.  The solution is to buffer a few decoded frames
somewhere, preferably in video memory.  That will give you the extra
time to decode the difficult frames, and then catch up with some easy
ones.
If the scheduler can be tweaked so even mplayer does the right thing,
that's good.  It could solve other problems more difficult to address
in the application.
