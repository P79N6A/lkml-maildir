Perl / Microsoft / Java programmers are probably not worth their
weight in salt anyway :-)
I'm not an expert in any of the above platforms either, so don't know
if the semantics of "volatile" in those other languages are different
from that in C -- and this document clearly applies to only the kernel
(and thus C). But if this volatile == atomic disease is indeed common
among _C_ programmers too, then your suggested addition would make
sense.
