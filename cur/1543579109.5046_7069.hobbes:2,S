After making extensive enquiries elsewhere I have been advised to post
this question to the kernel mailing list. Joseph Anthony wrote recently
to the list about a similar matter (I think).
The problem: symptoms
It concerns the behaviour of Netscape after upgrading from kernel
2.2.16 to 2.4.0. With the new kernel Netscape locates and connects to
a URL, and sometimes begins to download, but then it just sits there
indefinitely (without downloading any data). This happens quite
consistently since I upgraded to 2.4.0 (about 2 weeks ago).  ppp,
telnet, ftp all function satisfactorily as far as I can determine
(however that's not to say that the problem doesn't originate with
ppp in the kernel). There are a few packet errors (about 1 per 1000).
Netscape continues to function well with Linux kernel 2.2.16 -- but
not with 2.4.0.
People have suggested various things (eg upgrading programs to later
versions). I have tried most of them, without success. Somebody
recommended I turn to the kernel mailing list. If this is not the
right place for my enquiry I apologize (where else?). But if somebody
recognizes these symptoms I would be very grateful for a diagnosis...
Thanks,
Roger Young
