Then store the value computed  by libmagic into an extended attribute,
if you  like. I still  don't see why  the kernel should even  care. It
shouldn't read things from files anyway, as a kernel shall be bootable
on a busybox  system (and *Step) as  well, so we don't rely  on the fs
layout in any way.

Quel horreur!
Do it in userland, really.
If I  get the time,  I'll write you  a small daemon based  on libmagic
which  stores  the  file  attributes  in xattrs,  or  if  they're  not
supported, in some MacOS/Xish per-directory files. Even a file manager
("finder") can do that, there's not even the need for a daemon.
