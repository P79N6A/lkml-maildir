Thanks, it works fine now. I've still got one issue with XFS (this: [1] may
be helpful) left, though I didn't manage yet to reproduce it under
2.6.0-test3 (though I've seen it with 2.6.0-test2, even with the above
patch applied), so I'll start bothering you when (if, hopefully) this
happens. Thanks again,

    (I reported this once or twice on linux-xfs, however unsuccessfully)
