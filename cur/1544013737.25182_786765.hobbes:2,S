But they could be.  Appearenly, there was a very long,
multi-year lull, where no leap-seconds were required.
Its not fully understood why, as they used to be common.
Maybe its the melting glaciers :-)
There *was* talk of eliminating them forever (so as to
avoid this kind of bug, which affects banks, satellites,
telecom equipment, etc.) but I guess they didn't do it.
