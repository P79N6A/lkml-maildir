Why do you think users should not be allowed to chmod their processes' 
/proc directories?  Isn't it similar to being able to chmod their home 
directories?  They own both objects, after all (both conceptually and as 
attributed in the filesystem).

I have to admit to not having done any real testing with those 
utilities.  My excuse is this isn't such a new feature, Openwall had 
something similar for at least four years now and GrSecurity contains 
yet another flavour of it.  Openwall also provides one patch for 
procps-2.0.6, so I figured that problem (whatever their patch is about) 
got fixed in later versions.
Why do ps and top need to be setuid root to deal with a resticted /proc? 
    What information in /proc/<pid> needs to be available to any and all 
users?

How about a boot parameter or sysctl to enable the chmod'ability of 
/proc/<pid>, defaulting to off?  But I'd like to resolve your more 
general objections above first, if possible. :)
Thanks for your comments,
Rene
