Base 0x400 should work just fine for Wine, we already need to have the
BIOS data mapped there anyway, so simply making the selector available
to user space would work completely transparently for us. We are
currently trapping and emulating accesses to that selector so it
doesn't matter much whether it is protected or not, except for a small
performance gain. What would break Wine is if that selector was made
accessible to user space with a different base address, so this should
be avoided.
