I'm afraid there is some misunderstanding here...
16 -> 32-bit code migration started before the bin86->GAS migration.
You can see it in 2.3.19 as well as in 2.3.21. 
I don't see any advantages of using the 32-bit code in bootsect.S.
So it was the reason of my first question:
   are there *any* advantages of using it there ?
