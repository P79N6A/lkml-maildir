cfag12864bcfb is a "fbdev" (actually, it is a "fb wrapper" for
cfag12864b, so it behaves like a framebuffer, although it is not an
usual framebuffer. f.e. it has asynchronous refresh rate, a mmaped
page to appear to be a fb...).
Still, it is not the front panel lcd of any specific device like PDA,
so people that expects only their primary video/ displays may be
confused if it appears at such section. So we decided to go away from
video/. Maybe we can change the description, as right now it only
refers to front panel lcds.
