My first thought is to run screaming for the hills when user's want this.
In a previous life we had a customer in the US Gov who decided to
put all their 700 million files in one directory. Then they had a
double disk unreported raid failure (raid vendors fault). The
filesystem repair ran for 7 days and a heck of a lot of files
ended up in lost+found. Fortunately they had the huge amount of
memory and process address space available to run repair.
Anyone who does this and has any sense does not allow any sort of
scanning of the namespace (i.e. anything using readdir). You tend
to run out of process address space before you have read the
directory.
You might want to think about keeping the directory a little
more contiguous than individual disk blocks. XFS does have
code in it to allocate the directory in chunks larger than
a single file system block. It does not get used on linux
because the code was written under the assumption you can
see the whole chunk as a single piece of memory which does not
work to well in the linux kernel.
