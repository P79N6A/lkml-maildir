Hi!
 While looking through the output of dmesg I found the following:
---
 Sound initialization started
 Interwave: Can't use all installed RAM.                      ***
 Interwave: Try reordering SIMMS.
 Interwave: Can't find working DRAM encoding.                 ***
 Interwave: Defaulting to 256k. Try reordering SIMMS.         ***
 <GUS PnP (IWave)> at 0x32c dma 7,6
 <Gravis UltraSound PnP (256k)> at 0x220 irq 15 dma 6,7
 Sound initialization complete

 The mysterious lines are marked. What does this mean? I have 8MB installed on
 my GUS. It seems that only 256K are used ?! What happens to the rest?
 cat /dev/sndstat produces:
