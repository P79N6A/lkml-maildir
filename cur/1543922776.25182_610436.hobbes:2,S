It is worth it.
Arjan's right that RLIMIT_DATA has difficulty making sense, but
you shouldn't be randomizing its breakage further with your patch.

I find the order in that test mysterious.  Others might ask you to use
an intermediate variable, I don't care about that, but I would find
if (rlim < RLIM_INFINITY &&
	(brk - mm->start_brk) + (mm->end_data - mm->start_data) > rlim)
much easier to understand.
