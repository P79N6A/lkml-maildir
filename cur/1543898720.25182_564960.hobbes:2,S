I totally agree with Christophe, this dependency is a complete
pain for trying to do util-linux-ng development.  I meant to
complain about this myself.

I second this sentiment as well.  It's not like we expect this stuff
to get used on other systems at all, and the only thing it's getting
used for really is to detect the awful external blkid/volume_id
dependencies.
I totally think this stuff can and should be completely eliminated.
