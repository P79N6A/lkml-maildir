well normally this is the job of the userspace IRQ balancer to get
right; the thing is undergoing a redesign right now to be smarter and
deal better with dual/quad core, numa etc etc, but as a principle thing
this is best done in userspace (simply because there's higher level
information there, like "is this interrupt for a network device", so
that policy can take that into account)
