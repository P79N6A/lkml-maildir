Linux would want it to come from the user address space because it has
no precedent for per-process addressing in the kernel address space,
and much simpler to keep it that way.

Which is more good reason to put user-address-space-specific-mappings
(page table mappings; the filepage mapping case is less obvious) in
the user address space (but of course not accessible to the user) -
probably above user stack, since that's already of indefinite size.
