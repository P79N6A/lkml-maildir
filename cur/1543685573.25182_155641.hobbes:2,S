Dynamically changing the symbol type isn't possible and usally not needed, 
if the driver can't be compiled as module, it has to use 'bool'. I'm 
planning to add tags (e.g. for EXPERIMENTAL), maybe in this context it 
will be easier, to better classify the brokenness of a driver, but this 
will definitively not happen for 2.6.
bye, Roman
