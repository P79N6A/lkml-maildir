It isn't defensive.  The local_irq_disable() is needed to avoid a race
condition.  It was added to fix high latency spikes.
(A comment to that effect in default_idle would be nice).
Without it, after checking need_resched, that flag can be set by an
interrupt before we do "hlt".
The result is a halted CPU even though need_resched is set, and the
idle loop isn't broken until the next interrupt, often a timer tick.
The "sti" in safe_halt() is immediately before the "hlt", which means
it doesn't enable interrupts until after the "hlt" instruction.  This
means that any interrupt will wake the CPU.
local_irq_disable() isn't required in the monitor/mwait loop, because
you check need_resched between the monitor and mwait.  (If Intel had
implemented monitor+mwait as a single instruction, then you'd need it).
So you can remove it from your loop.
Enjoy :)
