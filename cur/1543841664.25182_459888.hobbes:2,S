Dmitry's patch stopped the LEDs but gave VFS no root device error, make no 
sense to me so I start over...
Apply 2.6.18-rc5-mm1, then:
File: drivers-md-kconfig-fix-block-dependency.patch
File: provide-kernel_execve-on-all-architectures-fix-2.patch
File: provide-kernel_execve-on-all-architectures-fix-3.patch
File: revert-acpi-mwait-c-state-fixes.patch
File: revert-ide-hpa-resume-fix.patch
Falls over, looping, after a VFS no root message :(
Apply Dmitry's patch...
Okay, we're not doing the silly looping:
Error is same as previously reported.
A couple blank menu screens in other areas, make oldconfig doesn't :(
WTF happened to SATA support?  Where's it hiding now?  Found it...
Okay, boots --> Needs Dmitry's non-looping patch so errors don't scroll off 
screen.  Problem was SATA moved to new window and `make oldconfig` didn't ;)
Grant.
