Any place the kernel saves a pid and then proceeds to signal it later.
At that later point in time it is possibly you will be in the wrong
context.
This probably justifies having a kpid_t that has both the process
space id and the pid in it.  For when the kernel is storing pids to
use as weak references, for signal purposes etc.
At least tty_io.c and fcntl.c have examples where you the caller
may not have the proper context.

Simplified, and made easier to understand.  I don't know if the number
of lines affected can or should be reduced.  
One of my problems with your current approach is that it doesn't help
identify where you have problems.
I have found a specific example that your current patches get wrong,
because you make assumptions about which context is valid.

kernel_thread() is a light wrapper around do_fork().
do_fork returns a virtual pid.
find_task_by_pid takes a pid with the upper bits holding the process
   space id.
Therefore if this function or a cousin of it was ever triggered
by a userspace application in a virtual context find_task_by_pid
would fail to find the task structure.
The only way I know to make this change safely is to make compilation
of all functions that manipulate pids in possibly dangerous ways fail.
And then to manually and slowly fix them up.
That way if something is missed.  You get a compile error instead
of incorrect execution.
