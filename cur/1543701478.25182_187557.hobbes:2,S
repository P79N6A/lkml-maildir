Subject: [PATCH] [2.4.24-pre3] 0/5  EXT2/3 Updates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Marcelo,
I would appreciate it if you would consider applying these patches for
2.4.24:
Patch 1:  Fix VM overcommit accounting of truncated pages pinned by ext3
Patch 2:  Fix Compatibility problem with 2.6 SELinux users who try to
        boot 2.4 kernels (from sct)
Patch 3:  Add forward compatibility for on-line resizing
Patch 4:  Add forward compatibility for expanded inodes
Patch 5:  Add HTREE indexed directory support
Most of these patches have been tested for quite a while as independent
patches against 2.4, as well as in Linux 2.6.0.  Patches 2, 3, and 4 add
better forward compatibility for the EXT2 and EXT3 filesystems.  Patch
#5 is the largests, and adds the HTREE support.  This is a roll-up patch
that includes all of the various bugfixes that are in Linux 2.6.0.
(Note: There are some additional 2.4 ext2/3 patches including those for
the Orlov allocator, that are not included in this patch set; the ones
included here are the ones which I believe are most critical for
inclusion in the 2.4 mainline.)
                                                - Ted
