Does Windows(-users) really need anything more than ever-more advanced
graphics-adapters with ever-more buggy drivers and ever-faster CPU's,
both to support their ever-more advanced and mind numbing games.  Oh,
and ever-bigger hard disks to hold their ever-growing collections of
mp3's and movies that they probably don't even listen to/watch...
Yeeshh...
Some day maybe even manufactors of Intel hardware might start to create
intelligent, thought through hardware, but I seriously doubt it.
