printf prints to stdout.  fprintf prints to a file.  sprintf prints to
a string.  sb_printf prints to an sb.

An interesting belief.  Of the three users I've converted, one uses
GFP_ATOMIC and two use GFP_KERNEL.

If you look at the patches, you'll see that they basically all have a
wrapper around sb_printf that I was able to insert the GFP argument
into, so I don't see this as a win.  I hadn't bothered with one for
ISDN, and that one involved much more editing.
