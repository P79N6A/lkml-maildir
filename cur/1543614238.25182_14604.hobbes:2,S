Do it for 15 production systems, each with varying hardware.
Now do it again for kernel revision 2. Now again for rev 3. Now
again for rev 1 of 2.4.17...
OR
List the names of the modules for boot ONCE in the systems 'grub.conf'
file, and just create a 'current' symlink each time you install
a new kernel and modules. A simple user land util can parge depmod to
give you to right order...no bloat needed.
FYI I only ned create a 'vmlinuz' for new kernel install as it is.
If I could do the same for modules, I wouldn't have a 1.3MB
'catch all' bzImage.

Oh that's nice, clean, and standardized! Again do it for 15 machines...
Many of you people spouting about 'kernel design' really need to get
a clue about putting these things into real world practise, across
mutiple machines, that must stay running...
