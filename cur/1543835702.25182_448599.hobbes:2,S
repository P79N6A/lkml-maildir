Hi Ingo,
I thought that oringally and ran memtest on it for 8hrs. Not a long time I know, but there were no errors. If you reckon running it for 24hrs solid might display a memory problem I will try again.
This is my only machine running linux, so I dont have any identical hardware to test against.
Thanks,
Stephen

This might be single bit (memory) error leading to failed NULL checks.
e.g. 
if (pointer == NULL) 
   goto bail_out;
will fail.
Could you run memtest on this machine?
Did you see it on any other machine with identical hardware?
Did see it on any other machine at all?
Regards
Ingo Oeser
