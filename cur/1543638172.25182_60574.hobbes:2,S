Thank's Rudmer
Actually it is disabbled intentionally. The eth0 will install itself on 
the IRQ11 and I didn't find a way to get it somewhere else. IRQ11 is 
used by the SCSI Raid Controller already whic is fixed in the 66Mhz 
64Bit slot(and later on by another onbord AIC7xxx device which I am also 
unable to reroute up to now)
And even the eth1 is not working properly
