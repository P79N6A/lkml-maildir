Well, this would be ASCII codes 0 through 0x1f and 0x7f through 0x9f.
Unfortunately, some of the latter correspond to national letters and
other visible characters with weird charsets:

but perhaps it is OK to not support them in kernel logs - syslogd's
printline() would escape them anyway, so we can do it earlier to also
protect the console.
Would you escape backslashes themselves, though?  Perhaps not.  syslogd
(as maintained in Linux sysklogd) doesn't.  Yes, this escaping is not
reliably reversible in that case.

I agree.
