In my own defense, I didn't know whether it was upgrading to 2.3.x (I
topped out at 2.3.5 from the compile/oops on halt problems in 2.3.6,
and the corruption problems from there) that broke slocate or whether
it was a problem in slocate itself.  I only noticed the problem when
my system had 6 of them running and had a loadav of like 4.
I'll put the vfat (my windows C drive) back into the slocate config
and send the previously requested output later today.
