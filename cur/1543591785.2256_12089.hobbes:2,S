It still doesn't work.
That only makes people complain about my fascist tendencies. See the
thread about device numbers, where Alan just says "ok, I'll do it without
Linus then". 
The whole point of open source is that I don't have that kind of power. I
can only guide, but the most powerful guide is by guiding the _design_,
not micro-managing.

I know. David has zero taste. 
Davem, why didn't you just make new entries in /proc/bus/pci and let
people do "mmap(/proc/bus/pci/xxxx/mem)" instead of having idiotic ioctl's
to set "this is a IO handle" and "this is a MEM handle"? This particular
braindamage is not too late to fix..
