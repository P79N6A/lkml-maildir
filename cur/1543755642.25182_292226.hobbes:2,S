Why don't you just GPL your driver?  It's not like somebody will have
some innate commercial advantage over you because they have your
driver source code.  You might even have a commercial advantage by
participating with GPL drivers because the community will help adjust
them to in-kernel API changes too.  Besides, you'll get cross-platform
portability basically for free, as opposed to a binary-only driver for
x86 where you can't use it on PPC, Alpha, etc.  Please consider the
benefits to GPL software ;-)
