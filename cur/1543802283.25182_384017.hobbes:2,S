Open file descriptors have nothing to do with it. The device permissions are 
set by different pam modules on different distributions (pam_console, 
pam_resmgr).
Without acls, permissions are assigned by changing file ownership. With acls, 
the respective user or users can be given access as appropriate, which is 
more flexible. There are a few cases in which it is desirable to grant access 
to a device to more than one locally logged in user. This also obsoletes the 
resmgr hack of passing around open file descriptors and several hacks in 
applications that use this mechanism, because permissions can be set as 
appropriate.
