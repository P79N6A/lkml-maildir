Yes, I'm in two minds about this one.
Either we could provide a helper routine to do it and convert all the
internal uses over, or we could define a new ioctl that is correctly
unique, something like
#define SCSI_TEST_UNIT_READY	_IOR('S', 8, int)
or perhaps just 0x5388
and convert the internal users over to it.
Opinions?
