Just a new version, not a big difference.  The ondisk format changed a
little making it incompatible with the previous versions.  We'd been
holding out on the format change for a long time and thought now would be
a sensible time to finally do it.
This is also about timing things conveniently.  Each GFS version coincides
with a development cycle and we decided to wait for this version/cycle to
move code upstream.  So, we have new version, format change, and code
upstream all together, but it's still the same GFS to us.
As with _any_ new version (involving ondisk formats or not) we need to
thoroughly test everything to fix the inevitible bugs and regresssions
that are introduced, there's nothing new or surprising about that.
About the name -- we need to support customers running both versions for a
long time.  The "2" was added to make that process a little easier and
clearer for people, that's all.  If the 2 is really distressing we could
rip it off, but there seems to be as many file systems ending in digits
than not these days...
