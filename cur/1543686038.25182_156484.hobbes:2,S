I applied this patch:
http://bytesex.org/patches/2.6.0-test3/patch-2.6.0-test3-kraxel.gz
bttv run's fine, now.
I only got some small error-messages recently:
Aug 11 18:08:58 lfs kernel: bttv0: skipped frame. no signal? high irq latency?
Aug 11 18:10:57 lfs last message repeated 2 times
Most error messages I got before have gone and my tv-application
runs fine.
Thank you, for support, Gerd.
