As I *said* - "hairy beyond benefit", not "cant".

They do exist.
IBM mainframe disks (the 3330/50/80 series) are able to do much more than that
in one CCW chain  So it was *quite* possible to even express things like "Go to
this cylinder/track, search for each record that has value XYZ in the 'key'
field, and if found, write value ABC in the data field". (In fact, the DASD I/O
opcodes for CCW chains are Turing-complete).

The only operating system I'm aware of that actually uses that stuff is MVS.

My complaint was the confusion of "obviously cant" with "we have decided we
don't want to".
