It's a good point.  block_write_anon_page could be changed to just write the oldest buffer and redirty the page (if the buffers are far apart).  If memory is tight, and we *really* need the page back, it will be flushed by try_to_free_buffers.
It seems a bit nasty to me though...writepage should write the page.
