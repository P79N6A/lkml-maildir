remember that load is the sum of running/runable processes and processes
in D state (waiting for IO generally, but not always). I'm pretty sure
your load comes from one of the later...
ps ought to tell you which one it is... (if not, an 
"echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger" will dump the kernel state including the
offending process, and will also tell us where exactly that process is)
