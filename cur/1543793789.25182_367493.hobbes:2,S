Avoiding fallback as much as possible is something I would push into a
zone approach that can be developer separetly to this. I want to give hard
guarantees in special zones about fallbacks and best effort everywhere
else with this. Taking complex steps to avoid tough fallbacks here hurts
the general path on a typical machine.

Yes. If anything, it's the other way around one would be concerned about.
The anti-defrag approach just groups related allocations together as much
as possible. If the grouping is not possible without taking expensive
steps like balancing or reclaiming, it tries to steal the largest
possible block from the other list to reduce the chances that fallbacks
will occur in the near future.

It's at allocation time if you know whether fallbacks are needed or not.
To do something similar at free, you are entering the realm of watermarks,
balances and tunables. As it is, the usemap tells __free_pages_bulk() what
free list pages should be going back to.
