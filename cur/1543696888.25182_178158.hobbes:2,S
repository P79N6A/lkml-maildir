BTW, i did encounter some problem with amiga partitions which had some
bad values due to a bug in libparted now fixed. The head size was
counted double or something such, which resulted in accesses beyon the
end of the device. It has a funny effect though. The box would freeze,
and the IDE led would flash in 1 second intervals. Not sure it is the
expected behavior. This is with a 2.4.22 kernel, both on x86 and ppc.
