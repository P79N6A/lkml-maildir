One feature I found missing at the paravirt patches is to allow the
user to forbid the use of paravirtualization of certain features (via
a bitmask on the kernel commandline for example) so that the execution
drops into the native hardware virtualization system. Such a feature
would provide a big upwards compatibility for the kernel<->hypervisor
system. The case for this would be needing to forcefully upgrade the
hypervisor due to security issues and finding out that the hypervisor
is  incompatible at the paravirtualizatrion level, then the user would
be at least capable of continuing to run the old kernel with the new
hypervisor until the compatibility is reached again.
BTW, what is the recommended distro or kernel setup to help testing
the latest paravirt patches? I've got a spare machine (with no needed
data) at hand which could be put to good use.
