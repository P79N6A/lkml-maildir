But you'd be wrong. remap_file_pages was tested both with my own tester
and Ingo's test program.
vm_flags != 0, !vm_flags = 0, 0 & x = 0, so the test always falls
through. Of course, what I _should_ have done is also test a driver which
does not have VM_CAN_NONLINEAR... but even I wouldn't rewrite half
the nonlinear mapping code without once testing it ;)
FWIW, Oracle (maybe the sole real user of this) has been testing it, which
I'm very happy about (rather than testing after 2.6.23 is released).
