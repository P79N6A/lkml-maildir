    I hope so!
    That's *fascinating*;  your output looks like your machine is punting
    the memory region code altogether and falling back to E801.
    Can you hand-apply a cookie?   In arch/i386/kernel/setup.c, can you
    add a 
	    printk("e820:  E820_MAP_NR = %d\n", E820_MAP_NR);
    before the
	    if (E820_MAP_NR > 1) 
    line in setup_memory_region  (I'm sorry; I'd give you a patch except
    I put a K7 into my build machine and it promptly killed the disk :-()
    and tell me what it says?

     Are you getting any e820: messages?
