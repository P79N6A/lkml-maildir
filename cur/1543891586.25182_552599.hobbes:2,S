I'm not very keen on this whole idea. It's a fairly well-known
phenomenon that behavior can change for the worse when you turn off
debug flags for a variety of reasons. So instituting a monoculture
where -everyone- has a global debug flag on then turns it off is a little
worrisome.
When we're talking about a single warning, it's probably not a big
deal, but once we expand the usage to cover a dozen or a hundred
things, the odds that we'll hide a race or side-effect somewhere
increase.
