If you have another Linux box on the LAN, please set up netconsole
(Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt) to gather the boot logs.
When the machine has stalled, see if you can get a task trace with
ALT-SYSRQ-t.  This will require CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y and possibly setting
ignore_loglevel on the kernel boot command line.
Thanks.
(mad guesses: try the following on the boot command line: clock=pit,
noacpi, noapic)
