Several other things have been tried.
(a) something mingo wrote I forgot the nature of
(b) a thing manfred wrote that recovers positions in hashtable
	collision chains by sorting them, with O(chain length)
	insertion
(c) a thing I wrote that turns the tasklist and pid_chains into
	rbtrees and uses the last-seen pid to seek in O(lg(n))
	time, and uses a routine to seek and fill buffers as a
	drop-in replacement for get_tgid_list()/get_tid_list().
I have a current implementation of (c), as well as a patch to
restore 2.4 semantics to proc_pid_statm() in O(1) time.
