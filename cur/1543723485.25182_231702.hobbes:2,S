Except that c is not "part of the source string". The code "c =
*name" (where name starts off pointing to the same place as p->comm) is
executed once and only once per time through the loop. Then it does "*buf =
c". Your change would protect not against a change in "name" (which is
possible), but against a change in "buf" while we're writing to it
(impossible, as long as I'm understanding the proc code correctly).
Not that there is no race here, but that doesn't fix it. What's needed is
either another strcpy or locking around p->comm as suggested by Andrew
Morton.
