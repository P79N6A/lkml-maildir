no, active_balance is a different case, not covered by the all_pinned 
logic. This is a HT-special scenario, where busiest->nr_running == 1, 
and we have to do active load-balancing. This does not go through 
move_tasks() and does not set all_pinned. (If nr_running werent 1 we'd 
not have to kick active load-balancing.)
