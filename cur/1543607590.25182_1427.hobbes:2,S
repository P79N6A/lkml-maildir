Hi,
I have a program that will read a device. However, instead of stopping
on error, it will "note the error for later use", and continue.
When I do this on SCSI or IDE disks, the program will get EOF at the
end of the disk, and it can take appropriate action. However, when
run against a SCSI cdrom, it will continue going untill it fills 
all my disk space. 
This happened on our fileserver, which is currently running 2.4.13,
but it might have been running 2.4.10 at the time that this happened.
(Uptime tells me the machine has been rebooted in the meantime). 
				Roger.
