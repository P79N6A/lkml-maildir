Sorry,
I compiled from a user account and `/usr/bin' was before
`/usr/local/bin' on my path.  I had actually installed the tools as
per Documentation/Changes, honest! I was compiling with the
pgcc-2.91.66 and not egcs-2.91.66.  The root account was set up to use
egcs-2.91.66.
Why don't the build scripts run a dummy file to determine where the 
floating point registers should be placed?
...
const int value = offsetof(struct task_struct, thread.i387.fxsave) & 15;
...
VAL = objdump --all-headers foo.o | grep value | cut -c 48-57
PAD_SIZE = objdump --start-address=$VAL --disassemble-all foo.o | cut...
Or perhaps some better method for determining the offset on the host,
Compiling and execute won't work in cross development mode...
int main(){return offsetof(struct task_struct, thread.i387.fxsave) & 15;}
Perhaps this is a bit much to demand, instead of having a specific
compiler.
fwiw,
Bill Pringlemeir.
