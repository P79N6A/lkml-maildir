Hello,
Here is a series of patches to add knowledge about the axes of various
HP laptops supported by lis3lv02d/hp_accel, received from owners of
those laptops. The laptops are already detected, but these patches allow
to standardize the reported data with the physical movement of the laptop.
These are safe patches, allowing better hardware support, so it would be
great if they were accepted for 2.6.29 :-)
See you,
Eric
