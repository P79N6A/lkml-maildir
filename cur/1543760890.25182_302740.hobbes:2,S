Hi Pavel, 
This is similar to the Sempron patch I put out a while ago -
that was a similar problem. Let Mark and I think about it for
a couple of days. I think there is a better way to fix this.
There are some new fields in the status register in newer
parts to give things like maxvid, and we are not using them
at present. They were added in a manner compatible with the
older parts. I think we may have a better solution to use
the new fields.
Paul.
