ipc/sem.c. The change that now semaphores are actively given to the 
waiting task broke your test.
What happens is:
child 3 does a semaphore operation. It succeeds. update_queue is called:
- try_atomic_semop checks if it can wake up child 2. Answer: No.
- try_atomic_semop(): kernel checks if it can wake up child 1. Answer: Yes.
Bug: It must now check again if there is a thread that is waiting for 
semaphore value==0. This check is now missing. In 2.4, there was another 
round of update_queue calls just before child 1 returns to user space. 
That call then wakes up child 1. This call was removed.
One approach to fix that is a loop in update_queue: If a 
try_atomic_semop call from within update_queue modified the array, then 
check again from the beginning of the queue.
What do you think? I'll write a patch.
