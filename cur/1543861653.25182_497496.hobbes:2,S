I used 2.6.20-rc4 in single user mode, and applied 2 patches from
netdev to get wake on LAN support. This way I was able to set up an
automatic suspend/resume loop. It looked good, but after e.g. 20
minutes, the resume hang. So it is reproduceable with 2.6.20-rc4.
Unfortunately, I can not test the same with 2.6.18, as the wake on LAN
patches need 2.6.20-rc.
