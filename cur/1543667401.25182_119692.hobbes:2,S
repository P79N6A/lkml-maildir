This gets weirder by the minute, and I still can't get it to happen here
annoyingly.  
The list thats breaking is a private list. We delete the drive from that
list, if its present (it may be an empty bay) we then use ata_attach 
to add it to a device list (or back to ata_unused). 
I find it hard to believe something like this is a compiler bug, but right
now I don't see how stuff is reappearing on the list.
