i think the yield() is bogus - all of coredumping is (or ought to be) 
fully event-driven. I agree that coredumping itself does not need to run 
with RT priorities - but this does not change the fact that no kernel 
code should break if executing with RT priority.
In my tree i removed one yield() from exec.c and changed the other one 
to msleep(1).
