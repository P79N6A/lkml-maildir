So it looks like this is a real issue, and it's been tracked down to somewhere
between 2.2.20pre3 and 2.2.20pre5.
Unfortunately, I need to use zImage on my Tecra.  I know that zImage is
old, and I've heard that support for it will eventually be withdrawn, but I
don't really have much alternative right now unless there is a patch which
works around the Tecra's buggy A20 handling.
Does anyone know the status of zImage format in modern kernels?
Is it _supposed_ to be supported under 2.2.recent?  How about 2.4.recent?
I guess that, if zImage is supposed to be supported, then I have a genuine
bug.  However, if zImage support has officially been dropped, then it's a 
different
matter - in this case, the only bug would be that the Makefile should issue a
sensible message when you try to "make zImage" rather than producing a kernel
that won't work.
