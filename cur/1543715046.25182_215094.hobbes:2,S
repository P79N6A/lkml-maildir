Note that there are several kinds of x86-64 codes: the original one
and Joe's rewritten version in recent kernels. I don't know where
you heard it is broken, but maybe they were describing the older
code.
If they were refering to the recent version I assume they 
would have reported it to the maintainer. But they didn't ...
Anyways - i guess it's hard to make such a decision on hearsay.  I
would suggest you start with the x86-64 version and when there are
really problems you tell us about them and we fix them.
BTW there was a merged version from some PA-RISC person (with yet
another rewritten siginfo copy function) discussed, but for some
reason he dropped the ball.
