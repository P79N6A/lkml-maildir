| The problem is there's two jumps in the kernel. Intel's manual only asks

| Right, I also think removing the flush code is risky. Thanks very much, 
| chapter 18 is what i was looking for. I recalled in an old intel 
| booklet, named like something 386 system guide, says JMP after PG as 
| well as PE. But I didn't have that book at hand and didn't find any e-doc.
I guess that's the 80386 System Software Writer's Guide.
Ch. 6: Initialization.
Yes, it does JMP after setting PE and after enabling PG.
Any JMP.
| However, in 18.27.3, "The sequence bounded by the MOV and JMP 
| instructions should be identity" implies no JMP is also viable 
| practically. But we needn't to be that pedantic.
| 
| If no any reason for the two jumps, the code should be fixed to remains 
| only ONE near jump.
