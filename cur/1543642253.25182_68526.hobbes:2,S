Well Jeff will need to verify, but iirc many of those boxes he build and
sold power "amazon.com".  I got a charge knowing that factoid, when
everyone was slamming the reliablity and strenghts of ATA servers.
Also there were select systems that may have been VIA but they were hand
picked boards.
Anyways, Jeff will need to comment on this part.  However I know he has
shipped with 4 and maybe even 5 cards in a box that ran fine and stable.
Cheers,
