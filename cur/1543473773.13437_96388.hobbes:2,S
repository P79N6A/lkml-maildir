When you modify the data in /proc/bus/pci/*/*, any
changes do not get reflected in /proc/bus/pci/drivers.
Is this because:
1) It was felt to be unnessesary
2) It was forgotten about
3) It will get fixed later
4) You're not supposed to be able to change that
I noticed this while reconfiguring the IRQ of a
PCI card after bootup. This is related to below.
===================================================
When my video card (RIVA128) and Tulip DE-500AA
are given the same IRQ by my PCI BIOS (i.e. all
the time), starting X causes the whole box to
hang solid, no ping, no keyboard response.
But only if the tulip driver is loaded, either
tulip.c or de4x5.c. Win95 seems to handle it
OK. It may be X's fault, but I don't have the source.
This is 2.1.131-ac8. I havn't had the courage to
test with 2.2-pre2 yet, so it may be fixed already.
Loading the driver while X is running works fine,
even switching back to text mode...
I currently fix this by relocating the Tulip's IRQ at bootup.
Any ideas?
===================================================
BTW, i notice that syncing seems to ensure data
integrity, but the block bitmaps are always wrong.
