> New SCSI driver for 53c700 chip
Good!
If I am not mistaken, Richard Hirst has also done work on this thing.
The Panther/lp486e/PWS/... has on-board ethernet (82596)
and this now works under both 2.2 and 2.4.
It also has on-board SCSI (NCR 53c700-66), maybe memory mapped,
I forget. Maybe nobody knows the addresses.
It would be somewhat interesting to get that thing to work as well.
