it is being used for multiple purposes: measuring on-CPU time, measuring
on-runqueue time (for interactivity) and measuring off-runqueue time
(for interactivity). It is also used to measure cache-hotness, by the 
balancing code.
now, this particular update of p->timestamp:

is important for the interactivity code that runs in schedule() - it
wants to know how much time we spent on the runqueue without having run.
but you are right that the task_hot() use of p->timestamp is incorrect
for freshly woken up tasks - we want the balancer to be able to re-route
tasks to another CPU, as long as the task has not hit the runqueue yet
(which it hasnt where we consider it in the balancer).
the clean solution is to separate the multiple uses of p->timestamp:
with the patch below p->timestamp is purely used for the interactivity
code, and p->last_ran is for the rebalancer. The patch is ontop of your
task_hot() fix-patch. Does this work for your workload?
