Well, the disagreement in definition of "being used". Quite often you
have a device "open" for extended period of time (inactive ext2
partition is mounted on a disk) but device is not really active. You
could power it down and only wake up when there is a read or write
request.
It looks like "open" and "close" are terms better suited for class
devices while power management is applied to the "real" devices.
