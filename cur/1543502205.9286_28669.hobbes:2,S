If an architecture doesn't report a cross-platform feature, there is a bug.
I would expect to find out:
Is there any floating point hardware?
How many processors are there?
What is the BogoMIPS value?
These should also be provided if possible:
What is the clock speed? (rough estimate) (min, max, & current?)
What company designed or produced the CPU?
What is the CPU name? ("Pentium MMX")
What is the version number? (5.4.3 for the Pentium MMX above)
Even the architecture-specific values should be in a common format.
I ought to be able to write a nice GUI tool that displays a table
of all the features, bugs, and interesting numbers. That would use
a nice proportional font of course, so there would need to be a
cross-platform way to tell labels apart from values. (else how can
you align the columns right?)
Let's say I wrote software that would use MMX on ia32, AltiVec
instructions on PowerPC, and VIS on the SPARC. I want to test for the
appropriate feature at runtime. How? Must I write several parsers?
I would want to collect my data with one cross-platform parser.
Then I could just query for a "VIS" boolean.
