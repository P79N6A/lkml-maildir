Ingo,
Our testing with that drive (same firmware, using same aic7902 chipset) has
not shown any problems like this.  However, we were using a later aic79xx
driver versions (1.3.x).  That upgrade should be the first step.
I wouldn't get too excited about the statement by a level-1 Seagate support
guy, probably just a blanket statement when they want to disclaim
responsibility.  
Andy

Could we add a KERN_WARNING printk in sd.c quoting/referencing
this message on inquiry detecting this device? 
So sysadmins who are used to SCSI being robust could return the
drive to their vendors in exchange to a drive working along the
SCSI specs after reading this message.
Thanks in the name of the sysadmins.
