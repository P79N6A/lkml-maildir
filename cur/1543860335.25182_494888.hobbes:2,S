ok, your patch seems to fix the testcase here too on -rc2-rt.
[ Damn, i should have slept a bit more, that would have saved me a ~4
  hour debug and tracing session today to analyze your testcase, just to
  find your patch and your explanation on lkml, right after i sent my
  analysis and workaround patch ;-) At least now we know it from two
  independent tracing results that the suspect code is the same. ]
