What annoys me is that we've known about the problem for _ages_. If you look
the 2.4 kernel has experimental workarounds for this problem. VIA never once
even returned an email to say 'we are looking into this'. Instead people sat
there flashing multiple BIOS images and seeing what made the difference.

Disabling pci master read caching is likely to reduce the performance of the 
board.

The -ac kernel does this on the KT7 series boards which seemed the worst
affected. 
Hopefully now someone in VIA will have the decency to tell the community 
how to detect setups that need a BIOS upgrade so we can warn them before the
chipset bug turns there file systems into sludge.
