Whether this is desirable or not is debatable.  The big question is:  why on
earth would Aunt Tillie _want_ to compile a kernel at all, let alone
re-configure one?  If she's using Linux, she's installing her distribution's
pre-compiled kernel, and has no need for anything else.
Simplifying the configuration interface so that "anyone" can use it seems like
a waste of effort.  If there's an interested novice out there who wants to
learn how to configure a kernel, they'll be sufficiently interested to invest
an hour or two in learning how the whole process works.  Make it as simple as
it needs to be, and no simpler.
