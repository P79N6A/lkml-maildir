Andre,
	I just now discovered from 
http://www.viaarena.com/?PageID=70
that:
KM133 => VT8365 northbridge _always_
KL133 => VT8361 northbridge _OR_ VT8364 northbridge
Now (from kernel 2.4.18) linux-2.4.18/arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c has these
comment lines:
  * VIA 8363,8622,8361 Northbridges: 
  * - bits 5, 6, 7 at offset 0x55 need to be turned off 
It appears that ur patch doesnot affect chipsets with VT8361 northbridge.
Basically, ur patch is applicable for all KM133 (VT8365) chipsets.
But should it apply only to those KL133 chipsets with VT8364
northbridge or to KL133 chipsets with VT8361 northbridge too ?
So, besides the issue of renaming two macros, this patch needs to decide
which (or all) of the two types of KL133 chipsets is to be targeted.
thanks
- Nil
