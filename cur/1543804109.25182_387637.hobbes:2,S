Other than searches, there appear to be quite a number of drivers an
subsystems that like to print out pids.  I can't find any cases yet
where these are integral to functionality, but I wonder what approach we
should take.  Should we deprecate printk'ing of pids?  Make a special
function or % modifier to turn a task_struct into something printable?
A function would run into issues of having buffers in which to print the
output.  But, we'd be able to do things like:
	sprintf(buffer, "%d:%d", tsk->container, tsk->pid);
