Simple answer:
Bugreports in specific patchsets / kernel trees should first be sent to the
respective maintainer (mailing list, real person, distributor, whatever) and
then be "filtered" by that person into the consolidated "vanilla" bugzilla.
Anything else is madness. (Anything else also won't fit into the support
models of RH, SuSE, UL ...)
