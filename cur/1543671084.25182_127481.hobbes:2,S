That's what I thought, which is why I suspected that the underlying problem 
might be related to the scope and completeness of the hardware arbitration.  
Specifically, if a PCI board is DMA'ing a block of data to main memory, how 
is the operation of the direct-connect IDE device impacted?  When most PCI 
devices transfer data to main memory, don't they arbitrate the bus, become 
master, and blast it accross in chunks?  Doesn't onboard IDE (legacy?) use 
the DMA controller (8237 derivate I gues) to transfer?
