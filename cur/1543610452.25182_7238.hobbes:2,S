That's wrong. Either name the directory "linux" instead of "linux-2.4.14" 
(if you prefer, just create a symlink) or you have to do:
  cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.14
  zcat ../patch-2.4.15-pre9.gz | patch -p1
I would advise you against patching the original files; instead do 
something like this:
  cd /usr/src
  cp -al linux-2.4.14 linux-2.4.15-pre9
  cd linux-2.4.15-pre9
  zcat ../patch-2.4.15-pre9.gz | patch -p1
