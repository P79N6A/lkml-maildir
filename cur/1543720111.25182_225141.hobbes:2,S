I never used USB devices under Linux, and barely used them
at all. But couple of days ago a friend of mine gave
me almost for free a mobo with fried PS2 mouse and
keyboard ports.
I bought 2xPS2 -> USB converter, compiled in USB
and USB HID support in 2.6.7-rc1-bk2 and you know what?
It works! Both keyboard and mouse! Even in X!
Mega thanks to Greg KH <greg@kroah.com> and other USB
and hotplug folks!
