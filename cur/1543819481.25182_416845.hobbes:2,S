Hmmm..can't say that SELinux has been accused of being a "traditional
trusted OS architecture" before.  Flask and TE aren't precisely
traditional.  But it does preserve the key characteristics required to
support real MAC.

This would be fine, if the technical approach were sound (not
necessarily the same as SELinux, but sound) and fit properly with the
LSM interface.  But the path-based approach isn't technically sound, and
even if we were to assume that it was, it isn't even a good fit for the
LSM hook interfaces.
