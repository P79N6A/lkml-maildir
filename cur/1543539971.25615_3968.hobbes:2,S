Note that the Via KX133 and KT133 chipsets are specced to work with 3
PC100 DIMMs but only 2 PC133 DIMMs.  You're most likely running the ragged
edge of signal stability with 3 PC133 modules, if that's what you're using.
As a test, go into the BIOS setup, adjust the memory to run at 100MHz only,
install the 3 256MB modules, and try again.  If the kernel doesn't panic,
that's probably your reason.
