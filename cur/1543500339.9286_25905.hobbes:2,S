I had recently posted the "interceptors" patch for 2.3.8
In the curent version (0.3) you can intercept:
     - character devices,
     - block devices (file operations only, sorry),
     - system calls.
You can safely intercept the 'write' system call and filter it.
Is it what you need?
What other typer of interceptors do you need first of all?
               Best regards.
                    Alexander.
