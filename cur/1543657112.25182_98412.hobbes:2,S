Indeed, *every* compiler that supports flexible array members
does it this way.  On the gcc lists we've conjectured that this
will wind up being a Defect Report, and so have elected not to
change anything for the nonce.
That said, you should also note that "struct S foo[0]" is *not*
a flexible array member; "struct S foo[]" is.  The former is
gcc's zero-length array extension.  There are subtle differences
between the two features.  See the gcc docs for details.
