Susan,
I have not tried a low level format (by which I assume you mean the
SCSI command FORMAT UNIT). One thing to look out for would be the
default 60 second timeout. From your error message from the sense
buffer that doesn't seem to be your problem. Typically the SCSI
command you execute after closing the door on the removable media
will get the "not ready to ready transition" error. The usual
response is to try it again. But if this was the case it should be
reported pretty well immediately.
If there is a timeout after 60 seconds then I would expect the
'host_status' to be set to DID_TIME_OUT (0x03). Could it be 
possible a timeout occurred and the sense_buffer already had
that data in it from an earlier command?
The default timeout can be elongated by the SG_SET_TIMEOUT
ioctl.
