What my changed via-diag tries to do is to tell the chip to reload things

You can always try writing all the registers with "good" values.

You find the reset "thing". Maybe there is better documentation somewhere.
Maybe your bios allows you to reset something on reboots.
The pdf document has a few things that you can play with, SRST, INIT,
