I am partially responsible for the regression. While working on the
CPU accounting change, I for some unknown reason always assumed
that sched_clock() was virtualized. I should have taken a closer look.
Ingo, with this new approach, sched_clock() although not virtualized,
advances as if it is (due to the idle state change accounting).
I have one question though, what if the underlying CPU is forcefully
scheduled out from the virtual CPU?
