Is there any way to reproduce this? I turned on spinlock and
sleep-spinlock debugging and did lots of I/O but I don't see it.

Well bdi_write_congested() is racy, ofcourse, so in theory a call
to make_request() could be made which can block (and for dm, locks
the same semaphore) - so this can happen anyway. Only the chance of
it is much lower. I'm not sure how bad it is.
Changing down_read() in dm_any_congested to down_read_trylock() would
probably fix it for bdi_*_congested(). If you can tell me how to
reproduce it I can try a few things..
Mike.
