Can also do:
$ strings /lib/libc.so.5|grep Linux
@(#) The Linux C library 5.4.33
$ 
BTW, people have a nasty habit of tacking their entire .config file
onto bug reports to linux-kernel.  Can you mention "grep ^C .config"
somewhere in there (or have the script do it) since the number of
config options isn't going to decrease anytime soon...
