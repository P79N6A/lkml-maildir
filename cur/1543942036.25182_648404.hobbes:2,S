No, you know very well what I mean.
By the same logic you're preaching to include your
solution part of the kernel, you can also apply to
SCST.

Enclosure management isn't as simple as you're
portraying it here.  The enclosure management
device speaks either SES or SAF-TE.  The transport
protocol to access it could be SGPIO or I2C or...

I see.  You've just discovered SGPIO -- good for you.
At any rate, I told you already that what is needed
is not what you've provided but a _device node_
exported by the kernel, either a processor or
enclosure type.

You're jumping over layers here.
And that's not what's needed.  What is needed
is an instrumentation by the kernel to present the
enclosure device as a device node to user space
so that general utilities tools, like for example
sg_ses(8) can work with it.
Your solution seems to be interpreting SES in the
kernel and this is really unwieldy. 
Just provide the device node to user space.
You shouldn't have to interpret SES in the kernel
as you're currently doing since the kernel itself
has no use of it.

Vendors prefer to abstract the transport protocol
in HW/FW so that to ULD the device is of
type processor or enclosure.
This makes it easy for the vendor (in terms of
support) and for the customer (in terms of
usability).

You should separate "what it talks" by "how it
gets there".

No.  My idea is to provide a device node of
type processor or enclosure for each enclosure.
Expanders already do this by providing a virtual
phy which is "connected" to the SES-2 device, so
a device of type SES is discovered and registered
with the kernel as any other device on the domain.
Then the enclosure can be controlled via sg_ses(8)
from user space.
Host adapters already do this in their FW, since
it is there where they do the transport protocol
abstraction as well.
You can help AHCI (if this really is needed of
course) to achieve the same thing by providing
code so that a LLDD/etc can register a
processor/enclosure device accessible via the
ASIC.  At any rate the actual protocol to talk
to the enclosure device is abstracted away by
the HW solution (either in FW or HW).
At this moment I see all this effort in vain
for reasons I've described above.

I know -- this is why and where I responded to your
patches.
So I guess by what you just said, we're back
at square one? ... is this really needed, who is the
intended user/audience... why not just a device
node to be controlled via sg_ses(8) from user
space, as is already done for other enclosure
devices... etc.
