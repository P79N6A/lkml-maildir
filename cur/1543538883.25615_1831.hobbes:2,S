Hi All,
	I downloaded and compiled 2.4.0-test3 and parched it to -test4-pre6. It
compiled fine on my Athlon/SD11 system, but after booting I find that
every single thing compiled as a module had dependency errors. Here are
some (if not all) of the missing functions:
_max_memcopy
irq_stat
__generic_copy_from_user
__generic_copy_to_user
__const_udelay
enable_irq
disable_irq
kernel_thread
mmx_thread
I might have missed a few, but I hope you get it. Tried the pristine
source too just in case I had hosed the patch. Same story. Even tried
compiling for 586. Ditto. 
The good news was that the monolithic drivers worked really well,
although something must have changed significantly in /proc such that
gkrellm was not reporting any cpu usage.
For now I'm back to 2.2.16.
