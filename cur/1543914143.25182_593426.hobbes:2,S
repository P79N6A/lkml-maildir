Hi Ingo,
When compiling, I get:
In file included from kernel/sched.c:794:
kernel/sched_fair.c: In function 'task_new_fair':
kernel/sched_fair.c:857: error: 'sysctl_sched_child_runs_first'
undeclared (first use in this function)
kernel/sched_fair.c:857: error: (Each undeclared identifier is
reported only once
kernel/sched_fair.c:857: error: for each function it appears in.)
Presumably because sched_fair.c is being included into sched.c before
sysctl_sched_child_runs_first is defined.
Regards,
Rob
