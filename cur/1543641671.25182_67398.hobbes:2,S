This 2^32 jump is consistent with the jumps I saw.
I was discussing this issue with Richard Moore (IBM) a couple of weeks
ago and he mentionned that they had seen a similar problem with OS/2.
In that case, the problems were due to the time it took to read some
timer register. In other words, there may be a short time-window where
the values available are valid and nothing is garanteed if we exceed this
time-window. (This is second hand and I may have misunderstood a couple
of details, so I attached Richard so he can confirm/deny what I'm saying
here.)
Linux reads the PIT (8253) every 10ms on a PC, so the question is:
anyone know about 8253 reading deadlines ?
