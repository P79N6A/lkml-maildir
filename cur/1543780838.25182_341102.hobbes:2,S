Hello!
Today my gateway crashed.
I wrote down crash info on a paper.
It's not complete since only last 25 lines were shown,
but complete stackdump is here (I omitted hexadecimal values).

Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
Before the call trace there was some 64-bit values.
The box is dual Opteron with 2G RAM, with 64-bit kernel and mixed userland.
There are 2 tg3 interfaces (on-board), 3 e1000 ones, and 2 e100's in it.
After reboot, I disabled TSO (on e1000 NICs)  via ethtool.
