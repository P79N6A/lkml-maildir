Of course not.  Here's one line of bash that gets you the major:minor
file of every block device in the system:
	block_devices="$(echo /sys/block/*/dev /sys/block/*/*/dev)"
The block devices are all in a specific location.
And here's a way to get the cdroms of the system:
	media="$(echo /sys/block/*/device/media)"
	for i in $media; do
		type="$(cat $i)"
		if [ "${type}" == "cdrom" ]
		then
			# we have a cdrom here, at $media block device
		fi
	done
If you want to do this in C, there is a libsysfs, which should help you
out a bit on intregrating sysfs support into your program (although udev
has recently ripped it out and replaced it with 200 lines of code that
is way smaller and much faster...)
Hope this helps,
