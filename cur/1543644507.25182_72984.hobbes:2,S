Horribly unextensive.

Far better to send the whole patch.  If anybody should be sending
incremental patches, it's me to you.
I have a number of code reading projects going at the moment, DAC960
is one of them.  Rather than read the whole think I'll just start
with your bio changes, because it's fairly central and also fairly
focussed, plus I need the incentive to go in and figure out just what
Jens, Suparna et al have done in there.
