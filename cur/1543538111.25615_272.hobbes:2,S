Subject: [patch] autofs4 in 2.4.0 doesn't expire
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The expiration in autofs v4 of the 2.4.0 kernels doesn't seem to work.
I'm using kernel 2.4.0-test3-pre2 with autofs4 and autofs-4.0.0pre7.
After turning on debugging output, I found out that expiration doesn't
work because is_tree_busy() always returns 1, even if the filesystem
is not in use. I suspect that the busy count calculation is incorrect.
The patch below changes this, so that both single mounts, and tree
mounts will now unmount correctly. However, there is still a problem
with a local mount: the symlink that is created instead of the NFS
mount is not expired.
