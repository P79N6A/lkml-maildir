	Audit fixes: a bunch of bug fixes from Amy + overhead reduction for
case when no rules are loaded (lazy-audit) from me.  The latter speeds
"audit enabled, no rules present" to the level of "audit disabled".  The
current tree has about 15--20% overhead for that case on loads like "do a lot
of access(2)"; that gets killed by these patches.
