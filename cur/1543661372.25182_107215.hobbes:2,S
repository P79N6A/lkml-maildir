Of course I want to have a 64bit userland. In fact I have one.
Just we offer the users the choice to boot 32bit distributions with
64bit kernels too, in case they only need a single application
that needs 64bit or similar. I'm also prepared to rip out or ignore
very obscure parts of the 32bit emulation (in fact I did that already),
but if it's used commonly or even called in bootup it should be supported.
Short term I will just settle on getting that message away so that
RedHat users won't bother me anymore. Can you suggest a good way to 
handle SIOCGIWNAME? Should I just make it return -EINVAL?

I understand why you don't see much point to run 32bit on Itanium
because of the performance.  But that's not a problem on all 64bit ports...
