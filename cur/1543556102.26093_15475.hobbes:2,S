yet another apm related bug.  this one is the odd one, frequently i
update my kernel on this laptop.  every once in a while, i'd say about
one out of five kernels..upon apm resume, the floppy drive motor will
start spinning.  nothing stops it from spinning except i attempt to
mount a non-existing filesystem on it.  putting a floppy in and ejecting
it doesn't fix it.
the current kernel is test12-2, exact same config as the test11. any
ideas?
