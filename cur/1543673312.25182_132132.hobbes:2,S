Well, your patches do work pretty well for me... I've been playing
extensively with PCMCIA today, mainly with my 3Com CardBus NIC which has
really strange TX slowdown problems, by plugging and unplugging it over
and over again, loading and unloading the 3c59x.ko module and so on. So
at least, we're making some progress.
