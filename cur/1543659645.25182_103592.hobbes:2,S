Well, if you are going to criticize others ...
Next time you rewrite a subsystem such as pnpbios, I suggest
you communicate with those who have most recently been working
on that subsystem.  They might be able to help you with the
work or at least review your changes for errors.  They won't
be much inclined to help if the first information they have
about your work is the appearance of a huge unreadable
(due to file mvs) patch which you describe as "ready".
