The Ingo's solution move the mitigation control into the kernel with the
immediate advantage that it'll work right now with existing drivers.
I think that the idea of kirqpoll is good but the long term solution
should be the move of the mitigation knowledge inside the drivers that
will register their own kirqpoll callbacks when they're going to mask
irqs.
In this case the "intelligence" about irq rates is left in the place where
there's more knowledge about the I/O traffic nature.
