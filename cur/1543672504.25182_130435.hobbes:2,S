	I don't mind taking the blame when it's my fault, but this is
one case where you will need to find another culprit ;-)
	1) My changes were fully backward compatible and tested with
old/unmodified drivers.
	2) My changes are not included in 2.5.69 (Jeff will confirm
that).
	Without a more detailed bug report, it's difficult to
pin-point the blame, and I didn't personally had time to test
2.5.69. Arnaldo made some trivial changes to wireless.c, but I don't
believe that's broken. There is of course the irq handler stuff...
	Good luck, and keep me posted ;-)
	Jean
