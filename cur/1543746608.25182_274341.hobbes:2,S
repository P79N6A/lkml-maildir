Have you ever pressed control-alt-delete/init 0 and then gone "Oh. I
forgot, I wanted to..."? That's why you'd want to be able to cancel
suspending.
The ability to toggle rebooting is helpful because you don't have to
edit a config file/proc entry. You can use one key press to initiate the
suspend, and press 'R' iif you want to reboot (eg for dual booting)
instead of powering down.
The other options are really helpful when testing and debugging, and can
be turned off at compile time.
By the way, thanks for all the feedback.
Regards,
Nigel
