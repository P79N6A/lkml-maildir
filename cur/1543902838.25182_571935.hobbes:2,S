One concern: if we're switching hw accel mode on the fly, we need to carefully protect tx frames that are just about going out and have already been set up for the opposite mode.

Turning off vlan hw-accel when the nic goes promisc is also going to 
require driver changes, I believe, so
either way you have to do that work.
If tcpdump and/or bridging needs to disable the hw-accel, then it can 
explicitly do so by some API.  That is better than overloading
the promisc flag in my opinion.  This is especially true since promisc 
is not easily readable by user-space and things like tcpdump
cannot have full control of promisc (if a mac-vlan has the NIC in 
promisc mode, for instance, then tcpdump can never disable it.)

I would expect that you see tags with -i eth0, but not with -i eth0.2
That is the way it currently works with non-hw-accell VLANs (or it was 
the last I checked).
