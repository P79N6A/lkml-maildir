Hi again,
	sorry by insist on NFS, but I am testing it hard these days.
I found two more _probably_ bugs:
1. NFS client: 2.0.36, NFS server: 2.2.1, user space nfsd.
I had a symbolic link to a file on a nfs mounted fs,
	lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           24 Mar  3 13:25 
		/usr/local/httpd/passwd -> /usr2/local/httpd/passwd
where usr2 is the mounted fs.
The original file is often recreated in the server machine. I had no
problems during three years with 1.2 and 2.0 saga, but today, instead of
the symbolic link, I found a corrupted file. Its content was the first 15
lines of the original file (stored in the nfs server). It's quite
strange....
2. NFS fooled by sendmail (perhaps it's normal due to flock behaviour on
NFS?) and popper.
I tested to see what happens reading mailboxes on nfs volumes. After
three days I've got two corrupted mailboxes, with messages bigger than 60
MB, when our sendmail max size is 15 MB. The server is a 2.0.36 (SMP) and
the nfs client a PII 2.2.1 (the opposite to the previous one).
Both machines have libc5, nfs v2.2.b37, my fstab is as follows:
atlante:/usr2       /usr2/    nfs     rsize=8192,wsize=8192,intr,soft
atlante:/           /atlante  nfs     rsize=8192,wsize=8192,intr,soft
Who is so buggy, me or nfs?
Regards,
