The controller is working fine, but the raid functionality is not
working within linux. Of course you could use the linux software raid.
However in this case you cannot install another OS on the HPT if this
uses the hpt raid.
I have written a small module which does raid 0 in the hpt way of life.
You can send me an email if you want to try it out. The future of my mod
is unknown because of the IDE guys want to support the ata raids. So it
might become obsolete.
good luck,
Wilfried
