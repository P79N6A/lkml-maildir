Roman probably knows better than I do, but anyway.
AFAICS, "quiet" only means the same thing as the traditional "make 
oldconfig", but suppressing questions where the answers are known. (Which 
I think is fine)
I was just referring to the following, which really is not in the subtle 
change category:
-------------------------------------------------------------
[kai@zephyr linux-2.5.make]$ rm .config
[kai@zephyr linux-2.5.make]$ make
***
*** You have not yet configured your kernel!
***
*** Please run some configurator (e.g. "make oldconfig" or
*** "make menuconfig" or "make xconfig").
***
make: *** [.config] Error 1
-------------------------------------------------------------
whereas lkc changes this to run (the quiet) make oldconfig automatically.
Same thing for 
-------------------------------------------------------------
[kai@zephyr linux-2.5.make]$ cp ../config-2.5 .config
[kai@zephyr linux-2.5.make]$ make
make[1]: Entering directory 
`/home/kai/src/kernel/v2.5/linux-2.5.make/scripts'
make[1]: Leaving directory 
`/home/kai/src/kernel/v2.5/linux-2.5.make/scripts'
***
*** You changed .config w/o running make *config?
*** Please run "make oldconfig"
***
-------------------------------------------------------------
Since people run automated builds, erroring out is IMHO preferable to 
dropping into interactive mode, which likely happens when you run make 
oldconfig.
