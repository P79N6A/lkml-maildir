I'm also still trying to understand how hrtimer work exactly. 
The implementation of hrtimers for P6 has not been finished yet, so
I can't do experiments with hrtimers and eHEA now.
I will try the following scheme (once we get hrtimers):
Each device (queue) has a hrtimer.
Schedule the timer in the poll function instead of reactivating IRQs
when a high load situation has been detected and all packets have
been emptied from the receive queue.
The timer function could then just call netif_rx_schedule to register
the rx_queue for NAPI again. 
The advantages of this scheme (if it works as I understood it) would be:
- we don't have to modify NAPI
- benefit from fairness amoung rx_queues / network devices 
- The poll function can decide how long to stick to the timer based
  polling mode, and when to switch back to it's HW IRQs.
- driver can determine the time to wait based on the receive queue length and
  speed
