Ok, I'm a bit confused by the "ON" terminology. I wouldn't mind having 2
separate messages: NOTIFY_WILL_SUSPEND and NOTIFY_RESUMED here, but we
can keep that on hold for now. We'll need a system-wide notifier at one
point too I suppose. I also need to think how to hoook the APM emulation
in there (which is the missing piece even on x86/ACPI S3 for X to work
properly in lots of cases on resume).

But what about non-drivers ? Teaching drivers is hard because that would
require every single of them to actually have notifiers to "know" that
we are about to start the suspend dance or that we have completed it,
which mean keeping track additional state, etc... So that is a
significant burden on drivers to add. Besides, as I wrote earlier, it
may concern things implicitely called by drivers, or other kernel
subsystems (like things in keventd, we don't wnat keventd to block or
work_queues would stop, and drivers could die on flush_work_queues,
which is common to be called on suspend) etc...

Yes, I'm thinking about rewriting it in the plane to France next
week-end :)

Oh, I meant S4/S5... shouldn't it be SUSPEND rather than FREEZE ? I
mean, don't some BIOSes who do S4/S5 expect us to actually suspend the
HW (while other machines that don't have BIOS support will do a normal
SHUTDOWN and thus wouldn't care). I don't know for sure here, this is an
x86 thing ...
