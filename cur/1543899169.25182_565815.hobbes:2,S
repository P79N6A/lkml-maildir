Hi Daniel,
 thanks for the suggestion. The DL380g4 boxes have the "6i" and all
systems are equipped with the BBWC (192 MB, split 50/50).
 The thing is not really a speed daemon, but sufficient for the task.
 The problem really seems to be related to the VM system not writing
out dirty pages early enough and then getting into trouble when the
pressure gets to high.
Cheers
Martin
