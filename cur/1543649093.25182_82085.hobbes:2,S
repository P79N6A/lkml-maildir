Spurious IRQ 7 occurs when something asserts and deasserts the IRQ line
before the IRQ logic has time to decide whom. There is one known
"happens but harmless" case in the IDE logic where we happen to set nIEN
just as an IDE device asserts an IRQ. The second case I know about is
building with local apic support on some VIA boards. Build a kernel
without apic support
