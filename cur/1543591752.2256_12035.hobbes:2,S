Sorry if I misunderstood. My post was as much in
response to several current threads revolving around
device major numbers and ioctl calls (I use both!).
Many postings seem to imply driver writers must be flawed for
using these flawed facilities. Driver writers don't use device
major numbers and ioctl calls because they are brain damaged, they use
them because they are accepted practice and they work (albeit imperfectly).
I have no problem moving to better solutions *as they become available*.
But I have seen multiple references to 'causing pain' for people
by restricting their use while alternatives  (only now being discussed
and decided) are years away in the next stable kernel.
All I hope for  is a reasonable path to get there (better alternatives) from
here.
My 2 cents, with no intent to offend anyone.
