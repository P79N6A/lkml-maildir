I did a little more debugging this morning, and found that I can 
actually do reads from the space described by ACPI and the device 
register, but later when ACPI actually scans the root bridges, it 
hangs.  Specifically the call to pci_acpi_scan_root in 
pci_root.c:acpi_pci_root_add() never seems to return.
I'll walk through that logic when I get back to my test box, but it's 
also worth noting that Vista's MCFG on this machine apparently works ok 
too.
