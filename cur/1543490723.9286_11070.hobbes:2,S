Yes, /tmp _should_ be a separate partition on any decent multi-user system.
Point taken...
As a general feature, however, is it reasonable to add a S_ITMP flag to
creat(2) to create temp files that do not have associated directory entries?
i.e. the filesystem just allocates an inode and returns it, with the file
being deleted on close. We save on having to carefully find a unique filename
for the tempfile, when we're just going to unlink the thing anyway. Of course
this doesn't do anything for shell scripts.
