It was corrupted and the cause of the error, notice that tar was 
complaining about 2.6.8-rc1,
but I was building 2.6.8-rc2, thats because the kernel.spec file didn't 
get updated, the " make spec"
script didn't get executed after I built 2.6.8-rc1, It will execute if I 
delete the kernel.spec file and I
can successfully build the kernel with "make rpm"
