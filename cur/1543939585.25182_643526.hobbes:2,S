No. I really am not. My /etc/grub.conf looks like this:
	title Linux
	        root (hd0,0)
	        kernel /vmlinuz ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb quiet
	        initrd /initrd-2.6.23.14-107.fc8.img
ie I literally run the fedora initrd.
I switch kernels, not initrd's. I don't even want to know if the initrd 
contains some distro-specific setup...
