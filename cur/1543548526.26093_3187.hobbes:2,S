... and init already does the above. :-) Except for one case: the
emergency shell doesn't get a controlling tty. The first mini-patch below
takes care of that problem.
This still doesn't solve the original problem, i.e. init (or whatever you
pass as init) still doesn't get a controlling tty from the kernel.
However, since init appears to be safe from these issues, it it fairly
trivial to fix this in the kernel; the second patch below takes care of
it. The patch is against 2.2.17 but will apply against pretty much any 2.2
and 2.4 kernel. It's is for i386 only, but the fixup for other
architectures is extremely obvious.
