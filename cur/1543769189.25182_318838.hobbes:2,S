One of the options should mention the power savings benefit on laptops.
How about:
	help
	  100 HZ, the lowest setting, is the best choice for any system
	  where the servicing of interrupts is expensive.  This includes:
	  systems with so many processors that the mere execution of timer
	  interrupts on each and every processor degrades performance,
	  virtual systems, where Linux is not running on bare hardware
	  but is instead a guest operating system running on top of a
	  virtualization layer, and laptops, where each interrupt causes
	  a processor that is in low power mode to power up in order
	  to service the interrupt, and after the interrupt is complete,
	  might take up to one millisecond to power back down again.

Joe
