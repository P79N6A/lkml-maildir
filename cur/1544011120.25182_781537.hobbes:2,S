I rather doubt it, but I really don't know the bureaucracy of that.
Just to clarify:
	Old code logs the value of *msg_prio; that value is always
ignored by syscall (it may store something there, but that's it -
pure output parameter)
	New code does not change the format of log message; the value
in that field of the message is replaced with 0.  That's the only
difference.
Whether that requires amending of the existing certs... bugger if I know.
