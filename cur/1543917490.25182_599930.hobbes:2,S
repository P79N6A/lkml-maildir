It does, provided you change the macro definition to:
#define _printk(level, str, ...) \
   do { \
     if (sizeof(level) == 1) /* continued printk */\
      actual_printk(str, __VA_ARGS__); \
     else if ((level[1] - '0') < CONFIG_PRINTK_DOICARE) \
       actual_printk(level str, __VA_ARGS__); \
   } while(0);
#define printk(level_str, ...)	_printk(level_str, __VA_ARGS__)
Gcc will do constant folding on the string subscripts, and remove the
code and the string constants for calls above the desired level.
This is basically the same as I proposed in my earlier message [*],
but with the disadvantage that you need to modify all printk() calls
without an explicit level and add the ugly comma to the KERN_* macros.
Just compile the code in my message with -O and -S and you will see
that the KERN_NOTICE call and the corresponding string literal are
optimized away.
