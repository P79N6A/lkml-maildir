Well, look again; if you use mVforce, it forces *just one* frequency
(min=max=freq you specified), so it is actually okay.
But I agree that hacking proc_intf is not the right thing to do. I did
not see that sysfs access. Where is it?

Very few drivers? It should be common for at least Intel and AMD, no?
