Hi Justin and others,
did you manage to resolve this problem? I'm also experiencing apparantly NFS-related crashes (kernel
hangs after a couple of seconds up to minutes, no syslog entries, nothing at all works any more)
using 2.6.11.10 and NFS V3 over TCP, standard r/wsizes, ext3 on a RAID5 array. Is this possibly
arch- or otherwise hardware-dependent? The NFS server works fine on my P4 on ASUS P4P800 board,
while it crashes my EPIA Board (VIA C3) using the same software configuration. Other network
applications run fine (as a workaround I'm using samba right now instead of nfs), so I don't think
my hardware is broken.
Thanks,
Michael
