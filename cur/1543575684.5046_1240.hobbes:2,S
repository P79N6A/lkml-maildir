What's the real status of the mass storage backport to 2.2.18?
Some people report it can corrupt your data, another that it
rebooted his computer while doing a large trasnfer, and so on.
If it's not good, shouldn't it be removed or labeled
DANGEROUS? BTW, where can I see a list of what's backported
and working without major problems?
