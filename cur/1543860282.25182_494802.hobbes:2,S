Well, I think it's practical to build all arm configs yourself. I'll do 
that for my sched.h #include changes. It's been less that two hours since 
I started the builds on two cpus and I already got 35 out of 59 configs.
It's just that one has to be aware of it. Before Russell's post the 
situation on arm seemed so confusing to me that I thought I'd just 
compile allnoconfig, defconfig, allmodconfig and allyesconfig and let the 
arm people figure out the rest.
