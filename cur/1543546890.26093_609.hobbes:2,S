No, but if the process sleeps voluntarily after N cycles,
you can be sure that the process has all the data it needed
in that CPU's cache...

I'm absolutely sure that they are. With memory bandwidth
being a real bottleneck and memory latencies being high,
it should be worth it to make the scheduler take some
cycles extra if we can make the L2 cache hit ratio higher
by a few percent.
