This is exactly what I'm saying.  I don't want to copy the translated 
documentation, I want to point people to it.  Out on the web.  Where it's 
maintained by the people who translated it, which history says they're 
noticeably less likely to do with a copy.

I wasn't planning to.  I'm pointing out that it's hard.

A) 
http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2007/cfp.php
 under "Publication Rights":
  Further, as stated in the official templates, and on the Credits page from
  the Proceedings of this year and prior years: "Authors retain copyright to
  all submitted papers, but have granted unlimited redistribution rights to
  all as a condition of submission."
So it's free as in speech but not beer.
B) I'm using these as examples of things to NOT merge into the kernel sources.  
Thank you for making my point.  There's a LOT of this stuff out there.

As an english speaker, I am not technically able to update non-english 
documentation.  Since the only common language required of linux kernel 
developers has ever been English, only the english documentation makes sense 
to merge into the kernel tarball.  Merging anything else guarantees that the 
vast majority of the contributors will never be able to review or update it, 
so merging it into the kernel tarball does not result in extra review or 
maintenance.
Extrapolating the review benefits of C code that breaks the build for 
everybody if you do it wrong to chinese documentation you can't even 
_read_...  Apples and oranges, it's a false comparison.  I don't see how 
merging translations of documentation is ever likely to be a win.
