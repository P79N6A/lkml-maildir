This does not solve the problem. Say if you have 2 objects allocated
from a given slab and you want to avoid cacheline contention between
them, then you have to always ensure they don't overlap on the same
cacheline. The fact this happens naturally when you allocate 2 objects
from 2 different nodes doesn't really help: the same single CPU can
allocate objects that you want to avoid false sharing with. Consider
a task struct for example: if you start up a whole lot of worker threads
from a single CPU, then you will allocate them all from that one CPU.
Then they are spread over all CPUs and you get cacheline contention.
Which is why VSMP would legitimately want to use internode alignment
on some structures. And internode alignment is total overkill on any
other type of system, so you can't go around annotating all your
structures with it and hope KMEM_CACHE does the right thing.
