mm5 has a raid-1-related boot oops that wasn't in mm4.
Unlike my earlier reports this was a single oops, not
a string of them.
This is an UP machine with / on raid-1, no raid-0.
The kernel is monolithic and compiled with gcc 3.3
The last boot message before the crash was
md: ... autorun DONE.
The next one is normally
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
So I guess this failed.
Here is the oops, written down form a framebuffer using
the 4x6 font (urgh...)
unable to handle kernel paging request at 6b6b6b97 (poison?)
PREEMP DEBUG_PAGEALLOC not tainted
EIP: put_all_bios
process swapper
trace:

This is 2.5.70-mm5 without other patches.
