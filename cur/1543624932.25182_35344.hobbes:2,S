x86-64 aka AMD Hammer does hardware (or more likely microcode) search of 
page tables.
It has a 4 level page table with 4K pages. Generic Linux MM code only sees
the first slot in 4th level page limit user space to 512GB with 3 levels. 
Direct mappings and kernel mappings are handled specially by architecture 
specific code outside that first slot.
The CPU itself has I/D TLBs split into L1 and L2.
