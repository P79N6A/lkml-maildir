Again, such bumping entails:

	- Test the hell out of it
	- Submit the patch

Who knows?  That's the thing you're going to have to find out if you want
to push this.  Again, the only way anyone is ever going to find out is by
doing *lots* of research (look at things like Ralf Brown's Interrupt
List), *then* followed by lots and lots of testing to smoke out boxes
that don't work for this.
For what it's worth, I'm talking from experience -- I tried to switch it
to port 0xED which I was told was used for this purpose by BIOS
manufacturers.  It didn't work.
