Strange I haven't had any problems using 3c509b's in ISA mode under Win9x,
niether on combo Linux and Win9x machines.  The only difference from what
you tried is that I used my own standard settings for my network cards io at
0x300 and the IRQ at 11.  If your BIOS isn't reserving IRQ's correctly you
may want to update your BIOS.  One possible problem is that Microsoft seams
to have introduced slightly differing IRQ configurers.  I've seen new BIOS's
with PCI IRQ management options for both Win95 and Win98.  If you perfer to
just play with windows.  Under Win9x turn off the automatic option from the
device manager so that windows doesn't try to automatically configure the
card.  With that options turned off Win9x won't or at least shouldn't play
with that card's settings.  You can also force Win9x to give the IRQ to the
network card if its been disabled unpon bootup by going into device manager
and enabling it.
