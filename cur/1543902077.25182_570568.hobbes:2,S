yes, it would change the state, but if it only changes the state in ways 
that aren't visable to the outside world why would it matter?
if power dies you restore from the disk image (useing the non ACPI 
approach), and the changes that you make are just lost

Rafael is saying that there's more involved, you can't just dump 
/dev/oldmem, you have to avoid specific pages.
as for swap, saving that may be required, depending on how clean you want 
toleave the box for other OS's in the meantime.
