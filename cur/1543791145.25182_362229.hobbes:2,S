In a word, yes.
The current allocator has no design for measuring or reducing
fragmentation.  These patches provide the framework for at least
measuring fragmentation.
The patches can not do anything magical and there will be a point where
the system has to make a choice: fragment, or fail an allocation when
there _is_ free memory.
These patches take us in a direction where we are capable of making such
a decision.

With these patches, no.  There are currently some very nice,
pathological workloads which will still cause fragmentation.  But, in
the interest of incremental feature introduction, I think they're a fine
first step.  We can effectively reach toward a more comprehensive
solution on top of these patches.
Reaching truly 100% will require some other changes such as being able
to virtually remap things like kernel text.
