Michal and Takashi,
I've been researching your issue this morning.  I just noticed that your 
exchange had ensued.
I configured my AD1986-based system as closely as I could to match your 
AD1985 mixer settings.  In doing so, I experienced results similar to 
what I'm assuming you described:  Only front channel sound came out of 
the surround and c/lfe jacks.
Here is what I had to change to get the appropriate multichannel sound:
1) The command "speaker-test -c6" does not work on my system.  I have to 
use "speaker-test -Dsurround51 -c6"  (Perhaps this is related to running 
an old version of speaker-test.)
2) I disabled "Spread Front to Surround and Center/LFE"
The explanation for 2) is this:  There can be only one source for each 
of the Surround and Center/LFE jacks active at one time.  When "Spread 
Front to Surround and Center/LFE" is disabled, the surround channels go 
to the the jacks; when this control is enabled, ONLY the front channels 
go to the surround and c/lfe jacks.
Considering the register values Michal provided and Takashi's patch:
The logic of the code is as follows:  (Slightly simplifying,) functions 
is_shared_linein() and is_shared_micin() return TRUE if the mixer is 
configured for shared jacks AND NOT for 6 channel mode.  In this case it 
is appropriate to
set these bits (LODIS and CLDIS).
Please double-check your mixer settings.  I added a byte to a structure, 
so the mixer settings can get messed up switching between alsa-kernel 
versions.
I don't understand why the other bit (OMS, 0x74 bit D9) is set.  This 
may have been an oversight on my part.
I am modifying alsa-kernel to run as an AD1985 on my system, to try to 
check these bits.
