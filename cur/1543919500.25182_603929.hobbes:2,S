Ugh:
	In file included from include/linux/pci.h:785,
	                 from drivers/pci/access.c:2:
	include/asm/pci.h:16: error: redefinition of 'pci_domain_nr'
	include/linux/pci.h:692: error: previous definition of 'pci_domain_nr' was here
	include/asm/pci.h:22: error: redefinition of 'pci_proc_domain'
	include/linux/pci.h:694: error: previous definition of 'pci_proc_domain' was here
	make[1]: *** [drivers/pci/access.o] Error 1
I'll see if I can fix it up...
thanks,
