That would be much nicer of course, but also more work. It's doable, I've
figured out enough about xconfig and tcl/tk now that I think I can do it,
but it's just more work and the current patch seemed to do the job. Ok, so
call me lazy ;-)  I didn't want to wait too long with sending in some
patch to make xconfig more useable. I'll try to make time for a scrolling
patch :-)
