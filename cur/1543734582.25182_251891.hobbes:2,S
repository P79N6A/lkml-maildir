What do you mean?
Your driver has 2 heads, both of which have independent outputs and
separate framebuffers, then register your driver twice:
display0->fb0->framebuffer0-|
                            common par
display1->fb1->framebuffer1-|
Or outputs are interdependent with a common framebuffer, then register the
driver once:
                           par0
display0->fb0->framebuffer-|
	                   par1
Or outputs are independent, but shares a common framebuffer, then register
driver twice, each info with the same pointer to framebuffer:
              par0
display0->fb0-|
              framebuffer
display1->fb1-|
	      par1
