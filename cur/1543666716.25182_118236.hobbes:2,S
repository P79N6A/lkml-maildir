nice works given a PID.  You can call renice(1) from the command line or
you can use the nice(2) or setpriority(2) system calls.
Note you need to be root to lower the nice value (increase the priority)
of a process.
Unfortunately mlockall() only works from a process in the address
space.  And it is not inherited on fork().  Tough luck.
