In short, the reason for disallowing multiple lines per call is that
printk() will be less complex, while not really changing the
complexity of the callers (a change in the code, yes, but the changes
are trivial, and, actually, not that many).
I think I see now, though, that my changes will not gain support if I
do not lift this restriction.
You can find my current "mysterious later changes" as patches, with
descriptions, at this address:

Thanks for the tip, though. I am quite new to the kernel business, so
bear with me :)
Kind regards,
