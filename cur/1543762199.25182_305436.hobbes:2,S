No.

Hm, I don't think so.  But of course I have some nfsv4 patches, and the
nfsv4 nfsd code does use schedule_delayed_work().  It's possible the
cleanup is wrong, and that bringing nfsd up and down could get nfsv4
into some bad state.  I'll take a look.  Would that explain this?
I'm not claiming this is a recent regression, by the way; apm resume has
always had intermittent problems on this laptop.  It's only recently
that I've actually tried to pay attention to those problems.  (Bad me!)
