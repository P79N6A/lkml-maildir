Yeah, OK, problem recovered; total thinko on my part -- I forgot to remove the in-kernel 
nfsroot code.  Just setting CONFIG_ROOT_NFS=n will work just fine; right now kinit doesn't 
depend on the configuration (another buglet for my list), so if you set CONFIG_ROOT_NFS=n 
the kernel will compile *and* nfsroot should still work.
