No? If it were like this, I'd say I'd really like that:)

Well, Linux aims towards source compatibility. If you want to ship
binary modules, you've got to do *lots* of compilation.
You've to compile for all and any large distributions, and additionally,
some people will ask you to compile with their very personal kernel tree
(thay might have added loads of patches) and their .config file.

If it's like that, vendors of binary modules may face a lot of
recompilation then...
However, such things are usually done in another way. If you encounter
such situations, you'll write a binrary-only core module plus some glue
code which will compiled on the client's system. You hardcode your
binary interface, the customer compiles Linux' source-comparible
interface. That'll resolve the problem.
However, you see that it's a PITA to live with binary-only modules. It's
easier to release sources:)
