It is a "pretty much for free" feature. In your in-kernel
implementation you hopefully already have the ability to skip blocks
in use by other files. So allocating it to a special file will take
care of the kernel part. Next you need one line in your fsck to
prevent that "dangling inode" getting linked into lost+found. Then you
do need a utility to actually be able to mark blocks as bad.
