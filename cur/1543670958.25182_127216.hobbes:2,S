The bios is in segment 0xf000. You set ES to that area. ES:DI will
start at 0 if bx=0 in the code shown. The BIOS is only 64k.
This means that where bx is being incremented (it should be incw, not
incb). It would generate an assembly error with incb which is why
I knew you didn't even try it.  -- you just jnz back to 1b, without
any additional test.
