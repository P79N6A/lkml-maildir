The thing that's special about ZONE_NORMAL is that it's permanently
mapped into kernel virtual address space, so you *cannot* put memory
in other nodes into ZONE_NORMAL without changing the mapping
between physical to virtual memory to a non 1-1 mapping.
No, you don't need to call changing that mapping "CONFIG_NONLINEAR",
but that's basically what the bulk of Dan's patch does, so I think we should 
steal it with impunity ;-)
