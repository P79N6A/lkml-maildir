OK. I'll try different things and document them for the
linuxperf site so that others can learn from it. I'm
also downloading a new netbase package since ifconfig 1.46
doesn't seem to know about txqueuelen :)
Btw, are the net gurus working on improving the worst-case

case workarounds are needed to get regular work done, this
just isn't the Right Thing :(
