No, it's like this:
I want one kernel. I have a Pentium-MMX and a Pentium Pro.
I don't need support for a 386, 486, Athlon, or Xeon.
It's also like this:
We have a lab full of Athlon and Pentium III boxes.
There's not a Pentium 4 in sight, and no Pentium II
either. It's too much work to manage multiple kernels;
every box must boot from the same disk image.
