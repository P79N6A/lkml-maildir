Looks good to me.  Trimed a bit more fat too.  Here is the complete patch.

Type: Enhancement 
Description:
	This patch adds a notify to the die_nmi notify that the system
	is about to be taken down.  If the notify is handled with a
	NOTIFY_STOP return, the system is given a new lease on life.
	We also change the nmi watchdog to carry on if die_nmi returns.
	This give debug code a chance to a) catch watchdog timeouts and
	b) possibly allow the system to continue, realizing that 
	the time out may be due to debugger activities such as single 
	stepping which is usually done with "other" cpus held.
