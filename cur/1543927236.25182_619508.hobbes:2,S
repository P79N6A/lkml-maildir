Right, something called "low level driver for the IOMEGA MatchMaker"
(drivers/scsi/imm.c) has gotten hold of the imm_* prefix already so there might
be a problem later, probably. Nevertheless, you could use the imm_ prefix or
choose some other 3-n letter prefix:
immed_* (3 matches)
imme_* (no matches but dumb)
imd_* (none!)
immv_* (none, v like [v]alues), etc.
