But even CONFIG_X86_GENERIC doesn't do what you expect. A kernel 
compiled for Athlon wouldn't run on a Pentium 4 even with 
CONFIG_X86_GENERIC.
Quoting arch/i386/Kconfig in -test5:
<--  snip  -->
config X86_USE_3DNOW
        bool
        depends on MCYRIXIII || MK7
        default y
<--  snip  -->
My patch in the mail
  RFC: [2.6 patch] better i386 CPU selection
tries to solve these problem with a different approach (the user selects 
all CPUs he wants to support).
