Yep. Without really analysing it, I guess SLOB's savings here are
O(1) over SLUB and will relatively diminish as the machine size gets
larger, however with the number of slabs even a small kernel creates,
this is likely to be significant on small memory systems.

That too, although of course it will work against the external
fragmentation problem. This is more of an O(n) problem and may not
be responsible for as much waste as the first issue on small memory
machines (I haven't done detailed profiling so I don't know).

I would always be happy to see the default allocator become more
space efficient... I think it would be most productive to get
detailed profiles of exactly where the memory is being wasted on
small mem= boots. Although I don't think matching SLOB would be
an easy task at all.
