Actually, Bugzilla *could* be configured so that, say, linux-scsi was
copied for all SCSI bugs (linux-scsi could just be added to the cc
list).  The problem though is that Bugzilla will then proceed to cc
linux-scsi for all the Bugzilla state change details which might annoy
the denizens of the linux-scsi list.   
But if new entries on the Bugzilla entry could be set to forward to
the appropriate mailing list with the messaging *looking* a lot more
like a mail message, I suspect it could be acceptable.  One of the
advantages of the Debian BTS is that it's much more integrated into
the e-mail workflow.  (Although it lacks the roll up and reporting
capabilities that are beloved by managers...)
But hey, it could be worse.  We could have chosen the Sourceforge bug
tracker.  :-)
