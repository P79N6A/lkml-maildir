I had nothing to handle - everything went out of the box.

For recent 2.5.x kernels, you don't any longer need modutils. There was
a major rewrite of all module related code which requires new tools.
These are called "module-init-tools", my distribution has got a package
for it (with the same name). If you cannot get that brand new software
from your distributor, look at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/people/rusty/modules/
