boottime:

  (yes, i have SMP enabled even for a single cpu machine; the kernel
   will be run on a multitude of machines of which most are SMP)
log messages prior to time issues:

(hda and hdb are on the same controller; the only active disk at

 except for cron.daily scripts running around then)
timing error starts here; interactive work

testing overnight failed to reproduce the problem. note that the
original event only occurred after about 12 hrs of testing.
i'll install lm_sensors & smarttools and run cpuburn for a while
to ensure this is not related to any hardware issues.
--> other suggestions also appreciated.
