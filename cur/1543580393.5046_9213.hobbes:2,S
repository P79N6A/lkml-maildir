It is only for secondary head support - and all code which is guarded
by this define is executed after lockup occurs, so no, it is not the 
reason why it works / does not work...
If it helped you, I think that rule (4) from my another posting
applies to you - you are just lucky...
I asked matrox devrel again, but no answer. And linking matroxfb with 
512KB binary-only mgaHALlib.a is unacceptable personally for me, not
even talking about license issues... (and not talking about technical
problems with getting mgaHALlib to work in kernel environment...)
