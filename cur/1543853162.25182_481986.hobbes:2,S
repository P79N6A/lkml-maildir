I know that Debian ships both because I have to switch back to the OSS
driver whenever I want to play one of those closed source games that mmap
/dev/dsp because the ALSA OSS emulation can't seem to handle having the
device opened via ALSA and /dev/dsp at the same time and the aoss wrapper
doesn't work for apps that use mmap on /dev/dsp.
