Ok, i'm at it again putting my foot in my mouth:
A kernel module, can it use standard .so libs?
If so, these sb-live kernel modules, why can't the major part of the code be
in SMP+UP (or only one version if a kernel module wrapper works
wonders )versions of a library and the kernel module just a wrapper for it?
When the module loads it can setup some locking functions and stuff for the
lib by simply calling a
setupKernelSpecificFunction(lockfunk,unlockfunck,outb,.... and so on);
This would make the sblive module in the normal kernel, but require an
libSbLive[UP|SMP].so from creative?
The binary-only-libs would only have to upgraded with the libc upversions.
Or then again, i'm probably totally wrong, as maybe .so libs can't live in
kernel space(?).
