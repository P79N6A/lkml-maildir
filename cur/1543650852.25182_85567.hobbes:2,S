Uh ... have you read the patches?  Do you see how few the
changes are to non-dump code?  Do you know that most of those
changes only get triggered in a crash situation anyway?
Breakage occurs when people change code areas that are used
all the time, like VM, network, block layer, etc.
Look at the patches and tell me where we are causing overhead
and and seriously potential breakage.  If you find problems,
then tell us, don't just comment on breakage scenarios.

Sure, then remove all of the extra filesystems, sound drivers,
etc., that are bulking up the kernel distribution now and give
them to the distributors to include.

If I could think of a better balance to ease his load, I would.
He's already made his mind up.  It doesn't mean it won't end up
merged by someone else (or everyone else for that matter).
