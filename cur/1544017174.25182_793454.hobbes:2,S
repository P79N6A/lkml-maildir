Under what conditions would a system be alive and relying on freezing,
*and* an emergency thaw would be worse than whatever reason you're doing
an emergency sync?
Hmm.. guess you *could* get into trouble if you tried to do a Sysrq-[not-s]
and hit the wrong key - but you have the same danger if you have *any*
sysrq- invoking an emergency_thaw and hit it by accident...
