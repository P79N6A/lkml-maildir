Hello
On an ARM board we're trying to transmit data with 921600 bauds and we're
getting input overruns, and the handshaking line is not set... It's a
SA-1100 external UART. I checked - this message comes from
drivers/char/n_tty.c:
n_tty_receive_overrun(tty);
called from
n_tty_receive_buf
which is a member in
struct tty_ldisc tty_ldisc_N_TTY...
Here my quick look stopped - I know nothing about how tty work... Where's
the problem? It's 2.4.13-ac5-rmk2 with local modifications... (Trizeps
board).
Thanks in advance
Guennadi
