That is _exactly_ what /proc is supposed to be.  Years ago when procfs was
just being introduced, that was it's sole purpose -- access to process
information without having to root through /dev/kmem to walk the process
tree in kernel space.
It has become nothing less than a run-down slum of the linux kernel.  Every-
body and everything is buried in /proc and accessed via the stupidest and
most _inefficient_ mean imaginable.  Case in point, how do you tell how
many processors are in the machine?  (this _is_ a simple ulong in kernel
space.) [Answer: parse an arch dependant /proc/cpuinfo wasting several
thousand times the cpu necessary to copy a fucking number.]
But I digress...

I don't need to, I work in a solaris world.
/proc is an evil abomination.  Unfortunately, there are too many people to
kill to straighten this mess out -- and nothing to stop it from devolving
in the future.

No, but /proc/rtc (and 150% of the other shit in /proc) is designed for
human interaction.  That's perfectly ok as long as you provide an interface
designed for non-humans.  Gee, how much of a speed up could be seen if
there weren't all this needless sprintf() and sscanf() stupidity being
forced into every application on the drive?
Just look at 'free' for god sake...  how many programs need memory util
stats?
