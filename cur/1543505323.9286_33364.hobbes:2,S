Folks,
Thanks for many warm hands on helping my problem.  Special thanks to Daniel,
Dave and Douglas.
I used fdisk and was able to make two partitions. One from cyliner 3 to 4003
(4GB) and another from 4004 to 8683 (4.6GB).  Then I used "w" option to
write table to disk and exit.  It looks OK.  However, after reboot system,
the partition table is gone.  I have to re-do the process again.
I must missing something here. 
I am using RedHat 6.0 (Linux 2.2.5) and my driver is loaded through command
"insmod hpfc" where "hpfc" is my driver name.  Need advice there again.
Thanks!
