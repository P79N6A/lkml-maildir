Do you mean the PLL_CFG code that's been in -mm for the last couple
of weeks, or just the recently posted update? The update replaced
in-kernel /proc/cpuinfo parsing (gross) with OF queries taken straight
from the pmac code in arch/ppc/platform/.
I'm ignoring 970/G5 until IBM releases the damn documentation.
