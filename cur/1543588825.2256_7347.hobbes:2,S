Hi Folks.
Under all of the kernels I have access to try ( 2.2.19, 2.4.X & 2.4.X-ac* ),
when I try and write an image in XA2 format to my SCSI writer ( Yamaha
CDR-400t ), I get a DMA overrun. When I try with a kernel patched with the
beta symbios driver ( 2.1.9 ), it works just fine.
This is on a Debian woody system, using cdrecord 1.10 ( also 1.9 and 1.8
with the same symptoms ) attached to a Tekram DC390F.
Transcript as follows :
cdrecord dev=0,3,0 -dummy -xa2 firmware.iso
Cdrecord 1.10a18 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2001 Jörg Schilling
scsidev: '0,3,0'
scsibus: 0 target: 3 lun: 0
Linux sg driver version: 3.1.17
Using libscg version 'schily-0.5'
Device type    : Removable CD-ROM

Device seems to be: Yamaha CDR-400.
Using generic SCSI-3/mmc CD-R driver (mmc_cdr).
Driver flags   : SWABAUDIO
Starting to write CD/DVD at speed 1 in dummy mode for single session.
Last chance to quit, starting dummy write in 1 seconds.
cdrecord: Input/output error. write_g1: scsi sendcmd: retryable error
CDB:  2A 00 00 00 01 C2 00 00 1F 00

DMA overrun, resid: -248
cmd finished after 0.579s timeout 40s

And while that lot happens, I get
sym53c875-0-<3,*>: target did not report SYNC.
sym53c875-0-<3,*>: extraneous data discarded.
sym53c875-0-<3,*>: COMMAND FAILED (89 0) @c12a3800.
Standard burns work ok, it's just the xa2 stuff I have a problem with so
far. I also tried using the old NCR driver with the same results.
Anybody got any ideas?
Cheers,
Eamonn
