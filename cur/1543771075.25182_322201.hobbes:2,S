I don't know if a real API is really needed for that. For example, I
played a bit with the (single) 7-segment display of one of my VAXen
running Linux. Other VAXen only have 8 LEDs in a row.  Using these LEDs
for debugging, I most probably just want to output *anything* to the
LEDs so I just use defined constants for that.
However, the principle could be reversed by using a 7-segment "font", a
mapping function and an initializer which specifies which bit belongs to
which bar of the 7-segment display... But maybe it's really worth
mplementing it as a library function...
