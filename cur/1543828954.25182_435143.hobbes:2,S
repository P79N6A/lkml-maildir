we are in the process of switching, which is not unproblematic. on
the other hand, we have to support existing installations as well.
by the way ... "switching is not unproblematic": I just had to examine
a notebook which had problems with our software: a
"toshiba portege m400". 2.4 seems to work so far, as does 2.6.16.
I also tried 2.6.17, but get a strange problem: it simply hangs
after writing "PCI: probing hardware" (or similar). A closer look
reveals that it hangs in drivers/pci/probe.c, in pci_read_bases. What's
exactly going on, I don't know...
this shows that sometimes the old stuff works better than the new
stuff ;-)
kind regards,
