Subject: [BUG] Race condition with it_real_fn in kernel/itimer.c

OK, I found this bug on an older version of Ingo's RT kernel with my own
customizations. This is a very hard to get race condition but my logging
traced it pretty good and this looks like it may also be a bug for both
Ingo's RT kernel and the vanilla kernel. This was on an SMP machine.
Here's the race (since this was initiated with XFree86, I'll use it as
the userland process that started this):
XFree86: calls sys_call 
    -> sys_setitimer
       -> do_setitimer 
           (grabs tsk->sighand->siglock)
           -> del_timer_sync
     which has the following code:
	for_each_online_cpu(i) {
		base = &per_cpu(tvec_bases, i);
		if (base->running_timer == timer) {
			while (base->running_timer == timer) {
				cpu_relax();
				preempt_check_resched();
			}
			break;
		}
	}
If the timer hasn't gone off yet on another cpu, it will spin until it
is finished. Now here's the problem:
ksoftirqd: calls do_softirq -> ... -> run_timer_softirq
      -> __run_timers
        -> it_real_fn
            -> send_group_sig_info
              -> group_send_sig_info
                  (grabs p->sighand->siglock)
Now, since the ksoftirqd is what changes running_timer, we have a
deadlock! 
What would be the harm in doing something like:
