Oy. Just know that without CC:ing people, I'm having to add Jeff back
in by hand, and we may not notice your messages. Please, with whatever
you're using to send email, CC: people that you want to read your
messages, okay? LKML gets a lot of messages, and it's easy to miss
some.

No, not in the least. When power supplies are on the edge and
overloaded, the quality of power drops. 12V lines may only supply 11
or less, etc. Some components in your computer will deal with it fine,
others won't.
In general, if you have weird hardware problems and you're ruled out
memory and overheating, the power supply is almost always the next
thing to check.
