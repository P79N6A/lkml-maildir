No. It has nothing to do with atomicity and all to do with ordering.
For example test_bit, clear_bit, set_bit, etc are all atomic but none
place any restrictions on ordering.
__test_and_change_bit has no restriction on ordering, so as long as
the correct operands are clobbered, a "memory" clobber to enforce a
compiler barrier is not needed.

Yes, but that is for cases where "memory" is being used to say that
some otherwise unspecified memory is actually being changed, rather
than to provide a compiler barrier as is the case for test_and_set_bit
and co.

You should read Documentation/atomic_ops.txt and memory-barriers.txt,
which are quite useful and should be uptodate.
