I don't
The problem he is reporting is also on the SCSI side. Now two things
have changed over time
#1 The 2.4 scsi driver (Justin's notably so) is more aggressive than 2.0
ever was about speeds. It will pick Ultra80 or Ultra160 if the bus
appears capable and the drives do. The old 2.0 code probably never
picked anything more enterprising than 20Mhz.
That does mean that marginal termination will show up when it was
apparently ok both in Linux and in older windows which was also
generally rather conservative
#2 Its a newer driver. aic7xxx_old is the driver we used to use and
trying that might be informative too.
