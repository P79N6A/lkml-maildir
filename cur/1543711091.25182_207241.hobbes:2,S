I'm running some internally developed AIO tests and have discovered two
behaviors that appear to disagree with POSIX:
aio_read operations with bogus file descriptors or bogus signal numbers
in their aiocbp structures are simply ignored without error conditions
being returned.
aio_cancel isn't returning the appropriate values when all operations
have already completed.
I'm not sure exactly where to direct this information, though.  Any
pointers would be appreciated...
Take care,
Jason
