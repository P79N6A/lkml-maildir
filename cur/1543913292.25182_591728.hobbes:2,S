At the moment, distributors should not provide the experimental
firewire-* drivers as the only or primary FireWire drivers, unless they
know exactly what the gotchas are.  As a hint, CONFIG_FIREWIRE currently
depends on EXPERIMENTAL, CONFIG_IEEE1394 does not.  Some basic
information can be found at
