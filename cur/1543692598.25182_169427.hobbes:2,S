test6 was the first 2.5/2.6 kernel that psmouse_noext=1 wasn't necessary
to make my synaptics touchpad work. but i noticed it's much more
sensible (with leads to be very difficult to hit xmms' pause button :)
than using it with noext option. is anyone working in an user level
application to configure 2.6's synaptics touchpad driver?
thanks again for your effort
