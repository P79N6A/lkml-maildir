Ok I've been looking through the source to see how to do this properly.
I can't figure out where ide_generic_resume() is called from. It doesn't
look like its called from ide_complete_power_step() I want to know
because I want the HPA stuff to be done right after ide_generic_resume()
is called. I'll do some testing to see if it works to get called before
and after the DMA stuff.
Thanks,
Lee
