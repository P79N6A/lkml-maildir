Your patch would add one new corner case:
start: next_pending==1. rcp->cur == 11.
cpu 1: rcu_start_back sets next_pending to 0.
cpu 2: rdp->batch = rcp->cur + 1 [i.e. wait for end of period 12]
cpu 2: notices next_pending == 0, tries to acquire the spinlock [blocks]
cpu 1: rcp->cur++ [i.e. start period 12]
cpu 1: releases the spinlock
cpu 2: gets the spinlock, sets next_pending to 1 and exits.
Now next_pending is 1 [i.e. at the end of grace period 12 grace period 
13 is automatically started], although noone has callbacks waiting for 
period 13.
This is not fatal: the combination is rare, so perhaps we could tolerate 
the race. But on the other hand the sequence locks are outside of the 
hot paths and not much slower than a smp_rmb().
Dipankar - what do you think?
