Subject: CLOSE_WAIT bug?

Hi all,
I suppect that there is bug in both kernel 2.2.19 and 2.4.5.
The situation is as follow.
One server socket created and listening, blocking on select(),
once a client connect to that port, there is another thread in server
side issues a close() to the new connection. 
After the client close the connection. The connection in server side will
stuck on CLOSE_WAIT forever until the program being killed.
I have attached a program to trigger the bug.
The program is written base on a bugtraq post on this link:
  
http://archives.indenial.com/hypermail/bugtraq/1999/January1999/0015.html
This is the output of "netstat -anop":
tcp   1   0 127.0.0.1:52882   127.0.0.1:1031  CLOSE_WAIT   -  off (0.00/0/0)
tcp   1   0 127.0.0.1:52882   127.0.0.1:1030  CLOSE_WAIT   -  off (0.00/0/0)
You can see that there is no owner and the timer is off.
I encounter this in my server program and the CLOSE_WAIT thread eat up
all the resource as it cannot be released.
I have tried this on kernel 2.2.16, 2.2.19, 2.4.5 and using
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0), all this have such problem.
I am new to kernel hacking. I don't know whether this is a bug or not. 
Please correct me if I am doing something wrong and forgive my poor
description.  :)
Thanks
Dicky

// This program will kill a random port on a linux machine. The kernel will
// forever listen to that port and send the connections nowhere. Tested with
// Linux kernel 2.0.35 and libc-2.0.7. Requires LinuxThreads to compile,
// but removing LinuxThreads from your system will not solve the problem.
// The bug is triggered when a multithreaded program closes a socket from
// one thread while another thread is selecting on it. A subsequent abort
// leaves the socket in never-never land.
// Do not underestimate the risk of this exploit. While this program
// is mild, more vicious programs could lock large numbers of ports or
// replicate this same attack on an active connection with large
// send/receive buffers full of data. This could cause large increases
// in kernel memory consumption.
