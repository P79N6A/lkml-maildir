Jeremy Fitzhardinge pointed out that looking at the boot_params
struct to determine if the system is running in a paravirtual
environment is not reliable for the Xen case, currently. He also
points out that there already exists a function to determine if
the system is running in a paravirtual environment. So let's use
that instead. This gets rid of the preprocessor test too.

Duh, I should have been able to find that :-/. Thanks for the pointer.

paravirt_enabled() returns 0 if CONFIG_PARAVIRT is not set, or if a
paravirt-enabled kernel is run on bare hardware: dom0. If that is right,
then it is exactly what is needed.
