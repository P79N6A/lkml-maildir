If you enable automatic DMA in the kernel config, it isn't necessary at
all. The VIA driver sets up everything.

Well, in my opinion it was always a potentially dangerous option and so
it remains. I'll update the VIA driver to make sure its not dangerous
at least with it anymore.
Scenario:
1) AutoDMA not enabled
2) VIA sets PIO mode on boot
3) User enables DMA -> IDE driver starts using dma
4) But VIA is still set to PIO mode
I'll have to make the VIA driver check when IDE dma is enabled, test
whether the chipset was already programmed for it and program the
chipset for it if needed.
