Thanks for the report, and the testcase.

(There's testcase code in the bugzilla report)
(Seems to be a regression)

Unclear.  What is four times slower than what?  You're saying that the
app progresses four times faster when there are two instances of it
running, rather than one instance?

Seems that 2.6.24 is faster than 2.6.28 with 20 messages, but 2.6.24
and 2.6.28 run at the same speed when 200 messages are sent?
If so, that seems rather odd, doesn't it?  Is it possible that cpufreq
does something bad once the CPU gets hot?
