I got the patch and I must say I'm impressed.  I ran my "117 image" test
and got these results:
[Note: This loads 117 different images at the same time using 117
separate instances of 'xv' started in the background and results in ~
165 MB of swap area usage.  The machine is an AMD K6-2 300 with 128MB]
2.1.131-ac11                         172 sec  (This was previously the
best)
2.2.0-pre1 + Arcangeli's 1st patch   400 sec
test1-pre  + Arcangeli's 2nd patch   119 sec (!)
Processor utilization was substantially greater with the new patch
compared to either of the others.  Before it starts using swap, memory
is being consumed at ~ 4MB/sec.  After it starts to swap out, it streams
out at ~ 2MB/sec.
The performance is ~ 45% better than ac11 and ~ 70% better than
2.2.0-pre1 in this test.  
I was going to test the low memory case but got side tracked.
Thanks,
Steve
