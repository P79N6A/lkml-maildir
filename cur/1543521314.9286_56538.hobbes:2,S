I may be missing something, but it seems that the lines below
are needed in arch/ppc/ppc_setup.c , in order for the references
(ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD, DMA_MODE_READ, DMA_MODE_WRITE, defined in setup.c)
to be properly resolved inside ppc_setup.c .
   extern unsigned long ISA_DMA_THRESHOLD;
   extern unsigned long DMA_MODE_READ, DMA_MODE_WRITE;
