whatever you feel you get away with, but hey I am not a lawyer and my
reading is that any kernel module is derivative work and thus has to be
placed under GPL. Feel free to disagree with me. If you think you can
convince me, than you are under the wrong impression. Since even if (and
this is a big if) I am wrong, my action won't lead to a copyright
violation. Yours however would if you are wrong. So pick your battle.

Not writing and publishing GPL drivers damages Linux. Nothing else.

Lets phrase this in better words as Valdis pointed out: You can't
distribute an application (binary or source form) under anything else
than GPL if it uses a GPL library. It makes no difference if you
distribute the GPL library with it or not.
But hey (again), feel free to disagree with me here.
