Subject: [patch] i810-tco OOPS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Please apply to 2.4.7-preX and to 2.4.6-acX.
If one builds a kernel with the i810 tco watchdog driver
but does not have this chipset, the i810tco_getdevice()
function doesn't detect this and still calls pci_read_config_byte(),
which promptly oopses...since the pci_for_each_dev() loop
termination wasn't checked  [i.e., <dev> is non-null after the
loop whether the device was found or not].
