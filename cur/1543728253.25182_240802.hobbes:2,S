The switch from read mode to write mode (i. e. find end of data,
increase LASER power to write and pick up writing) takes some time
(order of magnitude: µs) which means some pits/lands aren't right during
that phase. How many pits/lands are broken break depends on hard- and
firmware, write speed and model and for CAV the radial position on the
disc. Fast writers will need to reach a linear velocity around 60 m/s
(216 km/h); one µs time to ramp up LASER power from read to write level
there means up to 60 µm lost.
How far good improvements in the hard- and firmware have allowed to
reduce that gap is beyond my current knowledge. Some figures are posted
