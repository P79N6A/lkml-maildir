Well, if the timer doesn't work, then the NMI watchdog will trigger. So 
it's "supposed" to happen in the sense that yeah, it's kind of expected, 
but it's really bsically just a secondary issue. If the timer worked 
properly, you'd never see it. 
So it's just fallout from the original problem you have, and not 
interesting in itself.
