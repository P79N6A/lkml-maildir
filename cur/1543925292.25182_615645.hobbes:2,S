Subject: [2.6 patch] x86 pci-calgary_64.c: make a variable static
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/9/14

"debugging" is a horrible name for a global variable - thankfully it can 
become static.
Also put it out of __read_mostly so that gcc no longer has to emit it
at all.
