As you say later, stuff like that can be easily grafted on by fiddling
with the bitmap, just with more than one block of MAX_ORDER pages.

That will be a tad trickier because we'll need a way of specifying a
"fallback policy" at configure time. However, the fallback policy is
currently isolated within one while loop, having different fallback
policies is doable. The kicker is that that there might be nasty
interaction with the page reclaim code where the allocator is not falling
back due to policy but the reclaim code things everything is just fine.

And PTEs if configured to be allocated from high memory. I have not double
checked but I don't think they can be trivially reclaimed.

Slab pages could be moved to the user section as long as the cache owner
was able to reclaim the slabs on demand.

All of these requirements are similar (just not as strict) as those for
fragmentation so common ground should continue to exist.
