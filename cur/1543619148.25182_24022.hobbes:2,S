I understand why he doesn't do that: he can't function if the code is 
changing under him in ways that suprise him.  (Especially he can't function 
as architect without doing code inspection.)
Linus DOES apply larger patches from maintainers with less scrutiny, but 
there still IS scrutiny of each patch.  (At the very least, checking which 
files it touches.)

Linus also reserves the right to mess with a maintainer's code and force a 
patch back down the tree for them to resync with.  He just did it with the 
help files (after a "private flamewar").  In this case, the maintainer was 
caught by suprise, claiming to be unaware that Linus expected him to make 
that change, which just seems to be one more example of a lack of 
communication between Linus and a maintainer.  This time, instead of Linus 
not getting the maintainer's message (patch), the maintainer doesn't get 
linus's message ("Go do this, in this order".)  So we've got examples of 
messages getting dropped in both directions, making the maintainer look 
inattentive when he claims otherwise, and making Linus look inattentive when 
HE claims otherwise...
