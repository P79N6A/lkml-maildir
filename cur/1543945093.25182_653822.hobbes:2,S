It was done so on purpose.
The rationale here is that we yet have too many section mismatch for
a typical build to pass my "good stomach" test.
So until we get down on an acceptable level we should not be
too noisy.
And I wanted it to be turned off also for allyesconfig builds.
I hope to spend time on the reaming warnings soon but the
option will not be enabled until latest next mergewindow.
You could argue that I could have doen this in better ways
The present version was just simple.
