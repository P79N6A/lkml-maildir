That really is _way_ too ugly for words.
For 2.6.18, we may just have to leave the recursive locking in place, and 
just remove the warning. With the recursive lock, if/when somebody needs 
to take that lock early, the code can just do so, and then the inner 
lock-taker ends up being a no-op.
Of course, that's why people want recursive locks in the first place, and 
it's also why we've (largely successfully) have avoided them - it allows 
for people being way too lazy about locking, and allows for really broken 
schenarios like this.
I wonder if we could just make the workqueue code just run with preemption 
disabled - that should also automatically protect against any CPU hotplug 
events on the local CPU (and I think "local CPU" is all that the wq code 
cares about, no?)
