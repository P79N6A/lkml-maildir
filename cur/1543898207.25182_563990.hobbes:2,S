Hi Michal,
I've just tested uvesafb on my workstation ( which has a really old 
GeForce2 MX 400 Nvidia card ) and it didn't worked here.
If I remember right vesafb-ntg worked here and vesafb works for sure :)
Here the error from dmesg :
....
[   37.397298] uvesafb: Getting VBE info block failed (eax=0x4f00, err=-3)
[   37.397358] uvesafb: vbe_init() failed with -22
[   37.397411] uvesafb: probe of uvesafb.0 failed with error -22
....
Here some infos I got with read-edid[1] tool:
