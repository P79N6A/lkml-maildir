Hi James, hi everybody,
playing with iwlwifi I try to patch it into the kernel and to build it from 
there. But I have a problem with the build system.
The file drivers/net/wireless/mac80211/Makefile contains one single line:
obj-$(CONFIG_IWLWIFI)   += iwlwifi/
When CONFIG_IWLWIFI=m in scripts/Makefile.lib line 29 the target is filtered 
as it ends with a slash. That results in 
drivers/net/wireless/mac80211/built-in.o not being built and the build 
process breaks with an error. What is the correct way to handle this? Why are 
targets ending with a slash filtered?
