Now that you bring this up here it might be a good idea to mention
that we (you and I both included) have just been discussing this in a
different forum and there is disagreement between the Alpha and PPC
camps on this one.
My point is that the current implementation expects no protection
against reordering and many current device drivers already deal with
this correctly (I checked the aic7xxx this this morning and I noticed
that it deals with this explicitly, even on the PPC).
