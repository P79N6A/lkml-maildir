I've already made my views on this fairly clear (at least from the SCSI stack 
standpoint):
- multi-path inside the low level drivers (like qla2x00) is wrong
- multi-path inside the SCSI mid-layer is probably wrong
- from the generic block layer on up, I hold no specific preferences
That being said, I'm not particularly happy to have the multi-path solution 
tied to a specific raid driver; I'd much rather it were in something generic 
that could be made use of by all raid drivers (and yes, I do see the LVM2 
device mapper as more hopeful than md in this regard).

Well, neither of the people most involved in the development (that's Neil 
Brown for md in general and Ingo Molnar for the multi-path enhancements) made 
any comments---see if you can elicit some feedback from either of them.
