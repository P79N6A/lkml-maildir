Curiously enough, I did not see this effect until I applied Peter's patches
1 and 2. In sum, for a D600 with both nipple and trackpad (so, DualPoint):
2.6.10: ALPS not detected. Normal motion. No issues with sporadic tap.
No issuses with keyboard. Cursor warps to the edge of the screen.
2.6.11-rc2: ALPS detected. Issues that I listed, keyboard dying is the worst.
Warps still present (I wrote that they went away, but I was wrong).
2.6.11-rc1 + Peter's 1/4 and 1/2: Keyboard seems fixed by patch 1/4.
The missing slow motion still present. New issue: sporadic (left button only)
clicks generated by motions.
Can you tell me exactly how I go about "trying out Synaptics X driver"?
