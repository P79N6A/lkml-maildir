The issue isn't the ABI, the issue is that the processor doesn't
support it, since some of the opcodes mean different things in 16-,
32- and 64-bit mode.  The opcodes which access the high half of the
register sets (REX prefixes) in 64-bit mode are INC and DEC
instructions in 16- and 32-bit mode.
AMD was apparently considering adding a "REX32" mode at some point,
but rather predictably noone was interested enough to make it
worthwhile.
