I have yet to use aio_ or F_SETSIG, but reading ready fd's from
/dev/poll
makes more sense to me than listening for realtime signals from aio_,
which according to 
http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=366163395
can overflow, in which case the kernel sends a SIGIO to say 'realtime 
signals overflowed, better do a full poll'.  I'm contemplating writing
a server that uses aio_; that case kind of defeats the purpose of
using aio_, and handling it sounds annoying and suboptimal.
/dev/poll would never overflow in that way.
