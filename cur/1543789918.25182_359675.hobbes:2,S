No.  All the memory is new RAM.  I originally had 2x256MB, and I
replaced those with 3x1GB.  Sorry if the Subject header was a bit
misleading.

When I had posted the message I had only let it run through all tests
once.  I have since let it run for about 18 hours, where it came up
with a single error (as reported in my reply to Ken).

OK, I'll send those to you off-list.
Thanks very much, Hugh.
