I would argue that any system that performs substantially worse with swap==1xRAM
than a system with swap==0xRAM is fundamentally broken.  it seems that w/
todays 2.4.x kernel, people running programs totalling LESS THAN their physical
dram are having swap problems.  they should not even be using 1 byte of swap.
the whole point of swapping pages is to give you more memory to execute
programs.
if I want to execute 140MB of programs+kernel on a system with 128 MB of ram,
I should be able to do the job effectively with ANY amount of "total memory"
exceeding 140MB. not some hokey 128MB RAM + 256MB swap just because the kernel
it too fscked up to deal with a small swap file.
