Some of the assembly files use
.section        ".start", "ax"
and others use
.section ".start", #alloc, #execinstr
(and not just for .start, try
find -name \*.S | xargs grep -e '\.section'
)
These appear to be equivelent, if not somebody clue me in please. :) 
Which is the prefered form?  The latter seems to provide a bit more for 
the human, so I'd vote that direction... ;)
Thanks,
Eli
