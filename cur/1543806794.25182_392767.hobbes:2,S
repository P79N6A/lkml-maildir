Thank you for explaining the policy. In this particular case, there  
was only one use of the ID in the file in question, so it could have  
simply been a hex constant, I guess. Of course my instinct is to  
avoid weird constants like this in source code, but I can learn to  
make an exception for this kind of thing.
