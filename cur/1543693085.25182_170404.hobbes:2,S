Hi!
I have found such strange thing:
pseudo@avalon at 14:04:00  ~> dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1 count=0 seek=1000000000000
After that my Intel Celeron 800 MHz/384M RAM 60G/Seagate U6 under
Linux-2.4.22-grsec on reiserfs was utilized 100% for more than 2 hours.
dd process can't be killed.
Is this my flow or real bug?
