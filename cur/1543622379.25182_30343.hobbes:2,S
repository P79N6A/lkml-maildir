Hmm.. Yes. Except I would allow a NULL backing store name for the
normal(?) case of just wanting private anonymous memory.
At the same time, I have to admit that I like the notion that Rusty had of
libraries being able to just put their semaphores anywhere (on the stack
etc), as it does work for many architectures. Ugh.
