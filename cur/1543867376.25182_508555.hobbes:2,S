Oh, there is a very simple reason for that.
These md arrays exist for a year of three allready, from the time I
used raidtool instead of mdadm.
So when I switched to to mdadm, I just got the /etc/raidtab file and
migrated it to /etc/mdadm.conf, since /etc/raidtab worked with
blockdevices and not UIDs (correct me if I am wrong and overlooked
this featute), the mdadm.conf ended up with these devices too.
Next to that, there is a, for me at least, practicle reason. I keep
adding harddisks, and when I use the block devices rather than UIDS,
and I get problems like yesterday, I have the blockdevice or serial
number of the disk, which makes it easier to look in my case where the
potential problem might be. If I work with UIDs and something goes
wrong when doing an mdadm --assemble, then I'll first have to look up
which disks belong to which UID, which costs time.
OR! which is also very possible, maybe there is a way easier way to
pinpoint which drives belong to which array before starting the array,
which I don't know about yet. So please, if you have suggestions, let
me know :)
Take care!
Patrick
