And if the majority is loose, such a "moutons de Panurge" bahaviour makes
you as loose as the majority. 
Just think about a device that uses MODIFY DATA POINTER message and let me
know how you will calculate your residual/actual data counter and how the
application will understand about the counter value when the transfer is
partial.
No need to consider MDP, btw:  a device is perfectly allowed to RESTORE
the previously saved DATA POINTER and then to complete the command, even
if it is stupid. Let me know how the majority will calculate the residual
in such a _legal_ (but stupid) behaviour of the device.
What about intelligent controllers that donnot provide this information?
As an example, such a stupid "moutons de Panurge" behaviour led most SCSI
device drivers to _wrongly_ associate the CmdQueue flag to the target. The
CmdQueue bit must be associated to the logical unit that is the _real_
device.

So can provide this number the aic7xxx of FreeBSD and the aha(1542) device
driver of FreeBSD, it seems. So, very probably associate the CmdQueue to
the target all the drivers that have been mentionned.
It is not the majority, as far as I can tell, unless you consider that 
that Adaptec stuff and guys represents the majority.

AFAIK, the MDP is still in the SCSI specs. Even if the MDP has been used,
we can calculate such a number, but it can only indicate if the transfer
has been complete or partial (kind of error checking). It must not be used
for anything else, unless the application ckecked that the MDP is not
enabled for this device, and made sure that the involved SCSI device
driver is smart enough not to be confused by a SCSI device that changed
the data pointer by a restore just before completing the IO.
By the way, the CAM3 method is basically some reformulation of some DEC
access method. It can be wrong or just loose in some places and some
non-sense may have been missed by the SCSI committee.
