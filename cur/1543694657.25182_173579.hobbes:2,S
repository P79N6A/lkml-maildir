buy Maxtor and write to them, thereby triggering the remap.
All of this said, let me just repeat that I concede that ReiserFS does 
need to support remapping, and Reiser4 does it.  However, I think that 
we should encourage users to ask the drive to do it for them.  Maybe 
this is wrong if it turns out that most drives are not responsible/wise 
about it, but I need more info before I can say about that.
