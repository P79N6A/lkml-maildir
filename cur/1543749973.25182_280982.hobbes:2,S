Are you sure you're not seeing the creation of a reply packet? Unless
you're testing with UDP and a listening socket on the receiver, you're
going to get a response packet if the incoming packet makes it through
the iptables rules. You were testing with ICMP echo requests (ping), if
I recall.
I think either you're basing your idea of the packet flow on printk()'s,
or I'm just too tired and missing where xfrm_lookup() gets called on the
rx path... (yes, sk can be NULL there, but I was wrong about it being
called for Rx'd packets, I think).
However, if your NIC driver does NAPI, you can see an xfrm_lookup() on
the reply packet when the driver calls netif_receive_skb() -- this bit
me recently...
