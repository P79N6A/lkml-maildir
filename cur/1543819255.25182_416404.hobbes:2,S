I get the impression from customers that SELinux is so painful to
configure correctly that most of them disable it.  In theory, LSM +
something like AppArmour provides a much simpler security model for
normal human beings who want some level of configuration.  Also,
the current SELinux config in RH is starting to have a measureable
performance impact.  I'm not sure this particular battle of the
security models is quite over from a real user perspective.
