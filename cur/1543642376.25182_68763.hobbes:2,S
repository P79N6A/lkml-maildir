             IBM DeathStar 75gxp.
Well put. Also, don't turn off this drive --ever. If possible, back-up
to something on a network, not to anything on the IDE bus. If you don't
have anything available, borrow something from work and make a temporary
LAN. With bad sectors and a relocation list already full, this drive
will seize the IDE bus and never let go once you trip it into failure.
Cheers,
