well really this is fixed in my tree and in some distribution kernels
for half an year, it's true only the major fs are been taken care of,
but definitely somebody had the heart to do something about it 8)

There is no other way, some cpu can't even do it atomically (hence the
need of the sequence number approch).
Also note that the atomicity isn't needed everywhere, for example if you
read i_size in the write paths you don't need to use i_size_read, but
you can read with inode->i_size as usual, which is faster and in turn
recommended.
I described the locking rules here:
	
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=i_size_read&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=20020717225504.GA994
%40dualathlon.random&rnum=2
	  The rules are: 1) i_size_write must be used for all i_size
	  updates (at least when there can be potential parallel readers
	  outside the i_sem), 2) i_size_read must be used for all lockless
	  reads when an i_size change can happen from under us.
