I just want to provide some latencytop numbers which I
collected during the experience described in another thread
( 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/13/134
 ).
The behaviour is not completely reproducible. I've just repeated
the test of opening the 380MB file with xjed and it turned out
ok, just like I dream it to be. 
This is what I had before opening the file a few moments ago:
(Window Maker + firefox + thunderbird + mrxvt + xterm)
[mafra@localhost:~]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        513872     403316     110556          0      49076     214084
-/+ buffers/cache:     140156     373716
Swap:      2144636          0    2144636
Then I tryed to open the 380MB file, which took like 30 seconds but
meanwhile I could switch desktops, type in the terminal and I could have
closed the xjed window if I wanted (ie the mouse was responsive and I
could "aim" it very well)
So far so good! I was also running latencytop and this is what I got
in a random moment (I don't know if latencytop has a record of the
worst latencies. Arjan?):

However, I also happen to have another latencytop log which I could
gather while the desktop was misbehaving a few days ago during
this same test. It looks like this:

I could take this from latencytop while xjed was almost finishing
to load the file. I see some ~1 second figures there, but I must
say that it was taking much longer (like 10 seconds) to get any
reaction to a typed letter in the terminal. It was difficult to
aim the mouse pointer etc (because it disapeared for seconds).
Well, these are some numbers. People who know things better 
can judge them better than me! :-)
