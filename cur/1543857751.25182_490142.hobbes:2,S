I didn't measure, I was told by various people on IRC.  Also Google has
some misleading facts:
 - Someone mentioned that HIGHMEM64G + 4G split costs 10%-30%.  I
   immediately took that as "4G split might be friggin' expensive."
 - In some discussions Ingo mentioned HIGHMEM64G re RT preemption being
   a huge performance delta; but I haven't found evidence that this
   isn't a bug in RT.
Too bad PAE can't be detected at boot time; someone else mentioned that
some recent Pentium M laptops (and anything older than PPro) don't boot
if PAE is on.  Making 2 copies of the functions would be a pain in the
ass; and using indirect addressing and function pointers would be...
slow.  In performance critical areas.
I want my hardware NX bit working in Ubuntu without having to recompile
my kernel dammit.  How do I swing this one past them?  The performance I
can argue; breaking 586 and some random laptops (I've been contacted by
someone who has several of these Pentium-M machines that die on PAE) I
can't do.
