Hi !
Well, I discovered today that reading /proc/bus/pnp/0e
oopsed on me on 2.4.19p2 with the 2.4.17 pnpbios
patch (+lots of other patches that don't help to
make easy reports). Didn't try without pnpbios yet.
lspnp -v triggers it very easily. 0e is the PS2 port
(PNP0f13). I had this on at least two P3's with
different hardware and bioses.
So I tried plain 2.4.19-pre3-ac2, and now it
reboots immediately. I've tried 3 versions
down to 2.4.10-ac12 which segfaults too.
Other pnp entries can be read perfectly
(can provide dump if it helps).
I will send the ksymoops report from 2.4.19p2
with 2.4.17 pnpbios when I get home (because
I'd like to get a real email client - elm). At least
at the moment, I can resume the end of the
report to this :
>>EIP; 0000879a Before first symbol   <=====
c014daf8 <get_new_inode+48/1a4>
c014dbca <get_new_inode+11a/1a4>
c021aa2c <__pnp_bios_get_dev_node+110/16c>
c0120000 <sys_capset+238/288>
c0120018 <sys_capset+250/288>
c021aa9e <pnp_bios_get_dev_node+16/34>
c021bbe0 <proc_read_node+44/88>
c0156f0a <proc_file_read+f2/1bc>
c0139326 <sys_read+8e/110>
c010744a <tracesys+1e/22>
Please note that it doesn't really affect me
because I don't need pnpbios on these hosts,
but some people may be concerned about the
security risk since the entry is world-readable.
I'm just always trying to build better kernels ;-)
Hope this helps. I'll be able to do more tests
if other people cannot reproduce.
Cheers,
Willy
