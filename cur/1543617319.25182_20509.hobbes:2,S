I know it fails in 2.5.1, and 2.5.2
 (do you need more resolution -- the problem is that many of these
early kernels don't shut down well on my computer, so I end up
fsck'ing after restart.  (I guess this should encourage me to
convert to ext3 :-)
I'd be willing to try a couple other ones if you have
specific -pre patches you'd like resolution on.
