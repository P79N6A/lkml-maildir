    Hi all :))
    I had no problems or ICE's compiling this kernel with GCC 3.2.2
and, although not thorougly tested yet, all 'major' parts work ok
for me (compiling, mail, disk, CD writing, USB, networking, etc...).
    I notice a bit more disk performance, but I cannot prove it with
numbers. Maybe when I have the time...
