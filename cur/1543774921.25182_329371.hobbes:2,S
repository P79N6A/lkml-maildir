Well, I can only say that this problem is 100% reproducible with my
enclosure.
Perhaps more data is needed here? The 2.6.12 kernel is able to see the
drive without any problems while the -mm kernels aren't. I can provide
anything that you guys want.
Right now, I am using a stock/vanilla kernel, for using the drive.

Ok, I'll disable hotplug, udev etc and try to boot into single user mode
for that as soon as I wake up (I'm going to bed right now---had a lot of
work done for a day).

Yes, I did. In both cases, just to see if any messages issued to dmesg were
different when unplugging the drive.
If you have other ideas or if any extra information is necessary, please,
let me know and I'll do my best to provide what you need.
Thank you all for the interest, Rogério.
