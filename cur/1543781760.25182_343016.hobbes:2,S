Hi all,
              For the last couple of days, I have been trying to set
up linux kernel under 8MB. So far I have set up a linux 2.4.31, which
just works under 8MB. However, I would be grateful if someone could
help with the following queries
a)          Is linux2.4 just the right option? What about linux 2.0.x?
Or for that matter even <2.0
b)          What are the specific issues that are to be considered
while compiling an old kernel on a newer setup? I ask this because I
compiled my current setup on a 2.6.11 machine and while doing "make
modules_install", I got errors from depmod[%], complaining about
depmod.old.  I had to kludge my way through by setting up a link from
depmod.old to depmod.
[%] Not to mention that on a FC4 machine, gcc 4,x meowed  while
compiling the kernel.
TIA,
