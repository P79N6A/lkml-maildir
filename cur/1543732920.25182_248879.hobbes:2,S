I worry these specialized interfaces would become troubling to maintain.
The kernel (via regular syscall, fsyscall, or vsyscall) should provide
accurate time and should be the final authority for that. 
If specialized applications want to read the cycle counter (TSC, ITC),
/dev/HPET or /dev/mem or whatever, and try to infer time that's fine but
its at their own risk. When those specialized assumptions break (TSC
being fixed freq, for example) its the applications' problem. The kernel
shouldn't codify or encourage those sorts of risky interfaces by
exporting frequency information in a standardized interface.

Well, it was a theoretical example, but I agree with your point. The
math tricks you suggest are usable depending on the frequency of the
timesource. Attaching that sort of logic to the timesource
implementation gives us more flexibility. It could be that the
flexibility is unnecessary, and if so I'm fine w/ changing the design,
but I'm not confident of that just yet.

Yep. As I said before, you've got very good points. The delta() function
is the one I'm least attached to, but for now I'm going to hang on to it
for readability reasons. It will be simple to change to a mask value
later after everyone has reviewed the code and is confident of its
correctness.

I really do like the time_interpolator changes you've submitted in
earlier threads. The core generalizing of timesources changes are very
similar between our two implementations, so your comments are very
important to me. I am open to adding these direct memory accessors to
the time counters, but again its a performance optimization, and right
now clarity is king.

Yep, performance and scalability is *very* important. However
correctness is even more important, and right now we have enough trouble
with just that. All of the arch specific performance hacks have
complicated the current code such that minor changes in other subsystems
(sometimes not so) subtly break things. Untangling these quirks have
been a large part of what I and many others have worked on for the last
few years. So for correctness sake we do have to balance clarity and
performance. Minimizing trade-offs is my goal right now. 
I'm starting to feel like I'm just being repetitious, so I'll try to
move on now. Sorry for the long-winded emails.

Well, I realize this is just a simple sketch, but how do you then handle
cpu freq changes? Suddenly generic code has to deal with that as well?
And then there's those buggy time sources that have to be read multiple
times, or drifty ITCs that (may or maynot) need cmpxchgs to ensure they
do not go backwards. Making the generic code have to deal with all of
these cases will be ugly (and may even hurt performance). 
Clearly, you've said that function calls should be available in those
cases, so I don't want to miss-characterize you comments. However I do
want to point it out so that others keep in mind that you can't always
just give a pointer and a freq value.
Once again, I thank you and everyone else for the great comments!
Hopefully I'll get more arch hooks in soon so you and others can
actually start playing with (and hopefully improving) the code. 
thanks
