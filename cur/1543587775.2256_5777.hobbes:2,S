Subject: 802.1Q VLAN patch for 2.4.4-pre3 & 2.2.19

I just updated the VLAN patches slightly.  The 2.2 series patch
did not change, but is now known to patch into 2.2.19 w/out
trouble.
The 2.4 series patch was briefly tested against 2.4.4-pre3 and
seems to be working OK.
The changes are:
  Allow MAC change to work correctly by recognizing PACKET_HOST
  This should help those folks that like to change the MAC address
  on their VLANs to be different than the underlying ethernet device.
  Compile fix for using VLANs as a module.
Comments, suggestions, patches and praise are all welcome! :)
