The hell it is. You end up with a corrupted page cache because
invalidate_inode_pages2_range() immediately exits without throwing out
the pages in the rest of the range.
I can't see that it is the business of invalidate_inode_pages2() to
resolve races between ->direct_IO() and pages that are redirtied by
mmap(). All it needs to ensure is that pages that clean are discarded,
since those are neither consistent with data that the ->directIO() call
wrote to the disk nor are they scheduled to be written to disk.
The only case that I can see that is still problematic is NFS because it
may have unstable writes (hence the ->launder_page() patch that I posted
yesterday).
