	I was surfing the web after reading the help files that come
	with the kernel source and found this. Perhaps you might like
	to read it...

Linux IP NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION 
25 March, 1999: I just discovered that current linux kernels
2.2.3/2.2.4/2.2.5 point to this web site if you look at the help for
Networking Options->Advanced Routing->Fast NAT.  That is wrong. The
code on this site is not part of the official kernel. The NAT that's
part of 2.2.x-routing code is from Alexey Kuznetsov, , and the user
level tools you need to use it are available on his ftp server in
Russia 
ftp://ftp.inr.ac.ru/,
 mirrored (connection to Russia is very
slow) at 
ftp://ftp.tux.org/people/alexey-kuznetsov/ip-routing/
 and
probably elsewhere (Documentation for this stuff:
ftp://post.tepkom.ru/pub/vol2/Linux/docs/
 and
http://www.compendium.com.ar/policy-routing.txt
). However, if you came
here for general information about NAT this is the right website, see
below.

	My 2.2.7 docs still have this recommendation which seems to be
	inappropriate... :-)
