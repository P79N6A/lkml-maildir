The only time you need any delay at all is after you have send
the chip a reset command (0xff). Of course if you expect the
device to turn ON/OFF something like the old A20 bit, then
you need to wait for it to (1) get the command, (2) interpret
it (it contains a uP), then read/modify write the appropriate
bit. That takes time. However, if you get an interrupt that
says "data are available", you read the data with no waiting.
It's there and has been for a long time. The status bits will
have always been set before the internal status event. There
is never any need to wait after that.
Most of the newer emulations are inside Super-IO chips. They
don't suffer the port I/O glitches that the old ISA-mapped
devices did. You done' even need the "_p" in the port read/writes
but we need to maintain compatibility with some old machines
so I wouldn't change that.
