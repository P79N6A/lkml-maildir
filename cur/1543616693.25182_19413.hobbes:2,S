Hi all,
I've make a patch against 2.5.2-pre11 that is the shell of the ACPI PCI
Hotplug driver.  It is basically a skeleton pci_hotplug driver, with
lots of /* FIXME */ sections for where to place the ACPI support.
I'm going to continue to work on this driver, but wanted to make a
release to let everyone else have something to start playing with, and
to let people know that this work is actually going on :)
The patch can be found at:

thanks,
greg k-h
