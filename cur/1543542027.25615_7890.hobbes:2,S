Linus, when I got my first "speed4" card, (PCI, single chip quad uart
based card), I just typed a few setserial commands, and had the card
running.
It is the 16550 driver that handles this chip. 8250, 16450 16550 are
all ISA. Now we have a chip that's two levels away (PCI, quad) getting
handled by the same driver.
It really would help reduce bugs if there were more shared code. 
If you split drivers, the number of users will drop. So less bugs get
found.
				Roger.
