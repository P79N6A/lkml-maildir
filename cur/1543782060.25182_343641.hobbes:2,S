Well, except for the emu10k1 driver that Creative wrote and released
years ago.  I don't see why they can't do something similar with the
X-Fi stuff.  We don't need or expect the DSP programming docs, just the
minimum to get sound in and out of the thing.
So do you expect Creative to leave thousands of emu10k1/emu10k2 Linux
users with no upgrade path?  I think if they tried to do this we could
make it a real PR nightmare for them.
