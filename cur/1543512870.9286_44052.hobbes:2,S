Duplicate address detection does not work in this way.
Correct way is described f.e. in RFC-2131.
You will not find there explanation why your scheme is wrong,
but you may get this information from IPv6 addrconf.
Shortly: ARP packets with your IP source are legal and common phenomenon.
Even more: on switched networks you get you own packets back
in several exemplars frequently.
