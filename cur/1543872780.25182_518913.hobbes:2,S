Ohh my first patch change error message semantics in do_split(). Initially when 
ext3_append() failed we just exit without printing error. In fact ext3_append()
may fail, it is legal and it's happens qite often (ENOSPC for example). This 
cause annoying fake error message. So restore this semantic as it was before
patch.
Andrew please apply incremental patch what fix it:
