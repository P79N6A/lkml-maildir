It isn't true in the *present*, except with a compiler on my home
machine.  :-) 
__thread int i1;
void
f3 (void)
{
  int x = i1;
  __asm__ __volatile__ ("#dragons be here.  %0" : "+r" (x));
  i1 = x;
}
current mainline with -O2 -S -mtls-size=16
f3:
        addi 9,2,i1@tprel
        lwz 0,0(9)
#APP
        #dragons be here.  0
#NO_APP

Same thing with my modified compiler.

        lwz 0,i1@tprel(2)

        #dragons be here.  0
#NO_APP
