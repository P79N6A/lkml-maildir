(I dragged you back onto the mailing list)
Thanks for testing.  The semantics of sched_yield() have changed
significantly in 2.5.  Probably correctly, but it is breaking a
few things which were tuned for the old semantics.  Amongst those
things are OpenOffice and, it seems, ext3 transaction batching.
The transaction batching does good things under some situations,
and we want it to keep working.  I'll sit tight for the while, see
where shed_yield() behaviour ends up.  If we still have a problem
then probably a schedule_timeout(1) in there would suffice.

No. ext2 will not exhibit this problem.
