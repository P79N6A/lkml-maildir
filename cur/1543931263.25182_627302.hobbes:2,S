First issue with your repo is that all dates are wrong.  In my repo I 
paid particular attention to author original email addresses, date and 
time zone for each commit, taken from the announcement messages, etc. or 
from the file with the latest date in tar archives, or from the date of 
the used patch file when it made sense.
