Ok, then, this is not what I'm seeing.  The last su amanda was done on 
an almost virgin shell, having only executed that echo 1 to the 
overcommit_memory var in /proc.
I tried it from other shells too, no difference, su is locked, cannot 
even respond to a ctrl-c or ctrl-d.  But the close button will close 
the shell window just fine.
Also, echoing a 0 to that variable doesn't fix it.only a reboot fixes 
it.  Right now:
[root@coyote root]# ps -ea |grep syslogd
  406 ?        00:00:00 syslogd
[root@coyote root]# echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
which didn't kill syslogd:
[root@coyote root]# ps -ea |grep syslogd
  406 ?        00:00:00 syslogd
Ok, I'll play this game, as long as I know the rules, I have now done 
an "su amanda" in two different shells, without any problems, and a 
"cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory" returns this:
[amanda@coyote root]$ cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
1
[amanda@coyote root]$
The two previous boots to the same kernel, 2.6.0-test10 using the 
default scheduler, hung the su command and failed at exactly this 
same point.
I think I need a new rulebook...
