Just so long as there aren't known regressions that would require higher
order allocations to fix them.

I don't know if it is worth the trouble, though. The best thing to do is to
ensure that contiguous memory is not wasted on frivolous things... a few
order-1 or 2 allocations aren't too much of a problem.
The only high order allocation failure I've seen from fragmentation for a
long time IIRC are the order-3 failures coming from e1000. And obviously
they cannot use vmap.
