Hot damn, this zero-length file is hard to get rid of.  I pulled Linus's
tree this morning with this bizarre concoction:
	cd $GIT_TREE
	cg-pull origin
	tagsha1=$(cat .git/refs/tags/v$(kversion))
	t=$(cat-file tag $tagsha1 | head -n 1 | sed -e 's/object //')
	cg-diff -r $t -r $(cat .git/refs/heads/origin) > $PULL/linus.patch
and the resulting diff has:
Index: include/asm-ia64/ioctl32.h

which of course doesn't remove that file at all.
And I bet that when Linus releases patch-2.6.12-rc5.gz and patch-2.6.12.gz,
they will have the same construct.  AFAICT, the patch-based people will
need to download a full new tarball to get rid of this dang file.
It all wouldn't really matter much, except apparently the mere presence of
this file breaks the UML build.
Frazzle.  Paolo, I'm almost wondering if we should change that test to also
check for a zero-length file.
