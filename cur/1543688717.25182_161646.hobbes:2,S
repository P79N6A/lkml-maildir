Yes, but sometimes it feels like a merger would be better... As long as
the propper quantum usage prevails =)

Humm, yeah, that should work automatically with the "used the full
quantum" if thats still in that is... =)

Well my idea was more... The highest pri gets MIN_QUANT and a preemt
can't happen faster than MIN_QUANT or so.. 
If i remember correctly, 2.6 spends much more time doing the actual
context switches (not time / context switch but amount during this
period). The new 1000 HZ thingy doesn't have to have that effect...
And since to many context switches are inefficient imho, some standoffs
would be good =)
