Currently we have an unsigned short used for the number of hard links to a
file.
I have an application which uses 30,000 hard links and I had hoped to scale
it to more than 64K hard links...
Is there any possibility that this could be changed in future kernels?  Or is
POSIX forcing it to be only a 16bit number?
