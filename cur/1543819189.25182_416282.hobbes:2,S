Hey,
I'm using the 2.4.32 kernel with madwifi and iproute2 version 
2-2.6.16-060323.tar.gz
I wanted to insert artificial packet loss based on a percent so i found:
network emulab qdisc could do it, so i compiled support into the kernel 
and tried:
tc qdisc change dev eth0 root netem loss .1%
however i keep getting the error
RTNETLINK answer: Invalid argument
I am not sure how to go about solving this problem for now, so if anyone 
has any suggestions i'd greatly appreciate it.
I really only need to drop random packets being forwarded through 
ip_forward ... however randomly dropping any packet based on a % is 
sufficient so I figured netem would be great.
So in the meantime I figured I would try to insert packet loss in 
ip_forward.c by generating a random number and dropping based on that. 
I could goto drop; depending on the number in the function int 
ip_forward(struct sk_buff *skb)
But then I ran into the problem of properly seeding the random number 
generator... srand(time(0)) is one way... however time() returns 
seconds, therefore i would drop multiple packets in a single second if I 
used this method which is very undesirable.  What is the proper way to 
generate a random number here?
Thanks!
George
