OK, but my machine is not a production machine. 
A, 2.6.28-rc8 with tickles and highres
     PowerTOP version 1.9       (C) 2007 Intel Corporation
Cn                Avg residency       P-states (frequencies)
C0 (cpu running)        (65.1%)
C1                0.0ms ( 0.0%)
C2              105.8ms (34.9%)
Wakeups-from-idle per second :  3.8     interval: 5.0s
no ACPI power usage estimate available
B, 2.6.28-rc8 with tickless only 
     PowerTOP version 1.9       (C) 2007 Intel Corporation
Cn                Avg residency       P-states (frequencies)
C0 (cpu running)        (14.0%)
C1                0.0ms ( 0.0%)
C2                3.4ms (86.0%)
Wakeups-from-idle per second : 255.6    interval: 5.0s

Top causes for wakeups:
  87.9% (267.6)       <interrupt> : extra timer interrupt
C, 2.6.27 with tickless only: 
    PowerTOP version 1.9       (C) 2007 Intel Corporation
Cn                Avg residency       P-states (frequencies)

                                        1.60 Ghz    12.5%
Wakeups-from-idle per second :  2.2     interval: 30.0s

I have checked the /proc/interrupts, the interrupt 0 is really triggered too much times.
