Same here.. I went through the new add_uevent_var() code. The only change
I found was that instead of using env->envp[env->envp_idx] as an argument
to vsnprintf(), the code looks semantically the same. Even with those
changes, the assignment of env->envp[env->envp_idx++] to &env->buf[
env->buflen] makes the semantics look similar.
I verified that the arguments to add_uevent_var() are sane. So at this
point, I am a little lost. I'll debug further and see if the socket
allocation is sufficient.
