Just as a point of reference we are using this code to control a
couple of big StorageTek tape libraries (9710 and 9730).  It has
worked flawlessly.  It also supports reading the VOLID barcodes.
I would second the notion that it should go into the mainline sources
if the author is interested.  Very useful utility in big IT shops
doing serious backup.
