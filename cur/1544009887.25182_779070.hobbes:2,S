We are pleased to announce the 2.6.24.7-rt24 tree, which can be
downloaded from the location:

Information on the RT patch can be found at:

Changes since 2.6.24.7-rt21 (yes we quietly released 22 and 23)
  - fix of owners in rwlocks (Steven Rosted)
  - fix rwlock boosting (Thomas Gleixner)
  - force rwlock into slow path (Thomas Gleixner)
  - fix missing get struct from previous patches (Thomas Gleixner)
to build a 2.6.24.7-rt24 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.24.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/patch-2.6.24.7.bz2
  
http://rt.et.redhat.com/download/patch-2.6.24.7-rt24.bz2
And like always, my RT version of Matt Mackall's ketchup will get this
for you nicely:

The broken out patches are also available.
Note: 2.6.26-rt needs these updates too. We are still working on the new
RT git tree, and will port these patches to 26 soon.
