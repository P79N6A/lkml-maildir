In general, if you're having to combine multiple file streams in real
time, this is the only way to go -- you need to reduce the number of
seeks in order to get the necessary performance, so you just have to
read from each file in large blocks and then combine them internally,
rather than reading a bit from each file and expecting the O/S to
schedule many MB of readahead to reduce the seeks.
Eventually we hope to have a page cache prefetch API in the kernel which
will help in this sort of case, but right now you really do need to do
the chunking in the application.
