Ah. I'm using initrd. With CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE=y my initrd.img is
large, > 3.6MB. Maybe it's time to try initramfs.
BTW I'm having trouble enabling DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW. I can see
it in arch/i386/Kconfig.debug (and not in arch/x86_64/Kconfig.debug), 
but it doesn't appear in menuconfig no matter what other kernel hacking 
options I enable. If I add it manually to .config it just gets removed 
by `make oldconfig'. Is this an x86_64 issue?
For now I'll assume that there is a stack overflow and try initramfs.
