The EDAC scanning code first scans the STATUS register
of all the PCI devices in the system. This status
register reflects operations on the main bus.
Second, the code scans the SECONDARY STATUS register
of all bridge devices, which reflects operations on
the sub-bus.
This instance (0000:00:01.0) of output shows me the
VIA VT8633 is generating the parity bit. The default
poll interval if 1000 ms and the above output shows
this. This bridge is either having a parity error on
the main bus OR more likely is generating false
positives. How to determine which? More investigation
is needed.  
But at least there is some DETECTION occurring. If it
is false positives, then this device could be placed
on the "future" blacklist list and at boot time fed to
the EDAC module.
There is a difference between "detecting" the parity
and "handling" it. Currently edac is setup to detect
and report.
