Subject: [PATCH 25 of 31] x86: only enable interrupts when kernel state has been set up
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/18/26

The sysenter path tries to enable interrupts immediately.  Unfortunately
this doesn't work in a paravirt environment, because not enough kernel
state has been set up at that point (namely, pointing %fs to the kernel
percpu data segment).  To fix this, defer ENABLE_INTERRUPTS until after
the kernel state has been set up.
Unfortunately this means that we're running with interrupts disabled
for a while without calling the IRQ tracing code, but that can't be
called without setting up %fs either.
