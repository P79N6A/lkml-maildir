Hi,
How does one post signals from the kernel (whether synchronous
or asynchronous) to a task and use the POSIX sigqueueing
mechanism to queue events, so that an app. can pick them
up using SA_SIGQUEUE and sigaction?  
What I'm wanting to do is to generate asynchrounous I/O events,
and then pass information that they occured back to the application,
via SIGIO.  However, many parts of the application can generate
different 'events', so I want to use the SIGQUEUE mechanism to
differentiate.
Thanks in advance,
Christopher Boyd
