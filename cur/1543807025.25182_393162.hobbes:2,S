I don't see anything that prevents addition of ->suspend and ->resume
for IDE PCI host drivers (not IDE core issue) if some special sequence
is needed.
I see that we may be doing PIO/DMA setup too late (IDE core issue)
for some controllers.
Could you fill a bug at kernel bugzilla with data as much data about
affected hardware as possible (dmesg, kernel config, lspci -vvv -xxx
before susped and if possible PCI configuration dumped from kernel
after suspend)?
What is the current state of IDE ACPI patches?
Were the issues raised on linux-ide addressed?
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
