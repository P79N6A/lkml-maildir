It's all in the series file:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.13-rc3/2.6.13-rc3-mm3/patch-series
The simplest way to do a binary search is to grab
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.13-rc3/2.6.13-rc3-mm3/2.6.13-rc3-mm3-broken-out.tar.bz2
and to place all the patches in ./patches/, place the series file in
./series, download and install 
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt/
and do the binary search with `quilt push' and `quilt pop'.
It's pretty simple - it'll take ten minutes to get the hang of it.  You
need to create a separate copy of the series file and edit it to record
where you're up to in the search.  From experience ;)
