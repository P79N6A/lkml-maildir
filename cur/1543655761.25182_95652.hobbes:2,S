With 2.5.50 and 2.5.51 I get a hanging modprobe if I try to load
bttv. I get all the normal messages from the modules, bt878 and
others, while it loads the modules. But then it hangs. Unfortunately I
haven't got much else to show you. The program does not want to terminate
with ^C. And also an lsmod while this happens is also going to hang.
I'm using module-init-tools-0.9.3. What do I do to get more debug output?
