It works.  I.e., modinfo will list multiple MODULE_AUTHOR entries.
MODULE_AUTHOR() just creates a special data section, nothing magic
about it.  Several are allowed (in general).
However, include/linux/module.h says:
/* Author, ideally of form NAME <EMAIL>[, NAME <EMAIL>]*[ and NAME <EMAIL>] */
#define MODULE_AUTHOR(_author) MODULE_INFO(author, _author)
so someone thought that they should all be listed together (in one entry).
