I wrote a small patch for that over a year ago, but it wasn't
integrated because it didn't seem necessary because of the noexec
option, and we didn't know about about the mc problem back then.  The
patch was for 2.2.13.  It featured a critical defect, though.
If there's need for it, I can make a version for 2.4.10.
