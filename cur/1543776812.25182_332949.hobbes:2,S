Well, the filp_cachep slab is created with SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN, enforcing a alignment of 64 bytes or even 128 bytes.
So it can be usefull to let the size of struct file goes from 0x84 to 0x80, because we can gain 64 or 128 bytes per file (0x80 bytes really 
allocated instead of 0xc0 or even 0x100 on Pentium 4).
In my case, I use other patches outside the scope of eventpoll (like declaring f_security only #ifdef CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX), and really 
gain 128 bytes of low memory per file. It reduces cache pressure for a given workload, and reduce lowmem pressure.
Before :
# grep filp /proc/slabinfo
filp               66633  66750    256   15    1 : tunables  120   60    8 : slabdata   4450   4450     60
After :
# grep filp /proc/slabinfo
filp               82712  82987    128   31    1 : tunables  120   60    8 : slabdata   2677   2677     20
It may appears to you as a penalty, but at least for me it is a noticeable gain.
Another candidate to "file struct" size reduction is the big struct file_ra_state that is included in all files, even sockets that dont use 
it, but that's a different story :)
