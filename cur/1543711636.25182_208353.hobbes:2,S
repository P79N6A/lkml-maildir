Yes.  via audio example is DMA (second kind), and an fbdev driver would 
need to worry about the first kind (MMIO).
For the second kind, your solution (snipped) seems sane, though I wonder 
where dma_unmap_to_page() is called.
For the first kind, please read fb_mmap in drivers/video/fbmem.c.  Look 
at the _horror_ of ifdefs in exporting the framebuffer.  And that horror 
is what's often needed when letting userspace mmap(2) PCI memory IO regions.
So, an mmio_map() in addition to dma_map*?
