The December ;Login: had an update on the Posix.1d standards WIP which
addressed this with an IO advisory function: 
	posix_fadvise(fd, code, start, length);
which defines advise codes
	POSIX_FADV_NORMAL:	no special treatment
	POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL:	expect sequential access
	POSIX_FADV_RANDOM:	expect random access
	POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED:	expect access to given range soon
				(ie. preload cache)
	POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED:	don't need the given range any more
	POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE:	don't expect reuse of this data after the
				first access
Would this satisfy your requirements if implemented for Linux?
POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED would seem to be what you are after.
