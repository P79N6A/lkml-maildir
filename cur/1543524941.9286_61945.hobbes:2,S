Clarification: The problem is the brk interface, which ignores
fragmentation.  The brk interface assumes all memory is
continuous. When brk runs into any mapping it fails. And since ld.so
is mapped at 1GB the brk cannot allocate any more memory.  This
is agravated by the fact that ELF programs appear to be intially
mapped at 128M+288K. 0x08048000. (Someone allocated 900MB??? wow!)
It would certainly be a good option if libc could allocate
new chunks of memory with mmap, or a combination of mmap and mremap.
mremap is functionally a good as brk but will let you work with
arbitrary areas of memory. 
A good option is to compile programs that need huge amounts
of memory through brk statically.  If they do not use mmap, or shmat
they should be fine until they hit the stack, which is growing
in the other direction from 3GB.  Because the program is static it's
code size is reduced the linker will only pull in needed objects,
and performance is also enhanced as you don't need to deal with PIC,
and register starvation.  So it looks good for compute intensive code.
