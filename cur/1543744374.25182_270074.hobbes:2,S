Just added to the TODO list ;-)
I'm acting as maintainer for the sis900 driver and the list of the TODO
os growing at an awesome speed.
What I'm really lacking is some piece of technical documentation for the
chip. The WoL support depends on this, because I don't know how to check
for the hardware support for it.
For now I'll make available my patch on the sis900 page[1] that uses
ethtool and seems to work.
