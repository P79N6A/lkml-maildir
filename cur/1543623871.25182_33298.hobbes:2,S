Neither does the latest I know of (2.01 Build 27). This shouldn't be the
problem, though, since the machine boots from SCSI. The Maxtor drives
are just cheap data storage. I also think that the linux driver does not
use the BIOS at all, just the hardware.
Well, let's hope for 2.4.19. Will use the onboard IDE for the time
being.
