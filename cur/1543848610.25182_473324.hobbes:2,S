Hi all,
I am currently using 2.6.16.21-0.8-smp kernel and SLES10 distribution.
I have two machines Machine1 and Machine2 both 4 processors SMP
machines.
The /etc/fstab file on both machines is as follows
/dev/sda3 / reiserfs acl,user_xattr 1 1
/dev/sda4 /home reiserfs acl,user_xattr 1 2
/dev/sda2 swap swap defaults 0 0
proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
sysfs /sys sysfs noauto 0 0
debugfs /sys/kernel/debug debugfs noauto 0 0
usbfs /proc/bus/usb usbfs noauto 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts mode=0620,gid=5 0 0
## NFS
##
server1k:/export/server1/s25vol1 /mnt/nfs1 nfs hard,intr,tcp
server2k:/export/server2/s25vol2 /mnt/nfs2 nfs hard,intr,tcp
server2k:/export/server2/s25_2sp /mnt/nfs3 nfs hard,intr,tcp
Now on Machine1 when I try to repeatedly mount/unmount the nfs
partition by the following procedure
[Machine1:] while :; do mount -a -F -t nfs ;umount -a -t nfs ; done
The partitions are mounted and unmounted two or three times and after
that the process comes to halt and after some time the following
message keeps on coming
and mounting/unmounting stops.
mount: RPC: Remote system error - Connection timed out
mount: RPC: Remote system error - Connection timed out
mount: RPC: Remote system error - Connection timed out
.
..
.
.
On Machine2 when I try the same mounting/unmounting infinitely then
after 30 seconds or around the following messages starts to display
mount: server2k:/export/server2/s25_2sp: can't read superblock
mount: server1k:/export/server1/s25vol1: can't read superblock
mount: server2k:/export/server2/s25vol2: can't read superblock
mount: server2k:/export/server2/s25_2sp: can't read superblock
mount: server1k:/export/server1/s25vol1: can't read superblock
.
.
.
Also there are several lockd daemon created

There are no messages in the /var/log/messages.
If I try to mount/unmount the partitions manually without a loop they
completely work fine. I am able to mount and unmount them without any
problem. But whenever this is put in a infinite loop it goes to
inconsistent state.
Is it a some kind of bug?
Does anyone faced the same problem or anyone can help me in the case
what is going wrong and where?
TIA
