yes, you are correct, the composer in particular, or the response to the + key 
for next message, will freeze for the second or maybe 2, that kmail is 
sorting and storing incoming mail.  This is a major problem for users of 
dialup on an auto basis because its frozen for much of the time it takes the 
much slower modem communications to complete, compared to a dsl circuit where 
one can have fetchmail doing the sucking, and handing it off to procmail for 
treatment by spamassassin and its ilk before finally storing the incoming 
mail in /var/spool/mail/gene.  kmail sees none of that background activity at 
all.  They actually run asynchronously here.
kmail then picks that up and sorts it to the correct kmail folder and this 
does cause the lag/freeze while its doing that.
This latter lag/freeze is all I see, but for those that are using kmail to 
directly access their ISP's mailserver(s), this lag/freeze isn't a 1 second 
freeze, but a 10-30 second freeze, and that is truly a cast iron bitch 
version of a PITA.
