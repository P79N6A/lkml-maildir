That makes sense, but how come the numbers for the large file (2TB)
doesn't seem to match with the Avg. Seek Time that 15k drives have? Avg
Seek Time for those drives are in the 5ms range, and I assume they
aren't just seeking in the first couple tracks when they come up with
that number (and Bonnie++ confirms this too). Any thoughts on why it is
double for me when I use the drives?
