Unfortunately it doesn't seem to. Attached you may find some info I could
dump out, as a snapshot of what I'm seeing on my fresh
2.6.9-rc3-mm2-T0.0smp kernel.
Things to note:
- vp_info: the general state of VP tunnables.
- dmesg: some badness occurrences, worth to look and fix.
- config: the kernel .config file.
- top-100: top output, showing that ksoftirqd/1 is consuming 99.9% of one,
but only one, of the virtual CPUs, permanentely.
The overall system behavior is hardly better than what I've complained
before: if I can get to X, the mouse(s) don't work (either USB or PS/2);
calling /sbin/modprobe is asking for trouble; most of the times, it stalls
while boot-initing. Can't hardly make anything with it :(
Sorry.
