Thank you, that's exactly the confusion, I'd like to avoid.
The main difference is in their possible resolution: kernel timer are a 
low resolution, low overhead timer optimized for kernel needs and process 
timer have a larger resolution mainly for applications, but this also 
implies a larger overhead (i.e. more expensive locking).
