Hmm, I think this is actually a Medalist Pro 7200rpm drive.  If so, DMA
is almost certainly the problem.  I've discovered after MUCH pain that
to use DMA with my ST36530A  I have to keep the cable length under
14-inches.  Note that this is probably a shortcoming of the drive, as I
have other UDMA drives running off 18-inch cables with no problems at
all.
