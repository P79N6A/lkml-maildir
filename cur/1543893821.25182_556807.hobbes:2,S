Ok, that's fine.  A sub-volume is the unit and depending on it's
state, it's either a snapshot of an existing volume, or it's a volume
on it's own, though it still has a parent (?) which it is mounted
below?  Do I have it right now?

Ok, so you really aren't talking about Quotas here, but space
reservations instead.  
Also, I think you're wrong here when you state that making a snapshot
(sub-volume?) RO just requires you to set the quota to 1 block.  What
is to stop me from writing 1 block to a random file that already
exists?

Ok, so version 1.0 isn't as interesting to me in a production
environment, since we pretty much need quotas (or a quick way to
monitor how much space a user has been allocated on a volume.
But for a home system, it's certainly looking interesting as well,
since I could give each home directory it's own sub-volume and just
grow/shrink them as needed.  
Maybe.  :]
Thanks for your work on this.
