I think it comes to the same thing really.  Both end up generating a 
series of nops with values entering and leaving in well-defined 
registers.  The x86-64 calling convention is a bit awkward because the 
first arg is in rdi and the ret is rax, so it can't quite be pure nops, 
or we use a non-standard calling-convention with appropriate thunks to 
call into C code.  I think a mov is a better performance-complexity 
tradeoff.
