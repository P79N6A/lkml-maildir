No.
If we wait until after the TLB fill to actually free the page tables
pages, there is _no_ way the TLB can contain garbage, because the page
directories will never have had garbage in it while any TLB lookup could
be active.
Which is the whole _point_ of the patches.

Take a course in CPU design if you want to understand why a CPU front-end
might speculatively start accessing something before the back-end has
actually told it what the "something" actually is.
But don't argue with the patch.

It has nothing to do with the BTB - the BTB is just a source of
speculative addresses to start looking at.
But yes, Intel tells me that the only thing that is guaranteed to
serialize a TLB lookup is a TLB invalidate. NOTHING else.

Yes. Except I will make the 2.5.x code use the pmd quicklists instead
(both fast and slow mode), since that actually ends up being "nicer" from
a cross-architecture standpoint (right now the i386 careful mode depends
on the fact that page directories are regular pages - which is not true on
other CPU's).
