Bursty video traffic is really an application that could take advantage
from the kernel buffering. Unless you want to reinvent the wheel and do
the buffering yourself (it is possible though, I've done it on IRIX).
BTW, why are you so keen on smooth-at-the-microlevel writeout? With
real time video applications it's only important not to drop frames.
How fast those frames will go to the disk isn't really an issue, as
long as you don't overflow the intermediate buffer.
