The s390 channel subsystem busses should be fine with any parallelism,
especially as the css bus kicks off tons of probes (device recognition)
at the same time. Any ccw driver must be able to be handle to be called
for many devices in parallel as well (like, when someone attaches their
shiny new storage subsystem to the LPAR and some thousands of dasds
become available).

It is possible for busses for a small set of device drivers (like the
s390 busses; maybe there are others). It looks like a bad idea to try
this for PCI :)

I think I could make good use of some more parallelism control (for
throttling or so). Not sure if it should really sit at the driver
core level, but that would avoid reinventing the wheel.
