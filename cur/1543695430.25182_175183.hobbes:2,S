Hi Folks
This is my first attempt at posting an oops report so please bear with me.
Please cc me directly - I am on a horribly slow dial-up and do not
subscribe to lkml.
The diagnostic stuff that I am attaching was generated
using kernel 2.6-test9 but 2.6-test7 and 2.6-test8 do the same thing.
Whenever the aha152x driver attempts to load, whether as a module or as a
kernel "built-in" it Oopses. I have attached a gzipped tarball of all the
info that I have been able to gather. The stuff from /proc was taken just
prior to invoking "modprobe aha152x". I have also included excerpts
from the syslog and messages files.
Let me know if you need anything else and I will try to get it for you.
Thanks for your help
