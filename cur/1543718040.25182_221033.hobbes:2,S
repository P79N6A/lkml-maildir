Subject: swsusp also stores system clock

I started liking swsusp so much that I dont shutdown my system anymore, I
just suspend.  Is this wrong? 
But I noticed that the clock also gets saved and when I resume my system,
the clock is annoyingly wrong.  I suppose that this is done on purpose for
some reasons by the developers.
Currently, I use hwclock to set my system clock on resume.
Is there a better way or a patch ?
