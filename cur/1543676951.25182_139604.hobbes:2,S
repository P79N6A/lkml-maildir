An expression is evaluated independent of the context, ie. the fact that
the left side of the assignment is a 64 bit variable has no significance
at all.  But I agree that the warning should only occur in c89 mode, not
in the default gnu89 mode, where long long is available.  And in fact the
generated code will be correct.

Yes, since you need a long long literal.

You can just use -1.  The implicit conversion to __u64 will DTRT.
