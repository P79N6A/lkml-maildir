Kent,
Nope, the tweak was on the machine itself, something to do with the
pci bus itself. Was weird, would only show up under heavy load. Doing
multiple simulaneous ftp's of large files (ISO images) would create the 
problem, but doing a single ftp transfer of the same file wouldn't 
create the problem. 
I honestly can't remember what the exact fix was now, this was a
couple of years ago.
