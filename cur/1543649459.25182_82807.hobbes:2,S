I'm just trying to understand the distinction.  The 2.5 status list had 
dprobes in the "ready" state, and my list started from there.

So this is a two-level thing, with a baseline merge level that's independently 
useful, plus a full functionality merge that's dependent on the baseline?
I'll try to clarify in my list then.
Could you send me a URL to the separate patches?  Right now, the page I have 
has a download link for a tarball:
http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux/projects/dprobes/releases/dprobes-v3.6.3.tar.gz
If I understand the relationship between kprobes and dprobes correctly, it 
would be nice to have a standalone kprobes patch URL, and a second "dprobes 
on top of that" URL.
