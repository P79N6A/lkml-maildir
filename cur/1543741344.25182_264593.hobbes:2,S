Well, letting X get the events directly on /dev/input/event* is clearly
the way to go, for a long term solution.
However, I would like a short term solution, available now, so users
of sonypi could just migrate towards the new way without having to
compile their own version of the X server...

xev doesn't say anything about modifiers. It shows the modifier being
pressed, the other key pressed, then released, then the modifier being
released too.
The trace shows the same kind of events in a working Control case or
in a not working 'function' case:
KeyPress event, serial 24, synthetic NO, window 0x2a00001,
    root 0x40, subw 0x2a00002, time 6566259, (37,47), root:(542,70),
    state 0x0, keycode 214 (keysym 0x8f6, function), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
    XFilterEvent returns: False
KeyPress event, serial 24, synthetic NO, window 0x2a00001,
    root 0x40, subw 0x2a00002, time 6566259, (37,47), root:(542,70),
    state 0x20, keycode 67 (keysym 0xffbe, F1), same_screen YES,
    XLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
    XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
    XFilterEvent returns: False
