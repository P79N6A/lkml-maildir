Thanks a lot for reporting that!
This appears to be a bug not in GNU mv, nor even in GNU libc, but
rather in the underlying implementation in the kernel ext2 file system
support.  The offending change seems to have come in with a rewrite
of fs/ext2/namei.c that happened sometime between 2.4.4 and 2.4.9.
That file begins with this new comment:
 * Rewrite to pagecache. Almost all code had been changed, so blame me
 * if the things go wrong. Please, send bug reports to viro@math.psu.edu
This demonstrates that the problem affects ext2, but not tmpfs
using a 2.4.10 kernel (notice that the timestamp doesn't change
in /t, but does in the ext2 /tmp):
  $ df -T /tmp /t
  Filesystem    Type    Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  /dev/sda1     ext2    942M   52M  842M   6% /tmp
  tmpfs        tmpfs    250M  4.0k  250M   1% /t
  $ cd /t && bash /tmp/ext2-link-bug
  drwxr-xr-x    2        0 2001-09-30 10:49:38.000000000 +0200 a

  $ cd /tmp && bash /tmp/ext2-link-bug

  drwxr-xr-x    2     4096 2001-09-30 10:49:45.000000000 +0200 b
  $ cat /tmp/ext2-link-bug
  #!/bin/sh
  t=rb-$$
  mkdir $t
  cd $t
  mkdir a
  ls -gold --full-time a
  sleep 2
  mv a b
  ls -gold --full-time b
  cd ..
  rm -rf $t
