Unfortunately, I cannot currently afford to buy (outright -- there is
no upgrade path from 2 to 4) a newer version of VMware.  Really, other
than this issue of the local APIC timer, I don't really need or care
to have a newer version of VMware anyway.

If only this worked.  I tried noapic, but it still tries to use the
local APIC timer interrupts.  noapic seems to only disable IO-APIC.
That is why I was "proposing" a new kernel command line arg,
"nolocalapic".
