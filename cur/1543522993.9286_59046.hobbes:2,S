	This is why a pure user-space threading library is not very good for a
database. Fortunately, this is not currently a problem for Linux like it is
for FreeBSD.

	Well, ideally, Linux should be the OS. <G>

	For most applications, pending too many disk I/Os just hurts you. In any
event, if a thread is waiting for disk I/O, it's not on the run queue, so
Linux shouldn't have much problem with it. I don't think it's common that a
large number of threads waiting to on disk I/O will all become ready to run
at the same time.
	What's probably needed is a very good many-to-one threads implementation.
That Linux doesn't have. And you need it (or at least parts of it) to
implement Java well.
