Subject: kernel hangs on boot when no keyboard, mouse are plugged in.

I have reproduced this with several different kernels, including
a standard RedHat 2.4.9-13 kernel.
The problem is that the kernel will hang when booting without
a keyboard or mouse plugged in.
It hangs right after the line:
apm:  BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x03 (Driver version 1.16)
When the kernel boots (with kbd plugged in), the next line
will be about starting swap.
I'm compiling a kernel now without APM support in the hope
that that will make the problem go away.  Any other suggestions
are welcome!
Thanks,
Ben
