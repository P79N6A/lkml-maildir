That's just great, heh.  It will in the future cut kernel code size and matinence
work.

Not to get side tracked, but there is an answer for this.....
Well then let's restructure the kernel's build system soon.  It's 15 seconds
since I read this, and already I'm working out in my head the high-level
workings of a modular build system (what it would look like).
For an example, future kernel releases could be in directories, which contain
the kernel .tar.bz2, then separate sets of drivers and such.  Simply unpacking
these drivers into your kernel source tree could place files that make would
read, i.e. the kernel build system would adapt.  For example:
linux/options/foo.lod <-- Linux Option Definition file.
This file would reference other LO's that it requires, and give configuration
options.  These options would have references to LO's that they require.
They would also reference which version ranges of themselves they are
compatible with.  Thus:
make menuconfig
<M>Foo
----<M>Foo with Bar support
<SELECT> <EXIT> <HELP> <MISSING>
Hit missing on an option, say Foo:
Dependencies for CONFIG_FOO
< >Foo
----< >Bar
----< >Baz [FAILED DEPENDS!]
Hit baz:
Dependencies for CONFIG_FOO_BAZ:
Foo with Baz support needs Baz compatible with Baz v1.32
So you get the Baz option tarball, or the tarball containing it:
linux/options/baz.lod
make menuconfig:
<M>Foo
----<M>Foo with Bar support
----<M>Foo with Baz support
Yes I know this is a hassle, but it's not like Microsoft drivers
where you spend 12 hours all over the net searching for stuff;
the main kernel source distribution tree would contain the
kernel, and the kernel.org mirrors would all have the Linux
Options.  There'd be a tarball for the "default must-have drivers"
separate from the kernel core.
It's just a suggestion for the future.
