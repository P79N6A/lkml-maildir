This is my addition to drivers/net/Space.c (the driver supports a maximum 
of 4 boards, 2 channels per board):
#if defined(CONFIG_PC300) && !defined(CONFIG_PC300_MODULE)
extern int cpc_probe(struct device *);
static struct device cpc7_dev =
        {"cpc7", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NEXT_DEV, NULL};
static struct device cpc6_dev =
        {"cpc6", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &cpc7_dev, NULL};
static struct device cpc5_dev =
        {"cpc5", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &cpc6_dev, NULL};
static struct device cpc4_dev =
        {"cpc4", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &cpc5_dev, NULL};
static struct device cpc3_dev =
        {"cpc3", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &cpc4_dev, NULL};
static struct device cpc2_dev =
        {"cpc2", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &cpc3_dev, NULL};
static struct device cpc1_dev =
        {"cpc1", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &cpc2_dev, NULL};
static struct device cpc0_dev =
        {"cpc0", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, &cpc1_dev, cpc_probe};
#undef  NEXT_DEV
#define NEXT_DEV        (&cpc0_dev)
#endif
Now, the function cpc_probe, in the driver:
__initfunc(int cpc_probe(struct device *dev))
{
    return (cpc_init());
}
Note that the Space.c declaration is just a hook, as the 'struct device'
parameter is ignored by cpc_probe. Note also that the only the first
device invokes cpc_probe, which detects all devices.
The problem is that this only solves the device detection problem, but
when I try to access an interface, it returns "ioctl err". I think that
this happens exactly because I ignore the dev argument in cpc_probe.
However, after further investigation, I found a problem in the interface
with syncppp: the structure ppp_device contains a 'struct device'
structure (not a pointer), which is the device structure used in every
driver that uses syncppp. 
The problem is that as this is not a pointer, it can't be the same
structure as the one defined in Space.c (or can it??) and, thus, I don't
have how to tell the driver (and syncppp) to use the structure defined in
Space.c. If I use the Space.c definition in the driver, it will not be in
sync with the ppp_device structure, and that will surely cause problems.
Shouldn't pppdev.dev be a pointer to a 'struct device' structure?? How can
I solve this problem???
I think this problem wasn't spotted before because all the other WAN card
drivers currently available are only "compileable" as modules.

Ivan
