(yes but the real interactive problems were still there. It's a whole
different issue, PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY is now only a way to measure
processor changing penalty, without any interactivity issue.) I have made
it a sysctl and i've tried lots of settings (including 20), and for pure
CPU-intensive work (kernel compilation) 15 proved to be the best.
