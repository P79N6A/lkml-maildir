Perhaps we should have a Documentation/ entry for this...
io(read|write){8,16,32} are the "pci iomap" functions (see
asm-generic/iomap.h) they always byteswap so the value is little endian.
io(read|write){8,16,32}be are sister functions added to deal with big
endian busses. They always byteswap so the value is in big endian.
Both these previous functions can handle using a cookie based on an IO port
range, or an MMIO region.
(read|write){b,w,l} are the old style MMIO-mapped accessors. They also always
byteswap so the value is in little endian. There is no big endian equivalent
for the generic case.
__raw_(read|write){b,w,l} are also old style accessors. They always operate
in host endianness.
The above are (AFAIK) the only functions guaranteed to exist for MMIO.
Of course, most platforms either provide (in|out){b,w,l} or don't support
Port IO as well, but MMIO is the really complicated case.
In any event, <asm-generic/iomap.h> should shed a bit more light on using
these.
