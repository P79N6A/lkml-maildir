lookup is called with i_sem on parent, devfs calls up to devfsd in
lookup which might again do operation that would block on the same
i_sem.  To avoid the deadlock we have to drop i_sem somewhere which
always introduces races.  In 2.4 and earlier 2.5 theses races where
huge and easily exploitable at least with the O(1) scheduler.  In
current 2.5 they're much smaller so you usually don't trip them but
they;re not going away as long as we keep the stateful devfsd design.

udev is a hotplug upcall, not a stateful deamon.

Not without changing it to a stateless design, i.e. recreating something
resembling udev..
