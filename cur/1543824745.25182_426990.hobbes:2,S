Subject: [PATCH] tpm: fix bug for TPM on ThinkPad T60 and Z60
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/25/232

The TPM chip on the ThinkPad T60 and Z60 machines is returning 0xFFFF
for the vendor ID which is a check the driver made to double check it
was actually talking to the memory mapped space of a TPM.  This patch
removes the check since it isn't absolutely necessary and was causing
device discovery to fail on these machines.
This bug fix should go into 2.6.17.
