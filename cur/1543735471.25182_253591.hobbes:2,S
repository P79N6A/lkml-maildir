Hi Ben,
I tried rc2-bk1 & rc2-bk3. rc2-bk1 solved the problem
but rc2-bk3 crashed on startup when trying to bring up
the loopback interface. The error started off with
something about fib_.... but I was not able to capture
it in the syslog.
I guess I'll stick to rc2-bk1 for now.
Thanks for the great help!
