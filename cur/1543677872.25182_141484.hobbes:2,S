Hi Andi,
  I've already got a patch to accomplish most of this in
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.21/linux-2.4.21-11-fix_tcprace3.dif
It's a backport of some patches that have already gone into 2.5.x to
fix some TCP client reconnection issues. I was hoping to push these
patches to Marcelo for 2.4.22.
Could you therefore please just send me a patch for the
NFS_MOUNT_NONRESERVED mount option alone. Then I'll append it to this
patch series?
This should also make it easy to port the whole thing forward to 2.5.x
(although please note that for 2.5.x I'm also planning some other
improvements that will allow us to share the struct xprt between
different RPC clients).
Cheers,
  Trond
