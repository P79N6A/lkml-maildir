If you choose the GPL as license, the text of the GPL are the conditions. 
Otherwise, the GPL would be pure nonsense (as would be any other license).

Derivated work is a product of several authors, therefore each author may 
put different conditions on his part of the work - as long as they are 
compatible, it's ok. A derivated work originally under BSD, now with a 
patch under GPL can only be distributed under GPL, but not under BSD 
(because GPL requires redistribution under GPL, whereas BSD doesn't care). 
If you take out the patch, and revert the work to the BSD one, you are free 
to redistribute it under BSD.
There's no point of discussing that the Linux kernel *as a whole* (as 
compilation) currently is under GPLv2 only, since it sais so, and a few 
files also explicitely say so. The whole combination is GPLv2 only, but 
most parts aren't.

Copyright law defines "work", and in terms of computer programs, source 
code "work" goes into files. Or patches, but patches end up distributed 
over several files.
The nice thing about this is that you can make automatic checks about the 
license you actually have to fulfill. E.g. if you compile a hypothetical 
Linux 2.8.15.3 without ZFS and dtrace in 2009, you may end up with 
compiling only GPLv2-compatible code, and therefore can tivoize your system 
(unless you sell it to Germany, where the GPLv2 outlaws tivoizing by 
intent), but if you add either ZFS or dtrace, you can't.

Yes, and the GPLv2 sais "if the FSF releases a new version of the GPL, you 
may update" (section 9):
"  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation."
This is normal contract law (you have to say "yes" to a new M$ EULA every 
few months or so if you are an unlucky Windows user, and like to use their 
patches), contracts can change over time. The FSF is rather nice here, they 
say users and contributors can make choices to which contract they use.
Given that the license you find with Linux is GPLv2, anyway, the comment 
from Linus seems to be superfluous. The license already says which version 
it is. But it has this upgrade option, and one possible interpretation of 
Linus' comment is "no, it doesn't have this update option".

If I use GPL as license, I'm under "GPL regime", i.e. the terms of the GPL 
apply. The GPL requires that I need to speak up explicitely if I want to 
limit the choice of licenses - if I don't say anything, it defaults to "any 
GPL". This is a restriction that goes from author to user, sinde the GPL 
cuts away all middle-men (restrictions applied by middle-men can be 
reverted).
If I decide to build my own compilation of Linux kernel patches* (i.e. a -bp 
kernel, like the -mm kernel is a different compilation of Linux kernel 
patches as the mainline kernel), I'm free to choose under which conditions 
I redistribute it, given that it's compatible with the conditions the 
original authors have chosen. Most of them have said nothing (other than 
implicitely that it's ok for them to put it under GPL, as they haven't 
opposed to inclusion into the Linux kernel), some have said GPLv2 or later, 
some say GPLv1.1 or later (e.g. the parport driver) and a few have 
said "GPLv2 only". Now, I may rewrite those few "GPLv2 only" files, and 
then I have a GPLv2-or later compatible linux-some.version-bp kernel. And 
into this kernel, I can add code under GPLv3 (once the GPLv3 is ready and 
there's code worth to add under GPLv3), which limits me to redistribute the 
whole thing under GPLv3.
