I'm having a few Problems with a NEW PC
Spec is:
Intel DQ35JOE Mainboard
Intel Q6600 Quad core CPU
4GB ram
3 SATA HDDs
1 SATA DVD-RW
The Integrated NIC is not found by kernel 2.6.23-rc6 or  2.6.22.1
Am I missing an option in there ??
The Intel Drivers (e1000-7.6.5)  don't compile against 2.6.23-rc6 or 2.6.22.1
/usr/src/intel/e1000- 7.6.5/src/e1000_ethtool.c:2109: error:
'ethtool_op_get_perm_addr' undeclared here (not in a function)
( I know, wrong place to report this ...... )
( also SATA dvd writer does not seem to write yet )
If anyone has Patches to try I'm Currently able and willing to test
them on this hardware config!
see attached stuff
mail me for more info if required !
TIA
