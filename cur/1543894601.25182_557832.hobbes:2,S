Actually, SELinux people 'liked' the concept -- they are willing to
extend SELinux to handle new files better. And not only SELinux people
are opposed to AA.

It was something like 'is there description of AA security model? We'd
like to take a look if we can do that within SELinux'. I tried to
forward them pdf, but it was more AA implementation description (not
AA model description) so it was probably not helpful.
So yes, SELinux people want to help.
