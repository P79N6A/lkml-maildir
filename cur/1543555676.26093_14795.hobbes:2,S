well, first I want your code for linuxbios :-)

you don't have clock interrupts on. If you are able to single step you'll
probably see it in the loop spinning on jiffies. This is one of our
regular problems with a new mainboard.
Also do you have serial console up? in many cases we have found that
having serial up eliminates about 50% of the things you do with a jtag
debugger.
