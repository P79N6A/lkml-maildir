Your patch fixes the problem. That'll teach me to spin a patch up while I'm headed
out the door. I think a cleaner solution for now is just to refactor get_xa_root,
__get_xa_root, and create_xa_root into one function to simplify the lookup and the
locking. I think I'll add another step to my patch set that removes the caching of
xattr_root entirely or creates in on mount, as the priv root is created. The privroot
must be cached to avoid a deadlock on the fs-root directory's i_mutex, but xattr_root
was cached as an optimzation. If we need to take privroot->i_mutex every time, there's
no point in caching it since it will probably be in the dcache anyway.
