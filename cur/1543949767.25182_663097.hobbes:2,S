This was 2.5.x - you'll need to look in the historical-git tree.
Here it is:

I was very bad about changelogging that one.  I do remember there was a bit
of to-and-fro before we decided to do it this way.  Some googling would be
needed.

iirc gcc was failing to inline functions which we'd marked `inline' and it
was generating poorer code as a result.  It might also have been generating
an out-of-line copy for each compilation unit which called the inline (it
would have to do this?)

yup.
