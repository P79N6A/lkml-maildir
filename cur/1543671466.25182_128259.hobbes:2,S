Depends at what level of optimization you are talking about. I consider a
syscall an expensive operation. The transition from user to kernel mode,
the setup and retrieval of parameters all cost (and some architectures are
worse at it than i386).

That is still quite a few syscalls (and some path walking for each file
descriptor)... I was proposing to get around the syscall overhead which
on large multi-user systems (or webservers running lots of CGI) could be
significant.
Honestly, I'm not sure if it is necessary either. But I can think of a few
advantages (and people on the list have thought of more)... How do
MMU-less archs spawn processes? Do they always use vfork()?
L8r,
