I mean, all by-hand modifications must be in the $(srctree) (let's get
this term), $(objtree) is output *only*. Thus, i would propose to remove
it from the path. Even dynamic SCM mechanism of adding local version
doesn't use `localversion' files.

I know it maybe another my "change it all" proposition, but i can't find
nothing against `GNU $(wildcard ..)' and `unnecessarily complex "find"'.
