I know.  I didn't say there wasn't.  They were all standards  of the X

(Note, however, that there is  a tiny difference in the command layout
between the MIT X protocol specifiaction version 11 and the reality.)

Well, I'm driving my X11 from  /opt/xorg and I don't have any problems
yet. Just  that the NVidia  driver doesn't get  it right, but  I threw
