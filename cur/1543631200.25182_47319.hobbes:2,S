I am having a problem with HT and MTRR on a dual
2.2GHz Xeon system.  After starting X, all operation
is unpredicatable.  I have seen discussions about
cache conflicts with MTRR.  Is there a patch available
for the 2.4.17 kernel?  Is this problem fixed in the
later kernels 2.4.18 and 2.4.19 etc.  Thanks.
Regards,
