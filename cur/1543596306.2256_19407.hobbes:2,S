Subject: [ANNOUNCE] HotPlug CPU patch against 2.4.5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi all,
	
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lhcs/
	Version 0.5 (should actually compile) of the HotPlug CPU Patch
is out.  This adds /sbin/hotplug support (thanks Greg), which is
almost useful.
	Of course, /sbin/hotplug falls far short of allowing you to
stop CPUs from going down or coming up, or do something *before* CPUs
go down or up, and it uses env vars to pass what it's doing, but we've
had worse infrastructure in the kernel *cough*sysctl*cough*.  </rant>
Cheers!
Rusty.
