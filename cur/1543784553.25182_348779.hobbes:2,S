I sould have sed more than just where my syap parttion is
in linux2.6.13/Doucumentation /power/deviecs.txt it says
somethhing about pci bus devices causing problems
with just my sound card modules it just halts with an oops
with pcmcia modules loaded it eats the file system
with the pci bus mouldes unloaded ALL of them it suspends fine
and resumes just fine
this works I can live with this I dont mind that all the pci bus devices
have to be turned off and restarted after resume
what I need is a safe way to reload them
I tryed sleep 5 (this may have been too short ) then rerunning the /etc/rc.d
scripts to reload them it ate my file system
I have an extra file parttion with minum install and  a  tat.bz2 of a fresh
install to recover from  Note (all of this was done from a fresh install 
of slackware 10.1
