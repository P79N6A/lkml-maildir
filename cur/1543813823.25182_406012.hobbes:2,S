Because vfork also sets CLONE_VM and vfork isn't supposed to reset
alternate stack setting.  For vfork that's not a problem, as the parent task
will not continue until the vfork child execve's.  So, if you want to use
CLONE_VM bit, you'd need to use
	if ((clone_flags & (CLONE_VM | CLONE_VFORK)) == CLONE_VM)
		p->sas_ss_sp = p->sas_ss_size = 0;
