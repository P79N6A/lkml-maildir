extra information. I just spent an hour trying to convince this board
to play nice with an ISA PNP AWE64 sound card.
This caused the BIOS to throw its hands in the air and give up
entirely as far as I can see. IRQ conflicts all over the place. Linux
runs; windows manages to start, but can't talk to the scsi card at
all.
And isa-pnp.o in 2.4.0 resulted in a never ending stream of messages
to the console, hanging the machine, like so:
isapnp: unexpected or unknown tag type 0xff ...
Taking the AWE64 out solved the issues. It could be a bust card of
course, but I think the BIOS is stuffed.
cheers,
Phil
