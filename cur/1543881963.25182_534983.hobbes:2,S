NO IT IS NOT!
Yes, you are parroting Pavel, but he can say it a million times, and it's 
*still* not true.
That's like saying "read() is a subset of write(), isn't it?" On many 
devices, they share some of the setup, like writing the same sector 
registers with the same values.
Does that make them subsets of each other?
Or does it mean that they *may* use some of the same common helper 
functions for some devices?
