Thank you Jeff for the SG_IO suggestion. Are there any numbers as to
the average throughput achieved using the SG_IO ioctl. The reason I am
asking is that for our scenario the data transfer throughput required
might not be fulfilled using the SG_IO ioctl due to the SCSI->ATA
translations. In case the SG_IO does not fulfill the requirement,
where should we add IOCTL functionality. At first I was thinking of
adding it to the AHCI driver, but by looking at the code I saw that
the ahci driver only implements functions so that they can be hooked
with the libata framework, so  should I add IOCTL hooks to the
libata?. Please let me know if I am by any chance going completely in
the wrong direction.
Thanks
Mutahir
