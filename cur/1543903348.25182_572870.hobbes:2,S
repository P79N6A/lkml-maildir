Oooh, shiny. We've been talking about how useful this would be for
years. Experience with the unification of PowerPC shows that it's
definitely the right thing to do -- it reduces the number of gratuitous
differences between 32-bit and 64-bit code, and makes it far more easier
to ensure that bug-fixes and new features get added to both at the same
time.
