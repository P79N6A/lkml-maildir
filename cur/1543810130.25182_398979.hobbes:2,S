Isn't this what happend with swusp? I tried it of a period of time when
it was included in mainline, it was just buggy and nothing much
improved.
I totally agree with you that nothing broken should be get into
mainline, but I think that Suspend 2 has be proven to be stable, and it
is worth to put work on it and to fix the remaining issues instead of
just starting from the scratch.
