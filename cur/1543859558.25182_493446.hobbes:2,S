From a usability point of view, it's helpful to power the card down as 
much as possible while it's not being actively used. However, it's also 
helpful to be able to provide a list of available wireless networks, 
though some degree of latency would be acceptable in that. These two 
desires are obviously not entirely compatible with one another, so it 
would be helpful if there was some means of providing an intermediate 
state.

Hm. Does the spec not set any upper bound on how long it might take for 
APs to respond? I'm afraid that my 802.11 knowledge is pretty slim. 
Picking a number out of thin air would be one answer, but clearly less 
than ideal. This may be a case of us not being able to satisfy everyone, 
and so just having to force the user to choose between low power or 
wireless scanning.
