Subject: Do I have some bad compiler/2.2pre4 installation here?

Upgraded my compiler recently as some of the work that I'm doing required an
updated version of egcs to work with.  The upgraded compiler worked fine on
the 2.1.132 kernel that I've got here, so I figured that I'd try compiling
2.2pre4 to try that out.  When I did this I got:
[root@cr535193-a linux-2.2.0pre4]# make menuconfig
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-include scripts/split-include.c
as: error in loading shared libraries
: undefined symbol: __bzero
make: *** [scripts/split-include] Error 1 
Any suggestions as to what it was that got bummed up when I upgraded the
compiler?  "gcc -v" shows:
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.57/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.57 19980901 (egcs-1.1 release)
Ideas?  It's running on a RH5.2 installation, that's why I've only got the
1.1b release of egcs in there; can't find a 1.1.1 that's available in RPM that
would install properly.
