  It sounds as if it may be one of those "it depends" things, but if
current is not calculated the exact same way in all places... people
talk about coloring (or colouring in Canada) and several other things I
forget, it's sort of nice to be sure it's calculated just once, and that
if the calculation becomes more expensive in the future that the
tradeoff between passing and calculating won't change.
  I guess passing is safer for the future and of a known cost.
