Let's see ... Linux-ARM is a "please don't crosspost" list;
but you did (including linux-kernel).  And then you also
posted much the same message to linux-usb-users and then
linux-usb-devel.
In none of these messages do you report what that vendor said
about these problems ...
In short, a good lesson in how NOT to ask for help!
If anyone feels inclined to follow up on this, please do so
only on linux-usb-devel.
