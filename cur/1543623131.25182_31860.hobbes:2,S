An example:
We have a file server with these fs mounted in /mnt
/
+-mnt
|   +-fs1
|   |  +-dir1
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root          121 dic 13 19:47 
file1.txt
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 paul     sales      232121 dic 13 19:47 
file2.txt
|   |  +-dir2
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root        72534 dic 14 20:27 
file1.txt
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 mary     sales        9493 dic 14 20:27 
file2.txt
|   +-fs2
|   |  +-dir1
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root         2312 dic 13 19:55 
other1.txt
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root          232 dic 13 19:55 
other2.txt
|   |  +-dir2
|   |     +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root         2534 dic 14 20:34 
file1.txt
|   |     +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root          493 dic 14 20:54 
file2.txt
|
.
Then, UserA delete /mnt/fs1/dir1/file2.txt and UserB delete 
/mnt/fs1/dir2/file2.txt and create a new one. The state of the file 
server will be:
+-mnt
|   +-fs1
|   |  +-dir1
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root          121 dic 13 19:47 
file1.txt
|   |  +-dir2
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root        72534 dic 14 20:27 
file1.txt
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 UserB    sales        9493 Mar 02 12:22 
file2.txt
|   |  +-.undelete
|   |     +--rw-r--r--    1 paul     sales      232121 dic 13 19:47 
+2001-12-13 19:47:23+dir1+file2.txt
|   |     +--rw-r--r--    1 mary     sales        9493 dic 14 20:27 
+2001-12-14 20:27:44+dir2+file2.txt
|   +-fs2
|   |  +-dir1
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root         2312 dic 13 19:55 
other1.txt
|   |  |  +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root          232 dic 13 19:55 
other2.txt
|   |  +-dir2
|   |     +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root         2534 dic 14 20:34 
file1.txt
|   |     +--rw-r--r--    1 root     root          493 dic 14 20:54

.
I mean:
When a user delete a file, the old version would be moved to .undelete 
directory and renamed:
yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss+directory+from+became+filename.ext
and there would be a '.undelete' directory inside each mounted fs (with 
undelete option in /etc/fstab?).
In this way we can undelete erased files AND complete directory erases.
The date/time attr of the files in 'undelete' directory could be set the 
delete time.
The rwx attr do not change
Another filename version could be:
yyyy-MM-dd 
hh:mm:ss+owner_user+owner_group+rwxrwxrwx+directory+from+became+filename.ext
The date/time attr of the files in 'undelete' directory would have the 
delete time AND the uid/gid would have the uid/gid of the user that 
delete the files, so he/she will have rights to undelete it.
The rwx attr changes to 440 I think...
If the fs does not support long names, then we could to move and rename 
it as file1.txt.1, file1.txt2, etc...
A undelete utility that complete the picture would be usefull.
Sorry my English. ;-)
