Hello,
I've configured my kernel (2.4.13-ac8) to use tmpfs, but it seems that it
only uses half my physical memory (64 of 128MB).
>From Configure/help
/*
    Tmpfs is a file system which keeps all files in virtual memory.
    In contrast to RAM disks, which get allocated a ficed aount of physical
RAM, tmps grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able
to swap unneeded pages out to swap space.
*/
Well, it doesn't grows, neither shrinks, but maybe it's only me because I'm
a newbie with this. How does tmpfs works, and how do I configure it
correctly.
Thank you in advance,
Norberto
