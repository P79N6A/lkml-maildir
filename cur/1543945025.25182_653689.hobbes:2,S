I have a xen domain builder patch as well. I was waiting for the Linux
side to gain some traction before putting it forward (I'd attach it now
but it's at home on a laptop which is sleeping).

Agreed. Probably the same deal as the compression format, i.e. use the
magic number but only ELF is possible today (even less likely to change
than the compression format I guess...).

That's probably a neater way of doing it. Although the ".../header.o:
AFLAGS_header.o" is redundant, either 
	header.o: AFLAGS += foo
or
	AFLAGS_header.o += foo
with the second being preferred in Linux Makefiles I think.
I'll try and get an updated patch out before I head for my flight
tomorrow.
Ian.
