This has come up in the past.
1. Most of the "distribution" is actually code from a totally independant (from
   Linux) project - the FSF Hurd.
2. Linux only refers to the kernel. Not the distribution.
   Most of the utilities (when you get away from device/kernel
   setup/logging/initialization) is from that project.
I believe R. Stallman would prefer that the distributions be referred to
differently (Hurd/linux? That wasn't quite it... I don't remember what he said
specificly). It had to do with the source of most of the things that make a
system work - cp, ls, mkdir, gcc, libc,...  These all come from a different
location, they are not part of Linux, although the Linux kernel is useless
without them.

No distribution is "Linux". That is the name of the kernel. Now it does happen
that I would (personal preference here) have those utilities that are built to
interface directly with the kernel (ifconfig, init, hdparm, ...) to be provided
from the same location as the kernel. That way the dependancies between kernel
and these applications would remain consistant. But.. they arn't. No big deal.
Even these utilities (frequently I understand) come from BSD/netBSD/OpenBSD
(whereever) distributions.
Each distribution appears to be aimed at a specific user base, some larger than
others. These distributions should not be penalized for providing additional
support. After all, that is what they make their money from.
Penalizing distributions for "compliancy" doesn't make sense - Would that also
apply to a specialty hardware vendor that provides a driver? After all, it's not
in the "standard"...
The areas of non-compliancy are usually in specific bug patches, and drivers.
Sometimes even in the compiler used. This IS up to the vendors. They have to
support their customer base, and I have no problem with it. I do believe they
should be documenting the uniqueness better.
As far as I've seen, the distributions accept what are "best practices" from
a variety of places, AT&T System V, BSD, Sun OS 4.x, Sun Solaris 2.x, whereever
something worked, and worked well, it has been adopted. There were/are some
"adjusting" to make it all be relatively seamless; and that is another place
of "compliancy" as well as "if it works cleanly, and well.... then that is
the direction to go".
Linux runs in some systems that are NOT considered a "Unix" environment. It is
still Linux even if it does have custom drivers, and applications.

No. The DAC960 hardware you are using just doesn't happen to be fully supported
by the kernel/raid utilities as provided by vendor X. Since that is a Mylex
board, I would expect it to be available/supported within a few months (weeks?)
of the availability of the hardware. Just because there may be some oddity that
Red Hat has already figured out is no reason to penalize Red Hat - either ask
for the driver separately from Red Hat, or contact the vendor/supplier of the
hardware.... (or the maintainer of the driver...)
