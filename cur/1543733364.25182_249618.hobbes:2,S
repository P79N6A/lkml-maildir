No need to bug the janitors, I created a few patches myself:
  1. Convert all in-kernel users of the deprecated EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS() to
     EXPORT_SYMBOL().
  2. Now all users of the deprecated EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS are gone, ctags
     doesn't have to care about it anymore.
  3. Remove deprecated EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS() support from UML.
  4. Remove deprecated EXPORT_SYMBOL_NOVERS() support completely.
The last patch may be delayed until 2.7 because of backwards compatibility
reasons for out-of-tree drivers.
All patches are untested, but Obviously Correct(TM).
