And then of course the FS is the LOGICAL level of access to the device -
so
if read ahead matters then it's this level where it should happen -
since
this is the place where actual predictability of the next access
(actually
the assumption that the access will happen at least semi-sequentially)
has good
chances to be right. So you are completely right that the page-cache is
the right place where the rahead logic should take place. I have just
filled
the argumentation gap ;-).
