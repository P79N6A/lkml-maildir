Subject: [patch] fix for xtime SMP race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Some days ago I fixed lost_ticks in gettimeofday. But get_fast_time() can
be run inside an irq handler (as in netif_rx()) and cli() is not enough to
protect us from a xtime SMP race.
Let me explain further the scenario. In SMP running only cli() at the top
of do_gettimeofday() is not enough (and it's also too much in all other
cases). This because a cli() will revert to a __cli() if we are just
inside an irq handler (as in the ethernet case).  So we are sure to not be
interrupted in do_gettimeofday() but the irq0 could still run on the other
CPU, the same is true for the timer_bh handler. Note right now 2.1.132 is
perfectly safe in UP. Holding the global_cli is also too much if
gettimeofday is called from userspace since we don' t care if other irqs
will run on the other CPU. We can' t allow irqs to run also on our CPU
only to avoid to lockup recursing on the same rw_spinlock.
Here the patch against 2.1.132 to make get_time_fast() SMP safe:
