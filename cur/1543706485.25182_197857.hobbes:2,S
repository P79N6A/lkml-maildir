how about simply using a shift to output two regular longs, i.e.
printk("%ld%ld",loff_t >> (sizeof(long) * 8), loff_t << sizeof(long) * 8 >>
sizeof(long) * 8);
perhaps you could even place this ghastly code in a macro if you have to access
it often (so that you don't have to look at it :)?
I know it's not pretty, but at least the %ld is considered standard printf
functionality. I don't think %lld (even if it is implemented in some printf
derivates) can be considered portable.
