Mmm...perhaps.

I guess that depends on who you ask. Obviously, for most people the previous 
limit of 1024 devices is more than enough. But there's always going to be 
folks pushing the limits. So I figured I'd go ahead and rewrite it to 
theoretically allow for the maximum range of minor numbers, while trying not 
to waste memory for the common case.

The idr stuff looks promising at first glance. I'll take a better look at it 
tomorrow and see if we can switch from a bit-set to one of these data 
structures.
