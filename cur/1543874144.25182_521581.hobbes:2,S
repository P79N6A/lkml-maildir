I'm not arguing with that.  Why I think RDM is the wrong thing to use is that
there seems to be a perception that RDM involves a unidirectional, single
message transmission.  You yourself defined RDM to be a datagram service.
RxRPC is not, in my opinion, a datagram service, and neither is it a stream
service.
Interestingly, searching for SOCK_RDM definitions with google shows there's
some disagreement as to what it represents.  Some seem to thing it's connection
oriented and some that it's connectionless, and some seem to think it's
ordered, and some not.

Well, I suggest SOCK_RPC, not SOCK_RXRPC.  There's no particular reason such a
flow type has to be limited to RxRPC.

That's your prerogative.

Conversely, you haven't shown that any of the existing types are suitable
either.
Strictly, the "type" parameter for RxRPC family sockets is completely
irrelevant as only one flow type is supported anyway; but still, I'd like to
get it right.
Looking at the socket(2) manpage, I see the definition of the SOCK_RDM to be:
	Provides a reliable datagram layer that does not guarantee ordering.
I'd say that that precludes applicability on two points: firstly, RxRPC is not
a datagram layer by the definition I provided in a previous email; and
secondly, RxRPC *does* provide some ordering guarantees.

I've no way to find out what AIX does, but I suspect it simply doesn't.
The way OpenAFS does things is that it has an RxRPC library that can be
compiled either in userspace or in kernel space.  Userspace AFS utilities use
the userspace-compiled library, which simply uses a UDP socket as its kernel
interface; the kernel code uses the same library, but compiled for existence
within the kernel.
