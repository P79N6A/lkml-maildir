Tracing is one way.
The other way is the old scientific method:
- develop a theory
- add sufficient instrumentation to prove or disprove that theory
- run workload, crunch on numbers
- repeat
Of course, multiple theories can be proven/disproven in a single pass.
Practically, this means adding one new /prov/vmstat entry for each `goto
keep*' in shrink_page_list().  And more instrumentation in
shrink_active_list() to determine the behaviour of swap_tendency.
Once that process is finished, we should have a thorough understanding of
what the problem is.  We can then construct a testcase (it'll be a couple
hundred lines only) and use that testcase to determine what implementation
changes are needed, and whether it actually worked.
Then go back to the real workload, verify that it's still fixed.
Then do whitebox testing of other workloads to check that they haven't
regressed.
