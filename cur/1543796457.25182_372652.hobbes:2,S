The preprocessor /is/ part lof the language...

They do have their uses. No, C (particularly as used today) is not a
"designed" language, it has several ways of doing the same thing, some
quirks, and outright design mistakes.

Then you aren't fit to judge, are you?

"More flexible" == "more leeway to screw up"...

Ditto.

libc is part of the language, as is cpp.

No. The difference between them is not /that/ large, and by now the use of
#define is so much part of the "way things are done" that the pain of
changing it doesn't buy you enough.
What I see is that you don't know too much about large-scale software
development (and Linux is definitively in that league).
