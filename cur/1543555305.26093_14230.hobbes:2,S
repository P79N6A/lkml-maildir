Well, filesystem compresion is in NT since 4.0, in fact you can compress
a file, a directory, or the whole partition, but only under NTFS. I
believe that it's [un]compressed on the fly, but I'm not sure about this
fact.
The [un]compression mechanism could be a kernel thread calling a
userspace program (gzip, bzip2, definable) doing the actual
decompresion.
Don't know, just thoughts.
