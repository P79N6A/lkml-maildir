Sorry, still not convinced. :)
Saying to a user who has just written his new flight simulator which
requires access to /dev/mem "oh no - access to this device is definitely
restricted!" is exactly the same as saying to another user whose new game
needs access to /dev/3dfx "oh no - this device is a security hole, can't
give you access to that!".
No difference, really.
