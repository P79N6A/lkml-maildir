Hello guys,
Why do we need /proc/version if we have that info in
/proc/sys/kernel/version already?
Also, I noticed LEAK_CHECK option (with corresponding bread/brelse) in
isofs. Shouldn't a similar thing be put into all other fs'es (assuming it
can't be done on generic VFS level because we have things like ext2_bread,
ext2_getblk etc etc)?
Regards,
