just for the record, same problem here.
I mean, with my Sony Vaio VGN-SZ1VP (here[1] you can find all hardware
details), it's enough some mega of udp traffic, usually nfs, to "freeze"
the network. Well, no complain from the kernel. It's enough to rmmod and
modprobe sky2 to fix the problem. I already tried -mm1, but nothing
changed. In the meanwhile I will continue to use my usb network card.
Thanks a lot for your time,
Andrea Gelmini
