Actually, this reminds me of a comp.risks passim where one of the filtering
products would censor swearwords out of any downloaded file.  Pick a couple
of random tarballs of the linux source tree and perform
grep -i fuck
on them (and apparently these filters were even less cautious about what
they stripped to be sure of catching `f u c k', etc.)
just tried it on a few I have here, didn't find any, but 2.3.3.tar.bz2
contains `shit'.  I love it when these sort of things fail.
