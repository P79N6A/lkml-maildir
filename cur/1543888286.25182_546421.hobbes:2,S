Is there any way in which we can avoid adding a new page flag?
We have the advantage that if the kernel very occasionally gets the wrong
result for PageReadahead(page), nothing particularly bad will happen, so we
can do racy things.
From a quick peek, it appears that PG_readahead is only ever set against
non-uptodate pages.  If true we could perhaps exploit that: say,
PageReadahead(page) == PG_referenced && !PG_uptodate?
