Hi,
  Ever since the introduction of the new file locking code in 2.4.x,
NFS locking has been seriously broken. A preliminary look seems to
indicate that the problems might lie in the generic locking code: when
running the connectathon tests against another server I get crap like
      panic("Attempting to free lock with active wait queue")
This occurs regularly when running the various child process/parent
process locking tests (essentially those tests which activate the lock
blocking).
  This needs to be fixed before we release the final 2.4.0. I'll see
if I can't find time to look into it myself in the course of the week,
however I'm trying hard not to get too distracted from writing up my
thesis. It would therefore be nice if Willy and/or others familiar
with the file locking could take a look too.
  In the meantime, perhaps Ted could put this issue into his TODO
list?
Cheers,
  Trond
