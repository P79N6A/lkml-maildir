I have a vague recollection of a distinction between /tmp and /var/tmp,
where /tmp was for very small or zero-length files with a short life time,
and /var/tmp was for large or long-life data. That way /tmp could stay on
the root fs, or a small ramdisk, or use tmpfs, without worrying about it
sucking too much space. The problem is that applications would need to know
about this, and AFAIK they don't.
Are we off-topic yet? :)

To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.            --unknown source
