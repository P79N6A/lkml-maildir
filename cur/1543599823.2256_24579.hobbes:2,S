You're so full of shit that it's incredible.
I'mnot going to argue this, when people call stuff like the above the
"natural way". This is not worth it.
The fact is, the way gcc currently does things, -Wsign-compare is useless.
Anybody who is honest would admit that. In order for the warning to become
useful, gcc would need to do value range analysis - which people have been
talking about, but which is not there yet.
There have been some constructive comments here (the automatic detection
of bad comparisons etc), but yours is just stupid.
