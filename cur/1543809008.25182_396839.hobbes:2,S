And look - ide-scsi is going away. So that "new" interface is disappearing.

And only true in those cases, although I have seen (thanks to necessity, not 
choice) that NT (and therefore Win32) does do btl mappings internally at 
least at boot. But if you claim that SPTI or ASPI is necessary to burn CD's 
on windows you are sadly mistaken. There are a number of programs which 
_might_ do ASPI internally, but never export the interface, so how does 
Windows use it? And with XP, again, thanks to necessity (making money in both 
cases) I can easily state that Windows does burning _internally_ without 
ASPI. (which I know doesn't exist because of complaints form WinAmp about the 
same)
