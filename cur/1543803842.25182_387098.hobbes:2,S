	There is already at least 2 KDE applications for WiFi stuff,
and both are fully fledged (i.e. not just a signal meter) :
		
http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdenetwork/wifi/
		
http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/kdenonbeta/kifi/
	Note that I've used neither, so I don't know how good they are
and what features are missing. If you decide to write another apps,
please send me the link so I can add it on my web page.
