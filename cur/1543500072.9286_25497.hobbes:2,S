No, you are NOT allowed to free a locked block. If you do, it's a bug.
The fact that the page is locked implies that it is going to be unlocked
by something later.
And there is not a chance in hell that that "later unlock" can validly
survive through a free_page() -> get_free_page() schenario. 
In short, trying to free a locked page is always a bug.

Your patches will never get applied if you do stuff like that. That's
final.
