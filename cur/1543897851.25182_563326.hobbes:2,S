This is precisely what fE = 0 or ~0 provides.
Recall, an exec()'d program gets its p*' capabilities from a convolution
of its exec()er's inheritable set (pI) *and* the file's capabilities
(fI,fP,fE):
    pI' = pI
    pP' = (X & fP) | (pI & fI)
    pE' = pP' & fE
[Linux essentially has cap_bset for X.]
The fine-grain ability for ping to do its thing without becoming
powerful enough to load a kernel module, for example, is facilitated by
the "pP' &" part of the derivation of pE' (and not simply the unfiltered
value of fE!).
As I said before, either the program knows how to raise and lower bits
in its pE set, or it doesn't. In the former case, fE=0. In the latter
case, fE=~0 will ensure that it gets all of the capabilities it is
permitted to exercise at time of execution.
Could you cite some examples of where this position is unreasonable?
Thanks
Andrew
