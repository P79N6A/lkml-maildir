At the end of this paragraph then mention using CPUID to determine
the presence of the counters. AFAIK, there is no feature bit
covering performance monitoring. Does that mean we are left
with having to check the family and model number just like on
Intel?

Ok, I think I understand now:
	1/ Bios and Kernel Developer Guide from Ahtlon64 and Opteron 64 is
	  what you are talking about with K7/K8
	2/ AMD64 Architecture Programmer's Manual is the generic AMD64 description
So in theory, we should have:
	- a generic PMU description for the architected PMU  as described in 2/
	- a K7/K8 PMU description table for Athlon64 and Opteron64 as described in 1/
AFAIK, K7/K8 do not add anything to the architected PMU. I'll rename what we have to perfmon_k8.c
to make it more explicit.
