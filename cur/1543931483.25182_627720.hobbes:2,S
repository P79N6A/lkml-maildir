I agree, *some* form of FMR support is important for iSER (and probably
for NFS over RDMA as well). Rather than adding a crippled NO FMR
mode it would make more sense to add support for FMR Work Requests.
I'm not certain what, if any, impact that would have on the Power5 problem,
but that's certainly a cleaner path for iWARP.
