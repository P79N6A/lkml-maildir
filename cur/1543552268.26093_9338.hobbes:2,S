Until actively connecting client will send some data,
service will and must retransmit syn-ack. Otherwise you will lose connection.
DEFER_ACCEPT (like data_ready filter) applies only
to sessions, which expect some data from client as beginning
of transaction. F.e. HTTP.

It is rounded up to 3*2^N seconds.
