You definitely got that one right. But we would prefer to a working 
scheduler over a broken one.

Ok. As you note below this wont do too much good.

Right. Lets put this in as a temporary measure and then well try to get to 
a long term solution that avoids doing N^2 searches in the kernel.

Ok. Lets see what others say.

Ok. That would work.

Too contorted and too difficult to use. Having a cpu field in 
/proc/<pid>/cpu is self explanatory, easy to understand and allows
per process control for the user space mechanism. Could also be used
to test things or to manually intervene in the scheduler.
Transferring an abstract number of processes from one cpu to another is 
rare. One strives to have one process per cpu.

Ok.
