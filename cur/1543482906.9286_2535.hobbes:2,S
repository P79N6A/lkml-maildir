I've got a P6DNF motherboard here with dual Pentium Pros on it. I get
quite a few of that, but it seems to be relatively harmless (so far)
It's been up and running for the last 24 hours now, seems to be fairly
rock solid apart from the ptrace()/ummap() bug which will get fixed within
the next few days or so. =)
Cheers,
Alex
