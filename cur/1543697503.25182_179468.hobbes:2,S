Can you enable DEBUG in "arch/i386/pci/pci.h" and ACPI debugging and then
report what the system says at bootup both with ACPI enabled, and with 
"pci=noacpi".
For some reason the system decides that your IDE controller is on irq3,
which is clearly wrong. It's on irq15, but somebody told the PCI layer
otherwise.
