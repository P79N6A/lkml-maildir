Forgive me if I'm being naive, but...
Why can't synaptics be transparent? Why can't it do all the stuff it
requires special userspace things for in kernel space?
I should think that mapping the scroll buttons to their normal PS/2
equivalents on a Synaptics touchpad is possible in kernel space.
A friend recently expressed his discontent with this condition when he
tried to plug in another mouse and use it while the Synaptics touchpad was
still present.
So, please enlighten me...
