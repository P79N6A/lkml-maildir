For patch 1, I'm not to keen on the:
  +#ifdef CONFIG_AVR32
  +       port->flags |= UPF_IOREMAP;
  +       port->membase = ioremap(pdev->resource[0].start,
  +                               pdev->resource[0].end
  +                               - pdev->resource[0].start + 1);
  +#else
part.  It might be better to pass a flag (in the platform_data
structure) whether we are providing a virtual or a physical address.
(If you want early init on the serial console, then I recommend just
using a static mapping for the DBGU peripheral).
Patch 2 & 3 look correct, but they would need to be tested.
