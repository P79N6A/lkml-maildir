Hi all,
attached is a patch for 2.4.19-pre8 which fixes Config.in
entry for "HP ZX1 AGP Support".
This is also shown in arches != ia64, but this is wrong.
Attached patch fixes it and applies clean ontop 2.4.19-pre8.
This is also CC'ed to Marcello. Please apply it!
If this was reported before, i don't get it.
