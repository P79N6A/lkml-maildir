I'm doing my best to track this thread altough I cannot understand the
technical stuff I belive you are havily tracking down a bug in the
ohci-hcd, but, according to the problems I expierienced, there is a 
similar bug in uhci-hcd.

    Subsystem: NEC Corporation: Unknown device 815e
    Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 0, IRQ 9

When there is any further information you need, or any extra testing
that needs to be done, please tell me and I'll be happy to help out. 
Keep up the good work!
