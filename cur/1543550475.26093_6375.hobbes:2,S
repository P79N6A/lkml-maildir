You were not mentioned in this context from Dan.  These statements came from
someone else up there who called me on his cell phone after sitting in a meeting
with some folks.  Apparently, there was a third party of some sort involved.  I am
only speculating, but letting it die would be best.  I have no idea what you said
to them outside of the email you copied me on.  I only know what they communicated
to me.
