How can a debugger, newly attached to an arbitrary thread, determine whether
the thread has a pending exit futex and associated memory location to clear
[CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID flag and child_tid_ptr parameter at __clone()]?
If so, then how can the debugger determine the address, change the address,
cancel the futex, and/or intercept the notification?
