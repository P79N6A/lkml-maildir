If the page really is clean, then why the heck cant' we just clean the 
page table bits too?
Either it's clean or it isn't. If all the buffers being clean means that 
the page is clean, then it's clean. WE SHOULD NOT THINK THAT PTE'S ARE ANY 
DIFFERENT.
I really don't see your point. Is it clean? If it is, then clear the damn 
dirty bits from the page tables too. Don't go pussyfooting around the 
issue and confuse yourself and everybody but me by saying "but if it's 
dirty in the page tables, it's magically dirty". NO.
It really is that simple. Is it clean or not?
If it's clean, you can remove ALL the dirty bits. Not just some.
