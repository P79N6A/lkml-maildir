Actually, the least costly way should be to make the "ADDR" define work 
right again.
It used to do something magic like
	struct fake_area {
		unsigned long members[1000];
	};
	#define ADDR (*(volatile struct fake_area *)addr)
which was correct. I forget why it got broken into using just a "long *" 
(it happened a long long time ago).
