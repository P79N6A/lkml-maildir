Hi Luke,
Haven't seen you since I believe you gave a somewhat interesting talk
on FUSE at an OxLUG a year or more back. I don't think anyone here is
selectively deaf, but some might just ignore you for such comments :-)

There was some general bollocks about Andrew being burned out, but
that wasn't what the point was as far as I saw it - more about how
things could be better streamlined than a sudden panic moment.

Whoever said it was?

I don't think anyone with moderate grasp of the English language won't
have understood what you wrote above. They might not understand why
you said it, but that's another issue.

But you /know/ this because you're a microprocessor designer as well
as a contributor to the FUSE project?

I think there are many possible reasons for that and I doubt slashdot
will reveal any of those reasons. The main issue (as I understand it)
is that SMT/SMP is taking off for many applications and manufacturers
want to cater for them while reducing heat output - so they care less
about MHz than about potential real world performance.

Yes. Wow! Of course! Whoda thunk it? I mean, parallel processing!
Let's get that right into the kern...oh wait, didn't Alan and a bunch
of others already do that years ago? Then again, we might have missed
all of the stuff which went into 2.2, 2.4 and then 2.6?

Wow! Really? I seem to have missed /all/ of those annoying ads. But
please tell me some more about it!

Why? I happen to think Microkernels are really sexy in a Computer
Science masturbatory kind of way, but Linux seems to do the job just
fine in real life. Do we need to have this whole
Microkernel/Monolithic conversation simply because you misunderstood
something about the kind of performance now possible in 2.6 kernels as
compared with adding a whole pointless level of message passing
underneath?
Jon.
