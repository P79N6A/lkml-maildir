Can you expand on that?  Why do we need such a bitmap?
Would an idr tree be more appropriate?

In that case it looks rather 64-bit-unfriendly.  A 32-bit compiler will lay
that structure out differently from a 64-bit compiler.  Or not.  Hard to
say.  Perhaps something more defensive is needed here.
One other thing: the patch adds 16 bytes to struct inode, for a feature
which many users and most inodes will not use.  Unfortunate.
Is it possible to redesign things so that those four new fields are in a
standalone struct which points at the managed inode?  Joined at the hip
like journal_head and buffer_head?
Bonus marks for not having a backpointer from the inode to the new struct ;)
(Still wondering what those timers are doing in there, btw)
