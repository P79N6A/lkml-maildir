It's the same for me  w/ 2.2.18pre15. The box is a 256MB RAM 400Mhz
Celeron doing fileserving w/ ~40 active connections, 5MBytes/s sustained
traffic on eth0, having 4 UDMA used IDE disks w/ sw RAID. Some other
fonctions are also there (Lotus Notes 5.0, squid), might this be a problem
w/ too many processes and fs load, or what?
