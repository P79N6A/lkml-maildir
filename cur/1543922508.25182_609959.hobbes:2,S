Thanks, Jiri, now RLIMIT_DATA works as expected.
Using only RLIMIT_AS to limit processes' memory usage is not
very easy.  It includes also libraries mapped read-only,
I have to check/modify the limits when I update/add
libraries,...
Amazingly, I found a patch which seems to be just what I need:

Seems like that is not going to -mm or mainstream...
