/dev/mem is used for all sorts of sane things including DMIdecode.
Tainting on it isn't terribly useful. Mind you this whole user taint
patch seems bogus as it can only be set by root owned processes so
doesn't appear to do the job it is intended for - perhaps Ted can
explain ?
What X needs btw is mmap on PCI mmio bars, teach the X mapping code to
use those instead of /dev/mem is a simple matter of coding as the right
abstractions are in the tree already.
It would need the kernel to also provide a /dev/isa mapping however.
