You are correct, this does break for bridges on certain architectures.
Some archs seem to re-read the interrupt pin value in
pcibios_enable_device, but others don't.  Adding pci_read_irq to the
bridge patch in this function does seem to fix the problem, and arch
specific code can still override this.  I'll send a new patch for that.
thanks,
