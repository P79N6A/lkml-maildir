There at least two other places where the kernel uses an int instead
of an size_t (unsigned). I think we've been lucky so far that nothing
bad has happened and for various reason that these other places
haven't caused problems... glibc2 has the right API but libc5
doesn't.
I think I'll look at getting some patches for these two other places
out later today... I don't think anything will break and it might
save us some grief.
