So here's an iconoclastic question or two:
  Why can't clients sort the list in userland, before they call down to
the kernel?
  If clients are sorting their lists, why would we need to sort the same
list on the server side. Detecting out-of-order list entries is much
less of a hassle than actually sorting, so if the protocol calls for
sorted elements, you can return an EINVAL or something in the case where
some client sends an unsorted list.
Cheers,
  Trond
