I seem to remember a discussion a year or so ago about there being some
inherantly unsolvable problems with allowing userland to handle nfs
locking. On the other hand, my memory is well known for being buggy. :-)
I also don't think the difference in speed is due to threading alone, the
improvements in speed for a single request is enormous, with knfsd we are
able to saturate a 10Mbit link, unfsd was not even close.
