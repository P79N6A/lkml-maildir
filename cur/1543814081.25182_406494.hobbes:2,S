Hi Mike, Hi Ingo,
thank you both for your insights. I *will* test this, I don't know when
because I'm terribly busy, but I'm really interested.
Ingo, to reply to your question, the typical workload was around 30 Mbps with
1500-2000 sessions/s on a small number of processes (1 to 4*#CPUs). It was
with some kernels around 2.6.8 IIRC. Pauses could be of several hundreds of
milliseconds which was very annoying. But IIRC, if renicing the process(es)
improved SSH responsiveness, it also hurt the service's responsiveness.
The same process running on 2.2, 2.4, solaris 8/10, freebsd and openbsd does
not exhibit the behaviour at all. I've not retried yet with more recent
kernels, I just recently retried the proof of concept I developped at this
date, and all I remember was that 2.6.15+ was really better.
Cheers,
Willy
