Greetings.
Since using 2.4.16 I have been seeing the following message in syslog
from time to time:
scsi0: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr = 0x7
scsi0: Data Parity Error Detected during address or write data phase
>From time to time that 0x7 is an 0x9 and I don't know the meaning of
either of them. :)
These messages appear on my home machine and my work machine, both of
which are 2.4.16 running on a KT7A motherboard.  Work machine has an
Adaptec 29160 controller and home machine has a 2930 controller.

Any ideas?  I really don't like the SCSI controller sharing an interrupt
with anyone but I can't seem to force it to be in its own land.
