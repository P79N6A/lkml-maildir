NAK.
1. It lets any user DOS the system.
2. Your definition of "fatal" signals is wrong. Several of these
   signals can be caught, and user-space sometimes does that for
   good reason. FPE and SEGV are definitely often caught, BUS and
   ILL may be caught, and I suspect TRAP to be common in debugging
   sessions.
3. It puts policy in the kernel. Policy decisions belong in user-space.
   In this case, the policy decision is whether this type of logging
   is desired for a given process or not.
4. If this is about detecting the loss of specific processes
   (network services say), then the problem can be solved in
   user-space by using a separate monitor process, or by
   controlling the processes via ptrace.
At a minimum, the logging needs to be conditionalised on a
per-process setting, and it should also be delayed until the
point where a signal causes a process to be killed.
