Not on a Pentium.
But I quote (from the PPro manual):
 "The only enhancement in the PentiumPro processor is the added support
  for speculative reads and store-buffer forwarding,  .."
A Pentium is a in-order machine, without any of the interesting
speculation wrt reads etc. So on a Pentium you'll never see the problem.
But a Pentium is also very uninteresting from a SMP standpoint these days.
It's just too weak with too little per-CPU cache etc..
This is why the PPro has the MTRR's - exactly to let the core do
speculation (a Pentium doesn't need MTRR's, as it won't re-order anything
external to the CPU anyway, and in fact won't even re-order things
internally).
