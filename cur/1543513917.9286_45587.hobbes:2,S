	Opppsss...  Ssssooorrryyy...  S.O. walked in wearing new dress
to show me.  During confusion resulting from the distraction, message
got sent with no intelligent engaged at the time of delivery...  :-)
When I realize that I had hit the wrong key, I jumped to switch the power
off to the ISDN modems...  Too late...
	One of these days I WILL learn that I operate a preemptive
multitasking kernel that occasionally has problems with data integrity.
Though shalt NOT try to communicate with via E-Mail while being
distracted by one's Significant Other.  E-Mail tends to loose coherency.
