When things have matured, might not be a bad idea to default to using
barriers.

Don't confuse TCQ and barriers, it has nothing to do with each other for
IDE. I can't imagine any chipsets having problems with a syncronize
cache command.

No, for scsi it's a low level driver issue. IDE chipset 'drivers' really
aren't anything but setup stuff, and maybe a few hooks to deal with dma.
All the action is in the ide core.
