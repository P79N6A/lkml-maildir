I tried to find such a sequence, but I think its more a matter of hardware 
evolution, and some degenerated cases.
In some years (months ?), it might possible to starve say the file struct 
spinlock of a process in a open()/close() infinite loop. This because the 
number of instruction per 'memory cache line transfert between cpus/core' is 
raising.
But then one can say its a bug in user code :)
Another way to starve kernel might be a loop doing settime() , since seqlock 
are quite special in serialization :
Only seqlock's writers perform atomic ops, readers could be starved because of 
some hardware 'optimization'.

Maybe some *big* NUMA machines really want this fairness (even if it cost some 
cycles as pointed by Davide in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/29/246
 ) , I am 
just guessing since I cannot test such monsters. I tested Davide program on a 
Dual Opteron and got some perf difference.
