A warning is given if the systen knows the correct way how to deal with the
situation, even if it shouldn't be there. How would you know that any system
being at the compiled-in default root device location (e.g. /dev/sda1, if I
did not have raid) WILL NOT boot unless I intend it to boot? Maybe it's a
rescue system supposed to run from initrd only? Or a public terminal
supposedly running from initrd + network only, where /dev/sda is the
client's USB stick? Or it's a remote setup, and panic() will reboot into the
old, working setup?
