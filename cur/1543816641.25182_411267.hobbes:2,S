So we don't currently save the scsi_lun anywhere.  We, er, translate it
into a 32-bit int, and carry that around.  Obviously this is going to
have to change for things like iSCSI, but this is totally offtopic for
your patch.  So I agree with you, whoever adds the 64-bit LUN support
gets to patch the ioctl struct too.
