you are assuming direct observation. Sure, a human (normally) doesnt 
notice smaller than say 10-20 msec of lag. But, a human very much 
notices indirect effects of latencies, such as the nasty 'click' a 
soundcard produces if it overruns.

a couple of msecs easily even on fast boxes. Well over 10 msecs on 
slower boxes.
