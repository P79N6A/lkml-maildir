Subject: IDE-GUY needs a virtual hosted WEB PAGE

Greetings ALL,
If there is someone out there that would give a virtual host page with the
ablity to list patch code for general access.  Will agree to limited junk
advertisement and will split revenues with ISP/VHWP for vendors that wish
to advertise related material.
IDE/ATAPI/ULTRADMA
harddisk/cdrom/tape/floppy/ls120
controllers/adapters/mainboards
I am changing locations and I will need a new home for the general
UPDATES and information.
Please accept this apology for the minor abuse of the development list,
but finding a new home for this material until it is finalized into both
kernel trees is important.
