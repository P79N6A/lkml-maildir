Hi
I'm trying to backup files from an ext3-partition via dump. The 
backup-drive is an USB 2.0 disk.
After a few minutes I get an error (with -pre3 to -pre5):
kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
kernel: usb.c: USB disconnect on device 00:02.2-1 address

kernel: usb-storage: host_reset() requested but not implem
ented
kernel: scsi: device set offline - command error recover f
ailed: host 1 channel 0 id 0 lun 0
kernel: SCSI disk error : host 1 channel 0 id 0 lun 0 retu
rn code = 6050000
kernel:  I/O error: dev 08:01, sector 46990
The same procedure works fine with 2.4.21, so I guess there's a problem 
with the new USB-code (2.4.21-ac4 doesn't work also, a bug in ehci 
kills the entire machine with an "Oops").
Please CC me, thanks.
