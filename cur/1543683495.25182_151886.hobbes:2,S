Too little context to determine where it goes wrong.
I tried with tcsh here with success.
Try the followings steps:
1) Do not compile as root. In general does as little as possible as root.
Only the kernel installlation requires root priviliges.
2) Try to run "make -n", that may hint where is goes wrong.
3) Do not locate the kernel src in /usr/src/linux - it will conflict with
glibc header files. No matter what a HOWTO say otherwise.
4) Try another shell, for instance bash.
Not that the kernel build should rely on bash only, but an approach to
get your kernel to compile.
