Simple answer: invalidate_mapping_pages(page->mapping, start, end).
Problem: races.  If you pick a random page up off the LRU and start playing
with its mapping, what stops that mapping from getting freed under your
feet?
If the caller has a ref on the inode (say, you came in via a syscall
against an fd) then fine.
But if you picked the page up off the LRU then to avoid super-rare oopses
you'll need to pin the address_space somehow.  One way is to
a) lock the page, which pins the address_space.
b) check that page->mapping is still non-NULL.  Bale if it is.
c) bump page->mapping->host->i_count
d) unlock the page
e) diddle away with the address_space.
f) iput() the inode.
But beware that iput() can do a *ton* of stuff, so you need to be not
holding any locks and to not be called from any fancy contexts.
