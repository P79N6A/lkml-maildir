Yup.  Last I heard, Tejun has fixed this, and queued the code
for 2.6.22 via James B.   But this could be considered a rather
nasty regression in 2.6.21, in that it does seem to cause
significant and unnecessary wear and tear on the drive mechanisms.
I'll patch it locally on my own machines, but what about the tens
of thousands of other Seagate notebook drive owners out there?
