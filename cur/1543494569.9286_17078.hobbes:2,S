Ah yes. Thanks. Now I am using HINT hacked by me to work only in the swap
and it gives better performances dropping the swap cache directly (ask me
privately to see the graph).

Yes, it doesn't do a COW, but it has a cost anyway (and right now we
get_free_page and free_page in the no-COW case too).
I'll reput the !write_acess back here too just because seems to make tons
of sense, even if with such logic my 70mbyte of swap are too low for
128mbyte of RAM, at least while running the bw_mem rd test... :(
Thanks.
