The current code that I posted assumes one preferred_wakeup_cpu per
partitioned domain.  Moving the variable to root_domain is a good idea
for this implementation.
In future when we need one preferred_wakeup_cpu per node per
partitioned domain, we will need a array for each partitioned domain.
Having the array in root_domain is better than having it in dattr.
Depending upon experimental results, we may choose to have only one
preferred_wakeup_cpu per partitioned domain.  When the system
utilisation is quite low, it is better to move all movable tasks from
each node to a selected node (0).  This will freeup all CPUs in other
nodes.  Just that we need to consider cache hotness and cross-node
memory access more carefully before crossing a node boundary for
consolidation.
