I think that truly seamless rebinding is doable but would require too 
much additional complexity in the kernel.  Rebinding to a new id table 
between unregister() ... register() pairs, or between mod unload and mod 
load, should be enough to be useable for 98% of the cases.
It should be noted that David Hinds' pcmcia-cs package stores id in an 
external database.  There are both positive and negative lessons that 
have been learned from that experience (WRT external id tables only! 
:):)) too.

Indeed :/  There are also issues like vendors who want to GPG-sign 
drivers, and updating the PCI id table makes the GnuPG signature and the 
certification that goes along with it invalid, requiring a vendor update.
