HI All,
     I'm not sure if this is the place to raise this issue about
configuring the ISDN card but I'll try anyway or if some could point me in
the right direction. Thanks to all those who helped me I finally found out
my card was a Datalink but that is as far as I managed to get. I managed to
lay my hands on some drivers for the dynalink card built against 2.2.12. I
tried to load these using modprobe hisax but this just comes pack with
/lib/modules/2.2.12/misc/isdn.o: init_module: Device or resource busy
isdn: No such file or directory
however dmesg shows

I have read the all the documentation I can find such as the documents
bundleed with the soure code and also the FAQ supplied with isdn4k-utils.
Can anyone help or pointme somewhere more appropiate to point this
question? TIA
Rus
