Thanks for the great work, Tuukka!  :)
I've  just   tried  it.   I   loaded  'psmouse'  and   'mousedev'  and
/proc/bus/input/devices does show the PS/2 AUX port being treated as a
mouse  device,   handled  by  'mousedev'.    Then,  I  start   gpm  on
/dev/misc/isa0060_serio1, and it works successfully.  The mouse device
disappears from /proc/bus/input/devices.  When  I kill gpm, the kernel
gets  control   again  and  the   mouse  device  shows  up   again  in
/proc/.../devices.

It now works in sysfs.
        $ cat /sys/class/misc/psaux/dev 
        10:1
        $ cat /sys/class/misc/isa0060_serio1/dev 
        10:63

Works fine on mine, too.

This is wonderful!  Or consider  my serio_switch patch.  We don't need
to want for  2.6.10 when they would eventually  add that together with
the sysfs interface.

On my system X and gpm do live with each other without conflicts, both
accessing  /dev/psaux  (either  on  2.4 or  2.6+SERIO_USERDEV).   Both
programs  can detect  VT  switching  and close  the  port when  losing
"focus".

That's a part of the design  of the whole serio subsystem.  Unless the
design is reworked, you can't  do much about it.  The basic assumption
is: each port can be connected  to only one device, whether the device
is in kernel  or userland.  That our SERIO_USERDEV  allows userland to
overhear (O_RDONLY) the traffic is a special bonus feature.
