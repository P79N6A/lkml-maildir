while trying to build a fresh kernel for my mini after upgrading from gutsy
(and forgetting to save my .config) I hit the below build error
2.6.23-rc3 I did work under feisty but that is with a different .config
so not sure if that makes any difference or not
I've not bisected cause it takes so long on this computer...
attached is the config I'm working off now
