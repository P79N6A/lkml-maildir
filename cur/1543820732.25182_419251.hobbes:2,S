Except there are a few things you can't use in user space now, like
connectors, without including a kernel header file.  So, should apps
duplicate the structures and definitions in each and every application and
hopefully notice when the kernel API changes?  Seems painful.
Plus, do we really want Apache or other licensed software directly
including GPL header files?  Oh what a tangled web we weave when we suck
GPL headers into other applications.
Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
