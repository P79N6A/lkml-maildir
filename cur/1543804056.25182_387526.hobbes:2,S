Subject: [PATCH] tvec_bases too large for per-cpu data
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

With internal Xen-enabled kernels we see the kernel's static per-cpu
data area
exceed the limit of 32k on x86-64, and even native x86-64 kernels get
fairly
close to that limit. I generally question whether it is reasonable to
have
data structures several kb in size allocated as per-cpu data when the
space
there is rather limited.
The biggest arch-independent consumer is tvec_bases (over 4k on 32-bit
archs,
over 8k on 64-bit ones), which now gets converted to use dynamically
allocated
memory instead.
