No, if we were to add a NULL check in kmem_cache_free(), it should
behave like kfree() does. Anyway, if you feel about this strongly I
suspect the best solution is to add a __kmem_cache_free which does
_not_ have the NULL check and convert those super-hot paths to use it.
Sort of what Andrew suggested already.
