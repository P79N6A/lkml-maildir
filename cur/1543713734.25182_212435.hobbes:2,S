Precisely. That's why I ended up adding this in cpu_down!!
+	/* Ensure that we are not runnable on dying cpu */

I restore the mask though (under covers of lock_cpu_hotplug) before
returning from cpu_down. Task should never see this violated affinity.
Rusty,
	What do you think abt the whole patch? It has withstood 
my stress-test harness :-)
