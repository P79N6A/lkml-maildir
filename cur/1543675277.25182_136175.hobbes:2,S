Okay. I can now verify the problem. There are two problems as this

As you can clearly see, access time (atime) is not changed.
However, both ctime and mtime are both changed with every
FIFO access. Since this FIFO is provably on a R/O file system,
nothing should change.
Now, somebody will probably claim that this is the correct
POSIX defined behavior <sigh> so you might have to make some
work-around like use a pipe or socket instead of the FIFO??
