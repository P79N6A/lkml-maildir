I found the following solution for the same problem:
- use standard 3c59x driver from kernel sources (even for 3c90x cards)
- load this driver as a kernel module
- add the following entry in /etc/modules:
 ---- cut ----
 3c59x options=0x408
 ---- cut ----
Wake-on-lan works properly now with 3com 905cx-tx-m card (3c905c) on my 
Debian 3.1 (unstable) and 2.6.10 kernel
