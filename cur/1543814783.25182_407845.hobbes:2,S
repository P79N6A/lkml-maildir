Jeff,
For some reason, while I was writing this email, I knew you would be the first
to reply. LOL. Anyway. Does this need new patches sent to LKML or nice
commands to make this work or any idea if stock cpufreqd should manage the
cores separatelly? I haven't got that to work on 2.6.15 so far. How flexible
can we get with the cores?
Thanks for your time,
.Alejandro
