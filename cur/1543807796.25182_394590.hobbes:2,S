I've been wondering about dmraid.  I considered buying an adaptec sata raid
(hardware).  One of the drawbacks on hardware raid is the format isn't
compatible with any other card (or rather manufacturer).  So the question
is, has anyone written anything that can detect and activate disks from a
hardware raid controller when they are placed on a controller w/o any raid?
basically what I mean is, 3 disks, raid5 was in a system with hardware raid. 
the raid card blows up and cannot get another one so to get the data back,
place disks in another machine or on a standard controller and use software
raid or whatever to recover the data.
