We won't in the future.

I'm not sure.  The core moves the device to dpm_active only after ->resume()
has run.  Thus, if ->resume() registers new children, the ordering of
dpm_active will be wrong.

Hmm, yes, we can do it this way.

Well, I misunderstood indeed.

I'm not sure if we need to do it.  It's always been like this, so the current
drivers' ->suspend() and ->resume() don't unregister the device they're called
for.  I don't see any advantage from doing that for future drivers.

Yes, it does.
