Yes, this sounds like a path forward that has a reasonable chance of
making progress.

Yes, I think at one point I have seen all of the major parties receptive
to the concept.

The networking is hard simply because the is so very much of it, and it
is being active developed :)

Yes.  I think we agree on what the semantics should be for these parts.
Which should avoid the problem with have with the pid namespace.

Sounds like a plan.
