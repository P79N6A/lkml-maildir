Unfortunately that addition was half-baked, and introduced security
holes. Linus has been sent patches to fix this; it's probably time to
pester him again.

POSIX is just an API; it doesn't tell you how to design a
kernel. Generally Linux directly implements POSIX features because
that is simpler, but for POSIX threads it's worth stepping back and
asking what it really needs from the kernel. My opinion is that doesn't
include pid sharing and tids.
