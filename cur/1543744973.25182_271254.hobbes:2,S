 Interesting -- your local APIC seems to be disabled by the firmware
(otherwise it would work even without my fix), so how can an I/O APIC
work?  Bringing it up requires a set of tables in memory describing its
configuration to have been prepared by the firmware by means of either the
MPS or the ACPI standard.  Disabling the local APIC likely implies no 
explicit support for APICs is present in the firmware, so such tables 
should be absent.

 With no APIC messages at all it's hard to decide whether it's correct or 
not.

 Someone wasn't as much fond of them as you are and they were removed by
default.  I'm pissed off, too, but my opinion doesn't matter -- others
seem to have better skills with their crystal balls.  Please try "debug
apic=debug" on your command line together with the following patch (the
"apic=" parameter suffers from the same problem "lapic" and "nolapic"  
do, but IMO it would be an overkill to move it to parse_cmdline_early()).
 If you send me the bootstrap log back I may have a look to see what's 
wrong about the I/O APIC.
