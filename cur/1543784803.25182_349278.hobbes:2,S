You'll need some minimal 32-bit libraries sitting around in order
to build it, sorry.
For performance reasons alone I would _never_ condone a purely
64-bit userland.  It's simply a total lose from a performance
perspective, unlike some other platforms such as amd64 which
eradicate most of the 64-bit performance loss due to the gain
in available cpu registers compared to 32-bit x86.
