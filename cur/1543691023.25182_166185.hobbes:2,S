Subject: Is there a patch to make nvnet work ?

I know this driver is closed-source and not supported, but with older kernel 
the 2.6-test5, it works with a patch which could be found here :
http://penna.dyn.dhs.org/nvnet.2.5-1.diff
It works until kernel 2.6-test4-mm4 for me
But there is many changes in structures with 2.6-test5
Today, I try to compile test5-mm2 : it compiles well
I started it and try to compile nvnet against it.
The boot process work without problem.
But when I try to compile it with the last patch, it complains about 
structures.
So I would like to know if there is a new patch which works well with the new 
kernel structures ?
thx
