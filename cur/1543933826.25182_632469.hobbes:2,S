This early boot time hang is *almost certainly* due to the in/out port 
80 bug, which I discovered a few weeks ago, which affects hwclock and 
other I/O device drivers on a number of HP/Compaq machines in exactly 
this way.  The proper fix for this bug is in dispute, and will probably 
not occur in the 2.6.24 release because it touches code in many, many 
drivers.  The simplest way to test if you have a problem of this sort is 
to try this shell line as root, after you boot successfully.  If your 
machine hangs hard,  you have a problem that really looks like the port 
80 problem.
for ((i = 0; i < 1000; i = i + 1)); do cat /dev/nvram > /dev/null; done
I have also attached a c program that only touches port 80.  Compile it 
for 32-bit mode (see comment), run it as root, and after two or three 
runs, it will hang a system that has the port 80 bug.
If you then run:
dmidecode -s baseboard-manufacturer
dmidecode -s baseboard-product-name
are the values you should plug into the .matches field in the 
dmi_system_id struct in the attached patch. It would be great if you 
could do that, test, and post back with those values so they can be 
accumulated.  HP/Compaq machines with quanta m/b's are very popular, and 
very common - so at least a quirk patch for all the broken models would 
be worth doing in 2.6.25 or downstream in the distros.  The right 
patches will probably take a long time - there is a dispute as to what 
the semantics of port 80 writes even mean among the core kernel 
developers, because the hack is lost in the dim dark days of history, 
and safe resolution will take time
There is also a C1E issue with the BIOS in my machine (an HP Pavilion 
dv9000z).  I don't know if it is a bug, yet, but that's a different 
problem - associated with dynticks, perhaps.  I have to say that 
researching the AMD Kernel/BIOS docs on C1E (a very new feature in the 
last year on AMD) leaves me puzzled as to whether the dynticks problem 
exists on my machine at all, but the patch for it turns off dynticks!

commit c12c7a47b9af87e8d867d5aa0ca5c6bcdd2463da
Author: Rene Herman <rene.herman@gmail.com>

    x86: provide a DMI based port 0x80 I/O delay override.
    Certain (HP) laptops experience trouble from our port 0x80 I/O delay
    writes. This patch provides for a DMI based switch to the "alternate
    diagnostic port" 0xed (as used by some BIOSes as well) for these.
    David P. Reed confirmed that port 0xed works for him and provides a
    proper delay. The symptoms of _not_ working are a hanging machine,
    with "hwclock" use being a direct trigger.
    Earlier versions of this attempted to simply use udelay(2), with the
    2 being a value tested to be a nicely conservative upper-bound with
    help from many on the linux-kernel mailinglist, but that approach has
    two problems.
    First, pre-loops_per_jiffy calibration (which is post PIT init while
    some implementations of the PIT are actually one of the historically
    problematic devices that need the delay) udelay() isn't particularly
    well-defined. We could initialise loops_per_jiffy conservatively (and
    based on CPU family so as to not unduly delay old machines) which
    would sort of work, but still leaves:
    Second, delaying isn't the only effect that a write to port 0x80 has.
    It's also a PCI posting barrier which some devices may be explicitly
    or implicitly relying on. Alan Cox did a survey and found evidence
    that additionally various drivers are racy on SMP without the bus
    locking outb.
    Switching to an inb() makes the timing too unpredictable and as such,
    this DMI based switch should be the safest approach for now. Any more
    invasive changes should get more rigid testing first. It's moreover
    only very few machines with the problem and a DMI based hack seems
    to fit that situation.
    An early boot parameter to make the choice manually (and override any
    possible DMI based decision) is also provided:
    	io_delay=standard|alternate
    
    This does not change the io_delay() in the boot code which is using
    the same port 0x80 I/O delay but those do not appear to be a problem
    as tested by David P. Reed. He moreover reported that booting with
    "acpi=off" also fixed things and seeing as how ACPI isn't touched
    until after this DMI based I/O port switch leaving the ones in the
    boot code be is safe.
    
    The DMI strings from David's HP Pavilion dv9000z are in there already
    and we need to get/verify the DMI info from other machines with the
    problem, notably the HP Pavilion dv6000z.
    
    This patch is partly based on earlier patches from Pavel Machek and
    David P. Reed.
