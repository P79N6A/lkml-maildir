Hi Linus,
Please do a
	bk pull bk://drm.bkbits.net/drm-2.6
This will include the latest DRM changes and will update the following files:
 drivers/char/drm/drm_ioctl.h |    7 ++++++
 drivers/char/drm/gamma_dma.c |   45 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++------
 2 files changed, 46 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)

   gamma_dma_priority and gamma_dma_send_buffers both deref d->send_indices
   and/or d->send_sizes.  When these functions are called from gamma_dma,
   these pointers are user pointers and are thus not safe to deref.  This patch
   copies over the pointers inside gamma_dma_priority and
   gamma_dma_send_buffers.

   The dev->devname being passed to request_irq in drm_irq.h is null.
   With the old DRM interface, the devname was set in DRM(setunique),
   but with the current DRM interface >=1.1 the devname is not being
   set in DRM(set_busid).
