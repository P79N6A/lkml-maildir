[wondering if anyone has tried this before]
i've got a computer that has (already built-in) an impressive bootstrap-loader.
it can load an image from disk, network (rcp, ftp, tftp) or from flash.
here's the caveat: it is a vxworks boot loader.
it can load a Linux kernel (provided it is a raw ELF file, such as that 
normally kept in arch/i386/boot/compress/bvmlinux), and execute at the 
appropriate place (0x100000).
unfortunately, the processor is already in protected-mode by the time the 
linux kernel starts running.  this is where things 'stop'.
anyone have any clues as to how one would get it working?
it'd be a shame to have to remove the bootstrap loader that already exists 
-- re-creating the same functionality would be painful.
cheers,
lincoln.
