I find this feature very interesting from a testing perspective. Now, 
since I don't like the idea of being the only one that uses a feature 
(not maintained - may be even to be removed?) may be you could advice me 
on a more broadly used way to get the value of a non exported kernel 
variable from inside a test running in user mode? should I use /dev/mem 
instead? But in that case, I should do the virtual to physical 
conversion myself, right?

Nadia
