The allocator I have posted can be easily fixed for that.  In fact, I had a
version which used per_cpu_offset.  My earlier experiments proved that
pointer arithmetic is  marginally faster than the per_cpu_offset
based version.  Also, why waste a register if we can achieve same dereference
speeds without using a register?  But as I said, we can modify the allocator I
posted to use per_cpu_offset.

As regards tiny allocations, many existing users of alloc_percpu are
structures which are aggregations of many counters -- like the mib statistics,
disk_stats etc.  So IMHO, dynamic percpu allocator should work well for
both small and large objects.  I have done some user space measurements
with my version and the allocator behaves well with both small and random sized
objects.
The advantages of my implementation as I see it is:
1. Independent of slab/kmalloc
2. Doesn't need arches to do their own node local allocation -- generic
   version does that.
3. Space efficient -- about 98% utilization achieved in userspace tests
4. Allocates pages for cpu_possible cpus only
disadvantage:
1. Uses vmalloc area and hence additional tlb foot print -- but is there a
   better  way to keep node local allocations, simple pointer arithmetic
   and page allocations for cpu_possible cpus only
Thanks,
Kiran
