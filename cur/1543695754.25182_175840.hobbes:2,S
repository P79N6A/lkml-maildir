We really should not retain ugly interfaces in the mainline kernel because
some external, unmerged piece of code relies on the old interfaces.  That
way lies madness.
Especially as that external code has, I think, remained unmerged for years,
and there appears to be no momentum moving it forwards.
We *have* to get the mainline codebase up-to-date with current kernel
idioms and working as well as possible.  If you want to submit sane-sized
and documented patches to help us get there then sheesh, go wild.  But
please do not try to stop the rest of us.

Please describe this breakage.
Ben, I confess that I'd forgotten about #1198.  I'll take a look at your
memory allocation fix - it seems to be unfortunately large, but we may need
to go that way.
One question is: why do we go down a different code path for blockdevs
nowadays anyway?  The handoff to the loop thread seems to work OK for
file-backed loop, and providing a bmap() for blockdevs is easy enough?
