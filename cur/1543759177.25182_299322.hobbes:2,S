It still does not solve the problem of "untested" releases. Users will
still ignore the linus-tree-rcX kernels. 
So we move the real -rcX phase after the so called stable release. 
Doing -rcX from the "sucker" tree up to a stable release makes much more
sense and would have more testers and get back lost confidence.
