Here's the output (counter is something I added inside the while (1)
{}-loop, on top in that loop, it's unsigned int, set to 0 to start with):
tg3.c:v0.90 (Feb 25, 2002)
DEBUG: counter 6592
DEBUG: smallest_limit is 10000
DEBUG: read_partno returned -19
tg3: Problem fetching invariants of chip, aborting.
smallest_limit is naturally 10k since limit isn't decremented...
