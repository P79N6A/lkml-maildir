Remember - we report the _return_ address of a function when we use
__builtin_return_address(0) in that function.
This means that if kfree() is called from a tail-call optimised
position, the reported address will be the parent function of the
one which actually called it.
Therefore, cfi_intelext_erase_varsize() called some other function
(in this case, via a function pointer) which then called kfree() in
a tail-call optimised position.  jffs2_erase_callback() would be
called from this function pointer and does have kfree() in a tail-call
optimised position.
However, reading the code around jffs2_erase_callback() and
jffs2_erase_block(), I can find nothing obviously wrong.
The main problem is that I don't actually know what triggered it in the
first place - I'd just booted the machine and was just logging in when
it poped up, but repeating this does not cause the problem.
