I'm not talking about auto propagation (that's only now being
implemented by Ram Pai, and is not in stock kernels).
What I'm saying is that mounting something over a leaf node, does not
guarantee, that it will remain a leaf node after it's been mounted on.
For example:
mkdir /tmp/leafdir
mkdir /tmp/rootcopy
mount --bind / /tmp/rootcopy
mount /dev/sdb1 /tmp/leafdir
mkdir /tmp/rootcopy/tmp/leafdir/child
Now 'leafdir' is no longer a leaf.
I'm not saying this is a problem, but also I don't see any
overwhelming reason to not allow user mounts over non-leaf
directories.
