Yeah, it has been done from user space using a libusb based
application.  (that didn't work with a usb-hub in the loop) and had
code that was just too nasty for words, so I made a kernel driver that
looks nicer to me and enables a nice python FW loader program to work.
What is the linux-usb policies on new drivers that could be
implemented in user space?  When does a kernel driver make  sense over
a libusb one?
