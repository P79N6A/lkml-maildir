Subject: courier-imap/maildrop now doing proper fsync'ing

The newest versions of courier-imap, a maildir POP3/POP3S/IMAP/IMAPS
server, and maildrop, a MDA, now have a compile time configure option:
--with-dirsync
Should it now be safe to run ext3 filesystems (that contain the
maildirs) with data=writeback?
BTW, procmail isn't doing proper fsyncing when writing to a maildir.
