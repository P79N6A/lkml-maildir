I might have actually just killed the process I was grepping for (I was 
grepping to see if it had actually gone away yet).  Dunno if that helps...
I haven't been able to reproduce it either.  I think the pipe to grep (or 
something similar) is important because your test isn't doing what mine did: 
one process was looking at another process at the instant of process creation 
(or perhaps exit).  Maybe the appropriate null terminator is written out 
after the process goes live?
This is a UP system, but I have preemption on...
