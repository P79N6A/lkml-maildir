I've had the same problem with some 2.4.21-preX twice (or maybe more times,
don't remember) on one of my machines.
IMHO it has something to do with NFS. (I'm using this box as a NFS-client).
I wish, I could reproduce it one more time, to do some traces, etc
on it. But I've not found a way to reproduce it, yet.
