there's a patch in the works to change futex hashing to not require page
pinning, without making futexes process-local. This should also fix the
FUTEX_FD problems.
basically the idea is that struct page remains to be a good hash whenever
the page is present, and the swapout pte value is a good hash key when the
page is swapped out. So we basically can make futexes swappable.
this gets rid of pinned pages and pagetable locking, without the need for
API-level changes.

ok, i'll fix this! I knew i missed something ...
