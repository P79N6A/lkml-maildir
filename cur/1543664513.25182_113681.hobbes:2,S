Smashing!  However, it should probably avoid correcting spellings
in anything but C comments.
Perhaps my C comment parser should be converted to perl and
incorporated into spell-fix.pl, and used to divide the source
file into two streams (comment and noncomment); the comment
stream would be spell-fixed and merged back with the noncomment
stream to create the output.
And thanks to Shaheed for converting my list of misspellings to a correction list!
I suggest we remove the entries
  broken=borken
  brain-damaged=dain-bramaged,dain bramaged
as we're not trying to remove humor from the comments.
Also, the words 'controllen' and 'callin',  are not typos, so
  calling=callin
should be removed, and
  controller=controler,controllen
should be just
  controller=controler
The above examples make me think the list of corrections will have
to be very carefully vetted before we turn this thing loose.
