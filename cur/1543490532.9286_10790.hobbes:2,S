The distribution will set the for me. And when I install the Pike
interperter, then it's package will add the approiate link.

My girlfriend wouldn't know that was the problem, I'd have to tell her.
She shouldn't have to know. There should be a way for it to find it by
itself..
Perhaps this would be better:
#!/usr/bin/perl
#!perl
Then it would work on the old systems and the autofind systems.
All systems should support this kind of system.

Though using tr on the whole file is not the solution either (as someone
else sugessted) as there might be \r's embeded elseware in the program for
some reason.
