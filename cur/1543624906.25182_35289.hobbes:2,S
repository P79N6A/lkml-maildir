This is normal, you just need to accept the remote changes for all those 
new/renamed files.  BitKeeper doesn't support doing this automatically 
for all files, so I had to highlight the expected BitKeeper response in 
another window, and then click <paste> on my mouse around 300 times... 
(~300 new files)
