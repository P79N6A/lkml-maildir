   The ip_dst_cache seems unreasonably large.  Unless your desktop is a
   backbone router or something.
Lots of DST entries can result on any machine actually.  We create one
per source address, not just per destination address.  So if you talk
to a lot of sites, or lots of sites talk to you, you'll get a lot of
DST entries.
Regardless, 80MB _IS_ excessive.  That's nearly 400,000 entries.
It definitely indicates there is a leak somewhere.
Although it say:
ip_dst_cache       19470  19470   4096    1    1
Which is 19470 active objects right?
There is a known aparent issue with IPV6, there is some DST
leak there, but that is irrelevant here since we're clearly
talking about the ipv4 dst cache.
