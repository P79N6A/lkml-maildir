The SysRq code has been updated to make it useable with keyboards that
are broken in other ways than your. With the new behaviour, you should
be able to use Magic SysRq with your keyboard in this way:
	Press and hold an Alt key,
	Press and release the SysRq key,
	Press and release some hot key like S or T or 7,
	Repeat the previous step as many times as desired,
	Release the Alt key.
Does that work for you?
