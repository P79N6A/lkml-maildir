-mm4 also had readahead changes which will adversely impact database-style
workloads.  I'd suggest that you revert
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.1/2.6.1-mm4/broken-out/readahead-revert-lazy-readahead.patch
and retest.
We reverted lazy readahead because it broke NFS linear reads and was doing
the wrong thing anyway.  We need to come up with something else for
database-style workloads.
