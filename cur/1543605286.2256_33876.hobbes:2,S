2.4.5pre1 is the base for comparison, but because privacy issues and company
policies, I can't give out anything but comparative numbers.  These should
be enough to see what has been happening over the last couple of months of
kernel development. 
The tests performed on the same equipment and networks using SPEC SFS NFS
benchmark testing.  We have attempted to limit as many variables as we can.
Hardware:
- 4 Pentium III Xeon processors, 4GB ram
- 45 fibre channel drives, set up in hardware RAID 0/1
- 2 direct Gigabit Ethernet connections between SPEC SFS prime client and
system under test
- reiserfs
- all NFS filesystems exported with sync,no_wdelay to insure O_SYNC writes
to storage
- NFS v3 UDP
- LVM
