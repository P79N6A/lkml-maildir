Hi
I have a little problem with ide-scsi in 2.2.14 and 2.2.15pre3 (infact it
started in the 2.2.14pre series, but I hoped it would get fixed in 2.2.14).
But It isn't, so here comes a bugreport on it.
When I try to burn a cd in my cd recorder I get errors :
CDB:  AA 00 00 00 27 90 00 00 00 10 00 00
Sense Bytes: 70 00 06 00 00 00 00 12 00 00 00 00 C5 00 00 00
Sense Key: 0x6 Unit Attention, Segment 0
Sense Code: 0xC5 Qual 0x00 (vendor unique sense code 0xC5) Fru 0x0
Sense flags: Blk 0 (not valid) 
Sense Bytes: 70 00 02 00 00 00 00 12 00 00 00 00 04 01 00 00 00 00
one more:

I'm not really shure if any of these messages are from cdrecord. (none of
them end up in my syslog).
This usually happens after the recorder has burned 10-100MB, diffrent
amount each time.
It works as a charm in 2.2.13. If you want I can try some 2.2.14pre
kernels to see where it broke.
My recorder is a Sony CDU928E with firmware 1.1n (think it's the latest
firmware).
If you have any patches or anything that you want me to test, send them
and I'll try them out. (good thng there's a dummy mode :)
