Hi guys,
Just a quick note saying that the last thing I see is "Freeing unused
memory: 240k" and then it appears to loop entering and leaving
flush_old_exec() and the only task (apart from the usual kernel
threads) is the init, which is running, R).
I will _slowly_ investigate this (instruction at a time) of if anyone has
fast ideas - let me know.
Regards,
Tigran
