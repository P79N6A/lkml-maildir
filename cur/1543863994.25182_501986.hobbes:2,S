I will have to find where in the code that is happening.

I am not sure actually.  I just open /dev/ttyn0 and /dev/ttyn1 and write
to one, and read from the other.  I didn't even know about the line
diciplines actually.  How do I tell which one I am using?
I have confirmed that all the data is being passed to
tty_insert_flip_string() in jsm_input().
