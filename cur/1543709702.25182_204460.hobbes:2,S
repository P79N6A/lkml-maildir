> Changing kernel config should never change the API.
Linux would be in pretty sad shape if that held.
Incompatible API changes should be rare, but they are an essential part
of our continuing healthy evolution.  In particular, there's a _long_
list of hardware devices that have at some time or other worked on
Linux, but don't anymore - usually because no one is still maintaining
the driver needed.  But sometimes other API's have to change or
disappear as well.
Would you say that a city or county should _never_ raze a building or
remove a road as part of development?
Change happens.  Deal with it.
