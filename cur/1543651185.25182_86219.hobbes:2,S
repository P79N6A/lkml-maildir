Bloat is not just RAM/CPU/... usage when in use, it is much more about
developers who have to understand, work with, and consider how to use or
interface with the new code. Even more so when it is not builtin, as this
creates _two_ scenarios to consider.
This is the sense of "bloat" that Linus is most worried about (and very
rightly so, IMVHO). At lesat that is my observation over the years.
