Agreed. I have a similar problem on ppc where it's common to have things
like the main PIC on a PCI device. Note that another problem is (or at
least was, i haven't checked recently) the P2P bridge scanning code
that, in a similar way, can block the path to all devices below it. I
-do- have a case for example with Apple Xserve G4's where the main Apple
IO ASIC, which is a PCI device containing the PIC, the power management
controller, and various low level system control IOs is behind a pair of
P2P bridges.
One solution for us (PPC) is to enforce those devices and bridges to be
described in the OF tree, and generalize a bit the code we have for some
64 bits machines, that synthetizes the pci_dev's from the OF nodes
rather than probing. But that's not going to help other archs.
In fact, that's a problem we also have with
pci_assign_unassigned_resources() which will happily move things around
that must not be moved, especially when sitting behind P2P bridges.
So the root of the issue is much deeper than just a quirk here I
believe.
Cheers,
Ben.
