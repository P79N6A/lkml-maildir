The mysql+oltp peak loss is there either way, but with 2, mid range
throughput is ~28 baseline.  High end (yawn) is better, and the nfs
kbuild performs better than baseline.
Baseline performance, at least wrt mysql+oltp doesn't seem to be an
option.  Not my call.  More testing and more testers required I suppose.
