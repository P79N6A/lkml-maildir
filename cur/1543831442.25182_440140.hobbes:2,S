I tend to agree. I'm thinking for now I should leave it as is, so it
defaults to configuring 3 EPs. Perhaps later I'll try to collect #EP
info for all the supported devices.

This is curious. I saw that '0218' in Greg's code, and 'corrected' it to
0018, because here's what I get with my MC5720:
P:  Vendor=1199 ProdID=0018 Rev= 0.01
S:  Manufacturer=Sierra Wireless
S:  Product=Sierra Wireless MC5720 Modem
So evidently there are also multiple variants of each modem.
