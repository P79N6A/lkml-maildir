My preemptible kernel patch currently just uses Linux semaphores to
implement sleeping kernel mutexes, but we (at MontaVista Software) are
working on a new implementation that also does priority inheritance,
to avoid the priority inversion problem, and that does the minimum
necessary context switches.
