Hi,
I bought a new Typhoon keyboard (Navigator Office XP, clone of Microsoft's 
one, using classic ps2 port), and I was traying to make the new keys working.
With xev, or xmms-itouch grab function, I was able to see the keycodes of some 
keys.. but most of these I wasn't able to get anything usable (or it doesn't 
show anything, or it shows '37' that is an alphabetic character I suppose, 
using xev I see two keypresses instead of one).
It was happening also with my old keyboard.
Can someone help me get something useful from this keyboard?
Thanks in advance.
