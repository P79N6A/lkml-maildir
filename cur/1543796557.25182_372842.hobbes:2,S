"Regression" as the threat of updating. That was the starting point :)
I believe the reason to abandon the previous "stable" branchlet was the
assumption that the new kernel had all fixes from the previous "stable"
merged, i. e. every patch between 2.6.14 and 2.6.14.3 would become part
of 2.6.15 (or the underlying problem addressed by a patch were resolved
some other way).

Perhaps a fixed number of releases doesn't cut it. Perhaps a fixed time
neither. If the changes betweeen two subsequent releases is low, one or
more extra versions come for free, but if lots of changes go in all over
the map, it's going to be a royal pain.
It ultimately boils down to the question: how far^Wfast the upstream
wants to run away^W^Wprogress from its previous release.

I think there is no such thing as The Single One New Driver[tm]. Some
are quite intrusive, some aren't. Sometimes the new driver works with
older kernels (if the driver is self-contained, for instance just a
dozen new lines of code in an existing driver), sometimes not (because
midlayer or core changes are required to support the new driver).
