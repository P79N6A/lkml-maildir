When you unpack the tar as an unprivileged user you get ownership of the
files and can compile. root on the other hand should have a restrictive
umask setting so you would need to chmod anyways. However I find myself
typing "chown -R 0.0 .; chmod -R u=rwX,go=rX ." quite often so I would
appreciate some kind of a (set|fix)perms target.
