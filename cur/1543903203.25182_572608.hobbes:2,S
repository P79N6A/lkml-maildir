assuming this is the suspend-from-ram after a kexec back from the 
write-to-disk kernel I don't think you are correct.
when doing a suspend-to-ram you get to a point where you just don't use 
any userspace. from that point on you are just walking the device tree 
putting things into low-power mode. This is the point where we are talking 
about jumping to.
