That's the point. On kernel 2.6.11 on same box I have no delay. It is
instantaneous. On 2.6.12-rc1 it was instantaneous but I didn't use it
much because I had drm problems. Later I tried 2.6.12 final and it was
hanging. I saw the "seeing a minute plugs hangs" on 2.6.13-rc1 release
notes and thought this could be the problem, but I compiled it and tried
with no luck :(
Now, I'm thinking it could be something like the udev hang which
disapeared with udev update to 058.
I don't know what can be happening. I think it is because of some type
of timeout.
If you think there is something else I can do, please let me know.
Thanks in advance for your help, Andrew.
