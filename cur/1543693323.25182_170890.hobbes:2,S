Are you sure?  If you issue a write to block 1 and then issue another
write to block 1, it would have to guarantee the relative order of those 
writes (or equivalent optimization in the write cache), wouldn't it?

But we're not talking about errors IN the disk drive after the communi-
cation between the kernel and drive is already done.  We're talking
about errors in the communication BETWEEN the kernel and the drive (lost
DMA interrupts), aren't we?
If the kernel issues a write command to the drive, and never gets a 
response (DMA-complete interrupt?) from the drive that it has accepted 
the command, why can't the kernel repeat the write command?
