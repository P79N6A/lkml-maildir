Because there are two clock sources in the machine and it's using the other 
one, so the interrupt isn't firing?
Are you saying that the /proc statistics aren't accurate, or that you 
previously misunderstood what it was actually measuring and you'd now like it 
to lie?

I didn't think Thomas even touched the /proc/interrupts reporting code.  It's 
still accurate.  The patch changed the usage of timers, /proc/interrupts is 
accurately showing the change, and you're surprised that what it was 
measuring wasn't what you thought it was measuring all along.
This ain't jiffies.  This is how often the PIT fired.  They are not the same 
thing.
