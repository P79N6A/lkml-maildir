I've seen excellent programmers fscking up use of && and ||.
I've also seen quite a few guys coming (from their experience) to
the conclusions that look an awful lot similar to mine.  Like, say it,
dmr and ken.  Or Linus.  Or Rob Pike.  Or Brian Kernighan.
And frankly, when I hear about "typed" interfaces, two things come to
mind - "typed files" and CORBA.  Both - architectural failures.
