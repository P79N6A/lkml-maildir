| I just found another set of messages in the logs as well:

| CPU 1: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
| Bank 1: b200000000000115
| Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt

Appendix E of
"IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer's Manual
Volume 3 : System Programming Guide" is
"INTERPRETING MACHINE-CHECK ERROR CODES".
You can download it from developer.intel.com website.
Dave Jones has also begun a program called "parsemce".
You can get it at
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/cruft/parsemce.c
 and
compile/run it.
