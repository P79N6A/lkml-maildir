Err, turns up I maybe was right with the bisection.  I think that the
drm patches mess my box in some way that it makes ALSA fail: I was
trying to load the modules by hand as you suggested, but the machine
rebooted instantaneously.
As I was about to retry, it occured to me that maybe this drm had
something to do after all and I tried shutting down the X server _before_
loading the ALSA modules: box freeze.
Now, the box is behaving OK (no oopses) with the DRI line commented in
the xorg.conf file. I'll try to narrow down which part of the DRM update
is causing such a strange behaviour. Sorry for the noise Takashi.
Regards,
Frederik
