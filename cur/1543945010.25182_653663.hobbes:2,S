I think I'd suggest something like:
new_mnt->mnt_flags = (old_mnt->mnt_flags & ~arg_mask) | (arg_flags & mask)

Sounds reasonable to me. But it wouldn't directly solve the "do a
recursive bind mount setting the MS_READONLY flag on all children"
problem, so we'd need some of the earlier suggestions too.
