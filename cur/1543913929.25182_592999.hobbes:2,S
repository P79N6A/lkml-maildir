fallback-dir is better.
vdir came from make's vpath but then very few knows about vpath anyway so that 
was not the best source of inspiration.

My first attempt was along these lines but I dropped it for two reasons:
1) Mixing obj-y and other-obj-y assinment broke all assumptions on linkorder.
   It would not be possible to link objexts in order a1.o, a2.o, a3.o if a1.o
   and a3.o were assigned to obj-y and a2.o was assigned to other-obj-y. 
2) It needed a decent amouth of unreadable gmake-foo to introduce
   a second variable. And the learning curve for kbuild internals are alreay
   to steep so I try to avoid additional complexity.
I'm a bit reluctant to just enable the fallback-dir functionality.
There is no point in adding this for the sake of x86 if we merge
i386 and x86_64 a few days after.
