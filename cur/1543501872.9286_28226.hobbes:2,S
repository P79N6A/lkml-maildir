	Yes, LDAP is a directory ACCESS PROTOCOL -- one way
	for accessing information.  That information semantics
	may be similar to "/etc/passwd", and its uses, but
	it absolutely is not limited to it.
	Most people unfamiliar with the system believe LDAP to
	be some magic DATABASE.   It isn't.
	See  RFC 2307: Using LDAP as a Network Information Service
	which shows one way to use LDAP to achieve NIS-like
	setup.

	Those are *user space* modules, NOT KERNEL.

	Oh, you are intel user, aren't you ?
	That small numeric space of UIDs is another (and
	certainly kernel) issue, mainly though because of
	lots of syscalls and pre-existing software BINARIES
	with 16-bit UIDs/GIDs.
	In userspace glibc 2.1 (at least) has 32-bit uid_t,
	but kernel syscalls are still 16-bit ones.
	Getting out of that requires rather massive change,
	which indeed might not be quite what you want.
	(Recompile kernel with enlarged __kernel_uid_t,
	 recompile glibc 2.1 with matching __kernel_uid_t,
	 THROW AWAY/RECOMPILE ALL BINARIES THAT ARE STATICALLY
	 LINKED AND/OR OTHERWISE DON'T USE glibc 2.1.)
	Implementing a new set of syscalls with enlarged
	passed values in value fields/whatnot is better way,
	and it will "only" need support in the glibc 2.1.
	Old binaries will still run, although strange alias
	effects might appear when (uid % 65536) == 0, etc..
