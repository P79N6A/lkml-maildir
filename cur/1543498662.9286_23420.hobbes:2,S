Hi, 
this is a really stupid question, but I couldn't find an
answer anywhere... If I have modules enabled in my kernel,
and have already done make zImage and make modules, but then
I decide that I want just one more module, how can I build it?
I have the feeling that I can edit .config manually, and then
run make dep, but what do i do after that?
If I try make -C some_directory modules, that doesn't work.
Is there some trivial way to do this, or do I just have to modify
the makefile for my module and build it totally independently?
Thanks for any help,
sds
