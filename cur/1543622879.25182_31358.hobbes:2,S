The problem here is that currently the mainline kernel makes some bad
dicesions in the VM, and -aa is the solution in this case.  When -aa is
merged, you will still have both solutions; one in mainline, one as a patch
(rmap).
Linus has already changed the VM once in 2.4, and I don't really see another
large VM change (rmap in 2.4) happening again.
Rmap looks promising for a 2.5 merge after several issues are overcome
(pte-highmem, etc).
