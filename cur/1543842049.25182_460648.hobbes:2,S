As other people commented we normally don't merge hook only patches.
The reason for this is that with Linux being so popular
and so many people want hooks for their various addons that if there
wasn't a fairly strict policy about it then at some point the core kernel
code might contain more hooks than actual code doing something.
But I see no reason why mainline shouldn't support Stratus
systems, so if you merge the whole thing in a clean way it 
might be possible. It must be already GPL since the exports are _GPL.
Bonus points if the dirty tracking is done in a generic enough way that it 
might be useful for other kernel things too (is that possible? I know Xen etc
use it at the Hypervisor level for various stuff)
