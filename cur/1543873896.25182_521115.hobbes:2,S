I know that it is invisible. Nevertheless I know that the BIOSes emulate
PS/2 keyboards from USB via SMM during the boot process until we call
the usb_handoff function.

I have more than one box (even original Intel mainboards), where either
plugging a PS/2 keyboard or switching off USB makes this problem go
away.

calibrating APIC timer ...
... lapic delta = 2426884
... PM timer delta = 833908
APIC calibration PIT not consistent with PM Timer: 232ms instead of 100ms
APIC delta adjusted to PM-Timer: 1041737 (2426884)
..... delta 1041737
..... mult: 44749065
..... calibration result: 166677
..... CPU clock speed is 4659.0624 MHz.
..... host bus clock speed is 166.0677 MHz.
This box is off by factor 2.3 and using the PM-Timer instead of the
PIT/jiffies values gives me a correct result.
Another one:
APIC calibration not consistent with PM Timer: 2020ms instead of 100ms
APIC delta adjusted to PM-Timer: 1254436 (25341111)
Off by factor 20 !!
The original APIC timer calibration did:
	local_irq_disable();
	wait_until_pit_underflows();
	t1 = read_apic_counter();
	for (i = 0; i < HZ/10; i++)
		wait_until_pit_underflows();
	t2 = read_apic_counter();
and calculated the APIC timer frequency from the delta of t1 and t2 vs.
the 100ms time.
This had 2 problems:
1. It gave results, which are off by factor 2-10 on a couple of boxen.
2. Some systems stop there dead as the PIT readout is broken.
I changed it to do:
	local_irq_disable();
	original_pit_handler = pit->handler;
	pit->handler = lapic_calibration_handler;
	loops = 0;
	local_irq_enable();
	wait_until_handler_has_done_HZ/10_loops();
The handler does:
	if (!loops++) {
		t1_apic = read_apic_counter();
		t1_jiffies = jiffies;
		t1_pm = read_pm_timer();
	}
	if (loops == HZ/10) {
		t2_apic = read_apic_counter();
		t2_jiffies = jiffies;
		t2_pm = read_pm_timer();
		done = 1;
	}
If the pmtimer is available, then calculate the APIC timer frequency
from the t1_pm/t2_pm delta, otherwise use jiffies.
When pm_timer is there, we can trust the calculated value, if not we do
a verify run of the periodic apic timer and the pit timer. If this fails
- and it fails often due to the SMM crap - then I use the PIT and IPIs.
In the first version I did a verification run even when pm_timer was
there, but this produced false positives as well, because the lapic
timer interrupt is in the same way delayed as the PIT interrupt. I
removed this to avoid unnecessary switching to IPIs after I verified,
that it always produced false positives when the calibration was done
against the PM-Timer.
