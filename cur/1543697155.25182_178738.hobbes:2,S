Hello,
I'm not subscribed to the list - please CC me replies.
I experienced hardl lockups and instant reboots with a possibly corrupted 
reiserfs. I didn't find anything like this with goolge so I post it here.
The lockup occures reproduceable when a specific user accesses a file in a 3.6 
reiserfs partition. Even Magic-Sysreq seems to not work. 
The instant reboot happens when I try to copy this users HOME to a different 
location on a different filessystem. 
I'm rather sure that the fs is damaged because I tried reiserfsck  and will 
have to repair with --rebuild-tree.
Please let me know if this error is already known and where to find 
information about it.
If not I will keep the corrupted fs for testing and bugtracking.
Greets
