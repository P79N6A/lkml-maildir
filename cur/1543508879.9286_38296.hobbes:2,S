Linus?
Have you left the office yet?  ;-)
PCI probing in drivers really sucks.  The attached patch against 2.3.18
is small, self-contained, and should be incredibly valuable to PCI
driver writers.  I myself have duplicated this code in no less than
_four_ drivers.
My patch adds a PCI probing function which takes an array of PCI ids
(typically __initdata tables in a driver), and probes for each in turn. 
It calls a callback function to do the actual registration work.  The
architecture is very flexible, and should be useful to most people
supporting drivers with more than one chipset, or more than one board.
Can we sneak this small, totally-zero-impact, easy-to-review, tested
patch in?  ;-)
Regards,
	Jeff
