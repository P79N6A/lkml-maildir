Hi Chip,
That's true. I agree that once kdump kernel starts we very well can be
in a situation where ISR/IRR bits of LAPIC are set and IRR bit of IOAPIC
is set. These are pending interrupt which will be delivered in the
second kernel and that kernel will reject these pending interrupts as spurious
interrupt and send an EOI. This will clear the LAPIC state. 
But the issue here seems to be that LAPIC state got clear but IRR bit
at IOAPIC bit is not cleared because IOAPIC vector information was deleted
in first kernel and now upon receiving EOI, it does not know this EOI belongs
to which vector.
Given the fact that "irqpoll" makes things work, I think we should not 
complicate the logic and leave it like that. Anyway, our goal is to capture
the dump and not make sure in second kernel interrupt from all the devices
are coming.
Otherwise we shall have to resort to techniques like first masking all
the interrupts at IOAPIC level, then issuing EOI on all the cpus in the
first kernel itself. It makes the logic little twisted. 
Thanks
Vivek
