Hi,
I'm trying to implement a UDP server in a kernel module. So far I have 
created the struct socket using sock_create_kern(), and used 
sock->ops->bind() on it. Now how do I send UDP datagrams? I looked at 
some code and found the function sock->ops->sendmsg() but I can't figure 
out where to put the destination address. I would appreciate it if 
someone could point me to some tutorial or sample code.
Thanks,
Josef
