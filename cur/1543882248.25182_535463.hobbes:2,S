They get frustrated because they focussed on developing new features 
instead of fixing regressions, and now it takes longer until their new 
features get merged because noone fixed the regressions...

"wait for reports to trickle in from testers" is exactly the opposite of 
our problem.
I started the regression lists originally to prove the fairy tale
"noone tests -rc kernels" some kernel developers spread as wrong.
Look at the facts:
8 out of 14 regressions in my current list were reported in March or earlier.
And for many regressions fixed it took several weeks until debugging 
by a kernel developer was started.
We do not lack testers for getting bug reports quickly.
We lack developer manpower for debugging the many regression reports.

There's not a realistic chance for 0 regressions, and 4 months was 
a worst case, not the average case.
But I am not happy with the current state of released kernels.

And all the people who have to upgrade to 2.6.21 for getting an 
important security fix run into a dozen known (and many unknown) 
regressions.
I don't think that's fine.

If we had the developer manpower to get each reported regression 
debugged and fixed [1] within three weeks, 2.6.21 might be in the shape 
I would have liked it to be today.
But there are the three interdependent variables time, developer 
manpower and quality. And few developer manpower and few time results in 
a lower quality of the release I'm not happy with.
Life has taught me that sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong, and 
sometimes both sides have a possible solution. We might agree to 
disagree, and you are the one who's opinion counts. I can only say that 
I am not happy with the result, and that I do therefore not spend my 
time on maintaining regression lists for 2.6.22 - and maintaining such 
lists is not something special noone else could do equally well.
