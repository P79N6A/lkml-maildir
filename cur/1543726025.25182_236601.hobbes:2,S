Looks like all of them use DEBUG_KERNEL.
DEBUG_SLAB is not available in cris, h8300, m68knommu, sh, sh64,
or v850 AFAICT.  Yes/no ?

Yes, sounds good, I'll change that.

Yes, will change that one also.

It could.  It depends on one's config (or code/patch) philosophy.
I was trying to be explicit about which arches support a config option
by including each arch in a list ("inclusion").  Or I could exclude
certain arches from config options ("exclusion").  The inclusion
method seems safer and more readable/maintainable to me, but that's
just one opinion.
