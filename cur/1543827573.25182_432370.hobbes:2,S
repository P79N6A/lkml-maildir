ACK. And it will take years to somwhat get a grip on the the spam
problem. And will take more "tools" than SPF.

Well, the only necessary admin intervention was "update that MTA
package". This seems trivial and no work for people used to
yum/apt-get/urpmi/red-carpet/... but it looked quite differently 10
years ago for other OSs (Win*, Solaris 2.5, etc., hell, I knew of a
third-party MTA on Novell 3.12 where it was not even possible to
deactivate relaying).

It was an interesting experience in Austria for (mostly small) ISPs that
from one day to another email delivery didn't work anymore. No wonder
since they had almost no reverse DNS zones ....

Use secure authenticated mail submission on a known good MTA of said

Yes, this seems like a waste of everything - but IMHO neglectable
compared to the ressources wasted by spam.

Apparently spammers are faster to adopt new developments and standards
than others. SCNR ...

Well, if you run a mail server behind a quite small line and some
spammer really forges your domain in the From: so that it takes 4 days
(yes, 96 hours) so that the bounce storm calms down and legitimate mail
can be processed again, means against trivial domain forgeries make
sense.
