watch the resonate heartbeat and see if it is getting lost in the network
traffic (the resonate logs will show missing heartbeat packets). think
seriously of setting the resonate stuff to run at a higher priority so
that it doesn't get behind.
depending on how high your network traffic is seriously look at putting in
a second nic and switch to move the NFS traffic off the network that has
the internet traffic and hearbeat.
I had the same problem with central dispatch a couple years ago when first
implementing it. the exact details of the problem that I ran into should
have been fixed by now (mostly having to do with large number of virtual
IP addresses) but the symptoms were the same.
