you have removed priority recalculation, but priority recalculation has a
goal: not running processes gather priority approaching maximum priority
(40) logarithmically. This is how we 'boost' interactive processes
automatically. Maybe i've misread your patch, but where is this mechanizm
now? (or if it's replaced by something else, how does that work?)
