I heard Linus say that he wanted Configure.help split up.  I agreed to
do it, too, in CML2.  But I thought I was not supposed to mess with existing 
formats -- in fact, I was afraid to, because you and Al Viro beat me up
so hard about changing *nothing* before cutover.  The CML1 code owns that
format, and I am not the CML1 maintainer.  In fact mec specifically turned
me down when I volunteered for that job; he said he wanted me concentrating
on CML2.
Neither Linus nor anyone else ever said to me "Eric, it's your job to 
make that change."  When I asked for guidance, Linus blackholed my mail.
Was I supposed to be practicing telepathy, here?
