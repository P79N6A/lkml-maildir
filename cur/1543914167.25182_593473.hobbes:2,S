I can't agree with this.
It took me lots of time to configure mutt to work well for me in the first
time. Just default settings are far _not_ enough, especially for us
non-english-speakers. One common setting is the encoding, of course, lkml
prefers UTF-8, so I must set my mutt with `set send_charset="us-ascii:utf-8"`.
Manuals of mutt told me to add "subscribe linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org" if I
subscribed lkml, but in fact, we'd better _not_ add this, or it will drop
myself from cc list.
Or other things like these.

Yes, you can `set editor="vi"` or other editors you prefer.
