That might be OK.
But our current status quo is not OK:
Check Rafael's regressions lists asking yourself
"How many regressions are older than two weeks?" 
The kernel Bugzilla curerntly knows about 212 open regression bugs.
(And many more have not made it into Bugzilla.)
We have unmaintained and de facto unmaintained parts of the kernel where 
even issues that might be easy to fix don't get fixed.

No disagreement on this, its just a different issue than our bug fixing 
problem.
