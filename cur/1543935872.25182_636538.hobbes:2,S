The following is a series of patchsets related to Unionfs.  This is the
fourth set of patchsets resulting from an lkml review of the entire unionfs
code base, in preparation for a merge into mainline.  The most significant
changes here are a few locking/race bugfix related to branch-management.
These patches were tested (where appropriate) on Linus's 2.6.24 latest code
(as of v2.6.24-rc7-71-gfd0b45d), MM, as well as the backports to
2.6.{23,22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs, nfs2/3/4, jffs2,
ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  Also tested with
LTP-full and with a continuous parallel kernel compile (while forcing cache
flushing, manipulating lower branches, etc.).  See
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
 to download back-ported unionfs code.
