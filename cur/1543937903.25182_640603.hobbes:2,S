It is not perfect, but I do have a git repo of the rt history-of-patches
up at:
 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cloos/rt-2.6.git
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cloos/rt-2.6.git
Gitweb URL is:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/cloos/rt-2.6.git
It is in the one-head per patch style, and has the single-file patches
applied rather than the quilt queue.
But it will at least allow comparisons among the various versions.
The master head matches the most current patch.
(I try to keep it updated the same day as patches are announced, but
it does sometimes lag a day or two.)
