You got your wish.  Andrea's mm patch introduced into the main tree at
2.4.10-pre11 uses a standard LRU:
+               if (PageTestandClearReferenced(page)) {
+                       if (PageInactive(page)) {
+                               del_page_from_inactive_list(page);
+                               add_page_to_active_list(page);
+                       } else if (PageActive(page)) {
+                               list_del(entry);
+                               list_add(entry, &active_list);

There are arguments about whether page aging can be superior to standard LRU,
and I personally believe it can be, but there's no question that ordinary LRU
is a lot easier to implement correctly and will perform a lot better than
incorrectly implemented/untuned page aging.
The arguments in support of aging over LRU that I'm aware of are:
  - incrementing an age is more efficient than resetting several LRU list links
  - also captures some frequency-of-use information
  - it can be implemented in hardware (not that that matters much)
  - allows more scope for tuning/balancing (and also rope to hang oneself)
The big problem with aging is that unless it's entirely correctly balanced its
just not going to work very well.  To balance it well requires knowing a lot
about rates of list scanning and so on.  Matt Dillon perfected this art in BSD,
but we never did, being preoccupied with things like just getting the mm
scanners to activate when required, and sorting out our special complexities
like zones and highmem buffers.  Probably another few months of working on it
would let us get past the remaining structural problems and actually start
tuning it, but we've already made people wait way too long for a stable 2.4.
A more robust strategy makes a lot of sense right now.  We can still play with
stronger magic in 2.5, and of course Rik's aging strategy will continue to be
developed in Alan's tree while Andrea's is still going through the test of
fire.

I'll keep reading Andrea's code and maybe I'll be able to shed some more light
on the algorithms he's using, since he doesn't seem to be in a big hurry to
do that himself.  (Hi Andrea ;-)
