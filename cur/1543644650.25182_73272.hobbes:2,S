	The main reason I write multithreaded apps for single CPU systems is to 
protect against ambush. Consider, for example, a web server. Someone sends it 
an obscure request that triggers some code that's never run before and has to 
fault in. If my application were single-threaded, no work could be done until 
that page faulted in from disk. This is why select-loop and poll-loop type 
servers are bursty.
