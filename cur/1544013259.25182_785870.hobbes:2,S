Subject: worth submitting a detailed EDID structure?

  just noticed the header file include/video/edid.h, which defines
video EDID info as simply:
  struct edid_info {
        unsigned char dummy[128];
  };
a couple months back, i had to mess with EDID info and defined a
detailed structure to manipulate EDID fields.  is it worth submitting
that as a patch and union'ing that with the above?  not a big deal for
me either way.
