The thing is, it is really hard for anybody to change anything in page
reclaim or CPU scheduler. A few people saying a change is good for them
doesn't really mean anything because of the huge amount of diversity in
usages.
I've got my own CPU scheduler for 4 years and I and a few others think
it is better than mainline. I've tried to make many many VM changes
that haven't gone in.
Add to that, I don't actually know or care what sort of education most
kernel hackers have. I do know at least one of the more brilliant ones
does not have a CS degree, and I was able to get quite a few things in
before I had a degree (eg. rewrote IO scheduler and multiprocessor
CPU scheduler).

I don't know what would give anyone the idea that it isn't... patches
and numbers.
