From section 0 of the GPLv2:
The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on 
the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright 
law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either 
verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the 
term "modification".)
In other words, the "that is to say, a work containing the Program or a 
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into 
another language." is a clarification of the terms so that you do *NOT* have 
to know copyright law. However, the license, being based in copyright law, 
*CANNOT* change that law without making itself invalid. QED: What copyright 
law says is a "derivative work" is what matters, not the definition provided 
in the license.
