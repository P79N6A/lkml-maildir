hm.  spose so.

Where in the kernel is such a large number of 4-, 8- or 16-byte
objects being used?
The slab allocator will support caches right down to 1024 x 4-byte
objects per page.  Why is that not appropriate?
If it is for locality-of-reference between individual objects then
where in the kernel is this required, and are performance measurements
available?  It is very unusual to have objects which are so small,
and a better design would be to obtain the locality of reference
by aggregating the data into an array or structure.
Sorry, but you have what is basically a brand new allocator in
there, and we need a very good reason for including it.  I'd like
to know what that reason is, please.
