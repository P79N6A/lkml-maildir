It is the only sane way to synchronize the list manipulations.
There has to be a way for ->poll() to tell net_rx_action() two things:
1) How much work was completed, so we can adjust 'budget'
2) Was the NAPI quota exhausted?  So that we know that
   net_rx_action() still "owns" the polling context and
   thus can do the list manipulation safely.
And these both need to be encoded into one single return value, thus
the adopted convention that "work == weight" means that the device has
not done a NAPI complete.
