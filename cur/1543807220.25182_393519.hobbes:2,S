No, I don't think I ever used USB on this machine.  I did some more
tests based on what you said and have the following data points:
 - Having a USB device (USB stick) plugged in when booting doesn't
   make a difference.
 - When I load the de2104x driver _before_ uhci_hcd, both USB and
   Ethernet work fine.
 - Both modules load fine.  USB also works.  The problem only occurs
   when I actually try to use the Ethernet device (i.e. run DHCP).
   Then I get that traceback, and USB also stops working.
