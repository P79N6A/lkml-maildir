Hi again,
I've figured out a way to minimally modify RCU headers. If you still think
splitting RCU headers is a good idea, let me know, but this is meant to get
kmemtrace in Linus' tree as soon as possible.
I also renamed tracers as Pekka suggested.
Let me know what you think.
	Cheers,
	Eduard
Eduard - Gabriel Munteanu (2):
  RCU: Don't include unnecessary headers, allow kmemtrace w/
    tracepoints.
  kmemtrace: Use tracepoints instead of markers.
