They are all located at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/misc/2.6/sysfs-*-2.6.1.patch
I also have them in my own bk tree at:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net:/home/gregkh/linux/gregkh-2.6
but that tree is NOT parented off of Linus's bk tree, so odds are you
can not pull from it.  You can clone it if you really want to...
thanks,
