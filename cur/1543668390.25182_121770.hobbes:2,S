What happens if you boot without the cardbus card inserted?  If this
works, please send lspci -vv output.  What happens if you insert the
cardbus card?  If this works, again, please send the lspci -vv output.
Please send lspci -vv output under a kernel which works with the card
inserted.
(so you should have up to 3 lspci outputs to send me.)
Thanks.
