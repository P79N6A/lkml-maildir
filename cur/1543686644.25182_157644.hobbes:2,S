I will do that in my next build.  For some reason I wasn't sure if yenta
would handle 16-bit cards.  But this turns out not to be necessary.  Also
the PCMCIA suggestions which Felipe Alfaro Solana suggested (the suggestions
which I intended to try) turned out not to be necessary.  The winner is the
next one:
> I don't see any sign of cardmgr starting up in your message logs,
You're right.  I started it from the command line.  It didn't recognize the
existing card, but "cardctl eject 0" followed by "cardctl insert 0" taught it.
Now the question is why cardmgr doesn't start automatically in 2.6.0-test3.
In 2.4.19, PCMCIA support was a module, for which I guess I never bothered
to change SuSE's default.  In 2.6.0-test1 since had to set all options
myself, I compiled in PCMCIA support, and it's still that way in test3.
I'll try to see if I can find the reason, though of course you might be able
to guess it instantaneously.
Thank you.
