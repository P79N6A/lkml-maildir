Subject: 2.2.14: Inode leak?

I have an apparent inode leak in a 2.2.14 system.  Suspecting this, I
set up a cron job to monitor /proc/sys/fs/inode-nr.  Sure enough, each
half hour the total number of used inodes is creeeeeping up.
What are the tools I can use to track where those inodes are going?
