I guess this didn't help you either. But this night I got a bright idea,
or so I think, atleast. I'm actually using a KVM-switch, which I
ofcourse should have told you earlier, but it wasn't in my mind at all.
When not using the KVM switch, I get this message: 
input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x1c9, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.
Will this help?
Thanks.
Best regards,
