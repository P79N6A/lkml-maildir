This logic makes sense only if you have sort of firmware which
properly initializes the hotplug devices, so I think that the fixup
should belong in that particular hotplug driver (or architecture).
In general case the newly inserted device will have 0s in the BARs,
so there is no point for bus to CPU conversion. You have to use
pci_assign_resource() which does know about different address
spaces.

This one already exists - pcibios_resource_to_bus().
