I studied the slram.c and rd.c device drivers. The
ramdisk driver that I had written earlier, similar to
the above, had worked fine. With respect to PCI
express, I had to modify just the memory tranfer
function. The memcpy functions translate to byte
access. But, PCI express is dword access. So, I wrote
my own memory copy to do long read/write using
readl(), writel(). The block device driver works fine.
Thanks,
