OK, understood.

The problem is still that nothing says "oh, btw, I created 'xyz' tag for 
you" AFAICS?
IMO the user (GregKH and me, at least) just wants to know their set of 
tags and heads is up-to-date on local disk.  Wants to know what tags are 
out there.  It's quite annoying when two data sets are out of sync 
(.git/objects and .git/refs/tags).
Asking for the tag by name isn't useful at all, in that regard, because 
that requires that the user already know what tags are available.  To 
get that info, one must use rsync, gitweb, or a subscription to Psychic 
Friends Network.
