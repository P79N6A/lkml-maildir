The way I've gotten so-called proprietary information in the past is
to let the world know that "boneserver.analogic.com" 204.178.40.210 is
an open ftp site in which I don't even log what's uploaded and downloaded.
I check it once or twice a week to see if somebody has sent me anything
of interest. Sometimes, persons unknown to me, have deposited information
that I need. 
Now I seem to need some programming information on the Intel e-1000.
I'll keep you informed if anything turns up.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
