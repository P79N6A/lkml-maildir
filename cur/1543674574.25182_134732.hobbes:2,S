Hi.
I've got an old IDE disc (Quantum Maverick 270A) and it appears to be
detected OK, however I get about 15 hda: lost interrupt between
detection and printing the partition table (which seems to go OK).
this is on 2.5.69, with my own IDE driver (which I ported from 2.4.16)
any ideas? I heard 2.5 doesnt like some very old drives...
