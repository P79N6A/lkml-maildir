This seems wrong.
Remember that we are simply following the old pre-Pentium
naming tradition. Since the "Pentium 4" does not use the
old "P6" core (like the Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III,
and Celeron did) it is the next generation. It is a 786.
Intel will never release a 786. Why are we waiting for it?
Intel has, for the first time since the Pentium Pro, released
a completely new chip. This calls for a new number.
Following our convention, competing chips (from AMD, etc.)
get the 786 name if they implement nearly all new features
found on the Intel part.
