Look at stat.
In /usr/include/bits/stat.h:
struct stat
  {
    __dev_t st_dev;		/* Device.  */
...
#ifdef __USE_MISC
    /* Nanosecond resolution timestamps are stored in a format
       equivalent to 'struct timespec'.  This is the type used
       whenever possible but the Unix namespace rules do not allow the
       identifier 'timespec' to appear in the <sys/stat.h> header.
       Therefore we have to handle the use of this header in strictly
       standard-compliant sources special.  */
    struct timespec st_atim;		/* Time of last access.  */
    struct timespec st_mtim;		/* Time of last modification.  */
    struct timespec st_ctim;		/* Time of last status change.  */
# define st_atime st_atim.tv_sec	/* Backward compatibility.  */
# define st_mtime st_mtim.tv_sec
# define st_ctime st_ctim.tv_sec
#else
    __time_t st_atime;			/* Time of last access.  */
    unsigned long int st_atimensec;	/* Nscecs of last access.  */
    __time_t st_mtime;			/* Time of last modification.  */
    unsigned long int st_mtimensec;	/* Nsecs of last modification.  */
    __time_t st_ctime;			/* Time of last status change.  */
    unsigned long int st_ctimensec;	/* Nsecs of last status change.  */
#endif
