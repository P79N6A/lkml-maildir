That's usually an ACPI problem. Put full boot log of the failure
and acpidmp output into bugzilla.kernel.org
The difference between 32bit and 64bit distro is that the later
use the APIC by default so they are more sensitive to ACPI issues.

That sounds weird. Most likely a BIOS problem of some sort.
Dual or single channel memory shouldn't make a difference to the kernel.
