Right, as Mike just said, these warnings are the ones from
drivers/video/pvr2fb.c which the patch didn't touch ... that was only
to get rid of the "(between 'mv_dreamcast' and 'systemasic_int')"
warning. But of course, we can't be too sure about the patch till
you can boot and run the system ...
Meanwhile I'll look into Sam's suggestion and try to fix the pvr2fb
warnings too.

[ BTW I really wish someone from linux-sh would address that
.machvec.init vs .init.machvec section thing in the earlier mail. ]
