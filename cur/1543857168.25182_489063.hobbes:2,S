Subject: Obtaining a list of memory address ranges allocated to processes

I am trying to create a custom ELF and Windows PE loader for the purpose
of security research. I am having a difficult time finding how to
allocate memory for a binary at the desired address in memory
(especially if its non-relocatable). I would like to see why I cannot
get memory allocated at the exact address request in the binary headers.
Is there a program or system call that allows me to see a list of memory
address ranges allocated to the running processes on a system?
