While I definately want to support serial consoles and network logging
for large testing environments (like product testing), I also want LTP
to work on a single system environment.  I think that's important to
have for the average Linux hacker.  If Joe User finds a problem with in
the kernel I want him to be able to run LTP on his box to get detailed
testing information that someone else can analyze and use to solve the
problem.

That would be the easy case.  How do you reboot a locked machine over a
serial console?
