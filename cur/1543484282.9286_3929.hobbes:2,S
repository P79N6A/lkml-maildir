i dont think we can fault on it, it would be equally stupid by Intel. I
think we cannot switch off CPUID either. (only fault with #UD on CPUs that
have no cpuid) Also there are ways to detect an emulated CPUID as well. 
(but yes if we can fault on it then it's already much harder to write good
copy-protection ... huh, going offtopic fast ;)
