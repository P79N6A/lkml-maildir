Subject: List of undefined symbols in linux 2.3.31

	References to the undefined symbols i2o_event_register and
update_vm_cache have persisted in the 2.3.x kernels for a while now.
I understand that i2o support in 2.3.x is in flux right now, but
I am unclear on the situation with update_vm_cache.  If they
can safely just be deleted, then I would be happy to send a patch
to Linus if nobody else has bothered.
	The class to __divdi3 and __moddi3 in 2.3.x file system
modules are the results of a file system attempting to support
a block size that is not a power of two because recent 2.3.x
kernels support 64-bit offset in files (good) but do not
export the __divdi3 and __moddi3 routines necessary to support
division of 64 bit integers on 32 bit architectures (I don't know
why these routines are not exported from i386_ksyms.c, but I
had to drop arbitratry block size support from the iso9660
transparent compression patches to accomodate this).
	Anyhow, here is the list of currently undefined symbols
when 2.3.31 is compiled for x86 with everything being a module,
except for romfs and ramdisk, which are compiled in.  I hope this is
helpful in eliminating the undefined symbols from the kernel in
preparation for 2.4.
