Yes, I think that would provide a minimal fix to the problem.
(I'd prefer a solution in which presence on the LRU contributes
to page->count, because that means I can dump a load of expensive
page_cache_get-inside-lru-lock instances, but whatever)
You had:
-#define put_page_testzero(p)   atomic_dec_and_test(&(p)->count)
-#define page_count(p)          atomic_read(&(p)->count)
-#define set_page_count(p,v)    atomic_set(&(p)->count, v)
+#define put_page_testzero(p)   atomic_add_negative(-1, &(p)->count)
+#define page_count(p)          (1+atomic_read(&(p)->count))
+#define set_page_count(p,v)    atomic_set(&(p)->count, v-1)
+#define get_page_testzero(p)   atomic_inc_and_test(&(p)->count)
So the page count is actually offset by -1, and that is hidden by
the macros.  Fair enough.
atomic_add_negative() is not implemented on quite a number of
architectures (sparc64, mips, ppc, sh, cris, 68k, alpha..), so
some legwork is needed there.  Looks to be pretty simple though;
alpha, ppc and others already have atomic_add_return().
