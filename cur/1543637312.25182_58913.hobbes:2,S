Hello,
  is list_entry name really that bad? We have well established 
list_entry name since at least 2.2.0, and having two same functions 
with two different names will (IMHO) cause more damage than benefit 
from "clearer" name is.
                                        Thanks,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
P.S.: I converted whole matroxfb to use
list_entry(xxx, struct matrox_fb_info, fbcon) instead of
(struct matrox_fb_info*)xxx so that I can move fbcon field from 
first position in matrox_fb_info - so I'm personally interested
in backward source compatibility.
