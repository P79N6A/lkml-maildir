That seems like a dangerous assumption. If anything this needs to  be keyed
on specific PCI IDs.
And the way you coded a recursive PCI scan is just .... <looking for words, censoring
some that come to mind first> ... not nice.

Or just add a random generator and poke random bits? Should be roughly
equivalent.
Also there should be done anything here without confirmation from
Nvidia that HPET is actually supposed to work. Sometimes hardware
is disabled by BIOS because it is seriously broken (there was at least
one other chipset that could corrupt your flash if you force enabled
HPET in some steppings)
