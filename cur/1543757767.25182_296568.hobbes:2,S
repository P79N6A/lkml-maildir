Yes. HOWEVER - and note how firmware loading for this case is not validly
done at device discovery, but at "ifconfig" time.
Ie device discovery (probing) is a _separate_ phase entirely, and happens 
much earlier. We should initialize the hardware only when it actually gets 
"acively used" some way by user space.
