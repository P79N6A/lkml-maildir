Hi,
a similar problem here on a Targa XP.
The wheel of the touchpad is on /dev/input/event0 and /dev/psaux
The touchpad and the regular buttons are on /dev/input/event1
This is kind of strange.
dmesg:
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: PC Speaker
i8042.c: Detected active multiplexing controller, rev 1.0.
serio: i8042 AUX0 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
 Firware: 4.1
 Sensor: 8
 new absolute packet format
input: Synaptics Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio2

serio: i8042 AUX2 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12

input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
and later on:
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte

Synaptics driver resynced.
