Well, so it does.

I see. I'll avoid that in the future.

What wasn't obvious to me from these documents is that the "---" path
must also be "-p1 conforming" (so to say), as the "patch -p1" command
itself only requires that for the "+++" path.
Unfortunately I can't think of a wording that would have prevented that
misunderstanding for me. Perhaps a native English speaker might come up
with something.
Thanks
