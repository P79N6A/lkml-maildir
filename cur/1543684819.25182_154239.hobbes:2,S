Find for one. Any application that must scan the tree in a search. Any 
application that must backup every file for another (I know, dump bypasses
the filesystem to make backups, tar doesn't).
tar, cpio, rm
fsck for another...
ls for another.. (ls -R)
The problem is backward links. If the forward link to a directory points to a 
directory above the entry for that link will cause a failure.
Another problem is reverse links...
for example:
	a/b/c		and
	a/b/d		are in the same directory b, (c and d are both directories)
	a/e/f		is hardlinked to the directory d.
current directory is in "f".
How do you address "../c" ?
I've used systems that allowed this (VMS was one, though it wasn't really
documented). The filesystem repair utilitity insisted that "directory was
not properly linked...", and any attempt to fix it caused the other link
to show up as "not properly".
It introduces too many unique problems to be easily handled. That is why
symbolic links actually work. Symbolic links are not hard links, therefore
they are not processed as part of the tree. and do not cause loops.
It was also done in one of the "popular" code management systems under
unix. (it allowed a "mount" of the system root to be under the CVS
repository to detect unauthorized modifications...). Unfortunately,
the system could not be backed up anymore. 1. A dump of the CVS filesystem
turned into a dump of the entire system... 2. You could not restore the
backups... The dumps failed (bru at the time) because the pathnames got
too long, the restore failed since it ran out of disk space due to the
multiple copies of the tree being created.
The KIS principle is the key. A graph is NOT simple to maintain.
