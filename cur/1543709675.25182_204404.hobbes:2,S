I don't know about the current, but one or two versions back when I
tested the last time it printed something about unknown key for the
whole dmesg and couldn't find /dev/hd{b,c}. After investigations the
hard-drives had changed place for some reason (Not swapped place, but
they were in a weird location, can't recall which).
I'll try the new one when I have time to boot this one.
