For most kernel interface daemons, that is not an option.  You need to
be able to translate (or just transfer information) between
glibc-provided and kernel-provided data structures, so you need to be
able to include all the datatypes.
Let's get this straight: #include <linux/*> and #include <asm/*> are
*expected* to be the kernel headers.  This is a completely different
issue from the fact that glibc headers shouldn't #include these
headers like libc5 did.
