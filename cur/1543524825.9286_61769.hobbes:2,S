Rui, I dont know if you got your answer yet or not but the boot-time accounting of
memory utilization changed between 2.2 and 2.3.   As memory is allocated by the
kernel at boot time it is marked as "reserved".  In 2.2 that reserved memory is
carefully
divided into "kernel code", "data", "init" and what is left over is "reserved".
In 2.3
memory that is allocated at boot time is still marked as "reserved" but the "data"
size
only includes the data section of the vmlinux kernel itself, not what is allocated
at boot
time by the kernel.  This accounts for most of the larger "reserved" size in 2.3,
then
the additional 2MB is just a larger overall kernel.  Perhaps there were more
modules
in your 2.2 than there is in your 2.3 kernel configuration.
