Hi Alan,
here is the promised minor page aging update to 2.4.9-ac15:
1) use min()/max() for age_page_{up,down}, now the
   thing is resistant to people changing PAGE_AGE_DECL ;)
2) in try_to_swap_out(), still adjust the page age even if
   the zone does have enough inactive pages ... this is a
   very cheap operation and will keep the page aging info
   in zones better up to date
3) only call do_try_to_free_pages() when we have a free
   shortage, this means kswapd() won't waste CPU time on
   working sets which fit in memory, but "spill over"
   into the inactive list ... also update comments a bit
4) remove run_task_queue(&tq_disk) from kswapd() since
   page_launder() will already have done this if needed
regards,
Rik
