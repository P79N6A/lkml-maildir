Or if you don't like using bitkeeper, use the latest -mm release.  All
of the changes in my tree are in there.
Honestly, I don't see how some of these issues started showing up
between those two kernel releases.  You can see the only changes made in
the USB section broken out by patch at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/2.6/2.6.6-rc2/
If you want, try reversing those patches one by one against 2.6.6-rc3 to
see which one caused the problems.
thanks,
