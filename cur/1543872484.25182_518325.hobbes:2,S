yes, but that might as well be fatal, because now the
children can easily DoS the parent by using up all the
file handles, where the 'original' setup (2 x 256)
left 512 file handles 'reserved' ...
of course, you could as well have adjusted that to
2 x 128 + 256 for the parent, but that is policy and
IMHO policy does not belong into the kernel, it should
be handled by userspace (maybe invoked by the kernel
in some kind of helper functionality or so)

which was quite intentional, and brings us to another
issues when adjusting resource limits (not even in
a hierarchical way)

btw, kicking out pages when rss limit is reached might
be the obvious choice (if we think Virtual Machine here)
but it might not be the best choice from the overall
performance PoV, which might be much better off by
keeping the page in memory (if there is enough memory
available) but penalizing the guest like the page was
actually kicked out (and needs to be fetched later on)
note: this is something we should think about when we
want to address specific limits like RSS, because IMHO
we should not optimize for the single guest case, but
for the big picture ...

we do not want to duplicate any information in the task
struct, but we might want to put some (or maybe all)
of the spaces back (as pointer reference) to the task
struct, just to avoid the nsproxy indirection
note that IMHO not all spaces make sense to be separated
e.g. while it is quite useful to have network and pid
space separated, others might be joined to form larger
consistant structures ...
for example, I could as well live with pid and resource
accounting/limits sharing one common struct/space ...
(doesn't mean that separate spaces are not nice :)
