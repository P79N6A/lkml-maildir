Actually, it's an 1575D.

No Linux on that machine, thus no lspci but something similar:
 Vendor 1045h OPTi Inc
 Device C701h 82C701 FireStar Plus CPU to PCI Bridge
 Subsystem ID 0E1103F4h Compaq Armarda
 Vendor 1045h OPTi Inc
 Device C700h 82C700 FireStar PCI to ISA Bridge
 Subsystem ID 0E1103F4h Compaq Armarda
 Vendor 1045h OPTi Inc
 Device D568h 82C825 FireBridge II PCI EIDE Controller
 Subsystem ID 0E1103F4h Compaq Armada
This should be supported by the opti621 driver.
With these devices
disk :IBM-DKLA-23240  (primary master) running at MWord DMA2/PIO4 
cdrom:UJDA120         (primary slave)  running at PIO4
the chipset shuld be programmed like this:

If you like to run the disk at ultra DMA mode 0, then it looks like
this:
