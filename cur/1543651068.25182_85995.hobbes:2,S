But you've inlined them again.  Your patches increase my kernel
size by 17 kbytes, which is larger than my entire Layer 1 instruction
cache!
I'd prefer that we have these functions in .c, and laid out with
a minimum of C tricks.  Because more work needs to be done on the
memory copy functions, and doing that in header files is a pain.
(That is, using the movnta instructions for well-aligned copies
and clears so that we don't read the destination memory while overwriting
it).
Hopefully, yes, we can end up removing the runtime-selectable alignment
mask.  I left that in at present because it provides the infrastructure
for making other runtime-selectable decisions about how to perform
copies and clears.  Distributors like to be able to ship a minimum
number of kernels (say, just a PII-compiled kernel) and we want those
to run as well as possible on PIII and P4.
