if it's legal it's legal. it's not a matter of the Linux community being 
satisfied eith it, it's a matter of the BSD people desiring it based on 
their selection of license (and the repeated statements that this feature 
of the BSD license being an advantage compared to the GPL makes it clear 
that this isn't an unknown side effect, it's an explicit desire).
so the Linux community is following the desires of the BSD community by 
following their license but the BSD community is unhappy, why?
you claim that it's unethical for the linux community to use the code, but 
brag about NetApp useing the code. what makes NetApp ok and Linux evil? 
many people honestly don't understand the logic behind this. please 
explain it.
if you don't like what your license allows, change it. it's trivial for 
you to do so, all you need to do is to agree on a new license and start 
releaseing your code under it (the BSD license allows for derivitive works 
to be released under any license) make the new license match your real 
desires and this sort of problem can be avoided in the future.
