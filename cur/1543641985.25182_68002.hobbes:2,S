Yes it does. I've checked! Well, at least I've checked that writing
then reading causes the reads to get to the device driver. I haven't
checked what reading twice does.
If it doesn't cause the data to be read twice, then it ought to, and
I'll fix it (given half a clue as extra pay ..:-)

Well, let's take things one at a time. Put in a VFS mechanism and then
convert some FSs to use it.

I intend to make the generic mechanism attractive.

Why? Are you advocating a particular approach? Yes, I agree that that
is a possible way to go - but I will want the extra VFS ops anyway, 
and will want to modify the particular fs to use them, no?
