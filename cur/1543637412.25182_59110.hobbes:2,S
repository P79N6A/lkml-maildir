It's an absolute must-have feature.  Too many users send in
undecoded or wrongly decoded oopses and we end up spending
too much time trying to teach users how to decode oopses.
Add to that the fact that symbols from modules aren't always
looked up allright.
Having the kernel print out the function symbol and offset
into the function would save us a lot of time and trouble
in tracking down problems.

Rik
