Per-extent checksums on ext4 might work better.
        -  If you only changed a small part of a file the majority of
           checksums would still be valid.
        -  On a file with 31K of data in a 128K extent, checksumming
           the wasted space might cause false positives but it would be
           OK because that would still be actual on-disk corruption.
