That was not really my intention to allocate variable size buffers -
it's perfectly Ok for me to have 2 fixed-size pools. What I meant was to
allocate buffers with some kind of header containing buffer size and
type of buffer or whatever needed info. Obviously, you could use
pointers to buffer body all over the code, functions/macros that need to
access the header would move the pointer back by sizeof(header). Then
one could e.g. provide a single function for disposing the buffer, and
no longer care which pool is it allocated from, for the additional
memory cost - the function would look into the header to check that for
you. Hope it's clear now (my English is far from perfect).
