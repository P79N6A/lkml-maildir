Yes, but on the other side: except of this single shift in the registers, it 
works in the m41txx (or what the name will be) and won't do any extra work to 
the driver.
Even the m41t80 and m41t81 differs in their features. So you always have to 
distinguish inside the driver.

My target is a M41ST85.

There are also M41st9x chips and M41t6x chips and a M41t11... But ok, most 
difference is watchdog/alarm or not.

As long, as the user will be pointed out this possibilties in the Kconfig - I 
agree.
