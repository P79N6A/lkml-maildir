It did not help :( I had to disable CONFIG_PREEMPT to shut it up.
I had:
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y
CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
It did what I wrote.
Then I had:
CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
#CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y
#CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT=y
and I had the same (or similar messages)
Now I have disabled all the preempt stuff and it is ok. (but not ok with
allocation failure, see next mail)
