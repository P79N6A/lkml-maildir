Sure.  Although I thought it was no problem because coremask uses only
1 bit, it will be problematic when coremask grows beyond byte alignment.

So I'm going to use a bit field to store the bitmask. Because of this,
I can't use an atomic_t variable.
Instead, I'll use a spin lock to read/write atomically.
