So write your own replacement. linux-kernel is not a free service to
mitigate your laziness or lack of programming skills.
What you require can be accomplished with a ~10 line C program. This
program can be compiled once and included in your tools
distribution. A kernel level replacement would probably be no smaller
or faster and would thus offer none of the "advantages" that you 
proclaim.
