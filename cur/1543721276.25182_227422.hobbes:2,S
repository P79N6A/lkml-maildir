FYI.
I have a box here that was originally running 2.4.x.  I updated to 
2.6.x a few months ago, and all was well.  Then I started to get 
curious oops, none of them the same.
I started to suspect NFS, as I use an old 486 to hold the web pages 
to serve to the box via NFS... the oops occurred every Saturday 
morning @ 4:02.  Lead to me think it was some sort of cron.weekly 
issue with the disc activity and file access or the like, or 
whatever... I didn't know - I was on a fishing exercise (and a lot of 
searching on the LKML)
But, after talking to a member of the HantsLUG, and showing logs and 
stuff, he brought up at the swap size.  This box was once 64Mb, but 
is now 128Mb - with 128Mb swap.  I created an additional swap file 
(256Mb), and (touch wood), no oops since, all heathly :)  I never 
looked at this before, as swap was never used _during_ normal running 
of the box, but as he said maybe the cron.weekly ran a lot of stuff 
that did use it up...
