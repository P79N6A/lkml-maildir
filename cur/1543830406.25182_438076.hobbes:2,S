There were _no_ kernel messages just before the oops. Not even with USB 
debugging turned on. Of course, they may have been marked "informational", 
and not shown on the console. Every distribution seems to think that debug 
messages are more annoying than useful, so they tend to set the console 
debug level down (even if you boot with "debug" to turn it on!). Gaah!
