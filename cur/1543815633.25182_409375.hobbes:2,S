That's bascially sizeof(spinlock_t).  That's architecture dependent and
varies wildly according to the day of week.
It _might_ work in all situations - probably you checked that.  But I still
wouldn't do it because it might break in the future.  Let's be explicit and
stick the appropriate ifdefs in there.
I'd also consider renaming it to files_shared() - processes are
multithreaded, not data structures.
Once you're done with that we should change fget_light() and fput_light() to
use this helper.  Separate patch.
