Yes, I tried these slightly different combinations:
s2ram -f -a3 -s: Works! The screen becomes green but is restored quickly. It 
prints the following messages:
Allocated buffer at 0x11000 (base is 0x0)
ES: 0x1100 EBX: 0x0000
Save video state failed
Calling restore_state_from
Function not supported?
Restore video state failed
Switching back to vt1
s2ram -f -a3 -p: Screen goes green and then blank. Everything hangs, doesn't 
react to keyboard input.
s2ram -f -a3 -m: Works!
(Tested with 2.6.21-rc7.)
Thanks,
Marcus
