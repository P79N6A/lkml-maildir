Did you unpack this from a .bz2 download?  Such as this is why I always 
go get the .gz versions. It just built flawlessly here, 8 warnings in 
the apm stuffs we've been looking at for years.  Fixing to reboot to it 
right now. brb.
Done, booted to it.
I scraped this from the login screen:  But it won't paste, darn.
Something about bus methods used by the w83627hf driver I think.  Is 
this supposedly being migrated to the SPI bus?  If so, howto swap 
the .config stuufs to do that?
FWIW, sensors is displaying via gkrellm just fine for the moment.
Also, its nice to see 1GB of low mem registered now.  Thanks.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
