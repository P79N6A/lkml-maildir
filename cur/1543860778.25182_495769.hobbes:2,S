Yes.  For 2.6.21.  As I've always said.
But for 2.6.20, we are only HALFWAY there, and all these /new/ bugs 
exist as a result.
Your patch makes far more sense for 2.6.21, where the "halfway to 
salvation" state, and associated rough edges, is not exposed to users.
Fixing the resource tree was only half the solution, since the drivers 
that /use/ the resource tree now need updating.
