Dear oh dear.  I was under the impression that kernel semaphores are
supposed to be used as mutexes only -- there are other mechanisms for
signalling between processes.
Do any processes ever enter userspace holding a critical semaphore?
(Things like userspace signalling another userspace don't count -- it's
your own fault and your own problem if _that_ deadlocks).
