Who's to say you will always own the stack in the Linux kernel, or
have the right to make such a statement?

And if as Joe User I don't want Linux TCP, but Joe's TCP, they can't
do that (in a supportable way)?  Are you saying Linux is, "do it my
way, or it's the highway"?
Seems rather Microsoft-ish of an attitude, if you ask me.
I think this is EXACTLY the reason why you run into companies like
Caldera and Microsoft saying that Linux stifles innovation.  You say,
"Oh, we allow you to do whatever you want", and when someone really
does want to do that in a way that works for open source and for
proprietary/high-security developers, you slam the door in their face.
Quite a shame.
Take it easy,
