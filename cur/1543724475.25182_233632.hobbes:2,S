With the 2.6 kernel I expected that my boxes would be responsive under 
heavy loads such as exacted by updatedb. What I'm finding is that when 
updatedb and other heavy hitters are running, I'm often unable to switch 
desktops or start other tasks. I'm currently using 2.6.7-mm1, but this 
has been true for all 2.6 kernels. I have CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, 
/proc/sys/kernel/kernel_preemption doesn't exist.
SuSE 9.1, Athlon XP2800+, 512M.
Regards
Sid.
