Just use MAP_32BIT

On x86-64 an mmap extension for that would be fine, but on i386 you get
problems because mmap64() already maxes out the argument limit and you 
cannot add more.
You could only implement it with a structure in memory pointed to by an
argument, which would be ugly.
prctl is probably better. You really want [start; end] right ? 
Pity that task_struct is already so bloated, so every new entry hurts.
