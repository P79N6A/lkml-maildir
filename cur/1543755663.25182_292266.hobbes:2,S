,,backlight changes'' - that interests me. My ibook g4 1.2GHz right now can 
sleep and wake up sometimes (with additional patch) but the backlight doesn't 
turn on or is very, very dark and I can't make it lighter from keyboard. Is 
this change related to such problems?
Generic question - how does suspend to ram/suspend to disk looks for ibook g4 
in current Linus and mm kernels?
