Kinda, yes.
I'm trying to evaluate if the behaviour I'm seeing is expected, which
would heavily influence my choice of hardware/software for future
projects (and of course to optimize the current setup).
Currently I'm having problems capturing packets with tcpdump (lots of
"packets dropped by kernel") which indicates to me that there's
genuinely not much (enough) idle time sitting around.

Will do, that could take a couple of days though.
