Well, I get no warning from the following code, with gcc 3.2.2 and -W -Wall:
int foo(int x)
{
   int y, z, w;
   asm("movl %1,%0" : "=r" (y) : "r" (x));
   asm("movl %1,%0" : "=r" (z) : "m" (y+1));
   asm("movl %1,%0" : "=r" (w) : "m" (33));
   return z+w;
}
The memory operand is definitely not an lvalue.  gcc allocates a stack slot
for the y+1 value as a temporary automatic and passes it in.  The value 33
is put in the .rodata segment:
00000000 <foo>:
    0:   55                      push   %ebp
    1:   89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
    3:   50                      push   %eax
    4:   8b 45 08                mov    0x8(%ebp),%eax
    7:   89 c0                   mov    %eax,%eax
    9:   40                      inc    %eax
    a:   89 45 fc                mov    %eax,0xfffffffc(%ebp)
    d:   8b 15 00 00 00 00       mov    0x0,%edx
                         f: R_386_32     .rodata.cst4
   13:   8b 45 fc                mov    0xfffffffc(%ebp),%eax
   16:   01 d0                   add    %edx,%eax
   18:   c9                      leave
   19:   c3                      ret

That would be a very bad thing indeed.  Fortunately I think it would take
some rather odd contortions on the part of the compiler for that situation
to occur at all, I would think, and if the gcc people have since been
made aware of it it should be pretty easy for them to make sure it will not
happen.
