As I said on IRC, my main concern is exposing PF_MEMALLOC to user-space
at all.
I'm sure you have good programmers that write perfect user-space
code. But once the thing is out there, there is little to no control.
Of course, once root, trashing your box isn't hard, but lets not make
it easier.
The iSCSI daemon was mlockall but only communicated with the kernel
using netlink, so by sprinkling pixie dust on the netlink code one can
inject user-space policy stuffs in a safe way.
