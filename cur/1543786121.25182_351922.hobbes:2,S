sdparm is a command line utility designed to get and set
SCSI device parameters (cf hdparm for ATA disks). Apart
from SCSI devices (e.g. disks, tapes and enclosures) sdparm
can be used on any device that uses a SCSI command set.
Virtually all CD/DVD drives use the SCSI MMC set irrespective
of the transport. sdparm also can decode VPD pages including
the device identification page. Commands to start and stop
the media; and load and unload removable media are supported.
sdparm can be used in both the lk 2.4 and 2.6 series.
This release adds the decoding of 5 more Vital Product Data
(VPD) pages. Most of the rest of the changes are bug fixes.
