} Correct. The last v should be replaced with whatever that we got from
} (v)>(max)?(max):(v), like:
} 
} #define FIT(v,min,max) (((v)>(max)?(max):(v))<(min)?(min):((v)>(max)?(max):(v)))
} 
} Or perhaps this is a lot better:
} 
} #define FIT(v,min,max) ((v)>(max)?(max):((v)<(min)?(min):(v)))
} 
*pukes*
Wouldn't an inline'd function be much much more readable/maintainable??
