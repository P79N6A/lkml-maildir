Some people consider modules derivative works, since they link with
pieces of the kernel.  Distributing derivative works are considered
distributing the original work, which means the GPL applies to the
result.

devfs had issues.  Someone (Greg) provided something better.  devfs went
away when nothing in the kernel needed it anymore.  That something
outside the kernel was using devfs, well who cares.  That is the outside
code's problem if they don't keep up.  If they happen to have any issues
with the replacement system, then that too is their problem and only
their problem.
