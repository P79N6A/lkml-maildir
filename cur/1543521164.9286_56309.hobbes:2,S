there is still a huge market for old x86 chips... even secondhand. Now think
of all the other 8/16 bit arch's targetted at embedded market.

64 bit chip needs significantly more gates than a 32bit one. and hence will
draw exponentially more power, unless it's made with a significantly higher
tech process -> which means cost. Bus interface is another factor.
old chips have a minimal (even free) design cost. Fab is cheap cause you can
use an out-of-date process. Yield is very high because the process is well
tested and understood.
cheap... cheap.. cheap...

so you think that 4/8/16 bit chips aren't shipping in volume today? You
think that only the state-of-the-art has volume? You are mistaken, it's the
other way around.

sorry, but you are extrapolating based on trends in
workstation/desktop/server CPU. Embedded is a totally different ball game.
Anyway, as you and others have said, there is no crystal ball. We can't know
whether 32bit chips will still be in use by 2038. However we can prepare for
that eventuality.
So let's leave it at that.
