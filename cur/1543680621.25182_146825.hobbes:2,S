Yes. I have sent patches to Linus several times, the latest one today.
So far he has been dropping my patches on the floor.
So far our 2.5 tree doesn't have a USB driver because I 
would like to wait until the USB framework is less volatile.
In my mind we will port the USB driver somewhere around
2.6.0.

Speaking of older kernels, any chances for a 2.5 update?  I know the
CRIS USB host controller driver has fallen pretty out of date with the
rest of the USB core, and would hope to see that sync up sometime.
