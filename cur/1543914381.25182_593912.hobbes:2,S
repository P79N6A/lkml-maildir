Ah - i have messed up my sched-devel.git script so the git-push went to 
kernel.org but into my home directory :-/ Should work now - let me know 
if it doesnt.
i've also uploaded the patch series in quilt format, to:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/devel/patches.tar.gz

i'm not sure what you mean, but i can definitely tell you that there was 
no scheduler hacking at the Kernel Summit. (there's no good wireless in 
the pubs and not enough space for a laptop anyway ;)
The impressive linecount has been mostly achieved by dumb removal:
    sched: remove wait_runtime fields and features
    4 files changed, 14 insertions(+), 161 deletions(-)
    sched: remove wait_runtime limit
    5 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 124 deletions(-)
    sched: remove precise CPU load calculations #2
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 31 deletions(-)
    sched: remove precise CPU load
    3 files changed, 9 insertions(+), 41 deletions(-)
    sched: remove stat_gran
    4 files changed, 15 insertions(+), 50 deletions(-)
Hack time to do them: ~10 minutes apiece. Removing stuff is _easy_ :-)
The rest is finegrained, small changes. One of the harder patches was 
this one:
    commit 28c4b8ed35f0fc7050f186147da9e10b55e1e446
    sched: introduce se->vruntime
    3 files changed, 50 insertions(+), 33 deletions(-)
And i sent you the first variant of that already:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/2/76
we needed 2 days after the KS to put it into shape and send it out for 
feedback.
