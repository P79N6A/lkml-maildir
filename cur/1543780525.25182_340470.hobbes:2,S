Hello,
When creating a workqueue, workqueue name is limited to 10 chars
(kernel/workqueue.c , function is __create_workqueue, test is done in a BUG_ON).
Why has this length be limited to 10 chars ?
Can I safely increase this max length (13 chars should be enough...) ?
Some comments about these questions:
In SCSI layer, HBA kernel ID is incremented after each modprobe/rmmod.
Then, when a scsi driver is managing a working queue and HBA kernel ID is 
greater than 99 (let's assume that you have modprobe/rmmod the scsi driver to 
get this ID to 99, or you may have play with 'scsi_debug' module), an oops is 
generated when loading again the driver (and the driver is frozen).
This is because working queue name format is "scsi_wq_%d" (drivers/scsi/hosts.c 
, function scsi_add_host, %d is the HBA ID), and so working queue name length is 
greater than 10 chars when HBA kernel ID is > 99...
Best regards
