I have had this for many months on many kernels, but not on early
2.1.x kernels. Unloading and reloading the entire ISDN module tree
clears the problem. See many previous posts, including tcpdumps.
For a while around 2.2.0 it seemed to go away. Andi Kleen was very
helpful in narrowing down what was happening, but perhaps we should
find the most appropriate isdn4linux developer's address and forward
a concise summary?
