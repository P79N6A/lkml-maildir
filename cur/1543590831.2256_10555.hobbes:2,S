Hmmm... I don't see how not touching buffer values can solve his
problem at all.  His MTU is really HUGE, and in this case 300 byte
packet eats 10k or so space in receive buffer.
I doubt our buffer size tuning algorithms can cope with this.
Really, copy threshold in driver just must be choosen carefully.
