Now _that_ sounds good. :-)

I like this idea very much.
So, to fix the issue at hand, I'd like the $subject patch to go first.  Then,
there is a major update of the new framework waiting for .29 in the Greg's
tree (that's the main reason why nobody uses it so far, BTW) and I'd really
prefer it to go next.  After it's been merged, I'm going to add the mandatory
suspend-resume things (save state and go to a low power state on suspend,
restore state on resume) to the new framework in a separete patch.
Is this plan acceptable?
