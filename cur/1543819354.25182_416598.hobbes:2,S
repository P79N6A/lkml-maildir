We'll read/write doesn't work well with PI (or latencies for that
matter).  But rw_locks have one advantage over normal rt_mutex, and that
is they are self recursive.  i.e. one rw_lock can be taken over and over
again (as read) by the same process, as long as it releases it the same
amount of times.
