I post the patch very quickly :(. The original code finally seems OK. My 
controller is not working with 39 bit addressing, although I can't find 
why the compiler warns. Maybe the length of dma_addr_t type, in the 
2.6.9 the type of the mask_39bit variable is bus_addr_t.
Forget the patch. I'll continue looking...
Thanks and excuse the inconvenience.
Cheers,
MaF
