ok, thanks - this pinpointed the problem. I have just sent the fix for 
that (against -mm3), does your networking card still work with that 
patch applied, and if yes, is the lock validator silent on your box now? 
Btw., the easiest way to find out whether there's a lockdep problem on 
your box is to grep for debug_locks in /proc/lockdep_stats - it should 
still be on 1. If there's a warning, it goes to 0. That is an easy to 
script flag.

heh ;) Yeah. But it does tell us everything (and much more) about the 
immediate history of any particular bug.
