We are seeing this too, particularly [IIRC exclusively]
on MIPS and PPC though there isn't any obvious target
architecture correlation.  It appears to be a false
positive as the system seems otherwise responsive to
general scheduling.  It's on my list to address but not
a priority just yet.
Adding a sched pri/policy printk to show_task() and
inserting a call to show_state() in the softlockup
detect routine should shed some light.
