You have a very good point; indeed since we don't export an interface
which allows userspace to determine whether or not a block is in use,
that does mean a huge amount of churn in the page cache.  So maybe it
would be worth doing in the kernel as a result, although the libc
implementation still wouldn't be able to go away for long time due to
the need to be backwards compatible with older kernels that didn't
have this support.
