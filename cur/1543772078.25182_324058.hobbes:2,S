I just found the time to test your latest patch (sorry for the delay).
However, it doesn't seem to help.
First of all, I verified that your code is indeed being called. That
does occur.  Specifically, resources cannot be allocated for the
following bridges and regions:
  0000:00:01.0, region #10
  0000:00:1c.0, regions #7,8,9,10
  0000:00:1c.1, regions #7,8,9,10
  0000:00:1c.2, regions #7,8,9,10
  0000:02:00.0, regions #7,8,9,10
  0000:03:05.0, regions #7,8,9,10
  0000:00:1e.0, regions #7,8,9,10
  0000:06:09.0, regions #7,8,9,10
  0000:06:09.1, regions #7,8,9,10
  0000:06:09.3, regions #7,8,9,10
However, after pci_assign_unassigned_resources() has been called, the
MEM and PREFETCH regions of the bridge 0000:00:1e.0 (bridge 1) _remain_
invalid at 0x00000000.
The boot hangs (as before) when attempting to start the CardBus
controller in the dock.
If you need further info, please let me know.
