Hmm. Maybe there is a possibility to do some addition to 2.2 to list
interface
aliases in some special /proc file? Like /proc/aliases?
The reason for this is that calling ioctl from e.g. perl is not, err,
convinient :)
I can live without /proc/aliases, although I would be a lot more happier
person if
they existed.
The main 2.2 showstopper is changed firewall semantics - i.e. no way
ipchains
interface IP instead of interface name. This stops me from putting 2.2
on
PPP serving boxes, as well as poses even troubles on multihomed host,
where I
neither easily can get listed of interface aliases nor configure
ipchains with an
IP directly. :)

I'm not sure, but some people experienced this bug as well (there is a
small thread
about this on linux-kernel), and some guy posted a message this is known
by
developers and will be fixed in the next net-tools. So I'm waiting for
them now.

Well, I installed the new version (0.98 made by some other guy than
original
author) and its working ok now. Stock 0.16 didn't, though, and kernel
was
constantly telling that it used some obsolete feature.

That is good news - I also hope your gii patch will make it into 3.5.x
branch as
well ;)
