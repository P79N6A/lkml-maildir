My request was that we shouldn't assume an architecture will have a
'struct page' corresponding to whatever it chooses to return from
dma_alloc_coherent(). 
There are machines where DMA to/from main memory _cannot_ be coherent
but we have some memory elsewhere, perhaps some SRAM which itself is
hanging off an I/O bus somewhere, which can be used. One of my toys is
currently running with dma_alloc_coherent() giving out memory from a PCI
video card, in fact.
Using a PFN should be OK.
