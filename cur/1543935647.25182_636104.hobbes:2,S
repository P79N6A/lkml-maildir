I don't see mmiotrace getting merged into a stable kernel... how do 
however see it getting cleaned up for 2.6.25 now that people know how 
fragile the kernel hooks for it are..

(I think the other mystery feature is actually a Novell kernel debugger 
but I'm not sure, madwifi use it for similiar reasons to mmiotrace I 
think..)

Subject: [patch 20/38] Minor fault path optimization.

was a patch to do exactly that.. hch decided the feature wasn't useful and 
posted a patch to remove it..

Jan first complained on the 4th Decemeber last year, I'm just posting this 
now because Linus said send him a patch to revert regressions rather than 
just complain, I've prepared the patch to put back the old behaviour from 
2.6.23. This was only brought to my notice this morning but I'm not going 
to let that stop me from trying to find a correct fix rather than just 
ripping the feature out..
I think we could apply the page fault cleanup patch I mentioned earlier on 
top of this patch and get back the 300 cycles and that would make people 
happy, it makes sense for mmiotrace to use kprobes hooks and not have to 
do this stuff directly but if that is what is wanted the mmiotrace guys 
can do it directly in the future.
