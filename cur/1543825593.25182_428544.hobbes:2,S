Good catch,
I suspect the reason why the problem never showed up is because select_parent()
would take care of ensuring that the parent entries move to LRU list (this is
the case of regular umounts, which do not call shrink_dcache_sb() directly).
Maybe even the dentry_unused list should be per-superblock now.
