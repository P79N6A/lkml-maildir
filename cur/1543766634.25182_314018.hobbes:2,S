Does anyone have . in their $PATH? I've only used the commit-id that I
installed previously. Since the tarball doesn't have a .git directory, the
only way you end up building cogito from a directory with a repository is
by using an earlier cogito or something of the sort, in which case, you
probably have the program.
In any case, commit-id isn't actually necessary for this operation.

We don't necessarily have commit-id available when building. Furthermore,
we don't necessarily have a repository. Just put in .git/HEAD if it
exists; otherwise, it's a base distribution.
