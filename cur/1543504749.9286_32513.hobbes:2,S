Feature freeze in about two weeks is the current plan.
In short, people who think they have major requirements had better get
their act together. That means that if ISDN people actually want to try to
get into a real release one of these years, they don't have all that much
time to futz around any more.
And it does mean that if it's not in working order already, it probably
won't make it into 2.4.
