Subject: 4K stack overflow with nfs3, reiserfs, dm and raid1

4K stacks still overflow:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=237276
Just trying to dump the stack trace when that happens causes an oops,
and there's no good way to prevent that. In fact it's probably the
best thing to do anyway.
You can tell something Really Bad has happened because of this:
> Process nfsd (pid: 2815, ti=f3f49000 task=f582d7b0 task.ti=f3f4a000)
Note that ti and task.ti don't agree.
P. S. Does reiserfs really need to use that much stack?
