spin lock is a nop on uniprocessor. That is much of the point of this. Most
ne2000's are in uniprocessor boxes so they are primary target

Wrong. There are multiple 100Mbit NE2000 clones (notably PCMCIA ones). I
have one in my laptop for example.

I dont believe anyone has tested the driver hard with pre-empt. Its not that
this driver can't be fixed. Its that this is one tiny example of maybe 
thousands of other similar flaws lurking. There is no obvious automated way
to find them either.

I don't hold the lock with interrupts off for several milliseconds
