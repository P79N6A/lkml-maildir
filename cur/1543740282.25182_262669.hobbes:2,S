In my view (and apparently others, as has been verified in current apps using 
blocking sockets), current behaviour *does* break the documented interface.
The man page for select says:
"Those  listed  in  readfds  will  be watched  to  see if characters become 
available for reading (more precisely, to see if a read will not block..."
If I'm the only one touching the socket, select returns with it readable, and I 
block when calling recvmsg, then by definition that behaviour does not match the 
documented interface.
