Okay. So they give everyone the right to change the software on the box, but 
on connection replace the modified stuff with the official versions. Is that 
still a copyright problem? Absolutely, positively no. Is the current 
situation any different? Not that I can tell - they've changed a reaction 
into a preemptive act.

Okay - "nonsense" in this sense meaning "it proves me wrong, but I can't be 
wrong, so it has no real meaning." I can accept that.

But the mangling method isn't proprietary. What is proprietary is a number 
that is input to a step of the process. (AFAICT the signing process is done 
with proprietary tools, but the process itself isn't)
