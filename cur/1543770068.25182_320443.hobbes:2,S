That's a good reason why it should be included. The maintainers know
that as developers there is no way for us to flush out all the bugs in
our code by ourselves. If the RT patch was added to -mm it would have
greatly increased coverage which , as you noted, is needed . Drivers
will break like mad , but no one but the community has all the hardware
for the drivers.
