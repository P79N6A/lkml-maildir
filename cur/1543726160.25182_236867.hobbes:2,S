And it is only reading to preload the dumper in memory.  This happens
before the system crashes.
All that happens at crash dump time is we hand off control to the dumper.
kexec is just the mechanism to switch from the kernel to the dumper.
It is attractive to make the dumper based on the current linux kernel
but that is by no means a requirement.
