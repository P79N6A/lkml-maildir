Separate modules would mean the user have to know which protocol to
choose each time. And this make little sense.
You really want to auto-negotiate which protocol to use, because you
could have at the same time a connection to a Vista/Longhorn (SMB2)
machine and one to a Windows 2000 server (plain SMB) in the same domain
using the same credentials.
To me it make no sense to separate them out, unless one can load the
other on demand when needed and be able to pass all relevant data and
the network connection to the other.
Simo.
