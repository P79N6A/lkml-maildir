it's very likely not the simple jack_test client. I've attached the
trace in question. Here are the tasks that were running:
 gkrellm
   IRQ 0
  IRQ 14
   IRQ 5
   jackd
 kblockd
  korgac
ksoftirq
qjackctl
  qsynth
       X
    xmms
the trace doesnt show what task jackd was waiting on, and it would be
hard to establish it, the tracepoint would have to 'discover' all other
holders of the pipe fd, which is quite complex.

which jackd version is this? I saw similar small spurious xruns with
99.0, those went away in recent CVS versions.
