Hi, Stefan.
Sorry for the late reply, but I am about to be submitted to a surgery and
had to make some health tests, which prevented me from trying to debug
things regarding this problem.

Ok, I see.

Well, it surely looked like an update, since the revision number of the svn
repo was higher than what is in the kernel right now. But that's from the
standpoint from a luser (me).

With 2.6.13-rc1, I just need the sbp2.[ch] files patched from trunk and
everything works fine (that is, BTW, what I am using right now).
But with the recently released 2.6.13-rc1-mm1, patching the sbp2.[ch] files
isn't sufficient anymore (i.e., I get results similar to what I had when I
first started this thread).
I have not yet had time to pass the disable_irm parameter to a -rc1-mm1
kernel (patched or not), but will do (or anything else, if you guys want me
to) so that we can have Linus's kernel 2.6.13 working as 2.6.12 did (but
with the nice improvements to other subsystems also). :-)
Thank you very much, Rogério.
