Subject: [PATCH 46/56] ocfs2: Explain t_is_new in ocfs2_cp_xattr_cluster().
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

From: Joel Becker <joel.becker@oracle.com>
I was unsure of the JOURNAL_ACCESS parameters in
ocfs2_cp_xattr_cluster().  They're based on the function argument
't_is_new', but I couldn't quite figure out how t_is_new mapped to
allocation.  ocfs2_cp_xattr_cluster() actually overwrites the target,
regardless of t_is_new.
Well, I just figured it out.  So I'm adding a big fat comment for those
who come after me.  ocfs2_divide_xattr_cluster() has the same behavior.
