Let's see if this fixes it.  When a Netware server first comes up, both
IPX and NCP are active, but do return some error codes if the SYS volume
has not been mounted yet if someone attempts to connect to the LOGIN
directory (which is where clients get pointed by default when they first
connect).  It sounds like someone is getting a field with '0' in it in
the request which is causing the NULL deference.  NetWare 5.1 is a
little different, but only because the IPX and NCP modules are not
compiled proper in the NetWare kernel as they are in 4.11, and get
loaded AFTER the volume mounts.  I am wondering if this problem is
confined to 4.X and below.  I would think that 5.1 would not have this
problem since the SYS:LOGIN directory will get mounted before the IPX
and NCP engines load.  Let's see if what you suggest fixes this.
