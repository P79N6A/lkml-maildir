AFAIK, you simply can't... I'm trying to do this for several months and 
no luck. Linux simply caches everything it can in the read-cache. For 
99% of all cases this is very good but, for some situations, this is not 
desireable.
For the write cache, you can minimize memory usage playing with 
/proc/sys/vm (see Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt).
