Which is good, provided that non-mmu work is actively driving some of
the decisions in mainline. Given that I don't follow the non-mmu work
at all, I don't have a feel for whether that is the case, but I could
imagine that it would have some impact that needs to be taken into
account at times. My worry is for spending time and slots on things /
people dealing with classic architectures which are no longer being
manufactured and are only being maintained in catch-up mode.
Cheers,
Jes
