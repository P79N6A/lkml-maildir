The Alpha only has about 43 address bits; is the Alpha not 64-bit?

Yes, exactly. For userspace, this is hidden by the compiler.

At that point I expect a fix for the virtual address space too.
If not, you can extend the hack a bit. Don't use Electric Fence.

The compiler may be able to reduce it a bit. Even if not, I have
yet to see another proposal that gets the job done on ia32.
In other words: I did it! I claim bragging rights to this abomination.
