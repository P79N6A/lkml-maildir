IIRC, alpha, sparc, and parisc also are broken then.

There are two "views" of a PCI resource and the names I've used in
the past are "IO View" and "CPU View". The raw BAR value is the "IO View"
since that's what that devices on that PCI bus need to use for Peer-to-Peer
reads/writes. IIRC, sym2 driver directly reads the BAR for telling the scripts
engine where onboard RAM lives. The "CPU View" is what drivers/user space
needs to use when accessing the device. This is what we should be
exporting to user space and I'm pretty sure that's what X.org/XF86
should be using too. Bjorn, have I got that right?

ISTR Bjorn was looking at this and the VGA routing issues.
