no, this is due to a fairly recent commit, so 2.6.23 should not be 
affected. (We cleaned up sched_rr_interval() in one of the 2.6.24 
scheduler commits.)

this should only affect the v24 CFS version - i've updated the v24 
backport patches. sched_rr_interval() is almost never used, and it's 
basically never used for SCHED_OTHER tasks.
