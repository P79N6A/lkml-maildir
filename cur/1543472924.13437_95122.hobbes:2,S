This is 2.1.132ac2. The 8390 might work now, or it might not work at all.
It has the fix from Linus for the enable_irq bug.

Differences between 2.1.132ac2 and 2.1.132ac1
o	8390 locking rewrite (me)
o	IDE CD update (Jens Axboe)
o	Alpha/PPC compile fixes (Michael Gilbert)
o	QlogicFC update (Chris Loveland)
o	ES1370/71/Sonic Vibes updates (Thomas Sailer)
o	enable/disable_irq fix (Linus)
o	HFS update (Adrian Sun)
o	Clean up of Make config (John Lenton, Me)
	| Note for those who type blindly at speed into make config - the fs 
	| stuff has changed order to be Alphabetical by section
o	Metalab was sunsite.unc.edu, 
	Now its metalab not sunsite.unc.edu
	Been a long time gone sunsite.unc.edu
	Now its a generally bright not a special sun site
	Every file in sunsite.unc.edu
	Lives in metalab not sunsite.unc.edu
	So if you've got a url for sunsite.unc.edu
	It'll be archived for you in metalab
	....
