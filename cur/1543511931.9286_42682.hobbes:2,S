Alan was right and I was wrong.
The referenced problem was 2.0 specific and has been solved in the current
kernels on TCP level.
Alan, I'm sorry for being so stupidly insistent on this issue.
I still believe that IP IDs should be unpredictable.
But I don't have more strong arguments than defragmentation attacks and port
scanning with faked source at this moment.
Best regards
		Andrey
