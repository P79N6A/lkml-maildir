Hi.
I've downloaded the new kernel and tried to compile it. Got a
compilation error:
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux/kernel'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486
-malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686   -c -o
acct.o acct.c
acct.c: In function `sys_acct':
acct.c:197: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
acct.c:203: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
m
checked the file kernel/acct.c out and found the following line:
	filp_close(old_acct);
	filp_close(file);
looked at the file include/linux/fs.h and found:
extern int filp_close(struct file *, fl_owner_t id);
This looks like a bug to me. Anybody got an idea how to fix it? (Or
have I screwed up? :)
