    For some reason I am getting a strange message when I try to build
either -ck1 or 2, another message I tried to send to the list seems to
not have gotten where I intended to, I'm quoting that message here also:

I get the same error, thus far I know that the file in question
(iprio.h) inclues sched.h and that in sched.h SCHED_BATCH and
SCHED_ISO are defined, so why am I getting this error in the said
function, is beyond me.
Any pointers?
