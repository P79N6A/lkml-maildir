Ok, good to know that the kernel was correct, but it might be worthwhile 
trying to debug why grub thinks it should do it's (incorrect) memory map. 
Also, I'd suggest somebody send the grub team a patch to remove the whole 
damn mess, I doubt anybody who installs a new bootloader is interested in 
installing a buggy one.
Pretty much every kernel has done a better job of memory sizing than grub 
seems to do, and I suspect even the "pre-2.4.14" case was just a total bug 
in grub, and nothing else.
