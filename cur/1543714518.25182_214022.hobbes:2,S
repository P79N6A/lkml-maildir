I have 1.5 GB. I tried to disable highmem, now less than 1GB is visible, but 
there is no noticable difference in SATA performance:
siimage:
/dev/hde:
 setting fs readahead to 8129
 setting 32-bit IO_support flag to 1
 setting multcount to 16
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 8128 (on)
 geometry     = 16383/255/63, sectors = 145226112, start = 0
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   1428 MB in  2.00 seconds = 713.75 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  100 MB in  3.03 seconds =  32.99 MB/sec
libata
/dev/sda:
 setting fs readahead to 8192
 readahead    = 8192 (on)
 Timing buffered disk reads:   82 MB in  3.02 seconds =  27.17 MB/sec
