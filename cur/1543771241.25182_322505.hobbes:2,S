Also, I'm telling you as a person that works for a well known RTOS company
that this patch is very very close to achieving the hard determinism goals
outlined. It has good latency and good overall kernel performancei and it's
much closer to your notion of "ruby" hard RT that you might realize. What's
needed to be done is largely driver mop up and nothing more that I can tell.
There hasn't been any major driver changes submitted recently with this
patch so the code base is pretty stable at the moment.
