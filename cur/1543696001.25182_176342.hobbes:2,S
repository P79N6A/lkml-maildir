OK.  I think.  Net driver suspend handlers in general seem a bit racy wrt
interrupt activity as well as SMP.  Maybe I'm missing something.

Wouldn't hurt, thanks.  It's one way to wake Jeff up ;)
8139too just does netif_device_detach(), whereas your sis900 patch does
netif_stop_queue() and then netif_device_detach().
I don't know which is right, really.  8139too will end up with a
non-stopped queue if __LINK_STATE_PRESENT is clear.  The sis900 approach is
certainly safe enough, but it'd be nice to know what netif_device_detach()
is trying to do there.
