That would be great. I think maybe I should start by ripping out the
discontigmem stuff altogether, since there are no boards available
that requires it. But I can perhaps test sparsemem on a prototype
board.

Thanks. There are patches for binutils and gcc available from avr32linux.org:
http://avr32linux.org/twiki/pub/Main/GccPatches/gcc-4.0.2-avr32.patch
http://avr32linux.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/BinutilsPatches
For binutils you should probably grab the pre-patched source tarball
unless you want to mess around with autoconf. I tried to make a patch
after regenerating all the makefiles, but the patch ended up being 5x
the size of the original one...

The pagetable code in ioremap.c is indeed copied verbatim from another
architecture (I think it was MIPS.) I'll look at all the
implementations of remap_area_pages() and see if it's possible to
consolidate them when I get back to work in a bit less than two weeks.
I won't be submitting any patches until then, but your mail will wait
for me in my inbox so I won't forget about it. Thanks for taking the
time to review this.
