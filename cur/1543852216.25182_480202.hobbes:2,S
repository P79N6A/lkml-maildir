technically the link is already up if the cable is inserted and connected. doing an 
`ifconfig up` doesn't change that. If the link is down then this powers up the PHY so we 
can read the link status.

no, not that I know of.

I bet that all drivers work fine if you `ifconfig up` them. What happens if other NIC 
drivers implement similar powersaving methods and start working the same?
