Note, even increasing the audio buffer of the emulation app to its maximum does not help. Of note, the machine I ran this emulator on had a low load.

Must be an application bug, otherwise more apps would be affected.
The best solution is to use a separate high priority thread for anything
with a real time constraint, like audio playback or capture.
