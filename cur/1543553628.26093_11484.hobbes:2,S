Subject: [PATCH] document ECN in 2.4 Configure.help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/11/6/2

As the dates below show, I've actually been sitting on this patch for about
a week, but I just now got a chance to post it. I haven't had time to
fully, absolutely, completely grok what ECN is, so it's possible that this
help text is incorrect. If so, I'd like to hear about it.
This patch is against test10pre7 but applies cleanly to test10 final as
well.

+TCP Explicit Congestion Notification support
+CONFIG_INET_ECN
+  Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows routers to notify
+  clients about network congestion, resulting in fewer dropped packets
+  and increased network performance. This option adds ECN support to the
+  Linux kernel, as well as a sysctl (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn) which
+  allows ECN support to be disabled at runtime.
+
+  Note that, on the Internet, there are many broken firewalls which
+  refuse connections from ECN-enabled machines, and it may be a while
+  before these firewalls are fixed. Until then, to access a site behind
+  such a firewall (some of which are major sites, at the time of this
+  writing) you will have to disable this option, either by saying N now
+  or by using the sysctl.
+
+  If in doubt, say N.
