Our threading indexer routinely crashes our Adaptec 2400A. How can I

Thanks, I believe this confirms my understanding at least regarding the
`leak'. I will try to `make it better' in the future.
The panic you forwarded is a source of consternation. It occurs in the
scsi_done command which takes it out of the driver making it difficult of
debug (remote as we are).
Being able to duplicate this problem locally becomes necessary. If you can
provide to me a simplified set of tools and description on how to duplicate
this, I will get this sent off to our software test team to bash on.
Sincerely -- Mark Salyzyn
