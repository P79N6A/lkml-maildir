Having them compatible acroess an insane range of kernels
is a nice but futile exercise.
Perhaps this partly explains why:
1. util-linux doesn't cover half of the system utilities needed on
    a sanely actual Linux system.
2. The Linux vendors have to apply insane number of patches to it
    util it's moderately usable.

No I don't see that point. Data which has to be persistant across
reboots is simple data which has to reside on disk. That's the
way it is in UNIX (PalmOS to name an example).
And after all it's rather trivial to iterate *all* disks present at boot
by hand and just going through /dev/sdaxxx chains. SCSI allocates
them consecutively anyway and there are typically not many ATA diskst around
there.
After all kudzu is performing nearly the whole job for anything else
except disks anyway for example.
