Hey,
Sorry to bother you, but I noticed a message of yours on the internet which 
said, to enable AMD 761 support in Linux you should set 
"agp_try_unsupported=3D1" option... but where?
There's no option for that in the kernel config, so I'm assuming it's in a 
header file somewhere, or something.  I've got AGP support compiled directly 
in the kernel, so I can't specify it as a module parameter... and I'd like to 
keep it right in the kernel if possible.
Any help would be _greatly_ appreciated :)
Thanks,
Jeff
