Another data point for the troubleshooters...  With 2.3.4[1-2], various
network applications are slow to fire up, taking as long as a minute.
On my machine, this has affected at least "syslogd" and "sshd".
Incoming ssh connections work fine with 2.3.40, but take about a minute
to become established with 2.3.42.
