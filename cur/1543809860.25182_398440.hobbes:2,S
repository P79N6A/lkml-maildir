Subject: [PATCHSET] Time: Generic Timeofday Subsystem (v B19)

All,
	First, my apologies, I've been out of it with a cold this week, so this
release i isn't quite where I'd like it to be. However, I wanted  to get
this out so the new changes can be reviewed. With this release I've
diverged a bit from the patches in -mm, but I plan to send the changes
to Andrew and sync back up next week. The biggest change is the
experimental ntp-error-fix patch which implements a suggestion from
Roman for more precise NTP error accounting.
This patchset provides a generic timekeeping subsystem that is
independent of the timer interrupt. This allows for robust and correct
behavior in cases of late or lost ticks, avoids interpolation errors,
reduces duplication in arch specific code, and allows or assists future
changes such as high-res timers, dynamic ticks, or realtime preemption.
Additionally, it provides finer nanosecond resolution values to the
clock_gettime functions.
The patch set provides the minimal NTP changes, the clocksource
abstraction, the core timekeeping code as well as the code to convert
i386. It also includes patches that convert powerpc and x86-64, but for
now I'm only focusing on getting the i386 bits merged.
Changes since the B18 release:
o New experimental ntp-error-accounting patch (suggested by Roman)
o Merged Adrian Bunk's small fixes
o Dropped nsec_t typedef (as suggested by Roman)
o Dropped the pmtmr cleanups (avoids conflicting w/ x86-64)
o Synced w/ changes from -mm
Outstanding issues:
o No reported problem from testing in -mm
Still on my TODO list:
o Sync back to -mm
o Possible rebasing ontop of Roman's NTP changes
o More cleanups for the NTP error accounting patch
o Add clocksource.resolution info for hrtimer
o Squish any bugs that pop up from testing
o Clean and split up x86-64 and powerpc patches
o ppc, s390, arm, ia64, alpha, sparc, sparc64, etc work
The patchset applies against the current 2.6.16-rc4-git.
