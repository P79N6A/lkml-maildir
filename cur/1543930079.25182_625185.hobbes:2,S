Missing space after closing parenthesis. Also, I don't quite see what
is supposed to make compatibility with the legacy drivers easier, nor
how, not why it matters in the first place.

This is no longer a boolean value, is that OK? I guess that it doesn't
matter but maybe it should be documented (what GPIO drivers are allowed
to return in these callback functions.)

Shouldn't this be degraded to dev_warn? The probe still succeeds. Or
keep dev_err but make the probe fail (in which case you'll probably
want to swap this block of code with the dev_info above.)
