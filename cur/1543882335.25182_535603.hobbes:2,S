I think we need this.  Apparently, some device drivers need as much as 30 meg
of RAM at later stages (I don't know why and what for).

Please note that some drivers are compiled as modules and they may deal with
uninitialized hardware (or worse, with the hardware initialized by the BIOS in
a crazy way) after restart_snapshot().  It may be better for them to actually
quiesce the devices here too to avoid problems after restart_snapshot() .

Yes, and usually the majority of modules is not loaded at that time.

I think devices _should_ be resetted in restart_snapshot(), unless it's
possible to check if they have already been initialized by the "old" kernel -
but this information would have to be available from the device itself.

What unfreeze() would be needed for in that case?

We need to free as much memory as we'll need for the image creation at this
point.

You've added freeze() here, but it's not on your list above?

I think it's not necessary.

Agreed.

Agreed again.
Moreover, in the s2ram case there are no problems with device drivers compiled
as modules.
