The recommended encoding algorithm forbids anything but the shortest
sequence, yes, but what will the majority of decoders do?  I suspect
that at least some will follow the usual networking rule of be liberal
in what you accept, which for filenames may well cause all sorts of
security holes.

Well, as long as every userspace implementation gets it correct, we'll
be OK.  Personally, I doubt they all will, especially those that
convert from legacy encodings to Unicode, although quite possibly the
above scenario with combining characters is not likely to happen for
filenames.  Or is it?  What about copying a file from a filesystem
with a UTF-8 encoding to a filesystem with a legacy encoding, and then
back again?
However, I am less concerned about this second scenario than the first.
John.
