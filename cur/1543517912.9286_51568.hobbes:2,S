Is that 2.2.12-20 the distribution kernel,?? or one you have compiles yourself.?
Providing that /mnt/vfat exsists, then there is no reason why this should not
work with the distribution kernel 2.2.12-20 from Redhat.
Obviously something was not installed properly, make sure
/lib/modules/2.2.12-20/fs has;
nls_iso8859-1.o
nls_cp437.o
vfat.o
fat.o
If there not there then you did not include the modules, but having said that
they should be instaled automaticly.
On  full install it all works i can speak from experiance, i cant speak about
a work station, however i see no reason for it not to work.
Try the follwoing.
modprobe nls_iso8859-1
modprobe nls_cp437 
modprobe vfat
modprobe fat
Then;
mount  -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt/vfat
If that works then /sbin/kerneld is not running.
Possably an entry in /etc/fstab as
/dev/hda1  /windows  vfat  noauto 1 0
Will help you, then all you need to do is;
mount /windows
Of course the directory windows must exsist.
On a side note, all the mentioned modules are there on a standard Redhat-6.1
distribution.
