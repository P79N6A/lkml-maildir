Surely that is an admin problem to make sure that /mount
exists on the root fs. When your messing with something as
fundamental as init you should be able to insist on this.
It is easy to do a mount() system call, the rootfs can be ro.

Would the user not need root privilegdes to mess with /proc?
Is there any good reason why init should not be executable
by root only?
