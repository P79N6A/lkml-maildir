kbuild does not know anything about ASFLAGS.
In the whole kernel tree I only see frv assign them but the
value is never used.
LDFLAGS has not been changed - it was not such an easy cut.
And we anyway use the linker in much more ways so when to
use it and when not...

I would prefer that any day as replacement for the symlinks.
But as everyone else seems so happy with the symlinks do whatever you prefer.

It will wait until we save ARCH so we can detect
ARCH changes.

For the Image target it is Image without $(boot)/ but that target
was never supported anyway.

It just seemed stupid that someone having copyright on a file
where the person only had contributed the copyright linei (for said file).
