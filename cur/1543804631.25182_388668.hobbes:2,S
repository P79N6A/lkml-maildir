So what you're basically saying is that we should make zero changes
to the kernel, because any change (even a minor bug fix) may cause
you to need to do some work.  Should we just increment the version
number every 3 months then?
Maybe we could do this _if_ folk would stop working on the kernel,
wanting it to run on their latest creations.
The fact is that in the ARM world, everyone wants a stable kernel
which has support for all the features in the SoC de jour that
they're using.  That previous sentence is self-contradictory - it's
an impossible scenario.  You can't have a kernel which supports the
latest features without progressive and continuous change.
