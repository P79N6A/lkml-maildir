That's precisely a subscribers-only list. At least as per MAINTAINER's

mentioned in MAINTAINERS that _drops_ messages posted to it entirely!

Exactly a similar message greets those who post to linux-arm-kernel@
and it (and other such lists) is referred to everywhere in that file
as (subscribers-only), for example. The patch is correct, IMO.
