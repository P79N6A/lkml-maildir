That's a very different semantic from what MacOS does, and looks like a  
pretty poor match for the data structures involved.
To start with, the creator is an attribute much like the user and group  
under Linux, and is *not* implemented via resource forks. So it really  
doesn't belong here, it belongs in a fs-specific stat() extension  
(possibly an ioctl).
Then, the structure is either low-level
        open("file/resourcefork", O_RDONLY)
- which you *can* do on MacOS (just with a different function instead of a  
different name) - or for individual resources, it's more like
        open("file/ICON/-16383", O_RDONLY)
Yes, there's a hierarchy involved.
