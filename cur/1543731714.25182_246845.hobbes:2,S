The numbers looks so bad that for many cases it's going to be a
significant win if we simply call nproc_send_note in said paths. But
I'll admit that I've been entertaining thoughts about a global queue
or something to send notifications in batches.

A more likely guarantee is that a process that can't keep up with
differential updates won't be able to process the whole list, either.
Well, unless the system is loaded with tons of short-lived processes
that wouldn't even make the full process list by the time it's pulled.
But in such a case, a complete list of task won't do you much good,
either, because by the time you are ready to query the kernel for
details the tasks are gone.

Point. Task discovery is not an exact science anyway, though.
I'd still expect differential notification to be useful in most
non-pathological cases, but I concede it's nowhere as clear-cut as
nproc per se is.

While I'm not sure I understand how that partial rescan (or its limits)
would be defined, I agree with the general idea. There is indeed plenty
of room for improvement in a smart user space. For instance, most apps
show only the top n processes. So if an app shows the top 20 memory
users, it could use nproc to get a complete list of pid+vmrss, and then
request all the expensive fields only for the top 20 in that list.

Uhm... Optimized string parsing would require updated user space
anyway. OTOH, I can buy the legacy kernel argument, so if you want to
rewrite the user space tools, go wild :-). You may find that there are
issues more serious than string parsing:
$ ps --version
procps version 3.2.3
$ ps -o pid
  PID
 2089
 2139
$ strace ps -o pid 2>&1|grep 'open("/proc/'|wc -l
325

Makes sense. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't misleading you.
