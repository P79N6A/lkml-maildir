Stays consistent, 60+ day uptime.

You might have to plead insanity ;)

I'm running 2.4.18-pre7-ac1, 2.4.19-pre8-ac(can't recall), all the boxes 
transfer 2G+ of data a day (home network). IIRC i've been using those 
cards since 2.4.2ish almost without skipping any version updates.
Cards are 3c905B on i440BX, SIS5595 and ServerWorks CNB20LE
I hope this information is of some use to you.
