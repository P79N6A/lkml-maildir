An executive of another affiliated company said that he felt the passion
of IBM, which is determined to invest US$1 billion, this year alone, in
Linux. "IBM's passion really dragged us into this movement," he added.

shall be no free ride on Linux to be enhanced by IBM investing a huge
amount of money.'
