Yes, we'll have several disjoint per-node cpu spans for a large system, but 
nearby nodes *will* overlap with more distant nodes than any given node, so I 
think we're covered, unless I'm misunderstanding something.

Right.  And ultimately, I think we'll want the hierarchy I mentioned in the 
comments, that'll cover us a little better I think.
