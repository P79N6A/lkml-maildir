   Attached is an untested patch for LiS. 
The sparc64 changes are absolutely wrong, the syscalls take pointers
and thus must go through a 32-bit ABI to 64-bit ABI syscall
translation routine.
This is another reason I don't want people to be able to register
system calls dynamically, it bypasses being able to verify this for
ppc64, mips64, sparc64, x86_64 x86, and ia64 x86.
