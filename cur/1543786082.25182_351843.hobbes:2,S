This is also the reason for the 'srcversion' field available in
modinfo.  This is a CRC across the source code for a given module (not
counting #include<*>, but counting #include "*").  The version field
may not change, but if anything really cares about a particular source
code copy, and that it hasn't been patched, but the version field not
updated, they can see that.
Thanks to Rusty for implementing this.
Thanks,
Matt
