I can't get 2.6.21-rc7-CFS-v4 to boot. Immediately after selecting
this kernel I see a very fast scrolling (loop?) sequence of addrs
which I don't know how to stop to write them down. They don't appear
in any kernel log either. However I see two Tux at the top of the
screen.
I'm using the very same .config I also use with 2.6.21-rc7-sd0.x
What could be wrong and how could I track that down ?
FWIW this also happened with 2.6.21-rc7-CFS-v3 and thus for
2.6.21-rc7-CFS-v4 I did a pristine extract of 2.6.20.tar.bz2 and
applied all patches freshly.
System is a Dell XPS M1710, Intel Core2 T7600 2.33, 4GB
Best,
Michael
