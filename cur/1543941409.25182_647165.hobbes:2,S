Sorry, I'm going to drop this.  And I guess the whole series.
On my 7000th fix-it-for-git-x86-changes I ended up with this:
static inline struct page *pmd_pgtable(pmd_t *pmd)
{
	return pmd_page(pmd);
}
expanding to this:
static inline __attribute__((always_inline)) struct page *pmd_pgtable(pmd_t *pmd)
{
	return ((mem_map + ((((native_pgd_val(((pmd).pud).pgd))) >> 12) - (0UL))));
}
and producing this:
In file included from include/asm/pgalloc.h:2,
                 from include/asm/mmu_context_32.h:6,
                 from include/asm/mmu_context.h:2,
                 from arch/x86/kernel/ldt.c:20:
include/asm/pgalloc_32.h: In function 'pmd_pgtable':
include/asm/pgalloc_32.h:37: error: request for member 'pud' in something not a structure or union
it was a revolting experience picking through the mess we've made, trying
to work out when we're using ptes/pmds/puds/pgds versus when we're using
*pointers* to those things.  The obsessional use type-free macros, the
liberal avoidance of comments and the general spaghettiness of it all makes
this far harder than it should be.
The reason why I chose to drop the patch rather than keep poking away at it
was:

This is just making a bad situation worse.  Please only use macros as a
last resort.  Please prefer to code in typesafe, self-documenting C.
