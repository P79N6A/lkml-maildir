	Thank you, Linus, for making my point to Greg more clearly
than I did.  Saying that the pwc decompressor hooks were removed "as
they are a GPL violation" is a difficult statement to support, and
brings up unresolved legal issues -- exactly what I tried to say.  I'm
pleased you've clarified this issue for Greg and the rest of us.
	In concordance with Linus' policy statement above, Greg, could
you change your patch attribution to say something like "per kernel
policy", please?  If for no other reason than to reduce dissention
among future lkml archive delvers about why the pwc removal took
place?  :-)

[My apologies to anyone who received this message in duplicate.  I
sent a shorter version of it last night, but as I never received it
back from vger and it doesn't appear in the www.uwsg.iu.edu archive,
I assume it was eaten somewhere along the way.]
