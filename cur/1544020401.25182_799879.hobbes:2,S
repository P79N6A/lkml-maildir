I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but let me try and
explain more clearly.
Without Nick's patch you'd have to hit the following path:
  mutex_lock()  <--- inotify_mutex
  inotify_inode_is_dead()
  dentry_iput()
  d_kill()
  __shrink_dcache_sb()
  shrink_dcache_memory()
  shrink_slab()
  try_to_free_page() <-- direct reclaim
  alloc_pages()
  alloc_slab_page()
  allocate_slab()
  new_slab()
  __slab_alloc()
  kmem_cache_alloc()
  idr_pre_get()
  inotify_handle_get_wd()
  inotify_add_watch() <-- inotify_mutex
  sys_inotify_add_watch()
  syscall_call
before the recursive check would actually produce a warning.
This path is very unlikely, as it would have to enter direct reclaim
from exactly the right allocation.
With Nick's patch, we get notified about this possibility without ever
having had to actually hit this.
