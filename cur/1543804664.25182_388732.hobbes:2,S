It seems like IRQ routing problem.  The driver never receives the
completion interrupts.  When it times out, it finds out that the command
is actually complete, so the slow completion messages.  Turning off ACPI
seems to be a popular solution.

Oh well, it would be much easier/better to just fix the original problem.
