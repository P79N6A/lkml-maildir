You should read this thread:
http://unix.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/FreeBSD/arch/2005-02/0039.html
The shebang processing needs to somehow magically split up the first
line into the file into "some number of arguments for the interpreter"
"some number of arguments for the script being run", and "the script
being run."
The first two are the big difficulty, how should the kernel know which
arguments are meant for the interpreter and which are meant for the
script?
In the article I referenced, current Linux behavior seems to conform
to at least the majority of other OSes do, and I believe freeBSD
actually moved from trying to split the arguments up into something
similar (though I couldn't swear to it).
