Thinking about it, this does the wrong thing for _another_ reason.
Basically, if you compile radeonfb as a module, and say "Y" to RADEON_I2C, 
then that should _not_ force I2C to be built-in to the kernel, but that 
is in fact exactly what this would force.
Damn. I think your first patch was "more correct", but there's no question
that it was also pretty ugly and had exactly the same problem wrt
I2C_ALGOBIT, methinks.
What we actually want to say is something like "select I2C=FB_RADEON",
which makes the minimal dependency of I2C be the same value as FB_RADEON
(which is a tristate) rather than FB_RADEON_I2C (boolean).
Roman, maybe you can help with something that actually gets this right?
