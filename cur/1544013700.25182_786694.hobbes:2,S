Unfortunately, as has been pointed out, timezones are completely
unrelated to leap seconds.
NB. Leap seconds, positive or negative, potentially occur every six
months (June 30 or Dec 31), but since their introduction this
frequency has happened only once (in 1972); historically they have
been inserted on average every 1.5 years, but there have been only two
since 2000.
