"totally unstable" being defined as:  My computers don't crash, and my 
100%-mainline test kernels pass various Cerberus/LTP/crashme runs.
Of course, I am not totally focused on multi-million-dollar computers, 
so maybe my perspective is skewed...  ;-)

It's the 2.4 tree that's missing all the vendor junk unacceptable for 
mainline.

Fixes should be applied to 2.4-mainline, certainly.  Anything else just 
wastes developer brain cycles and slows the move to 2.6.
