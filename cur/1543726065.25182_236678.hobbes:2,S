Although I believe you, the timer problem exists only when boot
reports the TSC skew.

Drift doesn't seem to be a problem; if the system boots without the
'skew' message, I have no timer difficulties even if the box is up for
months.  If the system boots with a skew message, not a single
timer-based op on the machine seems to work ever; I can't watch
movies, play games or anything.  I'll get a few frames, a freeze for
several seconds, a few seconds of frames, freeze for several seconds,
a frame or two, more freeze, etc...  This appears to be related to
processor affinity (when the process gets bounced to the other CPU,
the timers appear to just freeze for a while or stop entirely).

I will try that and report back.

I do run ntpd. My problem and concern is primarily with sub-second
timers having a granularity of several seconds.

The bug is all or nothing.  Without the bootup skew report, the
machine runs flawlessly indefinitely.
