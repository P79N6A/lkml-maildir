You used the stdio routine fread - which buffers in user space.  It
does a single read, and then feeds you the characters as you ask for
them, out of its stdio buffer.
Try the following program, which doesn't buffer:
main()
{
    char c;
    int fd = open("/proc/uptime", 0);
    while (read(fd, &c, 1) == 1) {
        write(1, &c, 1);
        sleep(1);
    }
}
