I thought that the latest stable release was 2.6.11.5.
However, what I really want to do is ask what patches should be
made against.  I suggested on linux-scsi a day or 2 ago that
they should be made against the latest linus-bk (or snapshot)
unless the patch only applies to -mm, then they should obviously
be made against -mm.  2.6.11 plain is relatively aged IMO also....
