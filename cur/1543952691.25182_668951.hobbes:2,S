  a quick run of one of my scanning scripts shows the following header
files under include/linux that no one appears to be including,
although some of them are being exported to userspace:
  fd1772.h
  if_wanpipe.h
  can/error.h
  mtd/jedec.h
  hdsmart.h
  dvb/version.h   [i think this one's all right]
anyone have any hard opinions on any of the above?
