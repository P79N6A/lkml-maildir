Well, there's user-space and user-space. A part of the user space is
kernel/system oriented, like fsck.* or util-linux (mount, chattr!)
configuration tools or user-space parts of drivers, and there's a part
of user-space that is unrelated.
If the kernel related stuff (which usually is in /sbin) needs to be
updated, that's fine even for a "stable" kernel. If the new
reiserfs-progs fix a problem of an older version, then by all means go
fix and update Documentation/Changes. There could be a new "recommended"
column though which lists non-critical version updates.
