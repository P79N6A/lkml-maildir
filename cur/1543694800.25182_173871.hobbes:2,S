Actually, that 'printk' is useful.  As i understand it, the only way software
suspend is going to work is that if the same video mode is used on resume as
on booting.  If one uses "vga=ask", then one can 'dmesg | grep' to generate
a proper string for 'lilo -R' (which i already do to make sure the correct
kernel gets resumed during testing).  If i'm mistaken about needing to set
VGA mode identically on resume, then i have no objection to removing the
printk.
I'm also fine with flushing it that if there's another reasonably convenient
way of obtaining the same information.
