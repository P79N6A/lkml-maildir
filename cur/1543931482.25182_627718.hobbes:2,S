Ah, now I see.  I forgot that not every device has a 1:1::napi:netdev
relationship.
Could we make an optional *dev_state field in the napi structure.
It would be initialized to __LINK_STATE_START.  Devices which have
a 1:1 NAPI:netdevice relationship would set it to &netdev->state.
The generic code would then do a test_bit(__LINK_STATE_START, 
napi->dev_state), and 1:1 drivers could remove this check.
M:N drivers would pay for a useless (to them) test_bit, and would
have to provide their own netif_running check to get termination
under heavy load.
Just an idea, perhaps there is a better way which is less hacky.
Or perhaps we should just leave things as is.
