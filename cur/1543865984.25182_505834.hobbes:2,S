No. We are not fiddling with the IRQ subsystem statistics. IRQ subsystem
is unrelated to timers. And we do switch away from PIT if we have an
local apic timer, so the output of /proc/interrupt is just a mirror of
the real system and not some made up thing, which will make it harder to
debug real problems.

I did not hear a complaint of anyone except you. I doubt that there will
be a big confusion as long as the kernel does work as expected.
