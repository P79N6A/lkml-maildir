The only remaining issue is whether Nick & Jiri have enough
original contributions to the code to be added to the Copyright.
I believe this needs to be resolved between Reyk and Nick and Jiri.

dismissing this issue, and thus stalling its resolution by the
developers.
The rest is, as you say, history.
