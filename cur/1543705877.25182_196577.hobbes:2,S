Possibly the read-ahead size isn't getting set correctly.
What chunksize are you using on the raid0?
Are you free to rebuild the raid0 array?
If so, please rebuild it with a chunksize that is 2 or 4 times the
size of a raid5 stripe (i.e. raid5-chunksize * (raid5-drives - 1) ).
If not, can you change:
		if (mddev->queue->backing_dev_info.ra_pages < stripe)
			mddev->queue->backing_dev_info.ra_pages = stripe;
at about line 327 of drives/md/raid1.c to something like:
		mddev->queue->backing_dev_info.ra_pages = stripe * 32;
or whatever is needed to make ra_pages big enough to gold a couple of
raid5 stripes.
Thanks,
