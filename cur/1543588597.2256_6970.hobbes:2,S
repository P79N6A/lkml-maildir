Did you try nesting more than one "su -"? The first one after a boot works
for me - every other one fails.
I'm on RH71 - this may be specific to this release. It's also
kernel-dependent, I can reboot with ac5 and the problem does not happen.
The kernel is compiled with the same compiler as yours.
My libc is 2.2.2 while yours is 2.1.3 - this may be the difference.
