Or a trap. I'm not about to go anywhere near this and won't even look at
the licience but I bet the M$ argument will go something like:
   You've looked at the code.
   You now know things that are propriatary to M$.
   You are not allowed to apply it to anything outside M$.
   Stop working on those free sources the forbidden knowledge might leak.
   You have me assimilated.
