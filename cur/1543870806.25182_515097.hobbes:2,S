   It is NOT a Kconfig error. The problem is that for many fbdev drivers 
the backlight code is broken. For some magic reason it only works on 
pmacs. Most likely because the firmware properly sets up the backlight. 
Plus we have the conflict with acpi backlight. 
   Think about it. Enabling the backlight code breaks the backlight. 
Without the backlight driver the default behaviour of the backlight works.
Who sets up the default behavior? I don't have a LCD panel with a 
backlight othewise I would track the problem down.
