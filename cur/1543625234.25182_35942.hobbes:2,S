We're noticing weirdness here also.
Certain apps are SEGFAULTing. Some apps much
more than others. An important point is that
the apps SEGFAULTed in the exact same place
each time. Doing a trace of the core didn't
show anything weird being executed, it just
SEGFAULTed. Does this suggest a cache issue?
A power cycle changed things (made the faults
more/less frequent). The particular app we were
having trouble with was snmpd (net-snmp). Also
much less frequent was vim and bash. When these
crashed, it was also in the same place. An
important note is that snmpd would crash in
exactly the same place across power cycles.
Recompiling a later version of snmpd "fixed"
the problem. I.E. SEGFAULTs are now very infrequent.
We saved the particular snmpd binary that was
causing trouble, for testing.
We tested with Samuel II & Ezra & Celeron CPUs on
both Advantech PCM9576 & Ibase M700 motherboards.
Celeron was OK, Samuel II was OK, ezra caused segfaults.
We also passed memtest86 (RAM is also ECC) and
multiple kernel compiles worked OK also.
Kernel 2.4.16
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-98)
glibc 2.2.4
