The error is basically telling you that ReiserFS filehandles are being
reused by the server. Doesn't Reiser provide a generation count to
guard against this sort of thing?
My 'fix' just solves the immediate problem of the wrong file mode. It
does not solve the problems of data corruption that can occur when the
client is incapable of distinguishing the 'old' and 'new' files that
share the same filehandle.
Cheers,
