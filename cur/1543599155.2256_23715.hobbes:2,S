Congratulations on showing evidence that preemption can improve performance 
under some loads, especially the all-important kernel compile.  Don't be too 
worried about the dbench 1 results, dbench can vary by a factor of 2 
depending on the alignment of the planets (ask Tridge).  Try something more 
stable like bonnie.
The theory goes that preemption improves performance by cutting down the time 
between IO completion and user task resume, with only a small cost in extra 
locking.  It would be nice to see profiling statistics to support this idea.
