That name seems a bit generic for either driver to use!
Except I don't understand why <asm/mach/flash.h> is used there
instead of the more current <linux/mtd/physmap.h> ... certainly
mainstone's current code doesn't need more than physmap.  After
all, the reason for the physmap updates was to help move away
from the platform-specific drivers (like those ARM ones).
And for mainstone, switching looks trivial.  Not to mention
overdue, since the "pxa2xx-flash" driver which would use the
old ARM-specific "flash_platform_data" isn't available in the
kernel.org tree ... so arch/arm/mach-pxa/mainstone.c seems to
be buggy in even using that struct.

Not "all" of them ... and in any case, as I said, I thought
the idea was to start getting rid of all those platform specific
mapping drivers.
In your case, it seems like fixing mainstone.c should come
first; and that would eliminate the problem you're seeing.
As folk have noted, the PXA code hasn't been well maintained;
this would seem to be a symptom of that.
But otherwise, if that ARM-specific stuff should still be
used ... maybe.  You omitted the header file change, as well
as some of its other users.  (A surprising number of Blackfin
boards use m25p80 with platform data to specify partitions.)
A shorter name, maybe "spi_flash_data", would be better too.

I think that'd be for the MTD and platform maintainers to handle.

I'd guess this is just a bug in your spi controller driver or in
its configuration.  It looks like you're using a 32 bits_per_word
setting -- with an effective cpu_to_be32() in the I/O path, wrong
since the data is *already* in the right byte order -- instead of
the 8 bits specified by the driver (no byte order changes).
