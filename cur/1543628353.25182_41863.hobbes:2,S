Hi Thomas,

Any special reason you're trying to do build your network replicated disk using nbd+raid1? I've found the drbd driver (
http://www.linbit.com/en/drbd
) quite useful for exactly this kind of setup. I think the standard raid1 driver is a poor choice in this setup becaus you can't tell it that there's a fairly severe performance penalty for access to one of the devices, so it sohould always read from the local device and just send updates to the remote one. drbd does just that.
Bye, Martin
