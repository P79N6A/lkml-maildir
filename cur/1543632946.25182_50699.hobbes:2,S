Our scheduler *was* a long set of conditionals.  However, from the
stock BSD scheduler through the contorted thing that it became, we
saw something like 30-50% increases in some workloads.  I think
the motivator was actually not Oracle originally but something like
SAP.  Specific numbers are hard to extract now since we did so many
SMP & NUMA changes over the years, but I think I remember a slide
showing over 30% increase in SAP for this one additional feature.
I don't know that I ever saw specific Oracle or Oracle Apps numbers
for this although it was viewed as a "large" benefit, especially
in NUMA machines, but even on SMP machines.
