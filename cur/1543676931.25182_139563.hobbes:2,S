Subject: Patch to scsi_scan.c to look for LUNs on XYRATEX RAID subsystems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/11/75

To all:
This contains a patch that must be made to the scsi_scan.c file which
instructs the O/S to scan
for LUNS on XYRATEX family RAID subsystems.
I created the patch against the 2.4.20 kernel, but all things considered, I
would like to get this single
line of new text added to all 2.4 kernels, and all future kernels.
Note that I only tested against the "RS" string. This is by design, as we
have 12 different productID strings
depending on the RAID engine and enclosure model. Just testing against RS
will work for us as well as save
valuable CPU cycles and kernel space for all.
Any questions, comments, concerns should be addressed to me,
david_lethe@us.xyratex.com
or david@santools.com

P.S. Acknowledgement that this have been incorporated will be appreciated.
