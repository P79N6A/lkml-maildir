Can't comment this patch, but if we can get rid of the work_struct - good!

May I ask you to redo this patch on top of
	[PATCH 1/3] net/bridge/br_if.c: don't use _WORK_NAR
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=117183517612775
?
We are removing the _NAR stuff, it would be nice to do this in a separate
patch.
Thanks!
Oleg.
