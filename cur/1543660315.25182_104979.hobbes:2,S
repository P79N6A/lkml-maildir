You run out of assigned major/minor numbers. There is a sick hack that
steals other device idents but thats not usable in a production environment.
32bit dev_t IMHO is essential to 2.6. Essential enough that if its not in
the base 2.6 all the vendors have to get together and issue a Linus 
incompatible but common 32bit dev_t interface.
