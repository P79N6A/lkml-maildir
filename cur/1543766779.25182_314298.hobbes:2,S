Basically , there is a race condition in sys_timer_delete() and
posix_timer_event() .
>From sys_timer_delete() :
   /*
	 * This keeps any tasks waiting on the spin lock from thinking
	 * they got something (see the lock code above).
	 */
	if (timer->it_process) {
		if (timer->it_sigev_notify ==
(SIGEV_SIGNAL|SIGEV_THREAD_ID))
			put_task_struct(timer->it_process);
		timer->it_process = NULL;
	}
	unlock_timer(timer, flags);
	/* Preemption happens here. */
	release_posix_timer(timer, IT_ID_SET);
So when the timer is getting triggered , right before it takes the timer
lock, preemption happens. You finish the code above. Then your preempted
again right after unlock timer, shown above.
At this point, your triggering a timer that is half deleted, in posix_timer_fn() .
timer->it_process = NULL , so when you try to send the signal to the
timer owner you crash with an OOPS , cause the timer owner was just set
to NULL.
George, at least CC me, after all I found/documented this bug ..
Preliminary fix included ..
