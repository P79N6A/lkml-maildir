Tried those already on both 2.4.21/22 and 2.6.0-test1,2,3.
While the 2.4 driver compiles and works fine the 2.5 sources does not
play nice with 2.6.0-test* kernel.I had to change the includes to blkdev
in the source and then there was few compile warnings.I can try to
provide the exact ones, unless there's a driver that applies to
2.6-test* cleanly.Once i had it compiled the kernel would just panic.

Is this due to my mainboard (nforce2),cpu,ACPI,devfs,sysfs...or all
these together?
I tried swapping the SCSI controller card in various PCI slots,used new
and original working cables,changed the BIOS IRQ's...etc
I start running of ideas here, is there other options to fully debug the
problem? What else can i try? I would appreciate any pointers.
I would like to get things working with 2.6.0 kernels...right now only
aic7xxx_old is somehow working but that's not the solution to the
problem.
