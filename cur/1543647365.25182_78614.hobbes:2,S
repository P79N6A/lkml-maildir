My thinking on this is that I'll have UML do the on-demand ticks.  So, on
a host with n UMLs, we will no longer have n * HZ timer deliveries/sec.
I haven't thought a lot about it, but this seems largely unconnected to how 
the host does its timers.
The one connection I can think of is that any generic support for on-demand
ticks would be re-used by UML.  And if UML required generic changes for this,
then that would obviously affect the other ports somehow.
