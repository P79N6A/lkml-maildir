I'm not overly keen on increasing the number of zones either but it is a
simplier approach, solves some of the problems and is less intrusive than
grouping pages by mobility so it's a reasonable starting point.

I tested your zone-configurable patch and they appear to work.  Your patch
builds whether ZONE_MOVABLE is available or not and ZONE_MOVABLE is only
available when the config option is set.  It is also considerably cleaner
than the patch I put together for a configurable ZONE_MOVABLE which is too
ugly to live in comparison.

I don't see off-hand how it's so different from normal memory hot-add
but I'll take your word for it. I'll keep an eye out for patches related
to it.
