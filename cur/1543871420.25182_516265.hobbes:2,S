This is just a coding style thing, but I thought I should really point it 
out, because these kinds of things quite often result in nasty bugs simply 
because the source code is so hard to read properly:

Ok, so here's the quiz: does this function return "true on success, false 
on failure", or does it return "zero on success, negative on failure"?

Ahh, it must be "true on success", right?

Ohh-oh! This is clearly a failure schenario! And indeed, 
"tick_init_highres()" will do the "negative on failure, zero on success" 
thing.
BUT! That means that you're testing the return value WRONG!
A function that returns a negative error value should be tested with
	if (tick_init_highres() < 0) {
		local_irq_restore(flags);
		return 0;
	}
because now you *see* that it's a failure.
So here's the coding style:
 - "true on success, false on failure" should be tested by just doing the 
   implicit test against zero (because that's how C booleans work!)
   Example:
	if (everything_is_done())
		return;
   Or:
	if (!something_worked_ok()) {
		printk("Aiee! Bug!\n");
		return;
	}
 - "negative error values" should preferably always be tested as such
	if (tick_init_highres() < 0) {
		printk("Aieee! Couldn't init!\n");
		return 0;
	}
   or, much better, actually use a temporary variable called "err" or 
   "error" or something, at which point "!error" is suddenly readable 
   again:
	err = tick_init_highres();
	if (!err)
		return;
I know this sounds stupid, but we've long since come to the point where 
source code readability on a *local* scale is damn important, simply 
because that's how people look at code: they may not always remember 
whether "zero is success" or "zero is false".
In general, I would suggest:
 - ALWAYS use "negative means error". If you had done that in this case, 
   then hrtimer_switch_to_hres() would have been a lot more readable, 
   *and* it could actually have returned the error code that it got to the 
   caller. In general, it's just more information when you see
	error = some_function();
	if (error)
		return error;
   because even if it may generate basically *exactly* same code as the 
   reversed "positive" version:
	if (!some_version_is_true())
		return 0;
   it simply has more semantic information for *humans*.
   And when you do this, *test it as such*. Either use an explicit "< 0" 
   so that you *see* that you're testing an error value, or use that 
   "retval/error = xyzzy()" pattern that is already showing "it's more 
   than just true/false"
 - use "true/false" only for things where it's *really* obvious that the 
   answer is never an error, and always a "was it true"?
Yeah, even so, the true/false kind of thing may be more common (especially 
with small helper functions that are literally *designed* to be used just 
as a conditional), but I think in this case, you really should have done 
it as a "returns error" function. Partly because now it was throwing away 
an error code, partly simply because in this case, it really wasn't about 
true/false as much as about "did something error out and keep it from 
succeeding?".
Maybe I'm just getting anal in my old age. I at one time tried to make 
sparse check for these things, but there was no really sane thing I could 
come up with (way way WAAY too much manual annotation).
I might have to break down and suggest people use
	bool somefunction(..)
	{
		if (... < 0)
			return false;
		...
		return true;
	}
just to (a) eventually have sparse check for these things but more 
importantly (b) have people see more at a glance whether a function is 
supposed to return "negative or success" or "true or false".
I've not generally been a huge fan of "boolean", especially in the 
traditional C kind of sense (capital screaming letters, and really just an 
"int" with lipstick). But with modern C, and "bool" defined as really 
holding just 0/1 (in practice - "unsigned char"), we could actually check 
these things (and verify with sparse that you never assign any integer 
except for 0/1 to a boolean, and otherwise always have to use a real 
boolean construct).
Thus endeth my overly long coding style rant.
