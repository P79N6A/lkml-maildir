Yeah, something along those lines would be great.  It would keep a big
(13 GB) drive to drive file copy from causing a large (400MB) and
relatively active process from having its memory swapped out (and then
back in 20 seconds later).
Imagine watching that for 45 minutes while a backup that used to take
5-8 minutes runs.
