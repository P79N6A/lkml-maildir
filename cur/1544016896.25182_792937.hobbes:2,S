Subject: [PATCH] atmel_pcm: Remove non-existant header
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

<mach/hardware.h> doesn't exist on AVR32 and therefore this driver won't
build on that arch.  AFAICT this driver doesn't actually use the content
of that header so easiest just to remove it.
