No -- I don't think there presently is.
I think Richard Gooch posted a patch so that this could be done ages
ago (via ioctl or something).
Userland doesn't (or shouldn't) need to know physical addresses
normally -- can you explain why you might need this?
(I'm not saying you don't, I've tested drivers from userland before,
so its conceivable there are uses for this)
