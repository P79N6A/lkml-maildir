I'll try to do that over the next couple weeks.

That's what I meant by "as long as the inode number is the same".  Since it
is a normal file, the only thing ext2resize might overlook would be the
inode number for the jounal that's kept in the super block.  If, in fact
ext2resize does decide to change inode numbers for some reason.  I don't
know if it does.

Yep.  It would be more important for data=journal mode.
Can ext2resize change the block size too?  If the journal is larger than
100MB then it would need to be made smaller for 1k blocks 200MB for 2k
blocks, and left at 400MB for 4k blocks.
