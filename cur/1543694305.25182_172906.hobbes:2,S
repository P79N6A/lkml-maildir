No benchmarks, only arguments:
- it's less tested (there might be miscompilations in some part of the 
  kernel with some supported compilers)
- there might be fast path code somewhere in the kernel that becomes
  significantely slower with -Os
- I've already seen a report for an ICE in gcc 2.95 of a user compiling
  kernel 2.4 with -Os [1]
