We need to transfer binary data records, and in case of an error
situation probably quite a number of them. Maybe sysfs could be bent to
that purpose but to me this seems even more awkward then a character 
device.

Our interface is supposed to work under memory constrained situations
e.g. when the connection to the storage device failed. With our character
device we can constrain memory allocations to uncritical situations:
- when error reporting is enabled
- when the device is opened
- when the internal buffer size is adjusted
The error reporting itself is done without any additional allocations.
