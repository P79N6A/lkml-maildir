IIRC cache colouring was introduced for some sun hardware with 2 memory busses:
one handes (addr%256<128), the other one (addr%256>=128)
If everything is perfectly aligned, the load one one bus was far higher than the
load on the other bus.
Probably there are similar problems when walking linked lists if the L1 cache
has a low associativity.

No, it doesn't:
HWCACHE_ALIGN means "do not cross a cache line boundary".
Thus all power-of-2 objects are unaffected.
It does waste a lot of space for 129 byte objects with HWCACHALIGN set: they are
rounded up to 256 bytes.
But that isn't new: 68 byte buffer heads on Athlon kernels were rounded to 128
bytes.
[btw, 128 bytes is the L2 cache line size. The L1 cache line size is 64 bytes]

That's another issue.
The question is who should decide about the cache colour offset?
a) the slab allocator always chooses the smallest sensible offset (i.e. the
alignment)
b) the caller can specify the offset, e.g. if the caller knows that the hot zone
is large he would use a larger colour offset.
Even if the hot zone is larger than the default offset, is there any advantage
of increasing the colour offset beyond the alignment?
I don't see an advantage.
