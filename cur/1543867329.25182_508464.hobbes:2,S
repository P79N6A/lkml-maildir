Regardless of what iwconfig reports as the mode or rate, you should be 
able to associate to an AP in either spectrum (2.4 or 5.2) using any 
valid rate.  Once configured and associated, iwconfig should provide 
more correct information.
If association is failing, verify that 'iwlist scan' shows the AP and 
that you specify everything for the association, eg:
    iwconfig wlan0 channel 8 essid MyAP ap 00:13:f0:0d:ca:fe
d80211 will only attempt to associate once -- if it fails, then you need 
to currently "de-configure" the device and reconfigure it back to what 
you want to associate to.  I do that here by chaging the AP BSSID to 
something else then changing it back.  If you use wpa_supplicant, it 
does the re-association attempts for you.
