Has anybody else seen this problem? Is it me or is it generic?
I am building 2.6.0-test2 on an ia32 box for use on an SH box (Dreamcast).
I am now building some modules (I am trying to write an ALSA module for the 
Dremcast's sound card) and when I use make ... modules_install, it installs 
them to the /lib/modules/2.6.0-test2-sh heirarchy as it should.
However, the running kernel, build with the same tools and often at the same 
time, thinks its a plain vanilla 2.6.0-test2 kernel and so tries to load 
modules from /lib/modules/2.6.0-test2.
