It may take multiple steps to identify a deadlock.  With the above
you'll miss deadlocks like
	process 1 is requesting a lock held by process 2
	process 2 is blocking on a lock held by process 3
	process 3 is blocking on a lock held by process 1.
Could you give more details about how you're causing
posix_locks_deadlock to hang?  Is there a simple test-case you can post?
