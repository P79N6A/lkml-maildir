Last time I looked into the inode stuff, it seems that it never frees
memory. So, except for systems that use an inode table that will grow up
to a large part of the memory, this change will be not better than a
placebo, and placebo are known to only work with humans for the moment. 
Btw, if the inode stuff would free memory on demand (8k on 4K page
systems), then it would just behave as a 8k chunks pool for the fork 
not to fail.
If we would apply that 8k granularity allocation to all parts that
allocate memory, then we would get a system that uses 8k pages virtualized
over 4k hardware virtual pages.  ;-) 
Since you seem to be a kernel champion, instead of implementating minute
patches, you should for example try to implement the following: 
1) Implement the virtualized kernel stack and fix any driver you are 
   using and that DMAs the stack. I can help you for that, but I
   doubt you need help for.
2) Compare the behaviour of the original kernel with the modified kernel.
   Btw, I doubt you will see significant performance differences at this
   step.
3) Now that you have got rid of the 8k allocation fork problem, you can
   also get rid of everything that tried to deal with this problem and 
   simplify some parts of the kernel.
4) Compare the behaviour of the original kernel with the modified kernel, 
   and observe which one behaves overall better.

   Gérard.
