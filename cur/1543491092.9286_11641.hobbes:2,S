I don't think I expressed myself very well there, but my reading of
the text you quoted is that it states that upgrading to the latest
release of sysklogd fixes the problem of sysklogd segfaulting under
2.2 kernels, and that "adding support for new features..." was a
side-effect of doing so, rather than helping with the problem quoted.

I didn't say the wording was perfect...
Basically, that help text is what's often referred to as a "Garden
Path" sentence, in that on first reading it, it appears to be
nonsense, and one has to go back and reread it several times before
the true meaning becomes apparent. It needs rewording to fix that
problem, and my version was an attempt to do so, but clearly isn't
suitable as the final version...
Best wishes from Riley.
