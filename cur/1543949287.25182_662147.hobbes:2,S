Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt says:
What: The arch/ppc and include/asm-ppc directories
When: Jun 2008
Why:  The arch/powerpc tree is the merged architecture for ppc32 and ppc64
      platforms.  Currently there are efforts underway to port the remaining
      arch/ppc platforms to the merged tree.  New submissions to the arch/ppc
      tree have been frozen with the 2.6.22 kernel release and that tree will
      remain in bug-fix only mode until its scheduled removal.  Platforms
      that are not ported by June 2008 will be removed due to the lack of an
      interested maintainer.
