It only warns with -W on, not with -Wall, so I see no compelling
reason to fix this.  I think the real problem here is that 'arg'
is declared 2 pages earlier in the function prototype (aka the
function-growth-hormone-imbalance syndrome).
There's two good ways of fixing this, adding a f_setsig() function:
static inline int f_setsig(struct file *filp, unsigned long arg)
{
	if (arg > _NSIG)
		return -EINVAL;
	filp->f_owner.signum = arg;
	return 0;
}
...
	case F_SETSIG:
		err = f_setsig(filp, arg);
		break;
or add a function that checks a variable to see if it's a valid signal number:
#define valid_signal(arg)	((unsigned long)arg <= _NSIG)
...
	case F_SETSIG:
		if (!valid_signal(arg))
			break;
		err = 0;
		filp->f_owner.signum = arg;
		break;
Looks like futex.c, ptrace.c, signal.c, sys.c and almost every
architecture's ptrace code could easily make use of the latter, but not
the former.  It also looks like we have a few off-by-one errors.  For
example, in h8300's ptrace code:
                case PTRACE_SYSCALL:
                case PTRACE_CONT: {
                        ret = -EIO;
                        if ((unsigned long) data >= _NSIG)
                                break ;
but
                case PTRACE_SINGLESTEP: {
                        ret = -EIO;
                        if ((unsigned long) data > _NSIG)
                                break;
so I'd recommend the second solution.  But be careful not to "fix up"
cases like:
./kernel/exit.c:        if (sig < 1 || sig > _NSIG)
where we really don't want to allow zero.
