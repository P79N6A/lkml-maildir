More details on the consumers of this data is available at

Thanks for clarifying.  I now understand your suggestion better.
The accounting is going to be frequent, with data from all tasks in the
system being collected and processed frequently. Since the accounting is
frequent, I think the current scheme works better than on-demand allocation.
