I can't see a security issue.  User may do a "chmod oug+rwx filename"
today, giving everybody else full access to their file(s).  The ability
to give the same free access to only a subset of everybody don't
seem dangerous to me.

ls is fixable.  Possibly by extending "ls -l" to show acl's or at
least indicate in some way that acl's are present.  The latter may
be preferable to avoid script incompatibilities, sonething like this:
Arw-r--r--   1 helge    helge         140 Feb  9  1999 .bash_profile
The 'A' indicates that acl(s) are present, the user may then use
something like "ls --acl" and get the full acl information.
