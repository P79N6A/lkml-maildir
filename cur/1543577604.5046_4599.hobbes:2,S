Subject: Bug in vfat-module in all kernel versions 2.4.0-testx and 2.4.0-prerelease

Hi,
there seems to be a bug in the vfat-module. When I mount my SCSI MO drive with a
512 bytes/block disk, everything works fine. If I do the same thing with a
disks with 2kB/block I can mount it and read the directory. Once I try to run a
programm from the disk or try to edit or copy a file in either direction, I run
into a segmention fault. Afterwards, the partition cannot be unmounted anymore.
(By the way, since the mtools don't need the kernel to read a disk, they work
fine on the very same disk. Kernel 2.2.14-SuSE works fine as well.)
Hope that helps.
-Thomas
