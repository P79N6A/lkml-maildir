There's not a lot in that menu. It holds oprofile on every arch I
grepped on. Oprofile might come across as being marked
non-experimental but that may very well be due to the assumption that
the menu that holds that option will enforce the EXPERIMENTAL check.
How many archs do you see where oprofile and kprobe defer on their
dependency on EXPERIMENTAL?
Removing the EXPERIMENTAL check from the instrumentation menu will
also require you to fix/double-check dependency on EXPERIMENTAL of
oprofile/kprobes, provided you know that for sure. Which would bring
you back to the same question you began with, namely, whether option
xyz is EXPERIMENTAL or not.
