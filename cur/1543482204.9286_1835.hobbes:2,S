Hi Elmer,

That's because the original author of xconfig filled their code with
cheesy assumptions and then xconfig quietly drops its marbles when its
assumptions are not met.  In this case, the assumption is that config
options are unique, and CONFIG_FB_ATY appears four times in
drivers/video/Config.in.
(It's not the fault of drivers/video/Config.in; the unfortunate guy who
wrote drivers/video/Config.in must have used up a lot of chickens and
goats making it work with xconfig at all!)
I haven't fixed this yet in 2.2.0-pre9-mec1, alas.  Soon.
Michael
