Subject: initrd's ramdisk mounted in read-only mode

Hmm. I was making boot image for CD with kernel-2.4.19 and found that 
ramdisk is mounted in read-only mode. On previous kernel 2.4.12 it was 
working ok.
I passed "rw" option according to initrd documentation and ramdisk was 
mounted in  rw modes.
I checked mount points by "cat /proc/mounts" and found that 
 	/dev/rootfs mounted on /
	/dev/root	       / 
If /dev/rootfs is mounted, is it mean, that there was an error during 
mounting ramdisk?
Why /dev/rootfs is still mounted? And why ramdisk is mounted in read-only 
mode?
Here it is my default  settings to grub-bootloader:
root=(fd0)
kernel=/boot/vmlinuz.gz root=/dev/ram0 load_ramdisk=1
initrd=/initrd.gz
Modified with rw option:
root=(fd0)
kernel=/boot/vmlinuz.gz root=/dev/ram0 init=/linuxrc rw load_ramdisk=1
initrd=/initrd.gz
Cheers,YP
