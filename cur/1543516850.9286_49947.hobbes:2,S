   Note that the char_buf buffer size is 2*TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE. However, all
   serial drivers check the value TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE in order to know whether
   the buffer is full or not.
   Is this correct?? Shouldn't the serial drivers be checking for
   2*TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE?? Aren't the serial drivers subutilizing the flip
   buffers in this way??
The existing code is correct.  The reason why the buffer is
2*TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE is that we're doing double buffering; first one half
of the buffer is filled, while the other half is being processed by the
line discpline, and then the two (half) buffers are flipped --- this the
name "flip buffers".  It really is double buffering by another name; I
wasn't familiar with the more commonly used name when I reinvented the
technique for Linux.  :-)
   Another question: if I want to use a larger flip buffer, can I just
   allocate the required memory amount and set the pointers char_buf_ptr and
   flag_buf_ptr?? If not, I don't see the reason for the existence of these
   pointers ...
You have to change the routines that set and reset those pointers when
the flip buffers are flipped.  There is a patch outstanding to allow
bigger flip buffers, and I'll hopefully have a chance to look at it over
Thanksgiving weekend.  (My apologies Pavel for my delay in looking over
your patch; I've been swamped lately.)
