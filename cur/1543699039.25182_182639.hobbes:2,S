Local APIC gives you:
- using the local APIC timer instead of the mobo's legacy timer
- thermal management interrupts on P4s (dunno about K7s/K8s)
- performance counter interrupts, which can be used as an NMI
  source (watchdog, profiling) or for performance analysis
I/O-APIC gives you:
- more interrupt vectors ==> less IRQ sharing ==> improved
  stability and performance
- lower-overhead interrupt management
- I/O-APIC NMI watchdog (another timer with NMI delivery mode)
