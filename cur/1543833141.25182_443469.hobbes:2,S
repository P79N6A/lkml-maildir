No it is not just the same.  There is not global enable bit, only
per irq enables.  There is always a mask bit.  The ht irq generates
a 0 byte (with magic defines for the 32 byte enables) write while an
msi generates a 4 byte write with no byte enables.  With ht irqs
the maximum number of irqs is 120 not the one with plain MSI or
the 4k with MSI-X.
But from the perspective of using them in a driver the concept really
is the same.

The code that breaks it is only in -mm.  It's scheduled for 2.6.19.
All of the MSI magic in ioapic land on i386 and x86_64 is deleted.
The code just needs to age a bit and let the few unexpected
corner case crop up, and get sorted out.
Hopefully fixing the ipath driver is one of the things we can sort out.

request_irq is still needed.  The question is how do you get the irq.

The HT and msi semantics are moderately different, but I have
implemented the equivalent of pci_enable/disable_msi.  So the
code is not a pci standard but just a ht standard I didn't use the
pci prefix.

The reason I did not reuse code from msi.c is that the code in msi.c
is absolutely terrible.  Also note that even the different flavors
of msi have their own enable/disable routines.
I expect I will make msi.c match htirq.c instead of the other way around.
Of course I don't expect the interface exported to drivers to change.
