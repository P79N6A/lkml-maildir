hmm, this sounds a bit odd, there must be only one "physical address
space", the whole point of the change is to have only one and to kill
all the aliasing issues this way. In turn also set_blocksize will be
nearly a noop and it won't matter anymore the granularity of the I/O,
there won't be alias allowed anymore because the backing store of the
cache (the "physical address space") will be shared by all the users
regardless of the blocksize.
getblk should unconditionally alloc a new bh entity and only care to map
it to the right cache backing store with a pagecache hash lookup.
