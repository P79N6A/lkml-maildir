true. as i said before i'm glad we have such a 'tight' stable kernel
maintainer. :)
the problem is, NFS updates /never/ make it in - well once, but even
then not the complete NFSv2 update.
as for tulip, i know what you mean. however, i think in this case
you'd be very hard pressed to find anyone for whom the patches are
anything but a vast improvement.
anyway... i've gone hoarse now. better stop. :)
