The replacement looks, to my eye, to be logically correct.  The patch was
pretty clean.
Then again, I haven't looked at what is "under the hood" of the accessor
functions.  Perhaps there is a side-effect somewhere in there?
Perhaps a quick debugging test -- print the value of scsi_get_resid(srb)
just after it's initialized to zero at the top of
usb_stor_invoke_transport(), and then just after the call to
us->transport().
The first print should show a value of zero.  The debug log says that the
transport should have left it as zero.  If it's actually coming back from
us->transport() as a non-zero value, then we'll need to check all the
modifications to usb_stor_Bulk_transport to see where srb->resid is being
changed.
