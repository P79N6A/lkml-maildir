Could we also have an interface to serial devices which bypass the tty
layer?  Ie a /dev/ttyraw* which just speaks to the serial port without
going through the labyrinthine tty layers?
This would need to keep some basic ioctls for changing baud rate etc.
9 times out of 10 when I reach for /dev/ttyS* that is all I want and
the tty layer is just wasteful and gets in the way of a conceptually
very simple device.

Gets my vote.
