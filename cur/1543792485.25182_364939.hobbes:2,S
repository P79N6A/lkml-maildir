As I recall, this didn't always work; e2fsprogs falls back to using a
binary search using SEEK_SET to find the device size.  Folks who need
to do this should look at lib/ext2fs/getsize.c in the e2fsprogs
sources; it has ioctl's and other procedures for determining block
device size for Linux, *BSD, MacOSX, as well a generalized binary
search algorithm.
