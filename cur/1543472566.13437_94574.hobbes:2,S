Hello all. Has anybody else noticed this? All versions of Netscape
that I have used have a memory leak in the input box, so I get to test
what happens when VM is exhausted on a regular basis :-).
2.0.36: System goes into a bit of a swap storm, gets very sluggish, but I can
switch to another window and kill Netscape.
2.1.131: System goes into a furious swap storm, when try to switch to
another window "X" locks up, cannot move mouse pointer, reset switch
time.
Has anybody else noticed this?
