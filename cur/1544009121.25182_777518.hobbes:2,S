Well, it is a public health problem, since dirty feet in Penguins can spread
numerous diseases.
Imagine the *horror* if your box got the dreaded dancing-penguin disease
from those nasty dirty feet, and started trying to sing and dance... while
still booting!  It would be quite out of wack, and be horribly off-tune!
And if it happens on a PeeCee, it would be trying to sing its lungs off
through the DREADED PeeCee Squeaker...
That just Cannot Be Allowed To Happen(TM).

It is an one line change that can save us from untold horrors!  I call that
a patch well deserving of being in a stable release ;-)
