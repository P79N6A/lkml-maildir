I see you have.
And MIPS CPUs doesn't allow kernel pages to be remapped either.

I know we can place the kernel in any address though there
exist some exceptions.
I know mapping kernel pages to the same virtual address only helps
to avoid caring about physical addresses or vmalloc'ed addresses
when linking the kernel. I think it wouldn't be bad idea in many
architectures. I prefer it rather than linking the kernel for each
system.

I agree that my idea is not essential at the moment.
