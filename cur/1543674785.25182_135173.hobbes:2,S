Thanks Mikael and Vojtech,
I tried both bootloaders (LILO and Grub) and still can't seem to get the 
floppy controller detected with 2.4.21-rc3.
I tried the latest stock RedHat kernel (2.4.20-13.9) and it seems to work.
It sounds like Alan might have fixed something and hasn't told us what it 
was yet :-).  The RedHat kernel says:
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
With 2.4.21-rc3 I get:
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
floppy0: no floppy controllers found
One other interesting bit that shows up in the RedHat dmesg is:
SiS pirq: advanced IDE/ACPI/DAQ mapping not yet implemented
advanced SiS pirq mapping not yet implemented
The motherboard has the SiS746 chipset along with the 963 southbridge.
I apparently copied an old dump (by hand) of the problem.  The patch
by Vojtech Pavlik for the SIS southbridge detects the 963 without
a problem.  I also added the Bios Enhanced Disk Device Service 3.0 patch 
(CONFIG_EDD) to the source.

I still get "no floppy controllers found" 
I am open to suggestions....
Thanks,
Dave
