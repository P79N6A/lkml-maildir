I think most of the problem is that once it got down to the scsi layer,
there were some bugs with data direction, and it confused things like
usb-storage and sbp2 on firewire.
Those bugs were fixed. Note, I did not test the ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL fix
with WRITE commands after going to -rc6 (I used -rc5 for testing), so
those direction fixes may actually make ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL work.
However, I don't see the issue with using READ. We know this isn't a
write operation, we are sending a single command with no data. I know
you say reads are precious, but 3 requests for something that isn't
going to happen very often doesn't seem that bad.
As for the 0x01, I don't know. The eject -s code does the exact same
thing (AMR, SS:0x01, SS:0x02), so I copied the same mechanism because it
is known to work.
