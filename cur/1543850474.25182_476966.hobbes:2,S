can we put something in feature-removal that we'll undo this in say 6
months?
ndiswrapper is easy to fix to not use the internals of the queue_work
api, and just use schedule_work() instead. At that time the
functionality as a whole is still the right one.
(it's a separate question if ndiswrapper should be in this table;
driverloader should be, it's non-GPL at all, so that part of your patch
is broken)
