I don't see how this explanation can be correct.  The error handler only
sends a START_STOP command if sdev->allow_restart is one, which you have
to set in the slave_configure routines (which stex doesn't).  If you're
seeing a START_STOP in the eh path, there's something else wrong.
TEST_UNIT_READY, certainly ... it's part of a restart check.
