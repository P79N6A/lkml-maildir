Heh, you get as many answers to that one as their are SSD manufacturers.
However, the consensus seems to be that all MLC and SLC flash has a RAID
like architecture internally, thus it can actually be *faster* if you
send multiple commands (each area of the RAID processes independently).
Of course, you have to be *able* to send multiple commands, so the
device must implement TCQ/NCQ, but if it does, it's actually beneficial
*not* to wait even if the requests are adjacent.
However, the reason the nonrotational flag is set from user space is
precisely so if we do find an SSD that has this property, we can just
not set the nonrotational queue flag.
