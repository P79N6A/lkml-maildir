i've uploaded -T7:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc4-mm1-T7
Changes since -T6:
- further stabilization of PREEMPT_REALTIME: fixed the task-reaping
  problem by moving TASK_ZOMBIE out of p->state and thus completely
  separating preemption from the child-exit mechanism. This got rid of 
  the 'Badness in exit.c' warnings on my SMP testbox (and related
  crashes).
- fixed the _mutex_trylock_bh missing symbol problem reported by K.R. 
  Foley and Florian Schmidt.
- turned the sysrq lock into a raw spinlock, to enable direct keyboard
  irqs.
PREEMPT_REALTIME is still experimental, but it's already looking much
better on my testboxes.
to create a -T7 tree from scratch the patching order is:
