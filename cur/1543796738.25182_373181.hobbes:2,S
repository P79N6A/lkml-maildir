1) Lots of problems have been fixed that trigger that bug message,
   please give 2.6.15-rc5 a spin.
2) You didn't give what the failure mode is for kernels such
   as 2.6.14.2, which should work, and certainly don't print out
   that bug message
3) Finally, this discussion belongs on sparclinux@vger.kernel.org (CC'd),
   not linux-kernel.
