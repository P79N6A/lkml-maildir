Dennis,
you have a VIA kt8235 Southbrigde?
You need kernel >= 2.4.20-rc2, to get UDMA working with that chipset.
Of course, as Tomas pointed out, latest ac has much more ide improvements, so 
it probably would do even better with kt8235.
But >= 2.4.20-rc2 works like a charm here for me with the via kt8235.
