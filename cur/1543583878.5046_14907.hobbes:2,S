For research, I suggest a look at getopt(3) or whatever it's called.
The command line args are seperated into chunks based upon what got
seperated into argv[1]....[n], delimited by (hold my breath) white-space.
Of course, it's not getopt(), but "makeopt()" that we are looking for.
...Whatever chopped up those command-line arguments in the first place.
If __that__ corresponds so POSIX rules, then whatever follows must
also comply.
