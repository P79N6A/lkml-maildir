I've been running a DPT SmartCache IV PCI (2044UW, I think) using the eata
driver on my SMP system under the 2.2 kernels without any problem.  Right
now, I have 2.2.10 installed.
The system specs are:
2x Pentium II 350MHz
128 MB RAM
DPT SmartCache IV PCI 2044UW, no cache RAM, no RAID
several assorted UW and narrow SCSI disks & CDROMs
Linux 2.2.10 SMP
eata driver
My understanding is that the eata_dma driver is broken under SMP and isn't
maintained anymore.
