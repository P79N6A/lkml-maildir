 now, this is getting off-topic. The CD image I proposed would be only
for the hard disks.
 Bootable XXXX-Dos floppy images that one could just "dd" of the floppy
would be great, because they eliminate the need for "the other OS", but
you still need a floppy drive. I am not sure how many Notebook owners
actually have one. The hardest part in my FW upgrade was actually
finding a drive in our company.
