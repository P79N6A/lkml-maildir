Fix pcibios_find_device().  This is already fixed in the 2.2 kernel series,
but in 2.0.x there is a bug where, depending on the order in which those
funtion 0 and 1 devices are ordered in the device list, a
pcibios_find_device() call with an index of 1 returns nothing even though the
call with in index of 0 returns the channel A device and 1 should return the
channel B device.
