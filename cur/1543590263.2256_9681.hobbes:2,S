Well lets see.....
I lost my ISP (NorthPoint + PacBell)			4/18/2001
There was a T13 meeting the following week.		4/23/2001
Found a flaw in the tests of writecaching.
Reverified the contents of the CODE base to match SPEC	4/29/2001
Reverified that certain hosts are not good.
(oh two kids that were ill and then the wife)
Reconfigure the "CAVE" where I do all of my work.
Write 90% of 48-bit LBA, use/test the hostswap for large/huge drives.  
Look at the user API and chuckled then cried and roared aloud......
Figure out License for the "ide-service.o" module.
	It will not be GPL but a very strict LAD (BSD-ish) License.
	Reasons will follow, but I will not be liable for stupid usage.
So if you are reallying dying to test code that has not been full shaken
down and requires a huge page for the glue, I will post one.
The service utility is not ready yet so it is no good without one.
