OK. So at least they are open to it. Maybe they should drop a binary somewhere to get a start. It's not what you want in the long term, but I think good enough for now. Then we should work something out for the frequency settings.
What about the access points? There is nothing dangerous to set, so that information (or drivers and applications) can be given free. Does anyone know more about this?
I tried to get some info from an Edimax AP, but no success (yet). They used a PRISM chipset, but their own microcontroller and stuff for the USB instead of the chip from Intersil. So I guess that that will become difficult.

Bas.
