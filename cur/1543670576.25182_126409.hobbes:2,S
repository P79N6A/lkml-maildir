That's not correct either.
I will refuse a patch that just takes "dev_t", since I just think that's 
stupid.
The kernel should get major and minor numbers. It's a sad mistake that 
UNIX uses "dev_t" in the first place, and clearly the glibc interface to 
user mode will have to be that historical braindamage. But we should 
realize that the _right_ interface is keeping the <major, minor> tuple 
explicit, and any new system call interfaces should be of that type.
