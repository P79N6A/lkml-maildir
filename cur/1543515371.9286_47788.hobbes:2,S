To me, the obvious answer to this is the one I proposed over a year
ago - have the kernel stored in linux-`uname -r` by default. It was
thrown out because Linus considered that change to be too much work on
his part, or so I was told.
Personally, I would say that this topic can be debated until kingdom
come, but it won't make the slightest difference unless and until
Linus decides to do something about it.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
