Unfortunately my brain is not on the same level and scope as Alexey or davem. 
I simply don't grok those pages. I also note caveats about incompleteness, and 
recommendation to use libnetlink, which is also not documented much.
I sometimes hack on zcip (see 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/zcip
 
for an out of date version), and it could really use some netlink-ification. 
But I can't even follow enough of iproute (or zebra, which also uses netlink, 
AFAICT) to figure out how to do basic stuff like a list of configured 
networking devices, or set the default route.
