It will only work if we can walk the VMA lists associated with the
page from IRQ context.  By that I mean the address_space vma lists
as well as the anonymous memory list.

If that's all that kmap could do, it would solve the issues with PIO,
but not things like fuse and the other users of get_user_pages() with
the current context.  All those would remain potential sources of data
corruption.
My current attempt at solving this (following David's advice for anon
pages in flush_dcache_page()) is as follows (which involves duplicating
bits of mm/rmap.c) but I remain unconvinced that this is safe from all
contexts which flush_dcache_page() may be called from.
Given where we are in the -rc cycle, I feel that my original two patches
are far safer to solve the problems reported so far - especially as they've
been tested.  If someone can come up with a better way, then we can look
to implementing that instead once 2.6.20 has happened.
