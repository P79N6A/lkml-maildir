Hi Hanna!
if you need a 'quick' cross compiling solution
next time, you can use the cross compiling at
 
http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Stuff/Cross/
 
http://vserver.13thfloor.at/Stuff/Cross/howto.info
if I get around, I'll update it to recent 3.4
compilers but 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 works fine ...
HTH,
Herbert
