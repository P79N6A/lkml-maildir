Well, originally - I merely pointed out that __volatile__ is needed in
get_cycles() of 2.2.4 and it was accepted in 2.2.5. It was also said that
with
__volatile__ get_cycles() can be used for profiling but the word I chose
was "pseudo-profiling" because of the speculative execution nature of P6
family. To make "pseudo-profiling" a real "profiling" a separate version
of get_cycles() would be needed (i.e. not to cause unneeded overhead in
the current use in schedule()/SMP) and you implemented various forms of
it (since it looked fun :).
Regards,
Tigran.
