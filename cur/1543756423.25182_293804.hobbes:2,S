Well, since I'm a known glutton for punishment. ;)
a 2.6.11-rc3-RT tree I had handy from last night shows about a 0.5% size reduction:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
3033417  680824  436188 4150429  3f549d vmlinux.before
3017443  681068  436188 4134699  3f172b vmlinux
Am running a 2.6.11-rc3-mm1-RT kernel with it applied, and have probably 40-50
hours of uptime on it with no noticed issues on a Dell laptop.  Sorry, don't
have any comparative performance stats...
