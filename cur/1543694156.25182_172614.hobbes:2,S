Hi Martin/Vojtech,
Martin, many thanks for your fix - it works perfectly now.
Oddly enough the sample rate of 200 seems to have fixed the problem.
Vojetech,  Martin's fixes are fully functional. If you want to keep it at 80,
I'd recommend that you make the sample rate a module config option so that
users may be able to tweak this for their systems.
The default of 200 has been tested on VIA400 and IntelICH5 systems that I have.
One running Redhat9/2.6.0-test7 and the other running Gentoo 1.4/2.6.0-test7
best regards
