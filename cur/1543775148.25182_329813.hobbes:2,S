-O2 will have some effect.  The compiler might optimize away variables
(including function arguments) and doesn't always record that fact in
the debug information.
But the real killer here is probably -fomit-frame-pointer.  Last time I
looked GCC didn't generate the correct debug information in that case.
I didn't really look into this, but it seemed as if GCC blindly produces
location descriptions relative to the frame pointer even though there no
longer is a frame pointer.  GCC 4.0 or 4.1 might have this fixed.

If you're prepared to do some more tests, you might want to check out
what happens if you leave out -O2 and -fomit-frame-pointer, and then add
back only -O2
