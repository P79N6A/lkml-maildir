It is bad to see, that you are the only person in this thread who
seems to did already think about the problem and who tries to find
a useful solution.
Nearly all other people only track personal wishes and aversions.
To find a useful solution, we need a tecnical and knowledge base
driven idea - not only trying to prevent other people's ideas to become
reality.
