Well, I'm not sure what you mean by "requires" b43, but I did say that
the device uses the b43 driver.

Sorry, I should have been more specific. I figured since the device
could use bcm43xx, it could also use b43legacy, so I copied the
entries in b43_ssb_tbl[] to b43legacy_ssb_tbl[] and rebuilt the
b43legacy driver. I removed the b43 and ssb modules, and inserted the
b43legacy module. Afterwards, I noticed b43 had still been autoloaded,
so I removed it (I checked dmesg and only b43legacy had initialized
anyway) , and proceeded to use the b43legacy driver with the version 3
firmware. And like I said, it works exactly like the b43 driver with
the version 4 firmware.
I'm not sure if it was the best way to go about it, but it worked.
