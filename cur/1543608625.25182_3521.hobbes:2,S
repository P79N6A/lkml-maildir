The only writing to the drives, will be weekly batch jobs running at
night. I originally planned to disable all or at least most loggin, but I
changed my mind to allow for logging to an NFS volume on a separate
management segment. Thus, there's virtually no writing in the system while
it's running. Therefor - again - I'd like to run software RAID 4, as
this'll give me read access to what looks like a RAID 0 (the n-1 data
drives), and although writing will be a pain in the ass, reading will be
fast, and I have some sort of redundancy.
What would you think would be a good stripe size in these circumstances
(>=1GB files)
