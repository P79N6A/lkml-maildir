Ok, with this argument, I finally get it. Now I know why you do it this
way. You let the lld driver suggest a class for it's devices and verify
these suggestions by high level code. 
The only way to get to this classification data is by resetting the ATA
device.
It might be technically possible to set ->class directly and 
fix it up in high level logic, as needed.
Your explicit design decision was NOT to do this but to put this
suggestions from low level driver into a temporary on stack structure
from the higher level API.
And since the maintainer is happy already, I couldn't care less.
Thanks for your patience :-)
