So which way you can call it "Unix" is unclear to me. Unix-like -- all right.
Unix -- no.

Hmm. I think. Think once more. Directory was text file initially and was
modified by suid mkdir program when needed. It's changed now. Why ? It was
so wonderfull idea ! /dev is not filesystem now but bunch of special files.
Why to have special files and not special filesystem is so wonderfull idea ?

Once more: Linux is not Unix. At least just now. Neither certified as Unix nor
derived from Unix sources...

You mean that the only reason to reject devfs is troubles with VFS ? Hmm.
For last two years devfs was adopted to changing VFS all right. Or you changed
VFS with devfs in mind ??? Hard to believe. Yes, it uses VFS non-standard way.
Now what ? What planned VFS change will unrepairable break devfs ?

Yes, this will need a lot of peoples with deep knowleadge of kernel. That's
why it's not happen yet and hardly happens soon (devfs is great thing but not
great enough to justify kernel fork).

Problems are solved by Richard mostly. So far I hear only about one technical
problem with devfs (from you BTW): problems with VFS (which one BTW: rename is
not implemented in procfs and procfs is included in kernel; what's is so
different in devfs?). This is THE ONLY REAL problem. All other problems are
myths or political ones. Is it the only reason to not include devfs in kernel ?
BTW what about devpts and procfs: are they any better from VFS side ? They are
both in kernel and devpts was added when devfs already existed...

Hmm. Looking on messages published there for last few days you hardly can say
that :-) If the only reasons to not include devfs in kernel are technical ones
then what are they ? If there are some reasons then WHERE should are they be
discussed ? For devfs to be included in kernel ALL reasons should be resolved...

BTW why there are no such summary anywhere ? So you can say: "devfs is great,
but there are problems: 1) ..., 2) ..., 3) ...; go away and return back when
are they are solved -- if they are will be solved devfs will be included in
kernel". So far I've not seen messages from peoples who can say to Linus "now
devfs is ok from subsystem I maintain in Linux kernel and you can take a look
on it". Since devfs touches quite a few subsystems devfs should be adopted to
have "Ok" from some top kernel hackers before Linus will try to look on it.

There are quite a few things in kernel not welcomed by Linus initially.
But in case with devfs I can not see technical problems at all -- just
political ones. There are problem with rename, for example, but procfs also
has it AFAIK. Why it's Ok for procfs and not Ok for devfs ?
