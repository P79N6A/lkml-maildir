They already have to do this because of the sata_nv module for one
example where ordering matters. So it's already the case, and it has to
be dealt with run time because the resolution is dynamic and depends upon
user configurable boot settings.

That feature is lacking in the PCI layer at the moment which is
problematic. When the PCI layer develops this feature I'll make use of
it. In the mean time send patches to Greg KH for that if you want to hack
on it.
