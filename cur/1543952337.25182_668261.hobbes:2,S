I suspect Adam has a terminology problem and he likely meant "unmapped
page cache" instead of buffer cache.
In Linux "buffer cache" only refers to file system
metadata (like file system bitmaps etc.), but he likely meant 
all file data which is in the page cache. The page cache is not 
limited by the kernel virtual memory split. In fact buffer
cache is a special case of the page cache too
iirc even large parts of the buffer cache can be highmem
depending on the file system.
