I didn't realise there were so many of these patch sets still to go.  I
could probably help out with some of them.  Is there somewhere we could
keep track of which ones are left to do, and who is handling them?  If
it would be helpful, I could go through all of the semaphore uses in the
tree and try to figure out which (if any) are true counting semaphores
that cannot be converted, and then I could post/send the list of
convertible cases.  Would that be helpful, or has it already been done
somewhere else?
