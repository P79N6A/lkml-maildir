Actually, with 100 processes mapping a 1 GB area of shared
memory, you'll need about 100 MB of page tables or 10% of
the SHM segment. This rises even further with PAE and/or
more processes.
The page table cost for heavily shared memory segments is
really getting out of hand, IMHO ... it might be worth it
to set aside a separate memory zone and use 4 MB pages for
the SHM segment.
