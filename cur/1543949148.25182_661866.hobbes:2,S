fs/partitions/msdos.c: In function 'msdos_partition':
fs/partitions/msdos.c:446: warning: comparison is always true due to limited range of data type
didn't you get this?
The reason is that FAT_VALID_MEDIA() is bogus:
#define FAT_VALID_MEDIA(x)      ((0xF8 <= (x) && (x) <= 0xFF) || (x) == 0xF0)
It appears that the on-disk field which FAT_VALID_MEDIA() is designed to
test is only 8-bit, so the comparison with 0xff is pointless.  The only
existing caller of FAT_VALID_MEDIA() cheats by copying the value into a
local unsigned int first.
So I'll leave things as they are for now, but I'd ask that someone can
confirm that we should simply remove the 0xff test from FAT_VALID_MEDIA()?
