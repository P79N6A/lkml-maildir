Blinders ehh... Well, if you would care to ask I would answer.
In reality, what you point out is actually a non-issue since the hard-rt
user-land tasks are not allowed to call on normal Linux services. They
can only call on RTAI services which are exported by an extra soft-int.
These services are hard-rt, so there's no problem there.
Please, download the thing and play with it. Or, at the very least, ask
about how it works and we'll be glad to explain.
