Bottom line is - today there is lack of support for it, and for some companies it 
means loosing money. Tomorrow there will be support for all raid0 variants, but 
as well some kind of new unsupported hw/technology - hence gap is still there, 
spiral thing :-( Nothing we can do here but to improve support in Linux today in
a hope it will take bigger market share tomorrow.

  It depends on your memory manager. Virtual DMA services (aka VDS) are there and being
used from 1992 (for instance, in emm386 - Linux's memory management is more powerfull than that).
