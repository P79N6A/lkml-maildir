Err - just use EVIOCSKEYCODE to swap the keycodes around,  this works
in terms of the evdev keycodes.  I use it in a small program to swap
around a bunch of keys.
A bit more of a challange would be listening to evdev,  and when
detecting the 'swap' keycode,  doing the reload with the actual swaps.
I'm not sure w/o reading the code if the kernel will allow this to be
shared between the tty and evdev on the same vt,  but then one could
run a controller program talking through a pty and direct to the keyboard.
