How about a security policy that says:
1) Thou mayest do an 'modprobe wvlan_cs'
2) Thou mayest not do 'modprobe wvlan_cs eth=0'.
'eth=0' causes it to create the interface as 'wvlan0' 'wvlan1' etc rather
than 'eth0', 'eth1', etc.  This makes a difference if you have iptables
rules that say '-i eth+' or '-i wvlan+' that implement different rulesets
for wireless and hard-wired connections.
