i'm not sure what the patch is trying to achieve, but this part of
mcsched-2.4.13-0.4.diff looks incorrect:
+               prev->cpu_jtime += (jiffies - prev->sched_jtime) + jiffies;
(this is "2*jiffies - prev->sched_jtime" which doesnt appear to make much
sense - does it?)
and your patch adds a scheduling advantage to processes with more cache
footprint, which is the completely opposite of what we want.
but in any case, changing the goodness() function was not a goal of my
patch, i change the granularity of how processes lose their 'effective
priority'.
