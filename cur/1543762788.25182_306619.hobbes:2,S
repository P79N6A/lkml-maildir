Hi,
I am working in 10 msec tick, and run separate task with the /dev/rtc that 
operate in 1/1024 sec
(about 1 msec).
I see that the RTC task is activated every 1 msec (as expected).
Can anybody explain how the scheduler is activated each 1 msec, although the 
minimal time
slice is 10 msec.
What I am looking for is the exact function/mechanism that causes this high 
frequency scheduling
(the function I am looking for is called from the IRQ 8 interrupt handler, 
but what is it????)
Sincerely
Shai Lifshitz
