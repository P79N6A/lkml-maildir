  I got do my one work, but I spend some enoght time until get it work.
Following the "try/error" method, I got do it work by :
   1)Disabling the support to pnp
   2)Disabling the support to new irq automatic detect item
   3)Enabling only ALSA build-in (no open sound, as the docs say to do)
   4)Enabling evey option about ALSA, but about the specific chipset only the
one - NVidia2
  The machine was one with a asus A7N8X-X (nvidia2 chipset).
