     I'm posting this one last report.  At this point I'm building non-SMP
kernels and letting 3 of the CPU's sit idle per David Miller's suggestion.  I
don't have money to go out and buy all new Ultra hardware (David's other
suggestion) to replace the Hypersparc machines I presently have.
     From a CPU occupancy standpoint I have no reason to, the news box runs at
an average 9% occupancy and the web server 15% when all four CPU's are in
service.  I guess I'll either suffer along in single CPU mode, put up with
instability, or find another OS unless someone else has an idea what is causing
this. 
     To re-cap, on this particular lock-up, the machine in question is Quad CPU
Ross Hypersparc SS-10 with 384MB of RAM, running Apache 1.3.3p3.  Machine
handles approximately 1 million hits per day and gets web pages from a shell
server running SunOS 4.1.4 via NFS.  The only extra card in the machine other
than the CPU modules is a CG6 video board.  It does have some local disk used
for root, /usr, /var, /tmp, swap, etc, but web pages are on a different
machine. 
     This crash the following message printed repeatively:
spin_lock (f0155f6c) CPU#3 stuck at f002dc7c, owner PC(f0020a40): CPU(0)

     If anybody has any helpful suggestions besides buy new hardware, please
let me know.
     I'm afraid I don't have the old .Configure since I re-configured the OS
for single CPU operation but it is essentially the same as the one from the
previous post as I had kernels on both machines configured the same.
