In which case the receive_chars() function gobbles up to 255 characters
from the device before relinquishing to the main interrupt loop.  The
main interrupt loop has two exit conditions - no further interrupts
are pending from any device, or we run this loop 256 times.
In the case where further characters are waiting, we will re-run the
receive_chars() function.
Hence, we will check the device up to 256 times and each will potentially
receive 255 characters, which gives about 64K of character reception
before the warning triggers.
Therefore, this scenario is _very_ _very_ unlikely.

Again, only if there's more than about 64K of data waiting.
