Subject: how about bringing Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt up to date?

  as time goes by, the informational value of the feature removal file
is rapidly approaching zero, as alleged deadlines for removal are
continually dismissed, while some removal dates as far back as 2005
are still in that file.
  if those features aren't going to be removed, then will someone at
least recalibrate their removal dates and update that file?
