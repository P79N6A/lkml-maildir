My reasoning is that the choice of computer is a direct function of
your financial situation. I can get hold of a lot of 386's/486's, but
however old a Pentium may be, people are still reluctant to give away
those. Doing the sometimes necessary updates on my 386:en is already
painfully slow, and I'd rather not take another performance hit.

Yes, I realise that. But if _distribution X_ drops support for the 386,
there's always _distribution Y_ available with it still in, while if
we give the glibc-people the thumbs up saying "Ignore the 386 users from
now on", every distribution will get lousy performance on those machines.

Well, not all 386:en are early...
