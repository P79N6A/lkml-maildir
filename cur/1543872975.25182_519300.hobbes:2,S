The problem is really the
   serial->port[i] = NULL;
line after device_unregister() which is used to flag "fake" devices
that don't need legacy cleanup later in the destrol_serial.  That
flagging should be done using a *real* flag, and not by overloading
the ->port[i] pointer since we require it to be non-NULL in
->shutdown() in all drivers that are not converted to new
->port_probe()/->port_remove() framework (currently all except ftdi).
I'll work on a patch to do that, but for now, I think you should apply
Mark's patch to revert the order change since the FTDI driver no
longer requires the correct ordering of device_unregister() and
->shutdown().
