That's a rather kind assessment; I suppose I hold flaws not critical at
the design level as fatal where those who look primarily at design don't.

Well, that's more or less consistent with what I'm I'm doing. In
actuality it's Hugh's design and original implementation, but I'm going
to have to claim _some_ credit for the work I've put into this at some
point, though it be grunt work after a fashion.
The nontrivial point is largely ABI compatibility. A tremendous amount
of diff could be eliminated without ABI compatibility; however, the
concern is rather critical as long as legacy binaries are involved.

My reasoning here has actually been dominated by performance. Exchanging
the logic for this task is actually a difficult enough operation with
respect to programming that very few a priori concerns can be allowed
any influence at all.
The algorithm now used for fault handling, recently ported by brute
force from Hugh's rather ancient sources, effectively does as you say
(though there is a lot of latitude in the criterion you've stated).
One risk I've taken is updating some API's to return pfn's instead of
pages. In the case of get_user_pages() this is likely essential. But
kmap_atomic_to_page() (to_pfn() in my sources) and some others might
be able to be avoided entirely with some moderately traumatic rework
(traumatic as far as work I have to do is concerned; in all honesty,
the issue is stupid, but as a problem it makes up for the lack of
difficulty owing to quality with that owed to vast quantities of
debugging and intolerance to dumb C mistakes.) The methods you're
suggesting suggest removing these changes in exchange for some
potential inefficiencies with virtualspace consumption, though these
are not entirely out of the question, as ia32 is effectively deprecated.
