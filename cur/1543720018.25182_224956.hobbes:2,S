The whole point of NX, though, is that it prevents certain classes of 
exploits.  If a setuid binary is vulnerable to one of these, then Ingo's 
patch "fixes" it.  Your approach breaks that.
I don't like Ingo's fix either, though.  At least it should check 
CAP_PTRACE or some such.  A better fix would be for LSM to pass down a flag 
indicating a change of security context.  I'll throw that in to my 
caps/apply_creds cleanup, in case that ever gets applied.
