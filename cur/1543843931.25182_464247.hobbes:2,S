I am open to make LTTng support kprobes as a commodity (in fact, this point has
been on the LTTng project roadmap for almost a year). But in no way does it
solve the entire tracing problem. As an example, LTTng traces the page fault
handler, when kprobes just can't instrument it.
I keep thinking that a complete marker mechanism must have the ability to be
turned into function calls or inline functions when necessary.
Going further, we could think of a marker mechanism that would be aware of the
"difficulty" level of the probe, so that even if CONFIG_KPROBELOG is selected,
it would use a direct call or inlined function for probing the page fault
handler.
i.e. :
"normal" (nothing, kprobe, jumpprobe, printk or tracer)
MARK(eventname, "%d %s", myint, mystring);
"cannot be probed dynamically" (used in kprobes itself, page fault handler)
                               (only nothing or tracer)
MARK_NOPROBE(eventname, "%d %s", myint, mystring);
"cannot use printk" (used in scheduler, NMIs, wakeup, printk itself)
                    (nothing, kprobe, jumpprobe or tracer)
MARK_NOPRINT(eventname, "%d %s", myint, mystring);
Using the following table to select the mechanism :
Config/probe declaration     |   normal      |    noprobe    |     noprint
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nothing                      |   nothing      |   nothing     |    nothing
kprobe                       |   kprobe       |   tracer      |    kprobe
jumpprobe                    |   jumpprobe    |   tracer      |    jumpprobe
printk                       |   printk       |   tracer      |    kprobe
tracer                       |   tracer       |   tracer      |    tracer
Therefore, selecting the "kprobe" configuration option would still let people
instrument the hardest paths while having mostly dynamic probes.
