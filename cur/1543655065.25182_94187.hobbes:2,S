Hi
I am using kdb 2.1 to hunt down a bug. This bug shows up after like 2 days
of uptime. Problem is that also on this system I get a unkown reason NMI
like:
Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 21.
Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
When it happens it enters kdb mode, thus the system "freezes".
Because I cannot be there to issue a "go" everytime it happens (line 4 am
:) ), it makes very hard to keep kdb enabled kernel running to wait for
the hunted bug to happen.
Is there a possibility to disable going to kdb mode when a "unkown reason"
NMI is received ? I could not find any usefull info in the kdb docs.
PS: this is the output from kdb on serial console when it receives the
NMI:
Entering kdb (current=0xcf142000, pid 31088) on processor 0 due to NonMaskable 3
eax = 0x00000051 ebx = 0x0804ebb0 ecx = 0x40017000 edx = 0x00000000
esi = 0x00000042 edi = 0x0804ebf8 esp = 0xbfffe094 eip = 0x08048fe3
ebp = 0xbfffe0ac xss = 0x0000002b xcs = 0x00000023 eflags = 0x00000202
xds = 0x0000002b xes = 0x0000002b origeax = 0x00000051 &regs = 0xcf143fc4
Thanks
