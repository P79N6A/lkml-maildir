Indeed, all files on which mmap was failing were located on noexec'd
devices (although for the cdrom the noexec is not explicitely stated in
my /etc/fstab file). Your patch fixes my problem, mmap on these devices
is working again. Thanks!
Now I'm only curious as to why the problem only affected me. Since it
looks like noexec is implied on cdrom devices, the problem should have
affected everyone. Or are the "!pt_gnu_stack binaries" something rare? I
admit I have no idea what it refers to.
Thanks again.
