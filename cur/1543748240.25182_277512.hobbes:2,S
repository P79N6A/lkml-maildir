This is basically what time sliced cfq does. For sync requests, cfq
allows a definable idle period where we give the process a chance to
submit a new request if it has enough time slice to do so. This
'anticipation' then is just an artifact of the design of time sliced
cfq, where we do assign a finite time period where a given process owns
the disk.
See my initial posting on time sliced cfq. That is why time sliced cfq
does as well (or better) then AS for the many client cases, while still
being fair.
