And what did eventfd do to you? :)
I partially agree with Roland (and I stated this during Casey's first 
post), this can be achieved in a not too troublesome way already.
A new dedicated interface is easier for the challenged userspace coder, 
but I dunno if it's worth the new code (although it does have little 
footprint). Both ways are fine from my POV.
