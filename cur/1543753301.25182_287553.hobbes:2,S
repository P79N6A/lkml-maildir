I must be in sleep :). I will fix it soon.

Firmware possibly will can't return a useful suspend state (Either
firmware doesn't define such device or evaluation failed), that's why I
return an int. I suppose pci_choose_state will do something:
	ret = firmware_pci_choose_state(dev, state);
	if (ret >= 0)
		pci_state = ret;
	switch(pci_state) {
	case 0: return PCI_D0;
	.....
	}
