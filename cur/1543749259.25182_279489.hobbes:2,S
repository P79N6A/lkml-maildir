Yeah, makes sense. I think we can consider multi_prio_tree_node
later if many future users of prio_tree code need vma->shared.vm_set
like handling.
I am okay with the patch. I haven't tested it myself and I won't
have time to do so for next few days. Below are some small nitpicks.

I wonder whether we should use [start, last] or [first, last] for
index names because "end" normally means last + 1, e.g., vm_end.
In prio_tree we store closed intervals of form [first, last] and
I think the name "last" makes it more explicit. Did I tell you
nitpicking ?

prio_tree_replace should be static in prio_tree.c.

Should we go with prio_tree_iter_init and remove prio_tree_first
(similar to vma_prio_tree_next) ? I am not very particular about it,
though.

Should be "inline" ?
Thanks,
