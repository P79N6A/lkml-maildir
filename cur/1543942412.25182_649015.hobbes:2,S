The Linux kernel is licenced under the GPLv2.
Ndiswrapper loads and executes code with not GPLv2 compatible licences 
in a way in the kernel that might be considered similar to a GPLv2'ed 
userspace program dlopen() a dynamic library file with a not GPLv2 
compatible licence.
IANAL, but I do think there might be real copyright issues with 
ndiswrapper.
