You should be able to get at least order 9, therefore 2 MB.
With kernel 2.6 you should also be able to get order 10, therefore 4 MB.
If you need more you have to puzzle the areas together.
The way wli suggested is better.
But if this is no possible just make it a requierement to load the
module while booting, then there are enough free areas.
