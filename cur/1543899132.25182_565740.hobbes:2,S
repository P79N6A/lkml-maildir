Subject: can entire drivers/acorn subdirectory be removed?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/6/133

  given that:
1) drivers/Makefile doesn't even have an entry for the acorn/
   subdirectory, and
2) the Makefile drivers/acorn/char/Makefile is incorrect anyway, since
   it contains:
    obj-$(CONFIG_L7200_KEYB)        += defkeymap-l7200.o keyb_l7200.o
   which refers to a non-existent source file keyb_l7200.c, and it's
based on a non-existent config variable on top of that.  it certainly
seems that that entire subdirectory can be tossed.
  and if that happens, then the config variables defined in
drivers/acorn/block/Kconfig:
  config BLK_DEV_FD1772
  config BLK_DEV_MFM
  config BLK_DEV_MFM_AUTODETECT
would also vanish, which suggests that any references to *them* could
also be deleted:
$ grep -r BLK_DEV_FD1772 *
arch/arm26/defconfig:# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD1772 is not set
arch/arm26/machine/dma.c:#if defined(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD1772) || defined(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD1772_MODULE)
arch/arm26/machine/dma.c:#if defined(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD1772) || defined(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD1772_MODULE)
...
  anyway, you get the idea.  thoughts?
