Hi there,
does anyone have a clue what can cause a hard reset with a Compaq ML570 Quad 
CPU System? If i use "maxcpus=2" the kernel boots fine and works fine, if i 
boot with "maxcpus=3" i see "Loading Linux..." and then hard reset, if i use 
maxcpus=4 the same, if i use "noapic" also the same.
I totally have no clue about it and also don't see any error messages, also 
not with early printk() patch from William Lee Irwin III.
This is with 2.4.18, 2.4.19rc1, 2.4.19rc1-aa2, 2.4.19-rc1-aa2-jam2 and my 
kernel tree wolk 3.5.
For anyone who don't know the mashine:
