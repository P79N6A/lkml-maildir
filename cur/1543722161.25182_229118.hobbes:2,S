It happens because I used 'clean-rule' in the package makefile.
The problem is that I need to delete files at the root of the kernel src tree,
and usually kbuild add the $(obj)/ prefix.
So when we visit package/ the clean-rule is not empty and get executed.
I will fix tomorrow. Just need to add a simple existence check 
before assigning 'clean-rule'.
