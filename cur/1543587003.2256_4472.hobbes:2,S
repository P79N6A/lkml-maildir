Use a hardware random number generator if you need a lot of entropy. 
The i810 RNG driver and userspace tools at
http://sourceforge.net/project/gkernel/
 provide an example for an
implementation, if your hardware is not i8xx.

No, because an attacker can potentially control input and make it
non-random.
