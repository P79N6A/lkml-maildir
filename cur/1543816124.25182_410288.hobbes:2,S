Here are some w1 patches that have been in the -mm tree for a long time.
They move some files into different locations, add a new driver, and fix
some bugs.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/w1-2.6.git/
or from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/w1-2.6.git/
if it isn't synced up yet.
The full patch series will sent to the linux-kernel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
