Hi.  I built 2.3.25 yesterday to try on my long-suffering 2xPIII box,
and saw a lot of IDE hangs, IRQ timeouts, and ATAPI resets on my CD
writer while using it to play an audio CD.  The lost interrupts cause
various parts of my GUI to hang until the timeout/reset occurs.
There's a bunch of stuff in the box:
* Intel N440BX dual mobo, 2xPIII, 256MB
* 2xIDE-HD on piix-ide0 master/slave
* 2xIDE-CDROM on piix-ide1 (writer on master, reader on slave)
  -- using ide-scsi driver
* 1xZIP drive on PnP SoundBlaster IDE channel
* 1x9.1GB SCSI disk on mobo ncr53c8xx channel 0
All the hardware works fairly well with 2.3.25 -- I haven't seen any
oopses, data corruption, or other Bad Things, but I get temporary
hangs when/while gtcd is checking for disks in the drive, or playing a
disk.
The same hardware & software (RH6.1 base) works tolerably with 2.2.13
(similar kernel configuration, same software).
If this is a problem that somebody would like to look at, but can't
reproduce reliably, I'd be happy to provide more info or test
patches.
regards,
d.
