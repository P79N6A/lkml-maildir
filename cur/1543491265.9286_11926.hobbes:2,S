Hi,
	I am facing a rather unusual problem of file table overflow. I
always thought (wrongly ofcourse) that a "Too Many Files Open" error would
popup before a file table overflow.
	Could you tell me why such a problem could occur. This problem
occurs rather randomly, can I reproduce this problem deterministically.
I am using a Linux Box with a lot of load. I have a 486 with 16MB RAM
(yeah! I got it long long ago).
Thanks in advance.
Balbir Singh.
PS: I am not on the list, so please reply personally to me.
