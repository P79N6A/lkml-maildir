Subject: (Slightly offtopic) NEED HELP, bootloader on SCO system died and only have Linux to help rescue the system

I am trying to rescue a currently dead SCO 5.0.4 Openserver system who's
boot loader keeps dying at stage 1.  I have tried to mount the SCO partition
but the sysv filesystem doesn't recognize the parition.  Am I using the
right filesystem?  If not do we have a filesystem driver for SCO
filesystems?  Can I use lilo to boot the SCO system somehow?  I also have an
SCO 5.0.2 installation boot floppy (no installation CDROM though), but I do
not think that can be of any help.  From my various pokes at the dead system
it appears that the disk geometry has been screwed up in the master boot
record.  I think I may be able to repair it if only I could run dparam (from
SCO) on it again, but first I need to get the system back up, maybe lilo can
help?
