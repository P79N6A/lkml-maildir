But your patch isn't a fix.  It is a hack to make the system boot.
A patch that performed the same check on the efi memory map,
or it converted the efi memory map to use an e820 map it would be a fix.

My point is that the kernel efi support is broken.  You have just found
the location where the bone is poking through the skin.
I am tempted to write a patch to delete the x86 efi support at this
point.  So that it is very clear that it needs to be completely redone.
