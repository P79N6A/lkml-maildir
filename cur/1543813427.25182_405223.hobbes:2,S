I did something similar a while back which I called split active lists.
I think it is a good idea in general and I did see fairly large speedups
with heavy swapping kbuilds, but nobody else seemed to want it :P
So you split the inactive list as well - that's going to be a bit of
change in behaviour and I'm not sure whether you gain anything.
I don't think PageMapped is a very good name for the flag.
I test mapped lazily. Much better way to go IMO.
I had further patches that got rid of reclaim_mapped completely while
I was there. It is based on crazy metrics that basically completely
change meaning if there are changes in the memory configuration of
the system, or small changes in reclaim algorithms.
