There are now three cases that end up with the same message and
same error from userspace viewpoint. There are many cases where 
debugging a problem is helped when it's possible to find out exactly
which test determined that the filesystem could not be mounted. 
How about: 
	[ ... ]	{
	errstr = "no magic";
	goto cantfind_ext3;
	}
