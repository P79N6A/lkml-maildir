I may be wrong, I think it was Arjan persuaded AndrewG to allow the
acpitable.c code into 2.5 for this case.  At present it's enabled by
config option instead of boot option, in both 2.5 (where the config
option didn't actually work, patch posted for that a couple of days ago)
and in 2.4.22-pre (which thus diverges from 2.4.21).  That surprises me,
but I'd definitely defer to Arjan's preference.

I agree with you.

It did have some point before, recent changes have rendered it pointless,
and even if those changes get revised, there'll be a better way than the
confusing "acpismp=force".

Yes, though wouldn't BIOS be able to disable it on those too?

I fathered "noht", so feel some responsibility for it.  In its present
state it's simply buggered in both 2.5 and 2.4.22-pre, and I'd much rather
kill it off than leave it around in that misery.  If we can always switch
off in BIOS instead, I guess it's redundant and should go.  Arjan remarked
that it's no problem to honor it codewise in 2.4: up to 2.4.21 it was easy,
but now beyond what I can safely mess with - I'm hoping someone (perhaps
beginning with A?) might reprieve it, but if not I'll send patches to
remove it from 2.4 and 2.5 in a few weeks time.
