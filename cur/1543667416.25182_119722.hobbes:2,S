Almost all of the people I know who are running Linux are compiling their
own kernels fetched from kernel.org and very few of them are tracking
LKML, so even if they should, they aren't.
Would it really hurt that much to release 2.4.21 with the ptracefix(es)?
If it hurts that much, can kernel.org put out a brief message and a link
to the relevant patches somewhere so that people who doesn't follow LKML
can find the patches without browsing the ML-archives?
