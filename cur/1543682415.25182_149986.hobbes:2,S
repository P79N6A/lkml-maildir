I don't know. The message containing the patches doesn't seem to have made it
into either the LKML or the linux-fsdevel mailing lists.
The basic code can be found in:
	
http://cvs.infradead.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/afs/
In directories:
	Documentations/filesystems/
	include/linux/
	fs/cachefs/
I'll see about putting the patch up for download when I get to OLS.
