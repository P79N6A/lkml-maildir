Hi! 
 Stop being arrogant.
 Can you please elaborate on how to make Linux kernel support e.g. motion 
controllers? They do not fit *any* known to me driver interface. They have 
several axes, they have about twenty parameters (float or integer), and they 
have several commands, a-la start, graceful stop, abrupt stop. Plus 
obviously diagnostics - about ten another commands with absolutely different 
parameters. And about ten motion monitoring commands. And this is one 
example I were need to program. 
 Or take any other freaky device we might got on market tomorrow. 
 As ioctl() opponent, be kind and give some advice what to do in that kind 
of situations.
