it means you run a root program which requested the network card to go into
promic mode. promisc mode means, the card will receive all packets on the
wire, not only those destinated to the card. a few sniffing/scan
detector/accounting apps require this, and some legal apps for network
configuration (like dhcp/bootp/... ) and arpwatch may require it.
