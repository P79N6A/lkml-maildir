You just won't get support for it on Sparc, nor any other
platform that does not have the B4000000 macro defined.
Ie.
#ifdef B4000000
		case B4000000:
			....
#endif
If, some day, I figure out a clever way to encode these higher
speeds on Sparc and other platforms figure out how to do so as
well, we can remove the ifdef.
For now, the ifdef allows the thing to build properly on all
platforms.
