Well, the positive side is kexec
does work on  macbook pro
(doesn't play so well with the xserver,
garbled screen.).
As for the FADT table, I reverted to an old
.config that has no new options in it, and sure enough
that message appeared. Looking back in my logs,
the last kernel commit I have is:
 2.6.28-07485-g9e42d0c
that doesn't show such messages.
When examining this message
(not too familiar with FADT)
I see PM leading me to believe this maybe has to
do with the PM stuff.
(making me wonder, if this is the reason
suspend isn't working.just a black screen
upon wakeup); but like I said I'm not
familiar with that area.
heres what I see:

My main concern is making sure
the machine is going to be O.K.
when in this state, or should I revert
to a stable kernel(2.6.28) until things get
worked out?
