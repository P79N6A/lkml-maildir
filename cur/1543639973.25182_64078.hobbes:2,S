Kernel 2.4.19:
I was being plagued by the smp_num_cpus undeclared problems that seems
be circulating since the 2.3 days.  I appear to have triggered it by
turning SMP on, doing a full build, and then turning it off.  No
combination of make clean/dep/etc fixes it.  Finally, in desperation, I
tried:
        cp .config ~/config.bak
        make mrproper
        cp ~/config.bak .config
        make
And that fixed it.  Surprising.  Has anyone looked into what file
isn't being properly cleaned?  Given the LKML traffic that this
problem has generated, this should probably be fixed.
Thanks,
    - Scott
