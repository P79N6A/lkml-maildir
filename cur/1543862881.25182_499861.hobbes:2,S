Anything except a default value of 100% will change the behavior
and probably reduce the performance on most systems.

This is broken.
You have allocated a binary number for use with sys_sysctl but
did not test it.
If you need a special proc_handler to take action when the
value is changed you need a special strategy routine.
So since you aren't going to test the binary interface and don't
care about it please don't allocate a number for it and just
use CTL_UNNUMBERED.
And of course please read the top of linux/sysctl.h
Thank you.
