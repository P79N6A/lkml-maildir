Hallo,
I was trying to make "modularized kernel" (s.c. "Debian way") recently, yes,
I made even kernel.deb package - but at the installation, I'm still getting
an error: "ide-core: unresolved symbols".
Making a quick search with Google I could see, it did occur to many other
people even long ago. There was even a patch introduced - which, I believe,
is in the 2.4.34.4 "drivers/ide" sub-dir - unfortunately it seems, that the
patch is working no more.
Perhaps there is another patch available for 2.4.34.4 ?
