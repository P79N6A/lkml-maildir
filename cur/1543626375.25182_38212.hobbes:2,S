Ah, I see the bug.  I was looking at ffz (which is correct),
not ffs (which isn't).

The problem is                    ^^^
That sez any of register, memory, or immediate is ok.
It should be "r" instead, just like in ffz.
That said, we should probably be using __builtin_ffs
instead.  The compiler knows how to do bsfl plus the
adjustment.  Plus, it knows how to evaluate it at
compile-time for constants.
