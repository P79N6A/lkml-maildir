Firstly, its ARM only.  Secondly, Compaq decided that a partition table in
flash isn't a good idea, so they're passing it from the boot loader, which
is a set of tagged lists.
Unfortunately, they haven't even sent me a patch to add the entries into
the ARM tree, so even I have to reverse this from my MTD update. ;(
