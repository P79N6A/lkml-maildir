The fact that (unsigned long)-1 and ~0U have different 
values on different arches isn't a problem.
What would be a problem is if (unsigned long)-1 were liable
to be given different values by different compilers, and
especially if (unsigned long)-1 were liable to be cast to
some number between 0 and 15.  But I assume that the type
casting rules of C prohibit this---that (unsigned long)-1
is assured to be some very large positive integer.  (Indeed,
the largest.)  However I'm uncertain enough about this
assumption that I raise the present question about it.
Assuming that the assumption is correct [:)], the patch is fine
as it is and should go in.
BTW what problem is it you are having with PnP BIOS on your arch?
Can you refer me to a past thread title?
