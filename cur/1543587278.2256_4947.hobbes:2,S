Hi there,
We have talked about assymmetric multiprocessor configurations once or
twice around.  The easy way to deal with them is simply to use
"no-tsc" on the command line (and/or compile your kernel
appropriately.)  One could, at least theoretically, make them usable
in kernel space only (in user space there is no hope, since you can't
know which CPU's TSC you're reading), but these machines seem to be so
rare that hardly anyone technical enough to fix it cares.
