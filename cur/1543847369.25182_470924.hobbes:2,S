What churn at bootup ? The clocksources _can_ be switched and it does
not matter, when this is done. We had the trouble with the early
registration a couple of month ago, and there is no reason to
reintroduce it. On systems which have exactly one clocksource, you can
register them early in bootup, but please do not touch the x86 setup for
no good reason.
