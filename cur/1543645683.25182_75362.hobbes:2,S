It's similar, but not the same.  If you simply have too many
processes running at the same time we could fix the problem
with load control, reducing the number of running processes
until stuff fits in RAM.
With one process that needs 150% of RAM as its working set,
there simply is no way to win.

If there is no competition I agree.  However, if the system has
something else running at the same time as qsbench I think the
system should make an effort to have _only_ qsbench thrashing
and not every other process in the system as well.

But, should just the gimp thrash, or should every process on the
machine thrash ?

This will help a lot in fine-tuning the VM.  I should do some more
procps work and extend vmstat to understand all the knew VM statistics
being exported in /proc...
