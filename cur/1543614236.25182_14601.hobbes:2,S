You did not read my mail all the way through, did you?  I said -
If the [user space] code cannot open /proc/dynamic_syscalls or cannot
find the desired syscall name, fall back to the assigned syscall number
(if any) or fail if there is no assigned syscall number.  By falling
back to the assigned syscall number, new versions of the user space
code are backwards compatible, on older kernels it will use the dynamic
syscall number, on newer kernels it will use the assigned number.
