It's a waste of course. But it won't greatly reduce the performance as
quoted above. It won't work bad.
It will be some unit slower as the whole kernel will be due locking
overhead, not necessary checks and so on. But it won't be greatly
slowwwer. You won't see the slowdown with your eyes at least.
