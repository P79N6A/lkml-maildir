Indeed. See linux/include/linux/tasks.h. You may configure NR_TASKS
(total number of processes), MAX_TASKS_PER_USER (maximum number of tasks
for one user) and MIN_TASKS_LEFT_FOR_ROOT (only root may use these
ones).
The upper limit for MAX_TASKS_PER_USER on i386 is 4092 (4090 if you
compiled APM support).
