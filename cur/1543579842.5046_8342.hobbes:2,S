Subject: eepro100 problems with embedded Intel PRO/100 VM NIC

The eepro100 driver appears to have timeout problems with the
Intel PRO/100 VM network card. I have such a card embedded in
my work machine.
The NIC has a 82562-equivalent controller chip. 
The eepro100 driver does correctly initialize the network card and
network traffic does work for a time until I start receiving the
following messages:
Jan 24 14:53:08 morpheus kernel: eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!
Jan 24 14:53:42 morpheus last message repeated 12 times
Jan 24 14:53:53 morpheus last message repeated 5 times
Jan 24 14:53:55 morpheus kernel: mtrr: 0x44000000,0x2000000 overlaps
existing 0x44000000,0x400000
Jan 24 14:54:29 morpheus kernel: eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!
Jan 24 14:54:46 morpheus last message repeated 7 times
/proc/pci reports the NIC as such:
  Bus  2, device   8, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Intel Unknown device (rev 1).
      Vendor id=8086. Device id=2449.
      Medium devsel.  Fast back-to-back capable.  IRQ 10.  Master
Capable.  Late
ncy=66.  Min Gnt=8.Max Lat=56.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x40100000 [0x40100000].
      I/O at 0x1400 [0x1401].
What is strange is the mtrr error. I do run X with /dev/agpgart without
any problems, but network will stop working after a while.
Intel had released the drivers for the Intel PRO/100 VM card for 2.2
series kernel, but I would really rather run 2.4 to take adcvantage of
all the new hardware support.
If you need more information or wish to reply back, please reply to my
e-mail address rather than the list.
Thanks!
Tom
