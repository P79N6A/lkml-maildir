Thanks, I'll look into it.

I did before, but I read on Harald Weltes' weblog that 2.4 gives
slightly worse pps results than 2.6, and since the cpu usage is as high
as it is, I didn't want to take any more performance hits.
I'll try to see what performance impact the netfilter rules have during
peak load.

256. I increased them to 1024 shortly after the profiling run, but
didn't notice any change in the cpu usage (will try again with cyclesoak).

Thanks, I'll give it a spin.
