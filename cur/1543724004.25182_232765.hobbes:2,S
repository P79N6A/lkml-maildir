As Andrew pointed out back then, page->mapping can go to null, but even
if we have a stale copy of page->mapping, the mapping can't be freed. 
So you're right that it should be enough to keep the change to cache the
value of mapping.  
I was hunting the backing dev info bugs back then, and seem to have
talked myself into the barriers while testing...
