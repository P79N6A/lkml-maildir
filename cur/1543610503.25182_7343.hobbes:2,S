I got into a long argument with someone from Redhat, who suggested that I
read too many ./ postings, and gained my opinion of gcc 2.96 as shipped in
7.0 from that.
Where my opinion of it was formed by running it on my laptop for T&E for
two weeks, and having about a 25% success ratio of compiling code under
it. Well, okay ... 50% for compilation, and of that, 50% running without
catching on fire.
In that conversation, he assured me that RH would take every measure to
ensure that future releases were compatible with code generated under
2.96.
So, it could be amusing ...
