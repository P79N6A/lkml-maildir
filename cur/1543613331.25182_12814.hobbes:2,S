I believe you. Nevertheless, it appears to be a problem that happens in
the LAST-ACK state.

I'll do that if it happens again.

I'm afraid it did end there. :( The data transfer was unidirectional
from the remote towards the Linux machine. During the SYN exchange the
RTT is less than one second. The rest is queuing delay. So Linux should
have a fairly low RTO. There were no FIN retransmissions, I'm sorry to
say.
