Currently you place the voyager information in the APM table,  which is problematic
for the goal of being able to have a kernel that will support everything,
and it is a little confusing.  There is still plenty of room for the voyager table,
elsewhere so I don't think that is needed.
Please check out include/asm-i386/boot_param.h for an enumeration of where
we actually put the variables.  Since it hasn't made it into the kernel
yet either get out of the linux-kernel mailing list or at:
ftp://download.lnxi.com/pub/src/linux-kernel-patches/boot/linux-2.5.8.boot.diff
