Just a quick follow-up. On regular bootups, I get this message:
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xf8850100 ctl 0x00000000 bmdma 0x00000000 irq 218
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0xf8850180 ctl 0x00000000 bmdma 0x00000000 irq 218
while the nosmp one gets this (the screenshot cut the irq part):
ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m2048@0x9b304000 port 0x9b304100 irq 223
ata2: SATA max UDMA/133 abar m2048@0x9b304000 port 0x9b304100 irq 223
Don't know if the irq # change is significant or not. Will try noapic now.
