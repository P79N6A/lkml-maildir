System times are little higher (multipliers are set at busy = 10,
idle = 10) .... I'll try setting the idle multipler to 100, but
the other thing to do would be into increase the cross-node migrate
resistance by setting some minimum imbalance offsets. That'll 
probably have to be node-specific ... something like the number
of cpus per node ... but probably 0 for the simple HT systems.
