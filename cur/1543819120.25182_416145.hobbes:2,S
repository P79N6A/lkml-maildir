There are two limits though, the component length limit (NAME_MAX),
and the overall length limit (PATH_MAX).  For example:
$ mkdir -p `perl -e 'print "A"x255'`/`perl -e 'print "B"x255'`/`perl -e 'print "C"x255'`/`perl -e 'print "D"x255'`
works fine here.
However, with 256 I get "File name too long", as you did.
