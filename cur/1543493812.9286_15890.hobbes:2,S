Ok, seing this, I have a question. I have a pair of Cheetah 9Gb wide
drives, both running of of a Symbios scsi/ethernet card (875 IIRC). One
drive shows up with 1106 cylinders and the other shows the 8K+ number of
cylinders. At first I thought it must have been a side effect of a
failed NT install attempts. After low-level formatting, nothing changed. 
What would cause this, and is it something I should be concerned about?
