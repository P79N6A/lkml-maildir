Yeah, I guess so.  My mental filter was actually more like "how to do linux 
development", and it seemed both short and easy to translate, and also 
generally relevant to the majority of developers no matter what subsystem 
they're working on.
But I agree, it's not policy.

That one's not policy either, but it is general non-subsystem-specific 
development.  Probably "applying-patches.txt" above goes in the same bucket.
Whether or not to include that bucket in the new directory depends on whether 
the directory is labeled "development" or "policy" or something else...

The problem is, the generated htmdocs are in english.  This file is about how 
to generate (and author) English documentation that won't be translated.  
What's the point of translating the instructions if the result won't be 
translated?
On the other hand, if the authors of patches _do_ put javadoc comments into 
the source code, the language maintainer should be aware of them and should 
have some easy way to translate them for the list...

Extracting the policy out into separate documents I could see, but I agree 
those are primarily technical.
