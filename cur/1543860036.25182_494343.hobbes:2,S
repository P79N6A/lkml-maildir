Call me paranoid, but I'd like to leave it this way for for a while yet
to shake out bugs.  There are some complicated interactions here, some
of which are hardware-specific, and we've only just started to really
shake out the associated problems.  (But yes, eventually we do want to
see that option go away, and this behavior be standard with PM enabled.)

Hey, that's great to know.  Thanks for sharing the figures!
And special thanks to Alan, for reworking (and re-reworking) relevant
parts of usbcore so that these power savings can (mostly) be automated.
ISTR the first patches supporting USB suspend/resume/wakeup landed in
about the 2.6.10 kernel, and things look a LOT better than back then.
