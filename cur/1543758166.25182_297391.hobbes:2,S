The solution to your problem (which is as old as the hills) involves
priority inheriting mutexes which are available in the RT preempt patch
(if you build with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT).  This should be usable for hard
realtime applications.

If you just need very good soft realtime performance I recommend
PREEMPT_DESKTOP.
