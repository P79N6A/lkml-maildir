My Dell 300XT CPi laptop still does this most times (not always) but
 specifying append="hdc=cdrom" in lilo.conf results in a boot message
 like this
 hdc: ATAPI CDROM (?)
 and the drive actually works 100% cases. I don't recall 2.3.12 ever
 going wrong, though surely about 2.3.5 it was the same. Not 2.2.10
 alone, it would seem.
