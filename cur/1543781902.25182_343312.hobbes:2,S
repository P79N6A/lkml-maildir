OK, it'll be this:
		case NOT_READY:
			/*
			 * If the device is in the process of becoming ready,
			 * retry.
			 */
			if (sshdr.asc == 0x04 && sshdr.ascq == 0x01) {
				scsi_requeue_command(q, cmd);
				return;
			}
			printk(KERN_INFO "Device %s not ready.\n",
			       req->rq_disk ? req->rq_disk->disk_name : "");
Where the disk name is evaluating to an empty string.
Maybe you could stick a dump_stack() in there, get some additional info.
Anyway, over to you, James ;)
