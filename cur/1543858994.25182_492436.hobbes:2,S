By saying that there shouldn't be any dirty ptes if there are no
dirty buffers? But in that case the _page_ shouldn't be dirty either,
so that clear_page_dirty would be redundant. But presumably it isn't.

Yes I could believe it the corruption is caused by something else
completely.

After try_to_free_buffers detaches the buffers from the page, a
pagefault can come in, and mark the pte writeable, then set_page_dirty
(which finds no buffers, so only sets PG_dirty).
The page can now get dirtied through this mapping.
try_to_free_buffers then goes on to clean the page and ptes.
I really thought you were the one who identified this race, and I didn't
see where you showed it is safe.
It may be very unlikely with small SMPs, but less so with preempt. All
we have to do is preempt at spin_unlock in try_to_free_buffers AFAIKS.
Were you testing with preempt?
