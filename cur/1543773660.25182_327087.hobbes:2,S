Yeah, you probably really want to do something like:
	static const char p[] = { '-', '\\', '|', '/' };
	printk("Freeing memory...  ");
	while ((tmp = shrink_all_memory(10000))) {
		pages += tmp;
		printk("\b%c", p[i++ % sizeof(p)]);
	}
By using {} instead of "" to declare the char array you avoid placing the
unneeded '\0' terminator on the string.  Plus it definately should be
declared "static".  I don't see any advantage here of keeping "i" explicitly
in range instead of just doing the "i & 3" on each array lookup; it's one
and per loop either way.
