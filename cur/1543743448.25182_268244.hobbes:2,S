The idea of the patch is correct.
The UML part should be mergeable immediately - however, I don't know if that 
could be a security risk or has any bug (any place still using the old size).
Also, I'd like to understand what arch/um/kernel/user_util.c wants to do near 
its beginning!
For the arch-independent code, there needs to be something like a Kconfig 
entry (not necessarily a user-question, see CONFIG_GENERIC_RWSEM for 
instance).
Also, I'd like to cross-check this patch with the one used by Knoppix for ages 
to do the same thing.
Bye
