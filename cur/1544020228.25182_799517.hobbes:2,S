drivers/staging/panel/Kconfig: config PANEL
vs. include/video/mach64.h: #define CONFIG_PANEL	0x00
When staging's CONFIG_PANEL=y (is enabled), the mach64.h header file gets
lots of these:
include/video/mach64.h:1257:1: warning: "CONFIG_PANEL" redefined
so staging adds a new config symbol that conflicts with the
(incorrect namespace) usage in mach64.h.
mach64 needs to change IMO, even though it is older.
