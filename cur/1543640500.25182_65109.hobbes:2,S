That and then each time a SIGCHILD is sent, it is also sent
to the tracer, if there is one.  Some filtering may be
needed here as the real parent should not be disturbed by
trace ONLY things.  It has been done on other systems.  Not
super clean, but it does push Heisenberg out a ring or two. 
The current way its done, a child can not get the pid of its
father and thus would NEED to know it was being traced in
order to do anything that required such.  This is asking
Heisenberg to live somewhere more or less close by :)
