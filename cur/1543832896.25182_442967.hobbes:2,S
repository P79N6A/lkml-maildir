If we do a GFP_KERNEL allocation with this semaphore held, and the
oom-killer tries to kill something to satisfy the allocation, and the
killed task gets stuck on that semaphore, I wonder of the box locks up.
Probably it'll work out OK if the semaphore is taken after that task has
had some resources torn down.
