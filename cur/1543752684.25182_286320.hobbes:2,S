Possibly. On the other hand, I can well imagine that the list of
subscribers is different for the two cases. The same way I refuse to have
anything to do with vendor-sec, maybe somebody else refuses to honor even
a five-day rule, but would want to be on the "no rules, but let's be clear
that we're all good guys, not gray or black-hats.
Also, especially with a hard rule, there's just less confusion, I think, 
if the two are separate. Otherwise you'd have to have strict Subject: line 
rules or something - which basically means that they are separate lists 
anyway.
But hey, it's not even clear that both are needed. With a short enough 
disclosure requirement, maybe people feel like the "five-day rule, 
possible explicitly _relaxed_ by the original submitter" is sufficient.
