I'm puzzled by the following part (can be a misunderstanding from my side)
+config CPUISOL_STOPMACHINE
+       bool "Do not halt isolated CPUs with Stop Machine (EXPERIMENTAL)"
+       depends on CPUISOL && STOP_MACHINE && EXPERIMENTAL
+       help
+         If this option is enabled kernel will not halt isolated CPUs
+         when Stop Machine is triggered. Stop Machine is currently only
+         used by the module insertion and removal.
this "only" part. What about e.g. a 'cpu hotplug' case (_cpu_down())?
(or we should abstract it a bit to the point that e.g. a cpu can be
considered as 'a module'? :-)
