Even if he doesn't act on the listing of prior art, it would
be a nice indicator to the laywer and company in question that
we have a large stack of prior art evidence that will be handed
to the first party they try to sue over the patent.
Ie: if you start sueing, you're sure to lose the patent. So
please be careful.
Ted's idea of a www.priorart.org would be great too. It
shouldn't be too much trouble to host such a site somewhere
outside of the US (or with the required disclaimers).

Rik
