It's not uncommon on Solaris:  hacked machines usually have a "psmod"
module loaded which prevents certain processes from being visible in
/proc, and hence in ps.
I have to agree with Frank on this one, because you can never have 100%
certainty of keeping undesirables out --- so it makes sense to devote
effort to detection (and countermeasures against anti-detection
mechanisms) as well as on keeping them out in the first place.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
