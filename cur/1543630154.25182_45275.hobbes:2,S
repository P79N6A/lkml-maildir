O_DIRECT is especially useful for applications which maintain their
own cache, e.g. a database.  And adding Async to it is an even bigger
bonus (another Oracleism we did in PTX).  No read ahead, no attempt
to keep the buffer in memory until memory pressure kicks in.  Just
a good tool for doing random IO (like an OLTP database would do).
