Hi friends,
Have been working on a simple kernel module, I've made everything built 
with kbuild and insmod test.ko. Now it seems that the module has been 
installed, however, it doesn't seem to work correctly. I get this dmesg:
kernel: test: no version for "struct_module" found: kernel tainted.
Experts here - what is struct_module and how to make modules give proper 
version for it?
TIA
