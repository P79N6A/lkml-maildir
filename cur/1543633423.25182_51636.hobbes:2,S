So what?  Users want filenames with ',' in them, the build system
should cope with it.  Restricting what the user is allowed to do to
what the build system can handle is the wrong approach.  The build
system already has to replace '-' with '_', changing comma as well is
not a problem.  Or are you going to say that '-' is not allowed in
filenames either?

Not in kbuild 2.5.  I handle this case correctly for the -MD dependency
filename.  Try it and see.
KBUILD_BASENAME and KBUILD_OBJECTNAME could suffer from name
collisions.  BASENAME is only used inside objects so duplicate
basenames are not a problem.
OBJECTNAME is externally visible, it is used in Rusty's rationalization
of boot and module parameters.  The only time that OBJECTNAME collision
would be a problem is when there are two modules called foo,bar and
foo_bar.  Having two modules that differ by a single character in the
middle of the name is going to cause more problems than just option
collision.  BTW, the existing build system does not support
KBUILD_OBJECTNAME so Rusty's code cannot go in.

That would be worth changing, it is just a textual change with no
effect on the code.
