Ok, but keep in mind that this starvation occurs even in the absence of 
fsync, as the benchmarks show.
And, a quick test of successive 1sec delayed syncs shows no hangs until about 
1 minute (~180mb) of db-writeout activity, when the sync abruptly hangs for 
minutes on end, and io-wait shows almost 100%.
Now it turns out that 'echo 3 > /proc/.../drop_caches' has no effect, but 
doing it a few more times makes the hangs go away for while, only to come 
back again and again.
Thanks!
