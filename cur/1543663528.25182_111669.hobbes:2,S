I suppose we could.  Or maybe we should just get to the root of the
thing and make a generic acpi_resource_address structure and never
even expose the 16, 32, and 64 bit variants.  As far as I can tell,
they just make life difficult for consumers.
Then acpi_rs_address16_resource(), acpi_rs_address32_resource(),
and acpi_rs_address64_resource() could be collapsed into one function
with pretty trivial checks for the different sizes.  And there's lots
of similar collapsing that could be done.  I bet we'd even find one
or two defects in the process of removing all the duplicated code.
Of course, I guess that would change the CA interface, so that
constrains things a bit.
