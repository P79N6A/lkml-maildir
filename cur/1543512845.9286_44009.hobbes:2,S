Not sure what you're trying to say here. Devfs does this by accessing
a structure member. So there are no searches required. So it's true to
say that devfs doesn't have an index operation. That's because it
doesn't have a major array in the first place.

I agree. My point is just that devfs gives you the option of avoiding
this new overhead. Obviously, the current major table has to be
replaced.
