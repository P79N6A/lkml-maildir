Hi Alan,
just a quick note to tell you that with ATA_ENABLE_PATA my
system works fine and does even survive suspend-to-ram.
This is a Samsung P35 laptop with one builtin 80 GB harddisk
and one builtin DVD-RAM drive.
libata patches are the ones included in 2.6.17-rc1-mm2 with
an additional one-liner:
