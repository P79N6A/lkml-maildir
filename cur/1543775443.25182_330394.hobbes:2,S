Going to per-disk queues is undoubtedly a good idea, performance will be
much better this way. So far, so good.
But you need to do something about the queueing for this to be
acceptable, imho. You have a per-controller queueing limit in place, you
need to enforce some fairness to ensure an equal distribution of
commands between the disks.
Perhaps just limit the per-queue depth to something sane, instead of the
huuuge 384 commands you have now. I've had several people complain to
me, that ciss is doing some nasty starvation with that many commands in
flight and we've effectively had to limit the queueing depth to
something really low to get adequate read performance in presence of
writes.
