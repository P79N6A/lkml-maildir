OT, but something that's been bugging me for quite a while.
I cut and paste the patch from the email to a file ktimers.patch.
"# patch -l -p1 <ktimer.patch" and it returns ---
  (Patch is indented 1 space.)
patching file fs/exec.c
patch: **** malformed patch at line 16: }
If I prepend 2 tabs to the line, it complains about line 17, I do the 
same to line 17 and on it moves to the next. from the manpage it reads 
like the "-l" should take care of the tabs so it only compares the text.
Can anyone suggest how to apply the patch? Googling didn't help.
Regards
Sid.
