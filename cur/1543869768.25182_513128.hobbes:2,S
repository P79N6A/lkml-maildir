Meanwhile on practiceal side:
via epia kevent/epoll/threadlet:
client: ab -c500 -n5000 $url
kevent:		849.72
epoll:		538.16
threadlet:
 gcc ./evserver_epoll_threadlet.c -o ./evserver_epoll_threadlet
 In file included from ./evserver_epoll_threadlet.c:30:
 ./threadlet.h: In function ‘threadlet_exec’:
 ./threadlet.h:46: error: can't find a register in class ‘GENERAL_REGS’
 while reloading ‘asm’
That particular asm optimization fails to compile.
