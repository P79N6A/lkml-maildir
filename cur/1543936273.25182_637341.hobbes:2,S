Yes, this the primary decision point, everything after this depends on

Agreed.  It all depends on the situation, we have kernel drivers for
devices that can be done in userspace, but not as cleanly or nicely, and
so, they stay as kernel drivers.
In the end, it comes down to individual cases, so let's handle them at
that level, it's easier that way.
