The sensors might just need some board-specific configuration. May I ask
which motherboard this is?
I may help you (in private) setup your sensors. If you're interested,
send the output of "sensors-detect" and "sensors" to me and I'll
see what can be done to improve the reported values.
Two more random thoughts:
Any reason why you run 2.6.15 rather than 2.6.15.4? That's where I would
start if I was suspecting a kernel bug.
Did you already update the BIOS to the latest version available? There
are a few kernel complaints in your dmesg which might be solved by a
newer BIOS (and/or parameter changes in the BIOS setup).
