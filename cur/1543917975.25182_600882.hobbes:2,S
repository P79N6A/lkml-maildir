Basically, anything that maps to a simple mutex. Anything more complex
gets real messy real quick.
Locks that have non-exclusive states become non-deterministic because an
unbounded number of contexts can be in this state. Hence acquisition of
the exclusive state has unbounded time. Even when limited to a bounded
number, the ramifications to the PI graph will get you a head-ache.
Also, non-owner locks, ie. semaphores (asymetric acquisition vs release
contexts) are unusable because the lack of ownership undermines PI - who
to boost?
