One such stuck process had the following backtrace:
#0  schedule_timeout (timeout=-150765944) at timer.c:864
#1  0xc01a28a3 in uart_wait_until_sent (tty=0xf7669000, timeout=2147483647)

This doesn't appear to be serial-specific. Another stuck process is:
(gdb) bt
#0  schedule_timeout (timeout=2147483647) at timer.c:836
#1  0xc01af23d in read_chan (tty=0xf73da000, file=0xf781f6a0, 
    buf=0xbffffd93 "", nr=1) at n_tty.c:1043
#2  0xc01aa4b6 in tty_read (file=0xf781f6a0, buf=0xbffffd93 "", count=1, 
    ppos=0xf781f6c0) at tty_io.c:677
#3  0xc0142e2c in vfs_read (file=0xf781f6a0, buf=0xbffffd93 "", count=1, 
    pos=0xf781f6c0) at read_write.c:193
#4  0xc0142ffe in sys_read (fd=0, buf=0xbffffd93 "", count=1)
    at read_write.c:232
#5  0xc01078df in syscall_call () at process.c:982
It's actually possible to kick these by sending them signal-generating
characters, though the forward progress one can make this way is limited.
(1) type "ls &"
(2) This will not echo.
(3) type ^Z (^C doesn't work for some reason)
(4) "ls &" echoes
(5) no prompt appears
(6) type ^Z again
(7) the prompt doesn't appear
(8) type ^Z again
(9) the prompt appears
... this is a little oversimplified. Some pounding on the return keys is
usually also required. serial and non-serial behave identically here.
Cheers,
Bill
