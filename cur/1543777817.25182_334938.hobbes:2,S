Is this the reason why you initialize members of static structs? If this is 
uninitialized it will end in the bss section and will be zeroed before the 
kernel uses is. If you do it will go into data section and add more bloat to 
the binary. At least this is the explanation I got once why not to do this.
Many of the callers of pci_find_device() look like they are not ported to the 
2.6 driver API and do the scanning for devices themself. I think it would be 
a good idea to try to convert them to the new driver model instead of 
replacing this. When you mark this deprecated and they still use the old 
function everyone using this will see that there is some work to do.

If you try to beautify code then please use for_each_pci_dev() macro from 
include/linux/pci.h where possible.
When you want something of this getting included you have to split that into 
pieces. Use extra patches for changes in coding style and functionality.
>* Marks the function as deprecated in pci.h
This is a very good idea in my eyes.
