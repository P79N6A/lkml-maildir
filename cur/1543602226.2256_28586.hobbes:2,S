I'm composing a list of all existing binary only modules, 
and I got to a list of 26 different modules
... 
Hewlet Packard	- High level security modules (LSM) 
SGI		- High level security modules (LSM) 
Wirex		- High level security modules (LSM)
NOTE: To my knowledge, the above mentioned modules either do not exist 
or have not been released. The LSM patch itself is entirely GPL'd.
The debate thread 
http://mail.wirex.com/pipermail/linux-security-module/2001-September/002017.html
 
that Greg KH referred to is about whether LSM (security) modules should 
ever be permitted to be proprietary. Some feel that all LSM modules 
should be OSD-compliant Open Source software, while others feel that LSM 
should continue the existing Linux module policy of permitting 
proprietary modules only if they do not require changes to the Linux 
kernel (which would make them a derived work of the kernel).
This post cc'd and reply-to'd to the LSM mailing list.
