Huh? By whom?
<sigh>.  I wanted a simple list of things which were (1) features, (2) things
which can't go in during a stable series, and (3) had been posted in the last
month without resolution.
My hope is that Linus can still freeze, but exempt any which he feels are
worthwhile, since some of them are fairly invasive and take some care to
coordinate (hence have missed out in the last month).
I think I'll keep my own list, thanks.
Rusty.
