silly question compared to all you gurus on the list, but it needs to be
asked. I need to fun freeswan (secure wan) between sever a redhat
servers. the only patched kernel i am permitted to use is the rpm for
ipsec enables 2.4.18-3. will this kernel work on redhat 7.1, or will it
fall over at the first opportunity?
thanks guys and keep up the good work, even if it does baffle mortals
like myself
