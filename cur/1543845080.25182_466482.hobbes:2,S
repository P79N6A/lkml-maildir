The zeroing of the BSS is not a function of the compiler, but the C startup
code, which might be written in assembly or c.

The alternative explaination is that explicitly changing a variable from
the BSS to have an explicit initialisation moves it into the data segment,
which results in quite a bit of data moving around.  So it might not even
be related to this - maybe a data structure alignment issue somewhere?
Shrug - but it's for powerpc folk to investigate.
Suggest you report it to powerpc folk as a bug.
