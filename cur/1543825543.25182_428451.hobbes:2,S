Subject: [PATCH] ARM: explicitly disable BTB on ixp2350
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/30/342

We don't enable the BTB on the ixp2350 as that can cause weird
crashes (erratum #42.)  However, some bootloaders enable the BTB,
which means that we have to disable the BTB explicitly.
Found thanks to Tom Rini.
