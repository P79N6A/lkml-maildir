It hasn't been removed yet. However most distributions choose not to
enable it because that would force them to compile the NFS client into
the main kernel instead of leaving it as a module.
As for the initramfs support, hpa has assured me that his klibc
distribution already has a full solution for NFS mounting on current
kernels.
