Hm. If this is like the 8253 (ugh, way way back in the good old 8085
days I really wired and programmed such a bugger on my CP/M system...), 
then the problem is, that the 16 bit counter is read in two 8 bit portions. 
And if you do this:
   Hi        Lo
 00000000 11111111   ----> read low byte:   11111111
Counter increments
 00000001 00000000   ----> read high byte:  00000001
=> Counter is 00000001 11111111 which is wrong. :-) 
Sames goes for decrement, I have forgotten in which direction this
bugger counts.
There was a trick when CPUs had much less MHz:
read low byte   -> A
read high byte  -> B
read low byte   -> C
If A and C are the same, then the counter didn't change while reading:
byte a, b, c;
a = inb(lowbyte);
for(;;) {
  b = inb(hibyte);
  c = inb(lobyte);
  if(c == a)
    break;
  a = c;
}
result = b<<8+a;
This assumes that you can't get _two_ changes in the high byte while
reading the ports in a row.

This will happen all the time, so printing out is neither a good idea
nor is the read problem described above an error. It is just a quirk
in using an 8 bit chip in an 16 bit environment without being able to
"latch" the count.
