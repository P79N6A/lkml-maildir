It applies to whoever has a DMA engine in their computer.
What people need to understand is that this is putting the
optimization in the right place, at the end nodes.  This is about as
old an internet architecting fundamental as you can get, keep the hard
work off the routers and intermediate nodes, and put it on the end
systems.
Intel has done performance numbers, and I'm sure they will post them
at the appropriate time.
