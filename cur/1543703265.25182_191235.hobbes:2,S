It is not the shared usage the frightens me so much as the shared kernel 
resources.  Slab and what not, to support the sbuff, is the first thing that 
comes to mind.  The next thing is the lateness of the bring up and that most of 
the eth interfaces require some sort of pci scan/verify, what not to get 
properly configured.  Another issue in connection with the memory thing, as near 
as I can determine, alloc and friends come up rather late in the boot sequence. 
  This has caused me fits in trying to get the ^C thing to work as an early 
"request_irq" fails because the memory subsystem will not give up the needed 
memory for the required table.
For example, if you register a function to handle a command line expression, it 
depends on where, i.e. what load order, the code is as to what it can do. 
Likewise the init functions.  If the function is setting up an interrupt handler 
it had better not be the first function the kernel calls about the command line 
as the memory management code is not yet up.  This is why, for example, in my 
patch the serial driver is in .../arch/i386/lib/  as this is loaded last and 
thus its functions get called later in the init sequence and can thus call 
"request_irq()" and get a sucess return.  Likewise the code that looks to see if 
you want to go into kgdb first thing is in a module that is loaded first so as 
to be there as early as possible.
