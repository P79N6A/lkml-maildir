Subject: [PATCH -mm] slub: update cpu after new_slab()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/25/234

SLUB gave me a NULL pointer dereference in slab_alloc(), in the
slab_lock(page) of its "Current cpuslab is acceptable" block: cpu
1 had been looking at cpu_slab[2], which then went NULL beneath it.
Since new_slab() may reenable interrupts and sleep (when __GFP_WAIT),
we may get rescheduled on a different cpu: so need to reevaluate it.
