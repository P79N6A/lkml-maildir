Oh crap.
I did all of this on an older git tree that was based on 2.6.27.4.  So
it was really 2.6.27.5 I was working with...
I've updated the patch now, the hfsplus patches were already in 2.6.27.5
so they dropped out.  It can be found as patch-2.6.27.6-rc1.gz in the
same location, with the diffstat below.
Sorry for the confusion, this release was tough to get out as it kept
crashing my boxes until I got all of the needed fixes added.
It's time for a beer...
