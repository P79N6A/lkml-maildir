In this case, we're performing basically a dma_sync*(...DMA_TO_DEVICE) 
right?  Can we be sure that a single flush is sufficient?  Is there any 
window between when we flush and when we start accessing memory with 
the device that we could get into more caching trouble?

Looks reasonable, I'm not sure we can do much better.  The only concern 
I have is that allocating some more PCI space like that may end up 
clobbering some *other* hidden BIOS mapping, but there's not a whole 
lot we can do about that.
