I don't like that part as I wrote earlier.It's a waste of precious
screen space, no matter how often you retransmit the patch.  The old
format had a chance to even fit on a 80x25 screen, with your new one
it is extremly unlikely.
Overall you're making less information available in a common case
for cosmetics.
