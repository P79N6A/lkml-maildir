Hi,
Would you suggest ee100 over eepro100 driver for an INTEL NIC ?
Currently, we are using eepro100 driver on one of our servers that have INTEL NICs installed.
I have come across a situation three times when I had to reboot the server because it hanged and wouldn't respond and next time when I rebooted the server, I did not find any messages in the /var/log/messages file.
On one of these occasions, I could see errors saying, 
kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
Jun 2 12:56:24 kernel: eth1: Transmit timed out: status f048 0c00 at 1703794288/1703794348 command 200ca000.
Jun 2 12:57:06 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
Jun 2 12:57:06 kernel: eth1: Transmit timed out: status f088 0c00 at 1703794348/1703794410 command 0001a000.
Jun 2 12:57:58 kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
Jun 2 12:57:58 kernel: eth1: Transmit timed out: status f088 0c00 at 1703794410/1703794471 command 0001a000.
I have read documentation on the net mentioning that eepro100 is a deprecated driver and isntead ee100 should be used.
I dont know if I should relate the other hangs on our server with the one when we had these "transmit timed out" errors  show up in the /var/log/messages file.
Please suggest me on this.
Thanks for your help.
