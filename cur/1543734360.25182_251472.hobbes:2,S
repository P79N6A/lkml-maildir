Even worse, AFAICS there is no guarantee that writes are atomic,
which can give unpredictable results in case of strings or arrays.
Both problems can be solved by serializing access to writable
module parameters.
Maybe we could have a global module_param_rwsem. Making the
parameter volatile does not sound like the right solution, in
fact volatile is almost always a bad idea.
