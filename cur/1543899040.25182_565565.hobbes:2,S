That's on the long-term TODO list.
libata is moving towards making libata-scsi an optional module (will 
always be around for ATAPI, and for compat with current ATA), and 
driving ATA disks as a native block driver, rather than having SCSI do 
the work for us.
libata's qc_issue/qc_complete high level API and internal modularity 
were designed to make this possible.  It is easy to see in the current 
code how libata-scsi is merely a user of the qc_issue/qc_complete API, 
with all the low-level details isolated away from that module.
Addendum:  Remember too, /dev/hdX is not just a major/minor pair, but a 
userspace interface, complete with expected ioctl support.
