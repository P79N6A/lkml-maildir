Well, I obviously strace'd it to find out why I get a memory fault without
one (I would be happy if it worked without strace ;->)

The -e switch is causing the memory fault and subsequent breakage:
743   open("/dev/hdd", O_RDWR)          = 4
743   open("/dev/loop0", O_RDWR)        = 5
743   mlockall(0x3, 0x804c272)          = 0
743   ioctl(5, LOOP_SET_FD, 0x4)        = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
743   ioctl(5, LOOP_SET_FD, 0x4)        = 0
743   ioctl(5, LOOP_SET_STATUS, 0xbffff5d8) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
743   ioctl(5, LOOP_SET_STATUS, 0xbffff5d8) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
743   ioctl(5, LOOP_SET_STATUS, 0xbffff5d8) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
743   ioctl(5, LOOP_SET_STATUS, 0xbffff5d8) = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
743   ioctl(5, LOOP_SET_STATUS <unfinished ...>
743   +++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
(which is a strange strace anyway...)
However, I just need to wait until there is a new crypto patch (and, if
not, I'll eventually have to hack it myself to gte my data. After all it's
source... ...)
