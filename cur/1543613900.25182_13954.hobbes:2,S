Maybe. I'm good at that.

Of itself, maybe. (Though an attitude like yours is a core reason Java is
spreading as slowly as it is - much like Linux desktops...)
However, heavily threaded apps regardless of language are hardly likely
to disappear; threads are the natural way to write many many things. And
if the kernel implements threads as on Linux, then the scheduler will
become much more important to good performance.
