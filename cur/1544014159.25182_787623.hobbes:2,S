Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: set acpi_enforce_resources to strict
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/6/255

The following patch changes the default for "acpi_enforce_resources" option to
"strict", disallowing access by native drivers to IO ports and memory regions
claimed by ACPI firmware.
The patch is mainly aimed to block native hwmon drivers from touching
monitoring chips that ACPI thinks it own; there have reports of such
conflicts in the past, leading to an emergency shutdown of the machine
(due to native IC driver interference ACPI TZ polling ends up reading
garbage); I'm also writing a driver for ASUS ATK0110 ACPI hwmon
interface[1], which will _definitely_ clash with native drivers.
Currently only hwmon SuperIO IC's and SMBus controllers will be affected by
this change. Unfortunately this also means that drivers for those devices will
refuse to load and users may perceive this as regression; consensus - however
- is that we shouldn't touch resources claimed by the firmware because it's too
risky since we do not know what ACPI code may be doing (and it is risky
_right now_, regardless of the new ATK driver); for people who needs to
force the loading of hwmon drivers regardless of what ACPI is doing there's is
always the possibility to set acpi_enforce_resources to "lax".
While I as at it I also documented the parameter ;-)
