And in what way is that important?  I mean, really, if this is your argument
that ext3 online resizing is a "hack" then it is pretty weak.  This does
not affect the operation or compatibility of the resized filesystem all the
way back to the stone age (i.e. every single ext2 kernel ever will work
with the resized filesystem).  That is why online resizing (and the resize
inode) are a COMPAT feature.
If I "cp b a /mnt/newfs" and "cp a b /mnt/newfs" "a" and "b" will have
different inode numbers too, but doesn't mean that "cp" is a "hack".
Cheers, Andreas
