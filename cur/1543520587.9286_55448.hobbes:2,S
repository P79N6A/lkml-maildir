I would think modularizing the PC squeaker code would add way more bloat
(especially on the source level...but I would guess there's also more
overhead in module execution than compiled-in code) than my method does,
since the whole speaker outputting code is ~15 lines. I added maybe ten more
for the dynamic stuff. A module would be decidedly overkill, I think.
...but your suggestion about the audio device hooks seems...uh, perhaps not
feasible without a loss in modularity, but it definitely might be fun to
try. I've got other projects to tinker with for the time being, so I don't
think I'm gonna get started on that...
...nonetheless, the patch is there, if anyone wants it:
ftp://gamehenge.dyndns.org/pub/squeaker/
Enjoy!
