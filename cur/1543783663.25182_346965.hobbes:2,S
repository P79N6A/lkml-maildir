That's the whole problem here, isn't it, so let's fix it the sane way 
instead of putting Descartes before Dehorse.
Anyway, to answer your implied question is: since I explicitly don't 
have to worry about forward ABI compatibility, I expose the kernel ABI 
raw.  Thus I want to be able to use the kernel ABI directly, including 
for things like struct stat.  It poses a particularly interesting 
problem, actually, because the real stat system call is called stat64 on 
most platforms.
Thus, an ABIzed <linux/abi/stat.h> or whatever it's called might export 
  "struct __kabi_stat" and "struct __kabi_stat64" with the expectation 
that the caller would "#define __kabi_stat64 stat" if that is the 
version they want.  A typedef isn't good enough for C, since you can't 
typedef struct tags.
