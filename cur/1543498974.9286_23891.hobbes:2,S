No problem - with something like /proc/mount-devs (see my previous
posting), one can easily look up or temporarily create the corresponding
device file, including all the "unnamed" ones. LILO has code for
obtaining a device by its number.

I guess I would just have reused MS_REMOUNT to avoid forcing a mount
update, but MS_MOVE is probably cleaner, considering that you can
create somewhat obscure configuration problems this way.
