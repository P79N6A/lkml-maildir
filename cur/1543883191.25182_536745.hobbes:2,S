Subject: [PATCH] [4/35] x86_64: optimize & fix APIC mode setup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/28/298

From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Fix a couple of inconsistencies/problems I found while reviewing the x86_64
genapic code (when I was chasing mysterious eth0 timeouts that would only
trigger if CPU_HOTPLUG is enabled):
 - AMD systems defaulted to the slower flat-physical mode instead
   of the flat-logical mode. The only restriction on AMD systems
   is that they should not use clustered APIC mode.
 - removed the CPU hotplug hacks, switching the default for small
   systems back from phys-flat to logical-flat. The switching to logical
   flat mode on small systems fixed sporadic ethernet driver timeouts i
   was getting on a dual-core Athlon64 system:
    NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
    eth0: Transmit timeout, status 0c 0005 c07f media 80.
    eth0: Tx queue start entry 32  dirty entry 28.
    eth0:  Tx descriptor 0 is 0008a04a. (queue head)
    eth0:  Tx descriptor 1 is 0008a04a.
    eth0:  Tx descriptor 2 is 0008a04a.
    eth0:  Tx descriptor 3 is 0008a04a.
    eth0: link up, 100Mbps, full-duplex, lpa 0xC5E1
 - The use of '<= 8' was a bug by itself (the valid APIC ids
   for logical flat mode go from 0 to 7, not 0 to 8). The new logic
   is to use logical flat mode on both AMD and Intel systems, and
   to only switch to physical mode when logical mode cannot be used.
   If CPU hotplug is racy wrt. APIC shutdown then CPU hotplug needs
   fixing, not the whole IRQ system be made inconsistent and slowed
   down.
 - minor cleanups: simplified some code constructs
build & booted on a couple of AMD and Intel SMP systems.
