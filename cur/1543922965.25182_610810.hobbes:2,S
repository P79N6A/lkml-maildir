Ok, can't sleep.. took a look. I have several problems here.
The thing that makes it go *boom* is the __ATTR_NULL. Removing that
makes it boot. Albeit it then warns me of multiple duplicate sysfs
objects, all named "bdi".
For some obscure reason this device interface insists on using the
bus_id as name (?!), and further reduces usability by limiting that to
20 odd characters.
This makes it quite useless. I tried fudging around that limit by using
device_rename and kobject_rename, but to no avail.
Really, it should not be this hard to use, trying to expose a handfull
of simple integers to userspace should not take 8h+ and still not work.
Peter, who thinks sysfs is contorted mess beyond his skill. I'll stick
to VM and scheduler code, that actually makes sense.
