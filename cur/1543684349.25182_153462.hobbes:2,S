Hi,
Could someone inform as to what is the behavior when madvise DONTNEED is 
called on pages that are mmap'd from local files mapped with MAP_SHARED, 
i.e. they share the same page that the file cache does.  In such cases, can 
madvise be made to release specific pages in the file cache by mmap-ing the 
relevant file segment ?
thanks,
Muthian.
