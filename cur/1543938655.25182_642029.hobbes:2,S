This patchset has been merged into Linux 2.6.24.

Unfortunately, the new EFI support patches do not use EFI memory map for
system boot up (just for runtime service support). The EFI memory map is
converted into E820 memory map in bootloader. The main reason for this
change is to remove the duplication between E820 memory map and EFI
memory map handling code.
So, I think the resolution for your problem is the "struct setup_data"
mechanism proposed by H. Peter Anvin. That is a linked list data
structure for boot parameter without size limitation. I have ever writen
a patch for it, but there are some issues for implementation scheme.
Most people think it should be based on the "early reservation/early
allocation" mechanism from Andi Kleen. So I am waiting that is merged by
-mm or git-x86.
