Yeah, that's what I mean. Important point: prohibits, rather than
better/worse.

Well OK, if that's your definition. Not very helpful though.
Can I win this argument by defining sched_load_balance
to crapify it? :)

Why isn't that possible with my approach?

What happens when you partition the system with your approach, and
you get kernel threads being spawned into the root cpuset and getting
unbalanced?
With my approach, these can get naturally balanced.

Obviously any approach cannot retain the existing kernel API, true.

I just still don't understand how those cases work... if you can spell it
out for me.

The above sentence was explaining which proposal I was talking
about.
