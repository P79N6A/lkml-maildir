Given that people seem to agree that authorship information has no place 
in the binary, that might actually be best.
The problem I'm trying to solve is letting people know whom to contact. 
Having multiple authors in the MODULES_AUTHOR tag and maintainers who 
might not be authors are two reasons the current tag doesn't work.
Keeping copyright holders in a copyright header and maintainers in the 
MAINTAINERS file would at least avoid the confusing message the tag 
sends. As you say in a previous message, users should mostly in fact be 
contacting their vendor if using distro kernels or, if they're using 
kermel.org kernels, linux-kernel and can then find the information in 
the MAINTAINERS file.
So, MODULE_AUTHOR be gone?
Rene.
