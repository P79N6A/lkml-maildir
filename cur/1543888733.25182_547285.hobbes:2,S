This was an effect of me suggesting to switch off CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG. If 
you did not run without CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG then you were not affected by 
the problem. And the earlier case that you reported was a version of SLUB 
that did not have the capability to switch off SLUB_DEBUG.
Is there any way we can boot with "slub_debug" on the kernel command line 
and get early printk output? Looks like an early failure that may have to 
do with other kernel debug options being on (lockdep or so?)
