It's the cdrom CDROMREADAUDIO vs SG_IO interface, there's not ata/atapi
specific interface.

Definitely, that's the big question. It could just be that cdparanoia
enables extra error correction/checking, which it can do since it
tailors the SCSI commands to its liking. Where as with CDROMREADAUDIO,
you're basically stuck with whatever is coded into the cdrom layer.

Could very well be. Once could use blktrace to see what the commands
submitted to the drives look like and get some data out of that.
Sebastian, care to try one more thing? Patch your kernel with this
little patch and try ripping a known "faulty" track again _not_ using
SG_IO. See if that produces the same faulty results again, or if it
actually works.
