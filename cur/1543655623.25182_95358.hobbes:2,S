Let me help out here if I may.  First, not to rain on your
parade but, when I did high-res timers on another system,
far away and long ago, we dropped support for the hardware
timers.  I.e. I would submit that the POSIX timers interface
to a common system timer does all you need and more.  You
MAY want to consider using your hardware as the system clock
underlying jiffies and all the system timers, but that is
another issue.
You also may want to define a new CLOCK for the POSIX
timers.  Most of this capability is in place in the current
patch.  I did notice, however, that I took a short cut on
the clock_nanosleep code and assumed that it was a standard
clock.  This is easy to change...   The new CLOCK(s) would
then talk to your hardware.  The problem you will encounter,
and which the high-res-patch solves, is making the timers
available to all comers, i.e. there is no reservation system
or busy counter, etc.  Just a nice set timer and give me a
signal when it is done.
You can code a blocking interface using the sigwait and
friends calls which will also cut down of the timer delivery
overhead by eliminating the signal.
So what more could you ask for?
