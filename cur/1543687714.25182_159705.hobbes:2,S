Right now we can't as events are queued in an event list and are processed by 
other thread; serio does not know that it's queued and even existence of the
event list is not known outside of serio.c module.
Do you think we should introduce allocate_serio/free_serio pair for dynamically 
allocated serios; free_serio would scan event_list and invalidate events that 
refer to freed serio?
