I'm not sure it can do that, if the kernel policy is to
be 8-bit clean (to allow UTF-8 to work without coding
UTF-8 knowledge into the kernel).
What the code could do is not printk() user-influenced strings
at all. For example, mm/oom_kill.c could print just the process
ID here:
   printk(KERN_ERR "Out of Memory: Killed process %d (%s).\n",
          p->pid, p->comm);
The usual solution to this problem is to mark user-derived
strings as tainted and then check for the taint attribute
when strings are requested to be output.  But since this
is a kernel I don't suppose you'd be keen doing that :-)
I suppose you need a policy decision -- are strings scrubbed
on input (I've coded this once and it is really quite tricky).
And then do you need a scrubbed and non-scrubbed version of
p->comm (as comparing scrubbed p->comm for equality is
problematic and probably expolitable). Or do you simply not
output strings which have been tainted by contact with users.
