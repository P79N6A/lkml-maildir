Long thread or not, taking out one's entire system because one
device hits a fail state is always wrong.
If I have other block devices which are working, all I want
is for this specific controller and it's block devices to
fail.
This way I can get the failure log message and actually do something
with that data without rebooting.
Or I guess digital cameras and serial/net consoles are the only
sanctioned way to record kernel failure log messages of this kind?
Give me a break. :)
