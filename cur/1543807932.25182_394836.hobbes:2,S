Ok. After talking with the vserver guys on IRC.  I think grasp the
importance.  The key feature is to have a place to put limits and the
like for your entire container.  Look at all of the non-signal stuff
in struct signal for an example.  The nested namespaces seem to
be just an implementation detail.
For OpenVZ having the other namespaces nested may have some
importance.  I haven't gotten their yet.
The task->container->pspace->.... thing feels very awkward to me,
and feels like it increases our chance getting a cache miss.
So I support the concept of a place to put all of the odd little
things like rlimits for containers.  But I would like to flatten
it in the task_struct if we can.
