There are, but most I've had discussions with on LKML and x86-4 ML are running 
recent 2.6 series kernels (successfully).
Best advice is 
1) Upgrade your bios to latest. Bios problems seem to account for most >4Gb 
mem problems on x86_64. Pay careful attention to bios memory settings also.
2) Report problems using lastest 2.4 kernel here for help
If you can use 2.6 kernel, you're likely to get more help. 2.4 is in 
maintenance mode. Most people here will be running/developing 2.6
