But they *don't* map to consistent device names. All hot pluggable 
devices seem to map to the next available name. Looking at one of my 
utility systems, it has IDE drives mapped by Redhat with ide-scsi, real 
SCSI drives, a couple of flash card slots mapped to SCSI, and a USB 
device, all in the /dev/sdX namespace. And in the order in which they 
were detected (connected, in other words).
Joerg hasn't made it any better, but it isn't great anyway. I recommend 
a script to do discovery and make symlinks somewhere to names which 
always match the same device.
