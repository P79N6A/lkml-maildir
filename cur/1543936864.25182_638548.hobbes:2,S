Thanks Kumar/Morton/Kim
I shall make a small paragraph which describes the TDM driver
architecture and the interfaces it exposes.
As far as 8315 TDM is concerned it is a non QE driver and quite
different from this except for the functionality and external interface
it exposes.
Right now TDM is not a full-fledged bus driver which probably can be
done may be very similar to SPI.
Please give your suggestions on this.
With Regards
Poonam

I'm ok w/taking the arch/powerpc bits, but I"m a bit concerned about  
the driver itself.  I'm wondering if we need a TDM framework in the  
kernel.
I guess if Poonam could possibly describe how this driver is actually  
used that would be helpful.  I see we have 8315 with a discrete TDM  
block and I'm guessing 82xx/85xx based CPM parts of some form of TDM  
as well.
