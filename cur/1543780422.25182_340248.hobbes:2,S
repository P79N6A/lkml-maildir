hi,
thanks for your reply. i've resolved the thing by changing the kernel
config. i don't know what exactly solved it, my guess is that now i
don't have ACPI as modules anymore but compiled in. could also be other
things, e.g. i didn't compile in preemption anymore.
the new config is attached and i'm running 2.6.12-gentoo-r7 now.

on the weekend i also tested 2.6.13-rc4-mm1, attached is the logfile
from 2.6.13-rc4-mm1, if it doesn't help please tell me, then i'll retest
latest vanilla tomorrow.
