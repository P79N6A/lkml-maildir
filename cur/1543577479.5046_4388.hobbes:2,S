You have to take a look at ENC:
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows routers to notify
clients about network congestion, resulting in fewer dropped packets
and increased network performance. This option adds ECN support to the
Linux kernel, as well as a sysctl (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn) which
allows ECN support to be disabled at runtime.
Note that, on the Internet, there are many broken firewalls which
refuse connections from ECN-enabled machines, and it may be a while
before these firewalls are fixed. Until then, to access a site behind
such a firewall (some of which are major sites, at the time of this
writing) you will have to disable this option, either by saying N now
or by using the sysctl.
You can disable it at runtime with:
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn

     Learning French is trivial: the word for horse is cheval, and
               everything else follows in the same way.
