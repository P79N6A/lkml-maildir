Hi All,
at the suggestion of Chris (chris@ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk) I wrote a simple
checker to warn when the length parameter to copy_*_user was (1) an
integer and (2) not checked < 0.    
As an example, the ipv6 routine rawv6_geticmpfilter gets an integer 'len'
from user space, checks that it is smaller than a struct size and then
uses length as an argument to copy_to_user: 
                if (get_user(len, optlen))
                        return -EFAULT;
                if (len > sizeof(struct icmp6_filter))
                        len = sizeof(struct icmp6_filter);
                if (put_user(len, optlen))
                        return -EFAULT;
                if (copy_to_user(optval, &sk->tp_pinfo.tp_raw.filter, len))
                        return -EFAULT;
Is this a real bug?  Or is the checked rule only applicable to
__copy_*_user routines rather than copy_*_user routines?  (If its a real
bug, theres about 8 others that we found).
Thanks,
Dawson
