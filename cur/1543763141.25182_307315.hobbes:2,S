Your get_pgd_slow patch looks good to me.  Yes, it slightly increases
the assumptions here about what is done in common, to the extent of a
pmd_populate, but even the nr_page_table_pages adjustment just nicely
balances what you were already having to do in free_pgd_slow.
Sorry for dumping you suddenly into this with my BUG_ON(mm->nr_ptes),
but I think we all agree it's a worthwhile check now.  And sorry for
being so slow to respond, but I needed to think through what's right
for your case.
I'll write separately about Nick's FIRST_USER_ADDRESS patch,
I'm still puzzled, and not quite happy with that one.
