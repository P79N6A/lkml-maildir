We've had the existing implementation for quite some time. The arguments
against changing it have been the same all along: if your application
wants to share files between threads, the portability argument implies
that you should either use pread/pwrite or use a mutex or some other
form of synchronisation primitive in order to ensure that
lseek()/read()/write() do not overlap.
