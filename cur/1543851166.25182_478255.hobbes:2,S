First of all, from "lost timer ticks" messages and the fact that "notsc"
decreases the number of ticks lost can't be concluded as a TSC sync issue.
Some device is hogging interrupts which results in lost timer ticks and from
your 2.6.18 interrupts info, usb seems to be the culprit.. It is probably
a side effect that "notsc" decreases the lost timer ticks..
copied Len who seems to be the owner of the bug for his thoughts..
