Badly worded question, but it got answered anyway. What I really meant
to as was "does async_tx use memcpy", I thought it only used xor. Good
to know.

Ok, one could argue that it'd make more sense to have a way to issue a
memcpy (or other op) with a callback. Anyway, both methods work.

Well, it'd be slightly more efficient to do add the interrupt attribute
to the last issued descriptor when it's known in advance. If the
underlying driver doesn't support it, adding a separate descriptor would
be a good fallback.
Anyway, this isn't likely to be a performance bottleneck. If it turns
out to be, I'll refactor it and submit patches.

Why? That just adds overhead and latency.
