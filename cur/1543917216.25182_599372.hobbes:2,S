I used the wrong choice of words. The correct one is, as you say, to
add methods for exporting the iBFT through sysfs.

My end goal is to export the iBFT data via individual sysfs attribute files. I 
was thinking to do that in the next version of this code and build on top of 
this patch. 
This way the existing exploiter (iscsi-initiator-utils) can use the parsing 
code it already has to extract the data from the binary blob. Then in the 
next version of the iscsi-initiator-utils (and for the kernel) I can post a 
patch for supporting (and exporting in the kernel) individual sysfs attribute 
files.
