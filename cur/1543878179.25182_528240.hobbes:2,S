What about attacking the explosion of kernel threads?
As CPU counts increase, the number of per-CPU kernel threads gets really 
ridiculous.
I would rather change the implementation under the hood to start per-CPU 
threads on demand, similar to a thread-pool implementation.
Boxes with $BigNum CPUs probably won't ever use half of those threads.
