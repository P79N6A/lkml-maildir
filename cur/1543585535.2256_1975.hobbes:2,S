Sure. But I seriously suspect that sync_dev() is wrong in 100% of cases.
So "flag" is eventually going to become "do we want to sync it or not?"
thing. However, I don't want to deal with that sort of analysis right now -
callers are in drivers/* and we are in even branch.

I also don't like them. I _don't_ believe that magic #defines are
any better, though. And I would rather localize the get_super() to
kernel proper preserving the current behaviour and left dealing
with the sync vs. fsync to 2.5. It's easy to grep and if my gut
feeling is correct your invalidate_dev_sync() is going to be a ballast.
Again, for 2.4 I would rather do a change that obviously doesn't
change behaviour of drivers, doesn't add functions without need
and is easy to review once drivers become a fair game again (== in 2.5).
Comments?
