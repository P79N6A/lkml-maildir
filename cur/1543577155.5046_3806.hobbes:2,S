I put the while(1) there to give all threads time to do their work.
You know, it was just a quick & dirty test case.

I don't think so, but I'm not a gdb expert. In any case, I did test
the program on ext2 and it behaved correctly all the time. You don't
need gdb to reproduce the smbfs problems, you can also use strace.
So there's nothing wrong with gdb.

It seems to work perfectly. I tested with up to 10 threads in 2
simulteneous processes with both ext2 and smbfs. I'll do further
testing in the next days.
Many thanks for fixing that.
