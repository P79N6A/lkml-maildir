But... power key is not really a powermanagment and we do not want to
have 1000 different ways "deliver info about power key into
userspace".
And acpi way of delivery things is not really suitable.... it mixes
power key (and similar) with battery alarms etc. ACPI interface is
*not* nice, lets not emulate that one.

Yes, maybe userspace is not interested in "space" key. In such case
userland simply ignores "space" event. I do not know why "power" key
should be handled in any other way.
