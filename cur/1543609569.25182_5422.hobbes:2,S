Your statement seems inconsistent with the comment above
fs/ext2/ialloc.c:ext2_new_inode():
/*
 * There are two policies for allocating an inode.  If the new inode is
 * a directory, then a forward search is made for a block group with both
 * free space and a low directory-to-inode ratio; if that fails, then of
 * the groups with above-average free space, that group with the fewest
 * directories already is chosen.
 *
 * For other inodes, search forward from the parent directory\'s block
 * group to find a free inode.
 */
So N successive calls to mkdir(2), with the same parent, should result
in those directories being stored in the same block group as each
other. And, furthermore, if the parent directory block group is mostly
empty, then the child directories are placed adjacent to the parent's
block group.

If my reading of the comment above is correct, then the shuffling will
provide a gain.

Sure. But it would provide me with a way of getting a better layout
for my kernel trees, and it might prove useful for other applications
and kernels. And it will provide a good fallback if good in-kernel
heuristic isn't forthcoming.

It would, if you were correct about the current implementation. Which
I think isn't the case.

I think it currently *does*. Check the comment. Straight from the
2.4.14 sources.
