Sounds like the PCI PM state is getting mangled.  Can you provide a
"lspci -vvv", as root, for each of the three cardbus cards?  Make sure
to run lspci when the cards are up and active and working.

If the link is getting lost (which may explain the randomness of the
error), the following patch might help: 
http://sourceforge.net/patch/?func=detailpatch&patch_id=103294&group_id=13004
There are still some media fixes that need to be integrated from the
Becker driver, and tested, too.
Also, downloading tulip-diag.c and capturing the register state before
and after the breakage is useful.  A useful command line is "tulip-diag
-mmmaaavvveef".
