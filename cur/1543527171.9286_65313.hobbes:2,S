/proc/sys/dev/rtc/{time,date,epoch,...} probably would be better,
although sometimes with changing devices one have to consider the
issue of atomicity; sometimes one *have* to be able to perform complex
operations atomically.  IMNSHO that's what /dev/rtc is for.
I personally think the strict formatting of sysctl() is a good thing,
although I do have to agree 10000% with Linus that sysctl() should be
entirely string-based.  As for the sysctl() system call, I would
either remove it or replace it with a system call taking a file
descriptor to the appropriate /proc/sys node.  Although redundant, it
might provide somewhat less overhead than the /proc/sys interface.
