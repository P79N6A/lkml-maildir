Close but not cigar. Trying to load modules blocks the system quite a
bit and I get lots of failures like realloc errors which unfortunately
disappear too fast from the screen to capture. The system is still
booting after 6 mins...
  257 root      15 -10  257m 227m 1176 D 80.8 45.1   0:22.67 modprobe
The system is fully saturated by modprobes... :(
