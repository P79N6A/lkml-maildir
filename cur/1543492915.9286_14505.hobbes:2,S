Mindcraft also used the v0.92 MegaRAID driver.  An SMP race condition was
fixed in v0.93 which was almost certainly available from the AMI web site
long before the Mar 10-13 test.  So SMP NT "beat" a non-SMP Linux on a
quad-Xeon server.  Big hairy deal.
After COMDEX I'm upgrading my dual-Pentium/233 system with a MegaRAID 428
using Linux 2.2.5-ac6 (or later) and the Apache Secure Server from RH5.2.
I won't have 144 client PCs to duplicate Mindcraft's test load, but I do
have a P-II/266 laptop and 100 Mbps connectivity to the big system.  Can
anyone suggest a way to simulate high loads from one client?
