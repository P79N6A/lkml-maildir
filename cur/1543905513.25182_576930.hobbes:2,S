After even more tests I found out the following:
- Running 'dd_rescue /dev/sda1 /dev/zero' on the
on-board Silicon Image Inc. SiI 3114 controller
handles the bad sector just fine and does not give a
MCE. This is on the same motherboard that does give
the MCE error on the Nvidia port.
The following SATA controllers are in that machine:
* IDE interface: nVidia Corporation CK804 Serial ATA
Controller (rev f3)
* RAID bus controller: Silicon Image, Inc. SiI 3114
[SATALink/SATARaid] Serial ATA Controller (rev 02)
- Running the dd_rescue command om another PC with a
different type of motherboard (M2NPV-VM) also with a
Nvidia Nforce 4 (altough different) chipset work fine
and reports the bad sector like the SiL 3114
controller on the other PC.
This PC has the following lspci listing for SATA
controller:
* IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP51 Serial ATA
Controller (rev a1)
So I think there is a problem with this specific CK804
ATA controller causing the MCE... Any clues?
