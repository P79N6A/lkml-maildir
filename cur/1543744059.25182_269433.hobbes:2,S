If you didn't have the foresight to keep that kernel version around,
there isn't much we can do to help you.  Yes, this may mean you have
a big bunch of /usr/src/linux-2.6.* directories.
Note that you can *still* get screwed unless you keep the same
compiler toolchain around...

Yes, instead you can spend a whole day reinstalling from a
distribution CD, and then restoring user files from backup,
because the new module you just 'insmod -f' had a different
number of parameters to some kernel call, and as a result your
stack got smashed and took the root filesystem with it....
