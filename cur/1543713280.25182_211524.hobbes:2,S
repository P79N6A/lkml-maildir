Hopefully not point out the obvious, but since you have the lead time,
you could set the TTLs on the DNS entries pretty low (say 5 minutes or
so) now so by the time the changeover is happening, it's fully
propagated.  This way, if you do wind up with the different IP address
scenario, just make the DNS change and it will propagate within minutes
and most folks will never notice.  Once everything is stable again, you
can run the TTL back up.  
A quick check shows that www.bkbits.net has it's TTL set to 86400 (1
day) which means other servers will cache that for up to a day and with
multiple levels of DNS, that can wind up taking awhile to expire.  Bring
that down and things should go smoothly.
Just a thought....
