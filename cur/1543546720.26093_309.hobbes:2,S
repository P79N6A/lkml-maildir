.. quite frankly, we should be getting _rid_ of that horribly ugly
construct. We should NOT add to it.
The copy_from_user_ret() define is both BUGGY and UGLY: it's buggy because
it is done as a statement expression even though it's not actually an
expression at all.
It is ugly because it fails to honour _any_ of the good rules of
programming: it looks like a function, not a #define (as shown by the
case), and it has non-function-behaviour.
In short, avoid it like the plague. Anything that contains it is _not_ a
cleanup, but an addign of warts. The only users of that construct from
hell are basically bad drivers.
Please just use the obvious code instead:
	return copy_from_user(to,from,n) ? -EFAULT : 0;
and don't use the silly macro that some broken drivers insist on using.
