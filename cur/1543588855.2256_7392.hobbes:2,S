[ Alan, I'm lazy and only have 2.2.14 sources on-line. Maybe this has
  been fixed already and there's something else going on. Worth a look ]

[ Looks closer at the ptrace synchronization ]
Ahh.. This actually _does_ look like a race on "current->flags":
PTRACE_ATTACH will do a
	child->flags |= PF_PTRACED;
without waiting for the child to have stopped.
(Aside: thinking more about the stopping logic - I'm not actually sure
the ptrace synchronization is complete wrt scheduling, as there will be
a window when the process has set the task state to TASK_STOPPED but
hasn't actually yet scheduled away. Oh, well).
All other ptrace operations (not counting killing the child) will check
that the child is quiescent.  But PTRACE_ATTACH will not, as we're just
setting up the stopping.
In 2.4.x, this bug doesn't happen because "flags" was split up into
"current->ptrace" and "current->flags".  Exactly because of locking
concerns.
