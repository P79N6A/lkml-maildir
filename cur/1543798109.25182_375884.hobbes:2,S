Subject: [PATCH] Export cpu topology for IA32 and x86_64 by sysfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/13/460

The patch exports the cpu topology info through sysfs on ia32/x86_64
machines. The info is similar to /proc/cpuinfo.
The exported items are:
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/physical_package_id(representing
the physical package id of  cpu X)
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/core_id (representing the cpu core
id  to cpu X)
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/thread_siblings (representing the
thread siblings to cpu X)
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/topology/core_siblings (represeting the
core siblings to cpu X)
