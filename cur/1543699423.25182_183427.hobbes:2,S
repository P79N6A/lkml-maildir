Hi mates
Greetings to everybody
I am a newbie to compile this linux kernel compilation.
I am trying to compile the kernel which supported ARM processor
(SA1110-Assabet)
While compiling i am getting the error as followed.
CC      init/version.o
LD      init/built-in.o
LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/arm/mach-sa1100/built-in.o(.text+0xdf8): In function
sa11x0_pm_prepare':
undefined reference to `nmi_watchdog_disable'
arch/arm/mach-sa1100/built-in.o(.text+0xe10): In function
sa11x0_pm_finish':
undefined reference to `nmi_watchdog_enable'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
1. when i was grepping the nmi_watchdog i found this in nmi.c files located
at arch/i386/kernel
  arch/ppc/kernel folders , but it is not available at arm folder.
2. Why do i need power managment, even if i am disabling it in .config using
make menuconfig.
any patches or nmi.c for arm processor.?
