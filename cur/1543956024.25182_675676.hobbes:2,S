When playing a DVD and then suspending the system while the DVD is
still in play, upon wakeup I'm receiving a Buffer I/O error on device
sr0, logical block 356490.
the DVD will continue to play but then gmplayer complains: Warning!
FPS changed 23.976 -> 29.970 (-5.994005) [4] then the video becomes
very choppy. When looking at osx in the same test the DVD will be
paused until the cd player aligns itself, then playback will start.
With looking further at this I think this is an issue of a library or
codec, So with this in mind is there a package that I might look at to
see if this resolves the issue. Attached is dmesg of the Buffer I/O
regards;
