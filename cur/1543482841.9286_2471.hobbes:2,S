Partly its stuff that changes over time.
As to "where is the documentation". Please do help with that, the Linux
Documentation project has a free kernel internals book in progress. Dave
Rusling has done some superb work on it but many hands make light work.
In addition Bodo from SuSE has recently contributed a chunk of documentation
on /proc and /proc/sys - its not complete by any means but its a hell of a lot
better than the current stuff. That should be in 2.2.1 or so - please
contribute there
