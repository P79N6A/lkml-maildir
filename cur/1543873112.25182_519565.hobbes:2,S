Most Asus boards have jumpers for the USB ports to select between +5V
and +5VSB (stand by power).  The reason to provide standby power is so
that keyboards with power buttons can remain powered so that you can
turn the system on using the usb keyboard.  If you want to power off the
ports entirely, jumper them to the +5V line instead which only has power
when the system is on.
