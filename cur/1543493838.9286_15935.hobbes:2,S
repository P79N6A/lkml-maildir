Linux kernel 2.2.6 with the stock de4x5 driver.
It appears that the de4x5 shares nicely with the first aic7xxx on that IRQ,
but somehow "disconnects" the IRQ handler for the second one. As a result,
every request pending on that SCSI card times out almost exactly as if the
card has been rocked out of its socket. Just FYI, the two aic7xxx's are on
IRQ 17, an IO-APIC IRQ. 
Also, the tulip driver works fine in this situation (if I do
-DREVERSE_PROBE_ORDER), despite the fact that it assigns IRQ's to the card's
ports very weirdly (and totally different than what /proc/pci says). Also,
if I load and unload the tulip driver, it will reassign IRQ's as per
/proc/pci. Odd.
