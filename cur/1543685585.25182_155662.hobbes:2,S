Subject: 2.6 bug: kconfig implementation doesn't match the spec
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Roman,
the implementation of the !-operator doesn't match the spec in
Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt
kconfig-language.txt says:
<--  snip  -->
...
           '!' <expr>                           (5)
...
(5) Returns the result of (2-/expr/).
...
An expression can have a value of 'n', 'm' or 'y' (or 0, 1, 2
respectively for calculations). A menu entry becomes visible when it's
expression evaluates to 'm' or 'y'.
...
<--  snip  -->
The current implementation evaluates !m to 0 instead of 1.
An example:
config FOO
        tristate
        default m
config BAR
        tristate
        default y if !FOO
        default n
According to the kconfig spec BAR should be y, but the implementation in
2.6.0-mm5 sets BAR to n.
BTW:
The semantics of the implemention seems to be a bit less surprising 
than the semantics of the spec.
