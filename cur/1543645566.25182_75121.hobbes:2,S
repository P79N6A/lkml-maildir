This may be fixed.

This is still broken.  Plus, it has a limited number of retries before it 
simply returns an I/O error, so it basically hammers the device (so it 
can't get unbusy) until a set number of retries have completed then it 
returns an I/O error, giving all sorts of false I/O errors on devices that 
use BUSY status.

The current 2.5 mid layer is still tag stupid.  It has no concept of tag 
depth adjustment (although I have a patch here that implements this bit, 
it really needs updating to the current kernels).

No, you still can't yet, but we hope to have that fixed before the next 
stable kernel series.
