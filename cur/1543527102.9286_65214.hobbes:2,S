I don't know if it is of any help to you, but I have also seen messages
like these quiet regularly during the last couple of days.
Below are those I found in my logs. The ones marked with (*) happened
when the "updatedb" cron job runs, which of course causes heavy disk
activity.

(*) 	Feb 18 07:36:45 03:02: elevator nr_segments 86 should be 87
