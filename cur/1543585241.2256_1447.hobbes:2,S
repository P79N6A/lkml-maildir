You should be able to get about 30 MB/s at the start of the disk (zone 0) according to IBM's datasheet at
http://ssdweb01.storage.ibm.com/techsup/hddtech/prodspec/dtla_spw.pdf
so if you were testing say /dev/hda1 which is at the start of the disk it should be faster.
Try hdparm -i /dev/hda (or whatever) .. . note the reported MaxMultSect= value,
and put it in place of X in command:
hdparm -u 1 -d 1 -m X -c 1 /dev/hda
Cheers,
Jeremy
PS - please let me know if this fixed your problem, since I have a system
with the same motherboard.
