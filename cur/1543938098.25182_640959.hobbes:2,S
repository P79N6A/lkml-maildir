Great work!

Thanks a lot for this, it works great! (with CONFIG_GEODE_MFGPT_TIMER
not set).
However some minor issues:
Could the name of the /dev entry perhaps be changed from
"geode-watchdog" to "watchdog" instead?
I think all other watchdogs use "watchdog", and using two different
watchdogs in the same machine won't work anyway, because of the same
minor number, right?
As a second point my gcc (4.1.2) issues a warning:
drivers/watchdog/geodewdt.c: In function ‘geodewdt_remove’:
drivers/watchdog/geodewdt.c:256: warning: control reaches end of
non-void function
which I think is a valid one.
