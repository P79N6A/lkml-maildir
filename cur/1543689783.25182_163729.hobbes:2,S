Look for lots of retransmits from the client.  This might be the bug
where it adjusts the retransmit timeout to a ridiculously small
sub-millisecond value, because of a sequence of fast cached responses
from the server, then when the server responds slowly due to a disk
access the client times out within milliseconds.  Repeatedly.
