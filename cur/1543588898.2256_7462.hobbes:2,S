I've been running masquerading unchanged from 2.2.13, currently 2.2.19 as:
        real IP +
         masq.                 192.168.1.NNN
DSL <-> gateway <-> switch <-> client 1
        server             <-> client 2
                           ...
                           <-> client n
There was some general slowness over the last few days (Bay Area, California
<-> US East Coast) including realaudio being unable to locate servers and/or
content.  This one is working right now:
RealPlayer v 7.0.3.338
abit:~ > cat On24ram.asp
rtsp://rm.on24.com/media/news/04192001/palumbo_ted6.rm
--stop--
http://rm.on24.com/media/news/04192001/palumbo_ted6.rm
Try '# strace /usr/bin/X11/realplay On24ram.asp > log' and see where the
connect fails if you aren't getting specific error messages.
