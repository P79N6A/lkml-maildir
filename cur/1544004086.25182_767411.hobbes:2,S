It does.  If there were not any two physically-contiguous free pages in
the page allocator reserves, __alloc_pages() will not be able to
satisfy that order-1 allocation request.
You can have plenty of free memory, but if it's all fragmented,
non-order-0 atomic allocations can still fail.
GFP_KERNEL allocations can run page reclaim to _make_ the allocation
request succeed in this situation.
