Hmm...no easy solution then.
In any case, the current behaviour is not compliant with the POSIX text that 
Andries posted.  Perhaps this should be documented somewhere?
Alternately, how about having the recvmsg() call return a zero, and (if 
appropriate) the length of the name set to zero?  This appears to comply with 
the man page for recvmsg().
