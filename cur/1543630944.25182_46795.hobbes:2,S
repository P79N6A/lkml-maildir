What's your exact chipset ?
`lspci | grep "00:00.0"` should show it.
SiS5513 is the IDE interface device shown on the PCI bus but there are a
hell lot of revisions.
BadCRC can be due to flaky hardware but I guess incorrect timings could be
another source of the problem. The only case of incorrect timings I'm aware
of is for ATA133: SiS645DX (just began working on it).
The IDE code should lower the DMA mode by itself when it sees BadCRC, what's
the output of `hdparm -i /dev/hda` after these errors show up ?
LB.
