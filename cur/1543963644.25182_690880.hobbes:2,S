Another possibility, would something like this work?
 /*
  * null out the begin function, no new begin calls can be made
  */
 rcu_assing_pointer(my_notifier.invalidate_start_begin, NULL); 
 /*
  * lock/unlock all rmap locks in any order - this ensures that any
  * pending start() will have its end() function called.
  */
 mm_barrier(mm);
 /*
  * now that no new start() call can be made and all start()/end() pairs
  * are complete we can remove the notifier.
  */
 mmu_notifier_remove(mm, my_notifier);
This requires a mmu_notifier instance per attached mm and that
__mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start() uses rcu_dereference() to obtain
the function.
But I think its enough to ensure that:
  for each start an end will be called
It can however happen that end is called without start - but we could
handle that I think.
