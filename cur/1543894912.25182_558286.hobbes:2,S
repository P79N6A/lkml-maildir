HEAD doesn't mean what you think it means. It's the latest revision on the 
branch with the *. What you want is:
$ git checkout master
This will move the * to "master", which shouldn't have been affected by 
any of this, and move your working directory to this point as well. At 
that point, you should be able to build a working kernel.
What "git reset --hard HEAD" does is discard any differences to tracked 
files between your working directory and the revision you're on. It's 
relevant if you want to discard local changes, not otherwise.
