I still have a television that I bought in 1985 when I was 15, it's still
going strong and I'm hardly going to chuck it away for quite a long time.
Given that statement, any appliances that lasts that long will still be in
use by 2038.
Give me a Linux powered TV for the 21st century. ;o)
Cheers, 
Alex
