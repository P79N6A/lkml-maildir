Subject: [PATCH] nvidiafb: Geforce 7800 series support added

Hi, this patch replaces a patch I prevously submitted.  The previous patch 
was named:
  nvidiafb-geforce-7800-gtx-support-added.patch
Which was added to the -mm tree on Oct. 25.
Can you replace the above mentioned patch with this one, since it is more 
updated?
This patch replaces the above patch, and is simply a better version of 
that patch with more support for more cards.
Altogether this is an almost trivial patch that simply adds support for 
the Nvidia Geforce 7800 series of cards to the nvidiafb framebuffer 
driver.  All this patch does is add the PCI device id for the 7800, 7800 
GTX, 7800 GO, and 7800 GTX GO cards to the module device table for the 
nvidiafb.ko driver, so that nvidiafb.ko will actually work on these cards.
I also added the relevant PCI device ids to linux/pci_ids.h (I hope noone 
minds).
I tested it on my 7800 GTX here and it works like a charm.  I now can get 
framebuffer support on this card!  Woo hoo!!  Nothing like 200x75 text mode to 
make your eyes BLEED. ;)
This patch is against 2.6.14-rc5.  It should apply against most 2.6 kernels 
though -- not sure which kernel is the standard one to submit patches against.
Should I submit this patch for 2.4 kernel?  I don't even know if that one has 
nvidiafb since I don't run 2.4 much these days..
Thanks!
