Hi,
while playing an audio CD with XMMS using digital audio extraction the
kernel started flooding my logs (syslog writes my kernel logs synchronously)
with the following message:
 cdrom: dropping to single frame dma
 arq->state: 4

This happens both with my DVD unit and the CD/RW unit. The cause may be
a couple of skratches on the disk (my portable cd player is happy with
it though) and the drives behave fine with other audio disks. In the
dmesg there isn't any other error related to the cd (i.e. no medium
errors...)
As workaround I'm using noop scheduler for the unit...
