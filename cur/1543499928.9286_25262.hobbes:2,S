Subject: ext2fs corruption on 2.3.7

I think that some file system corruption still exists in 2.3.7.  I copied
over the quake2 pak0.pak from my p200 running 2.3.6 to my dual pIII 450
running 2.3.7 and am getting different md5sums between the file on the two
machines.  I have tested the copy via both ftp and nfs with the same end
result (though the md5sum on the 2.3.7 system was different each time).  
Unfortunately, I haven't the _slightest_ idea of where to start looking
for the problem, but I'm willing to test patches or even take a look at it
myself if someone can point me in the right direction.
Jeremy
