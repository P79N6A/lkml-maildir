No, it's due to the fact that someone decided to merge an old version of
the ieee80211 subsystem into Linus' tree:
commit 279385949ebb41ad166fd37505fe552cdb74ed59
Author: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>
Date:   Sun Jun 19 01:27:20 2005 +0200
    [PATCH] bring over ieee80211.h from mainline
    the prototypes and inlines aren't actually needed, but let's not diverge
    from -mm too far.
This version of the ieee80211 subsystem is incompatible with current
ipw2100/ipw2200 drivers and break the compilation of these.
Sincerely,
Brix
