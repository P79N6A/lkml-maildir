clear_queue_full has a wmb() in my patch, and queue_full has a rmb(), I
thought that covered these cases?  I'd rather remove those though, since
the spot you point out is the only place done outside the
io_request_lock.

I don't think we need the extra wake_up (this is in __get_request_wait,
right?), since it gets done by get_request_wait_wakeup()

Once a process waits once, they are allowed to ignore the q->full flag. 
This way existing waiters can make progress even when q->full is set. 
Without the waited check, q->full will never get cleared because the
last writer wouldn't proceed until the last writer was gone.  I had to
make __get_request for the same reason.
