ok, i have uploaded the -rt8 patch, which has the ktimer debugging code 
included again. Could you give it a try and see whether there are any 
debugging messages happening at the same time the keys repeat?
the debugging code checks for two things:
 1) is the monotonic clock truly monotonic (ktimers rely on this). Your 
    previous debug messages never indicated this, but it can happen on 
    other boxes so i kept it for completeness.
 2) if a timer finishes 'early' then we assume it was due to a
    user-signal - double-check that this is in fact true. [timer
    programming bugs can cause early returns for other reasons, which
    can result in bogus -ERESTARTBLOCK error codes fed to userspace,
    confusing it.]
