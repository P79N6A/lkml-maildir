Ok. I will remove this entire comment.

Ok. Since we have only one flag (FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE) and we do not want
to declare the default mode (FALLOC_ALLOCATE), we can _just_ have this
flag and remove the other mode too (FALLOC_RESV_SPACE).
Is this what you are suggesting ?

Should we need a header file just to declare one flag - i.e.
FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE (since now there is no point of declaring the two
modes) ? If "linux/fs.h" is not a good place, will "asm-generic/fcntl.h"
be a sane place for this flag ?
Thanks!
