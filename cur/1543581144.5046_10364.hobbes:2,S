Forgot to mention: I have line
REGISTER	vcc/a*		PERMISSIONS root.vcsa   rw-rw----
REGISTER	vcc/[0-9]	PERMISSIONS root.tty	rw-rw----
in /etc/devfsd.conf (to change permissions for vcc/* as I don't want to make
some applications suid root)
So perhaps after logout current of vcc/[0-9] is reregistered, but sometimes
devfsd suceeds to try to change permissions before the new node is created
and stat() fails (ENOENT) in action_permissions(), as result unpached 
devfsd-1.3.11 exits with error message. Adding code to retry stat() after 
some small delay (usleep(1000)) workarounds problem.
I'm including full /etc.devfsd in attachment.
