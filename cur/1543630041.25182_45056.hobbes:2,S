Ditch isapnp and those config files. If using Red Hat,
add "nopnp" to the kernel command line. Configure your
kernel (2.4.xx or 2.5.xx) to handle ISA PnP by itself.

Blame your motherboard. Many 486 motherboards have
trouble with DMA. I've had similar problems with a
real SoundBlaster16 and a "486". (IBM BlueLightning
486SLC2-66, Intel 486SX-25, and Intel DX4-75 OverDrive)
DOS DOOM played in DOS     --> crash
DOS DOOM in an OS/2 window --> OK
Linux with 8-bit sounds    --> OK
Linux with 16-bit sounds   --> crash
Forget about sound, junk the box, or use OS/2.
