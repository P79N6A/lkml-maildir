No, it isn't. V4L1_COMPAT gets a userspace request, using the obsoleted
V4L1 API and converts into a V4L2 call to be handled by a V4L2 driver. 
All radio stuff at kernel are still using the old obsoleted V4L1 API,
and requires some changes to be V4L2 compliant. The correct fix is to
replace the old calls to V4L2 calls, and include videodev2.h header
instead of videodev.h.
After those changes, we should move the dependencies to be VIDEO_V4L2,
instead of VIDEO_V4L1.
Cheers, 
Mauro.
