I don't know if this is a regression, I hadn't suspend working before rc7-mm1
(rc7-mm1 is the same), but
X -> kill X -> console (OK)
X -> suspend (2ram) -> resume -> kill X -> black screen (no signal), reboot
stucks at some point after some services are shutted down
X driver: intel (compiled from git)
agp dmesg part:
Linux agpgart interface v0.102
agpgart: suspend/resume problematic: resume with 3D/DRI active may lockup X.Org
on some chipset/BIOS combos (see DEBUG_AGP_PM in intel-agp.c)
Is this what should I try?
agpgart: Detected an Intel G33 Chipset.
agpgart: Detected 8192K stolen memory.
agpgart: AGP aperture is 256M @ 0xd0000000
[drm] Initialized drm 1.1.0 20060810
