This uses debugfs for the user interface, but the
per-task-delay-accounting-*.patch series from Balbir creates an extensible
netlink-based system for passing instrumentation results back to userspace.
Can this code be converted to use those netlink interfaces, or is Balbir's
approach unsuitable, or hasn't it even been considered, or what?
