OK.  Please do the smbfs one as well.  That's an outright
race with truncate now.  Because we took the lru_cache_del()
out of truncate_complete_page() in the rmap merge. 
And we took the lru_cache_del() out of truncate_complete_page()
because, err, I forget.  There was a situation in which the page
could still be mapped into process pagetables, and the lru_cache_del()
would have left it unswappable until process exit.
Rik, can you remember the exact scenario?
