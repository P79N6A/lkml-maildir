Someone told me that they found the ATI driver to get along fine with 
the VESA framebuffer driver, but I never tried it.  Since I have a 9000, 
enough of its features are supported by Mesa that I don't care, so I 
switched back.
Also, I have used ATI's drivers with Red Hat 9, and since Red Hat always 
just uses the VGA text console, it was never a problem.
Have you tried the plain 80x25 CGA/EGA/VGA character mode with the ATI 
drivers?  Don't use a graphical console driver at all and see what happens.
ATI won't help you if you contact them, but there may be some value in 
you contacting them with a report of the problem.  I did that.  If they 
get enough complaints, maybe they'll deal with it.
I suspect there is a conflict between X and radeonfb both trying to 
access the drawing engine at the same time.
