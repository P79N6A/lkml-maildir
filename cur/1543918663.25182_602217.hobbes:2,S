Hi Vivek,
Thank you for your comment. :-)
I don't mind kdb and kdump problem now. Because my patches are not merged into
mainline kernel yet. If they are merged, I think how we can resolve about RAS
tools problem.

I tried to implement it, but its impact is large. And we can get all priority
values using "ls" and "cat */priority". I'll implement it if user strongly
expects it.
ex)
# cd panic_notifier_list
# ls
ipmi_msghandler  ipmi_wdog
# cat */priority
200
150
