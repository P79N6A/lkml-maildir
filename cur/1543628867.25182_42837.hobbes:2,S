either from this line [reliably when using pciirq.12 from 
http://www.brodo.de/english/pub/acpi/pci_irq/
 on], or a dmesg | grep IOAPIC 
should show something... your system uses a PIC, though.

A problem either in the ACPI tables, in the parsing code or in the 
higer-level stuff. Probably the first... but could you please re-try the next 
acpi-release, and if it doesn't work then, re-send this bug report? The 
function the error occurs in is completely re-written, so things might 
(hopefully) change. Thanks.

Thanks - or wait for the next acpi-release.
