If you don't mind writing hardware dependent code...
To determine whether you have a bad SIMM I would suggest before the
OS boots. Try writing a set of bits to the address to each SIMM and
then reading them back. Normal sets would be something like:
"0000", "0001", .... "1111". This can take anywhere from a few minutes
to close to an hour depending on the amount of physical memory in
your system.
I hate to say this, but basicly this is what Sun does on all
of their systems with the OpenBootProm code in C for hardware
verification and Forth before you even see the prompt depending
on what is set...
