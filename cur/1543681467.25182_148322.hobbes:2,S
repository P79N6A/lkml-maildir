I see exactly the same thing with my Sound Blaster 16 PCI.
Output of lspci:
02:06.0 Multimedia audio controller: Ensoniq 5880 AudioPCI (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Ensoniq Creative Sound Blaster AudioPCI128
        Flags: bus master, slow devsel, latency 96, IRQ 18
        I/O ports at 3400 [size=64]
        Capabilities: [dc] Power Management version 1
I'm also CCing alsa-devel, but I'm not on the list, hopefully a
moderator will pick this up though.
