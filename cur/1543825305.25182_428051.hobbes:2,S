It's a bit light on descriptions at the moment :-(  as I keep putting 
that in the "do later" bin.

OK.  I've tried very hard to make the scheduling code orthogonal to 
everything else and it essentially separates out the scheduling within a 
CPU from other issues e.g. load balancing.  This separation is 
sufficiently good for me to have merged PlugSched with an earlier 
version of CKRM's CPU management module in a way that made each of 
PlugSched's schedulers available within CKRM's infrastructure.  (CKRM 
have radically rewritten their CPU code since then and I haven't 
bothered to keep up.)
The key point that I'm trying to make is that I would expect PlugSched 
and namespaces to coexist without any problems.  How it integrates with 
the "advanced" scheduling system would depend on how that system alters 
things such as load balancing and/or whether it goes for scheduling 
outcomes at a higher level than the task.
I'm assuming that you're happy to wait for the next release?  That will 
improve the likelihood of descriptions in the patches :-).
