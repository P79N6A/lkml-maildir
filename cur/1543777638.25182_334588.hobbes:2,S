Hi
i have a very strange bug on my system.
i have 2 3com ethernet cards, bridged.
I wrote some iptable rules on the bridge interface, and they work
perfectly, all but one!
i've this rule in a bash script, starting when a ppp0 connection starts
IPT=iptables
$IPT -A INPUT -s 172.16.92.101 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit
--limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
$IPT -A FORWARD -s 172.16.92.101 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m
limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
$IPT -A INPUT -s 172.16.92.102 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit
--limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
$IPT -A FORWARD -s 172.16.92.102 -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m
limit --limit 1/s -j ACCEPT
it seems not to work.
but if i destroy completly my tables and manually restart the script it
works!!
i'm using 2.6.13-rc3 and iptables 1.3.2, but i got this problem with
2.6.11 and .12 too 
and with iptables 1.2.x
what's wrong?
