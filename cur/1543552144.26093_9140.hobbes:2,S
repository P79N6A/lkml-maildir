AFAIK, AGP is just a preferent PCI slot in the PCI bus; that is for you can
only have ONE AGP port on a PCI bus. If all were AGP ports, you will have
a new-reinvented-ultra-fast-pci-bus. It is fast because it is special, just
for that. In linux, lspci -v lists also your AGP card, doesn't it ?
Please, could an expert point to the AGP standard defs ?
