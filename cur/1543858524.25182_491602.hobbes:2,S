Good idea - whatever "porting" means. There are lots of Windows drivers out there
that are also partly user space using that Kithara stuff. They have most of their
driver in a dll. So that is similar to what we want with UIO - except that we 
handle interrupts in a clean way, they don't.
If you need to port such a driver, simply writing a kernel module and a user space
library would change so much of the concept that you can start rewriting it from
scratch. And you'll have a large kernel module to maintain. OK, the guru/company
can earn money with it, at least as long as the customer doesn't realize it is
not the best solution for him.
