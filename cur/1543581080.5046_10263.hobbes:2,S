I don't think that there is much useful that I could look at, thanks.

On second thoughts, this doesn't need to be SMP related.  I don't know
much about "bottom halves" but I gather that they get run after an
interrupt has been handled and interrupts have been re-enabled, but
before the original process is rescheduled.  If this is the case, then
the "_bh" part of the "spin_lock_bh" (which does a local_bh_disable)
could be the bit that is important on a UP system.
