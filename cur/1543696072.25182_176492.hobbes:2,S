At HZ=200, it would take a while to notice. I used adjtimexconfig, 
which counts the number of kernel ticks which occur in 70 seconds 
(according to the RTC). The RTC is pretty stable without power 
management, so I tend to trust it. I think I ended up with a value of 
tick=11000 (compensation for a 10% slow clock), and if I left the 
machine idle, ntpd would converge based on the new tick value.
Then again, I don't think I tried HZ>=200 on -test9. (When I got Pasi's 
-test9 patch, I applied it to a -test8-bk kernel with HZ=1000-- I don't 
remember exactly which one.) Based on his followup email, timekeeping 
may be better in -test9. I'll check.

The slowness on my system is supposedly related to ECC initialization, 
but it's only ~30 seconds for 512MB. Still, if I upgrade the memory, 
that's a good tip.

Correct.
