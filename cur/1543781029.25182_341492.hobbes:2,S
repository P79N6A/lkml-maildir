Dear Lennart,
I have an update on this. Please see the message indented inline.

I do NOT have one. I am getting it today.  I will work on it this
weekend?

I dumped the 0th sector of SD when formatted on 
	1) CAM &
	2) Windows
The partition table exists on both.
But, the Master Boot Code is NOT present on the CAM formatted SD but is
available on windows formatted SD card.
Can you comment on the Master Boot Code? What is it required on Linux
HOW does windows managed without it? I mean how is Windows able to mount
the SD?
My driver does NOT support partitions? I mean I have implemented it as
alloc_disk(1) & relative first_minor chage obviously.
Is it why I am NOT able to mount the CAM formatted device?
Is this a problem?
Thanks & Regards,
Mukund Jampala
