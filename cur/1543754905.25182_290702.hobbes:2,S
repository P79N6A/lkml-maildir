This is a bug in libps2, that's been fixed and submitted for 2.6.11.
Your keyboard should work again with 2.6.11, if the fix makes it there.
If a keyboard doesn't report the ID on a GETID command, ps2_command
should fail.
Old AT keyboards don't know the GETID command but at least they know
the SETLEDS command, which is how they're identified.
As a temporary workaround you can use atkbd.dumbkbd=1, which will cause
your LEDs not to work as a side effect, though.

We don't need to check the values, since the ps2_command will return an
error when the bug in libps2 is fixed.
