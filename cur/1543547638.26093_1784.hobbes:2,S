I spend my time thinking. But I prefer to spend it thinking about the bug
not about finding it and how long fsck takes. There are only a few things I
think Linus is a complete loon about 8) but the debugging stuff is one.
Things like GUI source level kernel debugging, nice graphs of things like
cache line reloads between two points and run time spinlock deadlock 
validation and lock tracking (the last one is on my todo list only right now)
are rather useful
