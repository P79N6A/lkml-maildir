Hi Tom.
I have revisited this and have made a successfull kernel build on a
windows/cygwin box now.
I had to change two things only:
1) The -lintl workaround was fixed by introducing a little script.
   If gcc cannot link a program that sues gettext then NLS is disabled.
2) Elf32_Section and Elf64_Section was replaced by Elfnn_Half
The build succeeds with a number of warnings that I just ignored.
fixdep and friends always get rebuild because kbuild does
not know about the .exe suffix so it does not
see that the binaries exists.
This is annoying and I hope to fix it before the merge.
These change will hit mainline during next merge window
so it will take a while before you can benefit.
For now they are in the kbuild.git tree at git.kernel.org
and will soon be part of -mm.
	Sam
