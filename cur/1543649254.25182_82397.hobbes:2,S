Please re-read Christoph's message -- the request was made because RMS 
simply has never posted a single on-topic message.  By that measure he 
could easily and quite rightly be labelled a spammer...
That said, _because_ it can easily be thought of as censorship, I -DO 
NOT- think that RMS should be blacklisted by the mail admins from lkml.
Killfiled?  Yes.  Blacklisted, no.
