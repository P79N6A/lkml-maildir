That's such a nice idea that there's already one :)
It's linux-kernel-announce@vger (I think) but it doesn't seem to
have been getting the 2.2pre series information.
Yes, it would also be nice if Alan's patches were announced there,
although that's not so urgent, as the vger backlog seems to have
cleared nicely.
