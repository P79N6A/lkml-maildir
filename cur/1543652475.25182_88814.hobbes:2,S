Note that this is not a kernel related question. The * in the command line is 
expanded into a list of all entries in the current directory, which results 
in a command line longer than allowed. Try this instead:
find -maxdepth 1 -print0 | \
	xargs -0 --replace=% cp -f % /usr/local/www/images
--Andreas.
