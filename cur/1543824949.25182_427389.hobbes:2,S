Just in case the news didn't get through: the issue has been fixed in 
-mm3. I'm not sure about what the real fix was, since
  - rc4 is working
  - rc4-mm1 is not working
  - rc4-mm2 is not working
  - rc4-mm3 is working
Mel Gorman sent me the zonesizing-v13 patch for -mm3 (thanks again!), 
which was also working, results are here:

Thanks to all involved,
Christian.
