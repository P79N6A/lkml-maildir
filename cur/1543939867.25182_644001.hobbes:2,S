Yes, I think so too. Thank you for your comments. I will work them into
the patchset and run some larger tests on it next week (test with many
kinds of guests and some stress testing) to be sure that there are no
regressions. I would like to enable NPT per default when the patchset
is merged. I will post a new version of the patchset maybe on Thursday
or Friday.
