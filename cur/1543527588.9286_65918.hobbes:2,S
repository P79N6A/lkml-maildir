How about 0?

The readdir() walk of /proc for process information.  A little organization
isn't a bad thing. (Or do you prefer the old flat file system of older MacOS)

chroot() is prevent programs from messing things up accidentally.  For a
targeted attack, once root access is attained, there's not much one cannot
do.  And you cannot re-mount an already mounted partition.  (I just tried
with proc unmounted and mtab erased.) [I think we will all agree there's
no stopping root from doing something.]
