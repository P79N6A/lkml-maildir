BTW, Dave, if it's only about one such "second class" here, then it
shouldn't be so hard to try this one more level of nesting. I think,
the real problem for lockdep starts when there are more such "second
classes", but it's probably in another place.
You could also have a look at e.g. enum_inode_i_mutex_lock_class in
include/linux/fs.h and fh_lock_nested() in include/linux/nfsd/nfsfh.h,
and maybe define similar enum for this.
