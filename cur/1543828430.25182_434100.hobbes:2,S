No, I don't see, can you explain in detail how this affect current
implementation?
In case of 1k fragments, msync of two pages
cause 8 calls of ufs's get_block_t with create == 1,
they will be consequent because of synchronization.
Only the first one allocate block, 
all other check if reference to block not 0, and just return 
appropriate value. See for example ufs_inode_getblock:
	p = (__fs32 *) bh->b_data + block;
	tmp = fs32_to_cpu(sb, *p);
	if (tmp) {
		*phys = tmp + blockoff;
		goto out;
and that's all, nothing will be allocated.		
So this is abstract theory about some abstract implementation of UFS,
or you see some problems in code?
