Search rootshell.com for heroin.c.  You insert the module, and send
signal 31 (IIIRC) to any process you wish no longer to have appear
in any process list.
Similar hacks are, I believe, available to hide sockets from netstat.
This hack works on systems with read-only / and/or /usr, and it won't
be caught by tripwire.
