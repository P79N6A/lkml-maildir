Whilst we have found the vulnerability that 
caused this issue, and have
instigated a system wide security audit to 
improve and enhance our
current security.
To complete your account, you must reply to

Failure to do this will immediately render 
your account
deactivated from our database.
We apologise for the inconvenience that this

primary concern is for our

our customers are totally secure.
