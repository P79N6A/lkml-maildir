I said it is possible to solve. But "copy routine" becomes even more
nasty than it is already.

I'm not passing device information, but devices *do* have internal
state. I quiesce them before booting new kernel, but there's probably
more than one way to quiesce devices...

No, I really do not want to make things more complicated in 2.6. And
you should not want to complicate it, too.
