Let me be clear here. A lot of laptop video hardware does not have a
video ROM. Therefore you can not enable the BAR and read it from an
assigned address since there is no ROM to be read.  Instead the video
ROM images are compressed and stored inside the system BIOS ROM. The
location of the image is not a public thing.  At boot time the
compressed video ROM is expanded out of the system ROM into shadow RAM
at C000:0. There is no real ROM there, it is only a copy in RAM. If
you lose that copy the only way to get it back is to reset the
machine. The ROM code already in the kernel knows about these shadow
copies and won't mess them up.
