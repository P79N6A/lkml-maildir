Actually, the breakage I was talking about got fixed in _my_ tree.
I'd love for the -mm tree to get more testing, but it doesn't.

I don't know about "any", but yeah.

A large part of it is psychological. On the other hand, it may be that
Neil is right and it would just mean that people wouldn't even test the
odd releases (..because they want to wait a couple of weeks for the even
one), so it may not actually end up helping much.
The thing is, I _do_ believe the current setup is working reasonably well.  
But I also do know that some people (a fairly small group, but anyway)  
seem to want an extra level of stability - although those people seem to
not talk so much about "it works" kind of stability, but literally a "we
can't keep up" kind of stability (ie at least a noticeable percentage of
that group is not complaining about crashes, they are complaining about
speed of development).
And I suspect that _anything_ I do won't make those people happy.
