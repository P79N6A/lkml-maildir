I'm not sure either; at this point I *might* consider doing
it differently -- but primarily for the case of external GPIO
chips, e.g. over I2C or SPI -- where errors are realistic.  But
it's been this way for a few years now, and changing stuff
that hasn't been observed to be a problem isn't on my list.
But as I noted:  patches for $SUBJECT don't seem to have any
reason not to report whatever faults they encounter.
Also worth remembering:  when reading a GPIO value, it's not
so easy to "ignore" a tristate (0, 1, error) return value.

If I had to do that, I'd *certainly* want to bang the hardware
designer over the head with some sort of cluebat or cluebrick.  :(

It should now be realistic for I2C device drivers to have
fault recovery logic...
But for a long time, I2c only returned -EPERM so it was
completely hopeless trying to figure out how to "handle"
any problem beyond logging the problem and hoping someone
is watching syslog output.  That's a big part of why most
current I2C drivers have such unfriendly fault handling.
