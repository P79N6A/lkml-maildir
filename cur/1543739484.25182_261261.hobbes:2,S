Don't you have to adjust poll/select as well, to test whether read has
any data to return immediately?  Squid is broken with the latest
FCdevel kernel, and this patch is in it.
The reason Squid breaks is that poll (or is it select? I forget) says
there's data to be read from cache files (as well as from error
message files read during start up), but then read fails with -EAGAIN.
If I bring the error files into memory with cat
/etc/squid/errors/ERR*, then squid will successfully start up, and
then, in order for it to not eat all the available CPU polling data
files and attempting to read from them, I need to start a command line
this:
pid=`pidof '(squid)'
while :; do
  lsof -p $pid |
  sed -n 's,.*\(/var/spool/squid/.*/.*/.*\),\1,p' |
  xargs cat /dev/null > /dev/null;
  sleep 5
done
