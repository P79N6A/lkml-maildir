One *big* question that you don't address at all in your mail:
Do you need *real time* tracking of changes/etc, in which case inotify or
something based on it are probably an approach to follow (note that I don't
think inotify currently deals with read-only access to a file).
Or do you not care about real-time tracking, but have a requirement to be
able to go back and say "Oh, at 9:03:38.99342 last Tuesday, user XYZ
tried to open this file" - if that's what you want, you probably want to
look at the audit subsystem and its support for syscall auditing.
