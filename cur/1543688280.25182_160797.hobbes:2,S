                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^_______ Yes!
There was lots of discussion/flames back-and-forth with newbies
requiring that modules be written in C++.  This is what you get.
Some of the C++ built-ins are not even global so the linker
won't be able to find them if they are used. It's not just
a matter of emulating 'new'. Parameter-passing 'by reference' also
won't work so putting 'C' wrappers around stuff like they do
in Dr. Jobbs and C/C++ Journal isn't going to work inside
the kernel where there is no support.
Cheers,
