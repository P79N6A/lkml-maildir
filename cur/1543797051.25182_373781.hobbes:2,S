Sorry, thought the log from Xorg was quite selfexplaining
Xorg jumps to VT7, you see a console cursor, "_", at the top left corner 
and thats it. It's impossible to change back to VT1 (or any other), the 
only thing that works is to press [stop]-[a] so that you get back to the
OBP from where I can reset the machine (resetting by the reset button 
don't work). It's still possible to ssh to the machine, more and dmesg is 
possible, but running ps causes the machine to completly lock up, change 
init mode don't give any affects att all and trying to turn off or kill X 
results in the same as ps.
When running in plain console (without trying to run X) everything works 
fine (just telling that so I won't get people to ask if ps segfaults in 
other cases or claims that my init is broke and so on).
