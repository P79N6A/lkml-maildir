With the complete size reduction struct hrtimer becomes 32 bytes on 32 
bits archs and so we can fit the basic hrtimer into one or two cache 
lines.
container_of() is becoming more and more common in the kernel, so I don't 
know who asked, it's not that difficult to use. I agree it makes simple 
test modules a bit more difficult, but so far the more common case is that 
this structure is embedded in other structures and container_of() creates 
simpler code. Additionally you get type checking for free, which you don't 
get with a void pointer.
bye, Roman
