Good.

kernel/suspend.c; it puts all processes to refrigerator so there's

No.. I guess you are right. Trouble is that I can reproduce data
corruption without patch and can no longer reproduce anything with it.

Too bad I do not have any of these :-(. Yes bad things are going to
happen when suspending with these active.
