One problem is that for example do_dbs_timer() [used both in the 
cpufreq_ondemand and cpufreq_conservative cpufreq drivers] gets queued 
into the generic kevent workqueue via schedule_work(). But work_on_cpu() 
needs to serialize on the worklet - i.e. it needs to do a flush_work() - 
and does this with the cpufreq lock held.
So we have a 'worklet inversion' bug here - and this got reported as a 
hard to debug boot hang on some systems.
The root cause is that kevents is not that do_dbs_timer() uses 
schedule_work() - the root cause is that kevents workqueue is a too 
generic workqueue that is the union of all casual workqueue users in the 
kernel. That is fine (and it is its purpose) but it should not be used for 
core kernel facilities such as work_on_cpu() - precisely because doing so 
would limit that facility's genericity.
This bug was always there but dormant until work_on_cpu() was used from a 
deep enough codepath.
So the solution here is to isolate work_on_cpu()s mechanisms from the 
'misc' workqueue that schedule_work() deals with - this is what Rusty's 
patch does.
Your observation about there being too many workqueue threads is correct 
but this commit is IMO a valid use of the workqueue facility. This 
workqueue it only gets created on CONFIG_SMP so there cost is about ~10K 
RAM per CPU.
I also agree that the commit should have included this description.
