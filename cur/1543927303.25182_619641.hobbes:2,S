Does the machine recover afterward, or is the memory freed up after
the OOM kill? How about if you kill X and do a sysrq+E then sysrq+I
(to kill all tasks)?
If the memory still isn't freed after that, then we could have a
kernel memory leak.

OK, yes this is a different case, and it is very far off the OOM
killing stage. Atomic allocations can fail quite easily, but
kswapd will have started up and will start freeing memory.
Actually there are some patches gone into 2.6.24 that have fixed
some corner cases with the network stack making order-1 allocations
when it should be order-0. That might help your atomic allocation
failures, but they aren't really a bug anyway (unless networking
fails to recover).
Thanks for reporting all this...
