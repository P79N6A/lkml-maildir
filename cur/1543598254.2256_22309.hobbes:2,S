is really good here (compared to 2.4.8/2.4.9). I switched from plain 
2.4.8/2.4.9 because it seems the new used-once is nonfunctional on my 
machine. (playing high-quality wav-files for 5 minutes is enough to make my 
system totally unresponsible for a few 10's of seconds (its swapping my 
desktop back in then)).
thanks !
