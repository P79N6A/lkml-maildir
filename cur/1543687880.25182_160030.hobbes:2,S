Well if the buffers are dynamic, why would they want to be allocated
using the consistent interface?

If sound drivers set the dma_mask to something and expect that to
apply to the consistent allocations, then they aren't complying with
the current API and needs to be fixed.

So fix it on ia32 to respect that mask for consistent allocations,
problem solved.
