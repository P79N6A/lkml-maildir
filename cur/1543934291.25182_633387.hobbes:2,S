To be honest, I must mention that the load that did that was a kernel
build -j5 on a dual socket Athlon MP box. With a current kernel and XFS
that load is making the box slow but its still very servicable.

I doubt it.

I tried a quick conversion of reiser3 at the time, but it really wants a
recursive lock and I couldn't be bothered to fix a 'legacy' filesystem
so I just gave up and converted the filesystem to XFS.
