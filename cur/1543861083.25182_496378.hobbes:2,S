I like this.  It feels a bit awkward, and creating a bunch of duplicate
functions is "messy", but I can't think of any other way to achive this.
Your writeup in this message is also quite good, care to add it to the
Documentation/ directory in the kernel?

Unless anyone objects, I'll add the first 6 patches here to my tree for
testing in -mm for a bit.
Hm, but I guess without the follow-up patches for libata, it will not
really get tested much.  Jeff, if I accept this, what's your feelings of
letting libata be the "test bed" for it?
