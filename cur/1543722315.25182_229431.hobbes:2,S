What do you need exactly ? The TB one or the core one ? the core
I suppose ? Well, we should probably define an ppc_get_cpu_core_frequency
or something like that that uses the cpufreq callback like the pmac code
when cpufreq is enabled or default to the old parsing when not. Look at
the pmac code. You may also want to install a cpufreq notifier callback
to be informed of core frequency changes.
Ben.
