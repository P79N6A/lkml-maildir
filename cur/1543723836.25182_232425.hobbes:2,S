In Linux, a cardbus driver is exactly the same as a regular PCI driver.
There is no difference.  You get all the resources (device BARs) and
interrupts from the pci device structure, just like a regular PCI
driver.
There's no need to fiddle with the cardbus bridge at all.  In fact,
we'll scream at you if you attempt to do that because its a violation
of the system layering.
