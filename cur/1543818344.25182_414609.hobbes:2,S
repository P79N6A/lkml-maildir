Ok... so I guess I jumped to the wrong conclusion. Thanks for
straightening me out.
But it is behaving like edge-triggered..
So I have explored about the i8259 (wikipedia helped) and discovered
the ELCR (Edge/Level Control Register).  Apparently this is meant to
be set up by the BIOS to the correct values.  It seems that this isn't
happening. 
It seems to get the value 0x0800 which corresponds to IRQ11 being the
only level-triggered interrupt.  But I need IRQ10 to be level
triggered.  I hacked the code to set the 0x0400 bit, and it seems to
work OK without my other patch.
Now I just need a way to set this correctly at boot time without a
hack.
I currently have Linux compiled without ACPI support (as I don't
really want that and being an oldish notebook I gather it has a good
chance of causing problems) so that isn't fiddling with the ELCR.
So thank you for helping me a step further in understand, but now I
have a new question:
 How can I make sure the ELCR is set correctly?
and I guess,
 What is the correct setting?
My /proc/interrupts is below.
Thanks.
