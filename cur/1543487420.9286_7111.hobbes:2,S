Larry et al,
What Larry is describing is PRECISELY what happened to Apple's Copland OS
(also called the "real" MacOS 8).  There was no manager who was willing to
say NFW when people wanted to add any random lame feature to the system.
This effect, along with other management (NOT technical) stupidity, KILLED
the project.  I worked hard on the project for more than three years .  It
was a technically brilliant operating system.  Creeping featurism killed it.
I believe this is very likely the reason Micro$oft W2K is very very late as
well (more's the pity, eh?).
In similar situations I have been involved in, the guy who said "no" as Linus
does has been termed an "asshole".  But in fact the projects got done more or
less on time and they did not suck.  Also in fact, the guy who said "no" was
really a reasonably good guy who had a hard job to do.  Just like Linus.
One other observation: Linus may say NO, but he is very willing to be
persuaded.  You just have to do your analysis and be persuasive.  While this
may leave out some features championed only by someone who is not gifted with
the powers of persuasion, perhaps that's reasonable: Sometimes features don't
get in because they aren't wanted by badly enough by enough people to get
someone who IS so gifted fired up to make Linus (or whoever) change his mind
after the initial NO.
I strongly concur with Larry.

Never pour concrete until you have planned what goes on top in detail. Its
very embarrasing trying to put a square house and a round foundation, however
firm. - [the illustrious Alan Cox on the linux-kernel mailing list]
