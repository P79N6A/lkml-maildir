Hi Justin,
I tracked the problem down and I find that the following change between
versions 6.2.4 and 6.2.5 causes system freeze:
--- aic7xxx/aic7xxx_core.c      Wed Apr 17 14:36:21 2002
+++ aic7xxx.new/aic7xxx_core.c  Mon Mar 18 12:54:23 2002

                ahc_delay(1000);

        if (wait == 0) {
                printf("%s: WARNING - Failed chip reset!  "
All other changes were successfully merged without any problems.
BTW, version 6.2.6 of the driver from 2.4.19-pre7 freezes the system too.
Regards,
Andrey.
