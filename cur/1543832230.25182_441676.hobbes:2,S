Hi,
I have been playing around with IPv6 flow labels on UDP under Linux.
When using flow labels on a socket, I seem unable to set the per-hop
options header on a per-packet basis. It works if I set the per-hop
options header while acquiring the flow label from the kernel. I am
wondering if Linux enforces the following from Appendix A of RFC2460:
"
   All packets belonging to the same flow must be sent with the same
   source address, destination address, and flow label.  If any of those
   packets includes a Hop-by-Hop Options header, then they all must be
   originated with the same Hop-by-Hop Options header contents
   (excluding the Next Header field of the Hop-by-Hop Options header).
"
Does anyone know if that is the case?
Regards,
Paul Fleischer
