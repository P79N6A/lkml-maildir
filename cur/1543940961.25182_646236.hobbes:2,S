Unfortunately, not.
For information, reverting just the first part of the offending commit
(sl->timer.cb_mode) fixed the problem, while reverting only the second
part (if (!hrtimer_active(&t->timer))) had no effect.
Also, I found a trivially reproductible testcase : sleep 0.
It hangs in nanosleep({0, 0}).
