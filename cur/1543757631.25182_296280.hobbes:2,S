I can second that. I had the same experience this weekend on a 
md/dm/reiserfs setup. The funny thing is that e.g. find reports I/O 
errors but if you then run tar on the tree you eventually get the 
correct data from tar. Then run find again and you'll again get I/O errors.

You need to run 'reiserfsck --rebuild-tree' and see what happens :-(

I don't think so - I changed from reiserfs to ext3 without changing the 
underlying dm/raid5 and this seems to work properly.
I can furthermore state that reiserfs without dm/md does work correctly 
as I use reiserfs on a ieee1394 backup disk (that saved me from terrible 
trouble).
Currently I can only warn to not use reiserfs with dm/md on 2.6.
