http://ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk/~weejock/cap-rawio-fixes.diff
has a stack of them.  Quite a few apply to IDE code, though I
couldn't promise that I caught the dangerous one in this case.
It's against an old kernel though.  If it's considered worthwhile,
I shall re-audit a recent 2.3 (and maybe 2.2) for the ADMINs which
should probably be RAWIOs.
Matthew.
