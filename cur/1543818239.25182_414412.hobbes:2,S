zap_process() disables irqs while traversing ->thread_group list.
So yes, if a process has a lot of threads it will be a latency regression.
(but again, __group_complete_signal() does the same while delivering this
signal, so I don't think this change can make things worse).
However this allows us to avoid tasklist_lock in zap_threads() so I think
it is worth it. Please note that tasklist_lock was held while iterating
over _all_ threads in system, not only current's thread group.
Oleg.
