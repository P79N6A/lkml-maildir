Basically I need to get off my butt and send Alan and Bero some updates...
Latest patches against mainline (2.4.22-bkXX and 2.6.0-testX-bkXX) are 
always posted at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/libata/
  and the 
latest Fedora Core (what used to be Red Hat Linux) supports it out of 
the box as well.
It does take a bit of potentially non-trivial hand merging to patch 
successfully into -ac tree... :(
