The SLIM security module, which is trying to get upstream, uses at least
i_security and f_security.
The Argus module supposedly being submitted "soon" which is used in
their LSPP product, surely must use them all.
Maybe you still want to make these CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX until the
other modules are upstreamed, but I just wanted to make sure you knew
other modules, trying to get upstream, are using them.
Personally I'd say these are a core part of the LSM framework, and if
you don't want LSM, compile it out.  But since I realize that using only
capabilities must be a pretty common case, how about just adding a
config option CONFIG_SECURITY_OBJFIELDS, which is auto-enabled with
SELINUX and default off, which hides these fields instead?
Patch should be trivial, and I can aim to send one tomorrow.
