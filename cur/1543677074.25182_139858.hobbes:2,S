Hi,
The ACPI subsystem can be today (from a driver point of view) in 
three configurations: not compiled (CONFIG_ACPI=n), compiled and 
running or compiled and disabled (with acpi=off).
A driver which wants to use some ACPI exported routines (in my
case it's the sonypi driver which wants to use ec_read/ec_write),
needs to know exactly what the ACPI state is.
The only way to do this today (from what I've seen) is to do:
#ifdef CONFIG_ACPI
	if (!acpi_disabled)
		return ec_write(addr, value);
#endif
	return my_ec_emulated_write(...);
This way on doing things needs however that the 'acpi_disabled' 
variable be exported to modules.
Please apply the attached patch or advise on a better way to know
if ACPI is enabled or not (patch generated against the today 2.5 BK
tree).
Thanks,
Stelian.
