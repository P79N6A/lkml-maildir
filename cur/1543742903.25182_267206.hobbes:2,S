As I mentioned, this is a problem with RH9; you might not want to take
this further.  :-)

No patches.  I downloaded 2.6.9 again last night and applied the
2.6.10-rc1 patch with ketchup-0.8.1.  The downloaded 2.6.9 and my previous
version created by ketchup had no differences.
I avoided a 2.6.10-rc1 problem by hand copying usr/initramfs_list to
../out.router.20041030/usr

Yes, that avoided the problem too.

Attached is the ide-dma.s with "Optimize for size" on.
