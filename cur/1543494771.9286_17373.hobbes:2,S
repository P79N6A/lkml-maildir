Greetings,
I understand that the __init/__initfunc macros expand to a compiler
directive which mark the function in an ELF header section which allows the
kernel to jettison the code after it's run..  This is correct?
If so, I am trying to understand why this nifty feature is not used in many
drivers within 2.2.6.  Is this just because the author has not yet taken
advantage of this option, or because there are subtle reasons why it cannot
be used in some circumstances?  If the latter, I'd like to better
understand those reasons. :-)
thanks,
-bp
