Posting patches is generally a good thing (IMHO). Gziping them
is just plain ugly (also IMHO).
On the other hand very big patches that do nothing else then
moving files around (like my patch) don't really have to be posted
to lkml. If I hadn't overssen the size of this patch, I would
probably have put it on ftp.
My apologies
