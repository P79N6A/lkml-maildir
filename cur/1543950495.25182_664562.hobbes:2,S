Hi Alex,
The x3950 M2 on which the earlier reported Oops (invalid opcode
while in acpi_ev_notify_dispatch) reproduced is unfortunately still
tied up because of a customer critical project.
I have been able to try these new patches on a single node
x3850 [2 hotpluggable PCI-X slots, 4 hotpluggable PCIe slots]
and a 2 node x3950 [12 total (6/node) hotpluggable PCI-X slots]
and found no problems.
Gary
