Subject: Read-Copy Update mutual exclusion for linux

Read-Copy Update is a two-phase mutual exclusion method that can be
used to avoid overhead and code complexity of conventional methods
that use spin-waiting. It uses the event-driven nature of operating
systems to defer exceptional conditions until currently active code
has completed allowing common code paths to proceed without delay.
This technique is potentially useful for maintenance of read-mostly
data structures and unusual situations like module unloading.
An implementation of this based on the original DYNIX/ptx implementation 
is now available for Linux (2.4.1 kernel) at 
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/rclock.html.
Thanks
