This is correct, but...

I read at some time that this optimization existed but was deemed obsolete and 
removed.
Why obsolete? Because... we have tmpfs! And that's the point. With DONTNEED, 
we detach references from page tables, but the content is still pinned: it 
_is_ the "disk"! (And you have TMPDIR on tmpfs, right?)

Btw, on this side of the picture, I think fragmentation avoidance is not 
needed for that.
I guess you refer to using frag. avoidance on the guest (if it matters for the 
host, let me know). When it will be present using it will be nice, but 
currently we'd do madvise() on a page-per-page basis, and we'd do it on 
non-consecutive pages (basically, free pages we either find or free or 
purpose).

I assume not everybody did (even if somebody pointed out the existance of the 
SVr4 API), but there was the need, in at least one usage, for a virtual 
address-based API rather than a file offset based one, like the SVr4 one - 
that user would need implementing backward mapping in userspace only for this 
purpose, while we already have it in the kernel.
Anyway, the sys_punch() API will follow later - customers need mainly 
madvise() for now.
