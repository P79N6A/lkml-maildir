Hello Marcelo,
please apply the following small patch against 2.4 which removes two 
bogus informations from "ioctl-number.txt":
1) The DVD decoder driver was never finished and never released. I 
recently removed these informations from our website -- most of the work 
that was freely available has gone into projects like libdvdread and 
libdvdnav.
2) There never was a "saa7146 driver" from Philips officially. Instead, 
in 2.6. my saa7146 driver was included which drives various analog TV 
cards and various DVB cards through Video4Linux-2.
Thanks!
