In this case your version is indeed more concise.  However, in most of
the other for_each macros having it in the loop conditional looks more
natural.
So in order to be consistent throughout list.h, I'd like to keep the
rcu_dereference in the loop conditional.

I chose to keep it out of prefetch because normally the argument to
prefetch does not have any side-effects.  Even though today's prefetch
is an inline function which does respect side-effects, there is always
a possibility that someone somewhere might decide to implement prefetch
as a macro.
Besides, the expression
i = foo(i)
where foo has side-effects is pretty normal.
Cheers,
