Yes, I see.  What about the fact that device_suspend() locks 
pm_sleep_start_end_mtx first and pm_sleep_rwsem second, whereas 
device_pm_destroy_suspended() locks pm_sleep_start_end_mtx while 
holding pm_sleep_rwsem?  That should produce a lockdep warning.

This suggests another approach, simpler but not as general.  So far all
the problems we've seen have been associated with those CPU notifiers.  
Suppose the notifications about CPUs that failed to come back up were
delayed until after the resume was complete?  Drivers like msr would
then have to check in their resume handler whether the CPU was actually 
up, but no other changes would be needed.
In this way we could fix the immediate problem.  It wouldn't help with 
other sorts of devices that need to be unregistered during a suspend, 
though.

Okay.
