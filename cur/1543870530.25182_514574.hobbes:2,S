Subject: [PATCH] md: Fix for raid6 reshape.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

### Comments for Changeset
Recent patch for raid6 reshape had a change missing that showed up in
subsequent review.
Many places in the raid5 code used "conf->raid_disks-1" to mean
"number of data disks".  With raid6 that had to be changed to
"conf->raid_disk - conf->max_degraded" or similar.  One place was missed.
This bug means that if a raid6 reshape were aborted in the middle the
recorded position would be wrong.  On restart it would either fail (as
the position wasn't on an appropriate boundary) or would leave a section
of the array unreshaped, causing data corruption.
