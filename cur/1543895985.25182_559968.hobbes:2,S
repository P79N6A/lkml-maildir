It does and it doesn't. There is not a reasonable way for a
user to mark an app as needing full self-modifying ability.
It's not like the executable stack, which can be set via the
ELF note markings on the executable. (ELF note markings are
ideal because they can not be used via a ret-to-libc attack)
With admin privs, one can change SE Linux settings. Mark the
executable, disable the protection system-wide, generate a
completely new SE Linux policy, or just turn SE Linux off.
Normally we don't expect/require admin privs to install an
executable in one's own ~/bin directory. This is broken.
It ought to be easier to get a JIT working well without
enabling arbitrary mprotect. This would allow a JIT to
partially benefit from the recent security enhancements.
(think of all the buggy browser-based JIT things!)

I prefer ELF notes (for start-up allocations) and prctl,
plus a mmap flag for per-allocation behavior.

I didn't mean that the default default :-) setting would change.
I meant that people could change the behavior from a boot script.
Things that break are really foul and nasty anyway, probably with
serious problems that ought to get fixed.

Yes, exactly. I think there are some possible optimizations
available too, particularly with the cifs filesystem.

Yes, mdup() and probably mdup2(). It could be mremap flags or not.
JIT emulators generally need a second mapping so that they can
have both read/write and execute for the same physical memory.
It is somewhat tolerable to have SE Linux enforce that the second
mapping be randomized. (it helps security greatly, but slows the
emulator by a tiny bit)

A few mremap flags ought to do the job I think.

Yes. I'm looking for the change that will help JIT emulators
the most while hurting security the least.

Great.

Yes and no. It's painful to be restricted to one backing store.
Covering MAP_ANONYMOUS and SysV shared mem is most critical.
I suppose that other filesystems may require multiple flags to
deal with the desire to (not) punch a hole on disk and what to
do if that isn't possible.
