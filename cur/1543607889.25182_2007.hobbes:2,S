The only issue with the Piccolo controller is that I
don't think it is a PCI device (doesn't show up in
lspci anyway).  It's part of toshiba's integrated
chipset, so I'm not sure exactly how it is accessed. 
I haven't looked at the docs in a while.  Good luck
with it.  I'd love to see DMA working on my laptop.

There are two things that will help you straight away.
The first is the 
Linux Device Drivers book (version 2) - also available
online for 
cheapskates ;) 
The second is Documentation/pci.txt, and
Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt

Another good bit of news is that providing the device
follows standard 
IDE bus mastering design (pretty much all do) then you
only actually have 
to write the tuning code for the chipset. 
ide-pci.c contains a table of PCI capable devices and
any driver needed. 
You provide pci initialisers, dma finctions and ide
functions. 
Take a look at amd74xx.c for example - thats a driver
letting ide-dma.c 
do all the work.
