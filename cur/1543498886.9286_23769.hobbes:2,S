	Not if you are using a remote logging server or a secure log daemon.
A secure log daemon uses cryptographic signatures on the log entries to
make any tampering detectable.  I hate it when the make the claim that
the secure log daemons are tamperproof.  They are not tamper proof.  But
they are tamper detectable.

	No I wouldn't...  It's my business...  I'm the senior researcher
for Internet Security Systems.  :-)
