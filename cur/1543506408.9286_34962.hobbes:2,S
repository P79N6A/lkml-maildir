> Background: in the 2.2/3.x kernels, there seems to be
> the possibility to detach the console from the video-card
> and use, for example, the serial port. If you do this, your
> shiny 8MB matrox millenium will be sitting idle in your
> pc doing nothing but wasting energy.

> The idea: create some driver that uses the RAM of the
> video-card as a block-device! That way you can use the
> fast-accessible videocard memory as a (for example)
> swap-drive (will outperfrom any harddisk!) or a temporary-
> file "disk" or whatsoever. Shouldn't be too difficult to
> implement.

> Any questions/comments/etc.? Please please please
