Subject: Kernel panic (reiserfs), some hangs - bad hardware?.

I have following problems:
1) (looks like )Applications such as oggenc or flac, who mmap() output files and write into mapped memory area, produce corrupted files on my system. ~1 error on 10-100M, resulting file just some bytes different from what program wrote.
Second attempts always removes error (while may cause new one with same proportion)
More errors on intensive IO/bad interface cable, less errors on no other IO/good cable. Tried 2.6.7 vanilla kernel.
Am i crazy?
2) With bad interface cable, my system used to just hang. With better?/40pin cable, it do this very rare.
Memtest86 and burncpu do not produce errors, and windows works fine on same box. Both 2.4.x and 2.6.7 kernels.
3) Main. I have got a reiserfs partition with some errors (due to 2)), and kernel panics on it when i do 'find /'.
with these errors:

Both 2.4.x and 2.6.7. Running fsck.reiserfs --rebuild-trees cured problem,
but should it behave like this anyway?
I have this kernel and this filesystem image, and will assist if someone will go fix this.
All numbers here was transferred by screen-paper-screen, so are not guaranted to be correct.
4) I have sacred cow files on my XFS system (again thanx to 2)).
They exist, but can not be stat()ed and deleted.
like this:
==
(1)/usr/share/locale/gr% LANG=C ls
ls: ESSAGES: No such file or directory
ls: : No such file or directory

fsck.xfs looks pretty like void main() {};, what should i do?
P.S. Athlon 1333, Via KT266 (Elitegroup motherboard), Seagate Barracuda (don't actually remember model, ST2x0036A?).
Kernel 2.6.7.
Checked with memtest86 (3 passes), cpuburn (25 mins), SeaTools (controller, simple, and full tests) - all OK.
P.P.S. Please CC responces to me.
