I'm suspending and resuming all the time using HT. FWIW, I think it's
more likely that you're not seeing the issue for two reasons.
1) User space has been frozen when the suspend/resume methods are called
(I'm right in assuming that only swsusp/pmdisk, suspend-to-ram and
suspend2 would be doing suspends, aren't I?).
2) People tend to wait until the machine has powered down before
unplugging things, and plug things in before powering on.
Please excuse me if I'm speaking nonsense :>
Regards,
Nigel
