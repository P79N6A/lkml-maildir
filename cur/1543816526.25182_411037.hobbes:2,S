So, if fs creator is Linux then HURD doesn't try to use those fields?
That would allow Linux to start using them, and if such a filesystem
is used on HURD then it could store the translator/author/mode_high
in the xattr space.  Does it even make sense to add translator/author
to existing files, or only at file creation time?
That would mean that Linux would just need to check the fs creator
field before using any of the HURD-reserved fields.

Not that we will be in a rush to use these fields, but it would be good
to know what i_mode_high is used for in case it ever becomes relevant
for Linux we would want to keep it the same meaning as HURD.

I'm not sure what is required for supporting such EAs?  I don't think
any kernel would remove existing EAs, even if it doesn't understand
them.
Cheers, Andreas
