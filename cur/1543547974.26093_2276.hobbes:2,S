So what? I have been running Linux from long before the craze started, and
I suspect I'll be doing so long after it dies down (if it does).
In any case, in Linux (and OS software in general) I find it is much easier
to get bugs fixed than with closed alternatives. The hard problem is to
find bugs to fix... there are so few ;-)

The people at the helm of those companies seem to think otherwise. And I
suspect they know a bit more about their respective states of affairs than
you do. 
In a way they have forked the kernel (mildly) already, just look at the
patches they apply to the kernels they ship. But none of them can match the
manpower of the full kernel hacker community, so they know they have to
stay in synch with the official kernel in general terms.

Linux is doing fine, thank you.
