In which case the command
	PATH=$(obj):$$PATH $<
is likely do fail miserably too.
Also, the dependency list $(obj)/gentbl will be parsed as multiple
files when $(obj) contains spaces. Which is clearly the right
behavior, as it is hard to find a serious project that does not use
Makefile variables to hold the names of multiple dependencies
somewhere.

If one is afraid of that, one can use
	"$(obj)/gentbl"
which will prevent the shell from thinking that the space separates
"words" on the command line. (Whether one can trick make into
interpreting the space as part of the filename in the dependency list
is another matter).

I still disagree.

I don't think that "$<" is documented anywhere to have any exact
relationship to the string of characters used in the depencency
list. The GNU make manual says that $< is "the name of the first
depencency", not "the string used to identify the first dependency in
the rule".

Assuming anything for $< (and similar variables) but that they unfold
to SOME name that references the file in question, is open to
misinterpretation and leads to unportable makefiles.
