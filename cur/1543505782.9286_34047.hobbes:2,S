There is no point handling the cases you cant get out of. If you look at
the kernel you will see a lot of cases where we dont check stuff because
a) it cant actually fail in the real world during init time b) if it did
we couldnt recover anyway so its better to oops
Quite a few pieces of code are in that category - by no means all it shows up.
Also btw scripts/* isnt part of the kernel and fs/proc/omirr isnt compiled
into anything.
Most of those are real errors in the "incorrect but cant happen" category not
just init however.
Thanks
Alan
