think apps keeping crypto keys etc in ram and wiping them from signal
handlers. eg gnupg does this; fortunately it seems to have moved from
memset() to a open coded solution, so probably isn't affected. OTOH
it wouldn't surprise me these days if the compiler would emit string
ops even w/o an explicit mem* call.
Copying a private memory region to some public buffer could also lead
to interesting results... 
IOW being able to avoid a memset (or copying the wrong data) certainly
could have security consequences.
