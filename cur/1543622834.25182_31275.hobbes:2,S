I've heard about that IRQ imbalance on MP P4 Xeons from a person at Dell.
My understanding of it is that it's a consequence of the local APIC
priorization changes Intel did in the P4 xAPIC design. (Study Intel's IA32
Vol 3 manual in detail and you'll see them.) Supposedly Ingo Molnar is
working on a solution.
