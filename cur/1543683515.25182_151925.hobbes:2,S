Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/27/144

The patch below changes the following in Configure.help:
- remove entry for the CONFIG_MTD_BOOTLDR_PARTS option that is no longer
  present
- document the following options (all help texts stolen from 2.6):
  - CONFIG_MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS
  - CONFIG_MTD_CFI_B8
  - CONFIG_MTD_CFI_I8
  - CONFIG_MTD_CFI_STAA
Please apply

-Compaq bootldr partition table parsing
-CONFIG_MTD_BOOTLDR_PARTS
-  The Compaq bootldr deals with multiple 'images' in flash devices
-  by putting a table in one of the first erase blocks of the device,
-  similar to a partition table, which gives the offsets, lengths and
-  names of all the images stored in the flash.
-
-  If you need code which can detect and parse this table, and register
-  MTD 'partitions' corresponding to each image in the table, enable
-  this option.
+CONFIG_MTD_CMDLINE_PARTS
+  Allow generic configuration of the MTD paritition tables via the kernel
+  command line. Multiple flash resources are supported for hardware where
+  different kinds of flash memory are available. 
 
   You will still need the parsing functions to be called by the driver
   for your particular device. It won't happen automatically. The 
   SA1100 map driver (CONFIG_MTD_SA1100) has an option for this, for 
   example.
 
+  The format for the command line is as follows:
+
+  mtdparts=<mtddef>[;<mtddef]
+  <mtddef>  := <mtd-id>:<partdef>[,<partdef>]
+  <partdef> := <size>[@offset][<name>][ro]
+  <mtd-id>  := unique id used in mapping driver/device
+  <size>    := standard linux memsize OR "-" to denote all 
+  remaining space
+  <name>    := (NAME)
+
+  Due to the way Linux handles the command line, no spaces are 
+  allowed in the partition definition, including mtd id's and partition 
+  names.
+
+  Examples:
+
+  1 flash resource (mtd-id "sa1100"), with 1 single writable partition:
+  mtdparts=sa1100:-
+
+  Same flash, but 2 named partitions, the first one being read-only:
+  mtdparts=sa1100:256k(ARMboot)ro,-(root)
+
+  If unsure, say 'N'.
