Subject: 2.6.0-test7: ide / reiserfs errors? (reiserfs_read_locked_inode)

This is my first real post to the list. If I can better provide
information, please let me know, so I can give the best possible data.
Thanks for any hand-holding, and keep up the great work.
I am seeing ide/reiserfs errors in 2.6.0-test7. I did not stick around
long enough to investigate futher than what you see below:
System
Asus A7M266-D motherboard
Two AMD XP+ 1800 CPUs
512MB DDR RAM
Disk drive: hda: ST3120023A, ATA DISK drive
Paramaters passed to kernel via grub: root=/dev/hda6 idebus=66
ide0=ata66 ide1=ata66
I may be confused as to how the bus speed is set in 2.6, but I did not
have these problems in 2.6.0-test6 or earlier.

This goes on for quite a while.
