Hmm. Perhaps. But if we went there we would need to add something like.
/* But finding a less obese platform to run these less obese libraries is a
   challenge.  Unix clones like UZI have been shown to run a complete system
   including user space binaries in just 64KB of RAM, on systems
   originally designed to run CPM.  But today you can't find a general
   purpose kernel whose binary much less it footprint fits in 256KB.
   It seems bloatware is everywhere.

I have days when I'm frustrated by the size of both glibc and the
linux kernel.  stripped both the linux kernel and glibc are comparable
in size.  Though I think the 400KB of compressed glibc-2.1.2 is
actually smaller than the kernel for the most part.  I have to strip
off practically everthing to get a useable bzImage under 400KB.
So any good ideas on how to get the size of linux down?
