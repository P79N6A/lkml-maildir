Hi David,
Sorry about the mindless waffle earlier on - I'd just come in from work
and was suffering from brain death ;) I must remember to wait an hour or
so before touching a computer after I come in from work.
Ok, I've been fiddling around with the driver tonight and have managed
to get a little further by forcing the driver to do a full reset of the
chip when the RX buffer over flows. I achieved this by sticking a return
1; at the top of gem_rxmac_reset().
I'm guessing this isn't an "optimal" reset for the situation but so far
it's having /reasonable/ results (i.e. I don't have to bring the
interface up and down every 30 seconds!).
Here's the output of the ping;
monkey:/home/andy# ping -f -s 1472 shroom

Hope this helps,
