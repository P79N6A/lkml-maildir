I'll defer to Mark on this one.  However, please remember that you can't
just blindly remove GFP_DMA ... there are some cards which require it.
Aacraid is one example ... it has a set of cards that can only DMA to 31
bits.  For them, the GFP_DMA is necessary:  The allocation in question
is a scatterlist, which must be within the device DMA mask.
