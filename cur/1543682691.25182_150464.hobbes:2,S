Not necessarily.  It's quite possible (likely even) that one architecture might
have N bytes overhead per call,  and is allowed a 4K stack, and some other
architecture has (N+30%) overhead, so 4K isn't enough - 5K is needed. However,
other considerations cause a whole-page allocation, so instead of allocating
5K, it goes to 8K, with a 3K wastage....
So yes, you can end up with suboptimal results.
