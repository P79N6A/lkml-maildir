Nevermind the fact that you can arm yourself with an electronics 
book, walk into radio shack, and with a couple hours of work have a 
pretty powerful jammer on the order of a few watts.   Compared to the 
30mW of a typical wireless card (and no amount of soft-radioing will 
change that..)
If you're out to cause malice, you don't need to hotwire your spiffy new 
centrino.
