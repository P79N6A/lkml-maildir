Nope; the relevant code was always with "__u64".  The issue was
warning when turning that into a __user pointer.

ISTR the warning was the other way around:   about "cast from integer
to pointer of a different size".  The __u64 came from userspace and
the kernel pointer was only 32 bits.  Not really truncation, but GCC
could not know that directly ... ergo the extra non-pointer cast.
