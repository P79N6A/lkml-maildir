Dear Linux kernel people,
   just to tell you that the PS/2 mouse port of a DELL Dimension D300
on which I regularly run Linux won't be recognized by any of the 2.1.x
and 2.2.0preX kernel I've tried (from long ago to 2.2.0pre4).
It looks like the device is not recognized/initialized properly.
Is it a known bug? Is it related to the PS/2 mouse not being modular anymore?
The computer uses a M$ stupidimouse, but I doubt this is related
(apart from the fact that DELL hardware quality may be questionned).
   Since Linus wants bug-reports to happen *before* 2.2.0, I felt it was
my duty to contribute.
PS: I'm not on the list anymore, but I'm willing to help as a user/tester
of (possibly old) linux kernels.
Best regards,
