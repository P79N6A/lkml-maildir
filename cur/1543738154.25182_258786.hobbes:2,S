Are you sure you can find and pay sufficient money to the thousands 
upon thousands
of people who contributed code to the linux kernel?  In some cases you 
may not be
able to contact copyright owners of critical code, in which case you 
can't distribute
those pieces at all.  The whole point of "Open-Source" is that the 
users are free to fix
the bug in the program you sent them, and that they're free to change 
it however they
want.
In any case, Alan Cox's "offer" was for $100,000 per copy, not $50,000 
for an eternal
license.  :-D
Cheers,
