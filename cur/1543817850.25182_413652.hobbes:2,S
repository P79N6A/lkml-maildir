 I'm not sure if this is helping or not - a few hours ago, I took a 
couple of new things out of my .config (vga scrollback, new rtc) and the 
oops only happened when I opened a second tab in firefox (that is, start 
the sound app, then start firefox, then open another tab).  With this 
patch, it oopsed when I opened a _third_ tab.
 I guess something else is involved.
