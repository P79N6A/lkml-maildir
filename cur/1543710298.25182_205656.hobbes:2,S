> Martin, have you tried adding this printk?
Sorry for the delay. I had to get 2.6.4-mm1 working before doing the
"ouch" test. The new pte_to_pgprot/pgoff_prot_to_pte stuff wasn't easy.
I tested 2.6.4-mm1 with the blk_run_queues move and the ouch printk.
The first interesting observation is that 2.6.4-mm1 behaves MUCH better
then 2.6.4:
2.6.4-mm1 with 1 cpu
# time ./mempig 600
Count (1Meg blocks) = 600
600  of 600
Done.
real    0m2.587s
user    0m0.100s
sys     0m0.730s
#
2.6.4-mm1 with 2 cpus
# time ./mempig 600
Count (1Meg blocks) = 600
600  of 600
Done.
real    0m10.313s
user    0m0.160s
sys     0m0.780s
#
2.6.4 takes > 1min for the test with 2 cpus.
The second observation is that I get only a few "ouch" messages. They
all come from the blk_congestion_wait in try_to_free_pages, as expected.
What I did not expect is that I only got 9 "ouches" for the run with
2 cpus.
blue skies,
