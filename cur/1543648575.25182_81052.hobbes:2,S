Hi All,
  I'm involved in migrating an OS/2 system to Linux, which involves applications as well as drivers.
  I have some doubts/questions on implementing asynchronous,
repeated-interval timer mechanism with semaphore support.
	I meant porting Event Semaphores available in OS/2 to Linux.
(DosCreateEventSem,DosWaitEventSem,DosResetEventSem,DosPostEventSem)
  My need is to have semaphores which will be signalled (posted)
repeated-interval timer mechanis asynchronously.
  In other words,
                I need to implement asynchronous, repeated-interval
timer mechanism with semaphore support.
  We thought of using condition variable (pthread_cond_init, etc..)
and mutex combination to achieve this.
  But it seems pthread's mutex and condition variable synchronization
calls are off limits.  pthread mutex-locking routines are not
asynchronous signal safe.
	It would be helpful, if I could get to know on how to achieve this
event semaphore mechanism in Linux.
	Have a nice time.
Warm Regards
Arun
