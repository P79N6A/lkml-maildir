Subject: Radeon Framebuffer Driver in 2.6.3?

Dear all,
Before, please cc me the answer, as I'm not on the list right now.
In 2.6.3 (including -mmX patches), radeon framebuffer seems to having
problems. Everytime I do clear screen, it only 'half cleared'. I still
can see the mark of the previous texts in shaded mode. And it does not
do deletion well, too. 
Anybody else having the same problem?
I like to see what's the problem, but I don't know framebuffer code (or
any kernel code at all) well. If someone could give me pointer, I could
give it a shot. 
My hardware is, IBM Thinkpad T30 with Radeon 7500 card.
2.6.2 and 2.4 does not have this problem. 
Regards.
