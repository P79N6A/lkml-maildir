No, we need a smarter free list structure. There have been several attempts
at this in the past. Two that I can recall off the top of my head:
	- per node unused LRUs
	- per superblock unusued LRUs
I guess we need to revisit this again, because limiting the size of
the cache like this is not an option.

Try something that relies on leaving the working set on the unused
list, like NFS server benchmarks that have a working set of tens of
million of files....

nr_in_use is going to overflow 32 bits with this calculation.
