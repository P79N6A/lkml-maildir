Hi,
 
As far as I'm concerned, it's a loopback bug.
Somebody appears to be trying to copy a 'struct file' in the routine
'loop_set_fd'. This will cause havoc in any and all filesystems that
rely on f_ops->open() , f_ops->release() to maintain internal data.
In this case, it's the file's RPC authorizations, that are getting
garbage-collected from beneath you once the original struct file gets
fput() at the end of the routine.
Cheers,
  Trond
