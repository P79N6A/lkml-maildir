Hah, that's a lot more plausible than bcm43xx's drain patch actually
causing this. So maybe somehow interrupts for bcm43xx aren't routed
properly or something...
Ray, please check /proc/interrupts when this happens.
I am convinced that the patch in question (drain tx status) is not
causing this -- the patch should be a no-op in most cases anyway, and in
those cases where it isn't a no-op it'll run only once at card init and
remove some things from a hardware-internal FIFO.
