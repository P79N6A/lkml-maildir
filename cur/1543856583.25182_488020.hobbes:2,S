the question is: which is more important, the type safety of a 
container_of() [or type cast], which if we get it wrong produces a 
/very/ trivial crash that is trivial to fix - or embedded timers data 
structure size all around the kernel? I believe the latter is more 
important.
and we could have a runtime debugging option to tie the type of the 
structure to the timer list entry. For example by using 
__builtin_classify_type(), sizeof() and offsetof() to fingerprint timer 
structs at init_timer time, and then checking for that at container_of() 
time - or something like that. In fact, gcc should really give us a 
better way to categorize types than __builtin_classify_type(). We could 
probably improve the situation by having some global registry of types 
known to the kernel, via a huge switch() around 
__builtin_types_compatible_p().
