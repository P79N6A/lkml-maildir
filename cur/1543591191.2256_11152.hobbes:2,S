Most of these solutions (and RAID IDs and UUIDs) don't completely 
solve the problem; they just push it to a different time: how do you 
talk about a new disk, or a new RAID array, or a moved disk? And what 
about removable media (not neglecting the possibility of multiple 
drives)? Removable media from another OS? Shared drives?
Not that this kind of "firm" ID might not be an improvement, or at 
least a good sanity check.
[Side question, not original with me: why isn't all this a 2.5 discussion?]
