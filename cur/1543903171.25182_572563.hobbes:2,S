Hmm, I see I don't understand what this driver is doing.  What is a
"struct ioatdma_device"?  Is this driver requesting interrupts that
come from the NIC or the IOAT DMA engine?
Anyway, if the NICs support MSI-X, is there any chance of failing to
get one MSI-X vectors but then succeeding in getting MSI enabled?
How could that happen?  I don't see what falling back to MSI buys you
beyond more code.
