Problem Description:
There appears to be a memory leak in the VFS code.  Nikita Danilov
<Nikita@Namesys.COM> posted to the LKML, and I am able to reproduce the
situation. Running fsstress (file system stress tools from XFS ported by Andi
Kleen <ak@suse.de>) on an ext3 filesystem as 
./fsstress -d . -f sync=0 -n 1000000000 -p 111 -v
The kernel begins to use lots of memory in ext3_inode_cache and dentry_cache.
Nikita was able to do this on ext2, and reiser, and I can reproduce it on ext3.
The memory will not release under VM pressure, but does appear to release some
of it if you erase the files created by the fsstress tool. With basically
nothing running, /proc/meminfo is reporting over 50megs Active. The kernel will
not release this memory, despite userspace trying to alloc memory (the alloc'ing
process will instead be killed).  The filesystem is mounted with the default
options (ordered data mode)
There was a change to fs/dcache.c in 2.6.0-test6 that may be responsible.
Steps to reproduce:
run ./fsstress -d . -f sync=0 -n 1000000000 -p 111 -v for a while (an hour or so).
