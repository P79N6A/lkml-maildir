That's one option which I don't think I've seen implemented.
The other possibility which comes to mind, and which I _have_ seen
implemented, is not to hide the disabled option but to _show_ it, and
represent its dependencies right there next to it somehow. 
Where I saw this done was actually in the Nemesis kernel configuration,
which was based on our old tcl xconfig tool. It actually worked quite
well. It's a _long_ time ago now, but IIRC it was in a cell below the
disabled option. It'd look something like (remember hte old xconfig?):
------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  USB Mass storage support                      |  o Y   o M   ✓ N    |
------------------------------------------------------------------------
|  depends on:  o SCSI   ✓ USB                                         |
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sure I had a screenshot of it once. But it doesn't matter; you get
the idea -- our current tools would do it differently anyway. But they
_could_ do it.

Well one option, as you suggest, is just that if you go into the
graphical tool and enable USB_STORAGE, you get SCSI turned on
automatically. That's simple enough and the xconfig tool can do it quite
easily. It just needs to _show_ you the option, which isn't particularly
hard. But what I care about is that when you when you explicitly set
 # CONFIG_SCSI is not set
and run 'make oldconfig' it doesn't get turned back on again.
But as I said, I'm not entirely averse to having to do 'make
oldconfig-noselect' or something like that to preserve the old
behaviour. And then you can sprinkle 'select' wherever you like without
bothering those of us who object.
