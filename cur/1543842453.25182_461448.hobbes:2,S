I don't see how that is.  I understand that you could be unconvinced
by my reasoning and by my arguments, but I don't see how they are
contradictory.
The bottom line is that, whereas for root making syscalls fail (or,
worse, in the case of setuid(), behave subtly diffently) is a radical
change, for non-root it is something which should always be expected
(fork() can fail for lack of resources, write() can fail for quota
exhaution, etc.), and not something an attacker should be able to
exploit.

I wish I could offer more assurance, but unfortunately the solutions
which do away with the risk come with a great cost:

This makes it trivial to regain capabilities: just create a program
suid yourself and exec it.  OK, we can say that "yourself" won't work,
but you still only need to find another uid to hijack...  Not too
satisfactory.  Perhaps if we create a capability to add the 's' bit to
anything?  That's a bit messy, but perhaps feasible.

This is probably too stringent: remove any trivial capability
whatsoever and you lose a rather important ability.
But certainly this is a matter for some debate...
