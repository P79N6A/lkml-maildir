I found what was causing the problem.
I had two scsi cards set to the same scsi host id. Double plus ungood as they
say in the Microsoft world.
Another problem I have seen before with scsi.  Not certain if there is a clean
work around other than "don't do that".  If you have a scsi card compiled into
the kernel and as a module (left over from a previous build), the kernel tends
to see the card twice and then choke and die.  It would be nice (though I am
not holding my breath) to have the module check to see if that functionality
exists in the kernel already and refuse to load. (With apreopreate error
message of course.)
