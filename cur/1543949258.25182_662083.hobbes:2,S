Subject: e1000 driver not loading in 2.6.24.3 on x86_64 (worked in 2.6.24-rc7)

I'm trying to move from 2.6.24-rc7 to 2.6.24.3 on a x86_64 desktop
machine. With 2.6.24.3, the e1000 driver (compiled in, not a module)
does not claim the device. In 2.6.24-rc7 it works just fine.
The ethernet device shows up in lspci in both kernels, but the driver
doesn't seem to probe the card in 2.6.24.3

There were a few minor configuration changes between the two kernels
(added ACPI_SYSFS_POWER, removed ACPI_PROC_EVENT) but nothing I would
think that prevent the e1000 driver from loading.
                                          Any ideas?
