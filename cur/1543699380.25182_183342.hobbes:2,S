You probably should have mentioned that this statement was made not
by a judge or a lawyer, but by a CS professor in an amicus curiae
brief.  And the implication that this argument had much to do with
the outcome of the Microsoft case--which was about antitrust and
bundling, not copyrights--is disingenuous.

You are extrapolating way too far.  There are so many differences
between the Linux-module issue and the vague doomsday scenario you
are trying to conjure.  Linus explained one (coherence and stability
of the API/ABI), and I think it could be easily be cast as a test
that a court could apply.
Maybe you can describe a specific case in which Linus's argument
backfires?  I'm not saying you have no point at all, just that I
don't think this one thing is holding back the flood-waters.
