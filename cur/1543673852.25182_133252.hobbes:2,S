it'll be altered to work with the firewall. Or rather the other way.

Yes, that is the one and only failure of the system.
I can suggest that the author be able to give the work(s)
an extension if the network is unreachable, at renewal time.
theres always the posibility of using closed source modules
instead which could allow network problems temporary reprisal
but I don't like it.
Now I know I was branded a troll earlier for saying that
Larry used mild DRM, but I thought it monitored and gave samples
of code to make sure closed source things wern't made with the 
free version, and it monitored push, pull activity, Which is why
I wonder if Larry has any Ideas, but I never made to insinuate he
was "evil". Especially as I like the BK/CVS gatway.

DEANO.
Arg, theres always someone who wants to bathe in his own
self importance, and brand other people trolls (LETS NOT START A 
CONVERSATION OVER THAT THOUGH).
