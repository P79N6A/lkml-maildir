Xenix 3.0 and later provided semaphores and "shared data", bound to the
filesystem via "name files" (S_IFNAM).  The st_rdev field of (struct
stat) revealed the exact type of name file:  S_INSHD for a shared data
namefile, S_INSEM for a semaphore namefile.  Their behavior was rather
like bound AF_UNIX sockets in that you couldn't treat them as files: 
no open() etc., but a separate set of calls for each namefile.
SCO systems still support those for Xenix compatibility, since they can
run Xenix/286 and Xenix/386 programs, so we might have to be careful
about adopting 050000 for something else.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
