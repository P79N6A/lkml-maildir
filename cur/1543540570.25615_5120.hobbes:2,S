There is some control (read balance_dirty() in fs/buffer.c),
but it's not done completely right...
We do write throttling by not allowing more than 40% of the
buffer memory to be dirty, counting cache memory as freeable
memory usable for dirty buffers. This is where we go wrong.
Since we can also use cache memory for other things (most
notably, caching executable code), we'll end up with the
situation that write throttling kicks in so late that we'll
put a high pressure on other, useful, parts of the cache
and indirectly on the RSS of processes and executable code.
The attached patch should alleviate the situation quite a
lot. It guesstimates that 1/3rd of the cache is "freeable"
and old data and takes only that amount into account. The
30% should be about right in heavy write situations because
if we never fill that much cache memory with our writes there
would be no need to do write throttling.
regards,
Rik
