In this case, I have a public .h (asm-xxx/msi.h) which needs a data structure
decleared down in a driver-private file (drivers/pci/msi-apic.c).  Do you have
a suggestion for where I should put the msi_apic_ops declaration?  It should
be somewhere such that future msi ops (e.g. sn_msi_ops from patch3) would
be treated consistently.
linux/pci.h seems like one possiblity near where the ops struct is declared,
but that doesn't really seem right, because we'ld want to treat sn_msi_ops
(and future msi ops) the same way.
Maybe just move the extern out of the function and up further in the
asm-xxx/msi.h file?

ok.  Will submit a new version once we have the placement of the msi_apic_ops
declaration sorted out.
