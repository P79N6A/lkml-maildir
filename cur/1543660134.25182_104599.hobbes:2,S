Hi, Greg!
After reading the pci_hotplug_core.c, I found there are many codes 
that are used to implement the pcihpfs. And how about using sysfs instead
of pcihpfs ? I think it could make the pci_hotplug_core.c smaller. Another
pro is that we will nerver be bothered by the pcihpfs' bug.
How you think about it?
Regards,
Stanley Wang
