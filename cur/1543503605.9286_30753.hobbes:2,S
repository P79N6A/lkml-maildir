Agreed. It was also abused quite a lot by virus/trojan writers.
I think it would only be a matter of time before we saw such things
on Linux if this was implemented. (Although if you could convince
a root user to run a kernel modifying program, then you could probably
get the same person to insert any arbitrary module/apply source patch.)
Adding a feature like this can only be a bad thing,as we'd get things
features/fixes running as patches that get missed/not added to the
official tree etc, thus forking the kernel.
