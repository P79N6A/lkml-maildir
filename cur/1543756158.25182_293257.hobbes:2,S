the vanilla 2.6.10 x64 kernel, using 32-bit fedora userland boots fine
here, and gives a noexec stack:
 $ ./test-stack
 Segmentation fault
 $
 $ uname -a
 Linux saturn 2.6.10 #1 Sun Feb 6 15:52:44 CET 2005 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 $
 $ readelf -l test-stack | grep STA
   GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x00000000 0x00000000 0x00000 0x00000 RW  0x4
