I made the dlh (disk latency hack) and it is related to a problem of system
response under heavy IO load, NOT the actual IO throughput so this sounds
unrelated. However, I have seen what you describe with reiserFS and ide raid at
least and had it fixed by applying AA's stuck in D fix, which ReiserFS is more
prone to for some complicated reason. Give that a go.
In 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.20aa1/
it is patch 9980_fix-pausing-2
