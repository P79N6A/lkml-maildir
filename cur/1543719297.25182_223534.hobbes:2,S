Which kernel? I think it should be removed since 2.5.73
ChangeSet@1.1046.234.10, 2003-06-06 09:01:05-04:00, hch@lst.de
  [PATCH] kill scsihosts= boot parameter
  This feature is seriously racy, and doesn't work under many
  circumstances.  As we have proper ways to find devices by their
  their locical naming (UUID, fs label) or physical connectivity
  (scsidev, sysfs) it shouldn't be nessecary anymore.
