So it does and POSIX.1 (_SC_CLK_TCK) compliant as well.  Unfortunately, 
the presence of this functionality makes it VERY difficult to understand 
why ticks are being converted from HZ==1000 values to HZ=100 values when 
they are being exported to user space especially as this conversion 
throws away precision.  Can anyone enlighten me?
