I made that mistake too at first, Mingming set me straight.
Many of the entry points down() the ipc_ids.sem semaphore, but the
most significant ones do not.  ipc/sem.c is probably the best example
(if confusing, since it involves quite different meanings of semaphore):
sys_semop() is the frequent, fast entry point, uses sem_lock without down.
