Subject: [PATCH 2/2] ACPICA: 80 column adherence (no functional change)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/30/310

This patch modifies a file derived from ACPI CA and as such formatting
may come directly from the CA code or indirectly from some type of parsing
of the original CA code.  As such, non-functional formatting changes may be
counter productive.  If this is the case then feel free to ignore this
component of the patch series.
This modification may be used under either the GPL or the BSD-style
license used for Intel ACPI CA code.
