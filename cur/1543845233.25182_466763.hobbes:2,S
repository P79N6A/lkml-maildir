I gather that one reason for working so hard with the inline assembly
is a race condition problem with the plain STAP_MARK style of marker
disconnection:
        if (pointer) (*pointer)(args ...);
Granted, but this problem could almost certainly be dealt with simpler
than that.  How about a compxchg or other atomic-fetch of the static
pointer with a local variable?  That should solve the worry of an
(*NULL) call.
If we then become concerned with a valid pointer become obsolete (the
probe handler function wanting to unload), we might be able to use
some RCU-type deferral mechanism and/or preempt controls to ensure
that this does not happen.
