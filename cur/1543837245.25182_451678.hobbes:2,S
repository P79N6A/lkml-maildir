For those who use a graphical client this should not be a problem, pixels 
are plenty. For 80x25 readers, well, I can only suggest to use an index 
listing optimized to your needs. For example, the default pine listing 
left too few space for the subject for me on LKML, so I changed it to be 
like
(index-format=MSGNO STATUS SUBJECT FROM SMARTTIME SIZENARROW)

Since a lot of mails are already prefixed with something [], like [PATCH], 
I do not really mind if there's [nonsub], or if you like to keep it short, 
you can make that [NSUB], and it even outperforms [PATCH] wrt. length.
Then it would only take the key sequence ;ts[NSUB]<Enter>adx to kill all 
the nonsub messages. However, I would also be fine with an extra header in 
the mail header saying "this comes from a non-subscriber", the key seq in 
pine would be slightly bigger though, 
";thMajordomo-Info<Enter>nonsub<Enter>adx".
