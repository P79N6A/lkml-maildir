Your opinion is noted, however it's also noted that you didn't support it in
any way.
Also, it appears you didn't read the post you responded to.  Two alternatives
were presented:
  1) Load the whole mp3 into memory before playing it
  2) Implement a filesystem with realtime response
Both approaches have their uses.  The second is the one I'm interested in,
if that isn't already obvious.  The first is just a quick hack that will
give you guaranteed-skipless audio playback, something that Linux is
currently unable to do.

No no no.  The compiler/debugger run under the general purpose OS, and only
a stub of the debugger runs on the RTOS.
