Yes, the only hint to the filesystem that it's time to do a full commit
is when we get the sync_supers() call, so that really has to be done
after we've let the inode cache flush dirty inodes to the filesystem.

No, you'd really want to do the DQUOT_SYNC before the sync_supers() for
the same reason that we do the inodes before, but definitely we want to
do the sync_buffers() last.
Cheers,
 Stephen
