There are still a few i's and t's left to dot and cross:
* the changeset comments needs a Signed-off-by: line
* The MAINTAINERS file should list your name and logfs mailing list
* you have a few instances of '#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > 
  KERNEL_VERSION(2, 6, 23)', that should go away for the merge
* The copyright notice says 2005-2007, it should probably be 2005-2008
* You may want to add a Documentation/filesystems/logfs.txt file explaining
  the supported mount options.
* CONFIG_LOGFS should be tristate, not bool. Unfortunately, you are still
  using three symbols that are not exported: swapper_space (through
  BUG_ON(!page_mapping(page)->a_ops->set_page_dirty)), add_to_page_cache_lru
 and inode_lock. Not sure what to do about this.
* You should really make sure the version you check in compiles, 
  fs/logfs/logfs.h is missing an #endif. ;-)
Otherwise, I don't see any reasons why logfs shouldn't go in. The code is
clean, feature-complete, and there is demand for it. The main question
I can still see is the timing with the merge window. It's almost closed,
so if logfs doesn't go in really soon, it should probably wait for the
2.6.27 window.
