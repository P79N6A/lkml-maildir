Hi,
i don't know if this is kernel related ?
server is exporting nfs 2.3TB
/dev/md0              2.3T  959G  1.4T  41% /raid
on the client i see this as 316GB :
storage:/raid         316GB  129GB  187GB  41% /raid
server is running 2.6.10-rc2
client is running 2.6.9-ac11
both have LBD support enabled
(and both are running tao (which is based on rhel 3))
any ideas ?
