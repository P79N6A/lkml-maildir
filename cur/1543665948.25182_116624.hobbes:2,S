Ok. So the test really is for one particular version only.
That's easy. I'll just add a
	#ifdef CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER
	#if __GNUC__ == 2 && __GNUC_MINOR__ == 96
	#error This compiler is not safe with frame pointers
	#endif
	#endif
to <linux/compiler.h>. Yeah, it will get some fixed compilers too, but 
that's just not worth worrying about - people will just have to turn off 
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER and be happy.
