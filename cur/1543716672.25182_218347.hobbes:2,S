As a quick answer, below is a copy of an email from Christoph Hellwig
from 18 months ago where says how glad he is to see it and wants to
know if it will stay.  Basically, without hashing the dentry, it will
get allocated and deallocated very frequently which has negative
consequences.  It would actually be nice to hold a "file" around
instead of just a "dentry", but a dentry is better than nothing.

Yes.  That behaviour is intentional and will stay.
