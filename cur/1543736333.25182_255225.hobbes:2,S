The principle of avoiding kernel bloat means that if it doesn't have
to be done in the kernel, it should be done in userspace.  If all
you're providing is an CRNG, the question then is why should it be
done in kernel, when it could be done just as easily in userspace, and
using /dev/random as its input?

No, what I'm saying is that crypto primitives can get weakened; this
is a fact of life.  SHA-0, MD4, MD5, etc. are now useless as general
purpose cryptographic hashes.  Fortuna makes the assumptions that
crypto primitives will never break, as it relies on them so heavily.
I have a problem with this, since I remember ten years ago when people
were as confident in MD5 as you appear to be in SHA-256 today.
Crypto academics are fond of talking about how you can "prove" that
Fortuna is secure.  But that proof handwaves around the fact that we
have no capability of proving whether SHA-1, or SHA-256, is truly
secure.
In contrast, /dev/random doesn't have this dependence, which (a) is a
good thing, and (b) why it doesn't bother with the SHA finalization
step.  It's simply not necessary.
