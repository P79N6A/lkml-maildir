He's not making it a god. He's saying that if you wish to discuss its  
design, you first have to learn what that design *is*.
Though personally, I think the problem is less that Tim has problems  
understanding C, but that he couldn't construct a reasonable argument if  
his life depended on it. In this discussion, he's consistently come up  
with code snippets that illustrated different problems than the text he  
wrote to go with them, and then gone all upset when his meaning wasn't  
crystal clear to everyone and everyone didn't applaud him.
