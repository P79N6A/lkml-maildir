Subject: [PATCH] don't swapon mounted devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The attached patch against 2.4.21-pre3 fixes a problem in sys_swapon.
Previous behavior:
	* boot kernel with "root=/dev/sda3 init=/bin/bash" (ext3 root)
	* mount -t proc proc /proc
	* /sbin/swapon /dev/sda3    <--- NOTE: same as root!
	* mount -n -o remount,rw /
	* oops in __make_request because superblock buffer_head is
	  no longer mapped (via sys_swapon -> set_blocksize ->
	  kill_bdev-> truncate_inode_pages -> do_flushpage ->
	  block_flushpage -> discard_bh_page -> discard_buffer)
I think 2.5 avoids this problem by attempting to get exclusive
use of the device with bd_claim (see
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.369.32.10?nav=index.html
|src/.|src/mm|related/mm/swapfile.c)
bd_claim is not in 2.4, so this seems next-best.
