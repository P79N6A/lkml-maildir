To flesh this out.
Both using PC card adapter and USB the SmartMedia cards i've
used do have partition tables with only partition 1 being
defined. The filesystem type and ID has been either a FAT12
or FAT16 depending on size.
I have not tried changing the table or filesystem type since
i use them almost exclusively for the digicams.
