my one line patch just skips an io registration with a simple sanity check.
never once have i heard a device with an ioport of 0x0.
question is why it happens and only once.
tested with
ISA Plug and Play:
U.S. Robotics Sportster 33600 FAX/Voice Int
Creative ViBRA16C PnP
Crystal Codec
Host/PCI Bridge:
VIA Technologies, In VT82C585VP [Apollo V
VIA Technologies, In VT82C586/A/B PCI-to-
VIA Technologies, In VT82C586/B/686A/B PI
VIA Technologies, In USB
VIA Technologies, In VT82C586B ACPI
(also noticing cutoff in /sys/devices/pci0/*/name)
