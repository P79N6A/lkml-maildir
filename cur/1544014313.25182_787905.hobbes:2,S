But define incorrect.  If container B does an nfs mount, container c
is launched with a tree in that mount, container B dies, and container C
umounts it.  Should the umount belong to container B (for having
mounted it), container C (for having umount it), or the init_utsname
(for being the physical host/kernel)?
I get the feeling that consensus on this thread is that init_utsname
is actually the best choice, but OTOH if I have 3 containers on my
host, for apache, mysql, and postfix servers, and each is doing
nfs mounts from a physically remote machine, maybe I care about
having them report separate nodenames?
(that's a question, I really don't know...)
