You've made the foo-address to ascii string routines non-reentrant.
The hbuffer[] was on the local stack for a very good reason.
Why can't you write a userspace daemon that listens on one of the
lower level raw'ish sockets for arp packets and do the same checks
there.
I don't like this change at all, I think it can be done completely
in user space.  The existence of a working tcpdump is proof of this
fact. :-)  Whether it can be done efficiently is another issue.
Making it possible to do this efficiently would be the kernel change
which might result from your work on a userspace variant, so have at
it.
Even failing that, I would prefer something like a special "arp
netlink socket" which would allow a privileged userspace program
to hear all arp traffic the machine can hear.
