Subject: [PATCH][RFC] unbreak generic futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() on UP

[Resend. I messed up the To: line the first time]
As has been reported recently by Lennert Buytenhek, robust futexes
are broken on ARM:
>If you're also running into glibc's tst-robust1 test suite test
>locking up your ARM machine, you're probably running into the fact
>that asm-arm/futex.h includes asm-generic/futex.h, and
>asm-generic/futex.h defines futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() to
>return -ENOSYS.  This causes handle_futex_death() to loop forever.
I can confirm this statement: building glibc-2.4 with NPTL on
ARM hangs the kernel when the test suite reaches tst-robust1.
The problem is that kernel/futex.c expects futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic()
to return -EFAULT or the new value. It doesn't expect -ENOSYS at all, and
generally -ENOSYS causes the futex code to loop, hanging the kernel.
The higher-end archs (x86, sparc64, ppc64, etc) provide fully-functional
asm/futex.h implementations, but a number of archs (alpha, arm, arm26,
avr32, blackfin, cris, h8300, m32r, m68k, mk68knommu, sh64, sparc, um,
v850, and xtensa) use asm-generic/futex.h, which makes robust futexes
horribly broken on them. There have also been reports recently that PI
futexes are broken due to the generic futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic()
just being an -ENOSYS stub.
The patch below implements the generic futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() in
terms of __copy_{from,to}_user_inatomic() and preempt_{disable,enable}().
It obviously doesn't support SMP, but UP-only support should go a long
way for users of the affected archs.
I'm using this patch now and it has allowed me to build and use glibc-2.4
with NPTL on ARM (glibc-2.4-11.src.rpm from FC5 + ARM fixes).
(Finally I can ditch LinuxThreads :->)
Comments?
