	Uh, somehow I thought the reference was about  bh->b_blocknr;

	Register pressure burst at i386 ?

	Huh ?  No nice power-of-two and shifting ?
	(In filesystem side there is - AFFS or HFS - some which
	 have non-power-of-two block sizes, but luckily those
	 variants are also limited under 2G in file size...)
	Perhaps redoing  div64()  in inlined function instead of
	side-effectfull macro with explite variable passing via
	reference.
	Perhaps sacrificing a bit more, and using explicite
	div64() function which is exported in symbols (and
	explicite variable passing via reference)
	After all, if one really must use it, do it explicite,
	but first of all: reliable.
	It is  dividend64/divisor32 -> remainder64,modulo32  after all.
	(E.g. SLOW(er than 32/32 -> 32,32))
