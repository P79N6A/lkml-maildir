!!! No. internode aligned is 4k only if CONFIG_X86_VSMP is chosen.  The
internode line size defaults to SMP_CACHE_BYTES for all other machine types.
Please note that an INTERNODE_CACHE_SHIFT of 12 is defined under 
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_VSMP in include/asm-x86_64/cache.h

I was thinking on those lines as well.  But, until we get there, can we have
this in as stop gap?  The patch does not increase the memory footprint for
any other architecture other than vSMPowered systems.
