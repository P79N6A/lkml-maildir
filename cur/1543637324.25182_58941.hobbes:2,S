It is just that I was reading this page where they evaluate
gigi cards and they used the drivers from 3com.
http://www.cs.uni.edu/~gray/gig-over-copper/
The 3com drivers are open-source though, which makes
me less hesitent.  And the tigon3 drivers lack of documentation
kind of irks me.  I would however like to stick with a mainstream kernel
driver cause the support is there if it is needed.  I guess I will give
both versions a whirl.  From just glancing at the source of both, it seems
that both versions support jumbo frames which is really what I am after.
