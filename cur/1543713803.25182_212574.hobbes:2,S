This was very imprecise.  www.namesys.com/legalese.html describes it 
better.  If you give me the courtesy of allowing me to license reiserfs 
contributions to third parties (in addition to the usual GPL license), 
it is appreciated, and it allows me to sometimes earn badly needed funds 
for reiser4.
