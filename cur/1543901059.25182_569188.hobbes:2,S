Hi...
   Recently Keil has accepted few isdn related , pci_find_device
cleanup patches, which are currently in -mm tree and would probably be
in mainline kernel soon..
look the below url shows a mail from karsten keil..
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118029832418653&w=2
Just make sure patch only the files not listed in the above patch..
Also look at the kernel archives before you start patching , just to
make sure somebody has not done it already..
thanks
surya.

Hi;
Following patches replaces pci_find_device with pci_get_device (with some
whitespace cleanups) to avoid following warnings;
warning: `pci_find_device' is deprecated (declared at include/linux/pci.h:478)
occured while compiling the kernel for ages.
Although ISDN subsystem marked as Maintained, last activity on ISDN
subsystem's git tree occured 21 Month ago :( so for this reason i'm adding
LKML also.
