The NFSv4 client and server already do uid/gid mapping. That is
*mandatory* in the NFSv4 protocol, which dictates that you are only
allowed to send strings of the form user@domain on the wire.
If you really need uid/gid mapping for NFSv2/v3 too, why not just build
on the existing v4 upcall/downcall mechanisms?
