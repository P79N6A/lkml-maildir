I shifted the sata card into a 66MHz, 32bit PCI slot now and the
problems went away. Just for the record, this is an Asus PU-DLS
mainboard with E7501 chipset. Now I can dd from all devices without
any error messages, giving me about 360mb/s continuous throughput for
6 devices which isn't that bad I suppose.
The card gets assigned irq 22 in both configurations but in the
latter the irq is shared with the on-board usb-uhci controller
which somehow seems to work better...
Thanks for all your help,
Jan
