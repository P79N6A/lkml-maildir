You're looking at old source: it's gone in 2.6.15-rc.  There was a point
to it before 2.6.13 - arch/ppc64 used it on its ioremap_mm too, but has
since amalgamated that into init_mm.  I removed the arg in 2.6.15-rc,
not really as an optimization, more to force a build error on mismatch
when making a change to the locking there.
