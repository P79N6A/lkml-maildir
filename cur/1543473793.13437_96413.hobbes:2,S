This assumes a working /proc/cpuinfo, which until recently did not detect
my Cyrix anywhere near correctly.
In a similar vein: Alan, was rdtsc actually working in 2.2.0pre1acX, or was
the "patch up do_{fast,slow}timeoffset" code avoiding rdtsc?  And if it
*was* working, has anyone got any idea why it worked in 2.2.0pre1acX and
not 2.2.0pre1?
And lastly, given that, if I remember correctly, the Cyrix Cx5x86 was
essentially a fast 486, and the Cyrix Cx6x86 is (almost) a Pentium-class
processor, why is a Cyrix Cx6x86 reported as i686?  Shouldn't it say i586,
since it's (nearly) Pentium-class?
