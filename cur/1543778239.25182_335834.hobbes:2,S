Furthermore, rounding UP in order to "correct" this non-alignment would
definitely be a bug.
If users choose to override the default rsize/wsize, that is almost
always in order to limit the UDP fragmentation per read/write request on
lossy networks. By rounding up, you are doubling the number of fragments
that the user requested instead of respecting the limit.
