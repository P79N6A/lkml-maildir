  Hi there.  I've recently observed (as of 2.0.36) that my smbmounted
shares are performing very poorly compared with the transfer rates I
regularly obtain when FTPing, or even smbclient-ing to the same machine.  
  Have there been any weird changes to the kernel smb code? I am
personally using an NE2k ethercard, but others have observed the same
slowdowns with Tulip cards, so I think a NIC driver problem can be ruled
out.
  My system specs:
  486/66 running 2.0.36 with 16mb of RAM and two el-cheapo NE2ks (the
machine is basically a masq box).
  Any help would be much appreciated.
  Steve.
