I'm afraid that I'm not convinced.

I don't think that a return value from wait_on_prunes is meaningful.
All it tells us is whether a prune_one_dentry finished before or after
wait_on_prunes takes the spin_lock.  This isn't very useful
information as it has no significance to upper levels.
So:

Suppose shrink_dcache_parent misses on dentry because the inode was being
iput.  This iput completes immediately that
shrink_dcache_parent completes.  It decrements ->s_prunes and when
wait_on_prunes takes dcache_lock, ->s_prunes is zero so the loop
terminates, and the remaining dentries - the parents of the dentry
what was undergoing iput - don't get put.
I really think that we need to stop prune_one_dentry from being called
on dentries for a filesystem that is being unmounted.  With that code
currently in -git, that means passing a 'struct super_block *' into
prune_dcache so that it ignores any filesystem with ->s_root==NULL
unless that filesystem is the filesystem that was passed.
