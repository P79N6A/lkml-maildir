Everything in mm plus fs/buffer.c at least. (plus includes)  A good
place to start is with __alloc_pages().. that will drag you through
a lot of the balancing code.  Following entry points (sys_brk, sys_mmap
etc) is highly recommended.  Be prepared for dizzy spells if you've
never toured mm-land before :)
