You could have asked me for a patch against the x86 tree instead of 
forcing these into your tree. Then I could have made sure that everything 
is okay for your tests, I would have put the stuff into a git tree for you 
to pull etc. I'd be glad if you would test this but if at least if you get 
these kinds of rejects then its probably wise to stop and reconsider your 
approach.

Hostile? AFAICT this is not the usual way how things are handled with mm 
patches. Preparing a patch against mainline would take some doing.

Side swipe against mm? ;-) mm2 works fine here. What is so bad about mm?

I have tried to help you as best as I could in a endeavor that I 
expected to be fruitless while warning you not to go down that route.
I am in the same situation supposed to go on vacation from today till the 
12th. I took some hours to test your config and figure out how to clean up 
the mess.
