I know it's true. I have run the disk-destroyer program. Twice.
I compiled a 2.4.0-test5-pre2 kernel with an earlier version of Andre's
patch and actually ran the disk-destroyer program as a test. Andre
specifically did not include the fry-your-drive codes in the test
program, but on the first try it sucessfully hosed the MBR and partition
table (my /dev/hda1 was/is swap, so I don't know how much of that went
bye-bye too). After a fresh install of Red Hat 6.2, I (glutton for
punishment that I am) recompiled 2.4.0-test5-pre2 with the latest patch
(has it been restored to www.kernel.org?) and now my system can survive
the disk-destroyer (The drive still makes god awful noise when run, but
no permanant damage occurs). I captured the output of the disk-destroyer
and sent it to Andre with a list of my hardware (mobo & drive models) so
he could further refine the patch. I wish more people would get off
their high horses and help out in any way they can. I am a lowly
installation support technician an not a kernel-god who dreams code in
their sleep, but I will help in any way I can to improve Linux as a
whole. Will you?
