But I don't want to rewrite the disk access code of the emulator
either,
because I would have to duplicate that kernelcode into the application.
Besides it would have the same alias access to the *mounted* root
partition. Not that it would *intend* to go there, but a stray fseek
could
do some damage. Something that would be easier than a stray open:-).
Open _does_ check access rights.

If that partition isn't mounted there is no problem. The emulator does
the mount. If the emulator isn't running and I want to change some
Files,
then I *can* mount without problems.
There is another way. Make "partitions" a full
(pseudo)(read-only?)filesystem. So that "mount -t partitions /dev/hda
/dev/hd/a" and
"mount -t ext2 /dev/hd/a/1 /usr" works. Note that the blockdevice for
the partition is in logically in the full device. If this "partitions"
filesystem permits the writing of inodes, it could be a standard
interface for fdisk et al.
