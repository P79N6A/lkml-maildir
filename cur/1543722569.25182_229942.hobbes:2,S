Of course, if mozilla marked them "elastic" it should better be
prepared for they disappearance. I'd disappear them with simple
unlink(), so they'd physically survive as long as someone held them
open.

Probably just some of the files... Or you could delete directory, too,
if it was marked "elastic". What to delete first... probably file with
oldest access time? Or random file, with chance of being selected
proportional to file size?
I'm not implementing it, I'm just arguing that it is usefull.
