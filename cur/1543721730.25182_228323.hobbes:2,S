Grin, it won't be pretty, i_bdev can't be trusted without the bdev lock,
and I'll need to check for I_FREEING on it to make sure it isn't in
clear_inode.
The sequence leading up to all of this looks something like this:
CPU 0:					CPU 1: 
pdflush finds				umount /dev/sda1
FS inode for
/dev/sda1 in dirty list,
makes it's way down
to __sync_single_inode
mapping = inode->i_mapping
(this points bdev address
 space)
					kill_block_super
					close_bdev_excl
					blkdev_put
					bdput(bdev)
					iput(bdev->bd_inode)
					...
					clear_inode(bdev inode)
					bdev_clear_inode
					__bd_forget(inode for /dev/sda1)
					...
					destroy_inode(bdev inode)
...
do_writepages(mapping, wbc)
Since mapping on CPU0 still points to the bdev address space, and that
has been freed by the destroy inode, we run into problems.  
Maybe the real bug is the FS inode should never have ended up in the
dirty list.  This should all work fine if the bdev inode were the only
one to ever hit a dirty list.
