I think there is one more case that matters, which is briding
from a device with VLAN stripping for a VLAN not configured
locally. The tag will be stripped and will be lost for forwarded
packets. But I'm not exactly sure this really can be configured
(time for bed so I'll check tommorrow).

We have a two byte hole after tc_verd where we could fit this in.
But I'm pretty sure we also could reuse some other fields on input,
like queue_mapping or maybe even destructor for unowned skbs.
