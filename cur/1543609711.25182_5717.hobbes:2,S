Well I still think that the 8 lines can be deleted. Once again my famous
notbook is perfectly __i386__ and doesn't contain any devices served by
serial.c
unless I configure IrDA. Pushing the port numbers artificially behind
doesn't make sense for me and makes some setserial unknown tricks
neccessary
for irtty setup.
