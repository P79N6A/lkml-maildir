Nothing, as long as they work as required.  And Grzegorz Kulewski 
pointed out that unsigned long is required to be at least 32 bits, 
fulfilling the present need for a 32-bit or wider type.

If it leads to better code, then indeed it would be.  However, Al Viro 
disagrees and strongly hints they would lead to worse code.

And in this case there is such a requirement.  Anyway, I've already 
decided to use unsigned long as a replacement for uint_fast32_t in my 
implementation.
