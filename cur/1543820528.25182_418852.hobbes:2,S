Subject: [PATCH] Fix coredump vs exec deadlock
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/25/267

Fix a race between the coredump code and the exec dethreader that causes the
two to deadlock.
The problem is that if both events happen simultaneously (exec and death by
signal) in two different threads, both threads sit there waiting for the other
to die.
This patch makes exec inferior to death by signal, the dethreader for the
former aborting if it detects the latter.
I've also fixed a potential race in which de_thread() was doing a wait loop,
but with the setting of the task state _after_ the loop condition check.  I've
moved the task state set before the check.
