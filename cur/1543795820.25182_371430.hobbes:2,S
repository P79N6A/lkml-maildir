Subject: [PATCH 2.6.15-rc3] pci: restore 2 missing pci ids
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Somewhere between 2.6.14 and 2.6.15-rc3, some PCI ids were apparently removed.
The ecc.c module, which is not a part of the kernel.org tree, but included in
some distributions, fails to compile.
<soapbox>
I don't understand why valid PCI ids were removed. It seems to me that other
projects underway -such as EDAC - are just going to have to add these and
probably more of them back when they are merged. It seems really shortsighted
and foolish to remove valid PCI id information even if the current kernel
source happens to not reference it. The information has intrinsic value and
avoids having different names being associated with the same ids over time
by avoiding removing and adding PCI ids.
</soapbox>
I have included a patch below that fixes my immediate problem, but I think
I would prefer reverting the patch that removed them in the first place. Yes,
I know there is a whitespace error in this patch, but that is what is in the
file in -rc3 and I didn't want to turn this into a whitespace-correction patch.
Restore 2 PCI ids needed for ECC monitoring.
