Hi!
Something changed (in linux acpi code?) and brightness on thinkpad x60
can no longer be adjusted by fn-home/end keys.
/proc/acpi/ibm still works...
root@amd:/proc/acpi/ibm# echo level 0 > brightness
root@amd:/proc/acpi/ibm# echo level 7 > brightness
(This is not from clean boot, I did suspend to ram and some
powersaving stuff, so if it happens on your machine, too, let me
know.) It worked okay in 2.6.18 (even with suspends/etc).
