   Anyway, After looking at the SMP and UP configuration in pgalloc.h, could
   you simply remove the UP/SMP differentiation in the routines, as in my
   attachment?  It looks to me, that the struct for pgt_quicklist is built
   correctly for UP or SMP above this?  I could be wrong on this....
That would waste 3/4 of every page allocated for PGDs.
We use the pointers to keep track of which bits of the page
are allocated to PGDs.  So how about rewriting our code to
use bits in page->flags instead?
