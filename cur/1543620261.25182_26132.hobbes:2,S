Hi,
>-cp bzImage to /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.17

do you really mena bzImage or arch/i386/bootbzImage ? And it would be 
very helpful if you can provide the compile options. Without them or 
only with the information from your mail is hard to tell what is going 
wrong. Your compile settings are stored in the $LINUX_SRC/.config file. 
The way you did it though is correct. You culd skip mproper on a newly 
untarred kernel and the make clean after the first config but it doesn't 
hurt if you do it. The failure is in your .config probably.
Greets,
        Todor
