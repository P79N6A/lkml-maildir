They continue using more octet than bytes even in recent RFCs. I have read I
do not remember where that the goal was to avoid byte/bit confusion.
I am sorry, I did not intend to start an off-topic subthread. I think I
should stick with kB/MB/GB unless I already used the full word earlier.

So bad... Perhaps it was asking too much...

The man page (<URL:

 > for Solaris 10,
I believe OpenSolaris is based on it) tells briefly that the checked
inconsistencies are (I quote):
- Blocks claimed by more than one file or the free list
- Blocks claimed by a file or the free list outside the range of the file system
- Incorrect link counts in file entries
- Incorrect directory sizes
- Bad file entry format
- Blocks not accounted for anywhere
- Directory checks, file pointing to unallocated file entry and absence of a
  parent directory entry
- Descriptor checks, more blocks for files than there are in the file system
- Bad free block list format
- Total free block count incorrect
I do not know UDF at all, so I can not tell if this is enough or not.
As for the licence, it is the one of OpenSolaris <URL:
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/licensing/opensolaris_license/
 >, which is
free enough for the FSF to make efforts to have GPL3 compatible with it.
