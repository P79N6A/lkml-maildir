what you see is a open feedback cycle conducted on lkml. People send 
patches for arch/x86, and we tell them if it breaks something. The bug 
was found before i pushed out the x86.git devel tree (and the fix is 
below - but this shouldnt matter to you because the bug never hit a 
public x86.git tree).
