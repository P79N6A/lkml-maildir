The (theoretically) best 64-bit prime with 5 high bits I found is:
11673330234145374209 == 0xa200000000100001
which has continued fraction of p/2^64
	= 0,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1073740799,2,1,1,1,1,6,1,1,5,1023,1,4,1,1,3,3
and the (theoretically) best 64-bit prime with 4 high bits I found is:
11529215046068994049 == 0xa000000000080001
which has continued fraction of p/2^64
	= 0,1,1,1,2,549754765313,1,1,1,1,1,4095,2,1,1,1,1,2,1,2
(the continued fractions terminate after the points given here)
Which of the two would be better should depend on whether the penalty
against the distribution for the sixth term of the 4-bit prime is worse
than the computational expense of the extra shift/add for the 5-bit prime.
I need to start benching this stuff.
Cheers,
Bill
