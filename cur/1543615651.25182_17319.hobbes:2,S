The ACPI info comes from the BIOS. So, it's no more reliable than any
other BIOS, and probably less so than ones that do/did DMI, as there are
so many aspects to it.
I would suggest reading the ACPI spec at 
http://acpi.info
 and the Intel
implementation of it at
http://developer.intel.com/technology/IAPC/acpi/index.htm
for an idea of what it's supposed to do and what you can theoretically get
from it.
