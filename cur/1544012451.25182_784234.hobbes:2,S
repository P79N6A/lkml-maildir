Right. MMCplus and MMCmobile cards are all required to have
8 bit support, and they've been around for years. The catch
is that there have been essentially no controllers out in
the wild which can take advantage of them. Even when the
controller chip supports 8 bit operation, the ODM usually
only connects 4 pins up - and when they actually do, it's
for a controller which we don't know how to control :-)
This OMAP controller is a first.

True - except that CE-ATA wants to signal ATA command completion
on the CMD line which I'm fairly certain requires explicit
hardware level support. In the absence of that, you'd have to
poll.
