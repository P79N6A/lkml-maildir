Definately. It's always been illegal to call into the devfs API from
interrupt context, and in fact given that devfs_register() always
called kmalloc() with GFP_KERNEL, it should have caught any interrupt
context callers of devfs.
It just happened that in the old devfs core, you could often get away
with a call to devfs_unregister(), since it didn't do any allocations.
However, doing so was unsafe due to races (no locking/irq disabling),
even on UP systems. So it was always a driver bug to do this.

Sounds good to me. I look forward to seeing your patch in -rc3 :-)
