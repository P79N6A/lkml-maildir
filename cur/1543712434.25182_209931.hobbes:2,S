Hi Ivan, Hi Måns
I haven't found the time to look deeper into the problem. All what I can
say ATM is, it is real and exists!
Ivan, perhaps you can give me some useful advise how to debug this
successfully? I think we should begin to try isolating the problem to a
single part of the kernel. 
Is it possible that we have a deadlock in the VFS part? After a
while every process that accesses a file will be blocked (already
described).
Regards
Marc
