What for?  Did you see any problems with the way it works right now?
How it works now is that if the module is unloaded while the device is
in use, then the device is deregistered from the USB and ATM layers
before the module unload completes.  Thus there should be no problem
unloading the device at any moment.  I'm guessing that you want this
because of the better proc support you would like to add, which adds
an extra callback into the module.  This too should cause no problems
as long as the appropriate tweaks are made to the shutdown code.  I
plan to make those adjustments, but I didn't find time yet - sorry.
So this is a nack.
Best wishes,
Duncan.
