Hello all.
We've written a module for kernel 2.2.14 that includes a driver
for 2 "virtual" devices. These devices don't actually exist,
they're implemented with two circular buffers; what's written
into one of the devices is read from the other, and viceversa.
We believe the buffer is correctly written, but we have the
following problem: We can insmod, read, write, and rmmod, and
everything's OK. However, as soon as we logout we get 'INIT: Id
"n" respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes.', where "n" is
each of the consoles we were logged in at (5 minutes later, the
same message occurrs).
We have no idea what it could be, any pointers?
