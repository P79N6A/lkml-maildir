Subject: 2.6.10 IRQ 18 issues gone away

My ongoing issue with runaway IRQ 18 floods has gone away, although I am 
not totally sure they are "solved" in the usual sense. I flashed the 
latest BIOS from Asus and had various problems (P4P81019) then flashed 
one I got as a gift from a nameless source (P4P81086). That did the 
trick, all the IRQs are no longer shared, even though they worked 
perfectly as shared on 2.4.22-1.2199 (FC1) with the original BIOS.
Since the system worked with 2.4 and not with 2.6, even though a BIOS 
change made the problem go away, I suspect that there is still some 
issue with the shared IRQ, although I am certainly NOT interested in 
going back to help find it!
Many thanks to people who suggested BIOS upgrade as a workaround for the 
kernel, and pointed me at installing from CD instead of floppy (I don't 
have floppy). The system is now stable although there are a number of 
"not in 2.6" issues to solve eventually.
My new interrupt map if anyone cares:
