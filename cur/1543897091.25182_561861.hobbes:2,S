Just hoping to avoid a change collision. If I have to deal
with this today it's easy, if it doesn't show up anywhere
until 2.6.28 I'm breezing, but if it all hits in two weeks I
have some scrambling and yet another delay to deal with. Not
your problem, a little information would be helpful though.
BTW, I reviewed my notes from the early days of LSM and it
turns out that I agree with the notion that loadable modules
don't make a whole lot of sense. So long as I can choose
security models as easily as I can change file systems, I'm
reasonably happy. That, and that the "default" "regular"
policy isn't too terribly different from the traditional
Unix policy.
