That's why you have low and high watermarks and try to balance
the shrinking and allocating in both zones.  Not sure how
classzone would influence this balancing though, maybe it'd be
harder maybe it'd be easier, but I guess it would be different.

Remember that on large systems ZONE_NORMAL is often under much
more pressure than ZONE_HIGHMEM.  Need any more arguments ? ;)
