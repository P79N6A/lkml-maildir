Many thanks for taking care of this!
We already have a patch in -mm, s2ram-kill-old-debugging-junk.patch from Pavel
(
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm-commits&m=118737955611331&w=1
), that removes the
#ifdefed blocks and it clashes with your first patch a bit.
FYI, I have rebased your first patch on top of the Pavel's patch:
