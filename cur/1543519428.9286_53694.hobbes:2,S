Hi,

why should it be a no-op? E820 correctly detects the map and one of the 
entries has a length of 0 but type 1. I suspect not even Linux can
store serious amounts of data in 0 bytes of memory so it is reasonable to ignore it...
Is it not?
I mean if there was really no e820[7] entry there (physically) but Linux 
started to detect it at some point then it would be a real bug but now it 
is just a workaround for a particularly strange E820 configuration of 
this Compaq box.
Regards,
Tigran.
