Hmm, let me try to write it out
       A                B             C           D
    lock L1           lock L2       lock L3       lock L4
    lock L2           lock L3       lock L4
 traverse to C
 is preempted
                                                  unlock L4
                                    unlock L4
                                    unlock L3
                      unlock L3                   lock L4
                      unlock L2     lock L3
                      lock L3       lock L4
 Continue from C
Ok, I see the problem for _deadlock detection_.  There still is no problem
for PI.

It works for PI. It might give false positives for deadlock detection even
without signals involved. But that might be solved by simply checking
again. If it is stored on a task when they blocked on a lock it
could be seen if they had released and reobtained the task since the last
traversal.
If I should choose between a 100% certain deadlock detection and
rescheduling while doing PI I would choose that latter as that gives a
deterministic RT system. Are there at all applications depending on
deadlock detection or is it only for debug perposes anyway?
