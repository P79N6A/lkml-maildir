Because libgcc1.a is not installed with GCC.
libgcc.a is, but that includes libc-level calls.
A solution, though there doesn't seem to be a great need for one, is
this in linux/lib:
   libgcc=`gcc -print-file-name=libgcc.a`
   files=`ar t "$libgcc" | egrep '^_.*[qhsdt]i[234]?\.o$'`
   ar x "$libgcc" $files
   ar rcs libgcc.a $files
Link with the resulting local libgcc.a
