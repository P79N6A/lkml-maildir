Ok I ended up doing this after a little thought.  Thanks.
But I am seeing segfaults in mutt under 2.6 ext3 with 1k blocks, that I
don't see in 2.4, and didn't see under reiserfs.  I can try with 4k blocks,
if you'd like, is there anything I can do to capture more information that
could be happening to cause this?
And now mutt is segfaulting on non-htree directories too.
