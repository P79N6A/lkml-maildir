Both are internal -- Rockwell/ALS100. I get no complaints from the pnp
layer, other than a refusal to config one if the other modules is
loaded. Both want to use irq 5. I have pnpbios in too.
I have just fixed a problem with unloading the 8250_pnp module, so am
hoping I can delve into this a bit more.
It seems that pnp is only trying the first config option for the device
and then bailing out if that won't fit with what else is setup.
