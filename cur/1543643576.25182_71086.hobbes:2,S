Well, actually I didn't want to depict *him* as a looser. I was talking
about me :) I've already been confronted with message from the IDE
drivers (and that's when I see them. I'm not always at the console or
reading syslog) and I never remember if they are critical or harmless. I
have to either dig through lkml archives to find what they mean, or ask
lkml what do they mean (to the luser I am).
IDE error/status message aren't visible enough. I'd like to know when my
drive is near failing, without looking at syslog.
