I was always especially fond of the "du" entropy source with Solaris
installations of OpenSSH (the PRNG used commands like "du" too). It was
always amusing that a single network outage at the University would
prevent anyone from ssh'ing into the "UNIX" machines. So yeah, if we
want to take a giant leap backwards, I suggest jumping at this.
Lots of these are not actually random - you can guess the free space on
a network drive in some certain cases, you know what processes are
likely to be created on a LiveCD, and many dmesg outputs are very
similar, especially when there aren't precie timestamps included.
But I do think it's time some of this got addressed :-)
Cheers,
Jon.
