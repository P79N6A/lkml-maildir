Whee. For the first time ever I've started getting these:
TCPv4 bad checksum from 24.112.48.34:0015 to 61.8.17.172:072b, len=20/20/40
over my ppp connection. never happened before.
pre8/egcs 1.1.1/pppd 2.3.3
I remember there being discussion about something like this and
that it should be ignored or something but I'm not exactly sure
and these suckers are rather annoying when they pop up on
console and ruin the display. :/
