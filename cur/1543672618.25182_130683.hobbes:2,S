The below patch allows me to use the ATAPI MO drive read-only using 
ide-cd. It does not send the drive any commands it might not understand.
I'm still trying to get write support to work, but being able to read
from the drive is an independent feature and useful in itself, I think.
Would it be possible to apply this to 2.5?
Tested by reading an entire ext2 filesystem from an MO disk and comparing
against the result obtained from 2.4 with ide-scsi/sd. No differences.
Patch against 2.5-bkcvs.
