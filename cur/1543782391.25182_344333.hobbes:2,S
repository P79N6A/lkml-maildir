Hi Marcelo,

Patches 1/5, 3/5 and 4/5 are typo fixes in documentation and comments.
5/5 however qualifies as (minor) bug fix IMHO, as missing newlines in
log messages will cause the next message's log level not to be
interpreted as such.

I sent you these patches because I thought they were worth applying,
obviously, so don't ask me. Apply them or discard them as you feel like,
it's really up to you, not me. From that, I'll know what kind of patches
are worth sending next time.
Thanks,
