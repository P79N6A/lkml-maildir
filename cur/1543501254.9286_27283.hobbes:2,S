I wrote function into a kernel module that iterated through the current 
tasks for statistics purposes to /proc/mymod.  Following an example 
from the procfs sources, I used (un)read_lock(&tasklist_lock) during the 
time I was iterating throug them.
But a user using 2.2.10-smp complained that though he could compile my 
module fine, upon insmod'ing it he got this problem: 
   mymod-smp-2.2.10: unresolved symbol tasklist_lock
Is there a config flag in the kernel sources that would lead to this 
symbol not being created?  Perhaps he didn't compile in a /proc 
filesystem?  I was just wondering where exactly it was defined, and 
whether or not I have to tell him to enable a certain option, or if it's 
a deeper issue.  Thanks.
