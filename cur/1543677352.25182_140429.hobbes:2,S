Hi there!
Whenever I start a program that frequently polls for acpi-information 
(eg. the Gnome Battstat Monitor), my mouse goes wild. The cursor starts 
jumping and keeps dancing around until I kill the application.
I'm currently using kernel version 2.5.70 but I had the problem also in 
earlier versions.
Oh, my computer is a Acer Travelmate 220.
Do you need further information? Can you help me? ;)
Any help is appreciated.
