To be clear, I also meant the patches for the at91rm9200, where you
had added 'select GENERIC_TIME', I copied that to my at91sam9261
work-in-progress-patch...
I thought adding a clocksource was enough, but I am starting to doubt
about that now...
So, I dive into it some deeper tomorrow morning.
I believe I also have to implement a clockevents implementation
also... (for GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS)
Thanks for your help!
(If I have something working, I will publish it, maybe you can use it
also for your work/patch?)
Kind Regards,
Remy Böhmer
