This routine actually renumbers gsi's. I don't think you can kill
ioapic_renumber_irq without bringing down ES7000 that have swapped
legacy/PCI ranges and are still out there. Moreover, mach-es7000
purpose is to define and use the range swapper on the first ioapic.
Kernel still assumes legacy mapping having no overrides of that
extent. Perhaps the real fix is to have ACPI/MPS parsers to read the
actual pin/gsi information from the tables, which turned out pretty
difficult last time we tried.
