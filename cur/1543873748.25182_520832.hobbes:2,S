it is, but mainly because a 'context' in the Linux-VServer
case is a struct, which defines all the properties for a
'guest' excluding separate (name)spaces. as the pid space
doesn't exist yet, it is part of the task grouping context

looks good to me, except for the potential issue with
the double indirection introducing too much overhear
(compared to something like this:
       ipc uts
        ^   ^   .
        |   |   ¦
    +---+---+---+---+  
    |    nsproxy    | 
    +------------+--+   cpu pid
                 ^       ^   ^
                 |       |   |	
             +---+-------+---+--+
             |       task       |
             +------------------+
don't forget, accounting for cpu is probably very closely
tied to tasks, while this doesn't matter much for other
resources like number of tasks or file handles ...

I agree here, just let us keep some way to actually 
check _how_ much overhead we add with nsproxy, etc
