EFI framebuffer doesn't depend on EFI runtime service.
But EFI variable service depends on EFI runtime service, and most people
think it is useful. It can be used to:
- Provide a standard method to communicate with BIOS, such as specifying
the boot device or bootloader for the next boot.
- Provide a standard method to write the OOPS information to flash.
To improve the reliability of OOPS information writing, the virtual mode
of EFI should be used. And through mapping all memory area used by EFI
to the same virtual address across kexec, EFI can work with kexec under
virtual mode just like that of IA-64.
So, I think the EFI runtime service is useful and it does not break
anything. But the code duplication between efi_32.c and efi_64.c should
be eliminated and I will work on this.
