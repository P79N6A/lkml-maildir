Nope.  It's a useful technique that I was reminded of recently by DaveM.
Have you ever looked at the -nasty- include nesting that occurs because
key kernel headers include other key kernel headers all the time?  Its
way past time to reverse that trend.  Using "struct foo;" at the
beginning of the header simply passes on the task of including the
definiton for 'struct foo' down the line, avoiding another level of
include nesting.
But... that said.  Provided no other kernel code is similarly broken,
your fix to md.c, Neil, is definitely superior to adding includes and
'struct file;' to sysctl.h.
