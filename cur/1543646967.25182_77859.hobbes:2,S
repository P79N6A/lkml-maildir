If having only "a few" block groups really work better 
(even for todays bigger disks) then bigger
block groups seems like a solution.
changing the on-disk format might not be popular, but there
is no need for that.  Simply regard several on-disk block
groups as a bigger "allocation group" when using the above
algorithm.  This should be perfectly backwards compatible.
