Ok, neither of you had any of those special quirks in use, just the 
standard ACPI/SMB quirk that we've been aware of for a long time.
It's quite possible (and even likely) that they are mainly used on 
laptops. The main reason to use those magic device resource quirks is 
because of something like a simple ISA'ish special device like a LCD 
brightness controller or special button hardware.
So for example, it would be interesting to see somebody with a Sony VAIO 
laptop with the magic SonyPI device. That's exactly the kind of thing that 
might be decoded by a southbridge quirk.
But keep the reports coming. Even a "nothing shows up" report is actually 
rather encouraging in the sense that if I turn the printk() into a real 
PCI resource setting quirk, at least it won't break anything on hardware 
like yours ;)
Thanks,
