ok, i see the flaw in my logic.  the Kconfig variable 405EX isn't
tested *directly* by anyone, it's simply used to further "select"
other variables, which my script doesn't take into account.
  config 405EX
        bool
        select IBM_NEW_EMAC_EMAC4
        select IBM_NEW_EMAC_RGMII
i don't think i'm quite ready to add that logic to a simple scanning
script.
oh, well.
