Subject: Real Time Traffic Flow Measurement - anybody working on it?

Through the stimulating discussion we had under ``IP Acounting 
Idea for 2.5'', it appears that a separate Traffic Flow Measure-
ment and Accounting sub-system would be useful. See:
        <
http://logi.cc/linux/CounterReset/>
If anybody is working on Real Time Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM)
please reply.
I would also like to know if there are any objections to providing
a RTFM interface in the kernel (as an optional module).
FYI:
Considerable work has already been done on RTFM in general and 
for other systems:

Relevant RFCs include: 2720 ... 2724
Thanks
