My best recommendation still stands:  remove chipset tuning completely
from the kernel, at least for x86 systems (SPARCs may need it simply
to finish booting).
The complex task of chipset and drive mode matching is way too big,
and way too fast changing, to cast in stone in a kernel driver.
Move it to userland, add a nice pretty gui for the X-Gen crowd,
and stop fussing over it!   
Well, you *did* ask..   :)
