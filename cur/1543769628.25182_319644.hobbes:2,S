First of all, yes, we are talking about busy waits:
The CF cards run in PIO mode, i.e. the CPU polls and copies the data,
and we know from measurements that this causes 100 % CPU load and
blocks anything at lower prio for extended periods.
Of course, in some cases you are in big trouble anyway 
if some RT process in a control system dumps core,
and it will not matter any more at which prio core is dumped.
However, it might also be a non-critical part of the system,
and in this case, other parts should continue at normal rate.
If some part of the system which was designed to occupy the cpu
exclusively for let's say at most 50 microseconds suddenly 
monopolizes it for 5 seconds, that will cause surprises...
Moreover, the lowest-pri parts of a control system are usually the
graphical user interfaces. We are talking about core dump times
in the order of 5 or 10 seconds, and the operators will panic madly
if the system does not react to any user interaction and does not
update its display for that long.
Similarly, log daemons should spread word about the problem 
immediately, not 10 seconds late.
So we are not yet at the question how to recover and how to
continue. 
First of all, 
we want to survive the core dumping itself gracefully, 
we don't want to increase damage by dumping core, 
and we want to be able to inform and take action about the trouble
before the core has finished dumping.
