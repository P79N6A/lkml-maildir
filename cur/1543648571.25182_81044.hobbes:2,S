Then stabilize your interface before going into production use.  Why
should selinux (or lsm) get special treatment?

It's not the performance issues, it's about getting a proper syscall table
instead of deep nesting without knowing what it actually does.
Look at e.g. the horrors of doing a proper 32->64bit translation
of those syscalls.

Yes.  In general you should avoid adding syscalls anyway. If we
wanted to make it easy we'd have created loadable syscalls from the very
beginning.
