I stand corrected :)  However, I think it's a tangent:
dontdiff is a file that's useful precisely because of the form its in. 
So, as something that's proven itself useful to a bunch of people, I 
definitely think it has a home somewhere in Documentation/*  It need not 
be referenced in any way by kbuild; that's not a big deal.  The two 
really serve different purposes.
