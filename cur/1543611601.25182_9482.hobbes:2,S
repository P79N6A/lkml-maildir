Has anyone attempted to add framebuffer support for the GeForce3 into the
prexisting riva fb drivers? I tried just added the PCI ID and adjusting all
the tables, but when I loaded the driver, the picture looked like the bit
depths or something was off. I also coudln't find any documentation to try
hacking it my self. Anyone know what the differences are between the 2D in
the GeForce2 and GeForce2 are?
