I've not said it has 'fixed' my problem - I said it has exposed the
problem much faster.
But now when I've made a double test - I think I was wrong - I've been
probably judging too fast and its also probably depending on the
sunlight position, but now I can see that even with recent git kernel
without your patch I get the busy loop pretty quick :(.
