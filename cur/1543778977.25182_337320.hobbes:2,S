To add one to Linus' list, note that all current AMD & Intel chips
record instruction boundaries in L1 cache, either predecoding on
L1 cache load, or marking the boundaries on first execution.
The P4 takes it to an extreme, but P3 and K7/K8 do it too.
The result is that there are additional instruction decode limits
that apply to cold-cache code.
