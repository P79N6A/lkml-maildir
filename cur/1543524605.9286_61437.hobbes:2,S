Subject: Journaling FS in 2.3?

Hi.
What (if any) journaling FS options are available under a 2.3 kenrel? I
tried finding both reiserFS and ext3, but there don't seem to be any 2.3.*
versions.
Any help (on the list or by private email) is greatly appreciated.
I'm not running a production environment, so if any of the developers need
people to test extremely unstable patches, i'd have no problem with that
*grin*.
I'm mainly wanting to write a review of the journaling options available
in linux, and benchmarks etc for my local LUG.
If someone has a good pointer to references on what journaling is in
layman's terms, that would be very helpful.
Thanks very much,
--buddy
