No.  This is a Pentium 4 - single core, 2.8GHz.

Not sure how windows applies here; I only use Linux.  The main data 
point so far is that the card works fine when on the primary PCI bus but 
locks up hard after a few minutes when installed in a slot behind a PCI 
to PCI bridge.  I can provide the dmesg info on Monday.
