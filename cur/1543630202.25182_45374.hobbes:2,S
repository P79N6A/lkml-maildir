Subject: [PATCH] 1a/6: get_jiffies64() for George Anzinger's approach
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Dooh.
George Anzinger just started a new thread on how to do 64 bit jiffies
while I prepared my split-up patch for Linus.
Well, since the patch is split up we just have to replace part 1/6,
patches 2/6 - 5/6 still apply. The debug option 6/6 needs to be
redone, though.
This patch is supposed to be applied on top of George Anzinger's patch.
It just introduces a get_jiffies64() function that exports 64 bit jiffies
with correct locking, which is needed on 32 bit platforms but superfluous
on 64 bit. Patches 2/6 - 5/6 use this interface only.
