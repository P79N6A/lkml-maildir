To my knowledge, EGCS implements the entire ANSI C++ language.  (I may
be misinformed, of course.)
On the other hand, the C++ *library* that ships with EGCS,
a.k.a. "libstdc++", is quite deficient.
On the gripping hand, work on libstdc++ proceeds apace.

I agree that MI is not a good general-purpose tool.  But it has
specific limited value in specific limited cases.  One nice idiom,
for example, is mix-ins with MI and abstract classes.  (This is the
closest thing in C++ to Java's "interface" feature, AFAIK.)
