Subject: [pm] Make software resume be called at resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi!
This adds neccessary initcall() so that machine really does resume,
and adds gpl, and makes sure we do not do random bit flips on non-PSE
machine. Please apply,
								Pavel
[Yes, software_suspend needs to return int and do some error
handling. But not today, and this is better than random bit flips.]
PS: echo -n mem > /sys/power/state works here (good!), but echo 3 >
/proc/acpi/sleep fails to even put machine to sleep.
