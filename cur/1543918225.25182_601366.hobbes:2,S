I mean any writers and a fast block device (raid or otherwise).

Sure, but I'm asking about the effect of the patches on the
(avg-write-speed == device-capabilities) case. I agree that
they are necessary for timely syncing of data but I'm trying
to understand what effect they have on the normal write case
(i.e. keeping the disk at full write throughput).

Which queue are you talking about here? The block deivce queue?

True, but if we know we are not congested and have more work
to do, why sleep at all?

I'm interested to know what tests show that pushing more I/O when
you don't have block device congestion make the system go mad (and
what mad means).  It sounds to me like it's hiding (yet another)
bug in the writeback code......
Cheers,
Dave.
