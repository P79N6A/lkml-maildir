Let's make sure I understand: So you suggest skipping discover
altogether in case it is already reserved?

We can just wipe out the return value right now. Note that it was a
choice, it would only lead to code duplication if the hypervisor
wanted it. But yeah, I understand your concern. They may chose to
return 1 here just to change some tiny thing in the bottom.
I don't know exactly what other kinds of hooks we could put there.
lguest surely didn't need any. Are you okay with just turning it into
void by now ?
