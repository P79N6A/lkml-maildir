The sys_sync is unnecessary in the first case. There shouldn't be 
anything in the suspend path that's going to require userspace access to 
a device after that device has been suspended.

There's nothing wrong with it as such, it's just that our implementation 
appears to suck in a myriad of small ways that keep cropping up and 
biting people. Even without the sys_sync(), freezing processes results 
in the suspend failing because syslog is stuck in D state and won't go 
into the refrigerator.
