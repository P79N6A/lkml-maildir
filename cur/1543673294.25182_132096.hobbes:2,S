It should be possible to add vmap() and vunmap() to kernel/vmalloc.c
on older kernels.  I think those are the only dependencies (apart from
PAGE_AGP, which is taken care of by the latest patch).

Is there someone else on this list who would be able to look into
backporting vmap()/vunmap() to 2.4?  I don't use 2.4 with any
regularity anymore, but I suppose if nobody else is interested, I
could look into it.

Great!  Does this mean that next time Linus does a pull he'll pick up
this stuff?
