Problem is killing inlined functions. Current kernel relies in the
real version of the funtion staying there even all its uses have been
inlined. GCC's before 3 do not do what they are supposed to and do not
kill the real function. GCC3 kills it in certain cases and build
crashes. So kernel builds ok with old gcc's because they do not do
what they are supposed. Hence all the 'extern inline' mesh...
(plz, correct me if I'm wrong).
