Hi Joe, 
Thanks for your reply.
Which package I should look for then? 
I already tried to search for kernel packages at the
very beginning. Not sure whether I did that right-- I
search for 'kernel', 'kernel headers', 'kernel source'
under Mandrake package update. 
I was told that an about 13 M kernel was already
installed, including kernel headers under '/boot', 
and something like 'kernel-doc' under /lib. 
I'm using ltmodem-6.00b15.tar.gz
(
http://www.heby.de/ltmodem
).  It has a required-file
list. I checked it and got all files installed, except
a GNU C library, which doesn't exist in 2.4 version.
When I start ./build_module to build the driver, it
looks for kernel headers under some non-exist
directories like '/usr/src/linux'. 
I made such a directory, linked or even copied the
kernel header file from /boot to it;  I also tried to
put that header file under
/usr/src/linux/kernel-headers/ or rename the header
files or something..  No matter what it just told me
can't find the kernel headers.
I almost gave up, then I saw some suggestion to get
the kernel source from 'www.kernel.org'... After I
installed that, I now have a /usr/src/linux directory
and others. But.. well, then I come here :(
Anyway, now I just try to get that mkdep.c file from
another kernel version and see whether it can replace
my version.
Thanks again,
alal
