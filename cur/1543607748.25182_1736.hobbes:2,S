A couple of months ago I thought about this and could think of two 
possible solutions:
o add a __moddevtable which expands to __devinitdata 
  __attribute((unused)).
  Drawback: Needs changing of all drivers which produce the warning.
o add a variable which references the table within MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE. 
  I implemented this, minor drawback is that it costs 4 bytes per table. 
  However, IIRC Keith didn't like it at this time.
The best option, of course, is to move drivers to the new-style pci or 
whatever interface, such that the table actually gets used. But the 
middle of a stable series is not necessarily the best time to do so.
