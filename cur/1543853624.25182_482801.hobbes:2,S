I know the Sangoma S518 also uses a binary blob for the ADSL component
for I guess the same reason.  At least they maintain their drivers so
their cards work with current kernels (as long as you use one of the
architectures they compile the binary blob for).
Stupid secret libraries. :(
Of course claiming such drivers are GPL is nonsense in my opinion.
