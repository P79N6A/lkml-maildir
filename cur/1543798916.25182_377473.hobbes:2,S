In a hour or so, I will be in bed.  I'll look at it tomorrow, I have too
much on my plate to pull an "Ingo" and stay up till (what?) 4am pumping
out patches (Actually, I did that last night).
Way to go Ingo!  I'll take a closer look at all your stuff tomorrow.
kr, I'll look at your capture tomorrow as well.  I'll try to do what I
can and give Ingo a break.  He deserves it.
