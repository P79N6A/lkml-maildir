The latter.   If IRQ_PER_CPU is set, IRQ_DISABLED is not checked
in __do_IRQ(), so the handler is always called.  It is not a race
condition type thing where a few pended interrupts get handled after
IRQ_DISABLED is set.
My assumption is that setting IRQ_PER_CPU should not change the
behavior of IRQ_DISABLED.
disable_irq_nosync() does call chip->disable() to provide a chipset
specific interface for disabling the interrupt.  That avoids
the issue by having the chipset not issue the interrupt.  If a 
disable handler is required to disable the interrupt, then setting
IRQ_DISABLED is not necessary (and misleading).  
I think the intended behavior is for chip->disable() to 
disable the interrupt in the chipset.  If, for some reason,
the interrupt cannot be disabled in the hardware, the IRQ_DISABLED
would prevent the interrupt handler from being called.
