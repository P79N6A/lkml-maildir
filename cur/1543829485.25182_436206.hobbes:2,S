:)
So 10% of the male population need to learn
traffic light positions rather than colours?
I'm red/green colour blind which means I can't
distinguish _subtley_ different shades of red and green.
vim is another fondue fork offender as it merges
syntax highlighting and diff colours in diff mode (vimdiff).
I put the following in ~/.vimrc to disable that madness:
if &diff
    "I'm only interested in diff colours
    syntax off
endif
