Avoiding the runtime assignment isn't possible if you want a generic 
subarch that truly can run on multiple different platforms.
I prefer runtime assignment not for this reason, but simply because it 
also eliminates two artifacts:
1) You can add new subarch hooks without breaking every other 
sub-architecture
2) You don't need #ifdef SUBARCH_FUNC_FOO goo to do this (renaming 
voyager_halt -> default)
