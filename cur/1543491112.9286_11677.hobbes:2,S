Tried mv zImage-2.2.1 vmLinux-2.2.1 mkbootdisk 2.2.1   --?  (If you
moved zImage-2.2.1 back to zImage, adjust accordingly)  Or perhaps it
wants to see a RedHat style patch number as well:  vmLinux-2.2.1-0.1 or
so?  I don't have RedHat installed, so I don't have mkbootdisk, and I'm
just guessing, but how else does it know to get from a version number to
a file name???  Read man mkbootdisk?  If you have the command, there
_should_ be a manpage for it.
