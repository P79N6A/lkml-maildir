Do you want a guinea pig? I have a system with an Asus A7V motherboard
(with both via82xxxx and PDC20265 controllers) and also a notebook with
a 440BX/ZX chipset.
I'm willing to trash some installations of mine.
Hope this helps if you're looking for stupid^w^w^w^w^w^wbrave users. :-)
Thanks, Rogério.
