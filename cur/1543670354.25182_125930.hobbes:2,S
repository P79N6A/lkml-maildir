I think we can almost do it now.  Just a few things like get_user_pages(),
ptrace and core dumping may need to be taught about VM_RESERVED.
Or we could simply change mmap_mem() to set VM_IO if any of the pages aren't
valid.  That's probably an accurate reflection of what the app is trying to
do, too.
