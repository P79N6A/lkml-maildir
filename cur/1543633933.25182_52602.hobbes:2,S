I don't think that the text console with 16 different colors needs more
precision than 5 bits per color channel (speaking of RGB555).
However, using directcolor to have a gamma ramp in user space applications
seems quite useful.
Drivers should support both direct- and truecolor for all bit depths with
default to truecolor, otherwise applications would always have to setup
the palette.
Anyway, the current version of the cyber2000 driver reports directcolor
while programming the hardware for truecolor. I can do another patch
that keeps the directcolor feature along with the other fixes.
