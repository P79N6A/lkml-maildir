No hardware SAS chip I know of needs any of those legacy limitations.
Neither BCM8603 nor Fusion MPT.
Those limitations are purely Parallel SCSI.
I just included it, to show proof of concept -- when the architecure and
layering is correct, how easy it is to do it.  But you're right, it is
not needed.

This is exactly the rule I followed when developing the SAS Transport
Layer for Linux.  Furthermore, _that_ rule, to never overengineer, I learned
from Linux.  Sadly the politics are too deep and that rule applies only
to what is convenient, at least in Linux SCSI.
