Hi Ingo,
Thnx a lot for theses backports...
Ran into this while compiling a 2.6.23.8 with CFS v24
Compiling with CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED disabled :
kernel/sysctl.c:305: error: 'sysctl_sched_min_bal_int_shares' undeclared here (not in a function)
kernel/sysctl.c:313: error: 'sysctl_sched_max_bal_int_shares' undeclared here (not in a function)
I made that patch to make it compile.

Compiling with CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED enabled I get that errors. I have applied other patches, and may be an interaction. I will try to confirm that later :
