AFAICT, there is a bug either in the version of GRUB that is distributed with 
FC2 or in the FC2 installer.  I've heard people complaining that the FC2 GRUB 
prevents WinXP from booting when installed, although I've installed SuSE 
along with XP for many times with no such problems.
The workaround seems to be not to install GRUB and use LILO if you need a 
dual-boot system with FC2.
