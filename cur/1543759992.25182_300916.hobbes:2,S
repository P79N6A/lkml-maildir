And as I mentioned a few times, the authors have neither the inclination
nor the ability to do that, because they are not kernel hackers.  The
realtime LSM was written by users (not developers) of the kernel, to
solve a specific real world problem.  No one ever claimed it was the
correct solution from the kernel POV.
I know Jack disagrees but I for one am glad to see the max-RT-prio
rlimit patch going in.  This probably reflects my sysadmin background,
PAM does not scare me at all.  Anyway it solves the same problem and
will be invisible to any user with a reasonable distro.  If musicians
end up having to tweak the PAM configuration, then I would say the
distro has failed miserably.
