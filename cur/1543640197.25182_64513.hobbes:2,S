Ah, of course, that's what Denis Vlasenko was talking
about, now I see.
Clicks are caused by disabled ints, but whine is another
problem.
Recalling my old 386 board where I tried similar driver
under DOS and it also produced high pitched tone so I
ended up adding a capacitor, which solved the problem.
Now I think that the better solution is to add an option
to use higher modulation rates.
I have added an option to use 36KHz instead of 18.5KHz.
I beleive that this is far above the frequency range of
any motherboard and can solve the problem.
Andrew Rodland, could you please test the new patch from
my page and see if enabling the high freq modulation fixes
your problem, at least whine, not clicks?
