spose so.  It would allow an unprivileged app to force lots of order-3
allocations, which can make page reclaim do a lot of work.  Still...

I think we can do a version which omits the kmalloc altogether:
/*
 * insert suitable comment here
 */
int bitmap_parse_kernel(const char *ubuf, unsigned int ubuflen,
        unsigned long *maskp, int nmaskbits)
{
	int c, old_c, totaldigits, ndigits, nchunks, nbits;
	u32 chunk;
	bitmap_zero(maskp, nmaskbits);
	nchunks = nbits = totaldigits = c = 0;
	do {
		chunk = ndigits = 0;
		/* Get the next chunk of the bitmap */
		while (ubuflen) {
			old_c = c;
			if (__get_user(c, ubuf++))
				return -EFAULT;
(Note the s/get_user/__get_user/)
int bitmap_parse_user(const char __user *ubuf, unsigned int ubuflen,
        unsigned long *maskp, int nmaskbits)
{
	if (!access_ok(VERIFY_READ, ubuf, ubuflen))
		return -EFAULT;
	return bitmap_parse_kernel((const char *)ubuf, ubuflen,
					maskp, nmaskbits);
}
(Does typecasting a __user char * to a char * make sparse happy?)
