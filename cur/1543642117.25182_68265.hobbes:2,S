As I stated before, yes, it's artificial, but it is easy to come up with
real-world scenarios that come close. (proxy<->router<->webserver).

I don't know. After all, users expect that if they set hashsize=4096,
the hashsize will be 4096. It should be possible to use that setting
without suffering extreme performance losses. IMO the right thing for
now is take the port numbers out of the ntohl() function.

Right. But as stated above, making certain hash sizes impossible would
change the usage. Are we sure that there are no user-space tools out
there that rely on the hashsize being equal to what they specify when
the module is loaded?
I think the hash function should be fixed, not the possible choice of
hash sizes, if that is at feasible.
