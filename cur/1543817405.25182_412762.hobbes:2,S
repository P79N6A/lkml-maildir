I am suggesting that "There are no such situations anymore in an optimal 
userlevel implementation" is not the right approach to the original 
post. What I would do differently is to evaluate the original suggestion 
to see if it would in fact be more efficient. Please read the original 
post and take it on merit, it's either an optimizationn or not, and 
obviously it's used even if not by some "optimal" user code.
