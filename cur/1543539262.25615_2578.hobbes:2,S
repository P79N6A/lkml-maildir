Does the elevator tuning program elvtune work with Kernel version 
2.4.0-test4?
I thought I would give it a try but when I run it, the appropriate IOCTL
doesnt seem to be supported. It just gives me an io error.
This is the first 2.4 kernel I have tried, so I don't know when it
stopped working. Assuming of course that I havent done anything silly.
I couldnt see any configure options to enable the elevator stuff.
