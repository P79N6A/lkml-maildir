The LPAT is a demanding but fair test reflecting the tasks of a programmer or analyst.
The LPAT is a test that measures a job applicant's potential rather than his/her knowledge of a specific computer language.  It helps you compare your applicants with each other and with national norms.
The LPAT provides accurate, quantified, systematic information about your candidates mental abilities, going beyond what resumes, GPAs and interviews can tell you.
Upon completion of the test, a score report is produced with an overall score and with sub-scores.
