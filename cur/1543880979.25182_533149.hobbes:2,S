Not exactly.  The Linux MADV_DONTNEED never throws away data from a
PROT_WRITE,MAP_SHARED mapping (or shm) - it propagates the dirty bit,
the page will eventually get written out to file, and can be retrieved
later by subsequent access.  But the Linux MADV_DONTNEED does throw away
data from a PROT_WRITE,MAP_PRIVATE mapping (or brk or stack) - those
changes are discarded, and a subsequent access will revert to zeroes
or the underlying mapped file.  Been like that since before 2.4.0.
