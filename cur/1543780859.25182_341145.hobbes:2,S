Yes, and I can also report that teletext decoding has ceased to work
here.  But I'm not sure what kernel version killed it.  Currently
running 2.6.13-rc6.  But my card is cx88 based, a pcHDTV-3000.  But
attempting to switch it on/off doesn't seem to generate any output
indicating it failed, it just Doesn't Work(TM)
