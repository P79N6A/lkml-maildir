install.sh contains the following lines:
if [ -x ~/bin/installkernel ]; then exec ~/bin/installkernel "$@"; fi
if [ -x /sbin/installkernel ]; then exec /sbin/installkernel "$@"; fi
So you should look in the distribution specific installkernel files.
I do not see anything in install.sh that could result in the error above.
