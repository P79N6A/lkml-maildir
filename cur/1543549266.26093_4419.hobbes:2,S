*blink*  I confess that I can't see that much of a requirement for the
ptrace stuff, but I take your word for it. :)

Not really something that I would have thought was needed -
specifically, the userspace libraries that the process was dynamic
linked to would have been the place to do that, I thought.

That, however, is a convincing reason.

I can't, in honesty, see why you would want to do them as a GDI server.
However, if you did, yes, there would be a high cost. That would be one
of the reasons that I, personally, would have avoided that method.

IIRC there are not any waitable GHI objects, precisely because under
Win32 the GDI is a userspace library that does most of the magic
internally and then, finally, requests that the server does something.
Like sockets, the GDI isn't actually a Win32 kernel thing, it's a Win32
userspace wrapper that makes the minimalist kernel support more
palatable.

Well, that's a point of view thing. The native NT API isn't anything
beyond kernel32, as such. Certainly, the GDI isn't part of the core API
and, in some cases, MicroSoft do release or use the NT core without the
GUI system, at the least.
Anyhow, I am hardly an expert on the area, but... I would have avoided
putting stubs into the kernel anywhere that it was possible and used the
userspace dynamic Win32 libraries to do most of the work.
OTOH, I would also have implemented the WaitFor* set as a wrapper over
select, with the kernel module providing suitable file descriptors for
adding to the set that you waited for.
We have fairly different views on how this stuff would hang together
and, in all likelyhood, mine are based on incorrect assumptions. :)
Thanks for answering the questions,
