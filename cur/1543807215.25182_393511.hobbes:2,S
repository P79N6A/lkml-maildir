My personal view is that:
1) turning the freezing of kernel threads upside-down is not necessary and
would cause problems in the long run,
2) the todo lists are not necessary and add a lot of complexity,
3) trying to treat uninterruptible tasks as non-freezeable should better be
avoided (I tried to implement this in swsusp last year but it caused vigorous
opposition to appear, and it was not Pavel ;-))

As I have already stated, in my view this one is at least worth considering
in the long run.

Because it does not deadlock?  I will say we need this if I see a testcase
showing such a deadlock clearly.
