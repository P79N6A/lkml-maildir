Please could you change this to #if defined(CONFIG_VT) && !defined(CONFIG_DUMMY_KEYB) ?
Marcelo, I'd like this one to be merged, as it is useful to many of us, and
is already fixed in 2.6 (where you're not forced to have a keyboard). It's
not intrusive and at most a build fix. Would you please accept Nick's patch
after the little clean-up above ?
Thanks in advance,
Willy
