Hello list,
the following commands all "work":
	cat /proc/net/route | while read line; echo $line; done
	cat /proc/net/dev | while read line; echo $line; done
	while read line; echo $line; done </proc/net/dev;
The one that does not work is:
	while read line; echo $line; done </proc/net/route;
which only returns one line. Does anybody know what is causing this?
(Please CC, as I am not currently on the list.)
Regards,
