Hmm.. You need to tell sparse _some_ way which one you use, since sparse 
won't do it.
Picking one at random is fine, of course. It doesn't even have to match 
the one you'll compile with, although that means that sparse will 
obviously be testing a different configuration than the one you'd actually 
compile.
So I think having -D__BIG_ENDIAN__ in the sparse flags is better than not
having anything at all (since otherwise it won't be able to check
anything). And having something that matches the compiler would be better
still.
