"obviously"?
Take a look at some common traffic. Yes, even in servers. 
Small packets are not unlikely.
And even if you add extra code to _not_ do it for small packets, what
you're basically doing is slowing down the path - and increasing your
icache footprint etc quite noticeably, because suddenly you have two
mostly independent paths.
And the bugs get interesting too.
Also, you ignored the fact that the 128 can be 256 or 512. AND you ignored
the fact that I was being very generous indeed to the page table walking
case. So the 128 can end up being quite close to the page size. Or more.

Yeah.
And such a card doesn't actually exist. At least not in copious numbers.
You need megabytes of memory to hold stuff like that for a busy server. A
few hundred connections with a few kB of queued-up, unacked data.
Face it, it's not realistic. Sure, such cards exist. How many people have
ever _seen_ one?

Blame the API's.
Face it, complexity almost _never_ pays off.
