I started working on the rudimentary io prio code, and it got me thinking...
Why use the cpu scheduler priorities? Wouldn't it make more sense to add
io_prio to task_struct? This way you can have a process which you know needs
a lot of CPU but not as much io, or the other way around.
What do you think?
