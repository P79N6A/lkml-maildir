OK.  First of all, I have serious problems with collecting all these
stats to hd_struct.  Reasons:
	a) _all_ stats you collect by request will be for entire disk.
By the time when request had been created, we simply don't remember
which partition it used to be.  Pretending that they are per-partition
only obfuscates the things.  Stats by bio are per-partition, but... see below
	b) hd_struct had been completely removed from drivers (they neither
know nor care about it) and it will be completely gone RSN.  There will be
a replacement, obviously, but it's not even certain that it will be a
single array.

	It might.  There is a big rewrite of that area going on right now.
In particular, we are getting to the point when _all_ block devices are
going to acquire gendisks - partitioned or not.  Next step after that
will be sane refcounting for gendisks and once that is done we are getting
rid of get_gendisk() for good - pointer will be cached in struct block_device
while it's open _and_ it will replace ->rq_dev in struct request.
	These changes alone can cause a lot of fun, and then there is
reorganization of struct gendisk itself...
