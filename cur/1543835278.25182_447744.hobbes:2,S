Subject: [KJ] audit return code handling for kernel_thread [5/11]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Audit/Cleanup of kernel_thread calls, specifically checking of return codes.
    Problems seemed to fall into 3 main categories:
    1) callers of kernel_thread were inconsistent about meaning of a zero return
    code.  Some callers considered a zero return code to mean success, others took
    it to mean failure.  a zero return code, while not actually possible in the
    current implementation, should be considered a success (pid 0 is/should be
    valid). fixed all callers to treat zero return as success
    2) caller of kernel_thread saved return code of kernel_thread for later use
    without ever checking its value.  Callers who did this tended to assume a
    non-zero return was success, and would often wait for a completion queue to be
    woken up, implying that an error (negative return code) from kernel_thread could
    lead to deadlock.  Repaired by checking return code at call time, and setting
    saved return code to zero in the event of an error.
    3) callers of kernel_thread never bothered to check the return code at all.
    This can lead to seemingly unrelated errors later in execution.  Fixed by
    checking return code at call time and printing a warning message on failure.

Neil
