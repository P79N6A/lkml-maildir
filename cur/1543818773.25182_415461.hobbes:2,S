Hi Greg, Russel, Dmitry.
ALSA is using platform_device_register_simple(). Jean Delvare pointed:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113398060508534&w=2
out, where _simple looks to be slated for removal. Is this indeed the 
case? ALSA isn't using the resources -- doing a manual alloc/add would 
not be a problem...
Rene.
