I dont know if it was not reported yet or not fixed yet.
It apeared about in version 2.6.20.xx or there about so it is broken already 
awhile.
Problem:
changing settings manualy seem to work. Where problem apears is that loading 
alternate config file changes settings but on exit '.config' file is not 
writen and one is advised to run make which bombs.
Also window:	Do you wish to save your new kernel configuration ?
				<ESC><ESC> to continue
					<YES>	<NO>
does not apear.
Solution for me is before exit to change content of window (Save an Alternate 
Configuration File) to .config. And only then file .config is writen.
It seems that contents of bouth Load and save Alt Conf File are set to same 
using Load. It may actualy write to alternate file instead to .config 
One which I'm compiling at present is 2.6.23.14 version
