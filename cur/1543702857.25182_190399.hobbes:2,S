You have an anti-problem. The chipset includes an I/O-APIC
(good) and your mobo manufacturer was decent enough to include
the appropriate BIOS MP tables to describe it to the OS.
Other manufacturers skip the MP table, forcing you to enable
ACPI and pray it actually works. 
This is one area where Gigabyte seems to be consistently
better (more user-friendly) than ASUS.
