Subject: [2.4] [PATCH] update reiserfs docs url in Configure.help
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello!
   This trivial patch replaces reiserfs.org url in Configure.help
   with namesys.com, because reiserfs.org was cybersquatted recently.
   Also we do not need any NFS patches anymore.
   Please apply. Thank you.
