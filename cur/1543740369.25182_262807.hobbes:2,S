Let me add the basics that the kernel expects to execute
/sbin/init. This means that there must be a root file-system
to contain it. However, it can be a RAM-disk. That's how
initrd works. /sbin/init can be a program that you write
that does everything you need yout system to do. It can
fork off multiple tasks, etc. Just don't accidentally call
exit() or return from main()!
The kernel configuration can be changed so that it's really
small. It is possible to boot the Linux operating system plus
an entire network router from a 1.44Mb floppy disk, or anything
that can emulate such a disk (a NVRAM disk).
Shutdown and reboot are simple, for instance 'reboot' is
system-call number 88. It takes some documented parameters.
You don't really need a 'C' runtime library if you want
to make your own interface to the kernel. The kernel
directly provides the non-buffered file stuff, basically
most everything in unistd.h and more.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
