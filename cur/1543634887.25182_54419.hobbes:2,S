Hi Pavel,
Is it just the mod_dec_use_count; return/unload race we're worried about?  
I'm not clear on why this is hard.  I'd think it would be sufficient just to 
walk all runnable processes to ensure none has an execution address inside the
module.  For smp, an ipi would pick up the current process on each cpu.
At this point the use count must be zero and the module deregistered, so all 
we're interested in is that every process that dec'ed the module's use count 
has succeeded in executing its way out of the module.  If not, we try again 
later, or if we're impatient, also bump any processes still inside the module 
to the front of the run queue.
I'm sure I must have missed something.
