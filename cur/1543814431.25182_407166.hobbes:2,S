Adrian-
I've moved the CPIA2 build configuration to cpia2/Kconfig in the v4l-dvb 
mercurial tree, so I had to alter your patch slightly in order to apply it.
You can see the regenerated patch at:

Thank you!
Mauro, I have some other build configuration fixes that I haven't 
applied to the tree yet, but the following have already been applied and 
tested.  (using 'make kernel-links')  Please pull at your convenience:
http://linuxtv.org/hg/~mkrufky/v4l-dvb
-VIDEO_CPIA2 must depend on USB
-Kconfig: fix VIDEO_PVRUSB2 video decoder build configuration
-Kconfig: remove VIDEO_DECODER
-Kconfig: add menu items for saa7115 decoder and saa7127 encoder modules
