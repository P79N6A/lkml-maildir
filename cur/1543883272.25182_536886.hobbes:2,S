For Suspend2, and I think for swsusp too, we bmap the locations when
allocating the storage, and then submit our own bios. Even if swsusp
isn't using this method, I'm pretty sure the swap code does bmapping at
swapon time to avoid raciness later.

It also came because of problems. Not working perfectly isn't
necessarily a sign of a faulty reason for being added in the first
place.
I should also add, not freezing things is fine if you're happy with
getting half an image at most. If you want a full
just-as-if-I'd-never-turned-the-power-off image, you need freezing so
that you can have some pages which can be saved before others are
atomically copied, to ensure the whole image is consistent.
