That was a concern to me too. However, on IA64, all page structs are
in the vmalloc region (it isnt allocated by vmalloc but is in the
same region as vmalloc'ed pages. They are mapped with 16k pages instead of the 64MB 
pages used for memory allocated by kmalloc).
Before switching to 16K pages for the page structs, we made numerous performance
measurements. As far as we could tell, there was no performce degradation
caused by the smaller pages. It seems to me that if page structs are ok 
being mapped by 16k pages, the hash tables would be ok too.
