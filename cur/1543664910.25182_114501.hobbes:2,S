Hi,
I was looking at stack usage in drivers/media/video/v4l1-compat.c::
v4l_compat_translate_ioctl().  It's 0x924 bytes on my peecee.
It's fairly straightforward to change the stack space to
kmalloc() space, but some of these functions (ioctls) are
speed-critical, so I was wondering if the changes should still
be done, or done only in some cases and not others, or wait
until an oops is reported here....
Comments?
Thanks,
~Randy
