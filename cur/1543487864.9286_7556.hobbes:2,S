Alan,
(For those repsonding to this on the kernel-list, please CC me as I am
not subscribed.)
For the fnctl and the fix for silently failing client side POSIX locks
see the other message. 
2.2.2  NFS and kernel nfsd Wierdness
------------------------------------
I have found a problem with file locking with the new kernel NFS client
and there is a patch attached, but first I will deal with some real
WIERDNESS.
While I was doing the the fix for the first problem I noticed some real
WIERDNESS between the kernel nfsd and my Xterm NFS root client.  I was
getting tons of messages about:
Feb 28 13:40:57 iona kernel: __nfs_fhget: inode 270473 busy, i_count=2,
i_nlink=
1
Feb 28 13:40:57 iona kernel: nfs_free_dentries: found run/syslogd.pid,
d_count=0
, hashed=1
Feb 28 13:40:57 iona kernel: nfs_dentry_delete: run/syslogd.pid:
ino=270473, cou
nt=2, nlink=1  
Putting in the 2.2.2ac4 patch definitely improved matters, and going to
2.0.36 kernel on the XTerm client with nfsd on the server stopped the
problem or changing back to the old user space rpc.mountd and rpc.nfsd
on the server with a 2.2.2ac4 kernel also solved the problems.  This
means there is some interesting things going on between the new server
nfsd and client.  At one time the bug latched onto ypbind's constant
fnctl lock checking of its /var/run PID file and I got continuous log
messages... You mostly notice it on boot or shutdown or probably on any
intensive file operation. This REALLY needs a good look thru. Thoughts?
Ideas?
For those wanting to replicate this I am running Redhat  5.2 with the
patch set they posted and Linux 2.2.2ac4.  The Xterm runs with an NFS
root mounted file system and the /sbin /bin /lib /usr /home and /opt
directories NFS mounted off the server as well. 
Cheers,
Matthew Grant
