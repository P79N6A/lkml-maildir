I would think so too. Unfortunately this is what I found for make
allyesconfig on 2.6.16.9:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
21615935 7929490 2187672 31733097        1e43569 vmlinux-3.3.5-new
21616824 7929298 2187672 31733794        1e43822 vmlinux-3.3.5-old
21546713 7616546 2184984 31348243        1de5613 vmlinux-4.1.0-new
21546551 7616458 2184984 31347993        1de5519 vmlinux-4.1.0-old
Where "old" is the original one, and "new" the one with the included
patch applied. So the patch is a small win with gcc-3.3.5 and a small
loss on gcc-4.1.0. I don't really understand why 4.1.0 produces larger
code with the patch, but I triple-checked...
Groeten,
Bart
