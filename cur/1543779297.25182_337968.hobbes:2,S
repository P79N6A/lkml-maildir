Subject: [patch 1/1] UML Support - SYSEMU: slight cleanup and speedup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/31/130

As a follow-up to "UML Support - Ptrace: adds the host SYSEMU support, for UML
and general usage" (i.e. uml-support-* in current mm).
Avoid unconditionally jumping to work_pending and code copying, just reuse the
already existing resume_userspace path.
About those patches, they should stay in -mm only for now - I expect to get
them reviewed.
One interesting note, from Charles P. Wright, suggested that the API is
improvable with no downsides for UML (except that it will have to support yet
another host API, since dropping support for the current API, for UML, is not
reasonable from users' point of view).
