hi,
I compiled a new kernel image with bridge support. 
When i boot with the new kernel i get the message
....
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) read only
Freeing unused kernel memory: 52k frees
warning: unable to open an initial console
Which option i missed when getting the new kernel image?
 Thanks & Regards,
   -Ramasamy.
