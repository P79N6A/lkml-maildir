Yes, you can: it's called linear raid mode; both the raid stuff currently
in the kernel (raid 0.4?) and the newer 0.90 raid code support this mode.
For the raid code in the kernel use
mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
mdrun -pl /dev/md0
where /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 are the partitions you want to
concatenate into a logical device.
For the new raid stuff you'd use a /etc/raidtab file to describe the device:
raiddev /dev/md0
    raid-level                linear
    nr-raid-disks             3
    nr-spare-disks            0
    persistent-superblock     0
    chunk-size                4
    device                    /dev/sda1
    raid-disk                 0
    device                    /dev/sdb1
    raid-disk                 1
    device                    /dev/sdc1
    raid-disk                 2
and start the raidarray using 
raid0run /dev/md0
Both these setups work without using any raid superblocks; advantage:
should work with pre-existing data. disadvantage: neat features like
automatic startup of raid devices by the kernel and finding the partition
regardless of SCSI ID aren't available. (the new raidcode works best if it
can place a 4k datastructure, the raid superblock, at the end of each
partition being part of a raid device).
Bye, Martin
