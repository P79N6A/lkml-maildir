you see everything in black and white, ignoring all the grey scales! 
Upstream PI futexes are perfectly fine as long as the mm semaphore is 
not write-locked (by anyone) while the critical path is running. Given 
that real-time tasks often use mlockall and other practices to simplify 
their workload so this is not all that hard to achieve.

this happens automatically when you use Peter's stuff on -rt. But 
mainline should not be bothered with this.

Peter's stuff does this already if you remap all the mutex ops to 
rt_mutex ops. Which is also what happens on -rt automatically. Ok?
[ for mainline it is totally pointless and unnecessary to slow down all 
  MM ops via an rt_mutex, because there are so many other, much larger 
  effects that make execution time unbound. (interrupts for example) ]
