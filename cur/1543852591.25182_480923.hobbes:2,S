Oh, mine was only a general warn. I hadn't looked at the generic code 
before. But now that I poke on it, I see:
void kevent_requeue(struct kevent *k)
{
       unsigned long flags;
       spin_lock_irqsave(&k->st->lock, flags);
       __kevent_requeue(k, 0);
       spin_unlock_irqrestore(&k->st->lock, flags);
}
and then:
static int __kevent_requeue(struct kevent *k, u32 event)
{
       int ret, rem;
       unsigned long flags;
       ret = k->callbacks.callback(k);
Isn't the k->callbacks.callback() possibly end up calling f_op->poll?
