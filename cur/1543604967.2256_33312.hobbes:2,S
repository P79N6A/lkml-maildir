I would download a Linux kernel from kernel.org and use that. There is no
joy in use an old kernel from anyone (in most cases). I *think* Slackware
was using a stock Linux kernel, but unless you have a good reason to use
the older version I'd download the current 2.2.
You might consider updating to something a bit newer in the way of total
install, but that's up to you.
