Of course the MPOL_* modes aren't arbitrary; they are defined in an enum 
that has a well-defined and explicit behavior for how they are mapped to 
int values based on a standard.
I have more mempolicy patches that add additional behavior and cleanups so 
I can queue the following for a later posting.  I'd like to avoid 
respinning this set unless there are actual design or implementation 
concerns that are raised.
