maybe i misunderstood your point, but:
a] every alsa driver can have an option "index" which tells it what card
number to grab, so either pass it as module load option or at kernel
boot time..
b] applications should actually allow the user to enter _any_ string as
a device name (well "any" is actually too much). This enables the user
to define his own pcm devices (i.e. using alsa pcm LADSPA plugin) and
use these in any native ALSA app.
There's all kind of nifty predefined pcm device definitions available,
as i.e. "surround50", "surround51", etc.. One can even indicate what
card number to use, i.e. "surround50:0" or "surround50:2" (for the first
and third card in the system respectively). The special name "!default"
can also be overridden easily to make any sane and well programmed ALSA
app use a certain pcm device of the user's choice.
If i completely missed your point -> sorry
