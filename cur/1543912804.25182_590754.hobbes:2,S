Yess. I'm doing this, actually. Sam, Andrew and Linus have got an email
half a year ago about my intent. Tried to release 2.6.20-j4f, but that
was just a dream. Now i did some training in non-kernel related stuff and
always catch (30k, 14k) LKML backlogs to stay in tune. Some bits i 
get are here 
ftp://flower.upol.cz/Linux/info-LKML/tools/
So, ideas: UI, organization, efficiency, simplicity, etc. are welcome.
Maybe in one month i'll get something to show (base is 2.6.22).
Imagination plays very well, the thing must be ground shaking, but i'll
see how it will fit reality. Yours one in consideration from very
beginning, don't bother :)
Another problem that i have to solve before any publishing (it's
completely another tree, logic, interface), is the work tracking system,
i was describing in June. This is important, because i sick of current
chaos and manual organizing work in-tree or in regression tracking.
