I get the dropouts (2~3 sec) after dbench 32 is running for 9~10 seconds.
I've tried with RT artds and nice -20 mpg123.
Kernel: 2.4.11-pre6 + 00_vm-1 + preempt
Only solution:
I have to copy the test MPG3 file into /dev/shm.
CPU (1 GHz Athlon II) is ~75% idle during the hiccup.
The dbench processes are mostly in wait_page/wait_cache if I remember right.
So I think that you are right it is a file IO wait (latency) problem.
Please hurry up with your read/write copy-user paths lowlatency patches ;-)

Andrew have you a current version of your lowlatency patches handy?
Robert you are running a dual PIII system, right?
Could that be the ground why you aren't see the hiccup with your nice preempt 
patch? Are you running ReiserFS or EXT2/3?
Thanks,
