Dec 19 23:06:51 steel kernel: VFS: Busy inodes after unmount. Self-destruct in 5 seconds.  Have a nice day... 
no self-destruct, of course, but the first 5 seconds wasn't so wonderful :)
I had the automount 3.1.7 running.
Auto-mounted a nfs node, got in, tried unmount,
got 'busy', went out of the mounted directory,
tried to unmount master directory (and failed),
unmounted the nfs-mounted directory,
unmounted the automount master directory.
The question is just: is that bad?
