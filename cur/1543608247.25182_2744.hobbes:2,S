Just cause I didn't see anybody mentioned it yet: your statement is not
valid you switched the SI+SO values. It's 361012 for Rik-VM and 290032 for
AA-VM (easy to see as SO for Rik-VM is higher than the sum for Rik-VM in
your table ;-) ). So AA makes less swap traffic overall which does
actually explain at least partially why it wins the race.
