__get_xa_root() takes two references because it keeps one associated
with the superblock to avoid the lookup and locking later and passes one
back to the caller. When the file system is umounted, the saved
reference is freed.
The fix Andrea mentioned is unrelated. It's a fix for another patch in
- -mm. David Howells had a patch to tear down the entire dentry tree
associated with a superblock, but it depended on there being no live
references other than s_root at the time generic_shutdown_super is
called. It just moves the freeing of the dentries to ->put_super rather
than ->kill_sb.

No, I don't think it is. Looking at the code now, it seems obvious, but
I didn't notice it before and nobody else has reported a problem.
getxattr() doesn't require any VFS locking. When we get down into the
reiserfs code, it takes a read lock. If we get two concurrent threads
looking up an xattr before the root has been saved, there's a window
where REISERFS_SB(s)->xattr_root is NULL but we've already looked it up
and taken a reference on it.
I have a patch set to clean up the extended attribute code that fixes
this problem along the way by killing off the xattr locks and using the
backing files/dirs i_mutex instead. I'll post them to the reiserfs
mailing list.
