This seems like a good enough way to do it. There's no real need for
the taskstats comm length to remain exactly in sync with the task struct's
comm length (by way of trying to include sched.h etc.) though avoiding the
compile error by renaming is desirable as Balbir pointed out.
Moreover, TASK_COMM_LEN in linux/sched.h isn't likely to change much -
if it increases and csa_acct users also really need the extra info provided,
taskstats can always be changed and version bumped up. If the size decreases
there's no harm done (strncpy should be sufficient protection).
