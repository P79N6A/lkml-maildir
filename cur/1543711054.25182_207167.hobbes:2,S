Hi,
this is not to complain but rather to report and try to sort out a problem
experienced with the 2.6.x kernel for quite a long time. I am not a kernel
expert so please forgive any not helpful statements here. Also, the hardware
used is a Thinkpad T30 (2366-96U) laptop and all might just be specific to
that system.
Since this system only has USB1 available internally I purchased a PCMCIA
USB2 hub (ATEN USB 2.0 2 Port Host Control Card: PU-212). Inserting this
card into a running kernel about every other time locks up the system. The
lockup is more likely if the card is inserted longer after system start.
Here's a transcript (by hand) of the oops:
  *pde=    00000000
  Oops:    0002 [#1]
  CPU:     0
  EIP:     0060: [<f8a079e9>] Not tainted
  EFLAGS:  00010296
  EIP is at end_unlink_async+0x1a/0xf6 [ehci_hcd]
  Process usb.agent
  Call trace:    ehci_work
                 ehci_irq
                 usb_hcd_irq
                 handle_IRQ_event
                 do_IRQ
                 common_interrupt
  kernel panic: fatal exception in interrupt
  In interrupt handler - not syncing
I can certainly provide more information but the problems described above
are rather independent of the actual details of building the kernel and
rather stable. Please cc since I am not subscribed to the list.
thanks,
