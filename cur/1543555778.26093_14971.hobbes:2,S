I have learnt that it is not portable to mmap the IO memory, since some 
architectures (for example Alpha) cannot access IO memory the same was as 
physical RAM. That is why I am using memcpy_to/fromio instead of 
copy_to/from_user. If I am correctly informed, when mmaping is used, the card 
use to have some sort of DMA mechanism, so the mmaping is done on ordinary 
RAM, not IO memory. Unfortunately, on this sound card (RME Audio Digi96), I 
have to access the on-board buffers directly, using the CPU. Thus, to be 
portable, I cannot use mmap directly on the ioremap'd memory, right?
