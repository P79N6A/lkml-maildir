That's not what POLLOUT means in the Unix meaning. POLLOUT indicates the 
ability to write, and it is not meant as to signal every time a packet 
(skb) is sent on the wire (and the buffer released).
In your particular application, you could simply split the sendfile into 
appropriately sized chunks, and handle the buffer realease in there.
