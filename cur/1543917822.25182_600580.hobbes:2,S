That is correct. Smack task labels do not change spontaniously.

Good idea.

Also a good idea.

There is work required to audit, SELinux, and LSM that will be
required before Smack or any other module can really use audit
properly. Smack using audit would be nice, but there are already
interesting cases that don't require it. I have fixing up audit
on my todo list, and have made some proposals. It will require
a group effort between audit, SELinux, Smack, and LSM.

I would be delighted to have a bit of my very own. The granularity
advocates might suggest I use more than one.
Thank you for the comments.
