I'd call the ext4 case a mistake we shouldn't repeat.
It's available in the kernel since 2006.
I've seen people using ext4 on their computers running with a corrupted 
filesystem since fsck was at that point not yet capable of fixing 
whatever was corrupted.
At least one distribution already has ext4 enabled in their kernels.
