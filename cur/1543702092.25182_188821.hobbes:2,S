Ugh, stupid mistake. Just wrote the code to fast... :(
Anyway, thanks for your clarification. People like me that code a lot of 
user-space stuff, take a while to realize all the implications of SMP, ordering, 
preemption, etc., etc.
By the way, after double checking your logic, it looks good as long as there are 
no interrupts that take more than 3 jiffies to complete :)
