Definitely a good idea !
The code is much easier to read.
For those interested in trying this with 2.4, here is an adaptation of 
the patch for 2.4.19-pre10-ac2 . I did not include neither the changes 
made in 2.5.23 (at least they should not be here), nor the intel 460 
stuff (not present in 2.4).
You can find the patch at :
http://ltswww.epfl.ch/~aspert/patches/agpgart-split-2.4.19-pre10-ac2.diff.bz2
For those using kbuild, a replacement for the Makefile.in in 
'drivers/char/agp' can be found at :
http://ltswww.epfl.ch/~aspert/patches/Makefile.in
Please test (it compiles OK but I don't have a test box at hand)
