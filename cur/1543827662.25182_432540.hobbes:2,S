That was the simplest way in some cases when kmemleak was not
dependent on DEBUG_SLAB obj_size() in mm/slab.c was not always
defined. It works correctly with inlining now so I'll change them.

This cannot be an inline function as it takes a type as argument.

True, it is unnecessary. That's just my style of marking them as initialised.

That's needed because there is an exit path which doesn't set this variable.
I am OK with the other comments. Thanks.
