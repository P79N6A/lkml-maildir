Thanks Stephen.
More comments below.  This finally proves that I need to provide some
documentation for each hook under stacker showing how modules are
expected to interact.  This hopefully will help me catch things like
this.  Hopefully it would also be useful to module writers in general.

I can imagine a few ways of fixing this:
	1.	We simply expect that only one module use xattrs.  This
	is probably unacceptable, as we will want both EVM and selinux
	to store xattrs.
	2.	A module registers an xattr name when it registers
	itself.  Then only the registered module is consulted on one of
	these calls.  If no module is registered, all are consulted as
	they are now.
		This prevents a module like capability from deciding
	based on its own credentials whether another module's hook
	should be called.  Is that a good or bad thing?
		This might have the added bonus of obviating the need
	for a separate cap_stack module.
	3.	We return an error <0 only if all modules return <0.
	Otherwise we do the obvious thing:  setxattr, return 0.
	getxattr: do we return the first nonzero and stop there, or
	do we return a concatenation of the results?  I assume the
	former...
