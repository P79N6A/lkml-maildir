Hello!
> Excellent. So we can shoot eql.c for 2.4 ? (please...) 
eql has real applications not covered by teql: f.e. balancing between tunnels.
teql requires flow controlled interfaces and balances real link
capacities, rather than simply sends with apriory rates.
With all the drawbacks of apriory eql scheme for physical interfaces,
it is still useful for software interfaces and interfaces with
huge internal queues. Well, and eql is not very trivial,
it would be sad to lose this code.
John Carol Langford <jcl@gs176.sp.cs.cmu.edu> did new eql,
based on teql skeleton with different hard_start_xmit() more than year ago,
but unfortunately, he disappeared from horizont. Seems, the last version
was pretty clean, I could try to search him to query status.
> and get rid of all the crufty master/slave stuff it has 
Well, it was hidden completely inside eql.c. I deleted
some strange fields from struct net_device ("pkt_queue" and "slave")
in softnet patch, but it is because current kernel does not reference
them really.
