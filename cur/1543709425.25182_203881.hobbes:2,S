	Hi Dave & Jeff,
	The attached .bz2 file is a patch for 2.6.3 adding the
Intersil Prism54 wireless driver. Sorry for the attachement, the file
is rather big, if you want inline+plaintext, I'll send that personal
to you.
	I've been using this driver with great success on 2.6.3 and
2.6.4-rc1 (SMP). This driver support various popular CardBus and PCI
802.11g cards (54 Mb/s) based on the Intersil PrismGT/PrismDuette
chipset.
	I would like this driver to go into 2.6.X. However, I
understand that it's lot's of code to review.
	Have fun...
	Jean
