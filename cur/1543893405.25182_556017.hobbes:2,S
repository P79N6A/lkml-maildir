Quite a lot of thought, very little in the way of decisions.
The idea with going with just these two patches for now is that the uid
0 in the child namespace can be contained using selinux anyway.  The
program which does the clone(CLONE_NEWUSER) is of type newuserns_exec_t,
causing a domain transition to newuserns_user_t, which is denied rights
to all but the files in the filesystem into which it has been chrooted,
let's say newuserns_chroot_t, and to all process not of type
newuserns_user_t.

Here's what I'd like to see happen eventually:
Some user, let's say apache, or it could be root, spawns a new user
namespace.  The current process retains the original user's rights in
the original namespace, and becomes uid 0 in the new namespace, with
full capabilities to the new namespace.  It can then set up the new user
namespace as it likes.
That is where we would be heading with the roadmap I laid out in my
intro msg to the longer userns patchset.
Unfortunately that's a long way and a lot of intrusive code away from
reality atm.

Hmm, I generally go under the impression that user namespaces would be
primarily useful for vservers, not checkpoint/restart jobs, and so any
vserver would have completely different set of users from the host
system.

It would prevent the new root user from administrating users in the
virtual server, I guess.
Again the intent is that the 'new root user' would be root in the new
user namespace, but only have the capabilities of the user who did the
user namespace unshare in the original user namespace.  So once that is
possible, we would definately want to start with a root user.
