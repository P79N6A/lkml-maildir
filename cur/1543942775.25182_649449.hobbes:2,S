Ah, ok.  This one is a C2D, correct?  The only reason I asked is that 
someone was reporting an s2ram problem on P4s on some of that 
root-domain logic I submitted a little while ago (and was merged in 
.25), whereas C2D seemed fine.  That doesn't mean anything here, 
really.  The problem could still be my code, or it might be unrelated.  
I was just wondering if you also had a P4 on the troubled systems.
So is your problem on suspend or resume?  (or both?)  (I know you 
mentioned it was random problems, but I wasn't sure if you could qualify 
that further)
Any info you can provide will be appreciated.
