In other words: you cannot provide details or even prove the asserted
bug, and you are trying to shift the blame on Debian. If they no longer
have the reports, chances are the bugs have been fixed since through
Debian patches, that's their workflow.
And if you want Debian bugs, look here:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?which=pkg&data=cdrecord&archive=no&version=&dist=unstable&pend-exc=fixed&pend-exc=done&sev-exc=wishlist&sev-exc=fixed
But keep in mind only the "forwarded" or "upstream" bugs are your
business.
Besides that, I wouldn't exactly call it quality standard if you lose
important bug reports about the environment.
