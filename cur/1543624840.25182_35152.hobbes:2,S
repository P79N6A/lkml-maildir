Subject: [PATCH] 2.4 and 2.5: fix /proc/kcore
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

As mentioned on May 11 on LKML, here is a patch to fix /proc/kcore for
architectures which do not have RAM located at physical address 0.
I did say I'd send this on Monday, however I only got feedback from the
ia64 people, and /proc/kcore is already broken on their machines anyway.
(They need to fix it up; they place modules below PAGE_OFFSET, which
breaks our generated ELF core header).
So I've decided to send it a few days early.
Please apply.
