That's a pretty good idea then :)

By this, I assume you are implying that infrastructure for mounting on a 
given struct file (w/ S_ISDIR) would be made.  Correct?
How would this kind of trap be installed in userspace?  'mount -t trap 
-o fd=# none /trappoint' which gets caught by the vfs layer in a special 
manner I suppose?  The vfs system would of course be responsible for 
pipe errors/closure.  As well, the passed opened mountpoint-to-be would 
have to be owned by the process owning the reading end of the pipe.

Alright.  Automounting aside, does it still make sense to have *some* 
way for a sys-admin to join an existing namespace?  sys_pushns(pid_t 
pid)/sys_popns() perhaps?  Administrating an environment with multiple 
running namespaces may become difficult to administer without such 
capability.

What is not sane about mount(2)?  Are you talking about the 
move/bind/remount functionality?
