09:12:44 up 1 day, 43 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.48, 0.44, 0.42
It really fixes this issue. :-)
Thanks to you all!

Hmm.
That sounds bad.
I think, if highmem is unreachable some times that makes lowmem more
valuable!
The kernel needs to keep (reserve) it free as much as possible.
The buffer-cache is an unimportant thing next to keeping lowmem free, but it
is blocks the performance and wastes the systems resources!
It is possible any workaround?
The NBD is finally fixed, and production ready.
The big systems should use it, because it is easy.
Additionally the big system usually needs the maximum of performance.....
(+ the good cache/buffer extends the hardware lifetime.)
I think it is important to be changed.
(e.g. i use 4 nodes, 4x 3.3TB to use it as one big blockdev.)
Cheers,
Janos
