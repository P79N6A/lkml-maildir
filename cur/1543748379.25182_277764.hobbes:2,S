Increasing TCP buffers in 2.6.6 works somehow because it eliminates high RTT
over the large distance.
Here is exaclty what I do:
/sbin/sysctl -w net/core/rmem_max=8388608
/sbin/sysctl -w net/core/wmem_max=8388608
/sbin/sysctl -w net/core/rmem_default=1048576
/sbin/sysctl -w net/core/wmem_default=1048576
/sbin/sysctl -w net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling=1
/sbin/sysctl -w net/ipv4/tcp_rmem="4096 1048576 8388608"
/sbin/sysctl -w net/ipv4/tcp_wmem="4096 1048576 8388608"
echo 32768 > /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 txqueuelen 1000
