That _really_ doesn't work.
Old machines don't go away. We can't just say "wait a year and turn on 
MMCONFIG", because all the broken machines WILL STILL EXIST.

Just make it so. The name is fine, the concept is unavoidable. The people 
who complain are whiners that haven't ever had to deal with the fact that 
there are broken machines around. 
For example, right now Jeff never sees the problem, because when MMCONFIG 
doesn't work, it's never his problem - nothing in the machine works. But 
if he has to add a "pci_enable_mmconfig()" to the drivers he maintains, he 
sees it as a _new_ problem, so he obviously thinks it's stupid: he was 
never impacted by the issues it fixed!
So it's natural for Jeff to not like it, but that doesn't make Jeff right 
in this case. It just means that Jeff never had to worry about it before, 
because as long as MMCONFIG wasn't per-driver, the problems it caused were 
never *his* problems. But that doesn't make them less of a problem.
