Yes, -fomit-frame-point make the deal.
In average, threadlet runs as fast as epoll. 
Just because there are _no_ rescheduling in that case.
I added a printk into __async_schedule() and started
ab -c7000 -n20000 
http://192.168.4.80/
 
against slow via epia, and got only one of them.
Client is latest
../async-test-v4/evserver_epoll_threadlet
Btw, I need to admit, that I have totally broken kevent tree there - it
does not work on that machine on higher loads, so I'm investigating that
problem now.
