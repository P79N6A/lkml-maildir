Why? What's so special about the name 'ttyS'?

I don't see why that 'should' be the case. Certainly it _isn't_ the case
on most supported platforms -- we have separate device numbers, and
names, for most types of ports. There's only one or two drivers which
abuse ttySn for anything other than 8250 ports.
