    Then -==YOU==- are completely mistaken about why -==I==- contributed
    to Linux (the kernel & the system). 
By now, many people have contributed for many reasons, to Linux and to
the GNU/Linux system.  I do not claim to speak for you; I am talking
about why the system exists in the first place.  It is not a haphazard
collection of components.  In the GNU Project, we systematically wrote
one component after another.  Our goal was a completely free system,
and we took step after step to reach it.
Thank you for contributing, whatever your motives were.
    There is a reason why I am not named Mark Mielke-Newman, and our newborn
    son is not named Ethan Mielke-Herighty-Newman-Marr.
It isn't a good analogy.  Your son wasn't developed by starting with
you and adding some pieces.
