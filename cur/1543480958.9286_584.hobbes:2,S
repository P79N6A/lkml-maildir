I had a successfull boot of 2.2.0-pre8 last night.  Fron what I could
tell, there were no compile warnings and no errors.  I had left it running
overnight, and was still running when I got up in the morning.  There
haven't been any problems with sound, ethernet, or SCSI, and pre8 feels
faster than pre6 (didn't try pre7).
My computer is a follows:
  166 MHz Pentium
  64 MB RAM
  2 EIDE HDs
  1 HD and 1 CD-ROM on a 53c875 controller
  NE2000 PCI clone
  SB Vibra16 sound
  Debian 2.0
I can provide more information in case anyone wants it.
