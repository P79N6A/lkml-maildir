SLES7 or SLES11 is not any different than SLES9 in that respect.
Suppose I send you some random vmlinux binary. How do you (you as in linus.sh)
know what 'uname -r' is inside this binary?
There are surely many many ways to pass that info. Having a string like
'Linux version 2.6.19-g9202f325-dirty' somewhere in the binary is the
most reliable one. Dont you agree?
Just think about it for a minute.
