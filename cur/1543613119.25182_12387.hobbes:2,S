But does NTFS specificism/cripplism belong in VFS?  (I in no way blame 
you for NTFS's design:-) )

I am not saying that the features of EAs are not useful, I am saying 
that I want to choose them
individually for particular files.
It could be so much better to have EDIBLE_PIZZA (example from previous 
email)
instead of just PIZZA, sigh.

Fortunately he isn't entirely consistent on this point.:-)
I predict you guys will ship first and get a lot of usage, and then we 
will ship later with more features,
and the result will be a mess for users.  This is the usual evolutionary 
design standards mess.  
Objectively, I understand it is highly reasonable for the Linux 
community to assume that what we
implement will be horrible until we finish it.  I would encourage it to 
assume that someone else
will eventually get orthogonalism right though, and I think it would be 
worth waiting for it, because
these are the sorts of design features that stick around for 30 years. 
 I don't really expect that most
folks will choose to wait though.
Best to all,
Hans
