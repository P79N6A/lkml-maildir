I had a similar problem. I did a make mrproper, make xconfig and a
make dep clean bzlilo modules modules_install . That took care of it.
What is really weird is that I was in /usr/src when I found the include
directory. The one that belongs under /usr/src/linux. At that point I
untar'd the 2.2.1 distrib and did the above. I can now compile the
kernel with no problems. Don't know how I managed to get include put
in /usr/src but that was the source of my kernel problems (along with
my lirc problems).
