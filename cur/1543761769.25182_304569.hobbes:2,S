Yeah -- I agree. I also don't like that double-meaning. That was the
reason why I originally proposed the use of a new parameter...

I think that would also be a good solution.

IMHO it does not make sense to call psmouse_initialize() although it
does not disturb lifebook-mode. But setting resolution is already done
during lifebook_initialize(). And there psmouse->set_resolution() and
psmouse->set_rate() are used so setting resolution and rate should also
work via sysfs.
My stomach feels strange when I call lifebook_initialize() and after
that call an xy_initialize() for some other protocol although it might
not disturb the lifebook-mode.
