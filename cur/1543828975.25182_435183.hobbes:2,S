Normal failure.  This indicates that the media has been changed since the
last I/O operation.

I don't know why this failed.  Maybe the disc didn't have a valid Table of 
Contents.

These failed for the same reason as the earlier READ_TOC.

No.  If the cable was a problem then all the commands (not just READ_TOC)  
would have gotten errors (not failures).

This was a different sort of error.  The code was "Logical unit not ready, 
long write in progress", which makes sense.

It sure does look like the ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL is the cause of the 
problem.

Yep.  The ALLOW_MEDIUM_REMOVAL occurs as part of handling the close().  
And you can understand a CD drive not wanting to carry out a long write 
when the door is unlocked.
The real problem seems to be that the device is reachable in two different 
ways, and they don't implement proper mutual exclusion.  HAL (or your test 
program) is undoubtedly using /dev/sr0 or something similar, whereas 
cdrecord uses /dev/sg0.  Going through two different drivers, it's no 
surprise they wind up interfering with each other.

Unfortunately I can't debug this without seeing the start of the oops 
message.
