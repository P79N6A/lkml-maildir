I just got it working last night with my home computer, which has
ATI-Radeon 7500 PCI version.
However, now I am  at work, so I will post for you tonight when I get
home.
Couple things I have done.
1) Modify kernel (/usr/src/linux/driver/char/drm/radeon_cp.c
2) Download xfree 4.2.1 and modify couple files in it, and
recompile.
I will post the diff file tonite.
Progress: This morning I tested, I can run 3D Crack-Attack, and tuxracer.
I will test more, and let you know.
