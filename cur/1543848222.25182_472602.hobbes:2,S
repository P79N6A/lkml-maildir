So you are saying that dmraid should build 3 tables: 1 for the bulk of 
the array, 1 for only the last stripe, and 1 linear to connect them?
I'm not sure where the ambiguity is.  Obviously all the stripes prior to 
the last should behave normally, the only problem comes from the last 
stripe.  How else could you map the last stripe other than laying down x 
sectors onto y drives as x / y sectors on each drive in sequence?
