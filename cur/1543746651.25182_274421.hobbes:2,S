Not to stir up the flames any further (and this is really a moot point
since I got rid of our use of RCU)...
But given that I could implement the same API as in rcupdate.h as
below without using IBM's patented technique, how does merely using
this API cause code to require a patent license?
Thanks,
 Roland
