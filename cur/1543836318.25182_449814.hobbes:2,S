Subject: [PATCH] Add stable branch to maintainers file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/3/174

While helping someone to submit a patch to the stable branch, I noticed
that the stable branch is not listed in the MAINTAINERS file.  This was
after I went there to look for the email addresses for the stable branch
list (stable@kernel.org).
This patch adds the stable branch to the maintainers file so that people
can find where to send patches when they have a fix for the stable team.
