I came up with an idea. The MTRRs are per-cpu things.
Ingo Molnar's IRQ affinity code helps binding certain
IRQ sources to certain CPUs.
What if the MTRR driver allows per-CPU settings, maybe only on
uncached areas? Of course the real memory should be cached in
every CPU to avoid slowdowns. So that if you set that eth0's
IRQ will be handled by CPU1, the MTRRs of CPU1 will be set
accordingly, and the other CPUs will not care about eth0,
so they do not need eth0's MTRR settings.
Tell me if this is a highly stupid idea. :-)

Zoltan Boszormenyi
