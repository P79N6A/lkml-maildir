	When I searched ACPI on LKML, I was swamped with results. The

	By the way, I've got nearly the same laptop, maybe I'll check
for BIOS updates.

	I use serial console, which make it trivial. Yeah, all my
laptops still have a serial port.
	On the other hand, you narrowed the GIT commit which caused
