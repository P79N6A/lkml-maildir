That's because of Linux port of ACPI CA structure.
ACPI CA divides the acpi driver into OS independent part and os dependent
part.  acpi_ex_pci_config_space_handler exists in OS-independent
part and acpi_os_read_pci_configuration exists in OS-dependent
part.  The OS independent part is shared with other OSes, while
OS dependent part (acpi_os_xxx functions) are Linux specific.
That's the way ACPI driver designers took and Linux can benefit
from other OS's feedback in OS-independent part.

It would be great if we had the same 2.5 functions in 2.4.
