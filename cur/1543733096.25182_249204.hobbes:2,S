Hi,
Just very tired of not getting buggy nbd (original in the kernel) to work and
luckily found your enbd package when googling. Compile, did some simple
command and it works! Many thanks.
I am using swap over enbd and seemx not having any trouble so far , need more
time to stress the system but too exited to say thank you :-)
Ah, is there support (module) for kernel 2.6? I have not tried to compile enbd using
kernel source 2.6 but as in your homepage, not any mention to 2.6 so ..
Again many thanks. Strange why your patch doesn't go to the mainline kernel?
Best regards,
Steve Kieu
