The kernel (2.2.15--2.2.17, 2.4.x--2.4.8) had code to reinitialize a plain
PS2 mouse upon a reconnect event. 
It caused too many problems on mouses that are not plain PS/2, but eg.
synps2 (Synaptics touchpad). Those are not happy being reinitialized ...
The code has been disabled in 2.2.18/2.4.9 therefore. Use psaux-reconnect
boot param to get the code back.
But normally your mouse driver (gpm or X11) has to do the reinitialization
anyways, because it knows about the specific reinitialization sequence a
mouse needs. 
The kernel can't handle it, unless you put the whole collection of drivers
there.
