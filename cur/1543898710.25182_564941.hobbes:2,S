  First, thanks a lot to all those involved in this.
  Just a few things at the top of the main page:
    - the http, ftp and rsync links still point at kernel.org, as
      the content is also at eu.kernel.org maybe change these.
    - idem for the 'prepatch', 'snapshot' and '-mm patch' links
    - idem for the 'current changesets' 'C' links
  One last thing, is there a git server as well for eu?
  Thanks again,
  Sébastien.
