But disk bandwidth is so incredibly expensive that compression becoming
more and more useful: on compressed file system bandwidth of user-data
transfers can be larger than raw disk bandwidth. It is the same
situation as with allocation of disk space for files: disks are cheap,
but storing several files in the same block becomes more advantageous
over time.
