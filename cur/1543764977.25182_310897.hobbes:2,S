I've been reading this and have another thought for you guys to keep in 
mind for this tool.
version control of system config files on linux systems.
it sounds like you could put the / fileystem under the control of git 
(after teaching it to not cross fileystem boundries so you can have 
another filesystem to work with) and version control your entire system. 
if this was done it would be nice to add a item type that would referance 
a file in a distro package to save space. it sounds like you could run a 
git checkin daily (as part of the updatedb run for example) at very little 
cost.
for that matter by comparing the git data between servers (or between a 
server and an archive) you could easily use it to detect tampering.
sounds very interesting, but I'm going to let things settle down a bit 
before I try to tackle this (but you guys who ar working on it shoudl feel 
free to add the couple options nessasary to implement this if you want ;-)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
