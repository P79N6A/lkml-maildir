Hi all,
I'm having a bit of a hard time trying to figure out a few things  
using GIT. Mainly, I'd like to run a non-GIT 2.6.14 kernel, but with  
Jeff Garzik's latest libata patches from his GIT repo. I've tried  
quite a few things to generate a patch from Jeff's repo that will  
apply to 2.6.14, but nothing I do generates a working patch. Can  
someone give me some guidance?
I've tried various iterations of the following:
git diff master..ALL
git diff master..v2.6.14
git diff v2.6.14..master
and various other such iterations. As you can probably tell I don't  
know much about git, but all the tutorials haven't helped get me a  
working patch!
Cheers,
Chris
