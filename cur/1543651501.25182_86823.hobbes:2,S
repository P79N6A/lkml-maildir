Geoff,
thanks for the reply.  I have a feeling that LTP would be overjoyed
to have you contribute to the LTP and make it a more accurate Posix
compliance test.  The areas that Linux does not currently cover --
message queues, semaphores, etc -- *should* be in the LTP, regardless
of whether Linux currently implements them.  Linux's 'expected results'
on these tests would be 'fail' at the moment.  That's not a problem.
The LTP would also greatly benefit from better tracability and coverage.
I urge you to consider ways in which you could work within the
framework of the LTP to meet both your goals and the LTP's goals.
They may be more in synch than you originally thought!
