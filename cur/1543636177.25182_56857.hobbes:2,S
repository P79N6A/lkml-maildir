I've read the errata but thats not given me any clues. The box is fast,
including PCI bandwidth measurements but neither PCI card or SCSI
streaming to tape or CD-R works well. The motherboard IDE works a treat
and the 64bit slots give me excellent performance (but thats a raid card
so I can't yet use it for tape)
