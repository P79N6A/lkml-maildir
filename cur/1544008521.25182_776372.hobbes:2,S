Okay, this makes no sense whatsoever.  Could you send me the following:
a. the .config you're using;
b. what kernel headers do you have in /usr/include
   (if you installed the old ones with the broken header guards
   with "make headers_install", then your development environment
   is broken);
c. "make arch/x86/kernel/syscall_64.i".
