Subject: [BK PATCH] i386 timer changes for 2.5.41
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus,
I've taken the i386 timer.c patches that John Stultz has been working on
for a while, made some minor tweaks, added them to a bk tree, and tested
them on all the boxes that I have access too.  Here's the resulting
changesets:
Please pull from bk://lsm.bkbits.net/timer-2.5
These split up the time.c code to handle different interrupt time
sources, moving the code into a new arck/i386/kernel/timers directory.
This is going to get more important as new timer sources become
available (like IBM's Summit chipset), and removes a lot of #ifdefs from
the existing code.
The differences from John's last patches are:
	- use bk to show the history of the time.c file moves
	- added proper documentation for struct timer_opts
	- init() in timer_opts now returns 0 for success
	- timer array is now static, and NULL terminated to make
	  adding new sources an easier patch.
thanks,
greg k-h
