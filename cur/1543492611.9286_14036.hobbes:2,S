It would not behave like it is supposed to. This would just break
compatibility, and this is not necessarily bad - not every enhancement needs
to be backward compatible and run with an old kernel, what a deadend idea.
Lots of code does not work (as expected) when run with an older kernel. OTOH,
old code should run as close as possible to the expected behaviour with a
newer kernel.
Keeping compatibility is not always a good thing.

Compatibility with tar would indeed need to be fixed, if you want it to store
the additional flags. I see no way around this. Exporting binaries via NFS
servers is problematic anyway and generally only useful between the same OS.
In short, I consider capabilities and a much finer grained access control a
good thing. If we break compatibility to old code, so be it.
