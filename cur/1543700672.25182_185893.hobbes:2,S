Is it only the block dirtyings that you're missing, or is there more? I 
might have used an old 2.4 patch as reference -- what was the latest 
version again?

OK, that depends on your point of view. At this point it weren't the 
WRITEs that were interesting to me, it were the READs. The WRITEs just 
came as a bonus. The reason: what bugged me during development were the 
programs that read new data from disk, and I wanted to find out what to 
turn off in order to keep the disk from spinning up all the time. And 
when the disk DID spin up, I wanted to know if it was my fault or if it 
was some daemon messing up my tests again. This is due to my not 
actually working on a laptop but on a home server machine. :) I guess 
that when you're going for disk-spindowns of longer than 10 minutes 
(which is what the block dirtying dumps are for, presumably?) dirtyings 
start to become interesting. I'll see if I can port that bit as well, 
shouldn't be that much work.
