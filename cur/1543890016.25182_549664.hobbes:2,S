True, on sparc64 PCI-E controllers, for example, the MSI vector is
received by the PCI-E host controller, and the host controller turns
this into a cpu format interrupt packet for the system bus.
I guess on IRQ pin starved systems, the PCI-E host controller or
something similar would get interrogated by the cpu for the MSI vector
number.
I don't want to be the person who has to code up support for
that, as it's not easy to shim mid-level vectoring into the
generic IRQ layer currently.  I'd love to be able to do that
on sparc64 instead of what arch/sparc64/kernel/pci_sun4v.c's
pci_sun4v_msi_prehandler() is doing.
There is a lot of information and vectoring capabilities present
that I'm simply not taking advantage of yet :-)
