What is the status of the new driver model? Are the driver being ported
over in a timely fashion? Is this process going to be complete before the
code freeze/2.6? I've heard the PCI bus and drivers are not yet converted
to strut devices? Oh, is the old LDM or what ever is was being riped out
or left for compatibility?
Thanks, --Lou
