FWIW I've had the same symptoms with a stock 2.2.3 kernel. Also running
cc1, during an egcs snapshot test run. I thought it was merely owing to
running out of memory (egcs has been known to bloat to ridiculous size
during the test runs, in the past. I do not know whether or not it
actually did so in this case).
If it recurs in 2.2.4 I'll provide more information.
At any rate, this is a confirmation that it is fairly unlikely to be
hardware problems causing this.
