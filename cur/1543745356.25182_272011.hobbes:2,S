I know I am late reporting this but I didn't figure it out until late
this afternoon. I had trouble booting this one on my SMP workstation at
the office. It would hang after it had almost finished booting. Anyway
the solution was to disable tracing in /etc/rc.local and then re-enable
it after it has finished booting. I know this happens late in the boot
but it works for me.

To be honest I am not sure which of the above fixes the late boot hang 
and I didn't have time to figure it out either. This doesn't happen on 
my SMP system here.
