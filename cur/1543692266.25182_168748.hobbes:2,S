Here's a thought ...
#define min_not_zero(l, r) \
	min((unsigned long)(l - 1), (unsigned long)(r - 1)) + 1
Seems to me that'll always give the right answer ... 0 if both 0,
otherwise the lower of the two.  And it's kind of an awkward name.
How about making it *really* specific to request_queue, putting it in
blkdev.h and calling it request_sector_min() like so:
#define request_sector_min(a, b) \
	min((a)->max_sectors - 1, (b)->max_sectors - 1) + 1
(no cast needed cos they're already unsigned.  um, unless I've misremembered
how C constants work again... should they be 1U?)
