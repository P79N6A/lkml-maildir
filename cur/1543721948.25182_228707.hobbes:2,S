Yes, same here! I had to decrease the speed of the keyboard in KDE config, 
because I couldn't type a character without that the character was printed 
hundred times.
The jumping icon on startup of several KDE apps, is now jumping much faster 
too and apps are started much faster!
I'm working on a Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU.
