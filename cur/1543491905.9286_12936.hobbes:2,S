Dear folks,
I'm often in the situation of compiling a new kernel, and I want to use
the settings from before, but also to be aware of new options.  What I
would like to do is to be able to run make xconfig on an updated config
file; I don't want to go through and make all the same changes by hand,
but I also don't want to lose the new options.  I want to be able to
interactively edit the new configuration.
Do I use make oldconfig for this?  How?
