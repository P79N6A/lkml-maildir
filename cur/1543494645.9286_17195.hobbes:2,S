I have seen it several times in all three different pcs that I have been
using. The CPU time is always about the same. One example:
(Wed Apr  7 19:59:48 EET DST 1999)
root         3  0.0  0.0     0     0  ?  SW<  19:28 71224874:22 (kswapd)
Then I rebooted and after a while another one:
(Wed Apr  7 22:58:00 EET DST 1999)
root         2  3.6  0.0     0     0  ?  SW   20:15 71224880:16 (kflushd)
I think it is connected with heavy disk IO and/or networking but that's just
a hunch.
When I first saw it, the kernel version was at 2.0.28 and it still happens
with the 2.0.37pre kernels. But I don't know how to trigger it.
