  Why did they send you those plots? What was their point?

  Yep, that's the idealized 3.3V signaling case. However, it looks like
the signal is overshooting a bit (-0.8V below 0 and +0.8V over 3.3V from looking
at the 1st plot) which may be due to incorrect impedance matching on the bus,
probes artifacts, ...

  This one looks a bit high (if they measured the same voltages I wonder
where they got their scopes calibrated ;-) )

  Why not!

  Well it depends on which of the plot is lying. Looking at the PCI spec
(4.2.2.1) the Vih max for a device is Vcc-max+0.5 = 3.6 + 0.5 = 4.1V
the Vil min is -0.5V so in this case it looks a bit high. But I would not
worry too much, those are only the overshoots, and the circuits have
clamping diodes on their inputs.
  The test waveform voltages for the maximum ratings (4.2.2.3) against which
every PCI device should be qualified are higher than what you have here: 7.1V
peak-to-peak.
  Hope this helps.
  Sebastien.
