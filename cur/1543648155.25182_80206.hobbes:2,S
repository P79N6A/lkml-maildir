Something like:
	static const struct pnp_id pnp_dev_table[] = {
	/* standard printer port */
	{ .name = "PNP0400", .data = 0},
or whatever those fields are called.

Removing #ifdefs is also nice :)

To fully support this, you need to modify modutils to generate the
proper modules.pnpmap file from the .o files.  Take a look at the source
for it for how to do this.
Also, some kind of /sbin/hotplug notification when a pnp device is found
is a good idea.  Hm, looks like you already get that for free right now
with the existing driver code, nevermind :)
thanks,
