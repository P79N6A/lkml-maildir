vendor-sec probably covers the majority of users
It covers
	2.4
	2.6-ac
	Red Hat
	SuSE
	Debian
	Gentoo
	Mandrake
	and many more including some of the BSD folk (a lot of user space bugs
are common)
2.6 base isn't covered because Linus has differing views.

I'd say you are very very wrong from the data I have access too,
probably of the order of 1000:1 wrong or more.

They chose to. A lot of people report bugs directly to Linus too or to
the lists or to full-disclosure depending upon their view. The folks who
report bugs in private either to Linus or to vendor-sec or maintainers
or whoever generally believe that the bad guys can move faster and cause
a lot of damage if a bug isn't fixed before announce.
Thats based on the observation that
	- the bad guys have to move a small exploit versus a large binary
	- the exploit doesn't have to pass quality assurance, you just write
more
	- they can automate the attack tools very effectively 
So the non-disclosure argument is perhaps put as "equality of access at
the point of discovery means everyone gets rooted.". And if you want a
lot more detail on this read papers on the models of security economics
- its a well studied field.
