I've used tried the -mm-kernels since they've actually made
2.5-kernels usable on my laptop lately (Compaq Evo800c), but
2.5.64-mm2 and onwards doesnt work with X anymore. I run 4.3.0-r1 from
the Gentoo unstable "branch".
with -mm1 I X coming up just nicely, and now the screen just goes
black after trying to start X, and it seems related to DRM. With
-mm[56] the last bit I see in my X startup is this:
(==) RADEON(0): Write-combining range (0x88000000,0x4000000)
drmOpenDevice: minor is 0
drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev/dri/card0
[HANG]
With -mm1 and 2.4.21preX it shows this:
drmOpenDevice: minor is 0
drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev/dri/card0
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: Open failed
drmOpenDevice: minor is 0
drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev/dri/card0
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: open result is -1, (No such device)
drmOpenDevice: Open failed
drmOpenDevice: minor is 0
drmOpenDevice: node name is /dev/dri/card0
drmOpenDevice: open result is 6, (OK)
drmGetBusid returned ''
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] loaded kernel module for "radeon" driver
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] created "radeon" driver at busid "PCI:1:0:0"
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] added 8192 byte SAREA at 0xf098d000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] mapped SAREA 0xf098d000 to 0x40013000

Although it hangs under -mm[56] the machine will still respond to
CRTL-ALT-DEL and reboot nicely. The only modification to the kernel
I've done it backing out smalldevfs (Gentoo likes to have the full
thing). I've also tried having the DRM-stuff as modules and as
compiled in, no difference

Other than that 2.5.64-mm6 is very usable, but only in text mode.
