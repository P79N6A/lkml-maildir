From Grub's menu.lst:
title		Debian GNU/Linux, kernel 2.6.6
root		(hd0,0)
kernel	/vmlinuz-2.6.6 lapic video=rivafb:mode:1024x768x16 root=/dev/hda3 ro
initrd		/initrd.img-2.6.6

boot

Here's the mount output from the system running a 2.4 kernel:
lug:/tmp# mount
/dev/hda3 on / type xfs (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
/dev/hda2 on /home type xfs (rw)
/dev/sda2 on /var type xfs (rw)
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
