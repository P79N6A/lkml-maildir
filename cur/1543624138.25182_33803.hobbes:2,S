Its the standard everyone holds to, be they Dave Miller or IBM Corp. If
you wan't your driver in the main tree then its not something you need
to care about
The standard held for the mainstream kernel are very high - and they need
to be. Nobody makes you hold to it, and in fact that you have written a 
GPL driver is great - whatever it looks like. Its allowed those people who
do care to not only bitch about it but to actually go and try and do a
better job - at their own expense not yours.
