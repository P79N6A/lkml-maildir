Seek and read which files?  If you want anything but all files, you're
probably out of lock.  Again, you will have to seek if any of the
files are fragmented (which is the case with most fs).

In reality one would (in general) rarely need to read all the files -
at least, that's my gut feeling.  One might very well want to see a
list of all the files which can be fainfully slow with Unix.  Or, in
other words: 1) would be rarely used while 2 could be very useful in
the scenario that you give:
1)	seek_and_read(fd, path)
2)	seek_and_read(fd, path, file_name_regex)
And if file_name_regex is resonable complex (*b*, *cd?d.txt etc) you
will have to seek anyhow.  I assume you don't want different ordering,
right?
