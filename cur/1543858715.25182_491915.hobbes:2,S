No, I am talking about how to support modems which don't have a
command mode. These USB modems don't accept AT commands
through the same channel as data. They take them encapsulated in special
command messages to endpoint 0.
How do I export this capability to user space? I am thinking about having
two device nodes. But there may be a driver setting another precedent.
Therefor I am asking.
