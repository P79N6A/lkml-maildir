Well, about the bug report it could be me being lazy or not having
enough time... :)
It works with the old toshoboe driver.
If I load the module with "do_probe=0" donauoboe loads on the first try,
thanks for the hint:
toshoboe: Using multiple tasks, version $Id: donauboe.c V2.17 jeu sep 12
08:50:20 2002 $
This is what I dug up from an old bootlog (for the old toshoboe
messages):
Linux version 2.4.18-5.64LNX (root@LNX.iNES.RO) (gcc version 3.1
20020620 (Red Hat Linux Rawhide 3.1-7)) #1 Wed Jul 10 00:30:01 EEST 2002
[..snip..]
IrDA: Registered device irda0
ToshOboe: Using single tasks, version $Id: toshoboe.c,v 1.91 1999/06/29 14:21:06 root Exp $
ToshOboe: setting baud to 9600
[..snip..]
Let me know if I can be of any help.
