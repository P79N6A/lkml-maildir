I suggest you remove "Linux developer" from your sig. I had "Linux
Kernel Developer" in there for a while, and it was somewhat of a
recurring topic on debian-devel, and made me look like a pretencious
prick. So, unless your name's in CREDITS, or MAINTAINERS, it's not a
terribly good thing to put in your sig. :)
