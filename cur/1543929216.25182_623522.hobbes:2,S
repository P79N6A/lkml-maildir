Here's a *single* button click (press/release quickly):
Event: time 1196621063.612542, type 1 (Key), code 272 (LeftBtn), value 1
Event: time 1196621063.612553, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0

Here's another one, except I held the button firmly down for a second or so,
and then released it:
Event: time 1196621197.179635, type 1 (Key), code 272 (LeftBtn), value 1
Event: time 1196621197.179645, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
Event: time 1196621198.323607, type 1 (Key), code 272 (LeftBtn), value 0
Event: time 1196621198.323616, type 0 (Reset), code 0 (Reset), value 0
I'll go work on the CONFIG_HID_DEBUG thing next.
