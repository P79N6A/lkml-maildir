Hi,
i tested your patch, but it did not apply correctly to a clean 2.6.9-rc4
tree for me. (patch -Np1 -i ../patch-2.6.9-rc4-lapic-5)
I applyed it manually, and when rebooting, i get the following:
 Local APIC won't be reenabled, ...
 You can...
When booting with 'pci=noacpi':
 Local APIC won't be reenabled, ...
 You can...
When booting with 'acpi=off':
 no output when running dmesg|grep -i apic
