Worked for me this time as well.  I had a typo the first time then did
an ugly fix to a non-existent problem :(

Probably true, but I don't want to rule it out completely.  In any case
it is easily catered for in lib/Makefile.
obj-$(CONFIG_JFFS2_FS) += zlib.o
obj-$(CONFIG_PPP_DEFLATE) += zlib.o
# Uncomment these if ppc bootloader can use the common zlib
# ifeq ($(ARCH),ppc)
#   obj-y += zlib.o
# endif

Any new module that requires zlib requires a change to the zlib
selection.  Whether you do it in the top level Makefile, in
lib/Config.in or lib/Makefile is irrelevant, zlib has to be selected
somewhere and the criteria must be updated for new modules.
Since lib/zlib.c works for both built in and modules, there is no need
to change the top level Makefile.  AFAICT the above lines in
lib/Makefile are the minimal change.
