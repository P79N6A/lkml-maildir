forgot about the load:
It's an ftp server. official mirror for ubuntu linux, gentoo linux, eclipse 
SDK, etc. see 
ftp://ftp.rnl.ist.utl.pt
We also provide rsync service for gentoo portage users. The load tests we 
performed that eventually crashed the machine were about 10 simultaneous 
rsyncs pulling information from the server, the server was uploading with 
rsync via ssh at 10MB/s (100Mbit nic) and some spurious ftp download clients. 
It lasted about 30 minutes. With normal load, it lasts for about 12-14 hours.
I think it crashes better with rsync clients... it usually crashed at around 
00h, when some cronjobs fired rsyncs...
