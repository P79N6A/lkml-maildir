Must have been really short, I missed it coming in a tad late. In any
case, NY is nicely in the middle between CA and Europe, so any time good
on the ends will be fine here.

Please just give time in GMT and let us work it out! Between time zones
and daylight savings it's more confusing than useful.
Last week I went to Arizona from New York. It went like this: Sunday
morning 1hr forward for DST. Sunday later, 2hr back for central timezone. 
Sunday later 1hr more back, Arizona doesn't do DST, except... Monday, 1hr
forward again, the Navaho nation in AZ does do DST. At that point I set my
watch to GMT and told local time by the sun! Oh well, lots of brewpubs,
it's always time for a beer.
