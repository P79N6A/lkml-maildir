Hi,
I have here a recent Acer notebook which I plan to use with Linux. The
system I installed uses Kernel 2.4.20-ac1 which is the kernel we use
on most other production systems at our site. The notebook has an 810
chipset; the IDE chip is seen by the normal PIIX driver.
Linux 2.4.20-ac1 sees the PIIX chip, but not the disks connected to
it. This of course results in a kernel panic "unable to mount root
fs". Same thing happens with 2.4.20-ac2. Vanilla 2.4.20 works fine. Of
course, all kernels have been built with the same configuration.
2.4.20 is fine for this notebook, so this issue has no urgency for me
in any way. I just wanted to point out potential problems to the
people capable of investigating. I'll happily provide any information
that might be required.
Cheers
Marc
