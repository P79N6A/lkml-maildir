Yes.  The kernel either transforms it to EINTR, or restarts the syscall
when the signal handler returns.

strace is special here, because it gets more information than the traced

At this point the accept syscall hasn't actually finished yet, but rather
suspended to let the program execute the signal handler.  As soon as the
signal handler returns the syscall will be restarted.
