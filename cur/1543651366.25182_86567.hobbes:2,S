No, I think you have a good idea.  Pete is right, though, the current
interrupt is disabled... but normally the other interrupts are still
enabled.
Your ideas #2, #3, and #4 are good.
Because once the lock is tainted, you still want to ensure process
context disables interrupts before grabbing the lock.
