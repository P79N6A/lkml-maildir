Hi Nick, 
I'm having a good time reading this discussion, so let me jump in.
Sure, the "unfairness" between lowmem and highmem exists. Quoting what 
you said, "pages in higher zones have an advantage". 
That is natural, after all the necessity for lowmem pages is much higher
than the need for highmem pages. And this necessity for the lowmem
precious increases as far as the lowmem/highmem ratio grows.
As Andrew has demonstrated, the problems previously caused by such
"unfairness" are non existant with per-zone LRU lists.
So, yes, we have unfairness between lowmem and highmem, and yes, that is
the way it should be.
I felt you had a problem with such a thing, however I dont see one.
Am I missing something?
Regards
