The solution is another issue. I simply stated that the problem
happens with or without modules.

Works only for modules, not good.

That's a modules API problem. And yes, I think modules should
eventually be able to say that they're busy.

If all you want to do is to decrement the module count, you could
have a global handler for this that is guaranteed not to reside
in a module.
By the way, a loong time ago, in the modules thread, I suggested
a "decrement_module_count_and_return" function [1]. Such a
construct would be useful in this specific case.

And how would you ensure correct access to static data in the
absence of modules ? Any solution that _requires_ a module count
looks highly suspicious to me.
Likewise, possibly dynamically allocated data that is synchronized
by the caller, e.g. "user" in "struct proc_dir_entry".

Hmm, I'm confused. With "filesystem", do you mean the file system
driver per se (e.g. "ext3"), or a specific instance of such a file
system (e.g. /dev/hda1 mounted on /) ?
