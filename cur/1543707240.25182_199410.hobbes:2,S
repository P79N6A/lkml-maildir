It _looks_ like all four CPUs are madly taking timer interrupts.  Which
tends to point at some APIC problem, failing to clear the interrupt source.
But if that happened one wouldn't expect userspace to remain in a runnable
state, and you say that you can still run commands.

It is probably unrelated, but I'd suggest that you not use the nvidia
driver for a while, verify that the lockup happens without it loaded.
