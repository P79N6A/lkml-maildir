 Is the local APIC normally disabled, i.e. do you see a message like: 
"Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling." when you boot with your local 
APIC enabled?  That might explain the difference.

 I don't know what setup you are useing, but depending on the
implementation, the local APIC may treat ExtINTA interrupts as
level-triggered or as edge-triggered.  The latter setup is a design error
in my opinion (the 8259A has a level-triggered output) and may lead to
what you observe.  As the local APIC latches edge-triggered interrupts it 
receives (unlike the 8259A) a glitch on an interrupt line does not have to 
last long enough for a CPU to accept it for a spurious interrupt to be 
recorded.
