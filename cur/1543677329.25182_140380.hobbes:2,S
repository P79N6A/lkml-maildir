Yes.
The other Windows PC onsite that I was working on turned out to be
rebooting randomly.  When I investigated, turned out that it's the battery
backup.  Unplug the battery backup, and a few seconds later(maybe 10), the
computer would reboot.
Based on that damaged batterybackup, and that it just started doing it
yesterday morning, I'd say we had a lightning hit on the two buildings,
especially since we had a storm that night.
Both drives in the backup server were damaged, one was completely dead,
the other was barely running.  I was able to copy off all but about 10
files, of which all of it was easily replaceable anyways.
The drives were functional before the lightning hit.
