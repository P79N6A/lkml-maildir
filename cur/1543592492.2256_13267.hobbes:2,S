Because you are using a broken version of klogd that stuffs up oops
traces.  Change klogd to run as klogd -x (probably in
/etc/rc.d/init.d/syslog) so it keeps its broken fingers off the oops.
Since you are failing during modprobe, creating /var/log/ksymoops is a
good idea, man insmod, see KSYMOOPS ASSISTANCE.  Reproduce the
problem to get a clean oops trace then run it through ksymoops, using
the saved module data in /var/log/ksymoops.
