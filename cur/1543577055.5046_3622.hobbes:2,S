Hi all,
I am trying to mmap some kernel ram into user space... These r the steps i
followed..
1) Allocate memory in kernel using get_free_pages..
2) reserve these pages using mem_map_reserve macro
3) In the mmap () implementation i use remap_page_range to export the buffer
to user space..
All this works well in kernel ver 2.2.14 but i am not getting it right in
2.0.32... any idea why???
thanks in advance
azad
