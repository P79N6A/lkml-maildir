One of the advantages of IBM hardware. Too bad other manuafturers don't
learn from them...

It is a made-up term, but you hit the nail right on the head describing
it. What you describe here about the kernel not caring what
instructionsets the CPU supports, isn't this untrue? Ever tried to run a
binary compiled for PPC under x86? You get something an error message, eg:
zsh: exec format error
I think the kernel would have to know what instructionsets are available
on the CPU, but as far as what instructions each executable was compiled
with, it probably matters not.

The way I remember was a 486 core though...apparently they had some design
issues that halted the project.

Although I don't know much about the Crusoe per se, I do know a little
about how it works, with the code morphing and whatnot. As far as anything
goes, sure, this is a great idea, and can be real fast...But I think in
the future what we want is a CPU that is 'intelligent' and actually morphs
its machine code dependant on what instructions it will use on a per
program basis. Although this would take one HELL of an operating system to
pull off, it _would_ be possible. Think about it... At the assembly level,
you can count the unique instructions used, and any decent overoptimizing
compiler could reduce large multiple-cycle instructions into many smaller
single-cycle instructions, build an assembler header of the instructions
that are to be used by that program, have the kernel send that header to a
protected region in on-cpu memory, and have a small instructionset
tailored to the program being run at the moment, (minimizing lookup time).
basically it would mean having the hardware adapt to the code, and not the
code adapt to the hardware. As far as plauseability of this idea, I really
couldn't say... it seems pretty far-fetched but I think that it would be
possible if a few decent cpu designers put their heads together...

Face it, there are to many lemmings out there...windows isnt going to go
away anytime soon, so the slow x86 architecture isnt going to either.
just my 0.02 (mexican pesos, it aint worth much :P)
