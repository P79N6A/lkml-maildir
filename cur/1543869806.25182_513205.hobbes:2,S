i havent got around figuring out the last v2.6.20 based kevent release, 
and your git tree is v2.6.21-rc1 based. Do you have some easy URL for me 
to fetch the last v2.6.20 kevent release?

note that threadlets are not 'micro-threads'. A threadlet is more of an 
'optional thread' (as i mentioned it earlier): whenever it does anything 
that makes it distinct from a plain function call, it's converted into a 
separate thread by the kernel. Otherwise it behaves like a plain 
function call and returns.
