While it certainly is interesting, I can't see any other reason for running 
Linux on a disk drive.  Linux is far too heavy for an embedded marketplace, 
and it really doesn't make sense to run it there.  There are already enough 
splits in Linux targets as it is.  How you can have an operating system that 
runs well on single cpu workstations, scales up to 16-64 cpus, and also runs 
on microcontrollers and realtime systems is beyond me.  Perhaps if it was a 
microkernel it might be feasible.
What is the point of adding a general-purpose OS/CPU/memory system to a disk 
when everything can be done with a couple ASICs much faster and cheaper?  The 
memory footprint that Linux takes could instead be used for valuable disk 
cache.
Maybe if you are talking about huge disk cages, and the cost was amortized 
over a bunch of disks it would be feasible, but if you are talking about 
single drives, this is sheer madness.
