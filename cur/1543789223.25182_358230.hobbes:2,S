The 32 bit NX support and parts of the randomisation are incorporated
already. The segment limit hack will never be incorporated (but that's
ok; NX is the real solution and more and more systems out there support

gcc/glibc/binutils upstream codebases already.

The most current patch is always in the rawhide kernel rpm; once in a
while that gets put into a "released" patch, but the rawhide one is
updated daily or just about.
