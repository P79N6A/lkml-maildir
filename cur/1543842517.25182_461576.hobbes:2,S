That code sequence certainly has been known to generate very large
numbers of RCU callbacks very quickly in the past...  ;-)

Good point -- should get things going upon return from the next syscall.

As long as we don't do this too often...  One way to prevent doing this
too often would be to check rcp->completed against rdp->batch similarly
to __rcu_process_callbacks()'s checks.  In call_rcu(), perhaps something
like the following inside the ->qlen check:
	if (__rcu_pending(&rcu_ctrlblk, rdp) {
		tasklet_schedule(&per_cpu(rcu_tasklet, rdp->cpu));
	}
with similar code in call_rcu_bh().

My thought was that it might make sense to check only this CPU's struct
rcu_data.  But I agree that the next approach seems more promising.

And rcu_do_batch() already checks rdp->donelist anyway, so this code
could just be put into the "else" clause of the existing rdp->donelist
check at the end of rcu_do_batch().  So, yes, this does appear to be
the best approach.

Look forward to seeing them!
