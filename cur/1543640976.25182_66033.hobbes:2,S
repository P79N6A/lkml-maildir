Yes, I know about this one. But you never know how many different-type 
locks you'll find. In the worst case there's a kernelful of crap around, 
you know.

Hey, it's not all the world that is bad. I'm not just fixed on this bug 
here. I'm suggesting this as a serious finder for broken things which 
could be used all over the place.
(Of course my (and possibly even your) great dream is that we can find 
these things before we boot the broken kernel. Good old genparsetree.pl 
and a few AI might help here.)
