An example of custom power states for the TI OMAP family.
/sys/power/states supports a state named "deepsleep", which corresponds
to the platform state actually entered by the present-day system suspend
handler.  It no longer offers the option of "disk" suspend which would
not normally be available in an OMAP-based system, nor does it offer the
choices "standby" or "mem", which are currently somewhat arbitrarily
mapped to actual platform power states on OMAPs.  In the future the OMAP
could be extended to offer the choice of "big sleep" as well, another
platform-specific low-power mode that falls under the general category
of suspend-to-mem, once it is feasible to no longer use the same set of
system suspend state values for all platforms and drivers (as mentioned
in the base note).
