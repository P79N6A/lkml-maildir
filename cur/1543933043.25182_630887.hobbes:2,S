Take a machine, put two interfaces in it, configure as bridge (br0
over eth0 and eth1 without any assigned ip addresses), put it between
end node and the cisco. tcpdump there, which should give an unbiased
view wrt. endnode/cisco. Then perhaps, also configure such a network
listening bridge on the other side of the cisco, e.g. on the link to
the internet and watch that. Compare the two tcpdumpds and see if
sack got trashed.
