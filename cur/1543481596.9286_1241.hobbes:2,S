I am using a fairly recent version of glibc. I'm directly making 
an ioctl(TCSETS, &struct_termios) with the above shown parameters
set.
There are no errors. A connected modem works fine. However, this
is a long-used call-back program which runs fine at speeds at and
below 38400. However when I set the speed to higher values, I noted
that the modem would only connect at 1200 baud!
Therefore I got out my scope and timed it. (cat /dev/zero /dev/modem).
I measured the time between start-bits (zeros are only start-bits).
Assuming 10-bits/baud (1 stop, 1 start, and 8 data), the speeds are
as shown. Everything works fine if I use 38400 and set the SPD flag
with setserial.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
