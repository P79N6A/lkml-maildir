In the production case is when oom fires and kills things. I can only assume
memory is not being freed fast enough otherwise oom wouldn't get so upset.

It's 1/2+ million lines of code, there are a lot of steps. Other than saying
we create a 1.6GB shared memory segment up front, then load the high
availability iSCSI application, start I/O with some number of clients and
then launch an update. I'm not sure what detail you're looking for. Linus
seems to have the best summary of the problem so far saying that we have a
2GB system with 1.6GB dedicated and we want the OS to pretend there's only
400MB of memory.
