In theory you can register the fd at creation time with the full interest
set and you can leave it in there for its whole life without having to
call epoll_ctl() every switch between read/write. It's true that you could
receive false events, but by studying the frequency of those false events
on a "very high loaded" HTTP server, it resulted to be both very little
and uneffective on the server performance.
