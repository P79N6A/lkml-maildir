Thanks for the pointer. Same as ocfs2, under current VFS code, both 
GFS1/2 also need FS_ODD_RENAME flag for the rename problem - got an ugly 
~200 line draft patch ready for GFS1 (and am looking into GFS2 at this 
moment). The issue here is, for GFS, if vfs lock_rename() can call us, 
this complication can be greatly reduced. Will start another thread to 
see whether the wish can be granted.
