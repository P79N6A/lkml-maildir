[NK] Thanks for trying it out. The numbers from my post may be useful to
you.

[NK] While testing we had 4 100mbps NICs with 4 Way Intel P4 Xeon
1.6GHz. What is your system configuration? Some numbers from your
experiments would be useful in understanding the situation better. Also
what do you mean by no hyper-threading, Is HT disabled in the BIOS, or
the HT awareness is disabled in the code. I need more details of your
setup to test it out.

[NK] This case will work well if the CPUs are lightly loaded. For
Heavily loaded CPUs to let then perform their on task, it is required to
move the interrupts out of the package.
Thanks,
