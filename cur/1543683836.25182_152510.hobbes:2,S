Very strange, It was a 4.9 GB raw mpeg-ps file and I couldn't copy more than 914 mb of it using -test2, even playing the file from the server using mplayer didn't work (and I wasn't smart enough to use strace) then I rebooted with 2.4.20 and the whole file was copied. Now I tried copying a 990 mb wav file and it worked(using -test2). The orginal 4.9 GB file is not on the server now so I'll have to put it there first and then copy it again. It'll take some time on my slow NIC (and the server being a 300 Mhz laptop). I'll email you again, sorry.
And yes I have enough disk space on my system :>
