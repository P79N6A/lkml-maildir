Ok, thanks for the explanation.

If I'm going to get the proper patch from the proper network trees, I'll 
just drop my patch. Whether you replace "delayed_work" with "work_struct" 
or not is not something I really care about - if you think you may want to 
play with the timeout idea in the future, please feel free to continue 
using delayed_work.
But if you do use delayed work, please use the "delayed_work_pending(&x)" 
function, rather than doing "work_pending(&x->work)" and knowing about the 
internals of how the delayed-work structure looks.
So with that out of the way, I'll just expect that I'll get whatever you 
decide on through Davem's git tree, once his drunken holiday revelry is 
over ;)
