That's not quite right.  Leaving the code unchanged caused breakage
already.  The PIT is damn stupid and can be sensitive to how quickly it's
programmed.  So code that enable/disable didn't change, but frequency
with which it is called did and broke some random boxes.

It was that way for x86_64, that's the first thing I fixed (since it was
done by fully disabling all other timers but the one coverted ;-)
