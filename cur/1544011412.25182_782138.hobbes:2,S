Subject: [PATCH v7 0/8] Tunable sched_mc_power_savings=n
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The existing power saving loadbalancer CONFIG_SCHED_MC attempts to run
the workload in the system on minimum number of CPU packages and tries
to keep rest of the CPU packages idle for longer duration. Thus
consolidating workloads to fewer packages help other packages to be in
idle state and save power.  The current implementation is very
conservative and does not work effectively across different workloads.
Initial idea of tunable sched_mc_power_savings=n was proposed to
enable tuning of the power saving load balancer based on the system
configuration, workload characteristics and end user requirements.
The power savings and performance of the given workload in an under
utilised system can be controlled by setting values of 0, 1 or 2 to
/sys/devices/system/cpu/sched_mc_power_savings with 0 being highest
performance and least power savings and level 2 indicating maximum
power savings even at the cost of slight performance degradation.
Please refer to the following discussions and article for details.

The following series of patch demonstrates the basic framework for
tunable sched_mc_power_savings.
This version of the patch incorporates comments and feedback received
on the previous post from Andrew Morton.
Changes form v6:
----------------
* Convert BALANCE_FOR_xx_POWER and related macros to inline functions
  based on comments from Andrew and Ingo.
* Ran basic kernelbench test and did not see any performance variation
  due to the changes.
Changes form v5:
---------------
* Fixed the sscanf bug and checking for (p->flags & PF_KTHREAD)
* Dropped the RFC prefix to indicate that the patch is ready for
  testing and inclusion  
* Patch series against 2.6.28-rc8 kernel
Changes from v4:
----------------
* Conditionally added SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE flag to MC and CPU level
  domain to help task consolidation when sched_mc > 0
  Removing this flag significantly reduces the number load_balance
  calls and considerably slows down task consolidation and in effect
  power savings.
  Ingo and Mike Galbraith removed this flag to improve performance for
  select benchmarks.  I have added the flags only when power savings
  is requested and restore to full performance mode if sched_mc=0
* Fixed few whitespace issues
* Patch series against 2.6.28-rc8 kernel
Changes from v3:
----------------
* Fixed the locking code with double_lock_balance() in
  active-balance-newidle.patch
* Moved sched_mc_preferred_wakeup_cpu to root_domain structure so that
  each partitioned sched domain will get independent nominated cpu
* More comments in active-balance-newidle.patch
* Reverted sched MC level and CPU level fine tuning in v2.6.28-rc4 for
  now.  These affect consolidation since SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE is
  removed.  I will rework the tuning in the next iteration to
  selectively enable them at sched_mc=2
* Patch series on 2.6.28-rc6 kernel  
Changes from v2:
----------------
* Fixed locking order issue in active-balance new-idle
* Moved the wakeup biasing code to wake_idle() function and preserve
  wake_affine function.  Previous version would break wake affine in
  order to aggressively consolidate tasks  
* Removed sched_mc_preferred_wakeup_cpu global variable and moved to
  doms_cur/dattr_cur and added a per_cpu pointer to appropriate
  storage in partitioned sched domain.  This changed is needed to
  preserve functionality in case of partitioned sched domains
* Patch on 2.6.28-rc3 kernel  
Results:
--------
Basic functionality of the code has not changed and the power vs
performance benefits for kernbench are similar to the ones posted
earlier.
KERNBENCH Runs: make -j4 on a x86 8 core, dual socket quad core cpu
package system
SchedMC Run Time     Package Idle    Energy  Power
0	81.68	     52.83% 54.71%  1.00x J 1.00y W
1	80.70	     36.62% 70.11%  0.95x J 0.96y W
2	74.95	     19.53% 85.92%  0.90x J 0.98y W
The results are marginally better than the previous version of the
patch series which could be within the test variation.
Please feel free to test, and let me know your comments and feedback.
I will post more experimental results with various benchmarks.
Hi Ingo,
Please review and include in sched development tree for testing.
Thanks,
Vaidy
