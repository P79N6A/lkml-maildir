I lost (never saw) the first of this thread, BUT, if this is 2.6, I strongly 
recommend that settimeofday() NOT be called.  It will try to adjust 
wall_to_motonoic, but, as this appears to be a correction for time lost while 
sleeping, wall_to_monotonic should not change.
As to locking, ints off for UP, but you need the full lock for SMP systems.
