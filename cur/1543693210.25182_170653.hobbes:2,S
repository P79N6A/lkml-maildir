OK, carefully inspecting the logs explains the above. -aa2 breaks the
build
of i2c-2.7.0, but my script already removed the original i2c modules by
then. The failure is just another static HZ initializer situation.
I think that we need an option to revert HZ to a constant for people
that do not want to fight with this change for now (I am sure there
are other drivers in the wild that will take a while to catch up
with this change even after it makes mainline).
