Yes, it's trivially easy to figure out that block 193453 on /dev/hdb is bad.
It's even not too bad to map that to an offset on /dev/hdb4.  Even if you're
using LVM or DM to map stuff, it's still attackable.  But how do you guarantee
that block 193453 gets allocated to your badblocks file and not to some other
file that just tried to extend itself by 32K?
