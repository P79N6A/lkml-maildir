File corruption is evident, but this would have been caused by the hard reset or the crash in equal measure. Unfortunately, I was careless enough to just hit the reset button after hitting ctrl-alt-backspace a couple of times, but I know that either the X window system or the kernel hung entirely (I do not know whether the NumLock key was inoperable, but the cursor/system monitor/clock stopped moving. The clock displayed 23:59:59 when I returned to it at around 00:15. I am in the UTC+0 timezone; the system clock was therefore in UTC, but I had set it to "windows compatibility" mode (i.e. local timezone).
