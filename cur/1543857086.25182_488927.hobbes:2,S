Gcc should do it for us, afaik. I didn't check, but gcc is generally 
pretty good at combining logical operations like this, because it's very 
common.

Nope. Look again.
test_bit() with a constant number is done very much in C, and very much on 
purpose. _Exactly_ to allow the compiler to combine these kinds of things.
