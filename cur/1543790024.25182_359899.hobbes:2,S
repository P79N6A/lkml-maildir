It looks like you have enough memory free - the problem is that the 
driver is allocating a block of memory with order 3, which is 8 pages. 
Quite likely there are not enough contiguous free pages to satisfy that.
That's an awful big buffer size for a packet - I assume you're using 
jumbo frames or something? Ideally the driver and hardware should be 
able to allocate a buffer for those packets in multiple chunks, but I 
have no idea if this is possible.
