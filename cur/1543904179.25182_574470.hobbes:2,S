Chuck, my binaries run always into a segmentation violation. So
ENOENT is not the issue. (Notify it was on an x86-64.)

Yes, these files were present in the initrd.img file. I checked it
by unpacking the initrd.img file. Notify also that I used
git-bisect to identify the PIE patch. This requires successful
builds. Reverting the patch clearly resolved the issue at the end.
> Ulrich, did your initrd contain the correct .so?
Sure! I have only one klibc-*.so on my box in /lib. I diffed the
file in the unpacked initrd.img with the file in /lib and there
has been no difference.
I always recreate the initial ramdisk after the kernel rebuild
with make install and my own installkernel script, which uses
mkinitramfs. The mkinitramfs script ensures that the klibc so
object from /lib and the klibc binaries from /usr/lib/klibc/bin
are copied into the initrd image. Usually that works without any
issue on x86, x86-64. PPC can't use make install, but I use
mkinitramfs there too, which handles klibc the same way.

Rebuilding klibc doesn't make sense from my point of view. What
should be the point of it?
