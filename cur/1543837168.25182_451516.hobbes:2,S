Subject: [PATCH 04/14] V4L/DVB (4395): Restore compat_ioctl in pwc driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck@looxix.net>
The compat_ioctl support of the pwc driver was dropped during the last update of the driver.
I suppose it was by mistake. If yes here is the patch to restore the support.
