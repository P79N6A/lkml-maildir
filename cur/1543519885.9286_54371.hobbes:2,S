   Here's yet another patch for the driver stuff. This should take
   care of the drivers/sbus subdirectory. Does this look correct to
   everyone?
Please do not patch the 2.3.x SBUS drivers for Sparc.  I have
completely rewritten them and they also use sbus_readwxxx etc.
interfaces as well as a revamped DMA mapping interface as well.
I plan to merge back to Linus soon.
Later,
