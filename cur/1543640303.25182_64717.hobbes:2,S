If he does please co-ordinate with me. I've already done a chunk of
cleanup there (and Andre has done a load too). 
I want order to this. That means all the driver cleanup goes into 2.4-ac
(or "2.4-ide" or some suitable branch) first where we can verify we
aren't hitting 2.5 generic bugs and ide corruption is a meaningful
problem report. It means someone (not me) is the appointed 2.5 person
and handles stuff going to 2.5 (I'm happy to identify stuff that tests
ok in 2.4 as candidates). It also means random patches not going past
me.
If we can do it that way I'll do the job. If Linus applies random IDE
"cleanup" patches to his 2.5 tree that don't pass through Jens and me
then I'll just stop listening to 2.5 stuff.
Volunteers willing to run Cerberus test sets on 2.4 boxes with IDE
controllers would also be much appreciated. That way we can get good
coverage tests and catch badness immediately
