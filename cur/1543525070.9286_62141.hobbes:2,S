You might as well just ignore him/her/it as the said cretin clearly
has nothing worth hearing to say. Mother should have pointed out that
it's better to keep quiet and be thought a fool than to speak out and
remove all doubt.

nowhere near as stupid.

See my signature for comment on this...but note that I have to agree

clearly inferior...
Best wishes from Riley.
