And without sched O(1) it isn't ?
This doesn't have to be the scheduler problem, but a problem somewhere
else (low latency (?)).
For me it doesn't skip even under heavy disk (IDE), VM and cpu load
while while switching 1280x1024 workspaces really fast and for a long
time
[Athlon 850, Matrox G450, XF4.1, Window Maker]
(I use it with rmap11c + mini-ll + ah-IDE ... = -jl-11-mini + 18pre3)
