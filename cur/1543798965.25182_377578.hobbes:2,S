Hello Stephen,
thank you very much for your review and your comments.

The Gigaset driver isn't in fact a networking driver; but if you think
it's appropriate to CC the netdev list anyway then we'll be glad to do
so when we'll resubmit it with the modifications prompted by the
comments we received so far.

Quite so. We're happy to use existing infrastructure wherever
available. Thanks for pointing out some of it we had overlooked.

Unfortunately these don't fit our needs, as we are not dealing with a
network device, but with an ISDN device.

I couldn't find any existing macros of that kind in kernel.h, so I
assume you are referring to the ones in usb.h.
The usb.h versions of info(), warn() and err() macros prepend the
entire source file path to each message, which isn't appropriate for
our purpose of informing users or administrators (as opposed to kernel
hackers). The module name is much more informative for that audience.
Also, a notice() macro is missing entirely. In that situation, rather
than reinventing the whole set of macros with new names, or cluttering
our code by repeatedly writing them out in full, we decided on
modifying the existing macros as the most readable solution.
We will however rephrase the comment preceding these definitions in
order to clarify our reasons for doing this.

Um, no. As we couldn't find a fix which wasn't worse than the problem,
we've decided to just remove that FIXME note.
Generally, however, if all FIXMEs must be fixed before a driver may be
submitted then we'll have to continue maintaining our driver outside the
kernel for quite some time yet. IMHO such a requirement would clearly
contradict the spirit of Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt.
Of course, removing all FIXME notes would be a matter of a simple
editor command. But I do not think the community would be well served
by that. ;-)

It appears that in the kernel versions I have been working with,
struct tty_operations does not have a member "owner".
Thanks again for your time and effort. Your comments are appreciated.
