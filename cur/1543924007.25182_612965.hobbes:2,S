Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Noticed on PowerPC allmod config build:
drivers/scsi/aacraid/commsup.c:1342: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type
drivers/scsi/aacraid/commsup.c:1343: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type

Also fix some whitespace on the changed lines.
