Modules are loaded before non-root file systems are mounted, damn!
Looks like persistent data has to be stored in /lib/modules/persist (no
<version>, see earlier mail).  If somebody wants both a read only /lib
and persistent data then /lib/modules/persist must be a symlink and
they must mount the target file system before loading modules with
persistent data.
