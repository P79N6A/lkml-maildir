Add something like, ", except for a (how?) small time/space penalty."

It would be useful to clarify that this "subsystem_event" scheme is
only a suggested naming convention intended to limit collisions.

It would help to spell out the nature of the marker namespace.  Is it
global to the kernel?  Per-module?  Are conflicting "subsystem_event"
names but different format strings considered separate markers?
