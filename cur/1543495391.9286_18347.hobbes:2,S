Hi. 
I have met the similar problem here.
I have tried kernel 2.2.5,2.2.7,2.2.7-ac1,2.2.7-ac2 .
There is two machine , for personal homepage, one is runing http , and one is ruing ftp.
The users data is separate on both machine so I must mount them using nfs on both machine.
The nfsclient often hangs and the screen full of nfsxxx inodexxx (sorry, scroll too fast to see it clearly.)
When the machine hangs, I can ping it, and if I telnet the machine, it can connect but without response.
How could I do to help get rid this. It's an very annoyed bug.
