Odd.  Seems OK here.  How hard is it to make it occur?
I'd be suspecting a lost I/O completion from the device driver.  Are you
really sure that ext3 cannot be made to do the same thing?
Suggest you generate the `dmesg -s 1000000' output for both good and bad
kernels, do a `diff -u' on them and look for IDE complaints (or SCSI, if
you're on SCSI).
