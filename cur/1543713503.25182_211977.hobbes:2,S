Thanks for stating the obvious! :)
No, actually I'm changing memory protection with mprotect() inside the
handler, so when it returns the program can continue.
But that's not relevant to the OpenOffice problem.  They have a
program which traps SIGSEGV with 2.4 and terminates suddenly with 2.6.
Obviously they aren't just returning else it wouldn't work with 2.4.
