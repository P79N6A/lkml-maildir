Example: console. You want to be able to pass font changes. I'm
less than sure that putting them on the same channel as, e.g.,
keyboard mapping changes is a good idea. We can do it, but I don't
see why it's natural thing to do. Moreover, you already have
/dev/vcs<n> and /dev/vcsa<n>. Can you explain what's the difference
between them (per-VC channels) and keyboard mapping (also per-VC)?
Face it, we _already_ have more than one side band.
Moreover, we have channels that are not tied to a particular device -
they are for a group of them. Example: setting timings for IDE controller.
Sure, we can just say "open /dev/hda instead of /dev/hda5", but then we
are back to the "find related file" problem you tried to avoid.
