ISTR that the only use of the i2c_driver.command() mechanism
is for video/DVB driver support.  It's kind of an ugly wart,
and it'd be good to see such ioctl-ish interfaces vanish.
This came up a while back as part of a "how can we clean up
the I2C stack" discussion.  So it would be nice if V4L2 wasn't
effectively adding new reasons (and advice) to use this.
