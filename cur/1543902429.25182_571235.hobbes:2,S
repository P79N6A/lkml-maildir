The chunk_size is at 256KB, ext3 block size is 4k. I believe the correct
option that should be passed trough to --stride is 64.
Am I correct ?
I've also tested ( after sending my first report ) with xfs.
I've also increases readahead to 65535 on all HD's
I've also increases the stripe_cache_size to 16384.
I can now get ~100MB/sec...
