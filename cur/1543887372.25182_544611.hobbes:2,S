Subject: [patch 2.6.22-rc1] gpio interface loosens call restrictions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Loosen gpio_{request,free}() and gpio_direction_{in,out}put() call context
restrictions slightly, so a common idiom is no longer an error:  board init
code setting up spinlock-safe GPIOs before tasking is enabled.
The issue was caught by some paranoid code with might_sleep() checks.  The
legacy platform-specific GPIO interfaces stick to spinlock-safe GPIOs, so
this change reflects current implementations and won't break anything.
