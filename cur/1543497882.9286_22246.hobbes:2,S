Subject: file locking starvation?

[I posted about this a couple of weeks ago, when this list was being very
slow.  I never saw it appear, so am assuming it got lost]
Consider this situation:
    1. Process A locks a file, using fcntl(..., F_SETLKW, ... ).
    2. Process B tries to lock the file the same way, and so goes to
    sleep waiting for the lock.
    3. Process A releases the lock, but then immediately tries to
    reaquire it.
On Linux (2.2.9 is the only one I tested), process A gets the lock back in
step #3.  Anyone else think that step #3 should put A to sleep and let B
get the lock?  An application that wants that behavior can get it by throwing
in a sleep(0) between A's releasing the lock and attempting to reaquire it,
but is it supposed to have to do that?
