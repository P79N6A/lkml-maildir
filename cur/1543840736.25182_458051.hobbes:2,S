I am guessing that a recent update with kernel patches for
iosched-rollup-2.6.17.4-2.patch appears to have removed the problems
described here. With this and others installed, even with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
there are no more io problems being recorded with or without vmware mods.
For some reason, these patches are not in the vanilla 2.6.17.11 sources.
The particular kernel series I used for test were:
2.6.17.11 - problem persisted
2.6.17-beyond3.1pre1 - problem persisted
2.6.17-beyond4pre1 - problem solved ( for half a day anyway :) )
http://iphitus.loudas.com/beyond/2.6.17/2.6.17-beyond4pre1/
compare dmesg output at point of error:
Failure:
/dev/vmnet: open called by PID 9443 (vmware-vmx) 
eth0: Promiscuous mode enabled.
device eth0 entered promiscuous mode
bridge-eth0: enabled promiscuous mode 
/dev/vmnet: port on hub 0 successfully opened 
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC } 
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
NOW:
/dev/vmnet: open called by PID 11758 (vmware-vmx)
eth0: Promiscuous mode enabled.
device eth0 entered promiscuous mode
bridge-eth0: enabled promiscuous mode
/dev/vmnet: port on hub 0 successfully opened
( *** note, error occured here *** )
/dev/vmmon[11758]: host clock rate change request 83 -> 19
device eth0 left promiscuous mode
bridge-eth0: disabled promiscuous mode
/dev/vmmon[11752]: host clock rate change request 19 -> 0
This sequence occured several places, and no times were errors
reported.
HTH
So, for me, for now, this issue is resolved...
