An unpaired read on port 0x40 is almost certainly the cause of e.g.
    
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0206.0/1505.html
and we would expect to see the problem with count==LATCH about 1/11932
of the time, about 0.008% -- almost exactly the value reported in:
    
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0206.3/0043.html
I believe that by adding both the (count > LATCH) check and a second
(count == LATCH) check, we can fix both of these.
