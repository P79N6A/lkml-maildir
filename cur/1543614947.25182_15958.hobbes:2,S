Here's something I can't remember EVER seeing before at bootup:
"---SNIP---
Partition check:
hda: {everything fine here}
hdb: [PTBL] [1108 255 63] hdb1 hdb2 <hdb5 hdb6 hdb7 hdb8> hdb3
---SNIP---"
The PTBL stuff and 1108 255 63 (CHS??) !!! Why?
I tried 'e2fsck -f /dev/hdb3' and it returned:
"Filesystem has unsupported Read-Only features while trying to open
/dev/hdb3.
The SuperBlock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem.
....If it /is/ ext2 then the Sb is corrupt, run 'e2fsck -b 8193 <device>'"
So I do 'e2fsck -b 8193 <device>' and it says: "Bad magic number in SB
while trying to open /dev/hdb3"
For /dev/hdb5 it says: "Couldn't /find/ ext2 SB...trying backup
blocks...Bad magic number in SB while trying to open /dev/hdb5."
Any more ideas?? I already heard from Lionel Bouton to hook up the device
on it's old system but that'll have to wait till after Jan. 2nd.
TIA,
-Mike
