 Interesting changelog entries..
2.4.14:   hyperthreaded P4's
2.4.17:- Pentium IV Hyperthreading support              (Alan Cox)
2.4.18ac:o      Hyperthreading awareness for MTRR driver
Shame that .14 and .17 aren't more descriptive. I'm guessing
that they provided different bits. Not sure from memory what order
things happened though.
Maybe .14 was "Boot, and don't do anything silly" patches, whilst
.17 was the actual "take advantage of this feature" patch.
 *shrug*
