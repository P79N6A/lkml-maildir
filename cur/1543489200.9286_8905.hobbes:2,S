Most RISC CPUs now have a mode flag that puts them in big or little endian
mode, so this is no longer true. Some even have a bit in the instruction
word which indicates whether to do a big-endian or little-endian load or
store. 
Why? I'm going to speculate that Windows NT required it (for exactly the
same reason Linus demands it - for running x86 apps). Most of the current
RISC families started getting off the ground while NT 3.1 was in
development and everyone planned on having a port. The hardware to support
it is pretty minimal.
