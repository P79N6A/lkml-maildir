I found all sorts of interesting things in my little adventure...
Heres an interesting one;
drivers/fc4/fc.c:
 	l.fcmds = kmalloc (count * sizeof(fcp_cmnd), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!l.fcmds) {
                kfree (l.fcmds);
                printk ("FC: Cannot allocate memory for forcing offline\n");
                return -ENOMEM;
        }
