Hello,
I'm using a 64 bit variable in a switch statement.  Gcc is generating code
which make calls to __ucmpdi2, a function defined in libgcc.  I figured
out that it was the switch statement from examining the generated code.
The question is whether I should change C code to avoid constructions
which make calls to this routine (a little hard to determine a priori)
or if there is an appropriate way to add this to the kernel.
Best I can tell, __ucmpdi2 takes two 64 bit unsigned args, returning
0 if the 1st arg is less than the 2nd, 2 if greater, 1 if equal.  For
now, I have defined the function in my driver with those semantics.
For obvious reasons, I don't consider this a viable long term option.
thanks
jeremy
