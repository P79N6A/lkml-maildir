There is none.
In fact, there _cannot_ be any these days, since all recent kernrels have 
stopped using defconfig entirely, and favour using /etc/kernel-config 
instead (making it much easier to have per-machine default 
configurations).

We can ask people to enable it if they can't get their oops reports 
together (and whether they get their oops reports in shape by using the 
user-space ksymoops or the kernel version really doesn't matter).
