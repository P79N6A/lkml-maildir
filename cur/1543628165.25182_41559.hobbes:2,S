Those who now chose to carry out their development using the patch+email
method, and prefer to submit everything for discussion on lkml before it
gets included are now largely out of the loop.  Things just seem to *appear*
in the tree now, without much fanfare.  That's my impression.
Rather than Linux development becoming more open, as I'd hoped with the
advent of Bitkeeper, it seems to be turning more in the direction of 
becoming a closed club.  This may be fun if you're a member of the club.
Ah well, I'm a 'sorta' club member, why should I complain?  All the same,
I feel that something we all seemed to be headed towards with unity of
purpose is somehow becoming more elusive.  Being attacked personally for
having this feeling does not help.
