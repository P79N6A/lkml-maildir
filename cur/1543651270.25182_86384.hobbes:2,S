If you define "unmaintainably bad" as "having features you don't need"
then I agree. But since dump to disk is in almost every other commercial
UNIX, maybe someone would question why it's good for others but not for
Linux.
I can agree on stuff the non-hacker wouldn't use, but that is exactly who
uses the crash dump in AIX, the person who wants to send a compressed dump
and money to IBM and get back a fix. Netdump assumes external resources
and a functional secure network (is the dump encrypted and I missed it?)
which home users surely don't have, and remote servers oftem lack as well.
