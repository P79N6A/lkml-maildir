maybe, but why? Atomic ops are still a tad slower than normal ops and
every cycle counts in the wakeup path. Also, the solution is still not
correct, because it does not take other migration paths into account, so
we could end up with a sleeping task showing up on another CPU just as
well. The most robust solution is to simply not care about migration and
to care about the total count only.
