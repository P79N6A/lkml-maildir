     Well, use of kernel symbol table (/proc/ksym) (or exporting
unavailable functions)inside module is fine. I was looking for alternative
way of accessing(using) kernel symbols from user space other than system
call(outside kernel module), is it possible.
 And for this one solution iam thinking of is creating new system call from
the loadable kernel module itself, so the user can get access as usual.
thanks

Uh- sure- but that's not what I meant. gshekar didn't say *why* he wanted
it.
I myself would use a cat of /proc/ksyms to find out whether an SMP kernel
is
running or not to decide which driver to load (e.g.). I wouldn't use the
output of ksyms except as a hint for something useful (like which flavor
down
or __down is to be used this week)
