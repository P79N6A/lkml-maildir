Hi
I am writing a device driver that can send VLAN Tagged packets on
linux-2.4.19. I have written a function mydev_hard_header() and assigned
dev->hard_header to mydev_hard_header.
The function mydev_hard_header() creates ethernet header + VLAN header, if
the packet is not already tagged.
When I tried ping on this device, I am seeing that the first 6-7 packets
are tagged and later, they are all going untagged. mydev_hard_header()
function is also not being called for these packets. I have also confirmed
that the control is not going to mydev_rebuild_hard_header() function.
ARP packets are always getting tagged. This problem is seen only with ICMP.
Any guesses why this could be happening? Could there be any cache-related
issues?
Thanks & regards
Madhavi.
