Well, the quick&ugly glibc patch simply uses an environment variable, just 
because I wanted to bench the kernel build with using the same glibc+gcc.
Yes, it can be the default behaviour for the allocator. The patch handles 
calloc() correctly, by forcibly zeroing memory in such calls.
But other software must be taught too, to use MAP_NOZERO when they do not 
need zeroed memory. I did that for the gcc garbage collector.
