I'm seeing this kind of corruption during the tar zxf.
$ tar zxf linux-2.4.0-test11.tar.gz 
gzip: stdin: invalid compressed data--format violated
tar: Unexpected EOF in archive
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors
Currently running kernel is 2.4.0-test11-ac4 and the file is correct.
After the reboot there is no problem with uncompressing this file.
It possible that this problem is fixed with test12-pre3, but in
case its not I'm reporting this now (this already happend to me at least
three times with this kernel - also there are no messages in the kernel
log.
