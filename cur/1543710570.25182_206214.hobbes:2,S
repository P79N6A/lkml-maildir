On second thought, I already have introduced copyfile() in a way - the
link() syscall is hijacked for exactly that purpose and my ugly flag
multiplexes between them.  Yeah, ugly as hell, but enough to get
started and test things.
Once the data structures are clear and at least one filesystem can
deal with it, things should be stable enough to think about the user
interface more seriously.
