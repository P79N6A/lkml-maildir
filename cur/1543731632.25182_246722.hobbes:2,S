Hmm, I think not the modify/overwrite phases performance were the problem.  The
modify and overwrite mongo phases fragment the filesystem too much, it had a
bad effect visible in the read phase and even in delete phase.  
We measured/optimized read performance  in assumption that fs is not
fragmented, why we should measure bad effect of overwrite instead?  
other fs do not relocate already allocated blocks, negative effect of 
file set overwrite is zero for them.  We could do the same for reiser4
by tuning flush algorithm and journal blocks allocation.
If users want to see read and delete performance as they are, overwrite phase
should be excluded, at least until we teach flush algorithm to not break good
block allocation.
If one wants to measure overwite performance, it is easy to enable overwrite
phase in mongo, but read and delete speed will be affected (it was so when I
tried to optimize delete).

not whole file set.  I mean it is unusual to overwrite all files in the fs.

There are other ideas :) but, it seems to me, if we will focus on benchmarks,
we never complete plugins, metafiles and other useful things.  What I want
from reiser4 is a possiblity to encrypt and compress ~/Mail/ :).
