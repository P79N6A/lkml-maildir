How would it learn? If everybody is going to set their default
route to your box A, and box A routes internally, then box A needs its
default route to go to the internet-box B.
The existnce of ICMP redirects means that your network is not
configured correctly. They are a symptom. A correctly configured
network does not have ICMP redirects.
