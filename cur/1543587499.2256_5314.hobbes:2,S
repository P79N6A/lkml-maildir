I have found the bottleneck in the CML2 configurator's startup time
and nailed it.  On my laptop, the time to read in and commit the i386
defconfig has dropped from 12 seconds to less than 2.  This fix will be
in the next release; expect it late today or tomorrow.

oppression: for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that
will reach unto himself.
