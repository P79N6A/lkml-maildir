I have an SMP Via VP6 mobo. Here is an excerpt from dmesg:
apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x07 (Driver version 1.16)
apm: disabled - APM is not SMP safe (power off active).
then:
ACPI: APM is already active, exiting
That's weird, because I left apm only to power off the machine
(otherwise it doesn't), knowing that it wouldn't be enabled because of
the SMP mobo. ACPI should still work.
(OTOH, I finally disabled ACPI because (after compiling without APM) it
appears it randomly freezes or reboots my machine ..)
