HI all,
Thanks for all the help.  I have switched to a low-end 16-bit PCMCIA
network card by 3COM 3C589 10/BT.  And now everything works as it
should.  Before making this change, I thought that my problem was caused
by the TCP/IP layer -- between Linux and Sun, because I could get good
network performance between two Liux boxes.  Anyhow, after start to use
this 3COM card, it works.  So, I think the problem IS Xircom Cardbus
card related.  
Thanks to all who responded! ... The best thing I got back from this
that the support from Linux is just good as ever... and it is the
problem with the Xircom driver, not the TCP/IP layer... :-)
