This sounds like a side-effect of the "CPU Cycle Saver" feature to
bundle Rx packets per one interrupt.  See
Documentation/networking/e100.txt.  I haven't tried your setup, but I
would guess that you can play around with the BundleSmallFr module
parameter, or better yet, if you want the lowest latencies, turn off CPU
Saver (ucode=0).
CPU Saver trades latency for reduced interrupts, resulting in CPU
savings, hence the name.
Hope this helps.
