Why would ROM space generally need to be non-prefetchable? I can
see that special cases might require this, but as long as ROM space
really is just normal code and data, there's nothing wrong with
prefetching from it I would think. Of course I realize there's no way
to specify that on a per-device basis, so I think the BIOS must be
relied upon here.

Attached. *.0 is with the patch, *.1 is with it reverted. All output from
the SLE10SP2 (2.6.16.54-based) kernel that has that patch backported.
I'd also like to note that I found that a second of the systems I'm
regularly dealing with also has similar problems. I'm just not normally
looking at the boot messages that closely.
