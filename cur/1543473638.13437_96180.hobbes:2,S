Oops are already logged to kernel log.  But if klogd or syslogd are not
running then the Oops never gets written to disk.  Alas this occurs all
too often.  Mind you, the real problem is that users do not read
Documentation/oops-tracing.txt.  I don't think that there is a
programming solution for that :(.
