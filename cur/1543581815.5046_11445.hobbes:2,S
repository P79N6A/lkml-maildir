Subject: Multicast on loopback?

In developing multicast applications, I would like to be able to test
locally over the loopback interface. This does not work without adding a 
bogus route statement to get the kernel to hand up the packets from
loopback to my waiting application.
This route statement is not necessary with other network drivers, so I
assume that adding some logic to the loopback driver would fix this
problem. Is it possible to get this added?
