If the mkswap doesn't nuke the filesystem, the first time we actually
send a page to swap will do the job.  Plus, there's more chance of paging
on a filesystem and managing to *not* notice, if we merely corrupt data
by dropping an essentially random 4K page on top of 4K of file data and
manage to not hit any metadata.
Maybe have mkswap check the partition table and not do it if the partition
isn't id=82 (Linux swap) unless -f is specified?  Not sure what to do if
the space is a loop or LVM device though.....
