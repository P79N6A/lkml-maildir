The current job package is job-1.4.0-1, you can find it at 
ftp://oss.sgi.com/projects/pagg/download
And it is correct that JOB_ATTACH ioctl is not implemented right now.
We could implement that ioctl and also add a user command like jattach.
We are trying to push the job kernel module to the community, but the ioctl
and /proc binary interface seems not an appropriate kernel and user space
communication interface. When job gets more users other CSA and there are
more interest about job, maybe we could request a new syscall number 
in linux.
