But, a __get_user(), once you scrap off all the gcc wrapping, is bacially 
a move. That could even be removed, but really I don't see the reason 
since it allows for a cleaner strcture definition in userland.

But this does not allow more than one context to be set at a time, like 
the current implementation does. Ie, the current implementation allow you 
to:
#define SYSIND_CTX_OPENFLAGS    0
struct sysind_ctx_OPENFLAGS {
	__u32 ctx;
	__u32 flags;
};
#define SYSIND_CTX_SIGSET       1
struct sysind_ctx_SIGSET {
	__u32 ctx;
	__compat_sigset set;
};
struct sysind_ctx_OPENFLAGS octx;
struct sysind_ctx_SIGSET sctx;
struct indirect_ctx *ctxs[2];
unsigned long params[6];
octx.ctx = SYSIND_CTX_OPENFLAGS;
octx.flags = O_CLOEXEC;
sctx.ctx = SYSIND_CTX_SIGSET;
sctx.set = SIG_XYZ | SIG_ABC;
ctxs[0] = (struct indirect_ctx *) &octx;
ctxs[1] = (struct indirect_ctx *) &sctx;
params[0] = blah;
params[1] = blew;
...
res = indirect(__NR_xxxx, ctxs, 2, params);
So you basically keep the context strcture separated, and allow to pass 
down more then one context to be set.
Another solution would be to have:
struct sysind_ctx_OPENFLAGS {
	__u32 flags;
};
struct sysind_ctx_SIGSET {
	__compat_sigset set;
};
struct monster_struct {
	__u32 size;
	__u64 flags;
	struct sysind_ctx_OPENFLAGS octx;
	struct sysind_ctx_SIGSET sctx;
	...
};
Where size gives you the size of the monster structure, and every bit on 
flags tells you which strcture inside monster is valid.
But I'd clearly prefer the former.
