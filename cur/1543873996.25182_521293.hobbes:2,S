I can't fully qualify what aspects of the X server that's creating this
problem. More experimentation is needed (various display drivers, etc...)
should be played with to see what kind of problematic situations arise.
It's a bit too new with too few users to know what are the specific
problems just yet. Your case is too sparse for it to be an completely
exhaustive exploration of what's failing with this scheduler.
There's a policy decision that needs to be made of whether adding another
term to the scheduler calcuation is blessed or not. My opinion is that
is should be. Meanwhile, we should experiment more with different
configurations.
