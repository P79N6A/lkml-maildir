    So what? PIO mode != ATA spec version. ATA-1 specified modes 0 thru 2.

    I think we'll take care of it soon -- as I said we've discovered pre-EIDE 
disk support lately, just before your report...

    Yeah, hopefully.
    The mode interesting question is how to diable IORDY throrling on host if

MBR as well. :-)
