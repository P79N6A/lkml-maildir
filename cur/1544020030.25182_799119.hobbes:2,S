Ahh. Yes. VM_CAN_NONLINEAR is a "reverse flag", ie unlike the other flags 
it's to some degree about being extra _normal_, not about being odd. Most 
special flags tend to disable the VM from doing some clever thing, this 
one enables it.

Yeah. Just masking it off when comparing is probably the simplest option. 
Make it a separate #define just for readability. There might be other 
flags like this in the future.

Yay for you ;)
And yes, this is the kind of thing that probably does mean that we're 
better off with the no-semantic-changes patches in -stable.
