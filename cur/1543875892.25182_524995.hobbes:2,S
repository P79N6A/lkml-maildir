The shadow driver support works now.
The most largest problem is HID/Bluetooth can not work now. And, I have
no any bluetooth input device to test, So ...
I think I should port current implementation to 2.6.21-rc5-mm2, and
support hiddev, then release it.
The last word is a question, what's the future of hiddev? It will merge
into hidraw later?  I think so, but can't sure.
