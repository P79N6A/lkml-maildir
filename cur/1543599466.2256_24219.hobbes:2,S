Installed e2fsprogs 1.23. It does not print warning now on
"fsck /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target1/lun0/part1"
However, it still cannot fs check root fs when given "fsck /" which I
really need in my init script. Now the only way to do root fs check
for me is to parse /proc/mounts and extract mount point for / via sed
(I have never used sed yet...).
# fsck /
Parallelizing fsck version 1.15 (18-Jul-1999)
e2fsck 1.15, 18-Jul-1999 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
/sbin/e2fsck: Is a directory while trying to open /
The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2
filesystem...
Best regards,
VDA
