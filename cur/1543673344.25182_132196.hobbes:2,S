I've posted a driver to the linux-hotplug-devel mailing list a year or
so ago that might help you out with this.  On module load it rescans the
PCI address space, adding or removind devices that are new or now gone.
This will probably do what you want.
I didn't write the driver, and it's probably very out of date by now,
but it's something for you to start with if you are interested.
Good luck,
