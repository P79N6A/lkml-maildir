It's worse than that.  A simple byte-at-a-time memcpy will work OK in some
predictable way, but optimised memcpy implementation will use a mixture of
byte, word and even cache line memory reads/writes depending on the CPU and
memory architecture.  This will completely confuse the hardware byte-swizzler
and you end up with a complete mess.
The solution, I suppose, is to have memory instructions with always use a fixed
endianness, regardless of what the page endianness properties are, but "clean"
and "elegant" are long gone.
