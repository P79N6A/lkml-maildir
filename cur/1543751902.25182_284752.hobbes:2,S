Large IT businesses already deployed 2.6 (SuSE) and will do so more soon
(Red Hat). These vendors are guaranteeing long term stable maintenance
of those versions.

Binary module support is pretty irrelevant. Good management of out of
tree source code recompiling is a much more useful and relevant topic. 
2.6 has caused an inadvertent problem there because with 2.4 it was
*much* easier to grab 2.4.x and drop in a 2.4.y version of a driver.
