Hey, colour ls is _useful_!

No, that's because (a) if 99% of packagers use sed in the right way and
one makes a mistake, all the packages are broken; (b) no package manager
I know of lets you mark a file as belonging to a package
(e.g. inetd.conf to inetd) while doing a sed-like update of the skeleton
part of the file, but keeping the changes from other packages.
Now for an example which does it nicely, see GNU Info, `install-info' :-)
