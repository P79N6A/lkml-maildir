Hmm - I think that if you call with NULL dest, and have it advance the 
pointer, you could do the same thing with something like:
 /* see how many bytes are in the buff */
 length = early_copy_log_buff(NULL, NULL);
 /* advance the pointer, so we only copy the last 1k */
 if (length >= 1024 )
    left = early_copy_log_buff(NULL, length - 1024);
 /* copy to temp buffer, to save to flash */
 early_copy_log_buff(buff, 1024);
 save_buff_to_flash(buff);
That way - you can put this in the standard places for failure, and still have 
only one function polluting printk.c (Although if you want to use it for 
failure trapping - it's up for "normal" run time use, and doesn't go into 
__init.

Adding a few more 'embedded' folks - who might have some thoughts/opinions.
