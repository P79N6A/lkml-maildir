Hmm... Could you please provide error log.
Networking is only used for netlink notifications which are disabled 
if CONFIG_NET is not set, you can find empty declarations in
w1_netlink.c
drivers/w1/Makefile has following for that case:
ifneq ($(CONFIG_NET), y)
EXTRA_CFLAGS    += -DNETLINK_DISABLED
endif
