Howdy.
I'm having problems getting the CS4236+ driver to recognize my 
  CS4236B card.  pnp finds it on boot:
isapnp: Scanning for PnP cards...
isapnp: Card 'CS4236B'
isapnp: 1 Plug & Play card detected total
but the ALSA driver doesn't pick it up.
isapnp detection failed and probing for CS4236+ is not supported
CS4236+ soundcard not found or device busy
Furthermore, after fudging with manually setting it up via modprobe
  options, it's still not loading:
CS4236+ soundcard not found or device busy
This used to work in the 2.4 series kernel without any modprobe.conf
  settings; the OSS driver would pick it up.
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated; this is the only thing holding
  me back from 2.6 goodness.  ;)
[config, pnpdump, and other information available on request]
