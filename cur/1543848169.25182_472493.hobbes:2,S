I put an assert about the page being locked in journal_dirty_data, and hit it 
right away.  I'll look a bit more but I think this is how I got there:
ext3_ordered_writepage <-- assert PageLocked
	...
	block_write_full_page
		__block_write_full_page
			unlock_page()
	...
	walk_page_buffers
		journal_dirty_data_fn
			ext3_journal_dirty_data
				journal_dirty_data <-- find page unlocked
there's a comment in ext3_ordered_writepage:
         /*
          * The page can become unlocked at any point now, and
          * truncate can then come in and change things.  So we
          * can't touch *page from now on.  But *page_bufs is
          * safe due to elevated refcount.
          */
