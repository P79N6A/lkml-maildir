Actually, there is a question as to how to sign off on something that
eventually gets rolled into something larger? Simply collect all the
signatories? Andrew aggregates patches on a fairly regular basis. How
about stuff that gets merged from the CVS trees of public projects? I
think we need a way to say "this came from an aggregate external
source" for patches that aren't simply passed along one by one.
Perhaps something like:
Signed-off-by: J Random hacker <foo@bar.com> from 
http://baz.sourceforge.net
