There does look to be a regression in unmap_region.
Though I'd be reluctant to assign much general significance
to any of these numbers (suspect it might all come out quite
differently on another machine, another config, another run).
But the probable best course is just to inline vm_acct_memory
as you did, but also uninline vm_unacct_memory: placing the
static inline vm_acct_memory and then vm_unacct_memory just
before vm_enough_memory in mm/mmap.c.
