"We know."  It never has. (and arguablly never will.)

If "by hand" means with 'patch', then yes.  Some people have no problem and
others commit suicide as a result of the process.  (YMWV.)  Getting the
DPT supplied driver to work in 2.3 will require some work -- spinlock
semantics and the scsi host structure changed.
I'm running a SRV in my system with 2.4.0-test5 right now, so it is doable.
