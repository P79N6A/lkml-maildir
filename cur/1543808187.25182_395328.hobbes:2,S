You mix things up. As this thread is about writing CD's and cdrecord, 
nobody here really wants you to use libscg to do your IO. Nobody here 
wants cdrecord to be able to access any type of device - all of the 
users of cdrecord just care about CD writers (and maybe DVD writers). 
That is because you call your program cdrecord and not scanimage oder 
cpuinfo. Actually none of the users of cdrecord even cares about how it 
is able to talk to CD writers. They know that all other operations to 
the CD writer can be done via /dev/cdrw, or however it is called on 
their system, and would like to use the same device name to write a CD. 
If libscg is unable to handle device names and needs to be feed with 
strange numbers to address the writer, then libscg may be the wrong 
tool.

I don't expect cdrecord to be able to do any of these jobs. I'd just 
like to write a CD. To be honest - even if libscg would be able to peel 
carrots I couldn't care less.
As for cdrecord I'm just one of those stupid users. I have a problem 
(write a CD) - I'd like to solve this problem. And if the device 
addressing scheme of cdrecord is different to all I've seen before from 
all the other tools in my system, I blame cdrecord to be annoying not 
the rest of my system - just because I have to investigate how to deal 
with this program, instead of just being able to use it like all the 
rest.
My 2 cents
