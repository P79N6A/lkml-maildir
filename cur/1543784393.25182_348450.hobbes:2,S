That's right.

Jackson-san's idea looks good for me because users don't need
to create special cpusets (parents of subcpusets or subcpusets).
From the point of users, maybe they wouldn't like to create 
special cpusets.
As for the resource controller that I've posted, it assumes
that there are groups of tasks that share the same cpumasks/nodemasks,
and that there are no hierarchy in that groups in order to make
things easier.  I'll investigate how I can attach the resource
controller to the cpuset meters.

Correct.  Subcpusets can't make child cpusets, and they don't have
cpumask/nodemask properties actually.  Properties like cpumasks/nodemask 
of subcpusets are the same as their parent and subcpusets can't modify
those properties.
