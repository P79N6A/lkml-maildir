Obvious now you've pointed it out. Bit of of a weird way to do things.
I might brew up a patch which adds the names to the 
pci_mmcfg_hostbridge_probe struct, since they appear to be always 
returned if the probe function is called, and make the probe functions 
return the config num.
Cheers,
Scott
