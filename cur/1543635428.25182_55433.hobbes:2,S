Larry, there's something I've always wanted to ask you about your
idea of the "locking cliff": when you're counting the number of locks,
are you looking at the running image of an OS or at the source? 
I mean, suppose we have a file object, with its private lock used
to protect access to its "internals" (whatever that means): of course
we may have thousands of these locks living in the running image of
the OS at a given time (most of them unused, BTW). At source level,
it is only one lock, instead. So are you worried about the proliferation
of locks in the source or in the live image of the OS? (I can see 
arguments against both.)
.TM.
