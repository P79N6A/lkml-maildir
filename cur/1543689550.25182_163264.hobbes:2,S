Besides that Andy Polyakov patch for mount -w of dvd+rw, the web has
Jens Axboe patches for mount -w of cd-rw, via the udf faq (Not via the
udftools faq):

>From these two clues, kindly offline people have identified the Four
fragments of kernel source that cooperate to conclude erroneously that
dvd+rw etc. are not writable:
1)
drivers/scsi/sr.c understands only the CDC_DVD_RAM profile of the seven
standard mmc "writable" device "profile"s, because sr.c neglects to look
beyond the "Capabilities" mode page x2a i.e. does not look beyond the
mmc 1 standard of 1997.  Ansi did not publish an op x46 Get
Configuration standard until the mmc 2 of 1999.
2)
include/scsi/scsi.h does not yet #define GET_CONFIGURATION 0x46.
3)
drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c also understands only CDC_DVD_RAM: cdrom.c
erroneously claims all mmc profiles except CDC_DVD_RAM are not
FMODE_WRITE-able.
4)
include/linux/cdrom.h names only CDC_DVD_RAM.

Anyone have an idea of how best to patch this?
I've seen a few linux-2.6.0-test4/ and linux-2.4.22/ alternatives mostly
work.  Anyone interested in evaluating some of them?
