Behind a barrier is not the preferred form for modification. Encrypted with
a key you don't have is not the preferred form for modification.

I honestly don't see what relevance this could possibly have. Getting access
to the source is a fundamental GPL right. The GPL is clear that you cannot
burden access to the source.

Of course your nonsense view leads to nonsense results. What a surprise. By
this argument, shipping a GPL'd work in ROM would violate the GPL because
you cannot easily modify that particular copy. Burning a GPL'd work to CDROM
would also be a violation. (See below for why your 'artificial' distinction
is wrong.)

Nope, sorry. If this were true, you ought to be entitled to modify a bit in
the Linux kernel and have it have the same effect as modifying that Linux
kernel on my desktop. Again, nonsense view leads to nonsense conclusions.
The fix is to reject the nonsense view. There are no special GPL rights to
particular copies of works or particular hardware.

Intent is not the issue. The GPL does not care whether you intended to
comply or why you cannot comply, it just cares whether you do or don't
comply. If modifying software in this way is a GPL right, then anything that
prevents you from modifying software in this way is a GPL violation. If you
can't distribute so as to give all GPL rights, you can't distribute at all.
If the GPL says I can modify my distributed copy, then distributing on CDROM
is a GPL violation. It doesn't matter what your intent is. If you can't
distribute so as to honor all GPL rights, you can't distribute.
It is mind-bogglingly obvious that any sort of "right to modify one
particular copy" is *not* a GPL right.

It doesn't matter. The GPL does not distinguish between artificial
restrictions and other restrictions. It doesn't permit *ANY* further
restrictions on GPL rights. If you can't grant all the rights (whether due
to artificial restrictions or other types of restrictions) you can't
distribute at all.
You are wasting an awful lot of time and effort analyzing things that have
*NO* GPL consequence at all.
