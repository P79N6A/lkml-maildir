Hi every one,
    I have a problem not clear: Is there any counter for the user number
in linux?
I want to do anexperiment which will get the number of current user in
the system and try fair-share scheduling based on it. I read the sys.c
and user.c but cannot find a counter for it. Is there any counter for
this things?
    If no, where can I put the inc instruct and dec instruct  or the
counter? in the uid_hash_insert and uid_hash_remove?
    Thank you!
