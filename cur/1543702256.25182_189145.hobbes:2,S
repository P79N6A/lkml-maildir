The one between you and viro?   I read the logs last night.  I didn't
see much discussion at all.

Yes.  It is somewhat policy, but as it currently stands, the kernel not
being able to give userspace the option is itself quite restricting.

Basically, consider Plan 9 namespaces (I admit I'm no expert on Plan 9
:).  I'm told it allows one to somehow share namespaces with other users
/ processes as long as they exists.   Linux has a per-process namespace
model that (currently) doesn't allow this to happen.  Once all processes
that share a namespace die, the entire namespace ceases to exist.  In
order to 'reconstruct' a namespace, a service could somehow say: "Use
this automount configuration" (manually by creating a fresh namespace,
removing all non-essential mounts, and installing new mount-traps within
this namespace).
This of course has corner cases like the chicken and egg problem where
the configuration files have to be available in that namespace already,
but with some thought we could figure that out.  (Something similar to
the way 2.6 uses rootfs could be used to strap into this fresh
namespace, entirely from userspace).
This would in effect allow me to say "Take a snapshot of my namespace"
(this would probably require more help from individual filesystem
implementations in order to get all the mount information used) which
would dump an automount map that could later be used to lazily recreate it.
Just a thought.
