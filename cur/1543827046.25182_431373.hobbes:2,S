...and how are distros going to deploy this?  They are going to turn on 
extents by default.
And do we honestly think that is a scalable option _anyway_?  That will 
slowly bloat fstab and mount command lines with an ever-increasing list 
of options.
It's IMO better experience for the user, and gives the developers more 
freedom.Look, I _really_ want extents.  I am a big fan.  But I think 
that extents are good time to make a clean break, and let ext3 live as 
it is.  And it will let ext3 stabilize.
