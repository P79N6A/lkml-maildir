I don't like this approach as I mentioned before. IMHO it is adding
unnecessary overhead to the runtime point. Why should one pass in the
mask 5 times when it is enough to use pci_set_consistent_dma_mask
etc. For the consistent allocations it's just a nuisance however if
you add this to pci_map_*() then it's going to add real overhead to
the hot paths of drivers which is just plain wrong.
I still haven't seen a strong argument for the current API being
insufficient. Alan mentioned one device causing the problem with
multiple consistent masks, but are there many more device like that
out there?
