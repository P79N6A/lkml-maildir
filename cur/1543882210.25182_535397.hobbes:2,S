The vector of forces is always 3d in our world.

With phantom it still seems doable - if I understand correctly ther is
one point of containct and one resulting vector of forces applied to
user's hand. With the glove there are multiple points of contact and
multiple feedback effects applied to different part of hand
simultaneously and that is for sure requires special application.
