Ok, I don't know exactly what you're talking about, but I have in the
past tried to hack that area as well. It's probably a good idea to
pick up my old patch and work from there, by making these two file systems
understand all possible ways:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
/* anything the user may be passing to us */
#define NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID16 _IOW('n', 2, u16)
#define NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID32 _IOW('n', 2, u32)
#define NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID64 _IOW('n', 2, u64)
#else
/* what the user is _supposed_ to pass */
#define NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID _IOW('n', 2, __kernel_old_uid_t) /* 16/32 bit */
#define NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID2 _IOW('n', 2, unsigned long) /* 32 or 64 bit */
#endif
int ncp_ioctl(struct inode *inode, struct file *filp, ...)
{
	...
	switch (arg) {
		...
	case NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID16:
	case NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID32:
	case NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID64:
		{
			unsigned long tmp = server->m.mounted_uid;
			if ((file_permission(filp, MAY_READ) != 0)
			    && (current->uid != server->m.mounted_uid))	{
				return -EACCES;
			}
			switch (arg) {
#ifdef CONFIG_UID16
			case NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID16:
				SET_UID(tmp, server->m.mounted_uid);
				if (put_user(tmp, (u16 __user *)argp)) 
					return -EFAULT;
#endif
			case NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID32:
				if (put_user(tmp, (u32 __user *)argp)) 
					return -EFAULT;
#ifdef CONFIG_64BIT
			case NCP_IOC_GETMOUNTUID64:
				if (put_user(tmp, (u64 __user *)argp)) 
					return -EFAULT;
			}
#endif
			return 0;
		}
	}
	...
}
I'm also posting the two patches I made a long time ago as a reference.
