I'd guess  you can change the module install path, and re-run 'install'
without having anything rebuilt.  Admiditly a bit worse off than
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/nfs/boxA.  Or set the install paths to
.../kernel-XXX/, tar and untar.
Or if /usr/local/src/linux is NFS'ed, and you're installing per box, I
don't get it.  Wouldn't you always install modules into /lib/modules/XXX
?
