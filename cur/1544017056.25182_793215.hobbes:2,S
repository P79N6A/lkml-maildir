I absolutely hate the idea of rw cost numbers. Why? Because it's a
property that's impossible to present as a single number. It depends on
so many different things, like cache settings and access pattern. If you
just want to know the avg seek time of your device, look at the reported
RPM value. Userspace can do that, because the kernel doesn't really care
a whole lot about it to be honest.
