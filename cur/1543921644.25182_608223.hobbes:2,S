Just boot your present system with MEM=nnn on the command-line,
where nnn is the amount of memory you would like to use in the
new system (like this).
title Fedora Core (2.6.16.24)
 	root (hd0,0)
 	kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.16.24 ro root=LABEL=/ mem=768m nmi_watchdog=0 
rhgb reboot=cb
 	initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.16.24.img
