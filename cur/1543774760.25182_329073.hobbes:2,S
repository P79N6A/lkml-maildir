 Strange -- boxes have started to appear that have no connectors or at 
least PCB headers for them.  What's the point in removing connectors and 
leaving the (otherwise useful) hardware inaccessible?

 Indeed, but APICs make them redundant.  I recall ACPI has defined 
additional "board" timers as well, hasn't it?

 Adjusting software to get rid of these requirements should be pretty 
straightforward -- there are really very few these days.  In Linux that is 
-- I can't comment the others, but Intel has recommended against using the 
PITs or the PICs as implemented by the PC/AT standard for some ten years 
now and "the others" follow these guidelines more closely it would seem.  
In particular for a "legacy-free" box I can't see any problem with leaving 
the firmware upon bootstrap with the APIC mode already set up.  Perhaps 
even in the protected mode.

 Well, that should normally be done using PCI configuration(!) space (it's 
been invented for that purpose after all) of host bridges.  Some tasks may 
require poking at I2C mapped somewhere, but the space for that device may 
be properly handled with BARs.  Or it can be system-specific and disabled 
after initial setup -- I've seen systems with a minimal I2C controller 
wired directly to the CPU bus and a full-blown one available in a south 
bridge with the former being able to be disabled once unneeded.

 One chip less?  Well, perhaps the cost of R&D for such a system would 
exceed the total cost of keeping that chip included in all boards 
manufactured during the term corporate planning is able to cover....
