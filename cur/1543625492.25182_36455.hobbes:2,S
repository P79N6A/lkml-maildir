Hi ,
  Sorry for posting this to wrong list. But you can help me out.
I am porting some code from Vxworks to Linux (application level, not
kernel). 
THe problem is , in Vxworks as there is a single address space so a 'malloc'
done by one process is visible to other process also, i.e. all the global
data is shared in Vxworks across processes.
This is not true in linux, as every process has its own address space. 
What could be done so that I can use same 'malloc' like interface and have
all my 'global data'
shared across process. 
I can understand that i have to use shared memory for this. Is there any
library available
that provides me a 'malloc' type interface for shared memory.
All processes are unrelated processes ( fork -> exec)
Thanks
Amol
