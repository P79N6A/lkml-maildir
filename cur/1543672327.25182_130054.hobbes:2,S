   Can't think of anything very clever there, except to go and un-percpuify the
   disk stats.  I think that's best, really - disk requests only come in at 100
   to 200 per second - atomic_t's or int-plus-per-disk-spinlock will be fine.
Use some spinlock we already have to be holding during the
counter bumps.
Frankly, these things don't need to be %100 accurate.  Using
a new spinlock or an atomic_t for this seems rediculious.
