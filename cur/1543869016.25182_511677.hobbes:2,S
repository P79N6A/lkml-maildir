Okay, this one is even more plainly "not a coding error".

The code around this point (with the return point marked) is:
> c01c0f78:	6a 05                	push   $0x5
> c01c0f7a:	53                   	push   %ebx
> c01c0f7b:	e8 f0 ea ff ff       	call   c01bfa70 <serial_in>
> c01c0f80:	6a 00                	push   $0x0
> c01c0f82:	53                   	push   %ebx
> c01c0f83:	e8 e8 ea ff ff       	call   c01bfa70 <serial_in>
> c01c0f88<<<	6a 02                	push   $0x2
> c01c0f8a:	53                   	push   %ebx
> c01c0f8b:	e8 e0 ea ff ff       	call   c01bfa70 <serial_in>
and corresponds with this C code:
        (void) serial_inp(up, UART_LSR);
        (void) serial_inp(up, UART_RX);
        (void) serial_inp(up, UART_IIR);
Now let's look at the words pushed on the stack around this code:
  00000000
  00000000
  c01c0f88 <- return address for serial_in (serial8250_startup+0x28f/0x2a9)
  00000000 <- from push %ebx at c01c0f82
  00000000 <- from push $0x0 at c01c0f80
  c031fef0 <- from push %ebx at c01c0f7a
  00000005 <- from push %0x5 at c01c0f78
Plainly, %ebx changed across the call to serial_in() at c01c0f7b.
First thing to notice is this violates the C code - "up" can not
change.
Now let's look at serial_in:
c01bfa70:       55                      push   %ebp
c01bfa71:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
c01bfa73:       53                      push   %ebx
...
c01bfab7:       5b                      pop    %ebx
c01bfab8:       5d                      pop    %ebp
c01bfab9:       c3                      ret
This code tells the CPU to preserves %ebx and %ebp.  But we know %ebx
_wasn't_ preserved.  Ergo, your CPU is plainly not doing what the code
told it to do.
Moreover, serial_in() has preserved %ebx in the past otherwise we'd
never got past all the other serial_in()s in serial8250_startup().
So I think it's very demonstrably a hardware fault, and not software
related.
For all we know, it could be a one-off fault on the hardware you
happen to have - other identical units may not behave the same (can
you check?)
If it is a one off case, you are welcome to patch that test out in
your kernel build to remove the problem, and if it's an isolated case
I encourage you to do this.  This is one of the great advantages of
open source - if you hit such a problem rather than throwing the
hardware away you can work around such issues.
