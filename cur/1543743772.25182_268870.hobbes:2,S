that looks weird, why that? The oom killer must be robust against a task
not going anyway regardless of this (task can be stuck in nfs or
similar). If a fail path ever existed, __GFP_NOFAIL should not have been
used in the first place. I don't see many valid excuses to use
__GFP_NOFAIL if we can return NULL without the caller running into an
infinite loop.
btw, PF_MEMDIE has always been racy in the way it's being set, so it can
corrupt the p->flags, but the race window is very small to trigger it
(and even if it triggers, it probably wouldn't be fatal). That's why I
don't use PF_MEMDIE in 2.4-aa.
