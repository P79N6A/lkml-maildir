Timing the memory accesses will probably detect things like that, as
PCI/AGP tend to be slower than ordinary memory. We could get
a warning about slow ram at least, this would also warn about those
motherboards that don't cache everything.

This test only mess with memory that would be mapped by the kernel
anyway, so
nothing to worry about.  Getting a crash during boot is certainly better
than
mysterious corruption some time later. 
Also note that a non-destructive test is possible.  The commodore 64 had
that.
It tested by reading a byte, invert and write it back, test, invert and
write
back again.  This preserves data in all cases (except if the test
routine
tests its own instruction memory, as I discovered :-).  And it cannot be
fooled by the uncommon but possible scenario of ROM that happens to
contain the exact test pattern you use.
