To be honnest, before reading this thread, I would have voted for the
sizeof(*p). However, I completely agree that there is a high risk of
messing up the initialization, and that structures don't change often.
The situations where I think that sizeof(*p) is better than
sizeof(struct foo) is more on functions such as memset() than {,k}malloc() :
forgetting to initialize a struct member is always a high risk, but if the
object is not a struct (eg, a scalar), then it could be tolerated. I don't
know anybody who does kmalloc(sizeof(int)) nor kmalloc(sizeof(char)), but
with memset, it's different. Doing memset(p, 0, sizeof(*p)) seems better
to me than memset(p, 0, sizeof(short)), and represents a smaller risk
when 'p' will silently evolve to a long int.
Last, there's little probability that a scalar will evolve into a struct
without code modifications, while it has happened often that a __u8 or
__u16 was changed to __u32. So perhaps we could accept use of sizeof(*p)
when (*p) is a scalar to protect against silent type changes, and reject
it when (*p) is a structure to avoid incomplete initialization ?
Alan, I like your proposal BTW ;-)

Willy
