if it only happens while or after running Amanda, it may be a tape
driver bug.

the oopses shows some inode was corrupted, it doesn't tell us who is
corrupting them but most likely it is not a piece of common code (a driver
or a non mainstream feature or we should be able to reproduce it) You
should try to localize the bug to a piece of code, by for example making
100% sure that it triggers as soon as you start amanda. Then you can try
to backup using another device (not tape) and see if you can still
reproduce. finally you can try to use older or newer 2.4 drivers for the
tape and see if there's any change that fixes the problem in the old/new
drivers. Of course it isn't certain at all that it is the tape, I'm just
guessing because you said it happens while backing up to the tape.
