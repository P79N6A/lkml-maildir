Well I do have a similar Problem with LVD Scsi drives (IBM DDRS)
connected to an 7890 Adaptec U2W controller (on board on Asus P2Bs);
Intel Pentium II 400MHz, 128MB RAM. Running kernel 2.2.5-22.
I suspected bad memory, so I changed it with a (similarily working)
module from another machine, but no avail. 
I suspected a cable problem so I checked it. 
I suspected the attached scanner and disconnected it, but no avail.
I suspected a low power supply and took 2 drives off, but no avail.
Symptoms: 
---------	
The message occurs only when doing backup on tape (the only heavy IO
situation for that machine). 
Oct 27 02:00:21 iwr01 kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Oct 27 02:00:21 iwr01 kernel: 08:11: rw=0, want=2078145526, limit=8924076 
                              ^^^^^
The device numbers corresponds to /dev/sda11 but this partition did
never exist, fdisk shows correct values.
An e2fsck is needed to fix the filesystem, but things will come back some
days later.
I am a little helpless on this topic, (I will replace the whole
machine but the disks soon, just to be sure of no hardware defects).
What can I do to track the problem down?
Regards,
	Martin.
