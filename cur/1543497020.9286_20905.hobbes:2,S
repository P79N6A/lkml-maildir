Linux modules are in the same address space as the kernel.  In a
micro-kernel ``modules'' are in their own address space.  This is
why micro-kernels are slower than traditional kernels.
It is because of this slowness that micro-kernels are sometimes very
large, as in the case of NT.  To speed up a micro-kernel you put the
more important parts into the kernel proper.
