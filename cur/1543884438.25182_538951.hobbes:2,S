Huge amounts of complexity? It just _moves_ some futex code around!
The intended use is not for locking, but for event signaling. Why can't
it be future-safe? It just needs a address and a value! Pseudocode:
thread A:
    int fd = plfutex(addr, 0);
    do
        poll(fdset+fd);
        process network events
        queue obj to thread B
        if fd:
            job processed
thread B:
    wait_job();
    process_job();
    raise_event(addr);

It simple as is, there is no need to overdesign.
