Well, I don't know what exactly caused slabp->inuse (could be cachep->num 
too, although sounds unlikely) to corrupt for Michael. But yeah, freeing 
an object twice obviously corrupts slabp->inuse too.

I don't think cachep->name is enough to debug the problem and as soon as 
you turn on CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG double-frees should show up in 
verify_redzone_free with nice debugging info. So, I'd prefer we keep the 
simple BUG_ON and simply ask people to turn on debugging if they hit it.
