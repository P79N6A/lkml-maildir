Iam not attached to the API change, so disassociating the node from cpu is ok.
It just feels a bit weird to say node is not online. 
Probably ACPI doesnt give a precise way to put the dependencies (in a certain
order), there are EDL/EJD, but they have limitations and not directly imply
a dependency like this. But container code having to deal with this dependency
for add/remove is probably ok. 
i hope container would eventually perform onlining the pieces from user space
scripts via udev like mechanisms.
I remember folks from SGI posting patches to cpu only nodes in the past. 
Same way there are probably IO only nodes. Are you sure we cover these cases 
as well.
