The problem with doing this project is to create an identically
functioning system that's correct. The current track taking by Monta Vista
is highly unstable given the lack of locking throughout their kernel. It
has all of the complexities of mutex style conventions without any debugging
methodology attached to it. It's no longer the spinlock universe that
Linux is using since a deadlock situation just leaves use running in
cpu_idle wondering what is going on.
It's something that needs to be address in the large scheme of the project.

This has been articulate a couple of times by both me and Ingo (recent email).
The MV's system is highly unstable, not because of priority inheritance,
but because of basic lock violation in the lock graph itself. It's another kind
of SMP granularity problem. The hard problem was just what Ingo was saying and
it's higher, but higher in the graph.

Yeah, it needs to be done. I like the "_" methodology that both Monta Vista
and Ingo are using. I'll convert my stuff over to using it when I'm finished
with a couple of large items here.

This is kind of a sketchy problem. So far all of what I've seen really needs
to be done manually and can be done using the all of the normal Linux locking
and scheduler/interrupt masking primitives. I'd hate to see another system
added to this that solves a problem that may not exist. Please, correct
me if I'm not understanding you.
