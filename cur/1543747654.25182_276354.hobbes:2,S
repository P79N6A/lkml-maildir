Btw, how the min_free_kbytes works?
I have up to 1MB TCP windows. If I'm running out of memory then kswapd should
try to free some memory (or bdflush). But on GE I can receive data faster then
disk is able to swap or flush buffers. So I should keep min_free big enough to
give time to disk to flush/swap data?
