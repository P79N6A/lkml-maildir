Subject: drivers/video/imsttfb.c: setclkMHz: clk_p is always 0

The Coverity checker noticed that in the function setclkMHz in 
drivers/video/imsttfb.c, the variable clk_p is never assigned a value 
other than 0.
Could someone understanding this code decide whether this is a real bug 
or whether clk_p can be replaced by 0?
TIA
