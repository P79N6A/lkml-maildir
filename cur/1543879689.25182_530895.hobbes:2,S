I did a quick test on a 64-bit kernel and did not see any problem with
the counters.  I'll ask the lab to set up a longer term test and monitor
the counters for bogus values.
I also like Andi's idea of using change_page_attr() to isolate the
problem.  I'll try to send you a debug patch in the next few days to try
that out.  Thanks.
