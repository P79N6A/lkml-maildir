I agree. In fact, we never left that.
Nothing is perfect.
In fact, a lot of engineering is _recognizing_ that you can never achieve
"perfect", and you're much better off not even trying - and having a
simple system that is "good enough".
This is the old adage of "perfect is the enemy of good" - trying too hard
is actually _detrimental_ in 99% of all cases. We should have simple
heuristics that work most of the time, instead of trying to cajole a
complex system like X to help us do some complicated resource management
system.
Complexity will just result in the OOM killer failing in surprising ways.
A simple heuristic will mean that the OOM killer will still fail, but at
least it won't be be in subtle and surprising ways.
