There are some okay parts to aa's hashing changes but we need to
work together to get the patch to perform those and drop the rest,
and also address some style issues. Some of the constants are
adjustable (though it's not clear how they should be adjusted) and the
wait_table_t ADT is fine. The hash function change is not and moving
the table from per-zone to per-node is questionable, as its effects are
not well-understood.
Perhaps understandably so, I'd like to take a hands-on role in
guiding this patch into a form suitable for the mainline kernel.

This looks like a change of invariants that could generate a fair
amount of audit work. Ugh...
Cheers,
