Heh, you said you wanted me to merge my stuff before yours :)

There might be some complaints.  But I doubt they would be from anyone
running a -mm tree as those people kind of know the current status of
things in the kernel.  There have been numerous warnings as to the fact
that this was going away, and I waited a _year_ to do this.
Also, no disto uses devfs only (gentoo is close, but offers users udev
and a static /dev also.)

Merging will fix these

Sounds like you can drop this :)

I'll handle these

Should be easy.

Not relevant :)

Again, shouldn't be that hard.
So there are probably 7 patches that need to get rediffed.  In your
normal merges, I can't see that being all that difficult :)
Or I can wait until you go next.  I didn't want these patches in the -mm
tree as they would have caused you too much work to keep up to date and
not conflict with anything else due to the size of them.
thanks,
