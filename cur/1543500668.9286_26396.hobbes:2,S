1)  On the PIII, there is the capability to get a system unique serial
number from the CPU.  Does Linux read this data already?  Is there plans to
read the serial number and then disable the capability (maybe so you could
get the serial number from the OS)?
2)  In the O'reilly book Linux Drivers there are several routines for
getting PCI interface information.  An attempt to try some of the example
code comes up with several routines as undefined.  pcibios_strerror() is
one, pcibios_find_device() is another, how do I get these functions defined?
