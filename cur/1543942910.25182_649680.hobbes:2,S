Again, I missed who wrote the above.  I'm reminded of Apple computer,
who explaining some engineering decisions in the Apple ][ pointed out
that an additional 10c in components adds $10 to the retail price (or
something rather like that.)   Cheap, cheap, cheap helps market share
far more than quality.
