On some ancient VAX version of Ultrix this was also possible in some cases.
It was useful mostly for creating headaches later on, like undeletable
directories, but unlink worked on directories too... Nice to have if you
managed to loose .. somewhere, though. Mandatory fsck(8) afterwards. If
this "feature" was removed later, it was probably just an oversight (aka
bug).  AFAIK, no Unix had other than the current reference counting garbage
collection anyway, without which this won't ever work.
