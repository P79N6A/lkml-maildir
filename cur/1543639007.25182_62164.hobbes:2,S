We have an optimisation where we store information in the linux pte that
lets us find the hashtable pte. If that one to one relationship is lost
we may need to search the primary and secondary group which could be
up to 16 hypervisor calls when running in logical partitioned mode.
We could start sharing hashtable ptes but thats going to require a fair
amount of work.
