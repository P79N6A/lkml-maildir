Take a moment to consider how you would supply a large number of ports
via this method - eg, 16 ports, where a port IO and IRQ configuration
takes about 10 characters ("0x1234,11"), and then what about the baud
base, probe flags (auto_irq, skip_test) ?
Also consider that ttyS0 might be your serial console for your headless
box, so you're unable to build 8250 as a module in the first place.
It really isn't simple.  Serial _is_ special - and that is why it keeps
sprouting new and wonderful initialisation paths.  I'd rather not add
yet another gods greatest invention initialisation path on top of those
we already have.

Actually, my example was slightly flawed - when the hardware turns up
it gets reset back to something sane.  So the settings are merely
remembered while the hardware doesn't exist.
