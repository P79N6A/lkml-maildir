You will get elapsed time, which is usually not the same as used cpu
time.

If you're timing/pofiling some user space functions, gprof should be
sufficient. If you want to profile kernel and module functions as
well, try oprofile at <
http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/>.
 It is part
of the kernel since 2.5.43.
