i seem to remember this being mentioned before, but couldn't find any
reference in the list archives. i have an x86 laptop running 2.2.17 (2.2.19
has the same effect) and an alpha pws 500 running 2.4.5-ac5. tcp starts slow
and get slower. it's not a 10/100 or duplex issue. icmp goes at full speed.
it doesn't matter which side starts the connection. has anyone else
experienced this? any suggestions?
