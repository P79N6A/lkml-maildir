There was a suggestion some time ago (yeah I know, that was RMS) to have
a special mode for "surprise-removal" filesystems: when starting a write
operation on the device, always complete it such as if unmounted by
surprise, the fs is still valid.
This is not quite like a journaled fs I think, because it ought to work
with any fs (e.g. vfat because most if not all removable
disks/floppies/CF/flash-card-du-jour are formatted like this).
Well, I think this should be looked at.
