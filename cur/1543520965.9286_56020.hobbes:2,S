Looks like you have keyboard emulation enabled in your BIOS. That'd
explain the e0 1e. It isn't handled by the USB drivers, but by the
pc_keyb.c driver.

Add it to pc_keyb.c tables if you really need it the few seconds during
boot. After boot the USB drivers take the keyboard control over, and no
more e0 1e's should happen.
