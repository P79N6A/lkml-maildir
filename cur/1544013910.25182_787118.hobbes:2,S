I can't find this, except possibly (but maybe not) at a cost from ieee,
and I'm not inclined to pay.  If you could post a sentence from this
annex it might help me to find it.

This confused me because the sense that I've got from this thread
suggests otherwise.  Unless I've misunderstood, the time() value for the
first second of 2009 is one greater than the value for the second to
last second of 2008 (i.e. 23:59:59), which means that there is no
translation for the last second.  Put another way, my understanding of
what's been said is that the epoch is effectively increased by one
second for each leap second.  Have I got this wrong?
