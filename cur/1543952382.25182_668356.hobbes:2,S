We still have two of them even placing hooks in each place manually.
Besides, putting the mem_cgroup_(un)charge_as() in these vm hooks will
1. save the number of places to patch
2. help keeping memcgroup consistent in case someone adds more places
   that expand tasks vm (arches, drivers) - in case we have our hooks
   celled from inside vm ones, we won't have to patch more.

This is a good point against. But, wrt my previous comment, can we handle 
this somehow?
