Yes, but in the meantime, the x86 tree would need this patch to make
kprobes work correctly on modules.
I suspect that without this fix, with the enhanced hotplug and kprobes
patch, kprobes will use text_poke to insert breakpoints in modules
(vmalloced pages used), which will map the wrong pages and corrupt
random kernel locations instead of updating the correct page.
Work that would write protect the module pages should clearly be done,
but it can come in a later time. We have to make sure we interact
correctly with the page allocation debugging, as an example.
Here is the patch against x86.git 2.6.25-rc5 :
The shadow vmap for DEBUG_RODATA kernel text modification uses virt_to_page to
get the pages from the pointer address.
However, I think vmalloc_to_page would be required in case the page is used for
modules.
Since only the core kernel text is marked read-only, use kernel_text_address()
to make sure we only shadow map the core kernel text, not modules.
