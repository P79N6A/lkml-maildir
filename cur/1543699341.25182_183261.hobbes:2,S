IMHO (and IANAL of course), it seems a bit tenuous to me the argument 
that just because you deliberating break compatibility at the module 
level on a regular basis, that they are automatically derived works. 
Clearly the module interfaces could be stabilised and published, and if 
you consider the instance of a single kernel version in time, that module 
ABI *is* published and *is* stable *for that version*. Just because you 
make an active effort to change things and actively *not* document the 
ABI other than in the source code across kernel versions, doesn't 
automatically make a module a derived work. 
IMHO anyway.
