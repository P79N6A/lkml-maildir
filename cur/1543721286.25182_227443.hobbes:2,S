1. You press the key (on an AT keyboard)
2. The keyboard hardware makes an interrupt
3. The interrupt acitvates the i8042 driver (in 2.6)
   which does the port 0x60 stuff.  
4. From there, the key is propagated through tty and
   console and ends up in your application.  This application
   might be X, which passes the key onto some program using X.
