I'm sure it's something messed up on my machine, but I'm curious what would
cause this.
Ok, menuconfig comes up on all systems (except mine) with a nice blue
background title 'Linux Kernel ...' in cyan.  The hotkeys (I guess that's
what they are) in the menu is Yellow and the window title is also yellow.
My system (As I said, I'm sure it's my system since my other 3 don't look
the same.  And on this system it only happens at the console, not in X) at
the console menuconfig comes with with a red background, yellow 'Linux
Kernel ...' At the top, and the window title/hotkeys are cyan.
If you're going to ask kernel version, nope, 2 machines (this and another)
use the same version and they are different at the console.
Doesn't seem to be anything to do with compiling since I used the same tree
throughout the entire tests (nfs).  I even left it comiled the last time and
tried it on another machine (not the one in red) and it comes up in blue.
I'm just curious if anyone's seen this before and what libs or whatever
could cause it (console only, X is fine)
