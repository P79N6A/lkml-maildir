it *is* the right moment to clean these issues up. These kinds of things
are what made the 2.2 VM a mess (everybody added his easy improvements,
without solving some of the conceptual problems), and frankly, instead of
yet another elevator algorithm we need a squeaky clean VM balancer above
all. Please help identifying, fixing, debugging and testing these VM
balancing issues. This is tough work and it needs to be done.
