The concern is this isn't just compatible = "..8641.." "..8548.." but  
something like:
"..8641.." "..8641d.." "..8548.." "..8548e.." "..8543.." "..8543e.."  
"..8572.." "..8572e.." "..8567.." "..8567e.." "..8568.." "..8568e.."

While I agree concrete names are good, we put these 'blocks' in so  
many devices that using the device to match on is pointless.
I'm all for making up a name like 'Grande', 'Del', 'Janeiro'.  This  
is effective what we did with gianfar.  The name gets picked up  
pretty quickly by people.
