Maciej, it *is* the right fix. These are UP systems not SMP systems, but
if we boot an SMP kernel then we find a (largely bogus) mptable during the
scan.
Any BIOS of a real SMP box that is so blatantly broken to specify a NULL
ioapic in the mptable deserves SMP mode being disabled altogether.
lets not overcomplicate things.
