Vagaries of 'cut' aside you can limit yourself here to just shell:
set_name_period () {
   NAME=$1 ; PERIOD=$2
}
for i in "MSEC 1000" "USEC 1000000"
do
   set_name_period $i
....
done
or you may skip a shell function and do 'set $i' within a loop plus
assignments of $1 and $2 to NAME and PERIOD but that overwrites original
positional parameters (which may be already not important).
