Hi,
We have been using this in production for some time, with all the 2.4
kernels since 2.4.17 and it has been stable.  Our version is at
http://www.hardrock.org/kernel/2.4.20
You will have to follow the patch-order file and make sure to apply the ext3
patch first as it will be required to use the LVM patch.
BTW, we are still using LVM version 1.0.5.

James Bourne
