Subject: [PATCH] fix current BK tree compilation with devfs enabled
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Not that I care for devfs, but there was at least one report on lkml.
I tried to also put the devfs_handle_t under CONFIG_DEVFS_FS, but the
devfs wrappers require it.  And yes, I'm seriously pissed that devfs
puts wordsize objects everywhere even if not enabled.
