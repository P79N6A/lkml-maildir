Effecting all tasks matching a uid or some other filter is a little
beyond what either patch does.  Note however that both interfaces have
atomicity.
You can open and write to proc from within a program ... very easily, in
fact.
Also, with some sed and grep magic, you can set the affinity of all
tasks via the proc interface pretty easy.  Just a couple lines.
