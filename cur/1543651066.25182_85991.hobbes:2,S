That got stamped out.  swapon will fail if the file isn't fully
instantiated on disk:
static int setup_swap_extents(struct swap_info_struct *sis)
{
	...
                        block = bmap(inode, probe_block + block_in_page);
                        if (block == 0)
                                goto bad_bmap;
	...
bad_bmap:
        printk(KERN_ERR "swapon: swapfile has holes\n");
        ret = -EINVAL;
}
