The input api PS/2 mouse driver is meant to replace the old driver which
is in pc_keyb.c. Unfortunely most keyboard drivers are based around
pc_keyb.c so it has to stay for now. Plus the console system is designed
around pc_keyb.c. This will also change as the console system is migrated
toward the input api. So to any keyboard maintainers please port your
drivers over to the input api before they break when the console system
breaks.
