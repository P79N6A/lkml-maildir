IBM has an OpenSource volume manager called evms, and although
it does support AIX Volumes is has it's root in IBM's OS/2
volume management system.  (I believe someone at IBM thinks of PCs
when hearing Linux so all their ports start from OS/2...)

The current code is from Heinz Maulshagen and now matained by Sistina,
the company he works for.

ALthough the current LVM has its's issues I hope not so - the current
EVMS is the best example on hhow to not write kernel subsystems.
