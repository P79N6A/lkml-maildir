there are still 4 keys (f-keys with f-lock active) which i can't map to 'free' 
keycodes: no matter which value i assign with sk, they always get mapped to 
already mapped keys which causes them to collide (e.g. f-lock+f3 always gets 
mapped to keycode 108 which is already assigned to 'enter' on the numpad)
note that those collisions happen inside x (4.3). writing this, i recognize 
that this is probably more of a x-problem. anyhow, maybe someone with the 
same problems or even solutions is followig this thread ;)
keep on rockin'
