True - the seek activity is another critical resource that would need to
be throttled to keep updatedb/backup from interferring with my late
night labours.
Let's see, that's:
 1) cpu scheduling ticks
 2) memory for virtual address backing store
 3) memory for file related caching
 4) disk arm motion
Hmmm ... actually not so much a numa-placement extension, but rather a
CKRM opportunity.
CKRM focuses on measuring and restraining how much of specified critical
resources a task is using; numa placement on which cpus or memory nodes
are allowed to be used at all.
See further the CKRM thread of Shailabh Nagar, also running on lkml
today.
