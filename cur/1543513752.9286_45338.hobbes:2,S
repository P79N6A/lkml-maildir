It is getting colder here now (even though summer is supposed to be getting
nearer), so that isn't an explanation. Besides, the machine does work fine
with other kernels, no unexplained SIG11's. Just a reproducible (very!)
eating of filesystems with certain kernels. Might be the kernel's fault, or
the compiler's. Not the machine's anyway.
