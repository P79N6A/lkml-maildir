Subject: [OFFTOPIC] Where to get Alpha information
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'd like to get some URL's, etc of where I can obtain used/new
Alpha CPU's, motherboards, memory, etc...  primarily low end
stuff, PCI motherboards, etc...  Ones that are capable of running
Linux.
I'd also like links to sites that discuss Linux on the Alpha,
what to expect, trials and tribulations, and other useful help.
Are there any specific things to stay away from?
Does anyone have an old Alpha that they're not using that they'd
care to donate to someone who is wanting to learn Alpha
architecture?
If you can help with any of these things please reply.
Thanks in advance.
TTYL
