I thought the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL had a role in rights _management_ insofar as it
would shows that anyone circumventing it took a conscious act to do so. This may
or may not be valuable in subsequent, possibly legal, discussions.
It's not a rights _enforcement_ scheme on it's own (presumably enforcement
would ultimately involve men with big sticks - aka the legal system). It simply
helps manage (GPL) rights.
