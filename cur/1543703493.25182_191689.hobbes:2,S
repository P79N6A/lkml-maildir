Actually, it's *not* "bound to happen".  Figure out the number of blocks you'd
need to have even a 1% chance of a birthday collision in a 2**128 space.
And you'd need that many disk blocks on *a single system*.
Then figure out the chances of a collision on a small machine that only has 20
or 30 terabytes (yes, in this case terabytes is small).
The whole reason "use MD5 as a check for identical blocks" is useful is because
the chances of *that* going wrong are vanishingly small compared to the chances
that a memory stick will throw an undetected multiple-bit error, or that a RAID
controller will write blocks to the wrong disks, or any number of other things
that *do* happen in real life, but rarely enough that we don't bother writing
code to defend against them.
