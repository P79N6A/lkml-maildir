I'm not 100% sure on the samba side, but I think there is a pretty
significant difference. On the Mac, the problem of copying forks and
metadata onto non-Mac systems was recognized early on. There are several
standard formats for serialized versions of this data. If you take the
files that netatalk writes and copy them directly to a Mac separately,
there are tools that can convert them back to the original format with
all the data intact. I've never seen such a thing for NTFS named streams.
