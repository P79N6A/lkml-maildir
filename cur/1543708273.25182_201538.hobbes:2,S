Could it be that the lower zone protection stuff simply means
that Chris's system only ever allocates page cache and anonymous
memory from his 600 MB highmem, leaving the 900 MB lowmem for
the slab cache to roam freely ?
I guess highmem allocations really should put some pressure on
lowmem, even when there is enough lowmem free, because otherwise
you end up effectively not using half of the memory on 1.5-2 GB
systems for paging ...
