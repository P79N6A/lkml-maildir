Unfortunately not the whole story. The permissions are checked at open
time not on read/write/ioctl so once I have the device opened you
lose. That means you may have to fix the permissions and ownership
before trying to unload the device. The unload will fail if it is still
busy but if not then nobody will be able to open the dev node and
whatever file it now points to.
