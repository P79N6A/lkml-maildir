Count me in.
However, while this is much better than a compile-time setting, it's still
not fully satisfying since many users won't realize that they're hitting this
problem and thus won't search for and find this obscure boot parameter.
Is there any way at all to get this condition detected automatically?
I think one should try hard to find a way to detect it, if at all possible.
