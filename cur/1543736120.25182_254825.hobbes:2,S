OK, I inserted a printk between each line of acpi_power_off, I see
set_cpus_allowed finished and then the pause, then after ~30s the
poweroff, I never get to see the remaining printk.

Could you give a more precise instructions, I really know nothing about
kernel programming.
And I found something else, this only occurs when I have my usb mouse
plugged in. If there is no mouse plugged in, suspending  works and the 3
lines after "Freeing memory..." are not printed.
However, after resume I still need to remove and reinsert ohci_hcd
module to have usb work again, just like in 2.6.8.

I don't know how I tested it before, but the network works after
resuming if I remove the module and reinsert it.

This did nothing.
By the way, is there a swsusp specific list?
