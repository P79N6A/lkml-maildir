FWIW Al Viro pointed out to me yesterday that block_xxx are really
nothing but helpers...  Depending on them doing or not doing certain
things is IMHO ok... 
If the behavior of the helpers is not what is desired, you are free to
ignore them and roll your own... or wrap them as it appears ext3 is
doing here.
