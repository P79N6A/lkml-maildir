Well, I was not talking about Audio - I was saying that there are a class of
applications which need low latency on commits (fsync or rename).
And for the audio mixer, the problem is that you have multiple reschedules
and data ping pong if you do user mode mixing - i guess.
Anyway.. not important. I still think filesystem servers can be a good
thing. And I really hope we will find some interesting numbers on ZFS
advantages...
