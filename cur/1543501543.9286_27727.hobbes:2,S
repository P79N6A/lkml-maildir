Hi,
Just a summary reply because I don't have time to reply to everyone.
1. For everyone who complained about a few unrelated offhand comments
about Novell or who misinterpreted what I said about support.  These
aren't kernel issues -- feel free to ask me off the list if you really
care that much, and I offer my apologies for offending you.
2. Actually, the example system I mentioned isn't a single computer.  It
is a geographically distributed VMS cluster using a combination of
software and hardware RAID to keep the copies of data in sync.  This
doesn't change the fact that if one of those systems is writing data and
gets nuked, and the filesystem is ext2, the disk may not be consistent and
the drive would need to be checked before the other cluster nodes could
effectively resume operation.  There will certainly be a system there to
take the work load, but it can't do anything until it knows the data is
there and safe.
3. Yes, businesses care about losses in the millions of dollars.  Period.
If this percentage analysis were right on, companies would not spend so
much effort to get that last thousandth of a percentage point of uptime.
They do, and that proves that they care.
4. I'm going to stop arguing now.  It will always be possible to argue
away the need for good design.  Thank God that hasn't stopped people from
expending energy and coming up with good designs in the past, and it won't
in the future.
Chris Smith
