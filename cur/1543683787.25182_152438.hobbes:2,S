No luck. I compiled all mouse drivers as modules and tried
modprobe mousedev
modprobe psmouse
gpm -m /dev/misc/psaux (or the /dev/input devices) -t ps/2
Same 'Lost synchronization' messages and the crazy (optical)
mouse. No keys pressed, it moves very fast if you move if
slightly, pastes text, executes any gpm -S commands, and on
XFree86 opens rxvt etc.
