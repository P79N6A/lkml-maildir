  This is a fallback if HAL isn't available.  Normally this is done by:
drive->max_speed_write = libhal_device_get_property_int
                                (ctx, device_names [i],
                                 "storage.cdrom.write_speed",
                                 NULL)
                                / CD_ROM_SPEED;
 (natilus-burn-drive.c:1368 from version 2.12.0).

  Yeah, sure.
                  /* FIXME we don't have any way to guess the real device
                   * from the info we get from CDRecord */
 (the only FIXME in above mentioned file).
