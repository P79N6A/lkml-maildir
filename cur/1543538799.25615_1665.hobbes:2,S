I would think - from reading the manpage - that it should return EBADF
from the test program Bjarne posted. I tried this on HPUX, and as he says,
it does not segfault there. 
The manpage says:
ERRORS
       EBADF  The argument stream is not an open stream.
I do not know a lot about the Linux file system, but I found this in 
fs/open.c:
/*
 * Careful here! We test whether the file pointer is NULL before
 * releasing the fd. This ensures that one clone task can't release
 * an fd while another clone is opening it.
 */
asmlinkage int sys_close(unsigned int fd)
{
        int error;
        struct file * filp;
        lock_kernel();
        error = -EBADF;
        filp = fcheck(fd);
        if (filp) {
                struct files_struct * files = current->files;
                files->fd[fd] = NULL;
                put_unused_fd(fd);
                FD_CLR(fd, files->close_on_exec);
                error = filp_close(filp, files);
        }
        unlock_kernel();
        return error;
}
I do not know how it get the relation between fd and the call to
fclose. Could this be a glibc-on-linux thing? In what cases would one
expect it to return EBADF if not in this?

You know you're a Linux geek when...
    You find the thought of rebooting after installing a piece of software
    utterly absurd.
