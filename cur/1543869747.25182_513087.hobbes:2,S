ramfs is just the easiest way to measure the pure CPU overhead of a 
workload without real IO delays (and resulting idle time) getting in the 
way. It's certainly not the same thing, but still it's pretty useful 
most of the time. I used a different method, loopback block device, and 
got similar results. [ Real IO shows similar results as well, but is a 
lot more noisy and hence harder to interpret (and thus easier to get 
wrong). ]
