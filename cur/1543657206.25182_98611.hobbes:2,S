Wouldn't it be straightforward to package that IOMMU solution using the
"call dev->whatsit->dma_op()" approach I mentioned?  Storing data in
the "whatsit" seems more practical than saying driver_data is no longer
available to the device's driver.  (I'll be agnostic on platform_data.)
This problem seems to me to be a common layering requirement.  All the
indirections are known when the device structure is being initted, so it
might as well be set up then.  True for PARISC (right?), as well as USB,
SCSI, and most other driver stacks.  I suspect it'd even allow complex
voodoo for multi-path I/O too...
