Does anyone actually have a handle on what's involved in fixing the
inheritance problem?
It's risky, but it is something which we should do.
<grumpytroll> We really shouldn't have merged all that new fancy security

Especially as the new stuff seems incapable of doing simple things which
unbroken inherited caps would do perfectly.</grumpytroll>
