People often tab the \ characters across to the right, make them line up
nicely.  It does look better.

So it is a macro instead of a static inline because we need to emit an
entry into __cond_call_strings once per callsite, yes?

I suspect this is underparenthesised.

I'm not really able to review this material very usefully without having
seen an overall description of what it all does and how it all works.
What happens here when the text section is marked read-only, and when
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is in use?
