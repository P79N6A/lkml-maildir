I'd discount this as it made no difference to run it at half speed in 
a bios setting, making a 1400 out of this 2800 athlon at the same 
time the bios signed the ram on as DDR200 dual channel ram.

I think now that this is the scenario in effect.  The next time it 
Oops's, I'll spend some time and reseat both sticks several more 
times.  As this vendor is in Tampa FL, could the storage environment 
there for new mainbooards in their retail packaging box be a factor?  
With the turnover rate Dan has, I wouldn't think so, but then I've 
NDI where they may sit between their assembly in .tw land, and going 
on his shelves in Tampa.  The retail box from Biostar has the board 
in the usual pink bubble-wrap static bag. but it isn't sealed other 
than the end folded over and taped shut.  Ditto for the ram but I 
think thats hand packed per order in the usual grey anti-static, way 
too big, bag.
Right now, memburn hasn't errored again, but konstruct bailed out 
trying to make liboggvorbis, and there is over 830 megs in swap.  I 
should be able to do a swapoff and restart, leaving X/kde, memburn 
and seti running I'd think.  I'll send this and check a swapoff for 
grins.  All this used to run in 512 megs without useing any great 
amount of swap.  :-]
