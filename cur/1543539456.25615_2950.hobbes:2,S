Do you an atomic update for these 32 bytes, or is it acceptable if the
second cpu sees the old bytes 0..7, 12..31, and the updated bytes 8..11?
A write to one aligned int or long variable is atomic (*), but you
shouldn't make assumptions about the order between multiple int/long
writes.
If you need an atomic update, then you definitively need a lock.
And: do you need a synchroneous update? 
I mean: cpu1 is near the audit point, and cpu2 changes the audit mask.
Do you have to guarantee that if cpu1 is before the audit point, and
cpu2 has returned from the "change_audit" function, that then cpu1 will
see the new audit mask?
All fast cpu queue memory writes, so the window is at least several
dozend cpu ticks even on i386, and on NUMA it could be huge.

If you want to align a structure, then use
struct my_struct {
	int my_val;
} __attribute__ ((__aligned__(SMP_CACHE_BYTES)));

You could also use a big reader spinlock, see
linux/include/linux/brlock.h.

256 bits?

4*32 == 256?
