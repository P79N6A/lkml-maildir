Hmm. It does for me, actually.
I fixed up the trivial conflict in the main Makefile, but that seems to 
leave $(ARCH) entirely undefined in my case, so the end result doesn't 
work. That seems to have nothing to do with my conflict fixup, but is 
something else.
It also gets a trivial conflict with the 'mmc' pull I just did, but that 
didn't seem problematic (mmc added a new case to scripts/mod/file2alias.c, 
and you added a free, both at the end of the same function) - but the x86 
merge conflict means that I decided that I'll let you sort it out. It's 
probably really trivial, but I'll merge the other stuff I have pending 
instead.
