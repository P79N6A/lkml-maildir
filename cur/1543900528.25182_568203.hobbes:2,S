one note is that the "talk differently to hardware" thing is in part
already tested with the 32 bit tickless code; a lot of people (80% ?)
are still using the 32 bit OS on their 64 bit machines, and the 32 bit
code already talks in the "new way" to this hardware.... 
(and since Fedora 7 already ships tickless for 32 bit there are quite a
lot of people using that in practice, in addition to the kernel.org
kernel users)
I would expect just about all the hardware interaction issues to have
popped up already because of this "run 32 bit on 64 bit hardware" thing.
