We seem to have some general problem with mkfs for all filesystems.
I am seeing this across at least three test systems although
most are unable to compile this kernel :(, even with the hotfix.
Basically, all mkfs operations for any filsystem type are failing,
ext2 reports this as "short write", various others are mentioning
pwrite and pwrite64 returning bad things:
ext2: Could not write 8 blocks in inode table starting at 851970:
	Attempt to write block from filesystem resulted in short
	write
reiserfs: bwrite: write 4096 bytes returned -1 (block=851968,
	dev=3): No space left on device
xfs: mkfs.xfs: pwrite64 failed: No space left on device
Nothing is reported in dmesg at the time as far as I can tell.  From the
ext2 log I would swear we get this error on a block number far below that
which is reported written successfully, though I cannot say I trust mkfs.
Nothing obvious has changed pwrite or block/* to my eye, so heck knows
where this is coming from.  2.6.24-rc2 works on these same systems as
goes the latest 2.6.24-rc2-git5.
Full mkfs output below.
