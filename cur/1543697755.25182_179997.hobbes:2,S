A forced fsck of all my file-systems seems to have cured this. At least its 
not easy to trigger anymore (not even in test9).
I looked something really had gone wrong sometime. I got multiple filesystems
with errors on it (without it had been noticed; all had to have a forced fsck 
not a "normal" one).
But, so far so good.
