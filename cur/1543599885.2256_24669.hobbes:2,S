Hi,
Here is the bug :
Scheduling in interrupt
kernel BUG at sched.c:706!
< all the registers are dump >
Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
General information :
Kernel version : 2.4.8 without SMP
GCC version : 2.96-81 (Red Hat 7.1)
I am developing in the kernel. I got two PC with one network card for each.
The bug appear when trying to stress my network driver by sending a lot
of packet to one node on the network. The PC that is sending packets
seems to work fine, but the one that receiving packets get the bug after 
a while. My interrupt handler does not have bottom half and my interrupt
as the options : SA_INTERRUPT and SA_SHIRQ.
I got two possible answer. The first possible answer to this is my interrupt
routine stays too long at the interrupt level. The second answer is I lock
the
interrupt for a long time.
Do you have any suggestion to this problem ?
Thanks,
Jean-Francois Hammond
