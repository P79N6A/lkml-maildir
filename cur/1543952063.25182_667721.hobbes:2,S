Hi Arjan,
Thanks for your response. 
Sorry for the long post, I think the issue required a lot of detail. I'm
sure that it was easy to overlook that this is still an issue in a 6
week old kernel:

It looks like from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/
 that .16
is the longest-running subversion and is still being maintained. Is
there a better list for 2.6.16 issues?
I am testing 2.6.24.3 now. I am not going tickless. I am not using PIT
with any of the kernels I am testing.
Thanks,
Joel.
