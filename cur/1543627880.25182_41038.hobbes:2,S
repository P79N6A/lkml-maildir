The tables are almost sorted already.  It is just the occasional entry
that is out of order, e.g.
foo.o
  .text uses copy_to_user
  .text.init uses copy_to_user
bar.o
  .text users copy_to_user
baz.o
  .text users copy_to_user
Only the .text.init exception entry will be out of order, it will
require two passes over the table to sort it.  In the simplest case
there will be no out of order entries and one pass does the job.  The
number of out of order entries is a function of how much init and exit
code does special processing, not a lot.
