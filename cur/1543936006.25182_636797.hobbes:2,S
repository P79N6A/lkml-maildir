Stepping back, the biggest part of the problem is that I replaced the
ACPI motherboard driver, which reserved all resources, with the PNP
motherboard driver, which currently can reserve only a limited number
of resources, because I didn't realize that restriction.
So we've had a variety of problems, and we've tried to address them
with hacks like increasing the PNP limits.  I think we need to put
back the ACPI motherboard driver until we have dynamic PNP resources.
We will also need an it87 change to deal with
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9514.
I'll work these up and post them soon.
