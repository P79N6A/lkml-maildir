I am looking into this, but I do not have this problem (which is odd).
The patch wraps one define of atomic_dec_and_lock in an #ifndef
CONFIG_PREEMPT, but I assume there is another defination elsewhere.  For
whatever reason, my kernel compiles fine.
I am going to update the patch to 2.4.9-ac2, give that a try.
Wait a second...you are _ENABLING_ the configure option, right?  Always
run `make oldconfig' !!!  If you are not, in this case, the patch is
breaking compiles where CONFIG_PREEMPT is not set...now I can fix that.
Please let me know.
