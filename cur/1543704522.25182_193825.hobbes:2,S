Ok i tried the configuration you sent, and after working out that you have a 
different motherboard chipset which caused the kernel to hang here whenever i 
did anything that involved the hard disk (copy the drivers from my backup 
partition to my work partition for instance - to ensure that i was using 
"good copies") i even had signs of success.
Mere signs though. I continue being told it's an invalid format:
FATAL: Error inserting nvidia (/lib/modules/2.6.1/kernel/drivers/video/
nvidia.ko): Invalid module format
So ... i'm out of ideas ... i don't get why it ain't doing for me what it is 
doing for everyone else. I am wondering IF something screwed up when i 
upgraded Slackware 9.1 from 9.0 ... and in the interest of testing that 
theory might do a rm -f / later and start from scratch. I haven't decided if 
2.6 is worth that much yet though.
