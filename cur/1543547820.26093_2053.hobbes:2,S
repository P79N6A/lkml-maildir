Yes, I can say first hand that this is very useful advice.  
VMware is a wonderful aid for this purpose.  However, it is not
an all in one solution.  VMware gets an artificial emulated look
at the hardware, so your guest OS (Linux) will NOT see that you
have a Ultra100 or a whizbang2000 SCSI card.  Regardless of the
hardware, the guest OS sees a single unified hardware set on any
computer that doesn't relfect the real hardware.  So it is
useless debugging say an eexpress100 driver, because VMware
presents the hardware as an AMD LANCE NIC... etc...
It is certainly useful for many other situations that are not
hardware specific though.

Want to run Microsoft Windows software in Linux?  You can!  VMware allows 
you to install and run other operating systems inside a window in X windows.
You can install Windows 95/98/NT/2000, FreeBSD, Solaris, and many more.
3D Games do not work yet, but virtually all office and productivity software
runs excellent.
