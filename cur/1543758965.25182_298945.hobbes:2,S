Ah, but you are assuming people think logically and they don't.  "2.6.ODD 
doesn't say beta so it can't be beta, right?"  I think this directly 
translates to the actually happening "0.x is not 1.x so it can't be 
usable, right?"  Both statements are crap but the second is real world and 
the first by analogy could be real world.
Best regards,
