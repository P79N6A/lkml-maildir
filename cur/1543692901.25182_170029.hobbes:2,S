I'm seeing a failure with the 5th DES ECB test vector:
  testing des ECB encryption
  [...]
  test 5 (64 bit key):
  5630092f0161d576
  fail
Could you also retain the weak key test for DES?  Just add another field
to the test vector struct to indicate that CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_WEAK_KEY needs 
to be set prior to setkey(), then clear it after the test.  (Once you do
this the above test vector should fail anyway, which is probably why it 
is buggy -- it's never been run).
Also, a minor nit: please be careful about this kind of thing:

Otherwise, it looks good.
Thanks,
