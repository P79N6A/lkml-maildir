sparse is a tool written by Linus that allows stricter type checking.
We use to verify that drivers don't directly dereference pointers to
userspace or I/O memory and that we always perform byte swapping on
hardware structures that have a defined endianess.
Unfortunately Linus doesn't seem to release tarballs of it, but Al Viro
has a semi-recent version at
    
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/people/viro/sparse.tar.bz2
To use it on a kernel tree build and install it and then compile your
driver with make C=1.  This doesn't check endianess yet, for that check
you need to edit the toplevel Makefile and add -Wbitwise to the
CHECKFLAGS line.

While Linux 2.4 offers getting the host, id and lun from the scsi_cmnd
directly you can also get them from the scsi_device, so you can use
the above variants directly for both 2.4 and 2.6
