   Is this normal? - Because it seems the amount of time to recover from a
   hang is inversely proportional to the amount of work it is doing, I am
   able to artificially improve the "uptime" of the card by permanantly
   running a ping -f <host> on the box!!
What I believe happens is that when the RX overflow condition occurs,
there will be some packets that will be corrupted as a result.
I find it really odd that you can reproduce this condition so readily.
Does it happen under normal usage or do you have to issue a ping flood
or some other packet intensive job to trigger the problem?  Also, are
you getting Pause enabled on the link consistently?
