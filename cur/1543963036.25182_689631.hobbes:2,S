Why do you say that TASK_KILLABLE allows the freezer to work in some
situations where it couldn't before?  If something's using one of the
killable functions, it means that it knows how to clean up and unwind
gracefully if the task receives a fatal signal.  I don't understand what
connection there is to the freezer.
