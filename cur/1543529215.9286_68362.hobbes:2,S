Hello,
Thanks to Thomas Davis, Kernel 2.3.50 now contains a network bonding
module, effectively allowing you to combine several network interfaces
into a virtual one, distributing packets sent to it equally over the real
ones. I modified ifenslave.c so that it will allow you to set this up,
WITHOUT rendering the real interfaces inaccessible. Ie, you can use both
the real interfaces as you would normally do, AND the bonding interface.
They can all have different IP addresses.
