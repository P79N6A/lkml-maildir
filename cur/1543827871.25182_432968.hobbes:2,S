There is something based on FUSE:
http://lwn.net/Articles/173617/
Which involves UML... doesn't seem a good option to me...
My approach is simpler:
1. Change pmount so it supports loopback devices
2. Change the /dev/loop* group permissions.
You can accomplish 2 by modifying udev rules, the kernel or chgrp directly.
I just wondered if the kernel how the kernel could be changed and why it wouldn't be a good idea.
Cheers,
Pablo
