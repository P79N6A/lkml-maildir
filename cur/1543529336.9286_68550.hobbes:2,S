Indeed.  I'd just finished compiling 2.3.51 myself (with parport stuff
modularized) without a problem, but your message tipped me off to do a
quick depmod, which gave unresolved symbols in parport_pc.o.
It looks like a large batch of changes were made in 2.3.51 in
parport_pc.c, completely eliminating the parport_pc_init_pci function,
but include/asm-i386/parport.h still calls it.
The ChangeLog has two new entries from twaugh@redhat.com, who is
listed as one of the parport maintainers.  Tim, I've CC'd you in hopes
that you can shed some light on this?
