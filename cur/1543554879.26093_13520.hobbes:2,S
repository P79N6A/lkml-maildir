Hi Mikael,
Arguably, it is always better to parse /proc/cpuinfo instead of executing
CPUID directly (think PCI -- drivers should _NOT_ get their irq/io/etc
values from config space directly but only what the kernel puts on a plate
for them in the struct pci_dev).
So, one could imagine the kernel which emulates in software some of the
processor features and then CPUID would lie but /proc/cpuinfo would tell
the truth.
Also, Linux is very stable wrt to application interfaces (I compare Linux
with Linux and not Linux with "non-Linux", cf 1Cor 2:13) so one can safely
rely on the exported data formats to stay always the same (to a reasonable
extent).
Regards,
Tigran
