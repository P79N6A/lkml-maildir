running 2.2.18 on a AMD486DX4 - 120 with 34Mb Ram running RH6.2 I obtained
these errors while trying to copy files from a burnt CD.

The system locked hard with the drive light on, not accepting commands via
telnet. I plugged in a Keyboard and Monitor and line after line of:
hdb: Missed Interupt   (As close as i can get via memory).
Holding Ctrl+Alt+SysRq responded in what looked like the screen switching
between a login screen and the afformentioned error messages.
