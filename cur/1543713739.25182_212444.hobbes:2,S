Hotremoval things are a bit confusing.
There are __GFP_HOTREMOVABLE macro for alloc_page and
node_zonelists[ZONE_HOTREMOVABLE], but there's no
node_zones[ZONE_HOTREMOVABLE].  Hotremovable attribute of a zone is
stored in its pgdat.
And every zone can be hotremovable.

This is necessary for handling mlocked pages.

Because __GFP_HOTREMOVABLE & ~ __GFP_HIGHMEM evaluates to __GFP_DMA.

Ok.

This code was used when build_zonelists_node was called from
build_zonelists even if CONFIG_MEMHOTPLUG was defined.
So, this diff is no longer necessary.

This diff is also no longer necessary, but unused tail elements of
zonelist is zeroed in build_zonelists anyway.
