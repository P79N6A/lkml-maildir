hello:
I have a Seagate Barracuda IV (80 Gb) connected to parallel ata on a 
nforce-2 motherboard.
If any of you want for me to test any patch to fix the "seagate issue", 
please, count on me. I have a SATA sis3112 and a parallel-to-serial 
converter. If I'm of any help to you, drop me an email.
By the way, I'm only getting 32 MB/s   (hdparm -tT /dev/hda) on my 
actual parallel ata. Is this enough for an ATA-100 device?
Thanks a lot.
