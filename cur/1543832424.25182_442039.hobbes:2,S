No, I didn't quite mean a manual touch, but a system call to "close and 
set time to high resolution" for files where time uniformity is 
important. Consider that in most cases the inodes times are set by the 
host machine clock, which I close the change reflects the fileserving 
host idea of time. If there were a call to close a file and set the 
times like touch, then that could be used, for both local and network files.
Clearly if multiple clients are changing the same file that doesn't 
work, and I doubt that any solution is going to avoid at least some 
undesired side effects.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
