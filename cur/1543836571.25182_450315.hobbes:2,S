Yes, but you can compile one kernel for any set of hypervisors, so if 
you want both Xen and VMI, then compile both in.  (You always get bare 
hardware support.)

Why?  That's like saying that distros will only bother to compile in one 
scsi driver.
The hypervisor driver is tricker than a normal kernel device driver, 
because in general it needs to be present from very early in boot, which 
precludes it from being a normal module.  There's hope that we'll be 
able to support hypervisor drivers as boot-time grub/multiboot modules, 
so you'll be able to compile up a new hypervisor driver for a particular 
kernel and use it without recompiling the whole thing.
