Thanks! And together with the "disable built-in" patch we have a much
more user-friendly system...

Yes, if there is enough interest. I think autogenerating documents
from source code is the right way to do it, but I am not sure about
the disadvantages. Maybe someone could enlighten me? The latest patch
does not support obsolete MODULE_PARM() parameters - so I need to add
that to next release but that is no biggie.

Great, thanks! I prefer to do prototype hacking in ruby, but I realize
that "the magic duct tape language" is more suitable.. =)
Also, I am thinking of using a prefix with the parameter type to
determine the origin of the parameter, ie:
prefix "s:" means from __setup()
prefix "e:" means from early_param()
prefix "m:" means from module_param()
prefix "o:" means from obsolete MODULE_PARM()
Then I would like to let the script convert the types to a common set of types.
I thought about treating descriptions without parameters as errors,
and generate warnings about parameters without description. And to
reduce the amount of warnings I think it is a good idea to add a
SETUP_DESC() as suggested by Matt Domsch.

Exactly! =)
