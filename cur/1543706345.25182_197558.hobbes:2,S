One of the weakest arguments - who really cares if the kernel sets some
device names?  Makedev users rarely change those names either, although
they can.  Those rare cases where you need to rename a device so some
stupid binary-only thing can find it is solvable by symlinks.
Devfs is dying because nobody bothers fixing it (and it is believed
to be a big job).  Those who can seems to like udev.  No matter what
virtues devfs may have - arguments are useless unless someone volunteers
to maintain it.  I don't think it will disappear if someone does that and
does it well, but I am sure it _will_ go if nobody does.
A nice concept not yet implemented properly doesn't cut it.

Devfs can do this, but it is not necessarily a good thing.
I tried it - and it only works if someone tries to look up
a particluar name, such as /dev/dsp.  It doesn't work when someone
does a "ls /dev" to see what devices is there.
A "ls /dev/dsp*" didn't find the multiple soundcards for which
modules weren't yet loaded.
So you can list and see nothing, and still have stuff magically
appear _if_ you know what the name ought to be.  A hairy concept.
Do you know the device name for the second sound device?
The point of this is module users - they can delay module loading
till the module is needed.  Supporting opening of "nonexisting" devices
required a trigger mechanism though - devfsd had to know what module
to load at lookup time.
Non-devfs setups (with or without udev) support a similiar trigger
mechanism for module loading, that is simpler to set up and understand.
And that is a persistend device node.  Plain, simple, and ls sees it too.
Open it and the device is loaded as needed.  And at open time, not
at lookup time.  Load at lookup time might not be necessary, after all.
devfs gave us a /dev uncluttered by nonexisting hardware - now
udev can do that part and some persistent nodes can do the module 
loading part.

I worried about this too, but notice which way the kernel is going.
"Essential" stuff like parsing the disk partition tables (or getting
a nfs root via dhcp) is being moved out of the kernel and into a
early userspace in initramfs.  Such a thing _must not_ break, so it
is the perfect place to put udev too.  It won't break from mere
misconfiguration because the initramfs isn't on disk but stuffed into
the kernel image where it is safe.  Someone who actually disrupts the kernel
loose anyway.

Not if it resides in early userspace.  Then you need to break
the kernel image.

If devfsd ran out of early userspace then you'd never be without that either.

It is fixable, but nobody wants to do it.  They have another solution 
they like better.  Feel free to fix devfs though, then we'll get
choice . . .
