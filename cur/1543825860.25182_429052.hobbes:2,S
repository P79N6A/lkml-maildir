I imagine something like a harddisk might use more power while
reading/writing than when it is just spinning.  It might even start
powered down until sent some command that causes it to spin up.
A scanner certainly uses more power with the scanner light on than with
it off, and it starts out off until it is in use on most scanners.  Of
course I have never seen a usb powered scanner, so it doesn't seem to
matter.
