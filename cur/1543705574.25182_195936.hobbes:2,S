Let me eat my words. Here is what I did to get it working (at least for
au8830):
1. Check out alsa-driver from CVS.
2. cp -r alsa-driver/pci/au88x0 /usr/src/linux/sound/pci
3. edit Kconfig to add SND_AU8830 entry
4. edit Makefile to add au88x0/ subdir for obj-$(CONFIG_SND)
5. edit au88x0/Makefile to remove 2.4 build cruft
And it works! :) I can submit a diff if desired.
