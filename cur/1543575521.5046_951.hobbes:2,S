Before of all I want to publicly apologize with Richard as never my
intention was to exacerbate him.

I've not access to this specific hardware but I was trying to fix the
alpha case wrt write[bwlq] function as I've had a lot of trouble with
ALSA drivers and 2.2 (that still now is broken wrt mb() and I've sent a
patch to Alpha Processor guys). This is the reason why I've given a look
to 2.4.

Now I understand, thanks.
I see that some core*.h leaves out of line some functions because they
are more complex than a choosen threshold.
