No it isn't!!  But I think that would be the problem.  I just realized 
that [after you wrote this] that I turned on 'parallel' execution in my 
Gentoo init scripts for both of those systems.
Tonight, I am going to change hdparm so that it runs xfs_freeze on all 
fs's just before tuning, and [of course un-freeze] to see if that cures it.
thanks,
  Joshua
