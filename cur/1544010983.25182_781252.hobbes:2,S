Yes, and we would like to get it in anywhere else it needs to go
(backport to 2.6.27.x? if that makes sense.)
It fixes a panic which can be easily reproduced in the following
way: Just create several "arrays," each with multiple logical 
drives via hpacucli, then delete the first array, and it will blow
up in deregister_disk(), in the call to get_host() when it tries to
dig the hba pointer out of a NULL queue pointer.
The problem has been present since my code to make 
rebuild_lun_table behave better went in.
