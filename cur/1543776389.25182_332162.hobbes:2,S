Interesting.  We should be turning that back off in handle_ra_miss() as
soon as hdparm seeks away.  I'd be suspecting that we're not correctly
undoing the resutls of ra_off() within handle_ra_miss(), except you didn't
comment that bit out.
Or the readahead code is working as intended, and hdparm is doing something
really weird which trips it up.
hdparm should also be misbehaving when run against a regular file, but it
looks like hdparm would need some alterations to test that.
