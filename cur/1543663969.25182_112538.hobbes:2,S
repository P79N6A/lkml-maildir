Tests on this patch have been for correctness.  However, we had done some
measurements sometime back (actually loong time back) to verify if we actually
saw any gains with similar statistics counters.  The results are at
http://lse.sourceforge.net/counters/statctr.html
Since, we already know that per-cpu counters are good from our experiments
earlier, I did not bother doing it for this patch.
