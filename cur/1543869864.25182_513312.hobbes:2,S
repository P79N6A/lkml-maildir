Hi Kamezawa-san,
thanks for your reply.

I think that way is not enough to control the total amount of
Dirty+Writeback.
In that way, while writeback_inodes() scans for dirty pages and writes
them back, the caller will be blocked only if the length of the write-
requests queue is longer than nr_requests. If so, Writeback may consume
tens MB memory for each queue, because nr_requests is 128 and the
maximum size of a request is 512KB. If you have several devices, it can
consume more than hundred MB memory.
I concerned about that, so I introduced dirty_limit_ratio to limit the
total amount of Dirty+Writeback pages.
Regards
