They're just bugs. That's why it's marked experimental, and unlike the rest
of the "experimental" drivers, we aren't kidding.
It's just *one* issue that has generated all the disk corruption reports.
Putting the processor into the C3 power state, in combination with bus
mastering. This is disabled in the most recent release. I'd love to fix this
one, but if it were easy, it'd be fixed by now. Maybe you can shed some
light - if you're willing, let me know and I'll describe the problem in
greater detail.

Could these discussions be opened up to a wider readership? Perhaps you
could use linux-pm-devel@sourceforge.net, or
acpi@phobos.fachschaften.tu-muenchen.de?
