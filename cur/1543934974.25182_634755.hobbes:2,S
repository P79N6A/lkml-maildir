This has nothing to do with the number of firewalls but with their
configuration. There's absolutely nothing wrong in having 2 or more
firewalls.

You're clearly not on the right mailing list for this. This is the
linux KERNEL mailing list, which talks about kernel development.
There may be hundreds of ways to disable (or configure) your
firewall but it is not here that you'll find useful help.
Check the vendor's site and/or forums, you should find more help there.
