Or Slackware, which is clean, simple, eminently hackable, and most importantly
of all, does not make patches to programs that gratuitously alter behaviour
which you have come to depend upon and expect.
I installed a RH 6.2 system the other day, went to invoke a suite of nice
automated kernel building scripts I have used for ages, and encountered many of
the issues mentioned in this thread.  The more I tried to do, the more tempted I
was to pull my hair out (and I don't have as much to go around as Alan :-)
cd /usr/src/
/bin/rm -f linux linux-2.2.17; ln -s linux-2.2.17 linux
tar xzf linux-2.2.17.tar.gz

  echo "Sorry, `whoami`, but your symbolic link,"
  echo "/usr/src/linux, has just disappeared in a puff of"
  echo "greasy, black smoke.  Try Slackware?"
