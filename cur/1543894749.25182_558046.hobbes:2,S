See "Section 0":
	The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a 
	"work based on the Program" means either the Program or any 
	derivative work under copyright law:
so yes, if you grepped for "derived work", you wouldn't have found it. The 
exact wording used in the license is "derivative work under copyright 
law".
So the very *definition* of the word "Program" is indeed limited by the 
notion of "derived work" - as defined by copyright law, and NOT the GPLv2.

Hey, I kind of disagree.
What is a DVD? It's just a "blob" of a UDF image, potentially containing 
the Linux kernel.
How is that different from a "blob" of some other kind of image (say, a 
cramfs or similar image) on a rom?
What makes UDF so different from cramfs? What makes a DVD so different 
from a ROM chip? Why would copyright law care about one and not the other?
So I really do _not_ think it's at all obvious. Personally, I think it's 
exactly the same case. Others disagree, but I've never really seen a good 
*reason* for them disagreeing.
