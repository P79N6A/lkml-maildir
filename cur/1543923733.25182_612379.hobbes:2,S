Subject: [PATCH] [RFC] Expose _SUN in /proc/acpi/processor/<...>/info
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello,
I'm looking for comments on the following patch that exposes _SUN
on processor objects in /proc/acpi/processor/<...>/info. 
This didn't get many comments on the linux-acpi list, so I'm
sending to a wider distribution.
I notice that acpiphp exposes _SUN for (hotpluggable) PCI slots
in /sys/bus/pci/slots/N/, where N is the value of _SUN. I'm not
so sure we want to go *exactly* in the same direction for CPUs,
because:
  - x86 systems might not implement _SUN for processors
  - ia64 systems that implement ACPI 2.x do not have unique
    values for _SUN across the entire system
Nonetheless, even non-unique values of _SUN are still helpful for
userspace to figure out which physical socket a CPU might be in,
especially when combined with information from /proc/cpuinfo.
Thoughts?
Thanks.

From: Alex Chiang <achiang@hp.com>
On platforms that provide _SUN for the processor object, higher
level software can consume the data to learn physical topology
information, so let's expose it.
Platforms that do not implement _SUN will see <not supported>.
