NetWare has always supported more than this, so this whole idea of fixed inode tables 
is somewhat strange to me to start with.  I am still looking through Hans code, but if 
this is accurate I'll just take a system out Monday and see if it works.  My only concern 
with Reiser has to do with the bug reports I've seen on it over the years, but Suse is 
shipping it as default, and we have been running it here for about a year on a production 
server.  I'll post if it crashes, corrupts data, or has problems.
