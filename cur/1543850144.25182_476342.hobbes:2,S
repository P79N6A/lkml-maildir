Thanks for them. Just a quick reply for the moment to say they're
appreciated and I will revise accordingly.
I should also mention that this isn't the only use of these functions in
Suspend2. There I also use extents to record the blocks to which the
image will be written. I hope to submit modifications to swsusp to do
that too in the near future.

With the modifications I mentioned just above, this would also be used
for getting the blocks which match each swap extent. I can remove the
macro, but just want to make you aware that it does serve a purpose,
you're just not seeing it fully yet.

Ok. Thanks. I think they're a leftover from 2.4 support :)
