Subject: MODULE_LICENSE string for LGPL drivers?

Hello all,
What should I use for the MODULE_LICENSE() string in a driver
that is distributed under the LGPL?  "LGPL" isn't listed in
include/linux/module.h as an "untainted" license, so should I
use "GPL and additional rights" instead?
I don't *think* I'm running into problems with EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL --
the driver has been working fine under 2.4 kernels
and I only recently found out about MODULE_LICENSE and
*that* whole mess -- but am not sure, since I've also
got an older version of modutils which probably isn't
performing the taint check.
Unfortunately switching to the GPL is not an option;
the driver was written for a third party and must be
distributed with firmware (proprietary, binary-only)
and client libraries (source available but still proprietary)
over whose license terms I have no control.
Alternately, I could just let it taint the kernel.
Thanks for any advice.  Cc:'s to jenglish@flightlab.com
will be appreciated; I am not subscribed to this list, but
will try to keep up via the web archives.
