You can achieve the same thing without the bigphys patch.  I was
using the bigphys patch in the Dolphin SCI drivers, but with 
these systems having all this memory these days, just the
standard get pages calls work well enough.  To see an alternate 
implementation of bigphys that does not rely on big phys, look
at memalloc.c in the SCI code base at 
www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jmerkey/
and download the latest SCI drivers for Linux.  I used to use the 
bigphys patch, but found it really wasn't necessary to do what 
I needed to do.
