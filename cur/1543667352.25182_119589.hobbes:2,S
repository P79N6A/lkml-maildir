Hi all,
IF i want to use the inet_addr in kernel modules, then how to use. What is 
the equivalent function to this or which is the header file that I have to 
include. If I include "arpa/inet.h" and compile as kernel module, I gives 
whole bunch of errors.
So please help me how to convert doted IP address to unsigned long inside 
kernel modules. All help is very mucg apperciated.
Tahnking You
Shesha
