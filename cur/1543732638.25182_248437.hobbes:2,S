Suppose I've got a tar file with an index attached.  Suppose it's
something like /usr/src/linux.  Am I expected to extract all code for
all architectures, with all drivers, all docs, etc?  Now, yes -- or I
have to figure out exactly which ones I need before I extract them
manually, one by one.
But with tar support for make (and so on), files can be extracted on
demand.  It's possible to do this in userspace, with named pipes, but
that's much slower and insanely clumsy.
This has further implications -- imagine a desktop, binary distro
shipped with all files except the very most basic stuff as package
archives.  They can all be extracted, on demand -- the first time I run
OpenOffice.org, it's installed.  If there needs to be post-installation,
that's handled by the .deb plugin (or whatever).
I don't know offhand how big OOo is.  I think it's something like this:
~ The installer is at most half (and maybe only a third) of the full
installation. That's a HUGE optimization!
