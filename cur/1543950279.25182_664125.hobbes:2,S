I've judged from the four common applicants (selinux, smack,
apparmor, tomoyo) that 10 would be enough. Anyway this will be
easy to fix when something longer appears.

Ooh I thought the dynamic one was better cause I remember I read it
somewhere on LWN that this is nicer for the RT-patches. I'll modify
it, no problem.

In the latest version (-v7b, in another thread, CCed), security_module_enable()
is also used to let an LSM know if it's currently loaded or not. This
was done to avoid using a `smack_enabled' global.
I'll resend the v7b for -mm once the LSM devs give their ACKs for the
-rc3 one.

You're the expert ;), I don't really understand the difference.

Thanks to Linus ;). 
I've sent a patch that added a similar global yesterday and it was 
knocked-down by Linus after exactly 2 minutes. 
The situation is handled now without a global in v7/v7b.
