commit e9720ac ([NET]: Make /proc/net a symlink on /proc/self/net (v3))
broke ganglia and probably other applications that read /proc/net/dev.
This is due to the change of permissions of /proc/net that was
introduced in that commit.
Before: dr-xr-xr-x 5 root root 0 Mar 19 11:30 /proc/net
After: dr-xr--r-- 5 root root 0 Mar 19 11:29 /proc/self/net
This patch restores the permissions to the old value which makes ganglia
happy again.
