If we will need it again soon - cache it.  If not, consider 
your device->device scheme.  What we will need is often impossible to
know,
so approximations like LRU is used.  You could have a object table
(probably a file table or disk block table) counting how often various
files/objects are referenced.  You can then decide to use RAID->NIC
transfers for something that haven't been read before, and memory
cache when something is re-read for the nth time in a given time
interval.
"n" and the time interval depends on how much cache you have, and
the size of your working set.  
This might be a win, maybe even a big win under some circumstances.  
But considering how it works only for a few devices only, and how
complicated it is, the conclusion becomes don't do it for 
standard linux.  
You may of course try to make super-performance
servers that work for a special hw combination, with a single
very optimized linux driver taking care of the RAID adapter, the NIC(s),
the fs, parts of the network stack and possibly the web server too.
