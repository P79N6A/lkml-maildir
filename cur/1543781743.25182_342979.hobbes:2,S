Whoa!, I did not expect so many replies. Thank you for your answers.
The thing is that the Computer Architecture area of the University I
am studying at is developing a parallel filesystem. Currently it works
as a stand-alone program (this is why it uses resources like
environment variables), and I have been told to integrate it in the
Linux kernel.
I have to justify changes on this filesystem code (like avoiding the
use of environment variables) to my tutor. In this case I needed to
find why it is not possible to use environment variables in kernel
space.
I was looking for a reference documentation which give a definition of
environment variables that exclude their use inside the kernel, or,
simply, I expected to find a design decision to justify this. But I
think I have enough information with your answers, I will be able to
elaborate a satisfactory conclusion.
Excuse me if the topic was so obvious (it was not to me) and thank you again,
