00:07.4 USB Controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] AMD-756 [Viper] USB 
(rev 06) (prog-if 10 [OHCI])
   Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV+ VGASnoop- ParErr- 
Stepping- SERR+ FastB2B-
   Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- 
<TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
   Latency: 80 max, 16 set, cache line size 08
   Interrupt: pin D routed to IRQ 10
   Region 0: Memory at efffd000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
This is also a rev 06 chip, on a MSI K7Pro (Slot A) board.
The only item I use with it is a Creative Webcam III and I have yet to 
see this error with any kernel version in the 2.4.x series.
So I think you might be right about certain drivers exposing the 
hardware flaw.
As for not blacklisting the whole chipset, its probably the smart thing 
to do, and for those who really really want to use the driver anyhow, a 
simple diff between the usb-ohci.c files between 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 shows 
how to remove the blacklist.
