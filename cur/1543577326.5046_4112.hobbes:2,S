Yes, but I also tested the normal dhcp client from the dhcpcd (sp?)
RPM. This one didn't work either.

Both did not work. And 3c59x from 2.2.18 didn't work
as well, and as far as I could judge 3c90x is not included
in the kernel proper, right?

I fear not :( It's a private project and my
budget is very very limited. The 3com card is exchanged for the
DEC Tulip card (actually a Netgear NIC), and I simply can't afford 
to buy another one, as they're pretty expensive.
