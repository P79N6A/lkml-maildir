This looks like total overkill to me. Who needs to optimize
CPU hotplug this way? If you really need this just do it 
at boot time with the existing mechanisms. This would keep
it much simpler and simplicity is very important with 
such code because otherwise the testing of all the corner 
cases will kill you.
BTW the existing mechanism already works fine for modules too.

That would be totally obsolete 386 era paranoia. If anything then use 
a CLFLUSH (but not available on all x86s)
