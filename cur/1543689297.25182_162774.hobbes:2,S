Same problem as a traditonal set up of a NUMA system - the scheduler
needs to try to move the process closer to the resources it's using.

Nah, punting to userspace is crap - they have no more ability to solve
this than we do on any sort of dynamic worseload, and in most cases,
much worse - they don't have the information that the kernel has available,
at least not on a timely basis. The scheduler belongs in the kernel,
where it can balance decisions across all of userspace, and we have
all the info we need rapidly and efficiently available.

Yeah, it needs lots of hard work by bright people. It's not easy.
