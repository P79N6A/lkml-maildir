Hmm thats not how I read the code.  My system has a standard IDE device 
as part of the chipset, and then also has a fasttrack controller.  The 
fasttrack controller comes in 2nd, (hence making it the 2nd controller 
and making it marked disabled).  I think your right about the 3rd/4th 
controller though, what happens to those !
