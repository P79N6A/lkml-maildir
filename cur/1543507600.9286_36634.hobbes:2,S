   For hot swap PCI we will need to change it on the fly anyway.
For hot swap PCI the driver or some other bus attachment notifier will
call allocate_resource for the pci_dev.  There is zero reason, other
than a fixup, why a driver should change resources, in fact it can't
as Martin mentioned because it has zero knowledge of what these
address values in the resource structure mean to the host.
