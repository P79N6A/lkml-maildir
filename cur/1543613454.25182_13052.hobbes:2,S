Well. Maybe under Marcelo this might change ... - Since this is your second
mail (I read) were you point out that the kernel _might_ need some updates
- are there Hedrick patches online I can give a try?
(btw. Did you took a look into the IDE's devfs registration where the hostXYZ
might be wrong  [last week's post] ?)
Thanks for you good work!
