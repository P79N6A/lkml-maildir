Don't do it like that.
Instead, do something like
	smp-power-$(CONFIG_SMP)	+= smp.o
	obj-$(CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND) += $(smp-power-y)
which not only is shorter, but gets a _lot_ more readable after a while.
It's also extremely useful for constructs like "include this file X is
either 'y' or 'm'". From fs/Makefile:
	..
	nfsd-$(CONFIG_NFSD)             := nfsctl.o
	obj-y                           += $(nfsd-y) $(nfsd-m)
	..
which just means that "nfsctl.o" will be compiled in if nfsd is 
compiled-in or a module.
You can make pretty complex decision trees this way - much more readably 
than by explicit comparisons.
