And when I transfer at 100mbps I get nearly 100% system (overhead) time
for this kard. The ethernet card ( on the laptop mother board ) that is
native to this machine uses approx 25% system overhead ( for the same
transfer specs).
I suppose there is no quick ans as to why so many CPU cycles are being
used by this device driver - xirc2ps_cs/ds/pcmcia_core ?
