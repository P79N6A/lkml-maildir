In theory, yes, but in practice, I don't think it helps.
For example, take RC4 -- it was a trade secret, reverse engineered
and make available to the public.
Now that its public knowledge, RSA/DSI claim its patented and will
sue you if you use it -- do you have enough $ and lawyers to fight
them off. (You can't use the 'word' RC4 either).
The real problem isn't the patent system -- its the entire US legal
system, and its only getting worse.
