Do you have nscd installed and running or have incorrect nsswitch/resolv.conf
settings?
I have several systems here on test9p8 and they all start up very fast.  Full
boot is usually less than 45 seconds, 60 for the X on my laptop.  What is
that UDP socket for?  port 53 I'm guessing?  Double check your dns setup, it
may be coincidental.
