Hello,
  I'm writing a character for my PCI based device.
  As per the requirement I need to export couple of base address to the user space.
  I have implemented mmap to achieve this. I'm differentating these two base address with the help of the second parameter, size as these two address spaces vary in size.
  I'd like to know is there any other better way of differentiating both these mmaps.  
Warm Regards
Arun
