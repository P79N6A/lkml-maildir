Hi again,
I stumbled into another problem:
When using ext3 with quotas the kjournald process stops responding and
stays in DW state when the filesystem gets under heavy load. It is easy
to reproduce:
Just extract two or three larger tar.gz files at the same time to a ext3
filesystem with activated quotas...
Unfortunately there's nothing in the logs :-(
Some general system infos:
reproduced on two different systems, one UP, one SMP
both kernel 2.2.17 + NFS-patches + ext3-0.0.2f
journal size 20MBytes
Any idea?
Greetings,
Juri
