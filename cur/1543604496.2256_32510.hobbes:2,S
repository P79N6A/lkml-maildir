Subject: Patch to sys_shmdt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

	Currently sys_shmdt() always returns success.  Below is a patch that changes
 this behavior to match the man page.  This patch will cause sys_shmdt() to 
return success only when it finds something to detach, and returns EINVAL 
otherwise.  The patch was run on a 2.4.10 kernel tree, but applies against a 2.4.12
tree with no problems.
