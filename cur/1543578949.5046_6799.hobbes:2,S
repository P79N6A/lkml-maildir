I experimented some further today.
using some printk i found out is was setting Fullduplex,
hardcoded that to half-duplex (mine is connected to a hub
and not a switch) , and it's configuration was 100Mbit
as it was supposed to.
Then i started looking at the start_xmit code and got
lost :-)))
Hope this helpes to pin-point the problem.
