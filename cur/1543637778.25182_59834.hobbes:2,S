There is also the promise of being able to do active defragmentation, an 
enabler for large pages, which have been shown to significantly enhance 
performance due to reduced tlb pressure.
So the 'never will be worth it' case is limited to loads that don't create 
any tlb pressure and don't do any swapping or mmap IO.
