nah, it's not nearly as "resourceful" as having a separate thread for 
each teardown type ... It is also the easiest to maintain way of tearing 
down stuff, so i'm quite happy with it. If then i'll move the mm_struct 
teardown to RCU too. (Later on we can do some 'fastpath RCU' thing 
perhaps, to force an RCU batch of work through quiescent state)
but this is quite likely a side-issue that probably has no connection to 
the crash Bill was seeing. Whether separate teardown thread or 
softirq-rcu, it's a separate thread already.
