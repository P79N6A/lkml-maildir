AVM cares a shit about the copyrights of us kernel copyright holders.
Your arm-based dsl modems or routers use linux in complete violations of
the gpl terms we allow everyone to use our code on, and you distribute
binary drivers that can hardly be argued not to be derived work of the
linux kernel.  You you please shut the fuck up and sodd off from this
list?  thanks.
