Ok,
I see, what CPU do you use? I'm planning to go for Athlon XP 1800+.
I do not see my services would use 100% CPU at any time but I cannot be 100%
certain!
I'll add 512MB DDR PC266 RAM (vendor unknown at this time).
I also plan to add raiserfs for two mirror 40GB WD ata100 7200rpm.
Any suggestions?
rgds,
Vasja
