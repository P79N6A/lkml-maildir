Hm... That's strange. When I disable serial console on ttyS0 (in inittab) linux will suspend correctly. Although this APIC error on CPU0: 00(40) appears though. Also my one and only fan in my power supply spins down completely. So the box will get quite hot after some minutes in standby mode... Maybe a hardware problem...
Thanks anyway. ;-)
