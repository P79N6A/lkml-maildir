Andrew,
Here is a set of patches that clean up the bootmem allocator. These
patches don't add/remove any features. They only make the code more
readable.
I don't get a lot of feedbacks during my first attempt except from
Dave Hansen where I tried to answer them.
It boots fine on my machine.
Thanks,
		Franck
