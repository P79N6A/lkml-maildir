It should not, but the hardest thing is often to keep values sorted within a
window. When you store your values in a tree according to a key, it's not
always easy to do find the first one relative to a sliding offset.

maybe we would use (TSC >> (x bits)) when TSC is available, or jiffies in other
cases. I believe that people not interested in high time accuracies are not
much interested in perfect fairness either. However, we should do the best to
avoid any form of starvation, otherwise we jump back to the problem with the
current scheduler.

I've not said I was worried about that (or maybe I explained myself poorly).
Even if it was once a minute, it would not bother me. I wanted to explain
that if the solution requires to do it that often, it should be acceptable.

Fair enough. But the solution is not there yet. Maybe once it's there, it
will be better than current design for all platforms and the only difference
will be the accuracy due to optional use of the TSC.
