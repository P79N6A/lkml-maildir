Subject: [ANNOUCNE] GIT 1.1.0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The latest feature release GIT 1.1.0 is available at the usual places:
	
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
	git-1.1.0.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
	RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.1.0-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
This contains all the fixes present in 1.0.8, with the following
enhancements:
 - "git clone -o $name" can name a branch other than "origin" to
   be used to keep track of upstream (Johannes).
 - Easier shared repository setup (Johannes).
 - "git describe" command (Linus).
 - "git --version" from an interim snapshot gives a more
   descriptive version name than "1.0-GIT" (Linus).
 - "git whatchanged" shows abbreviated object names by default.
 - "git checkout -- paths" and "git checkout treeish paths" use
   cwd relative pathname and work from a subdirectory.
 - "git checkout [-b newbranch] branch" works from a
   subdirectory and works on the entire tree.
 - "git ls-tree" shows cwd relative pathnames by default; full
   pathnames can be obtained with --full-name, just like "git
   ls-files" (Linus and me).
 - "git send-pack" and "git push" notice when the remote end
   refuses to update a ref (e.g. hooks/update) and exits with an
   error.  This hopefully would help Cogito as well.
 - "git fetch" and "git pull" automatically follows remote tags
   while tracking branches.
 - "git ls-files --others" can be used with "--directory" option
   to omit the contents of directories without any tracked file
   but instead to show the directories themselves (Linus).  "git
   status" uses this to unclutter "Untracked files" section.
 - Optimized "git pack-redundant" (Lukas).
 - "git daemon --base-path=/pub/git" can reroot the directory
   tree exposed to the outside world, similar to DOCUMENT_ROOT
   (Pasky).
 - "git cherry" can be told not to show everything we have (Yann
   Dirson).
 - git URL can use [IPv6address/IPvFuture] literal addresses
   (Hideaki).
