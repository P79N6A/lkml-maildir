Yes, it's an architectural problem with the Thunderbird core.  It turns
out that in SMP configurations, the Thunderbird can actually hinder
performance in certain cases (i.e. benchmarks show very little
performance improvement for dual Thunderbirds over single Thunderbird,
while same software scales almost linearly with dual Palominos over
single Palomino).
I don't recall the exact cause, but I think it had something to do with
poor cache interaction -- cache-line ping-pong perhaps?
