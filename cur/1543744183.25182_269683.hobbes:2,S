Hi,
in my quest for a unified /dev/disk I found some code in device-mapper
which seems to handle dynamic block minor registration. Are there any
plans to move that code out of device-mapper and make it available for
all block device drivers?
IIRC there was also a limitation that one block major could not be
shared between different drivers, even if the minor ranges they wanted
didn't overlap. Is this still the case?
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
