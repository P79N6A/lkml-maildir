I was asked to figure a way to get us over the 137G barrier on
the 2.4.18 kernel.  Going to 2.4.20/21 can be done in parallel
and I will explain this.
Moving to 2.4.20/21 is a large effort here.  If I need to implement
the larger drives in 2.4.18, I'd like to make sure that this
has not already been done and that I have the latest code.

Is there any reason why you couldn't upgrade to 2.4.20?
