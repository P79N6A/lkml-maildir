Guys, rootfs is there from the very beginning.  It's just a ramfs - doesn't
require any drivers, is writable and is there.  We mount ramdisks, final
root, devfs, etc. on it.  Presense of drivers doesn't matter - we don't
need any drivers to access that beast, since it just sits in pagecache.
No backing device at all.
