Ok, here's the url to my cleanup patch. I had to make a naughty hack to
get the changes in fs/partitions/Config.in to work properly with xconfig,
but apart from this, everything should be nice, neat and friendly. I've
made changes in Documentation/Configure.help to reflect my changes.
All platforms have been changed.
If the more controversial parts of my patch (the DANGEROUS-option and the
fs/partitions/Config.in-hack) aren't too nice, I can remove them and
submit an alternative patch.
The patch is around 60k gzip'ed, so I won't submit it to the list...
The patch can be found on:
