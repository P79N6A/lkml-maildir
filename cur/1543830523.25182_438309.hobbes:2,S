CPU0: smp_call_function() -> loops and waits for other cpus
CPU1: [irqs_enabled] - spin_lock(somelock) -> irq -> capture_wait() -> loop
CPU2: [irqs_enabled] ----- spin_lock_irqsave(a,..) -> toasted
CPU2 ends up trying to grab the same lock that CPU1 holds, but has interrupts
disabled and a pending external interrupt because of the smp_call_function()..

Yes, looks like I was too optimistic. Seems like we really have to go for
stop_machine_run() unless somebody comes up with a better idea...
