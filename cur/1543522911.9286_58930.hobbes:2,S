I could name a few things in the kernel that do that now :(

Well if the claims are true the performace boost is not so small. I
completely agree that its going to take alot more to improve linux to what
we want it to be.

I never seen your ideas. Can you point me to this list.

I agree. I also believe in a stable and secure system. Look at the eariler
post about my rewrite of /dev/graphics for linux-SGI and its design versus
DRI being port to linux-SGI. It doesn't give the performance of DRI but
their are reasons to use this model for higher end graphics systems over
DRI. Please don't flame me or start this over again.

Never heard of vmstat before. Pretty neat program :)
