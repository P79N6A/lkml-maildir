yeah, was my initial thought too. If you have an ssh login on any other 
local box (and have ssh autologin enabled), then there's a good way to 
script this:
	time ssh otherbox "time ssh thisbox \"sleep 10\""
this way you'll get two time measurements of the same timeout, one on 
the other box (which shouldnt be running the buggy kernel :-), one on 
this box, while the timer runs on this box. Here it gives:
earth3:~> time ssh pluto "time ssh earth3 \"sleep 10\""
real    0m10.141s
user    0m0.012s
sys     0m0.008s
real    0m10.278s
user    0m0.024s
sys     0m0.004s
