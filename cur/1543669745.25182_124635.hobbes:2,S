Thanks for the info.  I feel a lot better about trying gcc-3.2.2 now.
Does anyone know if it needs patches to produce a working kernel
and glibc on sh4?  gcc-3.0.4 needed a sizable patch on sh4, I seem to recall,
but not on ppc.

Yep.  I'm not looking forward to dealing with that.  Shame the gcc
team keeps making building cross compilers harder.
