Is there a reason for this?
we have our own patches that we apply (include, asm-mips, pci, irqs, serial 
etc) and they have worked for 2.6.8 and 2.6.10 however if you think that the 
linux-mips people will have fixed more of these bugs than me (and this 
specific one)  then i shal try their 2.6.11 kernel.
cheers
