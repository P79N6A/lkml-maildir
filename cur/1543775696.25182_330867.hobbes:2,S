I think this needs to happen (dummy goes away or it's contents are replaced
by cap routines as appropriate).
Currently in security_init() verify(&dummy_security_ops) calling 
security_fixup_ops is a no-op in terms of modifying dummy. In your patch as
you suggest verify(&capability_security_ops) now patches routines from dummy 
into this default capability_security_ops.  The code is already too baroque,
no point making it more complex.
I think the necessary functions need to be present in this new base structure
and security_fixup_ops patches from it into whatever new ops a caller passes, 
dummy goes away. As a bonus, at this point your capability_ops struct in
capability.c can really be different :-)

The intent here is to make it past the 
	if (security_ops != &capability_security_ops)
check in security.c::register_security so that it is possible to actually
register capability (capability_ops) subsequently as a module should you
so desire, no?
The above description doesn't impart that.  Plus why would you want to stack
capability on top of this base capability, even if it it supported stacking?

Ditto for this comment.

No point doing the memcpy if capability_disable is true.
