Subject: Kernel 2.6.17 and 2.6.18  SMP (A64 X2 3800)

I compiled succesfully these two kernels on my pc, but I can't boot, it
freezes with a kernel panic.
Firs it shows: powernow-k8 powernow-k8: MP systems not supported by PSB BIOS
(only with 2.6.18, not with 2.6.17)
Then 20 30 lines which I can't read as they appear in a few seconds (anyway
I did a video of these lines at 
http://napex.altervista.org/kernel.zip
 )
and they end with a : BAD RIP VALUE
Kernel panic: not syncing
I haven't issue with a non smp kernel
I use a 64bit distro
