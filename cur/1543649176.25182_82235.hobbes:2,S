	irtty is busted, that's why I asked for the driver you are

sick as well.

	Stop ! Daniele Peri has just released a new version of the SMC
driver (smc-ircc2, link on my web page). I would like you to try this
new driver and report to me. I plan to push this new driver in the
kernel soon. So, don't waste too much time on the old driver.
