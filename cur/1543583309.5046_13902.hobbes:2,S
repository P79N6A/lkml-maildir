I've recompiled my kernel to 2.4.2 (even tried 2.4.1) and I am having
problems with pppd. The error I am getting is pppd[1491]: read: bad file
descriptor (9). Under the kernel 2.2.22-16 (or whatever came default with
redhat 7.0) it work fine. I am using a default redhat 7.0 install.
I have tried compiling the ppp and options as modules and another time into
the kernel. I keep getting the same results. I have also downloaded and
installed the latest version of modutilities after getting the error. I
recompiled again and recieved the same error.
If for some reason this is not the right list, please tell me where I can go
to get help with this problem.
Thank you for any help,
Xavier
