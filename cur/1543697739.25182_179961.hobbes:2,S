As documented, malloc() will never fail as long as there
is still address space (not memory) available. This is
the required nature of the over-commit strategy. This is
necessary because many programs never even touch all the
memory they allocate.
You can turn OFF over-commit by doing:
echo "2" >proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
However, you will probably find that many programs fail
or seg-fault when normally they wouldn't. So, if you don't
mind restarting sendmail occasionally, then turn off over-commit.
