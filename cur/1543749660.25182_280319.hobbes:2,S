How bizarre ... I must have been tested that without spinlock
debugging, for some reason.  Grr.  I usually leave that on,
just to prevent stuff like this.
Here's a quick'n'dirty patch, msleep --> mdelay.  I'd rather
not mdelay for that long, but this late in 2.6.10 it's safer.
(And this is also what OHCI does in that same code path.)
