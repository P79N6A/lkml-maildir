i tried to read these registers on my cardbus bridge but on my system
the registers are zero (00) ... 
i tried to set these registers to the values ico had on his machines,
but it seems that i'm not able to set them ... if i read the registers
after setting them, they are still zero ...
is it possible to find out what this register is actually representing?
cheers...
