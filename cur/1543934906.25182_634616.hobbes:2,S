Right I am thinking about 64 bit systems where the alignment is 8 bytes.

Yup that hits it by forcing a rounding up to a size of 512 bytes because 
there is no intermediate cache size before 1024. The rounding up is 
a pretty weak spot in terms of memory use.

Well we can actually turn this around. What I gave was not actually the 
worst case for SLOB. The worst case is an 8 byte allocation where SLOB 
needs double the memory of SLUB.
SLUB 	512	(Nothing wasted)
SLOB 	256	(Half of the page wasted for metadata)
SLAB	119	(32 byte mininum alloc size + management struct needs)
But these are all extreme cases. Depends on the mix of allocs who wins and 
from what I can tell the avoiding of rounding up to a power of two gives 
SLOB a key advantage. If we would find the worst offenders there and use 
kmem_cache_alloc instead then we may be able to offset that advantage.
