I'm working on it now.  I expect to have something with in the week.  I
had some user space problems bringing up 2.6.15 which has cause some
delay.

I will review and integrate you changes. THANKS!

I believe this is the correct SSP in SPI mode behavior for PXA2xx.

DMA descriptor chaining the next optimization for the driver.  I want to
get the driver cleaned up, tested and posted before starting this.

Correct, I think the PXA2xx even states this in the docs.
Thanks your input, I really appreciate it.  I will send you my updates
ASAP.  Most likely a 2.6.15 version quickly follow by a 2.6.16-rc
version.
