You are correct.
For anyone using XFree86 4.0.2 or tracking what we'd like to be included
in Linux 2.4.0, please ignore all the drivers/char/drm/mga* diffs in the
last patch that I sent.  Ignoring those diffs will provide compatibility
with XFree86 4.0.2 for the MGA driver.
Sorry for the confusion.
