Subject: [2.6.25-rc2] stack trace immediately before rebooting/switching off

In 2.6.25 I get stack trace immediately before system is switched off or
reboots. It is too fast to capture it on VGA; netconsole does not capture
it either - probably network is already shutdown at this point. I do
not have serial port on this system.
Any idea how could I capture it? Thank you.
The problem did not exist in 2.6.24 and below.
