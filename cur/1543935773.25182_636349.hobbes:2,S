Already planned for 2.6.25, see:
http://marc.info/?l=selinux&m=119973017423487&w=2
That is in the labeled networking tree.

Right, the latter is reasonable.
Requires adding the class and permission definition to
policy/flask/security_classes and policy/flask/access_vectors and then
regenerating the kernel headers from those files, ala:
  svn co 
http://oss.tresys.com/repos/refpolicy/trunk
 refpolicy
  cd refpolicy/policy/flask
  vi security_classes access_vectors
  <add new class to end>
  make
  make LINUX_D=/path/to/linux-2.6 tokern
 
Dan knows how to do that.
