That will be the local port that is used to talk to the NFS server.

While mounting and unmounting you might not (I'm not sure) but while
accessing the filesystem you definately should.
You say that you see "nfs" traffic.  Each packet has a source port and
a destintation port.  For an NFS request, the destination port will be 2049
on the server, the source port will be 800 (or 799 ...) on the client.
