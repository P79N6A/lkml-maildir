There is intermediate buffering between the driver and
the line discipline called the tty flip buffer.
receive data flow:
driver --> tty flip --> line discipline --> application
When you flush input, the line disciplines flush_buffer() method
is called to clear any data residing the in the line discipline.
This does not affect the tty flip buffer
or hardware receive FIFOs.
I suspect the biggest problem is the data in the
tty flip buffer.
A new function to flush the tty flip buffer needs to
be added and then called from tty_io.c:tty_ldisc_flush().
Then a call to tcflush(TCIFLUSH) will clear both buffers.
This still would not clear any data in the hardware
receive FIFOs.
