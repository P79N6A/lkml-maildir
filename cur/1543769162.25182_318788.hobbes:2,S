Hi Andrew,
Cardmgr does not automatically start my pcmcia wireless card anymore.
orinoco modules are not loaded at all.
I still can modprobe orinoco_cs to get my wireless to work.
Cardmgr says this when starting:
cardmgr[27367]: no pcmcia driver in /proc/devices
Is this a feature related to the upcoming deprecation of cardctl ?
Am I supposed to use pcmcia-utils ?
Thanks,
Brice
