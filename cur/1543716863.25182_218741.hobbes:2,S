Subject: 2Gb file size limit on 2.4.24, LVM and ext3?

Hi to all!
I got a very strange problem: I can create files larger than 2
Gb (even 5 Gb), but I can't read them back.
- The simple "cat" command fails with:
  # ls -la pippo
  -rw-r--r--    1 root     root     2147483648 May  6 17:03 pippo
  # cat pippo
  cat: pippo: Operation not permitted
- A file just 2kb under 2Gb, reads fine.
- If I do an "strace cat pippo" it works fine! So how can
  I trace the problem further?
- The partition is an ext3 over LVM, kernel 2.4.24. Debian Woody
  (glibc-2.2.5-11.5). Pentium 4 2.80GHz.
  I tried both a quoted filesystem and a non quoted with same
  results.
- On a very similar system I have no problem, the main
  difference is using LVM here.
Is there a known issue? Can someone tell me how can trace down
the problem?
Many thanks!
