Subject: [PATCH] SMC Tokenring driver update

Hello Linus,
I have attached a small patch that updates the SMC Tokenring driver to a
more stable version. It is against kernel 2.4.0-test12-pre7, but should
apply cleanly to any kernel as it only touches smctr.c
- Fixes a timing problem in smctr_wait_cmd().
- Added enhanced error reporting and detection.
- Fixed problem with card detection when io/irq/mem are specified.
Thanks.
