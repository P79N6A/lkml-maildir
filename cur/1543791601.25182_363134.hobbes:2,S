Alan,
I've done the benchmarking of the 3DNOW and non-3DNOW configured Geode
GX/LX.  This was done by extracting the kernel memcpy code into a
userland test application.  Time measurement were made using rdtsc.
The results are averaged over 4 test runs on a Geode LX. The tot_memcpy
is the total CPU clocks to run every memcpy from len = 2
through 4095 four times.  For the 3DNOW version this even includes the 
if (len <512){  __memcpy ... } 
escape found in the kernel __memcpy3d mmx_memcpy wrapper function. 
               No 3DNOW w/ 3DNOW  improvement
tot_memcpy      4635754 4360040  5.9%
tot_copy_page      2324    1853 20.3%
tot_clear_page     4398    1427 67.5%
These are meaningful improvement and the 3DNOW config should be enabled
for Geode GX and LX.
Best Regards,
John Zulauf
