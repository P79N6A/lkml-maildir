f_ino->i_sb should give you that information.

This, I believe, is the real issue.  However, we already have that
problem:
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <limits.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int rfd, wfd;
  char filebuf[PATH_MAX];
  rfd = open("testfile", O_RDONLY|O_CREAT, 0666);
  /* Now rfd is a read-only file descriptor */
  sprintf(filebuf, "/proc/self/fd/%d", rfd);
  wfd = open(filebuf, O_RDWR);
  /* Now wfd is a read-write file descriptor */
  write(wfd, "Tjo fidelittan hatt!\n", 21);
  return 0;
}
