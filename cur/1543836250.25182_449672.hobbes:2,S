I expect the code which these patches touch is completely untested in -mm, so
all we'll get is compile testing and some review.
Given that these patches touch pretty much nothing but the memory hot-add
paths I'd be inclined to fast-track them into 2.6.18.  Do you agree that
these patches are sufficiently safe and that the problems that they solve
are sufficiently serious for us to take that approach?
Either way, could I ask that interested parties review this work closely
and promptly?
Thanks.
