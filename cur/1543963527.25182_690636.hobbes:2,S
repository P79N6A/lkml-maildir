Watch /proc/vmstat while the tests is running.  If the "*steal*" numbers
are going up, the system is reclaiming memory.

Nope.

Yes.  open() will look up the filename in the dentry cache, read() wil not.
 If name lookup has a race agaisnt dentry cache reclaim, something like
this might happen.
But it'd be damned odd.

I can't think of any reason.
I guess a suitable test would be to run your little test app and then read
large files as fast as you can from as many disks as you can, to force
memory reclaim.  If that triggers the bug, and the bug is more likely to
trigger the faster you read those files, then we have a theory.
Damned odd though.
