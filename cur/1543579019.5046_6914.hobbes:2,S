Thanks to all who pointed out the pcnet32.c driver!  (And quickly, too. 
Perhaps one day I'll learn to do a "grep -i 79C973 drivers/net/*"
first.  *sigh*)
Now to see if I can get it to work on an ARM-based system...    gotta
love lack of cache-coherance.  ;)  (dma_cache_inv, etc.)  I'm open to
suggestions on that as well.  :)
Thanks again!
Eli
