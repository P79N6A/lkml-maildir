Ben,
 you added these two BUG() conditions in your atomic pte patch:

and people are getting them left and right when they start swapping.
As far as I can tell, the thing you test for is not actually a bug at all.
The pte may be dirty, but that's ok - the swap cache page is obviously
up-to-date, as it's actually physically the very same page.
I think you overlooked the fact that SHM mappings use the page cache, and
it's ok if such pages are dirty and writable - they will get written out
by the shm_swap() logic once there are no mappings active any more.
I like the test per se, because I think it's correct for the "normal"
case of a private page, but I really think those two BUG()'s are not bugs
at all in general, and we should just remove the two tests.
Comments? Anything I've overlooked?
