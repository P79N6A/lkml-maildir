One is free to use any number of samples. The short number of samples
was DELIBERATELY used to exacerbate the problem although a number
or nay-sayers jumped on this in an attempt to prove that I don't
know what I'm talking about.
In the first place, the problem was to display the error of using
an ANDing operation to truncate a random number. In the limit,
one could AND with 0 and show that all randomness has been removed.
However, those who know nothing about the theory would then
probably jump upon this as a "special case" even though it usn't.
