I don't think you have to.
The latest release from nemosoft is not in the kernel anymore, but still
online:
    
http://www.smcc.demon.nl/webcam/
It is supposed to still work with 2.4

 From the philips.txt included in the above reference:
    As of this moment, the following cameras are supported:
    [...]
     * Logitech QuickCam Notebook Pro
    [...]
(Note the 'Pro', this might be important!)
And as Luc said, once you upgrade to 2.6 you will have the same
support with his driver.
