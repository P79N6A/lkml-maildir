Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Userspace I/O (UIO): Documentatin for userspace DMA support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Edward Estabrook <Edward_Estabrook@agilent.com>
Here is a patch updating the Userspace IO documentation to
detail support to dynamically allocate and use coherent DMA
from userspace.  This patch applies against 2.6.28-rc6.
The gist of this implementation is to overload uio's mmap
functionality to allocate
and map a new DMA region on demand.  The bus-specific DMA address as returned by
dma_alloc_coherent() is made available to userspace in the 1st long
word of the newly
created region (as well as through the conventional 'addr' file in sysfs).
The kernel-api change is that passing an offset value of 0xFFFFF000UL to a uio
device's mmap() operation will dynamically allocate a DMA region.  This cannot
break existing code as the previous UIO code only allowed a maximum of 5
mappings.
To allocate a DMA region you use the following:
/* Pass this magic number to mmap as offset to
 * dynamically allocate a chunk of memory */
#define DMA_MEM_ALLOCATE_MMAP_OFFSET 0xFFFFF000UL
void* memory = mmap (NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE , MAP_SHARED,
		     fd, DMA_MEM_ALLOCATE_MMAP_OFFSET);
u_int64_t *addr = *(u_int64_t *) memory;
where 'size' is the size in bytes of the region you want and fd is the
opened /dev/uioN file.
Allocation occurs in page sized pieces by design to ensure that
buffers are page-aligned.
Memory is released when the uio_unregister_device() is called.
