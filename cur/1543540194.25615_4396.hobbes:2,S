There's no specification for this scheme and driver examples are
sometimes convoluted.
for each PCI MMIO region you use, here is a quick summary of the
"rules", vaguely in order of usage:
* obtain PCI region info using back-and-forward-portable macros
pci_resource_{start,end,len,flags}
* reserve using request_mem_region, check for NULL return
* cookie = ioremap(), check for NULL return
* communicate with MMIO region using {read,write}[bwl], memcpy*io,
memset_io, and io_remap_page_range.  addressing is accomplished via
offsets from the value in 'cookie'.
* never directly de-reference an ioremap'd area
* free region when done, with iounmap()
* release acquired resource region with release_mem_region
* On SMP, if to values are written on different CPUs to PCI MMIO region
at the "same time", the writes occur in CPU order
* MMIO Writes may be combined, but are not re-ordered, and MMIO writes
never pass MMIO reads.  (so, an MMIO read is one way to flush any
pending writes)
