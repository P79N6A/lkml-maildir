please lets not do this just yet. While i have no problems with the 
change in theory, the time code is in high flux and it's easier to keep 
things sorted if we dont do big code movements. It also makes it harder 
to review things and it acts as a hard merge barrier. We usually do such 
move chunks of code in 'quiet periods', and now is definitely not such a 
period. It's also pretty easy to do.
