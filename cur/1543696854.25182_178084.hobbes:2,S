I don't use this on my reference 2.4.20 kernel. I only tried it to 
see what would happen. This is how I know that I can only do this 
when I'm root. I didn't time anything or do extensive testing. 
Just enough to see that the child processes were also picking up 
the same niceness.
It did occur to me to remember {DOH!} the 'renice' command. It's 
been awhile since I was a *nix admin on an old Sequoia box. 
I have been thinking about trying CK's patchset.

The X server on the 'server' is responsible for what to display 
and where to display it.
The X server on the 'client' is responsible for interpreting that 
info for the specific client machines hardware.
Since the 'server' is also responsible for any needed file serving 
yada-yada-yada, I'm not certain how nicing the X server will play 
out. But I'm sure I'll learn soon! However see comment above.

Yes, it helps. 
FWIW, The BIOS is already the lastest available from Asus {Sept. 
2003}.
I'm seeing the same nForce{2,3} problems that other people are 
seeing with regards to all services on the chip except IDE 
sharing a single interrupt with ACPI assigning still other device 
cards to the very same interrupt. This is no longer true for me 
under -test9. :-) I suppose I should find the recent nForce3 
thread and post both my BIOS options and my -test9 config file. 
However, 2.4.20 also has all the nForce services except IDE 
sharing the same interrupt. And that works fine.
I do make an effort to keep up to date. ;-) I saw yesterday and 
plan on loading -test9-mm3 tonight. I even tried the forcedeth 
driver and was unable to boot. I haven't reported that because I 
haven't had time to follow it up with more info other than "It 
won't boot." I try not to make useless posts. When I have more 
info regarding that, I will post it.
Thank you Nick.
Later!
