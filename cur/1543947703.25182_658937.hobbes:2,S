Indeed, and this is already being worked around by
drivers/power/power_supply_sysfs.c:
#define POWER_SUPPLY_ATTR(_name)                                        \
{                                                                       \
        .attr = { .name = #_name, .mode = 0444, .owner = THIS_MODULE }, \
        .show = power_supply_show_property,                             \
        .store = NULL,                                                  \
}
