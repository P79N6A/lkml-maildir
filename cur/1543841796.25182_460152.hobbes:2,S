Hmm, so your bool is better than the next guys bool[ean[_t]]? :)
Seems like it'll be a few more days until the next cleanup patch
to remove _that_, so we shouldn't go that path.  Since we do use
the current boolean_t somewhat inconsistently in XFS, I'd say we
should just toss the thing and use int.
I took the earlier patch and completed it, switching over to int
use in place of boolean_t in the few places it used - I'll merge
that at some point, when its had enough testing.
cheers.
