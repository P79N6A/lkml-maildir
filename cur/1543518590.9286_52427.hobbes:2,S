Subject: very odd hardware clock behavior

Ever since I started running a distributed.net client all the time on both
processors, my hardware clock has been behaving very strangely.  After
booting 2.3.31 yesterday day I noticed that the kernel startup in my logs
was dated Dec 30, 1996!  ntpdate kicks in from the init scripts and fixes
it.  I saved the time with hwclock.  However, it doesn't stay that way...
last I was able to run hwclock it was about 40 minutes off.  I also have a
ton of "set_rtc_mmss: can't update from x to y" in my logs going back to
the time I started running the distributed.net client.  I'm currently
running 2.3.31 SMP w/ two P3-450's, and I was running 2.3.28 SMP when I
started running the client.  After a while my hwclock will completely
cease to function (and it has now, uptime is about 19 hours).  It will
just hang no matter what I tell it to do.
