My only concern is the time needed to converge to this fair
distribution, especially in face of fluctuating workloads. For ex: a
container who does a fork bomb can have a very adverse impact on other
container's fair share under this scheme compared to other schemes which 
dedicate separate rb-trees for differnet containers (and which also support two 
level hierarchical scheduling inside the core scheduler).
I am inclined to have the core scheduler support atleast two levels of 
hierarchy (to better isolate each container) and resort to the flattening 
trick for higher levels.
