I don't think it is the problem with sched_balance_self(). sched_balance_self()
probably is doing the right thing based on the load that is present at the
time of fork/exec. Once the node-1 becomes idle, we expect the two threads
on node-0 cpu-1 to get distributed between the two nodes.
Perhaps the real issue is how cpu_power is calculated for node domain
on these systems. Because of the shared resources between the cpus in a node,
cpu_power for a group in node domain should be < 2 * SCHED_LOAD_SCALE..
Once this is the case, find_busiest_group() should detect the imbalance and
move one of the threads from cpu-1(node-0) to cpu-3(node-1)

In my opinion, this patch is not the correct fix for the issue.
