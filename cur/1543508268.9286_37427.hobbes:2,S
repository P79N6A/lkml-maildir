Yes, but it's open(O_TRUNC).
I could reproduce a bug with the attached c-program.
Just start ~ 10 processes and wait [amd-K6 200, scsi, ext2 disk]
The bug could be caused by the missing synchronization of truncate() and
write()	
This is a known problem since ~2.3.7. [neither O_APPEND, nor i_size nor
f_pos are synchronized]
Unfortunately, it seems difficult to fix it properly:
1) affected files:
several places outside VFS access i_sem directly: [at least]
+ fs/nfsd/vfs.c
+ arch/*/kernel/sys_*.c
+ drivers/char/tty_io.c
2) different types of files have completely different synchronzation
requirements, so I think flags should be added to VFS which sync calls
are required.
+ pipes: nothing, even parallel read()/write() calls to the same filp
must not block in VFS [the pipe could use O_NONBLOCK]
linux-2.2 uses a dirty hack: fs/pipe.c knows that sys_write() called
down(i_sem), and pipe.c calls up(). 
+ e.g. raw-io: everything can run parallel _except_ parallel
sys_read()/sys_write() calls to the same filp [flip->f_pos!]. No
restrictions on parallel sys_pread()/sys_pwrite(). Note that this cannot
be implemented in raw.c, because raw.c does not know whether sys_read()
or sys_pread() was called.
+ normal files: parallel, non-overlapping read/write calls are possible[
overlapping writes violate NfsV2]. Truncate can run in parallel with
read()/write() if these calls don't access the area between [old-EOF,
new-EOF].
Even Windows 95 allow this level or parallelity for some files, this
should be possible under Linux as well.
+ everything else: I'd call down() before calling f_ops->read()/write(),
I don't know if all character devices can handle parallel read()/write()
calls. If they can handle it, then they should set appopriate flags.
