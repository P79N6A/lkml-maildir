Hi,
    I've found a small problem in the patch I submitted last week to fix
pci_do_scan_bus.  The pci_dev that was allocated was not properly
initialised and this could cause any number of problems with booting.
    I've fixed that problem, and I also changed the BUG() to a panic() as
per Andi Kleen's suggestion.
