I agree that this is a UML problem and I'm addressing it, too (it maybe wasn't 
clear in the original mail, but it's obvious). And maybe, it is even 
unrelated from this issue.
That said, indipendently from the UML issue, it is *meaningless* to read a 
config default from /boot or /etc or /lib/modules. And, in fact, you never 
say "it's a good thing to do in that case".
You later say "If possible, I'd avoid this patch at all". Why? Is this code 
too intrusive, or implementing a wrong check, or bloating the source?

Ok, fine. I was dubious on this, too (I went the lazy way because it's just 3 
duplicated lines).
Would it be ok for this to use:
struct confsource {
 char * path;
 int * cross_valid;
}
?
Since you didn't comment on this, I also suppose the env.var idea is fine for 
you.

When there is no .config and no other source, the last resort is taking the 
defaults from defconfig, normally, isn't it? So, when cross-compiling, that 
should still be correct.

* UML is always cross-compiled (even if the compiler is the host one), and 
most UML user *don't* know what they are doing.
* Looking in /boot, /etc or /lib is not documented at all, and "read the 
flaming source" is not a welcome documentation source.

Yes, this is another idea, which is also fine, while not excluding the other 
IMHO.

No warning is output. Or better, yes, you get warnings, but tons of not clear 
ones, like "warning, undefined symbol".
UML uses currently CONFIG_USERMODE rather than CONFIG_UM (is this a bug?). I 
have no idea for other archs. Do you suggest using KCONFIG_ARCH= or 
CONFIG_THIS_ARCH= or what?
