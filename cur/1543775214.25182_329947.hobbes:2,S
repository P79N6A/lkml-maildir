No, this can't do.  It conflicts with the other bit of requirements.
Specifically:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/exec.html
As you mention:
  [TMR] Per-process timers created by the calling process
  shall be deleted before replacing the current process image with the new
  process image.
But also:
  The new process shall inherit at least the following attributes from the
  calling process image:
  <snip>
  o [XSI] Interval timers
And this kills the latter.
