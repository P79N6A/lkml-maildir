Hello again!
The floppy driver and me just married...
Two questions [hopefully first last]:
1) Why does 2.4.18 kernel hangs when I try to boot it from floppy ?
   Symptoms: After 'Loading ... ' progress finished, the disk drive's
   led is still lighting and nothing happens anymore.
   What can be wrong ? CPU is correct (I even tried 386,586,p-classic,p-mmx,..),
   it's a P133. And howto fix it?
2) Somebody explain me what changed in vfs, where to find doc and give me some
   time to fix that damn 2.5 floppy driver. I'm gonna fight it.
3) oops, one more: Can somebody else please fix the apm issue ?
Sincerly,
Nico /* tired, but alive */
