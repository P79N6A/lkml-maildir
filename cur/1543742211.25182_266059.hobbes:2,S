No.  -As needs a config file.  Currently without the config file, it
crashes.  In the next release, without a config file it will fail more
gracefully.

These isn't really one.
  mdadm -Es -c partitions
will list all possibly arrays - you could then pick the one you want.
But choosing the drives to assemble to make an md array is a lot like
choosing the partition to mount to find the root filesystem.  It might
be possible to guess, but if you rely in the guess, it will sometimes
be wrong.  At install time, it is safe to guess if there is only one
candidate.  If there are more, you really have to ask.
After that, the boot process (or whatever process assembles the
arrays) really needs to have been told how to recognise components,
just like lilo tells linux which device has root (root=).
The output of mdadm -E could possibly be made more friendly (currently
it will happily list arrays that cannot possibly be completely
assembled right along side arrays that are likely to work).
