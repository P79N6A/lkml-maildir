I bumped into something pretty similar, although not precisely the
same, with 2.6.29-0.28.rc1.fc11.x86_64 Fedora rawhide kernel.
=============================================
[ INFO: possible recursive locking detected ]
2.6.29-0.28.rc1.fc11.x86_64 #1
---------------------------------------------
events/0/6 is trying to acquire lock:
 (events){--..}, at: [<ffffffff8105b843>] flush_workqueue+0x0/0xa4
but task is already holding lock:
 (events){--..}, at: [<ffffffff8105ae26>] run_workqueue+0xb1/0x20a
It appears that this during an initialization of AC97 sound system.
What I got is at 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=479778
and close to the bottom of
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=328808
It is a throw of a dice if this kernel will boot or not.
