Ok, for a cat test I see. This wasn't really obvious from what you

I don't see anything wrong in the small excerpts you posted, so can you
please just generate a few seconds log from a 192 sector and 512 sector
run and put them somewhere where I can download the two?
Just do the same sequence of commands you just did, but use -o 192_run
or something to keep the files. It's an interesting issue you have seen,
I'd like to get to the bottom of it.
