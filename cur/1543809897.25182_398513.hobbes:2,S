The real question is, does af_unix really need to allow beeing built
modular?  It's quite different from other network protocol and deeply
tied to the kernel due to things like descriptor passing or using
the filesystem namespace.  I already had to export another symbol that
really should be internal just for it, and if one module acquires lots
of such hacks it's usually a bad sign..
