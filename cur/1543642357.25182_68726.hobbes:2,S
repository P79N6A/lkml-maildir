Hi,
it looks like select() is broken for the cs4281 sound driver
in the 2.4 kernel. This breaks pretty much all GUI ham radio
applications that use the sound card ;(
I've done some tracing on various ham radio applications, but
none of the ones that use select() get any data from the cs4281
driver.
The applications tried include glfer and hamfax.
kind regards,
Rik
