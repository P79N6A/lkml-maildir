We are seeing some weird memory problems after upgrading to
2.0.37pre11.  For example, xntpd consistently gets stuck forever in
disk wait, sometimes on a call to brk() and sometimes on a call to
mmap().  Other processes seem to be dying in mmap() as well but are
harder to reproduce.
This happens on both of our SMP boxes after upgrading, so I don't
think it is a hardware problem.  Let me know if I can provide more
information.
