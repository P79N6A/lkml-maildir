Then those users shouldn't use the option. The standard behaviour would
remain the same, it only affects those who choose to use it. I don't doubt
it could cause problems on some boards, but there are many things which do
(like compiling for P4 on a 486 which someone local tried).
It should be marked experimental initially, and probably DANGEROUS
permanently.
