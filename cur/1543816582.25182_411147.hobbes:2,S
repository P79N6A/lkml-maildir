I concur with Mike.  The salt is long enough to effectively thwart any
possibility of a pre-computed dictionary attack.

Again I concur with Mike.  Iterative hashing is a very common technique,
and is very effective against this type of dictionary attack.  If you
hash 1000 times, then an attack that normally could check 1 million
passwords per second would now only be able to check 1000 passwords per
second.
Without iterative hashing, as computers get faster, so would dictionary
attacks, and then people would have to keep using longer and longer
passwords to be as effective.  Iterative hashing "levels the playing
field" in a way.

Again, I agree with Mike.  The cost is extremely small, especially since
the hashing only happens once per mount.  As long as we make sure that
on an average computer it takes less than a second, or make it
configurable so the user can keep it as small as they want, then I can't
see anything but good coming from an iterative hash.
Now what would be really cool is if we could auto-configure the number
of iterations so that it always ends up taking 1/10 of a second to
perform a hash.  Then it will always hash a reasonable number of times
regardless of your computer speed.
Remeber, a user is not going to notice a 1/10 of a second pause when
they type in their password, but an attacker will definitely notice that
they are only able to guess 10 passwords per second!
