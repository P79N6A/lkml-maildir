exit_mmap (where we call invalidate_all() and release()) is called when 
mm_users == 0:
void mmput(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
        might_sleep();
        if (atomic_dec_and_test(&mm->mm_users)) {
                exit_aio(mm);
                exit_mmap(mm);
                if (!list_empty(&mm->mmlist)) {
                        spin_lock(&mmlist_lock);
                        list_del(&mm->mmlist);
                        spin_unlock(&mmlist_lock);
                }
                put_swap_token(mm);
                mmdrop(mm);
        }
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(mmput);
So there is only a single thread executing at the time when 
invalidate_all() is called from exit_mmap(). Then we drop the 
pages, and the page tables. After the page tables we call the ->release 
method and then remove the vmas.
So even dropping off the mmu_notifier chain in invalidate_all() could be 
done without an issue and without locking.
Trouble is if other callbacks attempt the same. Do we need to support the 
removal from the mmu_notifier list in invalidate_range()?
