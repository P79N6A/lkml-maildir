I'm one of the VirtualBox developers. We are trying to fix the annoying
kerneloops warning 'BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context'
reported by the Fedora folks. This warning occurs when do_swap_page()
calls lock_page() and in_atomic() returns true.
This warning appears when we touch into memory which is pinned with
get_user_pages(). In VT-x/AMD-V mode we are executing some code in the
context of the Linux kernel. To prevent scheduling of the current CPU
core we disable the interripts. preempt_disable() would be probably the
better choice but this would oops as well if CONFIG_PREEMPT is enabled.
Kind regards,
Frank
