  Slab caches cannot be destroyed, but they can be shrunk 
(kmem_cache_shrink()).  There were too many conditions to be handed to
allow destroying (extra, protective, locking in performance critical code
paths).
  For modules, my thoughts were that only the cache ptrs (kmem_cache_t *)
would need to always be resident.  When a module is loaded it would check
its cache ptrs (against NULL) to see if they needed creating.  On unload,
it shrinks the caches.
  I know the Slab allocator needs a clean-up.  I'm working on a
replacment, which has per-engine (per-cpu) lists fronting the back SLABS
(this is for SMP performance, and ensures re-use of the most likely h/w
cache hot object).  Being able to remove a cache entirely is on my list
of features.
