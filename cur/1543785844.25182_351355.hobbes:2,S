I still think that this does solve only a completely insignificant part
of the problem. Given the zillion existing encodings, you are able to identify
UTF-8, leaving you with zillion-1 other encodings you are unable to deal with.

ACK, not literally.

I see a need for a feature which would help identify the charset of the script,
but the patch in question obviously doesn't offer that -- it solves only a single
special case of the problem in a completely non-systematic way. This does not
sound right.
				Have a nice fortnight
