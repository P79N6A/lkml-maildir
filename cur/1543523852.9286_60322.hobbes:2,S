Subject: [BUG] write(2) hangs in 2.2.[13-14] (fwd)

	hi all,
	i was testing my nbd array with:
	dd if=/dev/urandom of=test count=4000000
	on a raid5 partition. the test hangs one of the nbd client.
	the problem was on the client. doing:
	#strace nbd-server 100 /dev/hda
	showed that one of the machine was doing write() and it never
	returns.
	the hda is a 3gb disk.
	the kernel had the raid patch, but i wasn't using raid. so it
	must be the kernel. no oops.
