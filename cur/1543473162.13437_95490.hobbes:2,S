Subject: Patch for PAS sound driver (2.1.131)

Hiho..  I recently started looking at the 2.1 kernel by downloading and
compiling 2.1.131..  Everything seems to be working fairly smoothly
except I noticed that the sound driver for the Pro Audio Spectrum sound
cards has some bugs in it.
Luckily, these bugs are mostly the same ones I found in the stock
OSSFree package I had downloaded for my 2.0 kernel a little while back
so the changes weren't too hard (I have sent a similar patch off to the
OSSFree folks, but the opensound.com pages indicated that the 2.1 kernel
sound stuff is being independently developed, so I figured I'd post the
changes to the 2.1 source here as well).
In any case, attached is a patchfile against the 2.1.131 sources to fix
the pas2 audio driver to work properly.  I haven't yet had a chance to
look at the new 2.1.132 kernel, but my suspicion is that there should be
no problems applying against it either.  This patch can also be obtained
as

Please CC any questions/comments to me personally, as I am not currently
subscribed to the linux-kernel maillist.

Author:          Alex Stewart <riche@crl.com>
Release Date:    December 27, 1998
Patch Version:   1.0
Patchfile Type:  Unified diff (apply using GNU 'patch' utility)
Description:
This patch fixes bugs in the linux kernel (2.1.131) for the Pro Audio Spectrum
(pas2) sound card driver:
  * Fixed IRQ hardware setup to actually set the correct IRQ.
  * Fixed code to correctly address cards with non-default base address as per
    published specifications.
  * Removed apparently unnecessary module dependency which causes driver to be
    unable to load when compiled as a module.
