Just had a server's clock stop at 9:02:30am.  Very interesting
results:

Alan says this is due to locking problems with the timer I/O code. 
On the console were a lot of "set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 79 to 32"
type messages that have always happened on SMP kernels with ntpd.
Has anybody created any patches for this?
