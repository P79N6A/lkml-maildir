I already told you once that such a claim is totally bogus because
KLive _doesn't_ record anything about the _userland_, it only records
kernel stuff.
It's not Dlive (distributon Live), it's KLive and K stands for
_kernel_ not distributions.
Not sure how many times I'll have to remind you about this.
Also note currently the current cumulative uptime ratio is 1:18 not
1:47 and even the ratio of the number of users is 1:42. The only claim
based on actual facts you can try to publish on the press is this:
"The Gentoo kernels are 18 times more popular than the SUSE kernels
among KLive users (a service offered in his spare time by a SUSE
contractor that tries to gather data from many users worldwide)."
You can also add:
"Another data point is that among the KLive users the Fedora kernels
are 24 times less popular then Gentoo ones."
Free to advertise the above if you find it interesting.

I think people deserve to think for themself without you acting as
censorship filter for them.
