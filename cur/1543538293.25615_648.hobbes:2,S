I actually have, I'd just forgotten.

No one's suggested anything of the sort. In C++, objects know how to print
themselves.
Anyway, in_ntoa is inherently bad - it returns a pointer to an internal
static buffer. Extending printk, a nonstandard _kernel debugging function_
to print IP addresses for kernel debugging is perfectly valid. The thing
that's imposing obnoxious type management is the compiler warnings.

So we should take printing of pointers and integers out of printk and
have only itoa-style functions? Bzzt.
