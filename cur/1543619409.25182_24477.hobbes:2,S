The i8042 has a single byte output buffer shared by both the keyboard
and a mouse. If it's full, no more data is accepted from the keyboard or
mouse. Hence the problem above.

I don't think we need to have it built in. If we need keyboard support
(which is likely), we'll have it, and if we don't need keyboard, then
we can safely ignore the IRQ12 as well.
And i8042.c, once power management is implemented in it, will reset the
keyboard controller and flush its buffers upon resume from sleep anyway.
(A problem may arise if the machine doesn't tell us about sleep/wake and
handles it all in SMM ...)
