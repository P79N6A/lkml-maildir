I think for filesystems like /proc and /sys that there will normally
be problems.  However many of those problems can be rationalized away
as a reasonable optimization, or are not immediately apparent.
Passing a file descriptor between process in a unix domain socket is
a case where I can easily construct scenarios where there are
indisputable problems.  It is one of my standard thought experiments
to see if a namespace is sound.
