Yes on some architectures I think you right (on some archs though I'm not
so sure) - Ingo and I had that debate a bit ago.  But as you astutely noted
or asked below, the original intent was to be able to use a single shared
buffer for user and kernel space.  In fact, the lockless design of tracing
in K42, which motivated this design does that.  For a couple of reasons we
have not (yet?) done that for LTT.  But, for example, NPTL could have made
use of it when they were investigating a tracing facility.  Recently,
another company using LTT for device driver and video debugging is very
interested in cheap user space tracing in conjunction with kernel tracing
because they need both sets of events to understand what is up.  The debate
is still open for the best way to get cheap user space logging, but there
seems to be an increasing need for it by the community.

:-) - as above.  Furthermore, it seems that reducing the places where
interrupts are disabled would be a good thing?  By not introducing
additional disable interrupts tracing has less of an impact.  I was also
pointing out Christoph's statement that spin locks and atomic ops are the
same is not accurate (except for perhaps limited cases, but then you must
make such arguments - not necessarily good), and we had good reasons for
using an atomic op.
Thanks.
