Hello,
   I came to know from the book 'Linux kernel
development' by Robert M Love that the kernel provides
it's own linked list implementation. He has also given
the relevant interfaces. But with that I am not able
to understand the concepts. Can anyone send me a
worked out example of the linked list possibly a
simpler one?
Thanks,
selva
