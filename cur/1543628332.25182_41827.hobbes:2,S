Changed to
 * These are the functions for assigning a block of linear addresses for pages.
 * To give a safety margin, the linear address starts at VMALLOC_START.
 * This is at PAGE_OFFSET + VMALLOC_OFFSET which are all arch dependant

Is that ok?

Changed to
                /* The page table lock has to be released because alloc_page
                 * could sleep if memory is low
                 */
All good?
