The problem, I believe, with iget4() is that this will make a new inode if 
one does not exist which seems to be more running around than I really want 
(especially since in most cases the inode will not exist).
The number space is 18 bits, but even with 32 bits incrementing through the 
list will not make the problem go away, just reduce it to a very small 
probability.

It seems to me that delete_inode() is the place to hook into. I already use 
this for regular files, I just need to extend this to directories, pipes and 
other specials.
I knew about the regular file case because you can do things like:
  f= open("xx"...);; /
 unlink("xx");  // file no longer exists in directory, but still exists 
 read(f...)
 write(f...)
 close(f) ; // file disappears from disk.
I did npt realise that you could essentially achieve the same thing with 
directories, pipes and other specials.
Thanks for the help.
