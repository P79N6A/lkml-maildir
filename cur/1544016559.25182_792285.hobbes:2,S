<babe-in-the-woods> Seems that this feature involves adding something to
the kernel boot command line?  Or does the command line remain the
same, only the kernel's handling of it changes?
Is some documentation update needed/appropriate?
IOW: how does one use this feature?

I guess this macro should have an all-caps name, but this name matches
previous up-screwings?
