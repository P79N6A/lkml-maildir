It does not allow to mark events as ready.
And current interfaces wake up when either timeout is zero (in this case
thread itself does not sleep and can process events), or when there is
_new_ work - since there is no _new_ work, when thread awakened to
process it was killed, kernel does not think that something is wrong.
