Subject: Incorrect UDMA timing on VIA vt82c596b

I have been using the 2.4..0 test series for quite some time now on a
machine with Redhat 6.2 and gcc 2.95.2 running on a Pentium III 733
Flip-Chip on a Tyan Trinity 400 (S1854) Motherboard.  Until the recent
kernels my IBM 75 GB 7200 RPM Deskstar would only use PIO transfer modes
and only my Kenwood CDROM would correctly turn on its DMA and come up as
UDMA(33).  With test8 and the test9 series I have been able to get all
of my drives (IBM, Kenwood, Zip and Plextor CDRW) to turn on DMA and the
IBM and Kenwood will come up as UDMA(33).  The only problem is that I
have as of test9 tried the stock ide drivers and ide-timing file for my
VIA vt82c596b controller and I can't get the IBM to come up as UDMA(66)
as it should.  This shouldn't be a problem in my mind as the drive is
ATA-100 compatible and the controller correctly gets recognized as a
UDMA(66) controller.  The other puzzling factor is that my friend has a
smillar VIA chipset on an Athlon board by Procomp and when I built his
2.4.0-test9 with the stock ide drivers his 40 GB Maxtor comes up as
UDMA(66) and his 15 GB Maxtor comes up as UDMA(33) which are the correct
values.  I have my IBM as master on the primary channel, my Zip as slave
on the primary channel, my Kenwood and Master on the secondary channel,
and my Plextor as slave on the secondary channel.  Is this a problem
with the code for my controller or do I need to re-order my drives on
the IDE cables.  Thanks for any help.
Here is the portion of my dmesg file that is pertinent:
