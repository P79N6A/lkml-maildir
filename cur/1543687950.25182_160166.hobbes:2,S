Thing is that we use the platform model for off chip devices as well.
On ARM, its gets used for any device which the platform code knows
where it is located.  ie, a platform device.

Ah, but OCP can't be used to describe a platform dependent SMC91x
network interface that some random designer decided to drop into
their design - it isn't part of the SoC.

Note that we've already done some public work on providing flexible
platform device support to satisfy the needs of platform people -
by adding the variable number of resources to the platform device.
Also note that most of the x86 ISA PCMCIA devices _are_ platform
devices today.  As of this new power management model, they're
broken due to the fact that they no longer receive power management
events.
