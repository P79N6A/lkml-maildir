I'm fine with the name "jiffies_64_to_clock_t()".
I'd like "jiffies64_to_clock_t()" (without the first underscore)
even more, but this is inconsistent with jiffies_64. (And I don't know if
we want to rename the latter now)

OK, changed my patch to
+#if (HZ % USER_HZ)==0
 # define jiffies_to_clock_t(x) ((x) / (HZ / USER_HZ))
+#else
+# define jiffies_to_clock_t(x) ((clock_t) jiffies_64_to_clock_t((u64) x))
+#endif
+
+static inline u64 jiffies_64_to_clock_t(u64 x)
+{
+#if (HZ % USER_HZ)==0
+       do_div(x, HZ / USER_HZ);
+#else
+       /*
+        * There are better ways that don't overflow early,
+        * but even this doesn't overflow in hundreds of years
+        * in 64 bits, so..
+        */
+       x *= USER_HZ;
+       do_div(x, HZ);
+#endif
+       return x;

I'll send the full new set of patches off-list. They can also be retrieved 
from

Hey, this is just why I renamed it from "jiffies_64_to_clock_t()" to 
"jiffies_64_to_user_HZ()" before sending it off :-)

OK, will prepare patch for that later.
