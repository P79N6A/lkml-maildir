This is such a good format and great information for those who would
like jump in. They can choose and start working on the item that is
best suited by complexity and how time intensive it is.
I've seen individual todo lists on some preject pages, wish I was
recording such information, so we could gather all the pointers on the
common page. There is page maintained by Rick An Riel
http://kernelnewbies.org/KernelProjects
 which is just perfect for
adding all the links to kernel projects' roadmaps and todo items.
Would you mind to tie up your todo project link to this page Stefen?
Rick, I have a random list of potential projects that I should
probably first send to corresponding maintainers for review and
approval. But I think that ieee1394 will be great first item.
