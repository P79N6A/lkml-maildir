It gives us the possibility to create a "clean" design for modern hardware 
while maintaining support for "legacy" hardware.  You don't have to carry 
around a lot of special cases and distort the design to take into account 
something that almost no one uses.  
One of the reasons I despise that other operating system is the way it 
carries around bloat, cruft, and crap(!) to support ancient DOS stuff.  
Having your legacy and current drivers gives the best of both worlds, 
supporting ancient stuff while maintaining clean code for modern stuff.
