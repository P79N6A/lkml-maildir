Hmm, so why don't we just call it obj-y and be done with it? ;)
Since someone kindly enlightened me that LINK_FIRST was unsorted, I'm finding
it very hard to grasp what the difference is between an unsorted LINK_FIRST
and unsorted LINK_LAST list, and an unsorted obj-y list.  From what I
understand, obj-y = $(LINK_FIRST) $(LINK_LAST) ?
Therefore, there is little difference between:
LINK_FIRST = a.o z.o
LINK_LAST = y.o p.o
and
obj-y = a.o z.o y.o p.o
I still don't see what LINK_FIRST and LINK_LAST gains us, other than
potentially more confusion.  Instead of having one order-dependent
variable, we now have 2.  Please enlighten me further!
