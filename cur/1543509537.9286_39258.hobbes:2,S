	If your environment is already glibc 2 based, there
	the USER SPACE is already Large File compatible with
	64-bit __off_t type, and wrapper functions over real
	system calls using 32-bit "off_t".
	Note that if you keep using some low-level syscalls
	(open() comes to mind), then your code must be tweaked
	slightly adding O_LARGEFILE flag.
	Once the kernel is Large File compatible, it is mostly
	a matter of updating the glibc backend interfaces to take
	the advantage, while keeping the user-side view of things
	intact.
	--> should not be a USER problem if you already are
	    glibc 2.1 based (e.g. RedHat 6.0 as an example.)
	( glibc version might be 2.2 at that time, though.. )
	Now all that preceeding talk does not say anything about
	current Linux filesystems - block indirection based schemes
	alike all traditional UNIX fses have inherent metadata
	access induced slowdowns at very large files.  Also they
	are limiting maximum filesizes at the filesystem - here
	is a copy of a comment at one of my LFS test programs:
	( Oh yes, the way Linus wanted to have the block index scaling
	  done, does mean that maximum supported filesize at 32-bit
	  system is "mere" 2G*512 = 1024 GB; an alternate is to scale
	  with system page size, which supports eight times higher
	  maximum offsets.  The indices are signed entities to allow
	  an idea of cacheing i-node related metadata into negative
	  block indices. )
/*
 *  Execution of this program creates a large (looking) file at
 *  local system.  The execution of this program stops at offset
 *  which is just beyond what the local filesystem can support.
 *
 *  In case the local filesystem is EXT2 or UFS, the triply-
 *  indirection scheme can support up to following sizes per
 *  filesystem basic block size:
 *
 *   512        2 GB + epsilon
 *    1k       16 GB + epsilon
 *    2k      128 GB + epsilon
 *    4k     1024 GB + epsilon
 *    8k     8192 GB + epsilon  ( not without PAGE_SIZE >= 8 kB )
 *
 *  However, the basic block device layer can support only up to
 *  4G blocks of 512 bytes; being at safe side, lets say 2G blocks
 *  of 512 bytes:  1024 GB without epsilon.
 *
 *  The basic filesystem block size supportable at given system is 
 *  currently dependent on what the system page cache page size is.
 *  If the filesystem basic block exceeds of the system page size,
 *  the system does not work currently. (2.2.* series kernels.)
 *
 *
 *        bb = sizeof(basic block)
 *        B  = bb / 4
 *        MaxSize = bb * (B^3 + B^2 + B + 10)
 *                = bb^4 / 4^3 + bb^3 / 4^2 + bb^2 / 4^1 + 10 * bb
 *                = bb^4 / 64  + bb^3 / 16  + bb^2 / 4   + 10 * bb
 *  
 *        The primary term (bb^4/64) yields that 16 GB for bb=1k
 *        The 'epsilon' is all the rest, and is less than 1/250 of
 *        the primary term for 1kB, even less for larger bb values.
 *
 *
 *  The EXT2 (and UFS) can address up to 4G of "basic blocks", however
 *  that limit will likely to be beyond of other limitations from other
 *  parts of the system.
