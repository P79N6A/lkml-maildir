Doesn't solve the problem.  We have header pulled from include/linux/*
by asm/foo.h.  It contains generic UML stuff _and_ include of regular
asm/foo.h _of_ _the_ _subarch_.  Not a UML stuff that varies depending
on the subarch; we want whatever normal i386, amd64, etc. kernel would
get upon include of asm/foo.h.
See what I mean?  _IF_ we just wanted subarch foo.h, your scheme would
work.  If we wanted subarch-dependent header that would be pulled by
foo.h - ditto (sysdep/blah.h from foo.h).  But we can't do that when
we want #include <asm/foo.h> (from arch-independent code) pull some
UML stuff *and* asm/foo.h of subarch.
That's the problem.  Everything else is reasonably easy to deal with.
That one is not.  And yes, I know about #include_next.  I'd rather
stick to C, though, TYVM...
