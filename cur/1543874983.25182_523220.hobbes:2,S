This would be yield() semantics. A flag or alternate syscall for "hard"
yield() semantics would resolve this (likely trapped into via LD_PRELOAD).
It may also be useful to have a few variants of yield_to() (a.k.a.
directed yields), such as ones donating timeslices by pid, by owner of
sysv semaphore, by owner of futex, and to other ends of pipes and UNIX
domain sockets if unique or otherwise able to be made sense of. It's
unclear how easily the latter could be utilized by userspace, though,
given the number of applications and libraries needing to be updated.
