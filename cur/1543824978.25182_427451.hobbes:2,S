Well, it's going to be included as built-in and can't be built as a
module at all, so I think it's okay for us to do so?

Yes, we could easily add a callback to e.g. struct input_dev, but is
that really preferred if the input-ff.c is built-in?
And it's built-in only because: If I were to implement
register_something() stuff for this, no module would require input-ff
and it would not be loaded, even if there are ff-capable device drivers
present.
