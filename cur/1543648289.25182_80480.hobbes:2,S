You are not serious. the ISA bus cannot transfer data at this rate. You
need to use the PCI bus. The ISA bus transfers data at about 1.5 megabytes
per second. The GP bus (ISA without any slots, using a bridge), transfers
data at up to 3.0 megabytes per second. You can purchase standard PCI
interface chips for a dollar or so. You don't need to design your own.
You also need a serial EEPROM to load its required info upon power-up.
This is all standard, inexpensive stuff.
Search 'PCI bus interface' on your Web-Crawler.
http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_PCI.html
 documents some
'cores' and interface chips.

Data gets copied very quickly on 400 MHz or greater Pentium-Class
machines (about 1,500 megabytes per second). This should not be your
concern.

This works if you correctly implement read() in your driver.

If the hardware can do Bus Mastering, by all means use it. You need
to use a TCP/IP "connection" to guarantee that the receiver gets your
data. Using a piece of kernel code may send a packet, but there's
a lot more to networking than that.

If the driver properly impliments read(). It should work with sendfile.
