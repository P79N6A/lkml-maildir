The two times that I've done some big updates to
Documentation/00-INDEX I've also stuck to one line for each
description since that was the only form I'd ever seen - I didn't know
if it was a rule or not, but it seemed pretty sensible for an index.
It's also the form I've stuck to for the new files I send patches for recently.
So for whatever my oppinion is worth; I think we may as well make it a
rule for the 00-INDEX files.
