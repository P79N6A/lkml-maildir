Just out of curiousity what are the advantages to having a RAID1 swap
partition?  Setting the swap priority to 0 (pri=0) in the fstab of all
the swap partitions on your system should have the same effect as doing
it with RAID but without the overhead, right?  RAID1 would also mirror
your swap.  Why would you want that?
