c) is out, because this has to be executed after the early generic code 
and before the late generic code.
b) would be my first choice, and yes, it would be a good thing to have a 
generalized mechanism for this.  For the registrant, it's pretty easy: 
just add a macro that adds a pointer to a named section.  We then need a 
way to get the base address and length of each such section in order to 
be able to execute each function in sequence.
