Anton,
if you are doing SMP-intensive dbench runs, then check out the SMP
pagecache-scalability patch (against 2.4.2-ac20):
  
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/smp-pagecache-patches/pagecache-2.4.2-H1
this patch splits up the main scalability offender in non-RAM-limited
dbench runs, which is pagecache_lock. The patch was designed and written
by David Miller, and is being forward ported / maintained by me. (The new
pagecache lock design is similar to TCP's hashed spinlocks, which proved
to scale excellently.)
(about lstat(): IMO lstat() should not call into the lowlevel FS code.)
	Ingo
