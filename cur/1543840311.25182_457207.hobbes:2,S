If your raid is entirely on PCI plug in cards and you are doing RAID1
there is a speed up using hardware assisted raid because of the PCI bus
contention. If your controllers are PCI express, on internal high speed
busses (eg chipset controllers) or at least half of them are then
generally there is no win with hardware raid 0/1 and it is often slower.
