The Geode has zillions upon zillions of MSRs (all of them being Geode 
specific), so putting them in asm-x86/msr-index.h would be a bad idea
for both you and me.  But tossing them into a asm-x86/geode-msr.h file
would be good for 2.6.25.  I'll get working on that.
In the mean time, this particular #define is already in the tree, and this
patch fixes serious breakage, so I would really like to see it hit 2.6.24,
if we can.
