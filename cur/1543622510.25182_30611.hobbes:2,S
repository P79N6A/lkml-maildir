Yes I can. The main problem is that most people think that undeletion
is a magical way of getting around stiupid users. But the fact is
that the very same users very quickly adapt to the the presence of
undeletion facilities. And guess whot? They will expect you to
instantly recover allways a version of "this" file from the "stone age".
So the pain for the sysadmin will certainly not be decreased. Quite
contrary for what he expects. For the educated user it was always a pain
in the you know where, to constantly run out of quota space due to
file versioning.
