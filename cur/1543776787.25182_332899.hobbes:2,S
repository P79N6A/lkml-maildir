I went per node so that it would be minimal/zero impact for the no-node 
case, it would also simplify hotplug cpu since once a cpu in a node goes 
down, we still have other participating processors capable of handling 
its devices without having to do too much migration work. I'll definitely 
incorporate the node local allocations however, for some i386 systems we 
might be forced to stick some additional IDTs on node 0 since the IDTR 
will only take 32bit addresses and we could end up with only highmem on 
some nodes.
Thanks for the feedback,
