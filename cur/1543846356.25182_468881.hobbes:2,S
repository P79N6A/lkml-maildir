The "Math emulation needed in kernel" message means that it was asked to 
emulate a kernel instruction, and it refuses to do so. The emulation is 
_not_ meant to be a real FPU, it simply looks like one to user space. A 
lot of things aren't really emulated (there's no global x87 context, for 
example: the context is all strictly per-process).

Please look up address c01062dd in the system map (or just using gdb), 
that will tell you what code _tried_ to use the math coprocessor in kernel 
space.
