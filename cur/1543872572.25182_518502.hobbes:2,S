Ever since I started playing with suspend I started turning on PCI Hot
Plug support.... since then I have been seeing messages like whats
below from dmesg.... I'm not exactly sure how this actually impacts me
if it does at all. I just thought it didn't look exactly right so I
wanted to inquire about it. Does anyone know what is going on here?
