This isn't very obvious to me.
The licence doesn't talk about GPL or non-GPL exports. It doesn't
restrict the use, only distribution of the software. One is free to
remove _GPL from the code and distribute it anyway (except perhaps for
some DMCA nonsense).
If a code is a derivative work it has to be distributed (use is not
restricted) under GPL, EXPORT _GPL or not _GPL.
One may say _GPL is a strong indication that all users are
automatically a derivative works, but it's only that - indication. It
doesn't mean they are really derivative works and it doesn't mean a
module not using any _GPL exports isn't a derivative.
I think introducing these _GPL symbols was a mistake in the first place.
