Hmm..  I think you're right.  I don't know of a hotplug isa sound card. 
 I've essentially made the changes by looking at how sound/isa/als100.c 
was changed in 2.5.65.

Since that change was accepted, I just assumed it was right without much 
thought.  I guess I'll have to make a patch for als100 to use __devinit 
and __devexit.
