Hi Rusty.
I have not yet fully understood why you want to parse every source file.
I can see in the implemntation that you only calculate the sum of
code-lines, and not comments.
But why do we want to add this complexity - compared to just
calculating the sum of the whole file?
If the calculated sum is being presented as based on the source code
I assume people can understand that the sum does not match even after
updating a comment.
The current implementation fails to locate include files in the local
directory when compiled using "make O=...".
This is due to the fact that some files are present in the _deps
file with full path, others with relative path.
Example:
  /home/sam/bk/v2.6/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aiclib.h \
  /home/sam/bk/v2.6/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.h \
    $(wildcard include/config/used.h) \
  drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_reg.h \
  /home/sam/bk/v2.6/drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_inline.h \
I took a quick look and cannot explain why gcc spits out include files
with different paths.
My next question. Since we only parse a subset of the headers, is it
really needed to parse any of them?
My thinking is that we should either:
a) parse all header files (except those marked with $(wildcard))
b) parse no header files.
See also a few specific comments below.

You miss a "+ 1" to count for trailing '\0'.

gcc extension, you do not want to use malloc here?

Debug printf - to be deleted.
