I'm pretty sure I do suspending with most of RAM full. You have
big-enough swap partition, right?

Set console loglevel (see Doc*/power/swsusp.txt), and you should get
some progress. But yes, swsusp is slow; uswsusp should be about the
same speed as suspend2.

We call it s2both and yes, it is supported.
