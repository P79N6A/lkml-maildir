I think we can replace from tasklet to workqueue in many card-driver
codes, at least.  Many of them use tasklet simply because there was 
no workq at that time.  It's the correct move for such drivers.
But, yes, the code using tasklet in the core part (especially in the
timer part) requires as low latency as possible.
