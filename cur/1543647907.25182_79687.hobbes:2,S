If you followed lkml you'll see that I even explain authors of
very small drivers how to fit the kernel standards.  The situation
with those is a little different as they are not a framework and
don't add new APIs.  Thus it's only a correctness and style issues.
EVMS on the other hand is not only a lot of code but also a framework,
i.e. it folows certain design principles.  And I fundamentally
disagree with some of those.

Not having EVMS ~= not having a volume manager.  I don't want
to have to manage my storage farms without a volume manager either,
but that doesn't have to mean that I like the EVMS design.
