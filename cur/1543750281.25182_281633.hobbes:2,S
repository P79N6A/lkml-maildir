From what I saw the only thing that presently uses pt_rergs is SysRq
handler to print the call trace and if we slightly change the semantics
(instead of printing the trace immediately raise a flag and when next
interrupt arrives check it in do_IRQ and print the trace from there -
I even had some patches) we could drop pt_regs. I would very much like
to do so at least for input drivers.
