Hmmm ... clearly you must be using the 64 GB memory model ... lucky guy ...
my 512 MB single-processor Athlon is insanely jealous :). And you have 20 GB
free. So the system must be out of memory either under 1 GB or under 4 GB
for some purpose that requires a 32 bit (4 GB) address or a 30 bit (1 GB)
address. Hmmm again ... are there practical limits to what one can do with
memory over 4 GB even with PAE? Or is this just a bug in the 64 GB model?
