I have the same idea some time ago, but it is a bad idea. AMD7409 doesn't
have many registers which VIA has (need to have separate amd_get_info() and
initialisation checks), older revisions have broken SWDMA modes (need to
diognose this and don't use SWDMA on them) and slightly diffirent setting
of UDMA (yeah two bits). Also as Andre said there are new AMD chipsets in
the way. Keeping amd7409.c is good. Instead of incorporatig it into
via82cxxx.c I have rewritten it (some time ago) to have all functionality
of your new VIA driver. But there was no feedback (I don't have access to
AMD7409) so it's not included in main tree etc... (also it needs updating
to match VIA 2.3).
Regards.
