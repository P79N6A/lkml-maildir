Since this pops up from time to time, please let me explain what TIOCGDEV
does (if you know already, feel free to scoll to the end) and ask for

Can we do that in sysfs now? Back then, nobody implemented it for /proc
and it now already seems to exist as /sys/class/tty/console/dev
Does /sys/class/tty/console/dev have the semantics needed above?
