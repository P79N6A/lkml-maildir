I forgot top say that my laptop is identified (by DMI) as:
BIOS Vendor: Dell Computer Corporation
BIOS Version: A03
BIOS Release: 01/29/2000
System Vendor: Dell Computer Corporation.
Product Name: Latitude CPx H450GT             .
Version .
Serial Number .
Board Vendor: Dell Computer Corporation.
Board Name: Latitude CPx H450GT      .
Board Version: .
Asset Tag: Ñ^L.
Asset Tag: Ò^L.
Btw, that Asset Tag printk's are surely buggy, aren't they? Aren't they
supposed to dump in hex instead of some unprintable stuff?
