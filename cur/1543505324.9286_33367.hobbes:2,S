 I'm aware of the basic techniques ISDN works with but never wrote a
 single line of code for the drivers. As a programmer and user I can
 say that Karsten does his job very well and the code is very
 proffesional.
 On the mentioned i4l mailinglists are not just coders, but users, too
 who are forced to use the drivers regularly which means that there is a
 very good review on the code...
Servus,
