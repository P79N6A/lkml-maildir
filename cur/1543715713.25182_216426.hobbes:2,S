I'll look into it.  Note your test below isn't quite showing that;
what you want to do is do your writes, fsync, and then immediately
pull the plug on fsync completion - if all the data isn't on disk,
or the updates to the inode itself haven't been completed, then we
have a problem (barring write caching caveats, etc).
Having said that, the XFS flush time there seems too small - I'll
audit the code and run tests to check if we're flushing everything
out we that we should be.

Are you saying here that XFS on 2.4.25 shows this larger time,
as well as another filesystem?  (i.e. just 2.4.26 XFS differs?)
