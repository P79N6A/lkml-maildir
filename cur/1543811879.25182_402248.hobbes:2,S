So the function that will be giving you trouble is proc_check_dentry_visible.
The patch should be called something like: 
proc-Properly-filter-out-files-that-are-not-visible-to-a-process
It was the 8th patch on my stack when I submitted it.
Largely what is happening is that I fixed the permission checks that
have been in the kernel since 2.2 so that they work.  I'm not saying
that what I am doing right now is correct but it is something we need
to consider.
The logic is can I access this file in some other way besides through
/proc.
When applied to /proc/<pid>/exe
When applied to /proc/<pid>/root
When applied to /proc/<pid>/cwd
I have some concerns about it's correctness but when applied to
/proc/<pid>/fd/<#>
my only concern is if the checks are complete, or if we even want them.
There may be a capability I need to check that says anything goes.
There are 2 sets out file descriptors that will now be unaccessible.
- Files on internal filesystems like pipefs.
- Files on outside of your filesystem root or filesystem namespace.
If you share the struct file with the process everything should be visible.
We may want different checks for readlink and follow link.
If you want to kill the permission checks to stop the noise for a while
it should be straight forward.
