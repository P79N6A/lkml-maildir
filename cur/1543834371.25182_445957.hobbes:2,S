I've written a quick'n'dirty script for visualizing the 
interdependencies of the i386 userspace headers in 2.6.18-rc2.
In case anyone is interested, it's at [1] (warning: it's big).
The graphic also shows some problems like headers including not exported 
headers. I'm currently working on fixing such issues in my hdrcleanup 
tree.
