Why are you passing it as an extra argument when you could just use
mm->coredump_omit_anon_shared here:

And here:

Actually, I think I would just pass the mm pointer you have into maydump() and
let that dereference it here:
> +		if (omit_anon_shared) {
which would then be:
		if (mm->coredump_omit_anon_shared) {
Then the calls to maydump() would be:
		if (!maydump(vma, mm))
and:
		phdr.p_filesz = maydump(vma, current->mm) ? sz : 0;
I wouldn't worry, were I you, about the setting changing whilst it's being
used.  If you are worried about that, you can probably do some locking against
that.
