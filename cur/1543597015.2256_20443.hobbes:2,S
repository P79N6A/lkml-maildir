The problem is that "freezing" the kernel state and then
reconstructing it into a form USABLE BY ANOTHER KERNEL (not even
necessarily another kernel version) is unbelievably hard; furthermore,
it imposes a severe constrains about the kind of changes you're
allowed to make during your kernel development.
It's a bad idea, folks. Give it up.
