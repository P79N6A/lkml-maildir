not in the kernel in an ELF section, marked not loadable.  it never leaves the
disk.
as someone else posted, it's ~900 bytes gzipped (if you want to have it in core)
unfortunately (in the LILO case) x86 doesn't boot an ELF image... (oops)

If you have a lot of kernels around, which Config-2.4.3 applies to kernel 2.4.3
given 5 to choose from...the idea (same for System.map) is that it being in the
same
file they can't be confused.  Kinda like forks under Mac (but let's not go there
