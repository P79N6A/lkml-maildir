sorry for the delay. I was out of my office for 2 weeks.
The last RT version I tried was 48-36. it worked.
I'm testing 50-51 wihout succes.
One DEFINE_SPINLOCK is not translated in DEFINE_RAW_SPINLOCK in the
following file :
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/vm86.o
arch/i386/kernel/vm86.c:701: error: syntax error before ',' token
make[4]: *** [arch/i386/kernel/vm86.o] Erreur 1
make[3]: *** [arch/i386/kernel] Erreur 2
is it correct ?
I think I had not this error with 50-47.
