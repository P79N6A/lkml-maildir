As others have mentioned, using read/write on /dev/mem to get at
memory-mapped registers is unlikely to work on ia64 anyway, because
read/write use cacheable mappings.  Using mmap does work (using
uncacheable mappings), and my patch doesn't change that path.

It occurred to me over the weekend that part of this confusion is
related to the fact that ia64 doesn't have page tables for the
kernel identity-mapped segments.  (We're talking about reading
physical memory, but read/write_mem() actually convert the address
using __va() before doing the copy.)
I bet that ia32 does have page tables for this case, and that
an attempt to read non-existent physical memory will cause a TLB
miss from which copy_*_user() can easily recover.
On ia64, the same TLB miss would occur, but since there are no page
tables, the miss handler assumes the kernel knows what it is doing
and happily synthesizes a mapping that points nowhere.
