My reaction will be to clarify it to this person that this is not true (and 
thanks to the some of you who already did), even if I'm under pressure from 
development work/testing/patching... But this is just the type of person I 
am. Everyone is different so I expected some "rude" reactions. But there are 
people who are willing to clarify things (Alan Cox, Jeffrey Merkey, Diego 
Calleja on the clarification of dtrace being used on OS/2, etc). Many thanks 
to those... If some of you get annoyed (which is perfectly possible), then 
just don't bother getting involved in this thread :)

If there are I'm unaware of those, thanks for the hint though
