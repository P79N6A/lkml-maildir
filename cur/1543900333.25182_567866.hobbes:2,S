	Christoph -- I have a question about one part of the patches. In
throttle_vm_writeout() you added a clause that checks for __GFP_FS |
__GFP_IO and if they're not both set it calls blk_congestion_wait()
immediately and then returns, no change for looping. Two questions:
1. This seems like an unrelated bug fix. Should you submit it as a
standalone patch?
2. You put this gfp check before the check for get_dirty_limits. It's
possible that this will block even though without your change it would
have returned straight away. Would it better, instead of adding the
if-clause at the top of the function, to embed the gfp check at the end
of the for-loop after calling blk_congestion_wait?
