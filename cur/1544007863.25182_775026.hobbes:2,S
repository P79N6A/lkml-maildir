Ouch.  Better to return -EINVAL, like most register() calls,
than *ever* use a BUG_ON() for bad parameters.  Same applies
every other place you use BUG_ON, from a quick scan ...
For the unregister() paths a WARN() would be fair.  Again,
any time you're tempted to use BUG() or BUG_ON(), you need
to re-think.  It's hardly ever the right thing to do.  Just
report the error and continue; callers should check, and
clean up if something went wrong.

This may be a nit, but I wonder why not EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL,
which seems to be more correct in this case.
Another quasi-style point:  v4l2-device.s and v4l-subdev.c
are so small, and conceptually related, that I'd be tempted
to have one file not two.  Ditto their headers.
