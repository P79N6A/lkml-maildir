> Why don't you use the existing fuse-unionfs?
I thought about doing this but it would need to be modified somehow
and even then my users would look to me to fix issues and I don't like
trying to find hard bugs in other peoples code.
Also, there's a lot of functionality that funionfs has but I don't
need and the extra code would get in the way attempting to modify or
debug issues.
What I want is fairly specific and I've not seen anything out there to do it.
Thanks,
