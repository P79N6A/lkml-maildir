meminfo?
procinfo and other tools show a lot swapping, if that's what you mean, and you
can see it in disk I/O to the swap drives as well.

I see that kind of behavior quite a lot. Not just for DVD/CD images either.
Basically any large data processing fills memory with cached file data at the
expense of other programs and data.

I tried putting swapiness down to 30. It helped, most of the time, but still
I saw way too much useless file data being cached.
I would personally rather just limit how much file data can be cached. I don't
mind agressive swapping, I just hate seeing a ton of file data being cached
that isn't going to be used again.
I'm also trying the ck kernels just to see how they run. So far they work
better.
