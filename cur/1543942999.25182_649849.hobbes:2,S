My initial test is end-to-end 1000Mbps, but I've got a few different
packet rates.

I'm running juno-z with 2, 4, & 8 threads of syn flood to port 80.
wireshark measures 2 threads at 350pps, 4 threads at 750pps, and 8
threads at 1200pps.  Under no SYN flood, the server handles 750 HTTP
requests per second, measured via httping in flood mode.
With a default tcp_max_syn_backlog of 1024, I can trivially prevent
any inbound client connections with 2 threads of syn flood.
Enabling tcp_syncookies brings the connection handling back up to 725
fetches per second.
If I raise the backlog to 16384, 4 threads gives me about 650 legit
requests per sec.  Going to 8 threads makes connections very unreliable - a
handful will get through every 15 to 20 seconds.  Again,
tcp_syncookies returns performance almost totally back to normal.
Cranking juno-z to the max generates me about 16kpps.  Any syn backlog
is easily overwhelmed and nothing gets through.  tcp_syncookies gets
me back to 650 requests per second.
At these levels the CPU impact of tcp_syncookies is nothing.  I can't
measure a difference.  In the real world, a 16kpps syn flood is small.
People with a distributed botnet can easily get to the hundreds of
thousands, and I have seen over million packets per second of SYN flood.
BTW, I can trigger a soft lockup BUG when I restart apache to change the
backlog during the 16kpps test-case:
