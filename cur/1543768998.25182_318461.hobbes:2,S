hai,
     My task is to send the characters to any application as if the input 
is coming from keyboard. For that I created one character device file. To 
it I am sending input characters through ioctl. In the character device 
ioctl definition I am copying these user characters to kernel space and 
sending these characters to handle_scancode function. What is the wrong 
with this solution. This solution is working now. But waht I am asking is
istead of sending our ioctl to newly created device file, can we able to 
send ioctl to the keyboard buffer, so that avoiding the use of new 
character device file , whose purpose is just to handle ioctl.
I think now u got my doubt.
One more is, uinput case,
Whether uinput also doing the same thing, waht I am doing?
For sending user data to kernel sapce we should use ioctl ,is it right?
Plz  cc (mail) me with ur comments.
Regards,
Manohar.
