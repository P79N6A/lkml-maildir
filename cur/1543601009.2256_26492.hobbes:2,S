The rootflags parameter is only a part of the ext3 patch, AFAIK.  It
is therefore probably in -ac kernels, but not stock Linus kernels.
Since it is useful by itself, it may be good to submit it as a patch
to Linus (this was done once along with the rootfstype= patch) but
I don't think it made it in.
