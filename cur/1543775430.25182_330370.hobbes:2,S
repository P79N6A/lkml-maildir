Most of this is class_simple changes.
However, there is a huge set of changes to sbp2. One thing that sticks out
is the entire sbp2_check_sbp2_command() function being ripped out. There's
some changes related to TYPE_SDAD devices (where did this come from?).
Try reverting just the sbp2.[ch] changes from the 2.6.13-rc1 tree.
I'll see if I can figure out why our tree and kernel tree have gotten so
far out of whack and how such huge changes that don't seem to fix anything
(like the large changes to sbp2) have gotten into the kernel proper
without being tested. Most of the sbp2 changes seem to be a new feature
rather than fixing minor or even major bugs.
