I've observed similar effects without DM involved at all. I've been able
to reproduce using subfs (it brings out umount races nicely) on kernels
from 2.6.5 to 2.6.11-rc4, it's platform and device independent.
In my experience, the loop is actually outside of
__find_get_block_slow(), in __getblk_slow(). I've been using xmon to
interrupt the kernel, and the results vary but are all rooted in the
for(;;) loop in __getblk_slow. It appears as though grow_buffers is
finding/creating the page, but then __find_get_block can't locate the
buffer it needs.
