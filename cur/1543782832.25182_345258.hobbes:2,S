Subject: [PATCH] remove EXPORT_SYMBOL(strtok) from frv_ksyms.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
I hessitated a bit before sending this patch to you since it is untested.
This is due to the fact that I don't have the hardware, nor a suitable 
cross compiler to do so. I sent the patch to LKML a few days ago in the 
hope that someone else could test/validate this change for me, but 
unfortunately I got no replies. That left me with the option of just 
forgetting about the patch or send it on to you.
Although the patch has not been tested I have a hard time imagining that 
it could be anything but correct since strtok() was removed from the kernel
back in 2002.
Remove export of strtok().
strtok() has not been available in the kernel since 2002.
