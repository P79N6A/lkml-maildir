Not only is the bus running at 66 MHz, it's using the PCI protocol not
PCI-X.  Is there a card in the other PCI-X capable slot?  I think they
are on the same bus, so installing a PCI card there would bring both
slots down to this speed.  You should check the output of lspci -v and
make sure all the devices on bus 2 have the PCI-X capability.
