It's ok to mmap MAP_SHARED. But is it not a normal way to malloc() a space and
then registered to NIC ?

Yeah, of course.

I guess you refer to mmap a file MAP_READ|MAP_WRITE in MAP_PRIVATE way.
I think it is probably more logical to read the file data into an anoymous page and filled the pte with _PAGE_RW in the first time page-fault. It will probably reduce numbers of page fault interrupt.

Ok, we can deal with initial program data using the above flow.
