Yeah, sorry it's kept more as a reminder to me.  Upstream Xen doesn't do
this, but this patchset doesn't support ballooning yet, so there just is
not xen/balloon.h in the set.  When merging with upstream Xen there's
patch rejects either way, so I agree, better to just drop this since
it's just future placeholder.
