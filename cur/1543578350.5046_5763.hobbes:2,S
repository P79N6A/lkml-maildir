Subject: [uPATCH] Nulling mmap_cache iff needed (2.4.0)

Hi.
The following (trivial) patch against 2.4.0 (but should apply cleanly
against 241p1) makes do_munmap only null our precious cache if the
pointer contained therein is invalidated by the unmapping. I doubt it
will make any measurable difference but it seems straightforward
enough to be done anyway.
Running kernel compiles and starting X/gnome with this patch raises my 
cache hit rate a couple of percentage points, and I have a feeling that
there might be work loads out there that hit this kernel path more often
that these.
Comments?
