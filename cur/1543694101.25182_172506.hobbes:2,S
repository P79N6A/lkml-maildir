> hi Scott,
> 
> i am using your hot swap driver for one of our boards here. I have
> back-ported the driver to 2.4.18 kernel.
> 
> the problem is as follows -
> i have a board in the system slot of the chassis for which i am running
> the hot swap driver.
> when i hot insert another board (the configuration is given later) on some
> peripheral slot, i am not able to allocate resources for some of the
> devices beyond that.
> 
> the hot swapped board has got a bridge that provides two pmc slots. I have
> two bridges on these pmc slots and they provide 3 pci slots each. I have
> two 82559 (e100) ethernet cards beyond the two bridges, one 82559 for
> each. it looks something like this
> 
> peripheral slot ----------- P2P Bridge (Sentinel) -- P2P Bridge (21154) --
> 82559 (resources  are  allocated)
>                                                                   |
> 			                              -- P2P Bridge (21154)
> -- 82559 (resources NOT allocated)
> 
> i am able to assign the resources for the first 82559 correctly and it
> works, but for the other 81559 i am not able to assign resources.
> 
> the following dump will help to see that the driver is trying to assign
> resources to the other 82559 from a wrong resource tree.
> (The debug messages are added by me.)
