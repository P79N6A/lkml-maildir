Ok, sounds good.  Pop over to 
http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/
 and
look at what they are doing.  For the linux kernel, you are interested
in the DRM component.  You should read this link:
    
http://people.freedesktop.org/~ajax/dri-explanation.txt
which explains what each component in the linux graphics pipeline does.
Also have a look at this link:
    
http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/MesaDriver
Hope that helps you.
