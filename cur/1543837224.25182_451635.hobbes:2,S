Just tested, and yes it still boots, but my box doesn't have HPET so
that isn't much of a test. :(
As I said in the announce mail, I've not boot tested each step, I
suspect patches 4/6 and 5/6 will have troubles (vsyscall isn't disabled,
but the updating is). I'll try to address that in the next release.

The vxtime structure hasn't yet been removed and we set
vxtime.hpet_address = hpet_address in necessary spots, so it should be
ok.
