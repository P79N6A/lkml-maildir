Well, I somehow managed to post that without appending my description.
Here goes:
The current VMSPLIT Kconfig option is disabled whenever highmem
is on.  This is a bit screwy because the people who need to
change VMSPLIT the most tend to be the ones with highmem and
constrained lowmem.
So, remove the highmem dependency.  But, re-include the
dependency for the "full 1GB of lowmem" option.  You can't have
the full 1GB of lowmem and highmem because of the need for the
vmalloc(), kmap(), etc... areas.
I thought there would be at least a bit of tweaking to do to
get it to work, but everything seems OK.
Boot tested on a 4GB x86 machine, and a 12GB 3-node NUMA-Q:
