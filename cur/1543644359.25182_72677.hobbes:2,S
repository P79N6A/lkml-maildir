you have not understood what i have written.
what you do has the same (bad) effect as a global spinlock, it in essence
has the same cache effect as a constantly moving spinlock at the 'end' of
the trace buffer. Cachelines bounce between CPUs. Only completely per-CPU
trace buffers solve this problem.
