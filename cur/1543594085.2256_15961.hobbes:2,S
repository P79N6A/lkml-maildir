Yes, this one is for those who are not allergic to line-breaks messing
up the patch, it seems :-)
The only reservation I had was wrt. procfs, but it dawned on me that
we init procfs explicitly in init/main.c before initcalls are made.
So I've fixed up the line breaks and coding style issues, and applied
your patch.  Thanks.
