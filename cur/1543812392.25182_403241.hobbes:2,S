Well, I already did this when I tested Mingming's multiblock work for
ext3. (-mm only patch)
Thanks,
Badari
Mingming Cao recently added multi-block allocation support
for ext3, currently used only by DIO. I added support to map 
multiple blocks for mpage_readpages(). This patch add support 
for ext3_get_block() to deal with multi-block mapping.
Basically it renames ext3_direct_io_get_blocks() as ext3_get_block().
