If the driver calls ldisc->receive_buf it means it bypasses the
TTY_DONT_FLIP locking used by the n_tty driver. Am I missing something
here.

Most of that I think comes out in the wash with the ldisc locking. 
Once the driver uses tty_ldisc_ref() it'll get NULL back in the case
where the hangup raced the driver. I'm also no longer dropping back
to N_TTY in the hangup path. I couldn't see any reason this was
neccessary since the release will clean it up anyway ?
