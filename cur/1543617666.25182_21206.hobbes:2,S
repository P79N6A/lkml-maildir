Subject: [PATCH] vm_page_prot value
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following is a patch against 2.4.18-pre3 which fixes a problem where the 
protection on user stack pages are not marked executable even though 
the flags indicate the page is executable.  Some more aggressive cache 
flush optimizations may rely on the execution marking to indicate if a page 
needs to be flushed as it might be present in an icache which is not 
coherent with the dcache.
