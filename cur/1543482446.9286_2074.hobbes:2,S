2.0 supported the net interface 0.0.0.0 IP address convention (meaning
the kernel should accept all IP packets). 2.[12] don't, hence things
like many bootp/dhcp configurations which used this feature break.
The proper fix is to modify bootp/dhcp clients to accomplish the same
thing using raw sockets instead. I think dhcpcd
(<URL:
http://www.phystech.com/download/dhcpcd.html>
) already works
this way, but bootpc hasn't been updated yet.
There are a couple of interim fixes you can try:
- bootp/dhcp requests can have a flag set asking the server to
broadcast the reply. bootp/dhcp clients can be modified to use this;
these changes are much smaller than the proper fix. The downside is
that it increases the number of broadcast packets on the network, and
it requires changes to the scripts running bootp (the "ifconfig $if
0.0.0.0 ..." commands will still give the "Cannot assign requested
address" errors, so must be removed). See

- Use my 0.0.0.0 nostalgia patch, from
<URL:
http://www-dse.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dpw/stuff/2.2.0-bootp.patch>.
 It
restores the old feature, so no changes are needed outside the
kernel. It's a convenient temporary measure until fixed
clients/scripts are available.
Hope this helps,
Dave Wragg
