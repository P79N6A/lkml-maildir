Hi,
Are you sure, that your USB-stick is not faulty ?
Could you reproduce it with different piece of hw ?
(Several strange reports for dm-crypt over USB were identified to be 
USB hw faults.)

But no stack trace attached here... please attach it.
It can be known bug which was fixed in stable version some time ago
see

No known bugs causing data corruption, no such reports so far
for stable kernel.
