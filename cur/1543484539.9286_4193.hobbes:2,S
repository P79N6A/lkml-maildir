Well, we might want to invent simplex-PPP. It would be _very_ handy
for IrDA stuff, because we might drop ugly IrDA stack and use simple
ppp.

PS: Unfortunately, inventing simplex-PPP is not too easy. I tried to
do it once, and it worked very slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwly, and I was unable
to debug it :-(. But if anyone is capable of doing so, this might be
VERY nice hack.
