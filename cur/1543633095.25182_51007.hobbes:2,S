If to the general SMP case is added the ability to dynamically enable
and disable cpus at runtime, this infrastructure work appears to have
general applicability now.  Allowing for example dynamic
enable/disable of HT on P4-Xeons at runtime for example.

Thinking in terms of physically hot-plugging cpus has me doubt the
actual utility of this code.  Instead thinking of dynamically enabling
and disabling processors for debugging sounds very reasonable.
But for the latter something just a little more than minimal hacks
must be implemented.  But dynamic cpu enable/disable is definitely
worth it.
