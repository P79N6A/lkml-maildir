Well, CPU_MASK_ALL rather than cpu_online_map, I would think.  That is
what the behavior was before the cpuset merge, anyway.  It might be
the best short term solution, more below...

Yes, but your patch doesn't lock the task itself (unless I'm
misreading patches again).  However, have a look at the comments above
task_lock in sched.h:
/*
 * Protects ->fs, ->files, ->mm, ->ptrace, ->group_info, ->comm, keyring
 * subscriptions and synchronises with wait4().  Also used in procfs.
 *
 * Nests both inside and outside of read_lock(&tasklist_lock).
 * It must not be nested with write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock),
 * neither inside nor outside.
 */
static inline void task_lock(struct task_struct *p)
{
        spin_lock(&p->alloc_lock);
}
Unfortunately, move_task_off_dead_cpu is called from
migrate_live_tasks while the latter has a write_lock_irq on
tasklist_lock.  So we can't use task_lock in this context, assuming
the comments are valid.  Right?
