Hi,
It does annoy me that any 1G i386 machine will end up with 1/8th of the
memory as highmem. A patch like this one has been used in various places
since the early 2.4 days at least, is there a reason why it isn't merged
yet? Note I just hacked this one up, but similar patches abound I'm
sure. Bugs are mine.
