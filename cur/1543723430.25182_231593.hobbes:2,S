Subject: [PATCH/2.4.26] Avoid kernel data corruption through /dev/kmem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm sending this fix for /dev/kmem; I already sent a cleanup about this, but 
since you said "cleanups go in 2.6", then I'm sending only the bugfix.
Bye

We need to check if do_write_mem == -EFAULT.
In fact, without that check, we could execute this:
do_write_mem returns -EFAULT;
wrote = -EFAULT;
buf += wrote; //i.e. buf -= EFAULT (14);
... read other data from buf, and write it to kernel memory
(actually on special circumstances, i.e. p < high_memory && 
 p + count > high_memory).
Luckily not at all exploitable (not even in the OpenBSD idea) since
to write on /dev/kmem you must already be root.
