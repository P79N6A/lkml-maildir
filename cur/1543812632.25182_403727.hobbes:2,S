So that hack apparently improves the bucket distribution quite a bit, but
look, the bad old linear systime creep is still very obvious.  For that
there is no substitute for lots of buckets.
The hash function can be improved way more.  Your resource encoding is
also painfully wasteful.
As for optimizing the loop... most of the loop overhead comes from
loading cold cache lines no doubt.  The struct qstr is an impediment
there because it adds another cache line to every loop.  Speaking of
that, the qstr is so far away from the list.next pointer that you're
most probably getting an extra cache line load there too.  Just move
the qstr up next to the hash list.
Notice, those wildly gyrating real times are still manifesting.  Seen
them over there?
Regards,
Daniel
