IMHO these two lines belong into curr->func, perhaps with a reference 
implementation that uses
struct wait_queue_entry_info {
    wait_queue_t wait;
    struct wait_info info;
};
We have already a callback pointer, so why add special case code into 
the common codepaths? Custom callbacks could handle the special case of 
an info wakeup.
