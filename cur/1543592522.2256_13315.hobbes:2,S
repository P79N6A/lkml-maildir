That's... interesting. With that patch changes to fs/super.c should make
no difference whatsoever.
OK, can you reproduce NFS lockup on 2.4.5-pre5 (without that patch)
and on 2.4.5-pre3 (ditto)? 
There were NFS changes in -pre4 and -pre5 and umount ones in -pre6. The
latter need the patch I've posted, so vanilla -pre5 and -pre3 are the
first candidates for checking.
