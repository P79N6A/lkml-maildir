I had these problems building nvidia driver and vmware drivers today 
after I upgraded to mm4 (with love-sources patchset as well).  I 
traced them down to a single change in the kernel Makefile which, 
after I reversed it, allowed the modules to successfully build (and my 
-mm4 kernel is happily tainted with them right now).
-export MODVERDIR := .tmp_versions
+export MODVERDIR := $(if 
$(KBUILD_EXTMOD),$(KBUILD_EXTMOD)/).tmp_versions
+                .tmp_kallsyms* .tmp_version .tmp_vmlinux*
Likely the problem _is_ nvidia and vmware coders making assumptions 
that they should not.  In any case, I'm glad to see others are 
noticing this problem and it will probably be fixed soon.
This is the sort of error I was getting with nvidia (done manually for 
clarity):
21:45:09 <@root|/usr/src/linux> 
SUBDIRS=/usr/src/archives/nvidia/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-5336-pkg1/usr/src/nv/ 
make modules
< bunch of text... compiling, etc... >
   LD [M]  
/usr/src/archives/nvidia/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-5336-pkg1/usr/src/nv//nvidia.o
/bin/sh: line 1: 
/usr/src/archives/nvidia/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-1.0-5336-pkg1/usr/src/nv//.tmp_versions/nvidia.mod: 
No such file or directory
Similar error with vmware (and I don't feel like going through the 
work of reproducing it atm XD)
Cheers,
Mike
