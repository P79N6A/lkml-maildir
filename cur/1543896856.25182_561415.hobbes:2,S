No, in fact, the mainline scheduler is good only for the very particular
cases you propose here. But on some fairly trivial situations (such as two
processes consuming very close to 50% CPU), it can be a disaster. I've had
proxies under medium load slow down sshd so much that it was impossible to
log in. Most of the worst situations have been fixed since the early 2.6
versions (2.6.11 was still horrible), but it's the general design which
makes such cases hard to find and to fix.
Your situation is clearly something standard where only the user can decide
which application should get more CPU. You start two CPU hogs, and your mind
tells you that you would prefer the video not to skip and the encoding to
finish later. For other people, it might be the reverse because the video
will be there just for monitoring purposes. The nice command was invented
exactly for that, and people have been happily using it for the last 30
years. I don't see why it should become hard to use ! Many CPU-sensitive
applications already provide the ability to change their nice value
themselves using a command line parameter.
And if it is still too hard to assign nice values from within your
environment, then perhaps it's the environment which does not suit your
needs. Even Windows users can choose to assign more priorities to
foreground/background tasks, so it is something universally accepted,
and I would be really surprized that you would not have the ability
to proceed the same way.
