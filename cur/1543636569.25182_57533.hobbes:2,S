This is an official "me too" report - Previous problems with the VIA
chipset and CD-ROMs were reported here:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0205.1/0207.html
The same problems also happen with the VT8233A chipset on my new
motherboard.  Same symptoms as the previous post, same results with
2.4.19-pre2 and 2.4.19-pre2-ac2.
I haven't tried out 2.5.X yet, I suppose I will try it out just to see
if I get lucky.
Anyway, if Andre and others are working other problems, I would be more
than willing to help with this issue (or at least port it back to the
2.4 tree if a fix exists in the 2.5 branch).
All I need is a little direction on where to start looking.
Thanks,
Jordan
