 ian and mark kindly responded pointing out some programs which
 make that possible.

 hi peter, thank you for responding.
 see 
http://hands.com/d-i,
 searching for "xen0".
 the key is to be able to test-run debian installations in
 a xen guest domain (with absolute minimal changes to the
 packages or the debian boot installs).
 and of course a debian install expects to see a hard drive, which it
 expects to be able to partition - so it is given one.
