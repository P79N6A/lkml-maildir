efi_rtc.c just predates genrtc getting into kernel.org, but as it does
come from the m68k folks, it came first :)  WRT gen_rtc.c being killed
off, yes, that sounds vaugly like the MIPS varriant of a generic RTC
driver, which is being killed off (which reminds me of some cleanups
suggested by Jun Sun, *sigh*, so much to do, so little time).
