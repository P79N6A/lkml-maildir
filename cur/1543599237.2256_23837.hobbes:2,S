I might have gone with a dual-proc, simply because they seem to be the 
server config of choice around here, but that may not hold true for your 
own needs.

It gives you a mix of in-memory and on-disk operations.  The on-disk work 
is worth noting -- it tells you how well the FS handles/causes 
fragmentation.  FAT, WAFL, and Tux2, for instance, would probably do very 
poorly on random reads, since they tend to have a lot of fragmentation.  
WAFL and Tux2, on the other hand, should slaughter everyone on random 
writes.
