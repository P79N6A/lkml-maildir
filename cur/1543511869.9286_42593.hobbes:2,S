I think his question is
will there be an IA-64 kernel and a IA-32 kernel. And will
the IA-64 kernel be a 64 bit kerenel ergo a pointer is 64 bits or
will it be an 32 bit kernel that uses IA-64 code. 
This then raises the next question about code compatability:
How will IA-32 code run on a IA-64/64 bit kernel. I know over here
in the alpha world when trying to run 32 bit intel code em86 magles
memory pointers hard and fast. hmmm Sounds to me that a new elf
loader will be shoved into the kernel so IA32 code will
be loaded in a 32 bit window. and The kernel is going to have to map
all pointers headed into user space down. (DMA etc). This is of course
if IA-32 binaries will be supported on the IA64 kernel. Makes me wonder
what windows will do. Lets see they still have 16 bit code in their 32
bit product so now they will add on 64 bit code to???? My guess is they
will use the IA64 instructions but effectively mask out the upper 32
bits of any memory address. 
My 2 cents
