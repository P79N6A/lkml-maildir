It sounds like when you play music very loud with bad speakers
and it's kind of slow. It's kind of "clinking", describing sound via
e-mail can be very hard.
what value shall i put for the clocking parameter?
is it trial-and-error or is there some formula?
And no, the cut off output does not mean that it worked. :(
xmms says this:
Audio device open for 44.1Khz, stereo, 8bit failed
Trying 48Khz, 16bit stereo.
But it still sounds strange.
