I put the log files here:
http://www.cyrius.com/tmp/2.6.22
http://www.cyrius.com/tmp/2.6.23-rc8-sched-devel
I increased the time ipfer ran to 30 secs since your script runs for
over 15 secs.  I got:
[  3]  0.0-30.0 sec    331 MBytes  92.6 Mbits/sec   2.6.22
vs
[  3]  0.0-30.0 sec    222 MBytes  62.1 Mbits/sec   2.6.23-rc8-sched-devel
