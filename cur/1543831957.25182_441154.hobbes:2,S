The most recent version of "gitweb" can actually do this kind of thing for 
you on the web, but the version currently installed on kernel.org only 
does it per-file, not per directory, making it less useful.
I suspect it will get upgraded one of these days, and when it does, you 
can generate the above kind of listing without even having git installed 
by going to
	
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
and then selecting the "tree" view (it defaults to "summary" - see the top 
line that says "summary"/"shortlog"/"log"/"commit"/"commitdiff"/"tree", 
and select "tree" from there). Then you can walk down the tree, and when 
you find the file (or, eventually, directory) you are interested in, click 
on "history".
So even without git, you can get a lot of this kind of information. 
However, with just the web interface, you do lose a lot of browsing 
capability, like browsing multiple files/directories at the same time, and 
doing things like limiting the output since just a particular version.
So you could  just get git on your own, and read the docs, and play with 
it. The place to start is probably the git homepage:
	
http://git.or.cz/
(also look up the Wiki there - click on "Wiki" in the header to see some 
Wiki resources that probably get updated a bit more often than the home 
page itself).
