No.  I'm certain you're right when talking about things like web
serving, but it just doesn't apply when you look at some other
applications, such as streaming out video data or performing
fileserving in a high-performance compute cluster where you are
serving bulk data.  The multimedia and HPC worlds typically operate on
datasets which are far too large to cache, so you want to keep them in
memory as little as possible when you ship them over the wire.
Cheers,
 Stephen
