I've already talked with SiS. They are insisting that they will write the
drivers themselves, they dont want to release datasheets to anyone. The
reply I got (Thu, 25 Oct 2001) they said they are working on OSS drivers
in-house, and ALSA drivers are next.
Of course, who knows when they'll be released.
