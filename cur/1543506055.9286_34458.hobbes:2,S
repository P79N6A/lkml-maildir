From just a quick scan (grep + ocular-investigation), there seem to be at
least a few places left in the kernel where jiffies are treated as int,
not unsigned long. Are those left on purpose, or should I fix 'em up?!
For instance, arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c defines jiffies to be unsigned
int (this would probably not really matter, but for sake of clarity)
