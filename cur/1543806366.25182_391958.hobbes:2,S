Hmm, well the 24 port is listed at 1278, so less per port than the 12
port for sure, but if you only need 8, then well... :)
Of course I doubt there is that big a market for an 8 port NON raid
card, which might explain why there doesn't seem to be any.  Of course
if there aren't any it is hard to have a market exist for them.

Well personally I have never seen more than 4 ports per card on a non
hardware raid card.  That doesn't mean they don't exist, but it makes it
a lot less likely that they exist in my book. :)
