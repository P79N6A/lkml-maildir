Subject: /proc/mounts: two different loop devices mounted on same mountpoint?!

Hi!
Kernel 2.4.17:
pavel@amd:~/misc$ cat /proc/mounts
/dev/root / ext2 rw 0 0
/dev/hda3 /suse ext2 rw 0 0
none /proc proc rw 0 0
none /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs rw 0 0
/dev/cfs0 /overlay coda rw 0 0
/dev/loop0 /mnt ext2 rw 0 0
/dev/loop1 /mnt ext2 rw 0 0
pavel@amd:~/misc$
Both /dev/loop0 *and* /dev/loop1 mounted on /mnt at same time? Oops?
What's the semantics of that? [And I guess it should not be allowed)
