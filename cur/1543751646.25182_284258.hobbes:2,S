Okay, I can buy that there are filesystems, such as pipefs, that
shouldn't be mounted from userland.  I'm wondering, however, why that
applies to rootfs.  Is it a security reason (if it is, why - I'd like to
understand), is it a technical reason to simplify some VFS
requirement/limitation, or was it simply picked because it seemed to
make sense but it could be changed if something else made more sense?
Here's my application:
I have an early-userspace with early init programs and kernel modules.
Hotplug events load drivers and then the early init mounts the real
root.  I want to take the modules from the early-userspace to the real
root by a mount bind of /lib/modules to /newroot/lib/modules.  The mount
bind is the slickest way to do it rather than copying everything from /
to /newroot.  That's where the MS_NOUSER is getting in the way.
I've removed MS_NOUSER from rootfs_get_sb() in my tree and things work
great.  I'm just wondering if this might cause some real, unforeseen
problem or if it's something that might be changed in the main tree.
