Rebuilt the kernel using using 2.4.1 + patch-2.4.1-ac20 :
Initial state is good, and now ping works.  However, if I run IPTRAF, then 
the card grinds to a halt after receiving about 2.6 Mbytes on try 1, then 
11 Mbytes on try 2, after which it will neither receive or transmit :-(
After this the card is in a state such that it requires a reboot to be able 
to do anything further.
