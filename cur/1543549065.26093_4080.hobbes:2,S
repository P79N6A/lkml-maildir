[ext2 errors and fdisk complaints on 2.4.0test8, patched?]
Andre,
(i) Geometry does not play any role in the functioning of Linux -
it is only a matter to LILO and fdisk. So, if you meet
a strange geometry, then that is surprising, but cannot cause other errors.
Of course it is possible that the same bug causes both ext2 errors
and a strange geometry report.
(ii) You find exactly the same fdisk oddities, and exactly the same
ext2 errors on each of four disks. This sounds more like a programming
than like a hardware error, although of course I do not know what kind of
hardware setup you use.
So, perhaps you should explain what you do.
If this is an unpatched vanilla 2.4.0test8 then I am surprised.
But if it is a patched version I would prefer to blame the patch.

Do you have a reproducible situation, with a kernel
that functions and a kernel that fails?
