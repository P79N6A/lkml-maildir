I have asked Venki to do a minimal 'combo' patch that isolates just the 
functional changes. (it is otherwise identical to Venki's PAT changes.) 
The reason why we wanted to re-test the functional changes was that 
Torsten's crash looks very weird: double Call Trace line, a crash in the 
scsi/ata code, showing the after-effects of some sort of memory corruption 
there.
Connection to the x86-fixes patchset did not seem impossible [a theory 
would be: cache aliasing problems causing memory corruption], but 
nevertheless it was all quite weird. So we wanted an isolated repeat test 
for just the functional changes.
The 7 patches lined up for you (but quarantined from x86/urgent for now, 
until the crash Torsten got is investigated) introduce the above condition 
cleanly, as:
+static inline int is_new_memtype_allowed(unsigned long flags,
+                                               unsigned long new_flags)
+{
+       /*
+        * Certain new memtypes are not allowed with certain
+        * requested memtype:
+        * - request is uncached, return cannot be write-back
+        * - request is write-combine, return cannot be write-back
+        */
+       if ((flags == _PAGE_CACHE_UC_MINUS &&
+            new_flags == _PAGE_CACHE_WB) ||
+           (flags == _PAGE_CACHE_WC &&
+            new_flags == _PAGE_CACHE_WB)) {
+               return 0;
+       }
+
+       return 1;
+}
