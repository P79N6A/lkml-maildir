HI,
I was modifying xosview to support I/O statistics (one graph for each
disk?) with new
/proc/stat, but then I saw that on my IDE system this file
was not reporting statistics from all disks.
I have on this system two disks, primary master and secondary master,
hda and hdc.
In /proc/stat
i see just:
disk_io: (3,0):(24382,16849,158610,7533,382512)
so, I see 22,0 disk (hdc) is somehow missing.
If needed I can check on a scsi system with three disks.
bests
Luigi
