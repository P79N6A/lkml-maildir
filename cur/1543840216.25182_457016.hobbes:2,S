A hardware raid controller can buy you a battery backed write cache, so
there are potentially some performance/safety benefits potentially.
We have a mix of software raid and 3ware based hardware raid subsystems.
For the applications we support, in general I can say that performance
was not the discriminating reason to choose one over the other.
