Possible. Another thing to check is if you started using an APM
monitoring program, like the GNOME battery_applet which reads /proc/apm
every couple of seconds. With every read of /proc/apm the APM driver
calls the APM BIOS, which on some systems runs quite long with
interrupts disabled. On my laptop this results in exactly the noise you
described.
