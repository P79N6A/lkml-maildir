arch/i386/mach-generic/es7000.c:37: warning: static declaration of 'mps_oem_check' follows non-static declaration
include/asm/mach-es7000/mach_mpparse.h:23: warning: previous declaration of 'mps_oem_check' was here
arch/i386/mach-generic/es7000.c:50: warning: static declaration of 'acpi_madt_oem_check' follows non-static declaration
