By the way, here's an example where having the /proc interface is a good
thing: which do you use? zip compression, lzf compression or no
compression? Until recently I always used lzf compression. I just
upgraded my laptop's hard drive, and found I wasn't getting the
performance improvements in suspending I expected. It turns out that the
CPU is now the limiting factor. Because I had the /proc interface, I
could easily adjust the debug settings to show me throughput and then
try a couple of suspend cycles with compression enabled and with it
disabled. Without the /proc interface, I would have had to have
recompiled the kernel to switch settings. (I didn't try gzip because I
knew it wasn't going to be a contender for me).
Regards,
Nigel
