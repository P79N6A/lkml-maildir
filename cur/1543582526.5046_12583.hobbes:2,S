i dont like this one. 100 times a second makes absolutely no performance
difference whatsoever - but eg. i'm driving kernel profiling from the NMI
handler to get profiles of eg. IRQ handlers and other cli()-ed code areas.
another reason is that if NMIs intaract with anything else in the system,
we'll have much better chances to hit it with 100 Hz than with 1 Hz.
