Well long and int are the same size on ix86. What you really need
is 'size_t' for counters. That's the largest unsigned integer that
will fit in a register on the target platform. It is platform-
specific, therefore defined in stddef.h. No index or return-value
is supposed to be larger than what can be represented in size_t,
therefore it is a good type to use.
Note that on 64-bit platforms, size_t will be larger than an unsigned
int. This is good.
