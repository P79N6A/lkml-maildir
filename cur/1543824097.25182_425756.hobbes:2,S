Hmmmph.
I get this problem, and always have, but I always put it down to my system.
I run Slackware 10, and this has always happened to me from 2.6.2
upwards on CRT 1024x768 and later TFT 1280x1024 dvi.
I use[d] in lilo:
# VESA framebuffer console @ 1280x1024x?k
vga=794
# VESA framebuffer console @ 1024x768x64k
#vga=791
So you are not alone.
