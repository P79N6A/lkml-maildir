Hello all,
The question I am asking may the simplest of this field, but I found it no where. Pls help.
How to activate X with rivafb framebuffer not the generic fb driver (fbdev).
I am working with the following configuration:-
* Red Hat Linux 7.3 
* Kernel 2.4.18-3 
* Nvidia Riva TNT card 
* Rivafb driver 
* XFree86 4.2.0 
 
My edited the XF86Confoig file as follows( related sections only):-
Section "device"
	Identifier "linix fb"
	Driver "rivafb"	# Is rivafb the right keyword for rivafb.o module?
	BoardName "Unknown"
EndSection
Section "Screen"
	Identifier "Screen0"
	Device "linux fb"
	Monitor "COMPAQ S510"
	DefaultDepth 8
	Subsection "Display"
		Depth 8
	EndSubSection 
EndSection
Is rivafb the right keyword for rivafb.o module?
Is it the driver name(module name) that we should keep in the Driver part of Device section?
If I startx afterb modprobing the rivafb, it results in errors. # startx 
(EE) Fialed to load module "rivafb" ( module does not exist, 0)
(EE) No devices detected.
Please help me in this regard. I have spend good enough time on this and its I high time get it done.
Is it so easy a question? Just becos I didn't find any info about in the internet and no body replies for question.
Aim Behind all this : 
To debug the rivafb driver when it being called or used by X server( XF86 ).
Regards,
Mukund jampala
