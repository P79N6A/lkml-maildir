Subject: [PATCH 06/11] NFSD: Remove NFSv4 dependency on NFSv3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/8/290

Clean up: Because NFSD_V4 "depends on" NFSD_V3, it appears as a child of
the NFSD_V3 menu entry, and is not visible if NFSD_V3 is unselected.
Replace the dependency on NFSD_V3 with a "select NFSD_V3".  This makes
NFSD_V4 look and work just like NFS_V3, while ensuring that NFSD_V3 is
enabled if NFSD_V4 is.
