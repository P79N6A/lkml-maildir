man mt:
       datcompression
              (some SCSI-2 DAT tapes) Inquire or set the compres-
              sion  status (on/off). If the count is one the com-
              pression status is printed. If the count  is  zero,
              compression  is disabled. Otherwise, compression is
              enabled. The command uses the SCSI  ioctl  to  read
              and write the Data Compression Characteristics mode
              page (15). ONLY ROOT CAN USE THIS COMMAND.
Or do you mean that this command doesn't work?
