I don't see how this applies...  Now that I've been educated about how
swap is set up, I see swap already uses the first page for config info
and a signature.  Adding some sort of label or ID to the swap info
wouldn't affect swapping or LKCD in any way because it still wouldn't
go past the first page.
It would already be possible to auto-enable any devices with the swap
signature by doing the same sort of search mount(8) is doing for LABEL
and UUID.  The only drawback would be that you can't specify priority
and usage order, and you can't auto-detect swap files.  Swap files are
not an issue because you can use the file name to locate them.
Cheers, Andreas
