There are many ways of doing this. Several extra streams to a directory
that aren't ordinary files in the directory?
It seems to me that we can get a lot of nice functionality in a simpler way:
Instead of thinking about a number of streams attached to something
that is either an ordinary file or directory, just say that the only
change will be that a directory may have a _single_ file stream in
addition to being a plain directory.
The conceptual change is smaller.  Still you achieve multiple
streams, the "main" stream in such a dir+file is the single stream
attached to the directory.  All the "extra streams" are files inside the 
(normal) directory.
* This way, the extra streams aren't "special" in any way and
  should work fine with existing tools. 
* Serving such a filesystem to clients that use multiple streams
  will allow any number of streams per file for them
* Moving the directory+file thing will move both the directory and
  the special stream, and all the extra streams follow because they're
  �part of the directory as usual�.
If the VFS is to be extended in order to support file-as-directory (or
vice versa) then hopefully it can be done in a simple way.
