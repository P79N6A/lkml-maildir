It is the second :) I was in vacations.

Debugging this type of trouble is not always easy, since it is
system-specific, and probably not directly related to cx88 driver, since
cx88 drivers work fine on several configurations. 
So, we need more details about your configuration. You may try also to
use the latest vanilla linux kernel (2.6.22.1). Maybe this might be an
issue already handled.
You can do a "cat /proc/interrupts". This will help to identify the
shared interrupts and if the processors are balancing the IRQ handling. 
There are some tutorials that may help seeking for a bug:
Documentation/BUG-HUNTING
Also, the file /REPORTING-BUGS, at the main tree contains some
orientations on what kind of information can be retrieved for you to
report a bug.
This can also help you to force the handling of an IRQ to an specific
CPU:
Documentation/IRQ-affinity.txt
