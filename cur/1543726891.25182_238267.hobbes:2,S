I don't think it matters much for the specific goal of getting rid
of regular timer ticks. I expect even a jiffies less kernel to
emulate jiffies using CLOCK_MONOTONIC and some timer for quite some
time. Basically on these kernels it will just be a bit more expensive
too use, but not much.
Of course add_timeout makes a nicer API in general, so it may be 
still a good idea.
