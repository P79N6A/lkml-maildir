This is of course dangerous, since it could create conflicts.
Thus, I suggest we do write new 0x00 markers; even though it's not
required (it only matters if the filesystem is out of spec and
therefore by definition corrupt), it would help the Psion, and
wouldn't cause any problems for in-spec filesystems.
