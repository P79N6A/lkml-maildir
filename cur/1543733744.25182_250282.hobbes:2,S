You  may  want  to  reproduce  that  bug  without  the  nvidia  module
loaded. This doesn't sound like  much, but I even had strange problems
after registering a simple webcam to the kernel which kept it crashing
while accessing  data structures that  have clearly been  there before
(but  yet it  claimed that  the  memory address  wasn't assigned).  It
turned  out that my  customer had  the NVidia  module loaded.  Once he
unloaded it, everything was running fine.
So please consider  a clean boot without ever  loading nvidia, and try
to reproduce the bug.
