Hi Russ,
in case you are still wondering about this...
There is a good explanation of the original reasoning here:
    
http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-bugs/2007-02/msg00149.html
And there are plans to remove the message here
    
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0707.3/2879.html
I am still seeing the warning in 2.6.23-rc3, but it makes no difference
if I specify pci=assign-busses ... everything seems fine either way.
Cheers,
Mathis
