Both git and BK can do this.
Once you know which commit you want to check, the way to find out what the
first release was that contained that commit is perfectly straightforward:  
you take each release, and see if the commit is reachable from that
release. You don't need to actually look at the patches, it's enough to
look at the revision tree.
In Git, you can basically do something like
	for i in $releases
	do
		j=$(git-merge-base $commit $i)
		if [ "$j" == "$commit" ]; then
			echo $commit was in $i
		fi
	done
where "releases" is the list of SHA1 names for the commits of the releases
you're interested in, and "commit" is the SHA1 name of the commit you're 
looking at.
In BK, you can do similar things with "bk cset" (and there's some other
helper things for it too), but I don't have the docs available any more,
so..
In all fairness, usually it _is_ easier to just do a grep for it if you 
already have the release patches available. It's what I usually did 
myself.
