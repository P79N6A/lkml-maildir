Yes. But they should not KNOW. They should call "gettimeofday()" like a
well-written portable program shall, and that call should use the
timestamp IF IT IS AVAILBLE. And with the right scaling, so that there is
never any question of the program running fine on one CPU but breaking
when run on a faster/slower one. Talk about nasty debugging.
And this is exactly why the magical kernel mapping is such a win.
