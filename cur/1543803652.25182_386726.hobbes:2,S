To me it sounds more like you introduced a bug than fixed one.
If MPOL_MF_STRICT and the zero page is found but not in the nodelist
demanded, then it's right to refuse, I'd say.  If Andi shares your
view that the zero pages should be ignored, I won't argue; but we
shouldn't change behaviour by mistake, without review or comment.
