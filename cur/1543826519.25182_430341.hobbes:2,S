Of course I know, but look at this:
# cat /proc/ioports
d000-d0ff : 0000:00:0f.0
  d000-d0ff : via-rhine
e400-e4ff : 0000:00:12.0
  e400-e4ff : via-rhine
# cat /proc/iomem  
de000000-de0000ff : 0000:00:0f.0
  de000000-de0000ff : via-rhine
de002000-de0020ff : 0000:00:12.0
  de002000-de0020ff : via-rhine
from ifoconfig:
eth0: Interrupt:10 Base address: *0xe000*
eth1: Interrupt:11 Base address: *0x4000* <<is it I/O or mem ???
