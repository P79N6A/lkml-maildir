Subject: sk98lin.ko Marvell ethernet gigabit lan fails in 2.6.9, 2.6.8 kernels

SysKonnect Marvell Gigabit lan seems to have been lost in the kernel 
shuffle from 2.6.6 or 2.6.7.
Has the maintainer dropped the ball on this?
The module has never gone through any name change:
/lib/modules/2.6.9/kernel/drivers/net/sk98lin/sk98lin.ko
I have dowloaded the patch from SysKonnect
http://www.syskonnect.com/syskonnect/support/driver/d0102_driver.html
There are instructions for patching the sk98in driver.
I have successfully patched updated the driver and currently have it 
working in 2.6.9
Who is the kernel maintainer for this?  Why hasn't the patch listed 
above and dated October 20, 2004 been incorporated?
Thanks,
RaXeT
