Not answering your question directly, but...
You are breaking new ground by adding MSI support to a driver.  I thank 
you for this -- alot -- but you should realize there will probably be a 
little bit of PCI core work necessary in order to get things the way you 
want them.
Feel free to propose changes to the PCI core to accomodate your MSI driver.
