to quote richard dawson during his soused "family feud" period...
  "survey says:  BZZT!"
the memory store operations required to do LRU list manipulation slow the
search operations down far more than the gains from LRU behavior in the
hash buckets.  andrea showed this in his first LRU page patch long ago.
i also measured a slow-down when trying this methodology in the buffer
cache (getblk()).
the best thing to do is shorten your hash chains.  use a bigger hash
table, a hash function that randomizes better, or a better bucket data
structure.
executive summary:  LRU buckets ain't worth it.
