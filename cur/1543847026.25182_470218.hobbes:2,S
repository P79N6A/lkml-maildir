it breaks suspend when the airo module is loaded:
kernel: Stopping tasks: =================================================================================
kernel:  stopping tasks timed out after 20 seconds (1 tasks remaining):
kernel:   eth1
kernel: Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, eth1 not stopped
if i remove the airo module suspend works normally (this is on a
thinkpad t40).
