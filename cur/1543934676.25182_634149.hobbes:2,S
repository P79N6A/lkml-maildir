    Yep!  Hope that's making it into a patch soon or, at least 2.6.24.
    Kernel buffered
    I seem to remember reading about some problems with Promise SATA & ACPI.
Does this address that or is that a separate issue?  (Am using no-acpi for
now, but would like to try acpi again if it may be fixed (last time I tried
it with this card, "sdb" went "offline" (once it unmounted itself and
refused to be remounted (no error...just nothing), and another it stayed
mounted, but gave an I/O Error...so have been using no-acpi since).
An ACPI error in bootup said:
ACPI Exception (utmutex-0263): AE_BAD_PARAMETER, Thread EFFC2000 could 
not acquire Mutex [3] [20070126]
    Is the above bug mentioned/discussed in the linux-ide archives?  That
and I'd like to find out why TCQ/NCQ doesn't work with the Seagate drives --
my guess, since they say queuedepth of 0/32, is that they are blacklisted
as being drives that don't follow normal protocol or implement their
own proprietary extensions?  Sigh.  Really a lame move (if that's the case)
for Seagate, considering they usage they could likely get in server
configs.  Maybe they want to push their SCSI/SAS drives?
    BTW, can SATA have DPO or FUA or are those limited to SCSI?
Would it be a desirable future addition to remove the
"doesn't support DPO or FUA" error message" on SATA drives if they are
specific to SCSI?
