We do have screens wider than 80 characters, but almost all the time  
I spend in terminal windows, they are set to 24x80 (the default  
size).  It is a matter of habit, and I bet I'm not alone.  Hence, 80  
is "annoying" not only because patches will wrap, but also because in  
some editors the 80th character will also wrap.
Just my 2 cents,
