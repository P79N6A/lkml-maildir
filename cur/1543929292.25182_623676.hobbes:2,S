Both high and low level optimizations are needed for good performance.

A lot of applications don't and the user space networking schemes
tend to have their own drawbacks anyways.

That's not about mouse/keyboard input, but about all X protocol communication
between X clients and X server. The key is not large copies here 
anyways (large data is put into shm) but latency.

That's not the whole story no. Batching etc are needed, but the
faster instruction sequences are needed too.

It depends. Often high level (and then caching) optimizations are better 
bang for the buck, but completely disregarding the fast path work is a bad 
thing too. As an example see Christoph's recent work on the slub fastpath
which makes a quite measurable difference on benchmarks.
