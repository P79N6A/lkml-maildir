libstdc++ is GPL too. Why's that not a problem? Because it has an
exception explicitly allowing you to use it _without_ becoming covered
by the GPL, in certain circumstances. A bit like this one:
   NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
 services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
 of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
Of course, the libstdc++ exception was written a bit more carefully than
ours, but ours seems to be perfectly sufficient.
