"Software" == "3rd-party kernel modules" in this case, right?
Remember what had been told to you about in-kernel interfaces?  That's
right, that they can be changed at zero notice.  Now, if SuSE told you
otherwise, you might have a cause to complain.  Had they?
If they'd promised in-kernel interface stability and lied - sure, go ahead
and nail them to the wall.  If not - STFU and eat what you are bloody given.
Al, not particulary fond of SuSE, but even less so - of misdirecting wankers
like that...
