I don't view the FSF as sort of last instance, but just for the
protocol: The exact wording of this license is labeled 'GPL-compatible'
by the FSF. Imho, this makes it a subset.

Additional coding, no problem, but additional social work, I'd prefer
not to be involved with. As there is no legal requirement, such efforts
would just make a good appearance. But, hey, if someone volunteers to
sort out these problems, my modifications to aes-i586.S can be
relicensed under the GPL anytime, no problem.
