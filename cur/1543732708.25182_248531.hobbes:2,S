That's exactly what folks seem to lost in this debate.
We (developers) want to have files as dirs to:
* be able to extract/modify file part on fly. For instance, simple .iso 
file, without need to mount it over loop (btw, if someone is going to 
redesign VFS, can we handle that kinda case too please?), .tar, or 
unzipped (kernel can handle zips) "streams". File is a stream, why 
shouldn't I have a chance to grab a stream out of archive/image than ?
* be able to store metadata, that doesn't matter on copy, and even 
should not be copied sometimes. Things like thumbnails, metainformation 
(used for search). All of these extracted from acctual file (either by 
VFS 'plugins', or by userspace application), and saved there so that it 
can be used later on. So we save some time on extracting it.
