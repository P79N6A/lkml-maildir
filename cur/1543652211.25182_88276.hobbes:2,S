Subject: [PATCH] use 64 bit jiffies 1/4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/10/4

Hi Linus,
with HZ=1000 even on 32bit platforms, we really should use the
64 bit jiffies value for exported interfaces like uptime, process start
time etc.
Otherwise innocent users might get quite surprised when ps output goes
berzerk after 49.5 days, showing processes as having started in the
future.
Note that the appended patch does not change any of the exported
interfaces, it just avoids internal overflows.
These changes were already discussed on lkml long ago, before George 
Anzinger introduced the current 64 bit jiffies implementation.
In its current form this patch was posted on lkml last month, and has been
in -dj (modulo the HZ=1000 change) since 2.5.20-dj3.

Part 1/4: "Infrastructure"
Provide a sane way to avoid unneccessary locking on 64 bit platforms,
and a 64 bit analogon to "jiffies_to_clock_t()".
Naming it "jiffies_64_to_user_HZ()" is the only part of these patches I 
expect to be controversial.
