There are at least 3 idioms:
1) return 0 on success, -E on fail¹.
	rv = foo();
	if (rv < 0)
		...
2) return 1 on YES, 0 on NO.
3) return valid pointer on OK, NULL on fail.
	p = kmalloc();
	if (!p)
		...
#2 should only be used if condition in question is spelled nice:
	if (license_is_gpl_compatible())
		...
	else
		ATI_you_can_fuck_off_too();
The question is into which category queue_work() fails.

¹ BSD returns E* where E* is negative and thus avoids "return E*;" bugs (where E
  is positive).
