fakeroot makes the working tree files appear to be owned by
root.root but does not know git uses the file ownership
information recorded in the index and uses it to detect if the
working tree is dirty.  Because the index says they are owned by
you (the one who pulled from the kernel.org and owns the files
in the real world not fakeroot world), you get -dirty suffix.
Perhaps "fakeroot -u" would help.
