There's a slew of drivers for ancient hardware in Linux that will /never/
be supported in Windows 2000/XP. Given we also support a majority of modern
hardware, chances are we're either comparable, or maybe even surpassing
Microsoft in terms of number of drivers shipped.

Since when do we load /all/ the drivers ? That would be silly.

I'll hazard a guess this has nothing whatsoever do to with address space sizes.

If we did stupid things like trying to load every single driver, maybe.
But we don't, so I think you're chasing ghosts.
