I haven't ran all of the 2.2.x kernels, but I've ran practically
every 2.0.x kernel, and many of those were with ample RAM and
*NO* swap, with no instabilities.

Why?  I've never encountered this.

I have a 486 set up as a simple firewall gateway with 8Mb RAM,
and no swap.  Runs and runs and runs.  Never had it crash.

Yes, if you run apps that use more VM than you have configured.

Agreed.  For a modern system with lots of disk space, a 124M
partition per drive is an EXCELLENT idea indeed.  I chuck them in
extended partitions though.

I've done it a few times when my system slowed down and I checked
free VM and found it steadily decreasing.  I have a small script
that I wrote, called "aswap" which functions more or less as "Oh
shit, my system is running out of VM FAST!  Make new swap space
as fast as possible on the drive that has the most free space!"
It searches ext2 drives first, followed by vfat, and finally
msdos drives.  Whichever has the most space gets the temp
swapfile.  Works great on the occasions I need it which are rare,
and usually due to a Netscape or KDE memleak.

Unless it's being used to collect 0's.  ;o)
Take care, TTYL
