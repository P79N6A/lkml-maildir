Well, my observation is that both softlockup and the scheduler really
want to measure unstolen time, so it seemed to me that sched_clock was a
nice common place to implement that, rather than implementing a whole
new time interface.  At the time that seemed OK, and nobody had any
objections.
But it's a bit beside the point unless it does turn out to be making
Andrew's Vaio sad.
