...Not sure if you want now to invent such structure. Yes, we have per skb 
->sacked but again in SYN_SENT there are very few things who touch it at 
all, and they just set it to zero (though it would not even be mandatory 
for tcp_transmit_skb, IIRC, checked that just couple of days ago due to 
other things).
Another thing is the rx_opt.sack_ok which is just couple flag bits that 
tell the TCP variant in use (and it's mostly used only after SYN handshake 
completes). The rest (the actual SACK blocks) is in the ack_skb but again 
it has very little meaning in SYN_SENT state unless somebody is crazy 
enough to add SACK blocks to SYN-ACKs :-).

If your symptoms really are: SYNs leaving (if they show up in tcpdump, for 
sure they've left TCP code already) and SYN-ACK not showing up even in 
something as early as in tcpdump (for sure TCP side code didn't execute at 
that point yet), there's very little change that Linux' TCP code has some 
bug in it, only things that do something in such scenario are the SYN 
generation and retransmitting SYNs (and those are trivially verifiable 
from tcpdump).
