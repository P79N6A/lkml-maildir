Using Redhat 6.0 and the 2.2.5-22 kernel, I have a situation
where an IBM Netfinity system hangs a few minutes after
booting.  However, it does not experience this hang when
using the 2.2.11 kernel.  I need to pinpoint the problem
and am looking for ideas.
I've investigated the /var/log/messages and syslog debug
messages, but have not found anything "error" related.  Are
there other error reporting facilities I should be looking at?
Is there a way to force a system dump or stack trace of the
Linux OS at the time of the hang?
What tools exist to debug this type of situation?
(ie. a system hang)
Also, I've been browsing through several of the Linux kernel
web pages looking for bug descriptions that kernel patches address
but have been unsuccessful.  Any pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Ross Mikosh
