Yes, Kprobes code removed it because, by the time this cpu reads the ia64 instruction
to decode the break value,  at the same time on the other cpu, due to unregister_kprobes()
call, this instruction might be replace with the original instruction. Hence the 
reading/decoding the instruction might result in wrong break number. So not a good idea to 
decode the instruction.
