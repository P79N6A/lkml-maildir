/dev/kmem disappears along with all the other bypass routes on a
thoroughly secured system.

We cannot switch *ANYTHING* off for root while retaining raw hardware
access.

I'd use another capability (SYS_DESTROY_HARDWARE) which isn't enabled for
anything by default. Apart from that, it's OK.

We NEED to block this function somehow.

Nope - /dev/kmem is gone.

As above, it's gone.

So long as not having CAP_DESTROY_HARDWARE prevents this, and
CAP_DESTROY_HARDWARE isn't available to anything by default, that's OK.
