Okay, I can confirm that:                                                       
hdparm -c1 -d1 /dev/hda                                                         
/dev/hda:                                                                       
 setting 32-bit I/O support flag to 1                                           
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)                                                    
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)                                                     
 using_dma    =  1 (on)                                                         
hdparm  /dev/hda                                                                
/dev/hda:                                                                       
 multcount    =  0 (off)                                                        
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)                                                     
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)                                                        
 using_dma    =  1 (on)                                                         
 keepsettings =  1 (on)                                                         
 nowerr       =  0 (off)

 readahead    =  8 (on)                                                         
 geometry     = 3737/255/63, sectors = 60036480, start = 0                      
 DMA modes: mdma0 mdma1 *mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 udma5              
hdparm -tT /dev/hda                                                             
/dev/hda:                                                                       
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  2.55 seconds = 50.20 MB/sec            
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.73 seconds = 11.17 MB/sec             
Not a top-notch result, but I guess 440FX just isn't capable of better. In      
any case, that's heck of a lot better that the <3MB/s I was getting in          
PIO mode without the IDE-patch.
