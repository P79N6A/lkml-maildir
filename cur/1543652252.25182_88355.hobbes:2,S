OK, what about the runtime warning with no requirement for a special flag to 
enable attachment.

I don't necessarily agree.  It's easy to miss in all the build noise (most 
average users don't do make -s).  And the warning isn't that fierce (it 
complains about a prototype mismatch), so even if it's noticed, it might get 
ignored.  At least if we have a run time warning, it's in the logs for all to 
see when a problem gets posted to any given mailing list.
