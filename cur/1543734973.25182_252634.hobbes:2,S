Could you explain the interrupt_at function further?

Out of curiosity, what happens in your fsyscall code in these cases
where TIME_SOURCE_FUNCTION is used?

Hmm. This is getting somewhat tangled in my mind. Who is calling tick()
originally? How is event_run being called?

Well, this is still a bit vague.  do_adjtimex gives us 4 values we need
to use in adjusting time. The parts-per-million (ppm - all of which are
signed) tick adjustment value, the ppm frequency adjustment, the ppm
offset adjustment, and the singleshot offset adjustment length (# of
nsecs in which we apply the maximum ppm singleshot offset adjustment). 
How do these 4 values get translated to adjusting the time source?
You might want to just swipe my timeofday-core patch and re-work the
timesource.h interface to your liking (make it like time_source_t). That
way you get all the NTP details as well as the interrupt separation for
free.
