In low memory situations you really want to run the tree compressed.  
ON a fast machine do a "bk -r admin -Z" and then clone that onto your
laptop.  I think that will drop the tree to about 145MB which will
help, maybe.  I suspect that you use enough of the rest of your 200MB
that it still won't fit.
For the checkouts, always do a "bk -r get -S" the -S doesn't check out the
file again if it is already there.  We could make that the default but
it is an interface change.  A fairly minor one though.
We've got some other fixes in the pipeline for the checkin and integrity
check pass.
There is only so much we can do when you are trying to cram 10 pounds of
crap in a 5 pound bag :(
