Sorry, my fault. I remembered that someone must do double buffering. 
I've overlooked that ptrace_readdata does the double buffering.

This patch seems to be wrong.
flush_dcache_page is not a replacement for flush_page_to_ram(): It's an 
optimized cache flush function, only valid for page cache pages:
If a page is mapped only once, then no aliasing can occur and the flush 
is not required.
For page cache pages, "mapped once" is equivalient to an empty 
page->mapping->i_mmap{,_shared}. The pages are mapped once in the page 
cache, and _if_ they are mapped in user space, then 
page->mapping->i_mmap{,_shared} is not empty.
ptrace can be called on random addresses - sysv shm, anonymous pages, 
etc. page->mapping->i_mmap{,_shared} is meaningless.
If you think about it, if ptrace accesses a page, then it's guaranteed 
to be mapped twice: once in user space, once by the kmap_atomic() for 
the kernel space access.
