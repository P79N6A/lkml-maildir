No Arjan, you cannot say that ! (well, of course you can but in this case
you may be wrong). A spec describes any process, whether it's soft or hard,
and BTW, the frontier between soft and hard is diminishing. When I designed
a PI-Bus-PCI bridge 10 years ago, I used PCI 2.1 Specification. And it was
more related to software than hardware (FSMs, config registers, etc...).
It's the *implementation* which is up to us, not the spec. A spec will never
tell you that you have to be compliant with 4k stacks or things like this.
This is implementation. What it tells you is when interrupt X strikes and
you read bit Y from reg Z, then you must reset bit Y before leaving. And this
is software specs, not hardware.

Keeping close to an accepted standard model makes it far easier to upgrade
later, but you're right, the spec does not tell you what your implementation
must look like.
I think we agree but just don't give the exact same meaning to words.
