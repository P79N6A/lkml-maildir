I followed that thread, George, but I think it's a different case with
schedule_timeout() [maybe this indicates drivers/other users should
maybe be using itimers, but I'll get to that in a sec].
With schedule_timeout(), we are just given a relative jiffies value. We
have no context as to which task is requesting the delay, per se,
meaning we don't (can't) know from the interface whether this is the
first delay in a sequence, or a brand new one, without changing all
users to have some sort of control structure. The callers of
schedule_timeout() don't even get a pointer to the timer added
internally.
So, adding 1 to all sleeps seems like it might be reasonable, as looping
sleeps probably need to use a different interface. I had worked a bit
ago on something like poll_event() with the kernel-janitors group, which
would abstract out the repeated sleeps. Basically wait_event() without
wait-queues... Maybe we could make such an interface just use itimers?
I've attached my old patch for poll_event(), just for reference.
My point, I guess, is that in the schedule_timeout() case, we don't know
where the jiffies edge is, as we either expire or receive a wait-queue
event/signal, we never mod_timer() the internal timer... So we have to
assume that we need to sleep the request. But maybe Roman's idea of
sleeping a certain number of jiffy edges is sufficient. I am not yet
convinced driver authors want/need such an interface, though, still
thinking it over.
Thanks for all the feedback,
Nish
