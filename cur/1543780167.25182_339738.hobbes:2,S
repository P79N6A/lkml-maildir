Probably nobody has taken the time to do a diff between the kernel's
current version and the the one distributed by sangoma.
If someone (hint hint) was to do a diff, clean it up to ensure it
matches kernel CodingStyle and standards and then send it in along
with a description of the changes made and why they make sense, what
bugs it fixes etc, then that person could probably get such a diff
merged.
