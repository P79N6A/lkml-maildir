Please pinpoint calls/data structure which you find are complicated.
All the features currently supported are used by some tools and have
been requested by users.

For ABI compatibility between 32 and 64 bits, all our bitmaps shared
with user level use u64. bitmap.h uses unsigned long, so I
cannot use BITS_TO_LONG().
Internally, the bitmap.h macros are used to set/test bits.

Stale comment. I'll fix that.

Not necessarily because the kernel code tends to scan the one bitmask at
a time.

Those are just stats counters used mostly for debugging.

That goes back to the argument earlier about bitmap.h using unsigned long
and not u64. To avoid compiler warning, I used this macro. I do want
to use the bitmap macros (instead of inventing my own). Andrew once
asked if we should not fix bitmap.h instead.

I'll fix that.

There parameter is checked on entry from perfmon syscalls to fail
if necessary. So there can potentially be a race with the perfmon init.
Yet I do not think this can happen with the existing code base.
I'll simplify that.

Are you talking about the overflow of the message queue?

As I said in the documentation, I have created a proof-of-concept patch for Oprofile
to migrate it on top of perfmon on non-Itanium hardware. It needs more work, and I am
hoping someone from the distrro will pick this up and improve it. From the beginning,
I made sure there was enough features in perfmon to support Oprofile and reuse its
kernel code base. The changes to the user level daemon are fairly limited. It was my
goal to ensure that Oprofile users would not see major disruptions. The wording is
the documentation was maybe too strong.

Yes, but that could be leveraged by tools to optimize the number of argument they
want to pass per call.

I could use a % of available memory. Is there another subsystem that ttries to size
its buffer based on available memory at boot time?

Yes, that would probbaably be better. At least, it would fit the exsiting framework.
I'll fix that as well assuming I understand how to create new capabilities.
Thanks for your comments.
