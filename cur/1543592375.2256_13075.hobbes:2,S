I'm not going to apply this as long as it plays experimental games with
"shrink_icache()" and friends. I haven't seen anybody comment on the
performance on this, and I can well imagine that it would potentially
shrink the dcache too aggressively when there are lots of inactive-dirty
pages around, where page_launder is the right thing to do, and shrinking
icache/dcache might not be.
I'd really like to avoid having the MM stuff fluctuate too much. Have
people tested this under different loads etc?
