You can't really do a set_pte_at() in this code path because
there isn't a subsequent flush_tlb_*().
This is needed because some architectures queue up all set_pte_at()
calls until the next flush_tlb_*() in order to batch TLB flushes.
PowerPC and Sparc64 both do this.
The pte_establish() in the existing code works fine because it takes
care of the set_pte_at() and flush_tlb_*() work internally when
necessary on a given platform.
