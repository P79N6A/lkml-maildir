Hi -
Does anyone know what is the status of Ultra ATA 66 support in the Linux
kernel?   I have a Fujitsu ATA 66 drive and a motherboard with the intel i440BX
chip set.  Intel professes that the i440BX chip set is compatible with Ultra
ATA 66 and I am wondering if I can push the bandwidth on the IDE bus this far.
Thanks....
