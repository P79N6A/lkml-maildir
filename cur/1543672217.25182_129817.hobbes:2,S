           Summary: The HTB utility is not working properly using 2.5.68
                    kernel
    Kernel Version: 2.5.68
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: acme@conectiva.com.br
         Submitter: yaronb@warpera.com
                CC: yaronb@warpera.com
Distribution:
Hardware Environment: Intl Pentium-4
Software Environment: Linux kernel 2.5.68
Problem Description: I tested the HTB utility with 2.5.68 kernel, and it
looks  like it doesn't work properly. It works well with 2.3 and 2.4.20
kernels. 
Steps to reproduce:
 Build and install 2.5.68 kernel.
 Create an HTB qdisc, a class with max rate and ceil of 30000Kbit/s.
 Create a filter attached to that class.
 I pushed up to 70000Kbit/s through the filtered interface using the
filterd IP  address, but the Rate limit didn't have any effect. So the
output was  70000Kbit/s. It looks like the HTB functionality is broken.
   Let me know if you need more info.
