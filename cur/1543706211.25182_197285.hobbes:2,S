I (and I suspect a lot of other folks) rather get rid of such autodetect and
move it to userspace. Either via initrd or initramfs.

initrd/initramfs is increasingly becoming mandatory sort of, and it's
actually easy if not even default to set up. (Eg on Fedora / Red Hat even
just typing make install will auto-create this for you)

It doesn't really belong there.[unhandled content-type:application/pgp-signature]
