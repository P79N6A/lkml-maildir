   So in 10% of the cases, two successive calls yield time
   rolling BACK ?
   I used  gettimeofday()  call, and compared the original data
   from the code.
   At a modern uniprocessor machine I never get anything except
   monotonously increasing time (TSC is used in betwen timer ticks
   to supply time increase.)   At a dual processor machine, on
   occasion I do get SAME value twice.   I have never seen time
   rolling backwards.
   Uh..  correction:  216199245  0:-1  -- it did step backwards,
   but only once within about 216 million gettimeofday() calls.
   (I am running 2.4.19-pre8smp at the test box.)
