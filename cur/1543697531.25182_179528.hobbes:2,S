There's a small terminological oddity in that "class" is usually meant
to describe policies governing a task, and "domain" system partitions
like the bits in your patch (I don't recall if they're meant to be
logical or physical). e.g. usage elsewhere would say that there is an
"interactive class", a "timesharing class", a "realtime class", and so
on. Apart from that (and I suppose it's a minor concern), this appears
relatively innocuous.
