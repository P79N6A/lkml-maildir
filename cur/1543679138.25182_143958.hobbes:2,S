Now that's just silly.
The kernel is *how* many megabytes?
And it's very easily available. You may be right, but if you are it's for very 
legalistic reasons that don't matter in real life.
Personally I'd rather download a small patch than a multi-megabyte kernel 
nearly identical to the one I have in /usr/src.
