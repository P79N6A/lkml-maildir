Hi Randy,
Thanks for taking the time to review this.  I get the
impression, though, that the corresponding patch that
creates the 0.5 version of /proc/timer_list is not going
to be accepted.  Perhaps I should strip down this ABI
patch to document just the existing 0.4 /proc/timer_list.
Regards,
Joe
