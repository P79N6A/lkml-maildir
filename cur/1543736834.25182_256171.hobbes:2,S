Hi Andrea,
Java heap is managed by JVM, its address space is reserved upfront
and does not grow or shrink. Our problem is mainly on the stack side.

Should be Ok. But our "fix" only handles heap-stack-gap in a special
case. The problem is we only know the gap size, not its location.
We would have to know if a thread has MAP_GROWSDOWN stack or not to
tell if it has a gap near the stack end. Basically, we assume only
the main thread stack is MAP_GROWSDOWN and every other thread is
created with MAP_FIXED stack (i.e. the gap only exists in main
thread stack). Otherwise we wouldn't be able to tell if a SEGV is
due to stack overflow in the heap-stack-gap or something else.
It's not ideal, but works as long as LinuxThreads or NPTL don't
change back to MAP_GROWSDOWN.

Sorry, I actually meant read _or_ write; that is, disable gap if
prev_vma is PROT_NONE. The heap-stack-gap is essentially a floating
PROT_NONE page. So if you see a PROT_NONE page below a growsdown stack,
you could ignore the gap and allow stack to grow without losing any
protection.

You mean if there's heap memory right below the previously read-only
vma, now it becomes read-write the stack can keep growing down and
it can overwrite heap without a trap? That's a good point. We don't
see that problem because the way we handle stack and heap. But it's
certainly a possibility.

Indeed having a special case for PROT_NONE would complicate the
situation, and it's not that simple as you pointed out.
However, my concern is that a hidden gap floating in memory makes it
very hard to manage stacks, while on the other hand applications
need heap-stack-gap protection could simply call mprotect to
explicitly set up a range of memory as PROT_NONE. I can't imagine
java being the only app out there that needs to handle stack
overflows. Other people could see similar problems too (i.e. SEGV
while cr2 is in the gap, not in the guard page).
Now another wish - instead of a system-wide property, a per-process
mechanism to change heap-stack-gap. Applications that need the gap
can set up the appropriate size, while others like Java that manage
heap and stack can simply disable the gap. Is it possible?
thanks,
