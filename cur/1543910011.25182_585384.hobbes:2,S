atomic_dec() already has volatile behavior everywhere, so this is 
semantically okay, but this code (and any like it) should be calling 
cpu_relax() each iteration through the loop, unless there's a compelling 
reason not to.  I'll allow that for some hardware drivers (possibly this 
one) such a compelling reason may exist, but hardware-independent core 
subsystems probably have no excuse.
If the maintainer of this code doesn't see a compelling reason not to 
add cpu_relax() in this loop, then it should be patched.
