Hi,
I experienced the same problem with ext3 + 2.4.18 on a RAID-1. Out of nowhere 
the following error popped up in the syslog, no other surrounding error 
messages. The fs was mounted read-only automatically. After reboot and fsck 
there were /a lot/ of errors on the disk. Virtually all errors fsck knows I 
think. :)  After fsck ran multiple times on the disk, lost+found was filled 
with stuff from all accross the disk, but other than that the fs seems to 
have survived it.
