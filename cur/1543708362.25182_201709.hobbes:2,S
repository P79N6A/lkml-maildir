2.6.3-mm3 (and 2.6.3-mm1) occationally freeze on "sync".
They will run fine for several days, but if I do a sync
they might freeze completely and sysrq+B is the only action
that gets any response after that.  The mouse stops, the
x clock stops, and so on.
I only saw this once in mm1, and thought it might be some
glitch.  But it have happened several times with mm3,
so I'm reporting it.  It even hapopened when I ran sync
immediately after boot+login (in X) just to test.
I use the ext2 filesystem on two IDE drives.  The
root fs is ext2 on a RAID-1 on the same two drives.
I also mount nfs, but no nfs was mounted when I did
the "sync after boot+login" test.
This is the IDE controller, from lspci:
00:02.5 IDE interface: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5513 [IDE]
I also have proc, tmpfs, devpts and sysfs mounted.
The machine is single-cpu, the kernel is compiled without
preempt and with register arguments and frame pointer,
using gcc 3.3.3 from debian testing.
There obviously were no logs after this freeze.
