It's mostly as I expected...
A couple questions / things to think about...
- I see that you've done away with the old /proc/pci, but have saved
  all the PCI vendor/device ID's, and use them to build device names
  that are now used in the resource tables.  Is this really a good
  idea?  Besides the fact that the string lists haven't been kept up
  to date (the kernel list is less than half of Martin's user-space
  list), do we really want this in the kernel?  I know you have them
  as initdata, but it is still kernel image bloat, and there's also
  the minor issue that any hot swap PCI device can't be named the same
  because the strings will be gone. 
  I'd suggest just naming all PCI devices as "pci <bus>:<slot>.<fn>"
  (for consistency with Martin's lspci) and leaving it at that.  We
  can have a user-space pretty resource printer that cross-references
  the /proc files to get nice device names.  Otherwise, we'll always
  have the hassle of keeping the kernel names in sync with the
  userland names.
- There are PCI devices with additional resources that aren't covered
  by the base address registers.  They can be handled in the PCI fixup
  code, but I'm not sure about where to put their resource structures.
  The devices I know about like this don't use some/most of their base
  address registers, so we could just use those unused structures??
  Or will this cause trouble??
