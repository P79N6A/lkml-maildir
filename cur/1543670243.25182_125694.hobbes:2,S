I think so.  It makes sense to me that we lock an entire cacheline for
this kind of thing.  Indeed, locking a smaller amount would probably break
other stuff.  Remember set_bit() et al take a pointer to an unsigned long...
but can take a bit number > number of bits in an unsigned long.  If anything,
we should maybe expand the range covered by a single lock to a larger amount
than 256 bytes.  How big are ext2 bitmaps, for example?
