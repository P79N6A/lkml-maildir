You know, in such cases usual course of actions is to remove the bloody
thing. It's not used, it's not set to anything useful, semantics is
fundamentally non-obvious, so Occam's Razor applies. Until somebody
comes up with a reasonable use _and_ clear semantics... Trying to invent
one simply because the field is there looks, erm, odd.
