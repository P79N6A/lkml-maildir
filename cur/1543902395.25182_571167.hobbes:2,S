Here are mine; I tried them all, and they always lock into 60Hz refresh.
Mode: 101 (640x480)
Mode: 112 (640x480)
Mode: 103 (800x600)
Mode: 115 (800x600)
Mode: 105 (1024x768)
Mode: 118 (1024x768)
Mode: 179 (1280x768)
Mode: 17b (1280x768)
Mode: 107 (1280x1024)
Mode: 11b (1280x1024)
Mode: 120 (1600x1200)
Mode: 122 (1600x1200)
Mode: 124 (1600x1200)
Mode: 199 (1920x1440)
Mode: 19a (1920x1440)
Mode: 19b (1920x1440)
Mode: 22e (800x480)
Mode: 230 (800x480)
Mode: 108 (80x60)
Mode: 102 (800x600)
What about the VBE 3.0 arbitrary vertical refresh rate thing?
Thanks!
