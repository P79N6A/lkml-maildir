In what I was thinking of, /share/$USER is bind mounted to
~$USER/share, so it would have to be done in a private namespace in
order for deluser to not be tricked.

But it *can* be, if properly set up.  That's part of the point of the
example in the OLS paper.  When a user logs in, sshd clones a new
namespace, then bind-mounts /share/$USER into ~$USER/share.  So assuming
that /share/$USER was --make-shared'd, it and ~$USER are now in the
same peer group, and any changes made by the user under ~$USER will
be reflected back into /share/$USER.

Not necessarily, see above.

Again, I *think* you are wrong that private namespace contradicts this
requirement.
> So both requirements point to the rbind/chroot solution.
It all points to a combination of the two  :-)
