Absolutely.
The fact is, the kernel _cannot_ give persistent names to devices, because
it is simply not a problem that is solvable with the resources the kernel
has access to.
For persistent naming, you need (a) user policy and (b) stable storage,
neither of which the kernel has. 
GregKH has a "udev" setup that plugs into /sbin/hotplug and uses sysfs
to implement stable naming. So sysfs is part of the picture, but it's
not the whole answer.

Right: what you're asking for is persistent per-device user policy.
