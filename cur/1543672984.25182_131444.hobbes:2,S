Hi Andy !
The Problem seems to be that ALSA has moved their devices some weeks ago.
In the alsa-driver-0.9.3a-Package (
ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org
) is a script
called snddevices (attached) which creates the needed devices and links.
Execute it as root and all should be fine ...
Maybe this Script should be distributed with the Kernel too ?
Regards,
	Norbert
