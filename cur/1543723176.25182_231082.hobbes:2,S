Dave, you seem to be arguing "This is how __packed__ works, therefore
this is how __packed__ works, therefore anything else is now how
__packed__ works".  Oliver is trying to propose *new* semantics which
*differ* from __packed__ in a way that seems useful.

Here's Oliver's suggestion, as I understand it:
 - a __nopadding__ struct is naturally aligned for its first member.
 - The compiler does not insert alignment into a __nopadding__ struct.
 - From the outside, a __nopadding__ struct does not differ from a
   normal struct (one lacking all attribute()s), except in its size.  So
   your "struct foo" above (with __nopadding__) would be 7 bytes with
   4-byte alignment for the u32.
As proposed, __nopadding__ is better than __packed__ because leading
correctly-aligned elements can be accessed directly with aligned loads
rather than requiring byte-at-a-time loads on platforms such as SPARC.
To answer your question:  a __nopadding__ struct embedded in another
struct will be naturally aligned just as a normal struct with the same
members would have been.  (Possible variation:  align it as necessary
for the first member, treat the rest as "bag 'o bits".)
It's unfortunate that GCC has conflated several not-necessarily-related
features into a single switch.
 1. no padding between elements
 2. no alignment internally
 3. no alignment externally
This results in confusion, as Scott shows below.  Worse, poorly-defined
semantics are a likely source of implementation bugs -- are you
confident that every aspect of __packed__ works the same in every
compiler that understands attribute((packed))?  Including ICC and
gcc-2.6.0?
