A query-by-example approach is preparsed, unless you want to invent a
complicated language to pack an example into a string.  A vector of tagged
constraint values works better for me.  (I wasn't holding SYS$GETDVI() up
as an exact duplicate of what I am talking about -- it could've been
carried a lot farther.  IIRC F$GETDVI() actually did.  They took away my
VMS system so I can't easily check this.)
Devices are few enough that they can live in a flat namespace, as long as
we can find the ones we want.  There's no parsing in a flat namespace,
only enumeration and lookup.

I'm not objecting to the filesystem here so much as I am the hierarchy.
The problem is that different people want different hierarchies to solve
different problems.  No one hierarchy is general enough to satisfy all, so
I'm asking whether another model *entirely* would be a better fit to the
general problem (that is, the universe of all problems people are wanting
to solve here).
Besides, there's nothing that guarantees a filesystem *must* be
hierarchial.  You could have tagging metadata and a QBE filespec syntax if
you really wanted to.  (I can't yet imagine wanting to.)  Hierarchy wasn't
inherent in the TOPS-10 filesystem, for example; it was grafted in later
because it is, after all, quite useful.  Early MSDOS was the same way, I
believe.
