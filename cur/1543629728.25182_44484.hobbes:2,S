How do I get this information with hdparm please?

hdparm is a tool to query a device and how the controller is programmed to 
talk to the device. But it is not designed nor capable of giving 
information about the host itself. I just read the man page for hdparm and 
there are no options in sight to show any of the things I have shown above.
Also the below work as normal user but hdparm requires super user... It is 
debateable whether a normal user should be allowed access but still you are 
taking away existing functionality...
[aia21@drop hda]$ cat cache
1916
[aia21@drop hda]$ cat capacity
80418240
[aia21@drop hda]$ cat geometry
physical     79780/16/63
logical      5005/255/63
And hdparm never gives you the physical geometry AFAICS.
Either I am missing something or you are removing a lot of functionality 
and replacing it with nothingness...
And as I said, I can understand removing the ability to write values into 
/proc/ide/*, what I disagree with is the removal of the information 
provided by read-only access to /proc/ide/*. And that is because I am not 
aware of any other way to get the same information.
Best regards,
         Anton
