Oxy, excellent summary of the issues relating to the prevention
of exploits, thanks.

What is the level of performance hit, using bounds-checking?

Might there also be an 'alternate universe' where the damage caused
by exploit-induced loss of control could be reduced/limited?
Most of the demons that are exploited are the ones that run with root
privileges (otherwise, it just isn't much fun).  Should mountd, or
talkd _really_ be allowed to stomp /bin/login, modify /etc/passwd,
etc.?  Would finer-grained access control via ACL's and/or capabilities
be the way to go?  Is there a Linux kernel "roadmap" that is taking
development in that direction?  In other words, is there a plan for the
Linux kernel to support mechanisms that would eliminate most of the
dangerous aspects of exploits, even if the did occur?
