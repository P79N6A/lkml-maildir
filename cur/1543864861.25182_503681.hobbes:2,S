True, ratings are constant so the notification never happens (and never
needs to)

I don't know what you mean when you say "no register-notifier interface
is exposed" .. The timekeeping code doesn't use this notification , but
it really should. It's not that big of an issue since we don't have many
clocks in modules..

Indeed . Consider it dropped.

Are you referring to the comments above , or something else your seeing
in the code?
