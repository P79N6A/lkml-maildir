I'd think so, too, but alas it isn't that easy.

Yes, inlined code is slower if the routine is called so often that it
would stay cached between two invocations, and unrolled loops only make
sense for iterative algorithms, where you can fold the instructions
better. Many inlined code in the kernel consists of single
instructions, however, so making them single calls would add much
overhead.
