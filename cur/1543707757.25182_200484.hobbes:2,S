How about this: we clean up dnotify, so it can be used for
user<->kernel dcache coherency, efficiently, and implement O_CLEAN in
a different way, which works with multiple threads, without extra
system calls for rename/link etc. and where the scope of "this
process/thread/whatever doesn't make a directory unclean" is flexible
enough for Samba, multi-threaded file viewers, maildir mail trackers
and so on.
Ok, marketing aside:
    1. open() a directory
    2. fcntl() for dnotify on the directory, as with the current interface,
       but adding a flag call DN_POLL.
Normally dnotify sends a queued signal with each event.  It can listen
in one-short or multiple event modes.  I'm surprised a signal was ever
used, because we have a perfectly good file descriptor to read from.
So DN_POLL means "register this dnotify but don't send a signal".
Instead, you'll call fcntl() again to read the dnotify status bits.
For Samba, the dnotify is equivalent to sys_mark_dir_clean().
Samba's dcache works like this, following Ingo's logic:
repeat:
	if (fcntl(dirfd, F_NOTIFY, DN_CREATE | DN_RENAME | DN_POLL) == 0) {
		... pure user-space fast path, use Samba dcache ...
		return;
	}
	... fill Samba dcache ...
	readdir() loop
	goto repeat;
(Note that DN_DELETE isn't needed: the negative userspace dcache
doesn't care about deletions).
See, that is obviously equivalent and uses an obvious (and tiny)
improvement to the existing dnotify feature.
The argument that O_CLEAN _requires_ sys_mark_dir_clean() is obviously
bogus: if O_CLEAN will abort when _this_ process/thread/whatever has
the directory marked clean, than it can just as easily abort when
this process/thread/whatever has a dnotify listening.
We might, however, like to add a flag DN_CLEAN so that O_CLEAN only
aborts for dnotifies with that flag set.  Just to stay friendly with
libraries.
