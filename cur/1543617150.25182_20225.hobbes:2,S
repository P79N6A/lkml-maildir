Actually, the whole point of Juan's suggestion was that you _don't_ want
to fsck a filesystem that is currently mounted.  There is always a
potential problem that fsck will change the on-disk data of the filesystem
in a way that is not coherent with what the kernel has in-memory, which
should force a system reboot before continuing (which most initscripts
don't do).  For ext2/ext3 this may be relatively safe (data/metadata don't
move around much), but reiserfsck cannot (or will not) fsck a mounted
filesystem at all.
It would be interesting to see if e2fsck could be linked into busybox or
another multi-call binary to avoid the overhead of the static libc linking.
I don't think there are any technical obstacles, just a matter of someone
sitting down and doing it.  It would still be pretty big (150kB or so).
Cheers, Andreas
