Are you sure the mouse is not working?  I also
have a P5A-B, PS/2 mouse and 2.4 kernel (many
versions).  I also get no dmesg about PS/2.  But
the mouse works fine!  Did you tell X windows
that you are using a PS/2 mouse?
In XF86Config (xfree86 version 4):
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Default Mouse"
        Driver          "mouse"
        Option          "CorePointer"
        Option          "Device"   "/dev/misc/psaux" # something else for you?
        Option          "Protocol"   "PS/2"
EndSection
I hope this helps,
Duncan.
