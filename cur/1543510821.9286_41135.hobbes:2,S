The freeque() implementation must wait until all waiting reader threads
have left the kernel:
> while (waitqueue_active(&msq->rwait) || waitqueue_active(&msq->wwait)) {
>         wake_up (&msq->rwait); 
>         wake_up (&msq->wwait);
>         schedule(); 
> }
I've read that calling schedule() could lock up.
What's the exact problem? (I read that  it has something to to with
SCHED_RR threads).
