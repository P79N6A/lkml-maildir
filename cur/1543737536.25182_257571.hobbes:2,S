Hi Linus,
By now it's been an ~8 year relationship between Linux and Tux, but 
Documentation/logo.txt still proclaim the poor bird as the unofficial 
logo. Isn't it about time Tux gained official status? I mean, the bird is 
practically everywhere, and there's no doubt that it's considered the 
Linux logo where ever you go.
You can hardly claim that you have "not really announced it yet" any more. 
I don't know about the paperwork bit, but if that's really something that 
should be done, then how about now for a good time to get it done so we 
can finally proclaim Tux as official? 
I propose the following patch :

 Note that there are black-and-white versions of this available that
 scale down to smaller sizes and are better for letterheads or whatever
Also, on a related note; how about a PNG version instead of a GIF in the 
kernel source? PNG is a nice open format, GIF has this unpleasant patent 
smell...?
