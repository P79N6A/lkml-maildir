Hi,
I found that in 2.5.4-pre1, my joystick (which is connected to my SB
Live gameport) doesn't seem to get recognised by the input layer.
First off, the CONFIG_INPUT_EMU10K1 gets renamed to
CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1 in drivers/input/gameport/Makefile, but not in
.../Config.in.
Having fixed Config.in and done a make oldconfig etc., the kernel
compile seems to go all right, but when I boot from the kernel I'm still
not seeing an input device for it.
That is, where 2.5.3 said
    gameport0: Emu10k1 Gameport at 0xd000 size 8 speed 1242 kHz
    input0: Analog 2-axis 4-button joystick at gameport0.0 [TSC timer, 996 MHz clock, 834 ns res]
whereas 2.5.4-pre1 just says
    gameport0: Emu10k1 Gameport at 0xd000 size 8 speed 1242 kHz
Also, no js0 device shows up in devfs.
Relevant bits of my .config:
$ egrep 'INPUT|GAMEPORT|JOYSTICK' .config | grep =
CONFIG_INPUT=y
CONFIG_INPUT_JOYDEV=y
CONFIG_GAMEPORT=y
CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT=y
CONFIG_GAMEPORT_EMU10K1=y
CONFIG_INPUT_JOYSTICK=y
CONFIG_JOYSTICK_ANALOG=y
Did I miss an option or did something go wrong with the gameport reorg?
Cheers,
Sander
