This one is bogus:
    PCI: Revert "PCI: disable MSI by default on systems with Serverworks HT1000 chips"
    This reverts commit e3008dedff4bdc96a5f67224cd3d8d12237082a0.
    The real bug was an INTX issue in the tg3 ethernet chip, and
    cured by commit c129d962a66c76964954a98b38586ada82cf9381
    Signed-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
    Acked-by: Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@redhat.com>
    Signed-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>
It says "cured by commit c129d962a66c76964954a98b38586ada82cf9381", but no 
such commit exists. What?
Did you mean commit ba698ad4b7e466cbb4a8bde6b9da8080ab06808d, and if so, 
where did that c129d.. come from?
