First time I have had an fs-specific error. Here it is in case this
needs to be studied further:
Feb 10 15:58:36 vortex kernel: Filesystem panic (dev 03:06).
Feb 10 15:58:36 vortex kernel:   FAT error
Feb 10 15:58:36 vortex kernel:   File system has been set read-only
Feb 10 15:58:36 vortex kernel: Directory 7763: bad FAT
Nothing special was going on, I just moved/renamed/copied files as root
on the mount point (mounted as vfat) when this happened. The machine has
been rock stable for a long time (kernel and hardware wise). More
information available on request.
