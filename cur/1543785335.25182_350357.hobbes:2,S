I'm not surprised... With 62 dentrys per page, the likelyhood of
success is very small, and in fact performance could degrade since we
are holding the dcache lock more often and doing less useful work.
It has been over a year and my memory is hazy, but I think I did see
about a 10% improvement on my workload (some sort of SFS simulation
with millions of files being randomly accessed)  on an x86 machine but CPU
utilization also went way up which I think was the dcache lock.
Whatever happened to the  vfs_cache_pressue  band-aid/sledgehammer ?  
Is it not considered an option ?
