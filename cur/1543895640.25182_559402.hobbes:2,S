Actually, it's 0xD.  From the kernel's perspective the mask has been
updated (and I even stuck a printk into set_msi_irq_affinity to verify
that the writes are happening) but ... the hardware doesn't seem to
reflect this.  I also tried putting read_msi_msg right afterwards to
compare contents, though it complained about all the MSIs _except_ for
4341.  (Of course, I could just be way off on the effectiveness of
that.)
