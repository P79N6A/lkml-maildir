Subject: [PATCH] corrupted cramfs filesystems cause kernel oops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Steve Grubb's fzfuzzer tool (
http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/files/
 
fsfuzzer-0.6.tar.gz) generates corrupt Cramfs filesystems which cause  
Cramfs to kernel oops in cramfs_uncompress_block().  The cause of the  
oops is an unchecked corrupted block length field read by  
cramfs_readpage().
This patch adds a sanity check to cramfs_readpage() which checks that  
the block length field is sensible.   The (PAGE_CACHE_SIZE << 1) size  
check is intentional, even though the uncompressed data is not going  
to be larger than PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, gzip sometimes generates  
compressed data larger than the original source data. Mkcramfs checks  
that the compressed size is always less than or equal to  
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE << 1.  Of course Cramfs could use the original  
uncompressed data in this case, but it doesn't.
Patch is against 2.6.19-rc4.
