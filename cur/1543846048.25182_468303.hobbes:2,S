Current linux-2.6.git doesn't build anymore:
   CC [M]  drivers/media/video/zoran_driver.o
drivers/media/video/zoran_driver.c: In function ‘setup_fbuffer’:
drivers/media/video/zoran_driver.c:1519: error: ‘PCIAGP_FAIL’ undeclared 
(first use in this function)
drivers/media/video/zoran_driver.c:1519: error: (Each undeclared 
identifier is reported only once
drivers/media/video/zoran_driver.c:1519: error: for each function it 
appears in.)
Same build breakage in bt484, saa7134.
The PCIAGP_FAIL symbol doesn't exist anywhere.
