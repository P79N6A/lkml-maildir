he's allowing to repeat the loop more than once to hide it, to do the
"mask" with repetition correctly we'd need a per-softirq counter, not
just a bitmask so it wouldn't be handy to allocate on the stack, but
it's nothing unfixable.
However I also preferred the previous behaviour, I think it was much
nicer for general purpose (non specweb99 gigabit like scenarios).

Agreed.

I also dislike it overall but I can see why it improves performance, and
the deschedule thing makes sense for the flooding case.
I would be very confortable in only merging the deschedule part and this
is why I asked Ingo if he could measure the difference.
