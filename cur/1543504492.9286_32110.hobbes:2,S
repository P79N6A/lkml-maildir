In other words, if I do the following on a system with an ext2 root
partition...
 Q> cd /
 Q> touch sample1
 Q> ln sample1 sample2
 Q> rm -f sample2
...I should expect to see both sample1 and sample2 vanish? I think
not.
Personally, I would prefer to see the SAME behaviour regardless of
whether it's on an ext2 partition, a vfat partition, an umsdos
partition or a little-green-men-from-mars-fs partition, and would
consider anything else to be broken.

So, if you telnet into a system you've been given access to for some
contract, and find a document with a hard link to itself under a
different name, do you want the fact that you deleted one of the hard
links to also delete the document itself simply because you forgot to
check what type of partition it was on?

It's not at all hard to do either way, but there are SERIOUS security
implications to the behaviour you are requesting, simply because the
said behaviour would be so different to what happens on every other
file system.

If you want an insecure system, that's your priviledge.
Best wishes from Riley.
