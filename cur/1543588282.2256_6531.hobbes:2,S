Probably would need an incompat flag for changing the inode size anyways,
so old utilities wouldn't set that anyways.

I don't _think_ that there is a requirement for a multiple-of-8 inodes
per group.  OK, looking into mke2fs (actually lib/ext2fs/initialize.c)
it _does_ show that it needs to be a multiple of 8, but I'm not sure
exactly what the "bitmap splicing code" mentioned in the comment is.
In the end, it doesn't really matter much - if we go with multiple-of-2
inode sizes, all it means is that we may need to have multiple-of-2 (or
possibly 4 for 512-byte inodes in a 1k block filesystem) inode table
blocks in each group.  Not a big deal.  The code already handles this.

I can write a few words as well.
