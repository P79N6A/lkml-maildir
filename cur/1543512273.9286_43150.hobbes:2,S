I suspect I am not the only one who has been entirely put off to devfs by
the behaviour of Shawn Leas.  The kernel is a technical issue, and this
should be a technical mailing list.  Shawn has turned devfs into a pissing
contest.  The only argument for devfs that seems to have come out of this
is "You don't have to use it!"  Unfortunately, it affects too much of the
code for that.  Shawn's arguments remind me of a Usenet argument I had
once in which I got so carried away with the argument that I just kept
making sweeping statements regarding something about which I was
completely ignorant.  I look back on that now and feel like a moron.  I'd
like to see a good technical discussion of devfs instead of this crap.
