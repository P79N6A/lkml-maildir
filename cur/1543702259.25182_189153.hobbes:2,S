Hi!
I have a SB16PNP on which alsa under kernel 2.6 fails to detect the OPL
chip, I have tried the 0.9.7 version wich comes with the kernel (up to
version 2.6.1-rc2) and now even alsa 1.0.0rc2 compiled for the 2.6.1-rc2
kernel, on both I get the same result:
sb16: no OPL device at 0x388-0x38a
this is the full output on version 1.0.0rc2:
Starting ALSA (version 1.0.0rc2):pnp: Device 00:01.00 activated.
ALSA /usr/src/modules/alsa-driver/alsa-kernel/isa/sb/sb16.c:489: sb16: no
OPL device at 0x388-0x38a
 sb16.
Alsa version 0.9.8 works perfectly under 2.4.X.
Don't hesitate to contact me for any other info that may be needed to track
this.
Regards...
