I believe I have mentioned the type safety as a positive, and in fact
it's quoted above. I just didn't think it necessary to use quite as
many words explaining it until now.
The negative is the sheer number of helper functions in list.h. Personally,
I find it difficult to retain a working knowledge of them. Iterators are
particularly nasty that way. I'm thinking about dropping all of these
list_for_each_with_murky_argument_requirements_and_odd_side_effects()
and use plain for(;;), as a courtesy to someone who has to read the
code years down the road.
