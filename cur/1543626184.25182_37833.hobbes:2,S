Bad news, everyone. I'm definitely able to reproduce the very same fatal oops
on a UP kernel as well. Couldn't find a SPARC32 equivalent of i386's "nosmp,"
so I was forced to recompile the kernel (2.4.18-rc4) with CONFIG_SMP undefined
and do a "serious test" anyway.
Running something like the following kills the machine flat:
#!/bin/sh
i=0; while [ ! "$i" = "500" ]; do
	/bin/echo testmail.| /bin/mail -s test autoreply@localhost
	i=$(/usr/bin/expr $i + 1)
done
For a ksymoops decode of the oops in question and more, please look up my
former post in this thread.
Looks like it's back to 2.2 for all SPARC/Linux users for the time being.
