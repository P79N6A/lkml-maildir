Depending on the quantity of work that you're trying to do at once, this
might be unavoidable.  
I know it's a difficult thing to think about, but I still don't
understand the precise cases that you're concerned about.  Page faults
to me seem like the least of your problems.  A bigger issue would be if
the page is written to by userspace after you copy, but before you
install the new pte.  Did I miss the code in your patch that invalidated
the old tlb entries?
