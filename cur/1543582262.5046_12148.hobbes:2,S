That's not good.  Which compiler did you use to compile the kernel?  This
sounds lame, but reiserfs exercises the cpu/mem more than ext2, so we hit
bad ram more often.  If we run out of other things to try, please run a
memory tester.

Where in the libsample.so file are the differences (what byte offset?).
Are they restricted to a given range, or do they vary randomly?

At least the patch didn't make it worse.  Would anyone care to comment on
how the elf-dynstr-gc option changes the file access patterns for the
compile?
thanks,
