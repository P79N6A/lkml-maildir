But this comes down to how much time does it take for two threads
to perform some synchronization operation so that they know that one
thread made the call before the other[1]?  I think that it might be
possible to make the claim[2] that we have synchonized the ITC values
more closely than the fastest user synchronization method ... hence
a simplistic kernel implementation will be monotonic in practice.

[1] It is pointless to expect one return value to be greater than
another unless we know that the calls were made in a particular sequence.
[2] Hands are waving so wildly here that it is a wonder that I can
even type.
