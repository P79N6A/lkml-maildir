I'm sure you do, I've read your postings on various SCM mailing lists.
You'll have to get your test data elsewhere, sorry, we're not in the
business of helping you develop a competing product.  Using BK to do
that is a violation of the free use license and I'm sure you are aware
of that.

Nonsense!  It's the information put in there by BitKeeper.  The BK2CVS 
export is an almost perfect mirror of what you'd get if the developers 
were using CVS or Subversion or whatever.
