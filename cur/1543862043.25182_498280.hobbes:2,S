The main kvm ioctl switches the execution mode to guest mode.  Just like 
a syscall enters kernel mode, ioctl(vcpu_fd, KVM_VCPU_RUN) enters the 
guest address space and begins executing guest code.
I don't see how to model that with sysfs.
There are other objections as well. sysfs is a public interface, whereas 
kvm is a process private attribute.  These objections don't apply to 
/proc though.
