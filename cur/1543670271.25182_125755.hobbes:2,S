Yes, I don't think this would be that tough to add.  Matthew Wilcox
posted a patch to clean up a lot of problems with the current binary
file sysfs interface, and after that patch is in the main tree, it
shouldn't be that touch to change to support these kinds of files.
Although I do like the idea and implementation of fwfs, nice job :)
Hope this helps,
