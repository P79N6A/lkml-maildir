I'm going to run these patches by Alan first anyway, so...
BTW, most of partitioning patches apply to both branches - it's preliminary
cleanup part that is tricky; some of partitioning stuff is already in Jens
code and the rest will be a matter of not moving add_gendisk()/del_gendisk()
in 2.4 branch and leaving the calls of grok_partitions()/wipe_partitions()
in ide_revalidate() (2.4) while removing them in 2.5.
Cleanup that comes before that stage is common for 2.4 and 2.5, makes sense
in both and will be synced with Alan - if nothing else, to keep PITA for
Jens minimal.
Look at the patches for other drivers - gendisk splitup / removal of
BLKRRPART handling / removal of ad-hackery in open/reread partitions /
removal of grok_partitions() and wipe_partitions() is fairly small
_if_ driver has clean rules for places where it used to register disks.
That's the main trouble with IDE for my current purposes - and fixing it
makes sense for 2.4 as well as for 2.5.
