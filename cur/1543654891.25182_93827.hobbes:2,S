Hi,
I've been running into problems with my machine locking up in X but
however I have been unable to diagnose it because the Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
key sequence kills my whole machine (i.e. powers it down).
I've done some searching on google but haven't been able to find any
references except a one errata note for Mandrake that mentions disabling
the APIC which I tried and had no effect.
The Ctrl-Alt-Backspace sequence will power down my machine at any point
(BIOS Self-test, Grub, Console mode or X) but doesn't to it once Windows
is running. I have a suspicion that this is ACPI related but even with
acpi=off and apm=off flags is can still stop the box which can't be
right. Any pointers? I stand ready to provide any additional data.
