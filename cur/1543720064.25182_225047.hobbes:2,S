JFFS2 is included in the standard kernels IIRC, however I'd recommend
using the CVS version from the official repository as there are huge
improvements in there.
To use it on a non-MTD[1] device you will need an emulation layer,
the pseudo Block-MTD device. And you will need some additional partition
using ext2/ext3/reiserfs/FAT containing the kernel for your Grub/LILO
bootloader.
