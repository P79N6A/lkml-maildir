Hello!
I've applied your patch and thankfully the bug was triggered on the
next shutdown (after I had installed the new kernel on the first
workstation).

I doubt that. It appears that the bug is triggered somewhere in this
sequence:
K10arpwatch@
K10fbset@
K10powersaved@
K10running-kernel@
K10sshd@
K10update-client@
i.e. after (during) arpwatch shutdown, and before update-client is
run. The latter is an administration script which performs some
lengthy operations on mounted filesystems (fetch updates for packages
and configuration files from a central location).

Dec  2 17:03:11 kermit arpwatch: exiting
Dec  2 17:03:12 kermit sshd[4564]: Received signal 15; terminating.
Dec  2 17:03:12 kermit kernel: __d_path: skipping NULL vfsmnt
Dec  2 17:03:22 kermit kernel: path: `'
Dec  2 17:03:22 kermit kernel: device eth0 left promiscuous mode
I bet an empty string isn't quite helpful here, or is it?
I'm not quite sure how to proceed now. I'd like to try out 2.6.10rc2
as Alan Cox proposed + maybe we could get some more useful information
out of __d_path
Kind regards
