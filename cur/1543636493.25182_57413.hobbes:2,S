Three points:
- with strict overcommit and the "allocations must meet backing store"
rule (policy #3) the above can never use all physical memory
- if your point is that a rogue user can use all of the systems memory,
then you need per-user resource accounting.
- the point of this patch is to not use MORE memory than the system
has.  I say nothing else except that I am trying to avoid OOM and push
the allocation failures into the allocations themselves.  Assuming the
accounting is correct (and it seems to be) then Alan and I have
succeeded.
