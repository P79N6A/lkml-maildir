Subject: [PATCH: 1/2] [SERIAL] avoid waking up closed serial ports on resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

When we boot, serial ports remain in low power mode until they're
used either by userspace or for the kernel console.
However, if you suspend the system, and then resume, all serial ports
will be taken out of low power mode.  This is bad news for embedded
devices where this can mean higher power consumption.
Only bring a serial port out of low power mode if the port is being
used as the kernel console, or is in use by userspace.
