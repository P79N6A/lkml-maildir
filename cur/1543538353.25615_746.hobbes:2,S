Yes, it is a hot plug API issue: the mechanism for passing the device
name to user space got broken.

The PCMCIA base layer wants to allocate all the IO resources for the
card before the driver gets control, to avoid races between when the
resources are assigned and when the driver might get around to marking
them as in-use.  The best thing is to not check the exit status of
request_region().
