It sounds good in theory.  In practice, though, almost all of the
design discussions have been occuring in private e-mail.
For example, I have seen none of the messages discussing
the changes planned for the power management stuff in 2.5,
even though these changes will apparantly touch every single
modular driver.  I know for a fact that the changes planned
to enable better implementation of PCMCIA support have
gone on between only a few developers.  Also, from the
announcement from the Security Module folks, I gather that
there discussions haven't been held on LKML and aren't
planned to migrate here.
So, if you really think that all these module-related design
discussions should happen on LKML, we're going to have
to convince a bunch of people to move their discussions
here.  This will not necessarily be easy.  I know that the
reason that many of these discussions occur between only
a few people is that these folks want a decent signal to
noise ratio.  That's why I proposed a "2.5-module-devel"
list.  It would allow people who really care about this stuff
to coordinate their work.

Well, I'd say it's more like 250-750/day.  :-)

Well, there are probably two sets of audiences.  The initial design
teams, who need to collaborate and the modular driver developers.
The driver developers could come into the loop later, if they please.
Although there would be value in their contribution earlier on.

Well, I'll do that, if a few people say they'll move their design
discussions there and out of private e-mail and other lists.
