I see what's going on ... pci_read_bridge_bases() returns immediately
because this is the root bus.  So we need to point the root bus resources
elsewhere ...  this looks doable.
But I do think insert_resource is the right call to make.  If the device has
the wrong resources, that means something's gone awfully wrong earlier in
the pci code.
