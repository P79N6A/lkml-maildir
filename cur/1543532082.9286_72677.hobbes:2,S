but it's your process that is page-faulting. And killing the other

you're just saying that since you showed concern about your swap usage,
the kernel should treat you as priviledged. It's easier with a DONTKILLME
flag.
Why don't you mlock() a piece of RAM (you're going to know if it's available
at mlock() time), so you never page-fault, and use it just a as cache
for your on-disk data?  With a mlock()ed stack, and being careful using it,
you're 100% safe.  The problem is how to mlock() the stack.
