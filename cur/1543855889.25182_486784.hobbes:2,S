I finally got it working, even though I don't understand at all. :)
I realized that after paging mode is turned off, 0x1000-0000 is actually
at the same flag 4G code segment as caller code.  So I tried to just
"call" and that worked.
Here is the excerpt of the related code in case someone else needs to
do the same:
In arch/i386/kernel/machine_kexec.c:
extern void do_os_switching(void);
void os_switch(void)
{
        void (*foo)(void);
        /* absolutely no irq */
        local_irq_disable();
        /* create identity mapping */
        foo=virt_to_phys(do_os_switching);
        identity_map_page((unsigned long)foo);
        /* jump to the real address */
        load_segments();
        set_gdt(phys_to_virt(0),0);
        set_idt(phys_to_virt(0),0);
        foo();
}
In arch/i386/kernel/acpi/wakeup.S:
        .align  4096
ENTRY(do_os_switching)
        /* JSUN, 0x11 was the boot up value for cr0. */
        movl    $0x11, %eax
        movl    %eax, %cr0
        /* clear cr4 */
        movl    $0, %eax
        movl    %eax, %cr4
        /* clear cr3, flush TLB */
        movl    $0, %eax
        movl    %eax, %cr3
        movl    $0x10000000,%eax
        call    *%eax
I have a second Linux kernel loaded at 0x1000-0000.  Now the only matter
remaining is to figure out why the tsc timer stopped working ... :)
Cheers.
