Hmmm, I gave you every opportunity to back off your pretense
of writing code for the IBM/PC before it existed. You insisted
upon continuing your diatribe. You are the one with the attitude
problem. FYI, the last COMPLETE BIOS I wrote is on-line at:
http://www.AbominableFirebug.com/Sources/pbios.zip
It was written seven years ago. The first one I helped write
was written 36 years ago. I do know something about this stuff.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
