Several allocators already do that (including GCC's), but Glibc doesn't
AFAIK.

There are lots of custom malloc libraries.  If you're going to teach
Glibc something anyway, why not add a new mmap flag?
One flag I think would be quite useful is MAP_NOCLOBBER|MAP_FIXED: there
are times when I'd like to be able to _try_ mapping something at a fixed
address, but fail if there is something mapped there already.  Currently
it's necessary to parse /proc/self/maps, and that's far from thread
safe.
The obvious use is for pre-relocated shared libraries, which can run at
any address but will load faster and share more pages if loaded at a
specific address.  (Especially if they're non-PIC).
As a natural extension, a map flag which says "try to map at the
supplied address, but if there is an object there search for a big
enough hole above the supplied address" would simultaneously be useful
for malloc optimisations like you're suggesting, and pre-relocated
shared libraries.  That would be MAP_NOCLOBBER without MAP_FIXED.
