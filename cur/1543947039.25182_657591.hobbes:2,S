Ah, yes.

Okay, that sounds right.

Oh yes, you did.
I see a possible problem in device_resume().  My copy isn't fully 
up-to-date, but it looks like you call unregister_dropped_devices() 
before doing the up_write(&pm_sleep_rwsem).  Won't this cause 
warnings in device_del() about a suspicious caller?
