Wow... I never thought of that.  Cool!
My main concern is the DoS of multiple kmallocs.  Alan Cox suggested
tying it to an fd (ie. naturally limited), and I think this might work
(I don't know much about async io).  ie. (int)utime is the fd to wake
up, and then it can be used for async io OR a poll/select interface
using existing infrastructure.
Probably it has to be a special fd (/dev/futex?).
Thoughts?
Rusty.
