well i guess we agree that the hard part is to find the problem that
causes the missed bh :-) fixing it sufficiently is a different matter.

(William isnt using SMP and i was suggesting a quick hack for him to try

you have missed the _real_ reason why the above 'bug' was there. It's a
feature and prevents denial of service attacks. Especially wrt. networking
it's very easy to flood a box with bh traffic, and if we are not careful
then slower systems (routers) can effectively be locked up just by
bombarding them with small/tricky packets. So we were always intentionally
trying to guarantee that bhs do not get rerun infinitely.
