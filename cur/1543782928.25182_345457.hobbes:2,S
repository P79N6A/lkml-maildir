No, not at all. :)
I'm suggesting that the rpaphp code has a struct pci_driver whose
id_table and probe function are such that it will claim the EADS
bridges.  (It would probably be best to match on vendor=IBM and
class=PCI-PCI bridge and let the probe function figure out which of
the bridges it gets asked about are actually EADS bridges.)

Those devices can still be isolated and reset, can they not?  And they
still have an EADS bridge above them, don't they?  Are there any that
can't be dynamically reassigned from one partition to another?  I.e.,
they may not be physically hotpluggable but they are still virtually
hotpluggable as far as the partition is concerned, IIUC.
Paul.
