Actually, it's horribly dirty, but I do something similar, except in order to
allow non-root users to do scatter-gather DMA I just modify and restore the
current->cap_effective during the IOCTL call which (among other things, like
creating linked lists containing physical addresses and sizes and doing several
sanity checks) locks the memory.  I really hate doing this, but at least for my
driver it shouldn't be a problem, as if a user has access to the vxi hardware
they can easily defeat all system security (as opposed to merely locking down a
couple of pages of memory), and thus it's safe to assume that only trusted users
have such access.  I would think long and hard before I did something like this
with any other driver, and hopefully I will be able to replace it with a cleaner
implementation in the near future.
