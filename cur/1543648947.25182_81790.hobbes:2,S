I have a bunch of patches under test which do that.
The tricky bit is that at present, the per-cpu data for all 32
CPUs is always allocated.  We had to change that to only allocate
the secondary CPU's memory when the CPU is coming up.
This means that:
	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++)
		play_with(per_cpu(something, i));
becomes a bug.  Because the per-cpu memory for not-possible
CPUs is not allocated.  I created a `for_each_possible_cpu(i)'
helper macro for that.
Another issue:
	/* this is basically for_each_possible_cpu() */
	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {
		if (cpu_possible(i)) {
			play_with(per_cpu(something, i));
		}
	}
the above code will fail if it is run before smp_init(), because
smp_init() sets up cpu_callout_map() and the per-cpu memory.
We (Dipanker and I) fixed up all the callers.
The code works OK, on ia32.  But we think ia64 needs more work.
That's 128k saved.  There's another 128k-odd in a huge hashtable
in kernel/pid.c (even on uniprocessor) which needs a diet.  Also
80k or so in runqueues.  The runqueues are set up before smp_init(),
but I expect a cpu notifier and some reorg there will work.  Haven't
done sched.c yet.
I suspect we waste more memory than this in dynamically allocated
hashtables and mempools though.
