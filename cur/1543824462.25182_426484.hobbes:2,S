Not going to happen at this stage I believe, while people are in NIH
mode against trying to fix the current system, we are not going to
merge a third incompatible graphics layer into the kernel, we have
enough of them to do the job, we need people to fix the current crap
not add more.
The current system is fixable, we've discussed how to fix it a number
of times, however there have never been resources to do it, we
explained to Jon on a number of occasion how we as the maintainers
felt it should be fixed, the patches he produced didn't follow the
direction we wanted, he stated "the writer decides", we stated "the
maintainers don't accept it".
Step 1: add a layer between fbdev and DRM so that they can see each other.
Do *NOT* merge fbdev and DRM this is the "wrong answer". They may end
up merged but firstly let them at least become away of each others
existence, perhaps a lowerlayer driver that handles PCI functionality.
All other Step 1s are belong to us.
I could even drop the last hack I did in some sort of patch form
somewhere, I might even have a git tree (not sure...)
Dave.
