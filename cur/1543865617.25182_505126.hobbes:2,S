I wonder if there's anybody that can help me. Sorry if posting to wrong 
group.
I have RH machines setup in LAN, each is NFS server and client.
All are SMP with sata HDDs
Some about server which hit the problem most of time
http://www.intel.com/design/servers/boards/s5000PSL/index.htm
2 * Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU            5160  @ 3.00GHz
16GB ram
2.6.9-42.0.3.ELsmp #1 SMP Mon Sep 25 17:28:02 EDT 2006 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
exported via nfs is separate filesystem (exporting mountpoint)
ext3 filesystem placed on raid0 array with 6 partitions on different 
drives
The following happens 
nfs server logs
find_exported_dentry: npd != pd
client gets stale nfs file handle and logs
NFS: Buggy server - nlink == 0!
nfs_fhget: iget failed
listing on client side shows broken (sym)links for a while, and then all 
is back fine.
I don't know how to solve it. Any help appreciated.
