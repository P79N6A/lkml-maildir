I dislike surgery and especially without anesthesia, and frankly, I didn't
even have had a single look at the specs of this kind of stuff. May-be,
the protocols are not too unsafe. I will read hot-swap PCI as soon as I
will have time for (I just downloaded all the latest PCI specs for free
some days ago, thanks to the stupidity of some system administrator that
made readable the directory that hosted the spec. documents :)

Having to deal with nasty situations due to useless complexity does not
seem nice to me.
Dynamic loading of kernel modules is for sure a facility for packaging and
distributing commercial O/Ses, drivers and other kinds of kernel objects.
Technically, it is just unsafe bloat and useless complexity, in my
opinion.
