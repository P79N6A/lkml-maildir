This language constitutes conversion and violates about a dozen laws in 
a dozen states. This whole recipricol rights
grant language would have to be litigated, and I don't think anyone will 
know the outcome. I think it would end up
with the Judge saying "You guys take your stuff and go, and you GPL 
people take your stuff and go, and neither one of
you can distribute the others IP".
