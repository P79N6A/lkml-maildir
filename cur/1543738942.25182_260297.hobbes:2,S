Does it _affect_ those instructions, or does it simply wait until those
instructions have completed?  And how does the processor know, when it
executes the barrier, which pending reads will be depended on (and so must
be completed) and which won't?
The impression I get from what you wrote below is that the barrier
instruction causes the processor to abandon all speculative reads until
any already-issued reads have completed.  Isn't that essentially the same
as saying that no speculative (i.e., non-constant) read can be moved back
past the barrier and that the barrier won't finish until all
already-issued reads have completed (in other words, these reads can't be
moved forward past the barrier)?

Okay, I get it.  The example would be even clearer if you stipulate that 
initially q = &b; that would give the CPU a good reason for speculatively 
fetching the value of b.
This seems like a devilishly easy sort of thing to overlook!
