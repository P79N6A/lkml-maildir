Yes, that is indeed how most drivers work. It's both cheaper and faster
to keep the list than allocating and initializing it every time. With
the current termination bit approach, only that bits needs to be
set/cleared to properly terminate the sgtable. So it's free, since it
happens with setting page/length/offset.
