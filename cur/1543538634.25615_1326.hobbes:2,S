Hi,
More testing has revieled that something strange happens...
(as always) as patched on test3-pre6 will try to patch on
a newer (or older more stable) kernel tonight.
X craches when I fire up Netscape and hovers the mouse over
the "shortcut" area... (Bus error)
I have got segmentation faults with
 time stress_diskread
And it is time that cores...!!!
It is like the page is indicated as read - but then it is
gone...
