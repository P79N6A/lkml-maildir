Certainly, changing malloc() so it, in Java parlance, "raises an
exception" (i.e. signals the process "something's gone pearshaped
here") would help. The number of apps which call malloc(), get zero,
then try reading from or writing to their nice new buffer at address
0...
Handling one signal is a lot easier than checking every single return
value from every single call, which is what you would need to handle
OOM properly otherwise...
