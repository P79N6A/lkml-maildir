 Nice joke, but I'll answer seriously.  No support was provided.  Hooking
a PC/XT keyboard to the 8042, if supported, requires a different setup of
the command byte and is possibly done by the system firmware.  You can
read the command byte to see which configuration is used.
 Wrt polling vs IRQ-driven probing and setup: using IRQ is a natural
choice as you have to do keyboard detection in the IRQ handler anyway to
properly support hot plugging of a PC/AT or a PS/2 keyboard.
