I don't know about this separate version of the controller, but the
integrated versions of the 29160 work with the aic7xxx controller. There
was some discussion a while back about the "rebuild firmware" option
during kernel config, I suspect on regular and current kernels it is not
needed; it was, however, required on some of the XFS patched kernels. Is
the "N" version the 32 bit pci version (as opposed to the 64 bit pci
slot versions)? If it fails to work, I'd wonder more if it is a pci
setup issue than aic7xxx.
