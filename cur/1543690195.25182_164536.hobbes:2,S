Well... that wouldn't help with off-tree drivers...
What I mean here is that our PCI driver API defines save_state, we shall
either "support" it some way, or get rid of it completely... but then we
lose the ability to move a PCI driver back & forth with 2.4 ... (do we
care ?)
If you prefer just fixing those 4 ones, then let's get rid of the
save_state field in pci_driver completely...
Ben.
