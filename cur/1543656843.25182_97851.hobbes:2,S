I think it would be better to make NMI and Debug trap use task gates,
if that does actually work, and let the NMI and debug handlers fix the
stack if they trap in the entry paths.  They are much rarer after all.
My unreliable memory recalls about 40 cycles for an MSR write on my Celeron.
However, I think you still need MSR writes _sometimes_ in the context
switch to disable sysenter for vm86-mode tasks.
Could the context switch be written like this?:
	if (unlikely((prev_task->flags | next_task->flags) & PF_SLOW_SWITCH)) {
		// Do rare stuff including debug registers
		// and sysenter/syscall MSR change for vm86.
	}
	// Other stuff.
