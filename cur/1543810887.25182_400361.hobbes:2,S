Your patch doesn't seem to be inline, so I can't quote it.  Several 
problems: on 64 bit platforms you introduced 4 bytes of padding into 
buffer_head.  atomic_t only takes up 4 byte, while size_t is 8 byte 
aligned.  This is a waste of memory, imo, seeing as the vast majority 
of systems out there will not be doing 4GB+ ios any time soon.
Also, the cast to unsigned long long for size_t is pretty atrocious.  
Cast to unsigned long if anything, as size_t is unsigned long on all 
platforms linux runs on.
