There was a bunch of discussion of this, possibly on this list, and I
believe that the whole cable has to be unregistered or some such. I've
done it with only one drive on a cable, and it seemed to work. On the
other hand I was only playing.
I've seen some note regarding using ide-floppy for the whole drive instead
of the media, but I have never had the urge to try that.
WARNING: removable and hot swapable bays are not the same, had a client
prove that to herself the hard way.
