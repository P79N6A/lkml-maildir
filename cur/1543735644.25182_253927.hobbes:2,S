Hi Len,
  I am resending the following set of patches which support ACPI based physical 
CPU hotplug for IA64 platform, after having including all the community 
feedback(of course I got very thin feedback) which I got on 
acpi-devel mailing list.
This set of patches has been tested on linux-2.6.9-rc2. Also this time I am 
cc'ing ia64/lkml mailing lists as patch 3/6 and patch 4/6 touches arch specific files.
Details:(Applies cleanly onto linux-2.6.9-rc2)
Patch[1/6]- Core ACPI enhancement support
Patch[2/6]- ACPI hotplug eject interface support
Patch[3/6]- Arch specific support for mapping lsapic to cpu
Patch[4/6]- Dynamic cpu registration and unregistration support
Patch[5/6]- Extend ACPI processor driver to support Hotplug
Patch[6/6]- ACPI container driver(New driver)
Please consider applying this patch onto your test tree.
Thanks,
Anil S Keshavamurthy
