OK...
a 'tar xvfz myFile.tar.gz' results in the following in /var/log/syslog
May  1 05:58:11 mnemosyne kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address 00000000
May  1 05:58:11 mnemosyne kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 01e55000, %cr3 =
01e55000
May  1 05:58:11 mnemosyne kernel: *pde = 00000000
however this time I'm using a different file.  I can however sucessfully
do the following
	gzip -d ; tar xvf myFile.tar.gz
Don't know if that gives anyone any hints...  I haven't changed any
software on the system recently so I don't think it can be a bad tar or
gzip binary.  I get the same for root and non-privileged users.
thanks again.
