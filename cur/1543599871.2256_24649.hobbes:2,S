I don't know of an actual example.  This one is made up:
       min (int, len, big_size)
Now if big_size has unsigned type, and does not fit in the range of int,
this expression will return the value of big_size cast to int, i.e. a
negative value.  The suggested warning would catch this potential bug.
I don't know if it would warn for too many other things.  Certainly, a
sizeof() exception (don't warn about signed comparison with sizeof()
result) is essential; perhaps too many other exceptions are required
too.
