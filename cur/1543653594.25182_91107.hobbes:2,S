Sure, the bios has this option (and it works). I just believed the 'noht' 
option would disable it from a kernel perspective. I understand that if 
the MP table lists 4 processors, the kernel must think it is 4 processors 
and enable them. But what is the purpose of the 'noht' option ? If it is 
to avoid scanning the ACPI table for CPUs, wouldn't it be less confusing 
to call it something like 'acpismp=disable', since you apparently can't 
disable the siblings anyway (when they are also listed in the MP table) ?
