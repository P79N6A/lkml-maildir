Hi,
i have been faced with a very wiered problem. I have set up a testbed
consisting of a 2 hosts and 1 router (all linux boxes). The router has 2
interface cards and both have different subnet addresses and the router
has been configured to route packets between the subnets. The 2 hosts have
different subnet addresses and route packets to each other via the
router(gw). They are all connected thru the same physical hub though !
The problem is that the ping works fine from host1 to host2 but from
host2 to host1 it only works after the arp cache in all the 3 machines
have got updated with the hardware addresses. it doesnt work otherwise.
could anyone have a clue what the problem could be ??
The answer could be related to the fact that on the router one of the
interface address that i am using for routing is configured as an alias.
I would also appreciate if someone could point me out to any bugs that
have been reported in IP Aliasing in kernel 2.2.2. Thanks a lot.
Regards,
Hormuzd.
p.s. more details of my configuration are as follows :
Ping works fine from 10.1.10.1 > 10.1.11.1 but does not work from
10.1.11.1 > 10.1.10.1 "without updated arp caches".
