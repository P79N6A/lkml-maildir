I understand your point, but we shouldn't trash existing bits either. Things are a bit different with embedded
stuff, and especially in case of 8xx, there are targets without OF-powered uboot. Bootwrapper thing might be helpful in resolving it, but not a holy tablet after all.
The main point is: current 8xx pcmcia code is a holy mess of ifdefs, direct immr accesses (assuming it is io_block_mapped 1:1) etc. And limiting pcmcia to 885ads only (the only 8xx that supports OF so far) is not good.
We have to admit, that many 8xx boards will remain in ppc/ for a while, and instead of just dropping BSP bits
I'm going to let them be refactored via pdevs (with announcement in feature removal reference) as it would take couple of hrs only. If nobody will care, then the whole 8xx pcmcia driver will be cleaned up and switched 
to of_device.
Does that make sense?
