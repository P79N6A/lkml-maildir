The queues are per node which means that pages from which we allocate are 
distinct per node. As long as processes allocate and free object on a 
single node all is fine. Problems can arise though if objects are used 
across node. The earlier incarnation of SLAB had a single global queue for 
slab pages and objects could be allocated from an arbitrary processor. 
Objects from the same page were allocated from all processors.
