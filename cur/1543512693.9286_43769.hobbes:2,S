   Except for, apparently, the people who write kernel code:
    (edited dmesg output)
	.
    hda: HITACHI CDR-8130, ATAPI CDROM drive
	.
    SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 8925000 [4357 MB] [4.4 GB]
    SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 8467200 [4134 MB] [4.1 GB]
	.
    Partition check:
     sda: sda1 sda2
     sdb: sdb1 sdb2
	.
    lp1 at 0x0378, (polling)
	.
    tty00 at 0x03f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
    tty01 at 0x02f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
    tty03 at 0x02e8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
	.
    eth0: DEC 21040 Tulip at 0xdc00, 00 80 c6 03 6e 9b, IRQ 10
	.
   If my scsi disks are /dev/scsi/disk/0, /dev/scsi/disk/1, /dev/scsi/disk/2,
   I'll still need to do mapping between this kernel-provided namespace
   and my namespace to make sense of the kernel messages.   If, as there is
   when I'm running a 2.3.x kernel, a devfs present, the existance of this
   namespace would does not invalidate my custom namespace, except that I
   can then do similarly to what Solaris and Irix do and convert
   /dev/scsi/disk/0 into a symlink to /hw/sda
   To do any sort of device notifier, whether it be devfs or the
   unworkable devd kludge, there needs to be a kernel namespace.  We
   already have two of them (the human-readable names listed above and
   the major/minor black magic that's the traditional Unix approach),
   so the badness of them is not a given.
                 ____
   david parsons \bi/ without a namespace, it's really hard to talk to
                  \/                                          anything.
