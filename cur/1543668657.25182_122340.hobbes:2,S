So, does the shell run successfully, or does the kernel still hang?
If the shell runs successfully, it's an init problem.  If the kernel hangs,
it's probably a kernel problem.

OK...

So, if your init works fine with 2.4.x, why are you assuming that it's
likely to be an init problem when a 2.5.x kernel doesn't boot?  I thought
maybe you were having specific problems that suggested that init might be to
blame.

Eh?  What are you basing that on!?  I'm not agitated at all.

Errr, no.
