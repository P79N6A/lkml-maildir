Are those casts neccessary?

Could we get better names? PCIOB is cryptic, pci_io_base is pretty
good.

Not sure how this is supposed to work. If you assume unshared
interrupts, it should be possible to return something and make core
care.
If you are assuming shared interrupts, either you should disable on
first 0xFFFF (are you sure cast is needed, btw?), or not at all,
because it could be the other device sedning you 100 of those...
...so which one is it?
Is some locking needed around *hw?

-ENOMEM would be more usual calling convention.

Hiding structs BehindTypedefsIsEvil.
