I guess I would prefer it to go under CONFIG_DEBUG_VM. Speaking
of which, it would be nice to be able to turn that on unconditionally
in -rc1. Although I may have put a few too many things under it, so
it might slow down too much...

Yes, but IIRC I put that in because there was another check in
SLES9 that I actually couldn't put in, but used this one instead
because it also caught the bug we saw.

This was actually a rare corruption that is also in 2.6.21, and
as few rmap callsites as we have, it was never noticed until the
SLES9 bug check was triggered.

Hmm, I didn't notice the do_swap_page change, rather just derived
its safety by looking at the current state of the code (which I
guess must have been post-do_swap_page change)...
Do you have a pointer to the patch, for my interest?
