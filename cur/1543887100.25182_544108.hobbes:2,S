get/put_hot_cpus() was intended to be similar and not same as
get/put_cpu().
One difference is get_hot_cpus() has to be a blocking lock. It has to block 
when there is a cpu_down/up operation already in progress, otherwise it isn't 
of much help to serialize readers/writers. Note that a cpu_down/up is marked in 
progress *before* the first notifier is sent (CPU_DOWN/UP_PREPARE) and not just
when changing the cpu_online_map bitmap.
Because it can be a blocking call, there needs to be associated
machinery to wake up sleeping readers/writers.
The other complication get/put_hotcpu() had was dealing with
write-followed-by-read lock attempt by the *same* thread (whilst doing
cpu_down/up).  IIRC this was triggered by some callback processing in CPU_DEAD 
or CPU_DOWN_PREPARE.
cpu_down()
 |- take write lock 
 |- CPU_DOWN_PREPARE
 |        |- foo() wants a read_lock 
Stupid as it sounds, it was really found to be happening!  Gautham, do you 
recall who that foo() was? Somebody in cpufreq I guess ..
Tackling that requires some state bit in task_struct to educate
read_lock to be a no-op if write lock is already held by the thread.
In summary, get/put_hot_cpu() will need to be (slightly) more complex than
something like get/put_cpu(). Perhaps this complexity was what put off
Andrew when he suggested the use of freezer (

I remember Rusty had a similar function to check for unsafe references
to cpu_online_map way back when cpu hotplug was being developed. It will
be a good idea to reintroduce that back.
