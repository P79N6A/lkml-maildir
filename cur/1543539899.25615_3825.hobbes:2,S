for all my tests (past/present/future) assume 
 EIDE DMA=on , unmask irq=on 32bit access=on 
I do not care about untuned , non-DMAed IDE disks, because these are not
the typical machines of the power desktop multimedia machine.
The user who wants low latencies is willing to buy non-flawed hardware.
Bloating the kernel to deliver good latencies on old, slow polled devices etc is
simply silly.
