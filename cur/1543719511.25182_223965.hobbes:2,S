Fair enough.
The old DOS fdisk uses INT13/AH=08h exclusively.  And I have used DOS
fdisk many times on many machines to partition a drive and then
install Windows.  So I am fairly confident that the geometry provided
by INT13/AH=08h (the "legacy INT13 interface") is the one the Windows
boot loader likes to see in the partition table.  This is the geometry
I use in my project, and my users have reported zero failures so far.

Cool.  Sorry if my earlier tone was overly harsh.

It is true that EDD 3.0, which allows you to map reliably between BIOS
disk numbers and physical hardware devices, is not always available
(see 
http://linux.dell.com/edd/results.html
).  But the legacy geometry
is always around, and the EDD module will make it available even if
full EDD support is not present.
The only tricky part is doing the BIOS->Linux disk device mapping.  It
sure would be nice to have that written well once so that each of the
installation systems could re-use it...
