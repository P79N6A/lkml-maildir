it's only an if(unlikely()) branch in a 1:4096 slowpath to handle this, so
why not? If it couldnt be done sanely then i wouldnt argue about this, but
look at the code, it can be done cleanly and with very low cost.

we want the default to be low, so that compatibility with the older SysV
APIs is preserved. Also, why use a 128K bitmap to handle 1 million PIDs on
a system that has at most 1000 tasks running? I'd rather use an algorithm
that scales well from low pid_max to a larger pid_max as well.

why? For most desktop systems even 32K PIDs is probably too high. A large
pid_max only increases the RAM footprint. (well not under the current
allocation scheme but still.)
