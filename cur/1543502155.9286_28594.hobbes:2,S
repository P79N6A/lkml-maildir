Extended attributes are stored using the same schemes as data.
Small ones often go in the inode, larger ones are stored in
data blocks.

No. Attributes are associated with the file, not the containing
directory.

No. "Traditional" attributes are stored in the inode.

attr_get(2)

Nope. The stat family does that.

One syscall.

Buffer allocation is left to the caller. The attr_list(2) call
will tell you what attributes there are, and what their sizes are.
