The lists don't match up with reality very well. It looks like
you are effectively expecting this:
   When 2.4 is released, all linux-future subscribers suddenly
   switch over to linux-kernel. At this point in time, Linux 2.5
   discussion suddenly becomes on-topic for linux-kernel.
(and where does Linux 2.4 maintenance discussion go?)
If we had linux-24@vger.redhat.com and linux-26@vger.redhat.com
then there wouldn't be such a problem. Inactive subscribers go
away too -- but give warning for the archive sites of course.
