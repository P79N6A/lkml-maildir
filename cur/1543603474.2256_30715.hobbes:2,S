The tulip driver only started working for my DLINK 4-port NIC
after about 2.4.8, and last I checked the ZYNX 4-port still refuses
to work, so I wouldn't consider it a paradigm of
stability and grace quite yet.  Regardless of that, it is often
impossible to trade NICS (think built-in 1U servers), and claiming
to only work correctly on certain hardware (and potentially lock up
hard on other hardware) is a pretty sorry state of affairs...
