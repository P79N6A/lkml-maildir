Absolutely.  And I admire your (and Roman's) bravery for trying the
general case.

(Well, MOD_INC_USE_COUNT is already deprecated, mainly because it's
used to try to control module counts from within, which preempt makes
really hard).
Yes, the addition of "umount -l" is congruent to "rmmod --wait".  The
assumption is "I don't want any new users, and I'll handle any current
ones".  You can get yourself in trouble with both of them.
Keep up the good work,
Rusty.
