Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following patches are included:
  * x86: fix cpu_mask_to_apicid_and to include cpu_online_mask.
	Fixes potential problem when destination apicid of an
	offline cpu is returned.
  * x86: use possible_cpus=NUM to extend the number of possible cpus.
	This conforms with the existing s390 argument.
  * cpumask: add sysfs displays for configured and disabled cpu maps
	Display both the configured kernel_max cpus (NR_CPUS-1) as well
	as the cpus in the system that are disabled because they exceed
	the NR_CPUS limit.
Based on tip/cpus4096 + .../rusty/linux-2.6-for-ingo.git/master +
	 x86-only-patches sent 12/15.
