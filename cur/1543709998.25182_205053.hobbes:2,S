Maybe you want to try a little IO latency measurement program to see if the
skips are beeing caused by disk/ioscheduling delays, it's in:
http://pedro.larroy.com/devel/iolat/
Here: 
http://pedro.larroy.com/devel/iolat/analisys/
are some measures from an ide disk in a AMD-768 chipset and a scsi
cheetah 10K on an AIC-7892A U160/m.
I'm still working to find why those delays in the ide disk.
Regards.
