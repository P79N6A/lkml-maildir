On Itanium (and I suppose on x86), ACPI theoretically tells us enough
that we don't need to assume any legacy resources.  Of course, Linux
doesn't listen to everything ACPI is trying to tell it.  But that's
a Linux deficiency we should remedy.

This doesn't feel like the right solution.  Since firmware tells us
whether the device is present, I think we should rely on that.  If
you want to use the device before ACPI is initialized, *then* you
should pass a "kdb_use_keyboard" sort of flag.
