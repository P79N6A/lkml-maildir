Hi,
I haven't been paying much attention, but someone changed the 
mmap_kmem function in drivers/char/mem.c (it used to be equivalent
to mmap_mem). 
I used to be able to use the "chipmunk" tool (www.bitwizard.nl/chipmunk)
to examine and control memory mapped devices

cave chipmunk/chipmunk-1.5# 
but on 2.4.21: No such luck.... It seems there is a new codepath for 
mmapping "kmem", which interferes with chipmunk mmapping the memory 
mapped IO space of the card. 
Why was this added? How does X still work?
