Netscape has to get a license to export their browsers because they
contain crypto code.
I read the regulations once to see what kind of crypto I could put into
a piece of software and not have to get an export license.  I thought
there was some provision for being able to export things with less than
a 40 bit key.  I was wrong.  You have to get a license to export ANY
crypto code.  If you use less than a 40 bit key your chances of getting
a license are improved, but you still have to get one.
