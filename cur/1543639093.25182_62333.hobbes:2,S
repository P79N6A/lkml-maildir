Well, this is the way it's been working on all UN*X platforms I know. In
fact, we came across this problem with NFS clients being unable to
synchronize on Linux. 
If this is a "feature", it makes it impossible to read/write files via NFS
because of the risk of corruption - or am I missing something here?
Also, integrating Linux into heterogeneous networks becomes impossible
(though, it doesn't work in Linux only network as well).
Best,
Giga
