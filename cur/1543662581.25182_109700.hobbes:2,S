If /dev/watchdog is a link to a sysfs file, then (at least in sysfs's
current state) you loose the ability to handle the documented watchdog
ioctl's.  That is why I assumed that the watchdog base.c could implement
a miscdev registered for the watchdog minor (130), and then translate
the documented ioctl's into the watchdog_ops calls for the the specific
driver that is currently associated with the miscdevice.
Or... are you suggesting the ioctl interface is deprecated and
/dev/watchdog/ is a symbolic link to a given watchdog driver directory
in syfs?
