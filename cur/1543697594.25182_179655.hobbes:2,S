Why is the additional variable "kicked" in 2.6 necessary?
Appears that kicked == (cpucount + 1), and the loop already
compares that to NR_CPUS via max_cpus:
                if (max_cpus <= cpucount+1)
                        continue;
Though I think it would read more clearly this way:
                if (cpucount + 1 >= max_cpus)
                        break;
Speaking of max_cpus, it would probably be a good thing if maxcpus() did
not allow the administrator to set max_cpus > NR_CPUS at boot time.
cheers,
