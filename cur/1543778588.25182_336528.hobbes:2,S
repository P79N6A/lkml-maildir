Hi Andrew.
I was not able to get anything when I press this key sequence.
I checked my sysrq key with showkey -s as this doc
(
http://snafu.freedom.org/linux2.2/docs/sysrq.txt
) says and I could
confirm that alt+sysrq is sending 0x54.
I also noted that many said that this option has to be compiled in
kernel, but I couldn't find this option.
Can you give me some tips?
Thanks in advance.
