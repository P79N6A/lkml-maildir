This is nonsense.
Mdadm creates those nodes automa[tg]ically - man mdadm, search for --auto.
Udev has exactly nothing to do with mdX nodes.
In order for an md array to be started up on boot, it has to be specified
in /etc/mdadm.conf.  With proper DEVICE line in there.  That's all.
If you're using raid0 on top of two raid1s (as opposed to using raid10
directly - which is more efficient and flexible), the DEVICE line in
mdadm.conf should be either `partitions' (usually preferred way), or -
in case direct device list is specified - should contain both real
disks AND the raid1 arrays.
But in any case, this has exactly nothing to do with kernel.
It's 100% userspace issues, I'd say distribution-specific issues.
