Yep it does ;-( IA64 relies exclusively on ACPI for irq routing and on
x86 you are seeing more and more hardware that requires it as well,
notably Sony laptops such as the R505 series will not see interrupts
assigned to their cardbus bridge without ACPI interrupt routing.
As for downsides, take a look at the ACPI spec and judge for
yourself. I'll refrain from commenting ;-)
Cheers,
Jes
