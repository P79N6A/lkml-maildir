I've been reading the documentation to nmap 
http://www.insecure.org/nmap
 
and they mention linux a coupple times.
Just 2 questions:
In the first section why are we diffrent?
And in the second why is 2.1.x less random than 2.0.x ?
Here are the relevent 2 paragraphs:
Type of Service -- For the ICMP port unreachable messages I look at
   the type of service (TOS) value of the packet sent back.  Almost
   all implementations use 0 for this ICMP error although Linux uses
   0xC0.  This does not indicate one of the standard TOS values, but
instead is
   part of the unused (AFAIK) precedence field.  I do not know why
   this is set, but if they change to 0 we will be able to keep
   identifying the old versions _and_ we will be able to identify
   between old and new.
and also: 
TCP Options -- These are truly a gold mine in terms of leaking
    information.  The beauty of these options is that:
    1) They are generally optional (duh!) :) so not all hosts implement
       them.
    2) You know if a host implements them by sending a query with an
       option set. The target generally show support of the option by
       setting it on the reply.
    3) You can stuff a whole bunch of options on one packet to test
       everything at once.
    Nmap sends these options along with almost every probe packet:
    Window Scale=10; NOP; Max Segment Size = 265; Timestamp; End of Ops;
    When you get your response, you take a look at which options were
    returned and thus are supported.  Some operating systems such as
    recent FreeBSD boxes support all of the above, while others, such
    as Linux 2.0.X support very few.  The latest Linux 2.1.x kernels
    do support all of the above.  On the other hand, they are more
    vulnerable to TCP sequence prediction.  Go figure.

As a computer I find your faith in technology amusing.
