Dwayne,
Why don't you get with the C++ guy on the list talking about C++ kernels,
Eray Ozkural (erayo@cs.bilkent.edu.tr) and the two of you design a processor
that's optimized to run C++ with 0 overhead memory protection (3 clocks max
to go through a ring 3 -> 0 gate).  Who knows?  Maybe you could design 
a new processor for us to use that just implements two super RISC 
instructions, 'set bugs off' and 'do what I'm thinking'.
:-)
