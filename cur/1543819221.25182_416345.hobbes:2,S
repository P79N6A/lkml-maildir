With smpnice, if we make any wrong decision while moving the high and
low priority tasks, we will enter an endless loop(as load balance
will keep on showing the imbalance and move_tasks will always move
the wrong tasks, instead of the correct ones pointed by imbalance..)
With the current code in the mainline, we don't have such a problem.

I will take a loot at those patches.

I think we can have a second pass(if the first pass fails to move any),
in which we will not skip those tasks which will become highest priority
on the target runqueue...

Thats messy for sure and that was introduced by you to fix an imabalance
issue for a simple DP system(with out breaking HT systems). I will post a fix
for that.
