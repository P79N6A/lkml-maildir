Please see if you like Gunnar Ritter's "nail" mailer in version 9.24 or
newer (11.1 is current), it has the POSIX mailx user interface to begin
with, but supports MIME (hence we'll read J�rg rather than J\366rg or
JXrg or J?rg) and inserts In-Reply-To: and References: headers on
replies. Best of both worlds: You keep your interface, LKML keeps its
threads.

I've set Reply-To and Mail-Followup-To to divert replies to this mail
off the list.
