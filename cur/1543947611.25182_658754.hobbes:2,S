Thanks, applied. 
With this, I also find that I dislike the use of suspend/resume for 
freezing for STD a lot less. It's still too easy to get confused, but at 
least now drivers always have total knowledge about what is really going 
on. I'd not like this interface as a driver writer, but now it's not 
fundamentally broken any more, just slightly confusing.
