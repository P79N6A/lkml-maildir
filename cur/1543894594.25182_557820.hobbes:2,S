but the GPLv3 definitely takes action against Tivo. It's not "defensive" 
in any way. It is outright hostile, it irreversibly cuts off certain 
people from being to distribute GPLv3-ed software alongside with certain 
types of hardware that the FSF's president does not like. (who, 
incidentally, is a mathematician who last wrote significant free 
software perhaps a decade ago, and who thus must have a great and 
thorough understanding of how hardware and software works today and who 
must also have a deep knowledge about what makes the free software 
community tick.)
The GPLv2 never did this kind of restriction _of other works_. Yes, you 
can use copyright law to control other works and thus (if the affected 
work is a hardware device for example) to control the _use_ of the free 
software, but it is _wrong_. The GPLv2 specifically said, in section 0:
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.
guess why this section has been completely removed from the GPLv3, 
without a replacement?
