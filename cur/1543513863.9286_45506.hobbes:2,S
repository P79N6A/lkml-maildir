Subject: how much stack space can I use

SEMMSL and SEMOPM are limited by stack space:
sys_semctl() needs sizeof(short)*SEMMSL bytes
	(up to 1 Kb)
sys_semop() needs 6*SEMOPM bytes.
	(up to 600 bytes)
How much stack space can I use without causing a stack overflow? None of
these functions are recursive, and they don't call any subfunctions
which need more than a few bytes stack space.
Is alloca(3) possible/allowed?
