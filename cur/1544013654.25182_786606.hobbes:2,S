I have a qemu/images directory full of various OS images for testing purposes.
I just fired up my jeos 7.10 image to make sure that even the most stripped-
down version of Ubuntu ("just enough operating system) still installs bash by 
default, and it does.  (It doesn't install a development toolchain, but it 
does install bash.)
I also installed a 32 bit xubuntu 8.10 image (which took 4 hours for some 
reason, and which also has bash), and explicitly tested its 32-bit 
"/bin/dash", and that did 64-bit math too.  So current versions of dash do 
offer 64 bit math on 32 bit platforms.
