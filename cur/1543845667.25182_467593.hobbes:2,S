  It does not matter... The ordering of locking matters, ordering of
unlocking does not.

  Yes, it does. Because the buffers are locked *and dirty*. Nothing can
clear the dirty bit while we are holding the lock and
journal_dirty_data() also waits until it can safely write out the buffer
- which is after we release the buffer lock.

  Yes, but this happens only after the buffer is removed from wbuf[] as
I explain above.

  This actually happens in my fix too. And my fix has also a bonus of
fixing a few other flaws... Otherwise your patch seems to be right.
