May I make the suggestion that instead of creating a new flag (i.e.
NFS_MOUNT_NONRESERVED) and using a new bit in the flags field of struct
nfs_mount_data, Andi use the already existing and unused NFS_MOUNT_SECURE
assuming that is what was originally intended for this bit.  This would
also match in name with the secure/insecure export option on the server.

Hi Andi,
  I've already got a patch to accomplish most of this in
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.21
/linux-2.4.21-11-fix_tcprace3.dif
It's a backport of some patches that have already gone into 2.5.x to
fix some TCP client reconnection issues. I was hoping to push these
patches to Marcelo for 2.4.22.
Could you therefore please just send me a patch for the
NFS_MOUNT_NONRESERVED mount option alone. Then I'll append it to this
patch series?
This should also make it easy to port the whole thing forward to 2.5.x
(although please note that for 2.5.x I'm also planning some other
improvements that will allow us to share the struct xprt between
different RPC clients).
Cheers,
  Trond
