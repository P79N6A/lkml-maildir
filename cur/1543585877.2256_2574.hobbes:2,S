Hey, there's even a spec which says that config symbols have to look
like CONFIG_*:
  # Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt
  A /symbol/ is a single unquoted word.  A symbol must have a name of
  the form CONFIG_*.  scripts/mkdep.c relies on this convention in order
  to generate dependencies on individual CONFIG_* symbols instead of
  making one massive dependency on include/linux/autoconf.h.
