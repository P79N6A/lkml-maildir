This might be a crazy / stupid idea, so flame at will :)
Wouldn't it be possible to do a samba "super-server" mode, in which samba would 
assume that it controlled the directories it is exporting?
In this mode a "corporate" Samba server, serving Windows clients, could improve 
performance by assuming that its cache was always up-to-date.
If if we wanted to access the directory locally we could always mount locally 
using samba, and access the files anyway, albeit a lot slower and without linux 
permissions, etc.
What we would gain was the ability to say "I want to give priority to my samba 
server" (and set it to "super-server" mode) or "my priority is to the linux 
native filesystem, and just want to share my files with windows users anyway" 
(and keep using samba as always).
