Thanks for the patch, see my comments inline.

Yes, these fixes to Kconfig are all correct.

No, these changes are not correct. Due to the fact i2c_detect() is
designed, i2c detection functions should never return -ENODEV. Doing so
would result in i2c_detect() to skip the probing of remaining addresses
for a given chip driver. We might change i2c_detect() to make it behave
differently at some point, but for now your previous code is correct and
should not be changed.
(Also note that the code of your changes itself is not correct at all,
as was pointed out elsewhere in this thread - but it doesn't really
matter now.)

This is a completely different change. Please submit unrelated changes
as different patches, because they will be applied by different persons
so it's way more convenient that way.
If you resubmit a patch with only the drivers/i2c/chips/Kconfig changes,
I'll get it applied. Don't forget a desription of the patch and the
Signed-Off-By line with your name and mail address at the top of the
post.
Thanks,
