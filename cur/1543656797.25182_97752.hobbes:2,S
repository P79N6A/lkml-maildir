The problem is that valgrind is going to look under the covers of the kernel
allocators and see the externally-visible requirements being violated.
Either you implement a globally correct description, which includes the 
externally visible description as a subset, or you somehow tell valgrind not
to complain about stuff inside the allocator.
The second sounds complicated, and anyway hides bugs in the allocator.

And are another reason for implementing a globally correct description.
