Hi ,
my prob is a s follows : Dawicontrol DC-2974 (AM53C974 Chip)
( as in README described changed AM53C974.H to use SCSI-ID 7)
and JVC X-W2010 : the Drive isn´t recognized as SCSI-Device
neither it´s listed in /proc/scsi/scsi nor cdrecord -scanbus lists the
device ....
(AMDriver o.5 alpha from ´96 with kernel source ....)
( I have been struggling with this prob from Kernel 2.0.30 to 2.2.7 )
(currently i use Kernel 2.2.7, AM... driver compiled as module)
( It´s working under DOS and WIN ... correctly so there should be no
problem with connection (Terminating and so on)
Parity Protocol is enabled )
With lilo Params i tried to lower the frequency to 3Mhz ; no changes ...
Does anyone know a solution ; i want to remove windows from my harddisc
(i have to use it for burning...) ....
mfg inku
