Hello
When I enable CONFIG_USB_HID and not enable CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT in 2.4.25, will
I get something different from when I don't enable neither of them?
The <Help> says basically the same about both: that they control
"keyboards, mice, joysticks, graphics tablets, or any other HID based devices"
(CONFIG_USB_HID)
"keyboard, mouse or joystick or any other HID input device"
(CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT)
I assume
1) it doesn't matter if "keyboard" or "keyboards" is in the <Help>
2) graphics tablets are assumed to be "any other HID input devices".
