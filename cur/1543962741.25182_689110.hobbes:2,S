Perhaps this is problem: The menu item shouldn't be selectable for sure
but it may well be visible (and I'm purposely ignoring details of "how
to grey out" for the different user interfaces).
If it's visible (but not selectable) the user interface can provide the
auto-generated requirements (derived from the "depends on" chains) as
part of the "help" or where ever it seems useful. And the user at least
knows where to look further.

Which makes sense from the usability point of view for typical library
functions (e.g. zlib, CRC, ...).
But that ("which CONFIG_ variables actually selected this CONFIG_
variable" and/or "which CONFIG_ variables will selected this CONFIG_
variable") could also be automatically generated and displayed.
