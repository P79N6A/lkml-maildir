Oh, really, you think this works so well? Ever tried to use more than
one soundcard? A USB audio device? Ever wondered why oh why one has to
always check and twiddle with the mixers? Why (it seems) setting the
volume of USB audio devices via alsamixer doesn't work for apps which
use OSS emulation? Ever wondered why alsactl restore doesn't get called
by udev by default?
The current Linux approach (most distributions) is to let the user be
the master. Which means lots of typing, configuring, tweaking. Try that
on a tablet pc without a keyboard.
Things should Just Work. I wish most Linux developers tried using a Mac
at least once in their lifetimes.
