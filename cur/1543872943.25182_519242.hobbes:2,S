Argh, no, this change was done to help the ftdi drivers out.
Look at changeset d9a7ecacac5f8274d2afce09aadcf37bdb42b93a in Linus's
tree from Jim Radford:
	
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=d9a7ecacac5f8274d2afce09aadcf37bdb42b93a
It makes this change because the usb-serial drivers need the port
devices when the port_remove() callbacks happen.  Otherwise you get an
oops that way.
Jim, can you take a look at this and see if you can figure something
out?
thanks,
greg k-h
