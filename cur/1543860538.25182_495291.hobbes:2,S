it strikes me that that latter part is starting to go beyond the scope
of simple coding style aesthetics and getting into actual coding
distinctions.  would that really be appropriate for the CodingStyle
doc?  i'm just asking.

ok, i was just trying to make the calls consistent based on what i
could see in the current source code.  i'm still reviewing the
material on DMA -- feel free to suggest better wording.
rday
p.s.  what DMA doc are you referring to above?  DMA-mapping.txt?
