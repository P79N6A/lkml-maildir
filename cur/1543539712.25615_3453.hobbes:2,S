Hi guys,
Before I go on investigating what's wrong - is this something
trivial? Attempting to startup rpc.lockd in plain Red Hat 6.2 running
2.4.0-test5-pre4 (with NFSv3 enabled both cli/srv) results in
"lockdsvc: invalid something" error.
Shouldn't Documentation/Changes mention if I need a newer version of
nfs-utils? I have 0.1.6 as shipped by Red Hat in 6.2. Or perhaps locking
doesn't work at all? I will soon find out...
Regards,
Tigran
