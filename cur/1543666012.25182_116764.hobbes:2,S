It is _hard_ to do with variable length instructions (CISC, remember?), the
code is designed to be easily decoded forward, noone executes code going
backwards. Finding out what starts at EIP is easy.
When I needed to look at the code in an Oops I'd either objdump(1)ed it or
compiled the offending stuff to assembler (possibly with custom CFLAGS to
get info on line numbers and such in the output).
