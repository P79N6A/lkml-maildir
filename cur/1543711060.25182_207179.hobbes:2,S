I admit I seem to be the only one still complaining, so I suspect I must have
a mobo with a rare chip type.  The bug is definitely *not* fixed for me, as of
today's latests changesets from Linus.
The problem lies in the way the chip is initialized on bootup, clearly, because
doing ifconfig down/up changes a few bytes of memory and starts things working
until the next reboot.
Here is a before/after diff of lspci -xxx.  You can see that byte 0x94 has been
reset by the ifconfig down/up:

I wish I had the expertise to figure out what code is responsible
for resetting that bit, but alas I don't.
If you could give me even a hint of what sections of the tg3 code
to look at I might be able to pick it up from there -- e.g. what
part of the driver code would be exercised by 'ifconfig down' that
isn't done by the 'ifconfig up' at bootup.
