Not directly.  I cannot easily test kernel patches on our larger, production
clusters.  We've seen the issue with specific applications on 512 and 1024
cores, but I've only been able to test the patch on a 48-core cluster.  I have
verified that it successfully increases the timeout to where it *should* work,
but cannot absolutely confirm that it will fix the problem.  I'm unlikely to
know that until the production clusters move to an OFED release (1.3?)
containing this patch.
