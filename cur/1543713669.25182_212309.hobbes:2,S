That's not policy. That's mechanism (one of many).

Let me get this right. You learned LISP right?
Now you think it's the only way to go. There is
a name for this, where one starts to identify
with his captors... It's called the Stockholm
Syndrome, named after four Swedes bound in bank-
vault for six days became attached to their captors.
LISP is just a TOOL and a poor one, at that. There
are many tools available under Unix/Linux and, if
you don't like what's available, you can readily
make your own. Once you learn new tools, the Stockholm
Syndrome will go away although you'll probably always
like the first tool you learned to use. I like DDT,
myself.
Nobody who has a clue would suggest LISP inside a kernel.
When I first read this, I was sure it was an April-fool
joke, although somewhat cruel, kinda like; "what to do
with a dead cat..."
Cheers,
