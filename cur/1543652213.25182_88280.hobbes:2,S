Subject: [PATCH] use 64 bit jiffies 4/4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Part 4/4: use unsigned long for cpu statistics
This is more like a band-aid.
It used to be enough when we had HZ=100 on 32 bit platforms, and only
Alphas had the cpu statistics wrapping after 48.5 days.
Fixing 64 bit platforms is easily done with this patch, fixing 32 bit
would need annoying locking.
Well, it's only statistics after all, and there weren't many complaints
about Alpha, so maybe we just don't fix it at all...
