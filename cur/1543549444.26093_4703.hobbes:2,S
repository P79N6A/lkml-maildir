The scheme don't limit the entropy of the key to 160 bits if the
passpharse has more entropy than that, so the scheme should be suitable.
Keylength of 160 bit is anyway a large margin for this kind of use.
A drawback by changing hash is that people will no longer be able to mount
their encrypted disks with the new version of losetup.  This version is a
pure extensions to be able to use algorithms with more than 160 bit
keysize. It will probably be a bad idea to break compatibility when no
significant security improvment can be archieved.
I'm almost certain that nobody have passphrases with more than 160 bits of
real entropy. I don't think that the overall security for the system will
increse, neither with this patch nor with a change to ripemd-320. Of that
reason I prefere compatibility unless ripemd-160 should be broken some
time in the future.

With sufficient thrust, pigs fly just fine. However, this is not
necessarily a good idea. It is hard to be sure where they are going
to land, and it could be dangerous sitting under them as they fly
overhead. (from RFC 1925)
