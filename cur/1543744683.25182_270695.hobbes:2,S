Interesting. The only difference here should be barriers. I hate the
lack of barriers in that driver ... I'm not sure the driver may not have
other bugs related to the lack of them in the 16 and 32 bits accessors.
It does use non-barrier version on purpose in some accel ops though,
when filling the fifo with pixels, but that's pretty much the only case
where it makes sense.

{in,out}_8 are ppc-specific things that are identical to readb/writeb
indeed, with barriers.
