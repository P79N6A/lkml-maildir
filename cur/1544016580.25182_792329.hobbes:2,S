That's harsh.  set_cpus_allowed is *always* questionable in these cases.  Sometimes it's harmless, and sometimes there was a risk that we could run on the wrong cpu.
The mistake was that work_on_cpu() should rely on the caller to ensure the CPU doesn't go away.  It's a worse interface, but this reduces the number of *new* bugs, at least.
Subject: cpumask: don't try to get_online_cpus() in work_on_cpu.
This has caused more problems than it solved, with a pile of cpu
hotplug locking issues.
Followup patches will get_online_cpus() in callers that need it, but
if they don't do it they're no worse than before when they were using
set_cpus_allowed without locking.
