This looks nice.

Is this really necessary?  It looks like we are adding a "special" type
of parser here that no one uses.

Nice.

Nice.

Hm, but why?  Can't we do this today with the attribute groups?

I'm still not sold on why this is needed.  It looks like a lot of extra
work for something that we are already handling.
