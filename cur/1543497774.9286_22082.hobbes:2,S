Ehm. sys_sendfile is for  fd->fd, mine is for file -> socket. I don't know
if I'm able to merge some of this... (And I don't think Linus would like
this)

My version also grabs the kernel-lock, because I didn't know if it was
allowed NOT to use it for this special case.

I don't think Linus will accept a http-server in the main kernel. But who
knows... It is a nice tool to pinpoint bottlenecks in the kernel.
