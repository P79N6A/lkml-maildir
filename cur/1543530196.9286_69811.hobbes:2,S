Hello,
netfilter kernel level routines and the netfilter package seem to differ
and the package cannot be compiled. Some structures like nfdev_interest,
and nf_wakeme, referenced in the netfilter package (0.1.18 and 0.90.4),
are deleted in newer kernel versions.
I mailed Rusty, but he seems absent. Does anyone have a patch for
correcting the user-level functions ?
Mit freundlichen Grüßen / kind regards
Frank
