Couldn't there be 3 areas in the mmap buffer:
- Unused: entries that the kernel can alloc from.
- Alloced: entries alloced by kernel but not yet used by user. Kernel can 
update these if new events requires that.
- Consumed: entries that the user are processing.
The user takes a set of alloced entries and make them consumed. Then it 
processes the events after which it makes them unused. 
If there are no unused entries and the kernel needs some, it has wait for free 
entries. The user has to notify when unused entries becomes available. It 
could set a flag in the mmap'ed area to avoid unnessesary wakeups.
The are some details with indexing and wakeup notification that I have left 
out, but I hope my idea is clear. I could give a more detailed description if 
requested. Also, I'm a user-level programmer so I might not get the whole 
picture.
