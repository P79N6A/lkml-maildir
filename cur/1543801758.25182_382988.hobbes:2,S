Well you can use a lint program to catch these things. Pretty much
all lints do whole program analysis for types. Perhaps it would
be a good idea to adopt one for the kernel. The best one is unfortunately
not free.
Or just never put an extern into any .c file and set some linker
options that make sure that double definitions without extern
error out (not sure that's possible, but it might be)
