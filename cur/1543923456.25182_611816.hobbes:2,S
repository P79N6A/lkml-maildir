Same.  Top-level makefile kludges around that:
SRCARCH         := $(ARCH)
# for i386 and x86_64 we use SRCARCH equal to x86
SRCARCH := $(if $(filter x86_64 i386,$(SRCARCH)),x86,$(SRCARCH))
and then plays with both ARCH and SRCARCH.  Note
# If a arch/$(SRCARCH)/Kconfig.$(ARCH) file exist use it
ifneq ($(wildcard $(srctree)/arch/$(SRCARCH)/Kconfig.$(ARCH)),)
        Kconfig := arch/$(SRCARCH)/Kconfig.$(ARCH)
else
        Kconfig := arch/$(SRCARCH)/Kconfig
endif
in scripts/kconfig/Makefile, BTW - now we use arch/x86/Kconfig.i386 and
arch/x86/Kconfig.x86_64 as starting points for ARCH=i386 and ARCH=x86_64
resp.
