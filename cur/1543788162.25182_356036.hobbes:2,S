I've talked to a lawyer or two, and (a) there's an absolutely _huge_ 
difference and (b) they liked it.
The fact is, the law isn't a blind and mindless computer that takes what 
you say literally. Intent matters a LOT. And using the xxx_GPL() version 
to show that it's an internal interface is very meaningful indeed.
One of the lawyers said that it was a much better approach than trying to 
make the license explain all the details - codifying the intention in the 
code itself is not only more flexible, but a lot less likely to be 
misunderstood.
I think both them said that anybody who were to change a xyz_GPL to the 
non-GPL one in order to use it with a non-GPL module would almost 
immediately fall under the "willful infringement" thing, and that it would 
make it MUCH easier to get triple damages and/or injunctions, since they 
clearly knew about it.
I suspect programmers make horrible lawyers. They nitpick on details that 
sane humans don't. I think programmers often end up forgetting about the 
fact that human interactions don't work that way. Common sense makes a lot 
of difference, and DWIM is not just possible, but it's the only thing that 
matters.
