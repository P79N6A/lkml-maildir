I've been using Gmail and thought you might like to try it out. Here's
an invitation to create an account.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Manik Raina has invited you to open a free Gmail account. The invitation
will expire in three weeks and can only be used to set up one account.
To accept this invitation and register for your account, visit
http://gmail.google.com/gmail/a-8698430991-493bac7d4c-83862da383
Once you create your account, Manik Raina will be notified with
your new @gmail.com address so you can stay in touch with Gmail!
If you haven't already heard about Gmail, it's a new search-based webmail
service that offers:
- 1,000 megabytes (one gigabyte) of free storage
- Built-in Google search that instantly finds any message you want
- Automatic arrangement of messages and related replies into
 "conversations"
- Text ads and related pages that are relevant to the content of your
 messages
Gmail is still in an early stage of development. If you set up an
account, you'll be able to keep it even after we make Gmail more
widely available and as one of the system's early testers, you will
be helping us improve the service through your feedback. We might ask
for your comments and suggestions periodically and we appreciate your
help in making Gmail even better.
Thanks,
The Gmail Team
