I am seeking input on a new line discipline I have written for use 
with synchronous serial adapters (HDLC). I wrote this in conjunction
with a device driver for my company's  multiprotocol serial adapter.
The goal was to use the standard tty programming and driver
interface for synchronous communications. The new line discipline
enforces a frame oriented view of data for the read and write 
system calls. One write call == one HDLC frame, data returned
by one read call == one HDLC frame. 
Other aspects of using the serial device remain the same
as for asynchronous use.
This has worked very well and I am preparing to submit the new
source (for 2.3.x) after the 2.2 dust settles.
Because the HDLC line discipline is intended to be generic to 
any synchronous serial device driver and it is my hope that this
would be adopted as a common method for supporting synchronous
communications, I am seeking input from anyone with a common
interest before submission.
Thanks for any input,
Paul
