Hmm... I couldn't understand "why icache includes old lines in a new page."
This happens at
 - a file is newly loaded into page-cache.
 - only on NFS.
 - happens very *often* if the program is unlucky.
So I wrote my understainding as I think.

Hmm? I added VM_EXEC check in flush_(d|i)cache_page(). Isn't it enough ?

no benchmarks yet.

I know your *simple* patch in April wasn't included. So I wrote this.
In April thread, commenter's advices was "implement flush_icache_page()" I think.  
If you have a better patch, please post.
