I've got a remote machine running ubuntu 2.6.24-19-generic which I ssh
into.  When I said "poweroff -f -p" it strangely came back after a few
seconds.  Perhaps my banging on the keyboard made a difference.  The
same thing happened when I said "halt -f -p".  Sounds like user error to
me, except the log file shows kernel halt messages.  These are the last
n lines logged:

I can't explain that.
