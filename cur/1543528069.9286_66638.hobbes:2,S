No. Do yourself a favour, run it through search engines. It _is_ an
amusing story.
And as for the hacks like // - sorry, but it was done in _much_ more
elegant way 15 years ago. And the reason why I'm not pushing the
corresponding patches is very simple - we need more robust race
prevention in namei.c/dcache.c before _any_ work in that area. Otherwise
we'll just get a steaming pile of broken code. And frankly, that's about
the last place where you want races - anything here translates into root
exploits _way_ too easy.
