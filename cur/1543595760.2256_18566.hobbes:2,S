Have you considered the method used by the 8390 Ethernet driver?
For each device, add a pointer to the registers and a register shift.
I really don't like hacing virtual access functions that makes memory
mapped I/O look the same as I/O operations. For memory mapped I/O you
want to be able to smart optimizations to reduce the access on the PCI
bus (or similar).
