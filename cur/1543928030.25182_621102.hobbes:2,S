The lines Peer indicates below will work for any vendor's bridge device
that implements an HT MSI mapping and is an upstream bridge of the
endpoint requesting MSI.
On some NVIDIA chipsets, the host bridge that implements HT MSI mapping
is not hierarchically upstream from the MSI endpoint; it may be a peer
on the same bus as the endpoint or the PCIe root complex that's above
the endpoint. The NVIDIA-specific code in the patch is to detect those
specific chipsets where this can occur. We have tested the patch with
both internal and PCI Express MSI endpoints on each of these NVIDIA
chipsets.
It may be that other vendors have Hypertransport chipsets with similar
requirements for HT MSI mapping, but we don't have that information or
the ability to test code on those vendors' chipsets.
Regards,
Andy

I think the following lines are suitable for other bridges besides
nvidia's, :) :
===================
+		if (pci_enable_msi_ht_cap(dev) != 0) {
+			return 0;
+		} else {
+			/* Get upstream bridge device handle */
+
+			bridge_dev = dev->bus->self;
+			while(bridge_dev != 0) {
+				if (pci_enable_msi_ht_cap(bridge_dev) !=
0) {
+					return 0;
+				} else
+					bridge_dev =
bridge_dev->bus->self;
+			}
+
+			return 1;
+		}

Isn't there a way we can make this work for any upstream HT bridge,
rather than only for specific NVIDIA chipsets?
