John,
I'm not sure what change caused this, but it seems that keyboard and
mouse interrupts are firing more than once when I'm using the c3tsc
timesource.  It manifests itself as multiple keypresses and odd mouse
tapping.  The problem seems to appear only in X, and it's definitely
confined to c3tsc (jiffies, pit, tsc-interp, and acpi_pm all seem to
work fine [1]).
[1] Note: Don't try to force-load the hpet timesource if you don't have
one, or if you aren't certain of the address :)
Frank
