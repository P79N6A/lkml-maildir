Actually, the answer Kevin wanted was:
cd /usr/src/linux
grep -r __user_walk .
which will tell you it's in fs/namei.c - near line 967 for 2.6.9-test7 tree.
Unfortunately, it's basically a wrapper for path_lookup (also in fs/namei.c maybe
110 lines up from there).. which will drop you into link_path_walk() a ways above
that.  link_path_walk() is where the actual fun happens - note that most of
link_path_walk()'s actual work is done by calls to do_lookup() and follow_mount().
I would suggest Kevin read and understand *ALL* of fs/namei.c....
