	Unfortunately, it won't work for IrDA. The reason is that you
tend to have path like this :
		IrLAP -> IrLMP -> IrTTP -> IrNET/IrCOMM/IrLAN/IrSock -> IrTTP -> IrLMP -> IrLAP
	And I can't have one global spinlock for the IrDA stack,
because the higher layers (IrNET/IrCOMM/IrLAN/IrSOCK) are totally
independant and have their own locking (for example, I can guarantee
you the IrNET is already safe).
	I'm also especially nervous about keeping a spinlock and irq
off while calling protocols higher layres, such as the various socket
function (IrSOCK), or the PPP mux (IrNET), or the TTY layer (IrCOMM).
	My feeling is that doing the _one_ spinlock properly would be
as much work than fixing the root problem (the hasbins).

	Been there, done that. I've been the one doing most the
original SMP work in most Wireless LAN drivers (and the HP100 driver),
and I'm still the one doing most testing.
	So, I feel qualified to comment about the IrDA situation.

	No, here the problem is that the whole locking design is
broken. I know perfectly that the hashbin locking is totally unsafe
and it's a miracle that it work at all. And I'm not sure if I will
ever get something 100% safe.

	Unfortunately, with the current IrDA code, I don't have much
choice but to do it somewhat right.
	Now, it's a matter of priorities. The other IrDA developpers
have been bitten by "nothing is wrong" IDE in 2.5.X, so the logical
course of action is to shift to 2.4.X until I find time to get back to
this issue and catch up.
	But having IrDA not functional in 2.5.X for a few months is
certainly not that painful compared to other problems in 2.5.X.
	And as I was saying to Ingo, the good news is that I'll
probably also no longer will need "deliver_to_old_one()" in the
networking code.
	Have fun...
	Jean
