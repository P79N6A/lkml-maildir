Actually, putting the unit in terms of cycles is more portable and 
flexible.  Rather than perform a conversion from cycles to 
nano/femto/pico seconds, the raw cycle count is exposed, along with the 
current clock frequency.  This allows the timer infrastructure to merely 
do one conversion, from cycles to real time, rather than converting to 
an arbitrary time unit which may change with operating systems and time 
and thus break the ABI.
