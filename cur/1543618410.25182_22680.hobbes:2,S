I don't think thats the full problem, I just noticed I had been getting
errors too with the via driver, but it's been working fine otherwise:
(heres all of them, don't know what was going on at all the times, but I
was browsing the web for a bit at 9:50)

the status makes sense from what I can tell, I could never figure out
what 782d was.
ifconfig reports:
TX packets:657170 errors:52 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:52
Is it possible that the problem is with the hub and via-rhine resetting
the card repetedly just makes it worse?
