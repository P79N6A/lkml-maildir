The new slab is allocated for the node that was determined earlier and 
entered into the slab queues for that node. Howver, during the alloc we 
were rescheduled.
Then we find ourselves on another processor and recalculate the ac 
pointer. If we now retry then there is the danger of getting off node 
objects into the per cpu queue. Which may cause the wrong lock to be taken 
when draining queues. Sucks because it can cause data corruption. Same as
the other issues resolved by GFP_THISNODE.

Will queue it.
