   You're misunderstanding me, I meant that the  first test is done
   AFTER the first iteration is   executed, so my fix is correct
   since, even if order is 0 because at least one iteration of the
   loop  is done, and the post decrement makes sure that the test
   succeeds if order was 0 going into the loop.
Order is always >= 0 when we enter the loop.
If we actually get the table allocated then the decrement of 'order'
is not executed if we allocate the table successfully.
I don't understand what the problem is with my fix.
