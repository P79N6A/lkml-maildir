 From your license page, I can see that the license is based on the MPL 
(Mozilla public license). If you check:
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html
the MPL is listed as a GPL incompatible license.
This means that either the APL solves the issues of the MPL so that it 
is GPL compatible, or you have to ask the original authors permission to 
use their code (which is usually complicated because there are usually a 
lot of them...)
