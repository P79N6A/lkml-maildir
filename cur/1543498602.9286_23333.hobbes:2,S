Exactly.  That has become the purpose of those words -- in fact, that's
the only times that I've really heard/seen them were in times of
frustration.

Hm.  Which would you rather have in YOUR kernel?
	"Fatal Exception 0E at address 349f930d:020a34ff"
Or
	"Something fucked up.  This shouldn't happen."
	"oops 00"
Personally, I'd rather see something say "Something fucked up" and maybe a
description of it, in HUMAN READABLE terms (e.g., readable by
non-programmers and CS majors) as opposed to "fatal exception 0E..." which
really tells a user NOTHING about what just happened.

Well, they may be unprofessional, however, they are very concise, and well
understood among all of us humans, no?
