You just need to be patient and wait for Patrick to get to your
patches, it's as simple as that :-)
Patrick is normally very responsive, so whatever it is it has to be a
temporary issue.
Because of LCA08 etc. I myself wasn't even able to get any networking
bug fix submissions into 2.6.24.1
Big deal, we'll just get it into the next 2.6.24.x release.
Thanks for your patience.
