Bus locking while waiting for command completion. If you start a
long-lasting operation on one device, the other device on the same cable
is blocked so you cannot feed the other.
Same holds for SCSI if one of the devices involved doesn't disconnect
from the bus for that long-lasting command.
Try for instance "eject /dev/hdc" while writing to /dev/hdd, or same
stuff with sr0 and sr1. Been there, done that, got a coaster.
