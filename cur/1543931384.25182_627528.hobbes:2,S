Except that it's very likely that it will be assigned, whether it's used
or not, either by the BIOS or the kernel during
pci_assign_unassign_resources().
If we really have some devices where we -know- we can hide the thing
totally, we can then do a quirk for these.
We may be taking a small risk here, but what else do you propose ? The
problem of dangling BARs is real... One option is for me to address it
on powerpc and leave x86 alone as it might be more of an issue with
random crazy embedded firmware for us than it is for x86. As I said, the
workaround is completely self contained within arch code for now.

Ok.
