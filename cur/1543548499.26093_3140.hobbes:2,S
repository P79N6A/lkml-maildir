I know, the description was not very clear.
But the attached program is very easy to compile and start.
I tried to extract only what's necessary from the involved code.
There are no hidden trojans inside, i promise.
My kernel is 2.2.17 with ext3 patches from Steven and the tnt drivers from NVIDIA.
I hope this patches do not affect the tests but if you have any suggestions
i will remove what's necessary to make the tests more believable.
On 2.4.0-testX i will do the tests at home in the evening.
