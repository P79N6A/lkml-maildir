aha. now it's clear. thank you. I catched J_ASSERT(b_committed_data != NULL)
in ext3_free_blocks() with de-BKL'ed JBD. hence, my solution is to have a
tid journal_head indicating which transaction uses b_committed_data.
I don't want to look intrusive, but .. what do you think about new locking
schema I'm trying to implement?
