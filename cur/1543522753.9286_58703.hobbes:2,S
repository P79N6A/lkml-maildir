The nbdd kernel server supports using the exported block device as a
swap device
by the nbd client.  For instructions on howto setup swapping over
a nbd client I'll refer to the nbd client homepage,
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/nbd/nbd.html
Remember that the nbd client is started (and in some respects run) by a
user space process.
