It serializes to the bridge. On the Altix for example this is done by reading
a local status register with the pending write count in it and waiting until
the chip reports the write has propogated across the fabric. At that point it
has hit the bridge and the usual PCI posting applies, but the PCI ordering
rule will also apply so the write won't be passed by another write issued
after the spinlock is then dropped.

Yes. mmiowb only serializes to the bridge. Thats how it is defined in the
documentation. Thats enough to sort out things like the example with locks,
but where a read from the device would be overkill.

mmiowb comes about from the Altix folks strangley enough.

Various core drivers like tg3 use mmiowb()
