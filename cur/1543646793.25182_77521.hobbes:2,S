I don't think that basing kernel internal interfaces on ioctl is
a smart idea.  Just add another function pionter to your operations
vector for every operation you want supported on volumes.
That way the uppermost layer can do the translation from the ugly
ioctl interface (or a future nice fs-based interface) to the operations
once instead of carrying the user-defined syscalls (aka ioctls)
around through your whole architecture.

Again, why can't you have open/close _methods_ for it instead of abusing
the ioctl interface.  It would be even nicer if you could extend
the block device operations with your new volume-mangment methods
instead of adding another API for blockdevices/disks outside the higher
level kernel code.

Umm.  I'd suggest you fix the read/write access instead of duplicating those
two core unix syscalls in an messy ioctl API.

Based on that argumentation we should make memcpy a syscall..
