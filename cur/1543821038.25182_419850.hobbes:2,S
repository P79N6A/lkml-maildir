Grouping SELinux with previous trusted systems doesn't make sense to me.
Administering non-MLS SELinux systems is already easier than
administering traditional MAC systems like Trusted Solaris and Trusted
IRIX. Much of the pain from tradition MAC systems comes from the
mismatch between MLS and the real world of unix and unix administration.
I know that you will disagree with this because you believe that MLS and
BIBA are simplier than TE, but that doesn't match my experience or the
feedback we get from our customers.
