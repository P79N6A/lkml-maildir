Yes, it was.  I couldn't get a handle on the semantics of multiple
definitions given that people can visit the tree in any order.  So I
left it out of the document.
The worst offenders are things like CONFIG_RTNETLINK where parts of
some scripts want them to be user defined and parts of other scripts
want to define them automatically.

Yes -- it usually does what people want, but only as a result of kludges
with not enough formal semantics.
mconfig doesn't complain yet.  The hard part is that it's useful
and good to test options that are *never* defined (typically because
drivers/foo/Config.in wants to look at some arch-specific options).

I've thought about this.  I think a dependency (a conditional test)
is valid only if the values being tested have been defined or asked
for earlier in the same menu or earlier in a parent menu.  Definitions
in a *sibling* menu, even an earlier sibling menu, aren't adequate
because an mconfig/xconfig user is entitled to traverse the menu
tree in any order.

That is a different issue.
The problem is the way that the config programs read in the existing
configuration.  The easy, obvious way is to "source .config" and set
all the variables.  But this is wrong because it sets variables that
should not be set yet.
The correct way is to start with all variables set to "" (just like
a blank configuration).  When executing a config line, if there is
an existing value, then pick up that existing value.
Linus phrased it this way a couple of years ago: "there are no default
values.  There are only default answers to questions".

Me too.
