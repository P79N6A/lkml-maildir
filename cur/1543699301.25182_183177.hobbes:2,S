I belive that is what is done for the usermode includes (excluding the
inlines), and including some of the constants.
As a matter of fact, the user includes can't be used in the kernel anyway
since they ARE incomplete from the kernels point of view. They don't even
have to match the kernel at all.. They DO have to match the libc being
used, though.

You are still deriving your binary from a GPL source when a module is loaded.
The kernel relocation symbols themselves are under GPL.
The advantage that the NVIDIA approach has is that all GPL symbols/relocation/
whatever is handled by the wrapper for the binary driver. And that wrapper is
distributed in an "acceptable" way.
The DISadvantage it has is that the "defined" module interface changes. And it
can even change during minor updates. The module interface is NOT a fixed 
target, like the usermode interface is. And then the NVIDIA driver(and/or
wrapper) will require changes to continue to work...
And bugs in a tainted kernel will continue to be unfixable.
