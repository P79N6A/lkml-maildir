no. /proc as an interface has the same disadvantages as the /etc
approach.
(there was talk about something like /proc/vdso.so - but in this special
case the kernel is much better at mapping the vdso pages: why spend
three syscalls and a pagefault on something that can be done zero-cost.)
99.9% of userspace code is modularized around the concept of ELF DSOs.
They are well-understood and have a history of providing good control of
backwards and forwards compatibility. They are flexible and they dont
really have any baggage that affects performance. A DSO is the ideal
interface to attach the kernel to glibc. Code and constant data can
reside in this DSO just fine. (even non-constant data can reside in the
DSO.) I'd really not want to reinvent the wheel and put yet another
concept of a dynamic shared object into the kernel (and make that
per-platform too).
