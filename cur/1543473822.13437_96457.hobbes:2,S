Hello,
I thought I saw someone mention a few weeks ago some issues with
gettimeofday(). I noticed today while I was profiling some matrix math
optimizations that timeval.tv_usec seemed to be wrapping quickly. A typical
output:
start time: 915229599s
finish time: 915229609s
time diff: 10s
start time: 746072us
finish time: 605152us
time diff: -140920us
The first uses tv_sec, and the second one tv_usec. There /is/ about ten
seconds pause between the successive calls. By my calculations, tv_usec should
wrap every 31 minutes or so on an x86. Am I missing something?
