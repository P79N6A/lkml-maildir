Hello,
for a user space nfs-daemon it would be helpful to get the inode generation 
numbers. However it seems the fstat() from the glibc doesn't support this, 
but refering to some google search fstat() from some (not all) other unixes 
does.
Does anyone know how to read those numbers from userspace with linux?
Thanks,
	Bernd
