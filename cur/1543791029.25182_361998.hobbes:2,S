Except verify_area() would pre-fault the pages in whereas access_ok()
just verifies that the address is a user page.  That's quite important
in this case because in order to fault the page in, we need to use
put_user() to get the permission checking correct.
However, we can't use put_user() because then the cmpxchg emulation
becomes completely non-atomic.
