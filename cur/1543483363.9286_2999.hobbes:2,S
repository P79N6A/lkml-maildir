This means that you should be added to killfile of linux-kernel list (if there
are any). Men who decided not to contribute do not deserve support from
community. It's one story if you are not smart enough to help in linux
development. It's COMPLETELY other story if you stated (in public) that you
do not have plans to give something but at the same time you expect help
from others. You simple not deserve sych help. That's all.
