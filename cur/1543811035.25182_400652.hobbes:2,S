If the formatting of the oopses is  your only problem you are a 
lucky man.
The problem is your new format uses more screen estate, which is precious
after an oops because the VGA scrollback is so small.
That is why i rejected the earlier attempts at changing this.
I can offer you a deal though: if you fix VGA scrollback to have
at least 1000 lines by default we can change the oops formatting too.
