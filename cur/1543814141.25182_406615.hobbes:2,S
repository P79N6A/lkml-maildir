Sure, I'll try.  But I've been pounding on this kernel for weeks and
only hit this once.  And I'm pretty sure I've killed processes with lots
of swapped memory.  The only new variable was acroread - open 5 PDFs in
Firefox tabs, leave it alone for a few days until the kernel swaps it
all out, then kill it...
