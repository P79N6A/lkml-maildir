Well, the discussion seem to have quiet down (so time to start it up 
again ;) ). But would you take a patch for a generic implementation of 
bool/false/true? I sent one 29th of July with no complaints or 
suggestions. I am happy to send it again.
About this patch, isn't better to leave the 'bool'-type if there is a 
will to make a common boolean? Easier to find and convert a local 
definition of bool then finding functions who are boolean, but decleard 
as some kind of integer.
Just a thought
