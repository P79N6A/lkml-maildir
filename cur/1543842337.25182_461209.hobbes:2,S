Hi all,
this looks like a serious problem to be fixed before 2.6.18 final and 
backported to 2.6.17.*. Or a case of me misunderstanding something, in 
which case, please, let me know.
I've reported before in thread "[2.6.17.4] slabinfo.buffer_head increases" 
a memory leak in ext3. Today I verified it is still present in 2.6.18-rc6.
A short description: as long as write accesses are made on an ext3 
filesystem /proc/slabinfo buffer_head increases unboundedly. This 
behaviour is not observed with another journalling filesystems (e.g., 
reiserfs), or if ext3 is mounted as ext2.
As it seems serious enough to me I'm sending it to ext3 maintainers.
Thanks
Guennadi
