The Internet Press Guild (
http://www.netpress.org
) is open to reporters and 
editors of any country, not just to US/Canada reporters.  When you write a 
letter to the editor in response to articles such as the one you quote in 
La Repubblica, be sure to mention this fact.
The Internet Press Guild was formed by Internet-savvy working reporters in 
response to the Time magazine CyberPorn article.  (They were chased off the 
newsgroup alt.internet.media-coverage when the SNR dropped like a 
rock.)  It's mission:  to provide a place where working press can check 
stories they are about to run regarding the Internet to avoid egg-on-face 
syndrome.
The IPG contains a few people close to Linux development, so while a story 
like this is a little beyond the original charter, a quick check would have 
avoided the gaff.
