One of the reasons that Linux is so hackable is that
crummy names get changed. Here too, the old names are bad.
An old example: we use copy_from_user now, not copy_fromfs.
Don't you agree that this is an improvement? It broke code
unnecessarily, but Linus did it anyway. Linux would be a
lot less readable if it had screwy names everywhere.
Perhaps you shouldn't touch kernel code if you can't
remember that copy_fromfs is unrelated to fs code.
Still, why make things difficult? The less effort you
waste remembering stupid names, the more you can spare
for writing great code.
