Well I guess you can set it to:
eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:10:5A:27:7B:16
           inet addr:1.3.4.5  Bcast:1.255.255.255  Mask:255.255.255.252
                                                                    ^^^
           inet6 addr: fe80::210:5aff:fe27:7b16/64 Scope:Link
           UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
           RX packets:68120 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
           TX packets:5 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:3
           collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
           RX bytes:4383953 (4.1 Mb)  TX bytes:378 (378.0 b)
           Interrupt:22 Base address:0xbc00
That should ne able to isolate the two machines on the same wire.
Cheers,
