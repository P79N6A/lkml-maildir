Jul 21 00:15:54 ishtar nfsd[1590]: Unauthorized access by NFS client 
192.168.3.2.
Jul 21 00:15:58 ishtar last message repeated 5928 times
I wanted to give ro access to all clients on a 192.168.3.0/26 network to 
a "/Share"
directory, and rw to a few, but I've never managed to get the network access
statement to work correctly.  Finally I switched to a /24 network to 
make netmasks more cleanI simply removed every thing but the
'ro' export of /Share which I thought should work but does not.  The above
client is an example.
server:
    inet addr:192.168.3.1  Bcast:192.168.3.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
/etc/exports:
/Share          192.168.3.0/24(async,ro,no_subtree_check,nohide)
 > showmount -e
Export list for server:
/Share   192.168.3.0/24
client:
    configed as inet addr:192.168.3.2  Bcast:192.168.3.255  
Mask:255.255.255.0
Client had access when it was specifically given access by hostname, but 
doesn't
solve access problems for anonymous dhcp hosts that I bring online as 
test machines.
Are there some options needed for anon client access?
the kernel seems to indicate it is exporting to the subnet, yet it is 
denying
mount permisson...bug, misconfig?
