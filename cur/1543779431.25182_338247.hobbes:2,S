Because so far ITCs were not truly synchronized.

I have no objections to making nojitter the default. There is already some 
PAL information that provides information on ITC reliability. If you can 
insure that this is accurate (currently it indicates no drift even if 
the ITC's have an offset) then simply switch on nojitter for small 
boxes.
