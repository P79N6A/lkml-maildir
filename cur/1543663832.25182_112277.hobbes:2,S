Please remind me. Why can't NFS set inode->i_mode, call
nfs_fill_inode() etc. in the 'init_locked' callback?
As for the issue of the stat() problem you mentioned: does your server
have a monotonically increasing inode->i_ctime? If ntp or something
like that keeps turning the clock backward on the server, then the NFS
client has no chance of recognizing which attribute updates are the
more recent ones.
Cheers,
