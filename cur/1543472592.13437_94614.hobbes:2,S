It has been exceedingly difficult for me to make a binary RPM that included
a device driver module. I have no problem with distributing the source, but
I can't seem to find a reliable way to distribute a device driver to a
customer that would like a binary distribution.
Hell, I can't even make a Makefile that works in common cases. Sheesh!
