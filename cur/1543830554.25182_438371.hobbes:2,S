unix domain socket lookup uses a path_lookup for sockets in the filesystem
namespace and a find_by_name for socket in the abstract namespace.

what is that cookie ? the file dentry and mnt ref ?
so, ok, the resulting struct sock is part of the network namespace but
there is a bridge with the filesystem namespace which does not prevent
other namespaces to do a lookup. the lookup routine needs to be changed,
this is any way necessary for the abstract namespace.
I think we're reaching the limits of namespaces. It would be much easier
with a container id in each kernel object we want to isolate.
