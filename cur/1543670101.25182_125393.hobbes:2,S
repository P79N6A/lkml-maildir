Well, the cli() and sti() part is definitely wrong for 2.5.
It is wrong though to assume that nothing will use these; someone may
copy them directly (and then they do not work) or someone may #include
this file.
I like Arnd's suggestion to just remove these functions and all other
instances of them -- assuming in fact they are never used.
