How about using "SMT width" for the P4 case?
And if we needed to break it down per package for a Power4 and the
like we could talk about CMP something, or other.
Only SMT and CMP seem to be unambiguous prefixes.  Though for CMP
we probably do not need to do anything because it really is 2 cpus, and we
only need to worry about locatity in the cache hierarchy not the fact that
if we schedule a cpu intensive job on 1 ``cpu'' the others are useless.
