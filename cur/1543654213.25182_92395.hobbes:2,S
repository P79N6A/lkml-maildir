How does GDB now distinguish between UML processes?  Previously, with
GDB and UML one would "det; att <host pid>" to trace another process.
Will there be equivalent functionality in the new setup?
I was just thinking about hacking the UML PID allocation code so that
the UML process PID == host process PID, so that it is easier to debug
multiple kernel threads (which are all called "kernel thread" and are
hard to align with a specific UML kernel thread).
Will SMP UML "just" be a matter of forking the host process and sharing
the /proc/mm file descriptors, along with a UML SMP scheduler and some
IPC to decide which host process is running each UML process?
Cheers, Andreas
