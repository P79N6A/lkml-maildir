Anton,
I am noticeable impressed with your ability to address these issues.
Microsoft would be much happier I am certain with a pure Linux solution
for this problem.  They have been incredibly tolerant in allowing 
me to help customers with trashed drives, but I am sure you are 
aware that they were only tolerating it since it was helping 
customers who use both NT and Linux, and even this was quite 
a stretch they did not have to go.   It's a statement that even in 
those cases where tey may be helping Linux, they put their customers
needs first (this took some convincing on my part). 
They are very angry at me right now for even doing this in the 
first place, and I doubt the relationship will ever be back on 
the keel it was originally, but since I work on Linux almost 
exslusively now, I do not think it matters.  
Good Work, A++.
