Hi!
I no longer had time to play with collie (got linux-based phone to
play with - siemens sx1), so my collie went to Milan. Unfortunately
that means that I won't even be boot-testing collie kernels.
Still, 2.6 port is in pretty good shape: touchscreen works, pcmcia
works, battery charging works, even gpe boots... so someone should be
able to do the testing, right?
