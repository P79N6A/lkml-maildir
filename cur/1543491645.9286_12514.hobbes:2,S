Richard,
AFAIK, Linux is the *first* OS that started out as a kernel only. All
of the userland was added. Therefore, as you remark, people will think
of Linux as a Linux OS because historically that has been the case.
You, as well as the FSF, have had more than your share of recognition.
Recognition is also given in the Linux sources. Your continual asking
for renaming Linux distributions to GNU/Linux is becoming tiresome and
childish. The only OS you have any right whatsoever to name is your own,
the HURD. I find asking companies who are pouring their own funds into
Linux development, such as Red Hat, SUSE and Caldera to change the name of 
their *distribution* offensive.
Please stop this nonsence. You are beginning to make a fool of yourself.
Bob
