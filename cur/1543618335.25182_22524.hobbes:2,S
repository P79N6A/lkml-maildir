The range of addresses where speculation is attempted is partially
limited by the page size, for it's unlikely the CPU will attempt to
resolve TLB misses during speculative memory access until it's
committed to them. Furthermore the separate TLB's for 4KB and 4MB
pages on i386 allow far more TLB hits during speculation.

Controlling how page tables are edited and/or statically set up does
not seem that far out to me, though it could be inconvenient,
especially with respect to dynamically-created translations such as
are done for user pages, as there is essentially no infrastructure
for controlling the cacheable attribute(s) of user mappings now as
I understand it.

I would be concerned about efficiency if a larger portion of the direct-
mapped kernel virtual address space than necessary were uncacheable.
Otherwise, if I understand this properly (pardon me for being conservative
in my interpretation) you refer only to the kernel mappings of memory used
by the GART.
