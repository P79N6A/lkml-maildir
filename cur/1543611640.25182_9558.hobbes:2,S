Are you sure? perhaps a forced fsck of all
filesystems would do the trick. New linux users
coming from a microsoft background are too
quick to reinstall as a means of maintenance.

Yes, it looks like the filesystem is corrupted.

Have you tried 2.4.16 since the fsck?

That is the case,

Of course.
The 2.4.15 filesystem corruption problem occurred
on shutdown. When you booted up into 2.4.16, the
filesystem was corrupt and you began to see the
strange symptoms. when you backtracked to 2.4.14
and did the fsck, the problems were corrected.
I'll bet $20 that 2.4.16 runs fine now as well.
