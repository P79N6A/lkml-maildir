This sounds like  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6480
Maybe we can help to resolve this. I already stored a lot of info in
the bugzilla entry.
Could you please describe your setup further? I'm interested on
the devices behind your nvidia NIC, since we only have it at one customers
mail server behind a SonicWall, so we cannot really try a lot. 
For all other customers it works. I'm a bit lost on the cause.
I've seen 4% collisions, which might reduce performance,
but should not stop the transmitter forever.
PS: CC'ed some more relevant addresses to increase awareness.
