Dear Alexander,
I am well aware that almost all distributions use glibc (and have for
quite some time) and did not intend to "make a fool of myself" as you say.
If I said a lie, point out where is the lie, but if I told the truth
(perhaps selectively, as usual, for my convenience (as, yes, I am a happy
customer of Red Hat and delight in their brave decision to switch to
glibc ages ago)), wherefore you called me a fool?
Regards,
Tigran
