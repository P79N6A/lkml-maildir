I used to win the "Dumb context 2003" by buying a laptop w/out checking
the hw compatibility list. It was first sight love :) Now after a series
of custom patches (SiS chipset, pcmcia irq selection, local apic,...)
everything is working fine but the Broadcom integrated WLAN. I suggest you
to go with a machine w/out the integrated WLAN and then buy a supported
pcmcia card (orinoco prismII works great on my machine). To understand who
between Intel and Broadcom will first release specs, take a look at their
web sites for documentation/specs. The answer will become pretty easy.
