Do you think it's worth looking at the initial load-balance code for 
standard SMP?

We have those already (IBM x440) ;-) That's one of the reasons why I prefer
the pools concept I posted at the weekend over just "nodes". Also, there
are NUMA machines where nodes are not all equidistant ... that can be
thought of as multi-level too.

Right, the current model should work fine, it just needs generalising out
a bit.
