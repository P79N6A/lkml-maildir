All true (except for that last reference to urandom), but also irrelevant to
whether UML's hwrng should be hooked up to the host's /dev/random or not.
As far as I can see, the only thing that matters is that hwrng should produce
real randomness, and that can only be had by reading /dev/random (or maybe
the host's /dev/hwrng, but that's supposed to be fed into /dev/random anyway).
So, hooking up the UML /dev/hwrng to the host's /dev/urandom would be lying.
If the host's entropy pool gets drained as a result, I would say that's an
application bug, and not a reason for UML to get its randomness from the
host's /dev/urandom.
