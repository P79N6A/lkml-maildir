Hi,
This change also breaks my shutdown script (Slackware 8.0).
This script contains:
if [ "$1" != "fast" ]; then # shutdown did not already kill all processes
  killall5 -15
  sleep 5
  killall5 -9
fi
It never gets beyond that point, probably because the script itself is
zapped. According to killall5 manual the processes in its own session are
unaffected by this, but that doesn't seem to be entirely true.
Granted, reboots are rare with Linux, but having to fsck every time from
now on is not my notion of fun ;)
Regards,
Udo.
