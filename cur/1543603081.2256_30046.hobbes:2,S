Plain simply wrong - Linux has more than 50% in the "Internet 
server market" (even if some company's propaganda department's do not 
admit this).
Attacker choose the weakest target (this is usually also the largest, 
but not necessarily).

It is "the details" that matter in this area.
M$ sells their software with the "everyone can install it, use, etc. 
because it is user-friendly[0], it does exactly what the user needs, 
it does everything automatically, etc." argument (which is plain simply
wrong[1]). 
Therefore lots of people install and run servers on the web without really
knowing what they are doing. Apparently they think that they install 
it and it runs on its own (which is wrong).
The learning curve on a U*ix system with some appropriate server 
software on it s much steeper. So if you get such a system on the web
you are forced to know more about it (and usually at one point 
you get to people who basically force you to think about security or 
other areas).
You could run a "secure" Win*server or workstations on the Net, but his means
that
-) you install all relevant patches immediately (not ASAP - immediately).
-) you disable all kinds of automatic code execution features (which
   means disabling all the nifty features, setting all hosts to 
   "internet zone", disable Active-X and JavaScript[2] completely, etc.).
If you would do this, you could as well run the service on a U*ix 
system because the functional features are the same and you get 
patches much earlier (how long took the tear-drop patch for WinNT ?).

You should also list the disadvantages, not only one argument if you 
you want to be serious.

Read the usenet and you will see a significant difference.
Until then you are trolling.

[0] : Does anyone know why there are that much Win*-Books on the
      shelves if the software is so easy to use ?
[1] : If a server is badly administered the sysadmin of that server is
      also partly guilty (even if he didn't have a clue) - you should 
      also blame them.
[2] : This should actually be disabled on all browsers on the world.
      Actually this should be removed completely.
