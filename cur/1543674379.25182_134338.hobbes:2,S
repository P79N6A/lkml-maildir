I thought everybody used the CMOS clock in UTC, which means that the
kernel doesn't have to know anything about nasty little details related
to timezones, daylight savings time and such. Localtime is just a
presentation issue.

All your disks are typically still mounted readonly and no important
applications are running except for perhaps an fsck /dev/root between
the time the system is booted and the clock is fixed up. So it really
doesn't matter whether your clock is off by a couple of hours for a
couple of seconds (a minute?) during boot.
