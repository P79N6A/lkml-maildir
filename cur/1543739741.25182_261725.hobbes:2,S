sure, we could do that. But since there are other architectures with
large irq-vector spaces too, you might want to try to move it into the
generic IRQ code and just provide a way to switch between 1:1 mapped and
sparse-mapped variants.
(of course this still means all of the direct indexing in kernel/irq/*.c
would have to change.)
