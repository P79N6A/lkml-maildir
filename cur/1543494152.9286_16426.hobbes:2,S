I have a question on this (since I have the same problem as well).   Does it
lockup only when there's lots of traffic?  This card seems to cause
collisions.  If I transfer files at around 900kb/sec, the col light on the
hub is 99% solid.  (takes a 10ms break every now and then <g>)

eth0 is a pci 3com, eth1 is an isa 3com
(eth0:3c905  eth1:3c509  seems like 3com likes to make their stuff
confusable easily <g>)
The said machine here is:
Tyan s1654d
2 233mmx cpus (p55c)
192mb ram
2 adaptec aha2940u
1 diamond stealth S3
1 3com 3c905 (pci)
1 sb16 ViBRA pnp
1 generic 33.6k modem
1 3com 3c509 (pci)  Not sure if this is a b or not.
