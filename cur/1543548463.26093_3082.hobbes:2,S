The system call is needed of course, since that lets Linux executables
(perhaps ones being ported from Win32) use the new features.
You might as well also handle int 0x2e with the same code.

See www.sysinternals.com for some native API documentation.
In addition to the web site, there are articles and a book.
The native API is generally better for Linux, because it is smaller
and less bloated than Win32. Putting Win32 in the kernel is almost
like putting libc in the kernel. You can make exceptions for calls
that need the greatest performance and/or don't translate well.
