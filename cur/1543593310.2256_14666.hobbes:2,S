patch-2.4.5-ac7.bz2 behaves the same as 2.4.4.  Whatever is happening in
IO-APIC setup, USB interrupts actually arrive on IRQ 12.  I can include
the usual pile of config info and boot messages, but they look the same
as previous l-k postings.
Since IRQ 12 is a popular destination for USB, the following patch may
work for people with this problem:
--- usb-ohci.c	Sun May  6 08:42:51 2001
+++ usb-ohci.c.rico	Mon Jun  4 20:49:56 2001

-	return hc_found_ohci (dev, dev->irq, mem_base, id);
+	return hc_found_ohci (dev, 12, mem_base, id);
 } 
If 12 fails, they can look for the stray interrupt in /proc/stat.
