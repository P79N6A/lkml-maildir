Yep, that's exactly what I'm doing; RHEL4U2 with a 2.6.14 or 2.6.15
kernel.  Thanks for the tip, that should help me investigate further!

Sounds like this is another of example of system support programs
(insmod in this case) breaking with modern kernels.  Hopefully now
that Linus has laid down the law about how breaking userspace is
uncool, people will agree that it's a bug.  (That is unless Red Hat
made some kind of incompatible change and it's Red Hat's fault, but I
kinda doubt that.)  Anyway, I'll look into this some more and see why
you can't use a mainline kernel with RHEL4, at least not in this
configuration.
