And besides, where else can you have the fun of drilling out that stubborn
cover screw, and the fun of bashing up a set of platters with a hammer?
It's almost too bad we don't have any of those glass plattered IBM's, I'd
like ot see how they take a hammer.  Maxtor 13.6 gig drives just get
banged up a lot, nothing special like shattering or anything.
I should run a drive over to one of our 400 ton TOS presses, and see if
"pancake thin" is possible.
