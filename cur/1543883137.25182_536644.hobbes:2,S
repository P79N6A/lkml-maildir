I reconsider this patch. It was wrong. Because it is overkill to
unregister filesystem just for hugetlbfs_vfsmount mount failure.
Because hugetlbfs_vfsmount is only used for shumget() system call
and also there is some race condition between register_filesystem()
and unregister_filesystem(). (it's not likely happen though)
So what we can do for hugetlbfs module_init failure is
adding NULL check for hugetlbfs_vfsmount in hugetlb_zero_setup().
