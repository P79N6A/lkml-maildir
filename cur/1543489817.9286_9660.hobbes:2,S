What really happens is:
app calls connect()
	socket is set to SS_CONNECTING
-> signal
ICMP happens in between
connect is restarted
sees sk->err returns and clears error but does _not_ set SS_UNCONNECTED
application retries connect
inet_wait_for_connect (because the socket is still SYN_SENT)
	-> sleeps forever because no wake up happens and no error 
	   is set because it is already cleared.
Here is the better fix which always clears SS_CONNECTING, I'm still
waiting for Jason's feedback on this one. Seems the "fix" to move
the tcp_set_state(TCP_CLOSE) out of the icmp error handler was worse
medicine than the original problem. 
I also commented some other problems for later fixes:
Now still to find the pkt_too_big to self and copied < acked problems
Jason reported. Alexey, do you have a theory for the pkt_too_big to
self?
