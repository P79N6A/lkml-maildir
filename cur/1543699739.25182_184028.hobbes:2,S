Heh. I may not comment my code much normally, but for the last few weeks
I've been aiming for one-liners, and making sure that I can read every
single patch and say with some comfort that I can pretty much _guarantee_
that the patch is right.
I'll go back to my lazy ways in 2.7.x, I'm sure.
Anyway, even if I think the patch is "obviously correct", can you do me a
favor and test it on the load that you've seen failing? Just to be anal.
