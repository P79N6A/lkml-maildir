Hmm, I don't think that post made it near linux-usb-devel ... :)
If the problem is just that the driver isn't loaded, but works if it's
modprobed by hand (or statically linked), then it's a hotplug problem.
Likely the same one that prevents _real_ CDC Ethernet devices from
hotplugging.  See if the attached patch improves things.
Alternatively, I understand that the 2.6 based OpenZaurus code is
starting to work quite well on those models.  You could upgrade
from that old Lineo/Embedix code, and gain the ability to talk to
Windows using RNDIS networking for free!

Are you saying Linux is saying something about "750/760"?  Where?
Current usbnet versions only say "Sharp Zaurus, PXA-2xx based".
Maybe the Lineo/Embedix code is mis-identifying itself.
