I don't think we're at that point yet --- it's hard to write a design
document when you don't have an agreed-upon set of objectives yet....
What might be useful would be a summary document listing the various ideas
that have gone by, with pointers to the messages expounding them (via links
to kernel list archives).  Possibly that would help avoid the
devfs-thread-ish "is everyone talking about the same thing?" problem.
