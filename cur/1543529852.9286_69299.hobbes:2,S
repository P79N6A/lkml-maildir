	Hi.
	This is interesting. Quite a few people are unable to use demand 
dialing with pppd 2.3.11 and the kernel.
	In my setup, pppd works with demand dialing.  
pppd-2.3.10,modules-2.3.6(modutils package in suse 6.3).
Probably this is a pppd 2.3.11 problem ? Can you verify that ?
My modules package is also a bit out of date (recommended 2.3.7)
 -- but still works.
     regards,
