That's a completly orthogonal issue not related to the !TASK_RUNNING
discussed issue. While I checked the code myself I only verifyed the
effect of returning in TASK_RUNNING state from GFP and indeed select is
robust against that.
select is instead not rubust if GFP returns NULL and that's a completly
different thing ;)).
So basically your patch was not fixing the bug you was thinking about, but
it was incidentally and perfectly fixing another completly unrelated bug,
fun ;). Thanks for noticing this.
