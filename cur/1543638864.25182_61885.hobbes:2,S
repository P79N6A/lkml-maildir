Different thing about 810, brand spanking new Compaq
Game^H^H^H^Hlaptop and it gives good sound, but shows this on boot:
i810: Intel ICH3 found at IO 0x4400 and 0x4000, IRQ 5
i810_audio: Audio Controller supports 6 channels.
ac97_codec: AC97 Audio codec, id: 0x4144:0x5363 (Unknown)
i810_audio: AC'97 codec 0 Unable to map surround DAC's (or DAC's \
not present), total channels = 2
lspci -vvv shows this:
00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801CA/CAM AC'97 Audio (rev 02)
	Subsystem: Compaq Computer Corporation: Unknown device 004a
	Control: I/O+ Mem- BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
	Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
	Latency: 0
	Interrupt: pin B routed to IRQ 5
	Region 0: I/O ports at 4000 [size=256]
	Region 1: I/O ports at 4400 [size=64]
Under Windows XP it likes to call itself a SoundMAX device.
Hope its of help?
