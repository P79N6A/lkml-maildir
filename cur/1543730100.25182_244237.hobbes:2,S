Ok.. Idea time..
Can you add another linux box in there. Something like
Client (192.168.0.30) ---> Box1Eth0(192.168.0.1) SNAT Box1Eth1(192.168.1.99) ---> 
Box2Eth0(192.168.1.100) () Box2Eth1(192.168.77.99) ---> HorridBuggyBox(192.168.77.1)
With Box 1 doing the NAT and Box 2 having the patch and just doing normal routing.
Have a route in Box 1 set to send 192.168.77.0/24 to the gateway at 192.168.1.100 which will know to 
send anything destined for 192.168.77.1 out eth1.
If I try it, it's going to work fine as I don't have a box that munges IP's like yours does so I 
can't provide a full test. (I guess I could butcher another UML to do it if I really had to)
Doing this stuff is so much easier when you have the faulty device in front of you. Your not in the 
UAE by any chance ;p)

Brad
