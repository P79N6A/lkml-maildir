        If I run "make oldconfig" under linux-2.5.69-bk12
and select "m" for CONFIG_USB_GADGET, I am asked a question
or two about USB gadget interfaces that I might want, and
then the build process gets into an infinite loop.  If I set
CONFIG_USB_GADGET to "n", then everything is fine.
        I expect there is no input that is supposed to cause
"make oldconfig" to go into an infinite loop, so this must at
least be a kconfig bug.  Here is a transcript of the interation
that leads to the infinite loop:
Support for USB Gadgets (USB_GADGET) [N/m/y/?] (NEW) m
  USB Peripheral Controller Support
    NetChip 2280 USB Peripheral Controller (USB_NET2280) [N/m/?] (NEW) m
  USB Gadget Drivers
    Gadget Zero (DEVELOPMENT) (USB_ZERO) [N/m/?] (NEW) m
    Ethernet Gadget (USB_ETH) [N/m/?] (NEW) m
[Infinite loop starts here.  The following lines repeat forever,
non-interactively.  They just go scrolling by.]
