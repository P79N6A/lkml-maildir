Well, it does: it adds complexity in that yet another boot loader
needs to be maintained for merely the occational use.  Furthermore, it
is a very problematic such, since figuring out the geometry of a
floppy from the BIOS is impossible, and there is no installer program
to tell us, we have to guess.
