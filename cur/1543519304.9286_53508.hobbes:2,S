chmod u-s ping
I doubt you'll see a 2.0.39 kernel come out the doors.  Alan is
maintaining 2.2.x right now, and looks like 2.3 is entering code
freeze, so 2.4 will be out in a few months.  The likelyhood of
anyone maintaining 2.0.x is slim, or at best - slow.
Also, if you are using a patched kernel with ANY external
patches, it is unlikely anyone will care much about any problems
that you have, except perhaps the authors of the patches.  If you
can replicate any problems on a stock kernel, you may get some
answers though.
Good luck!
