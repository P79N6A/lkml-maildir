I was thinking something like this:
+void percpu_counter_mod_ul(struct percpu_counter *fbc, long amount)
+{
+       preempt_disable();
+       __percpu_counter_mod(fbc, amount, BITS_PER_LONG<=32);
+       preempt_enable();
+}
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(percpu_counter_mod_ul);
where the check for unsigned long overflow is only turned on 32 bit
platforms.

Well, don't we have the problem : 64 bit counter add/dec/update is not
always atomic on all 32 bit platforms? There are risk that we will get
bogus global value.

yeah...I am not so happy with the extra "ul" checking flags either. But
as you have mentioned before, the signed global counter type is there
for some cases when the global counter becomes temporally negative
( although the counter in real life should always positive). What should
we do if the global counter is a unsigned value, was initialized to 0,
and now we add -5 to it(-5 is from one local counter, then we will get a
bogus big value)?
ext3 free blocks counter is always initialized to a big positive value
so I doubt above concern is a real issue for ext3. Perhaps you thought
this through that it's okay to change the global counter to unsigned
long for other applications of PCP counters?
Thanks,
Mingming
