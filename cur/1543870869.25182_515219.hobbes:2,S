slightly, with LD_BIND_NOW=1 the dynamicly linked version goes up to 3000 
connections/sec, gaining back about half the difference.

thanks, this makes sense.

definantly, any cost that can be moved to startup instead of the per-connection 
handling pays off _very_ quickly

the version of time on my system (debian 3.1) doesn't give me the cpu or 
pagefault info, just the times. where should I get the version that gives more 
info? (although I don't think I can apply it directly to my troubleshooting as 
the work is all being done in child processes).
