Why not add a config option to choose between code for two behaviors:
(1 being the default, of course)
1. Current behavior, usualy a Good Thing, sometimes a Bad Thing, I've 
had apps that had to call up in their entirety from swap space, while I 
still had plenty of "avalible" RAM left ("avalible" meaning free, and 
cache/buffers.) It seems the kernel puts a higher priority on caching 
and buffers than on memory that hasn't been accessed in a while, which, 
as I said, is usualy good, but not always.
2. Don't swap ANYTHING to disk until avalible RAM drops below, say, 
15%. And put cache on a sanity check; if the system is going to swap to 
disk because avalible RAM drops below 15%, and  cache makes up more 
than, say, 45%, start dropping the oldest stuff in the cache to free up 
RAM instead of swapping. (I'm assuming 128-256MB+ of RAM here, for 
anything smaller, default is probably best.)
At the very least, I'd like to see #2 tried, if someone that knows the 
VM system has time to spare on it.
Cache/swap practices in the kernel have been bugging me for a long time.
