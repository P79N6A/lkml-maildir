Framebuffer console _is_ quite late compared vgacon or even
early_printk, all the basic stuff is already up+running at that point.
I think initialization in early userspace can be done in a way that
it wouldn't delay the initial console display compared to todays vesafb
(or any other framebuffer).  Of course you need some way to turn it off
and use vgacon instead ...
