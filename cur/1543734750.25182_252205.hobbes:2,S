Subject: [PATCH] PWC driver without binary interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
 I've made a patch to (re)add pwc philips driver into the kernel. This driver
have support for some compression mode (for chipset 2 & 3), so you don't
need the binary module to grab an image in 640x480@10fps.
Use this driver with caution, i've test on several webcam (type 730, 740).
Mode bayer is not implemented, the camera only output yuv420p (planar mode).
Future plan is to improve compatibility with other webcam, and try to
implement decoder for version 1.
 As wish by the original author, i've remove email address for the support, and
add a disclaimer "this is unofficial version".
 The patch is 300kbytes long, i don't include it in this mail. You can found
 a tarball or a patch against the last linux kernel at:
