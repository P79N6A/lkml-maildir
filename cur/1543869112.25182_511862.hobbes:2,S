Didn't test but I did bisecting and after reverting commits:
e8363f332757ac22395fb120cc33b3262f9ee26c
and the main problematic one:
commit 0a6139027f3986162233adc17285151e78b39cac

    ACPI: Thermal issues on HP nx6325
    The previous reference counting scheme to enable power resources
    got confused when multiple devices were present that might
    repeatedly enable or disable the resource and throw off the count.
    The new code simply lists the referencing devices which
    are requesting the resource to be enabled.  When there are none,
    then it is off.
