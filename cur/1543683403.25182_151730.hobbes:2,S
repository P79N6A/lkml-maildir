Kudos to CK
In 2.4.21 galciv + wine was fine.
In 2.4.21 + CK patches, galvic + wine would pause every 15 seconds or so 
(maybe it was when little animations played).
In 2.6.0-test1-mm2 (vanilla, or + 08) Galciv would stutter horribly and 
freeze my machine in wine. It might run smoothly until I loaded a 
nautilus window or something then stutters and loss of control of the 
system.
With 09, it is smooth as silk until I do something and then the video 
playbacks can be choppy but the game (turn based strategy) seems to run 
without the long pauses of 2.4.21 CK or 2.6.0 vanilla. I can switch 
between apps and go back without any problem.
09 seems to be a big improvement for whatever caused the stutter & die 
problems in wine+galciv.
