The 6.2.15 driver off 
http://prdownloads.sf.net/e1000
 will enable it
by default.  We've gone through our release approval, which includes
quite a bit of testing.
If the patches posted recently don't include that support, I missed
something :-)
This is only on the 82571 and greater hardware that packet split is
supported, BTW.
