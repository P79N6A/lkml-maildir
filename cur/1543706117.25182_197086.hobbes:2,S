Thank you for your reply.
I don't have the performance problem with USB2.0, it read a file lightning
fast (compare with USB 1.0), but just hang shortly after a few files.
I using USB 1.0 as a work around, but my disk is 120G and the speed is
terrible.
Because the command " lspci " show the PCMCIA bus correctly, I didn't
thought it could be a problem. If it is the case, what can I do?
