There are currently several attempts discussed to push out the
BKL and replace it by a semaphore e.g. the next step Robert Love
planned for his ll_seek patch (replace the BKL by inode i_sem). 
The naive replacement BKL -> semaphore is surely bad.
Now on the other extreme you may always find a splitting of
the data you want to protected into short locked and long locked
sections like Christoph Hellwig suggested for i_sem:

But this approach needs a lot a proper documentation and discipline.
So for most BKL removal work I suggested the combi-lock which scales
better than a semaphore but is more manageable than splitted locking.

P.S.: I posted the combi-lock as a practical RFC to bring the discussion
about lock scalability, latency and possible preemptiblity of the
linux kernel back to a concrete technical level (if you look at the 
"[2.4.17/18] VM and swap - it's really unusable" thread some weeks 
ago you can surely imagine why). And the simple reason is that for
my real time data acquisition systems I really would like to get rid
of my SunOS 5.8 and W2K machines. But the truth is that the standard
linux kernel is a real (worst case) latency hog even when compared with
these two bloated OS, at least for my applications. Only Andrew
Morton's (full)-ll patch boosts linux to comparable performance 
(less than 1-2 ms latency under heavy io-load). (I know that SunOS 5.8
and W2K also can have larger latencies under special circumstances,
but not for a simple streaming data acquisition with some online
visualization).
