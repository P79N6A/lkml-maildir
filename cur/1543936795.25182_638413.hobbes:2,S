While being able to deal with used-once mappings in page reclaim
could be a good idea, this would require us to be able to determine
the difference between a page that was accessed once since it was
faulted in and a page that got accessed several times.
That kind of infrastructure could end up adding more overhead than
an immediate reclaim of these streaming mmap pages would save.
Given that page faults have overhead too, it does not surprise me
that read+write is faster than mmap+memcpy.
In threaded applications, page fault overhead will be worse still,
since the TLBs need to be synchronized between CPUs (at least at
reclaim time).
Maybe we should just advise people to use read+write, since it is
faster than mmap+memcpy?
