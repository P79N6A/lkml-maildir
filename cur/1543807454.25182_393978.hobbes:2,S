That'll help naturally, 128k sync blocks will be very close to async
performance for most cases. Most cases here being drives with write back
caching enabled, if that is disabled async will still be a big win.
Is there any reason _not_ to just go with async io? Usually the code is
just as simple (or simpler), since the in-kernel stuff is inherently
async to begin with.
