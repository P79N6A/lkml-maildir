name_to_dev_t needs to be non-init in order to make it possible to
trigger a resume when the block device driver isn't static. Pavel, would
you be willing to consider a patch to make it possible to trigger swsusp
resume from userspace? That gets things working with initrd kernels.
I've been using something along these lines for a few weeks now, and it
hasn't eaten my filesystem yet.

Yes, I was thinking of this mostly from a distribution perspective.
There's always potential for data-loss if users resume after touching
the root filesystem. On the other hand, it's currently possible for them
to do that anyway (think booting a different kernel without swsusp
support, then rebooting back into the swsusp one)
