Subject: RFC [PATCH] pdc202xx configure help

Folks,
I've been working on the pdc202 driver having had some problems getting my new 
gigabyte MB running sweetly. The following patch fixes the configure help to 
be, well, more helpful. I hope this is useful.
In the text, I have referred to the two configure options I have renamed in 
another patch that I'll be submitting tonight also. These can, of couse, be 
left as-is.
Ruth

   This driver adds up to 4 more EIDE devices sharing a single
   interrupt. This add-on card is a bootable PCI UDMA controller. Since
   multiple cards can be installed and there are BIOS ROM problems that
   happen if the BIOS revisions of all installed cards (three-max) do
   not match, the driver attempts to do dynamic tuning of the chipset
   at boot-time for max-speed.  Ultra33 BIOS 1.25 or newer is required
-  for more than one card. This card may require that you say Y to
+  for more than one card, and this card may require that you say Y to
   "Special UDMA Feature".
+
+  If you have a RAID-capable controller, such as the PDC20276, it will
+  be used as a plain IDE controller unless you say Y to 'Do not use
+  software RAID device as plain IDE controller' and also say Y to the
+  Promise software IDE RAID controller. If you do this, the IDE driver
+  detects the controller during startup, but ignores it.
 
   If you say Y here, you need to say Y to "Use DMA by default when
   available" as well.
