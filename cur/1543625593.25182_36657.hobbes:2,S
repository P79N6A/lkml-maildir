Subject: Linux tuning issue for udp live streaming application

Hi there.
We are currently implmenting the live streaming solution on Redhat 7.2
(Kernel 2.4.18) + 1 Gigabit NIC(Intel Pro/1000 XF Server Adapter). Our
solution transfers a 1Mbps data to many receiver using UDP protocol.
We want to have the better performance than 500Mbps throughput measured for
testing .
I want to know the tuning issues suitable for our solution. Also, we want to
use a zero-copy api of udp, but we don't know usage of the api and whether
it is support on Linux kernel 2.4.18. If it is supported, how can I find it.
Please let me know the information.
Thanks in advance.
