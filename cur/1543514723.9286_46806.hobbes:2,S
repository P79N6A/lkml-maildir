I'm not sure if this is really necessary.

This is *not* a memory test. It's a memory map veryfier. I wrote a good
memory test that uses special access patterns to stress test the whole
memory subsystem. It takes half an hour on my 64MB machine to complete.
That's to slow for a standard bootup. And I'm still not satisfied with it.
The memory map veryfier is designed to detect wrong "mem=xxx" parameters,
buggy BIOSses and memory holes (eg. from 15M to 16M). And it seems to work
reliably.
