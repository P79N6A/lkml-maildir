You didn't read my post to that same thread did you:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=kernelnewbies&m=102130770415962
And for the most part, the people on kernelnewbies have given up on
trying to explain to new people why this does not work.  I know I sure
have :)

No.  See the LSM mailing list archives for why we did not decide to do
this.  (hint, you don't really achieve what you want to by doing this.)
If you _really_ want to hook things like this, look at LTT or dprobes.
They should work just fine for you.
thanks,
