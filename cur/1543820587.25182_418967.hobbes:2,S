But blk_recount_segments() sets the BIO_SEG_VALID flag. Ugh ok
__bio_add_page() basically kills the flag. James, I think you are the
author of that addition, does it really need to be so restrictive?
        /* If we may be able to merge these biovecs, force a recount */
        if (bio->bi_vcnt && (BIOVEC_PHYS_MERGEABLE(bvec-1, bvec) ||
            BIOVEC_VIRT_MERGEABLE(bvec-1, bvec)))
                bio->bi_flags &= ~(1 << BIO_SEG_VALID);
with that in place, we may as well just remove ->bi_phys_segments
and ->bi_hw_segments since we'll be calculating the values over and over
again while building up a bio.
