Not really. It depends on 'how in sync' kapm-idled is running with other
processes. It's easy to monitor on the laptop as the bios changes the color of
a LED during idle calls. Quite often when the laptop is nearly fully idle (a
bit of CPU for kmix and the dhcp client, easily verified with top) there are no
idle calls. When there's idle calls in this state (0.00<load<0.1) it's always
less than 50% idle time.
Maybe taking the load average into account for going idle or introducing some
jitter around HZ for the kamp-idled sleep can help.
What may irritate other people furthermore is that if the system idles via
kapm-idled this is accounted as system cpu time instead of idle time so it does
look like the system is constantly under load when it actually does idle calls.
