On such huge memory machines I guess you have no choice but scale down the 
dirty limits for them to be "equivalent" with reference to IO device speed.
And as Martin says it depends on the workload also.

Huh, that changes the meaning of the dirty limits. Dont think its suitable
for mainline.

Now that must work - if its not we have a problem.
