Just remove this check, because it is uncessary, or try this one
instead
if (freed < mm->rss) 
   mm->rss-=freed
else
   mm->rss=0;
   
Which would be the correct (saturation) behavior for this
substraction.
PS: We do _NOT_ have to check "freed < 0", because that can't
   happen according to the code path. I wonder why the
   zap*-functions return "int" instead of "unsigned int"
   anyway. Error conditions in future releases?

Unnecessary. The below line would be sufficient, because there is
no underflow in unsigned values, that is below 0 but is often
above the maximum value set (size in this case).
+   if (offset > size) {
That's why I prefer to use unsigned values whereever I can BTW,
because I can omit one bound check ;)
