Yeah but you didn't answer my question: why do we track every memory 
address instead of slab objects? What's the benefit? Like I already said, 
tracking slab objects would require much less memory which makes the 
thing more practical. It also reduces the number of false positives (the 
CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE problem). And we already have slab poisoning to 
cover the cases we would not catch with this scheme.

Yes, and what I proposed is as a potential optimization. Debugging aids 
need to be fast enough to be practical.
