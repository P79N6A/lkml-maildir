Subject: [PATCH 02 of 31] xen: fix UP setup of shared_info
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/18/18

We need to set up the shared_info pointer once we've mapped the real
shared_info into its fixmap slot.  That needs to happen once the general
pagetable setup has been done.  Previously, the UP shared_info was set
up one in xen_start_kernel, but that was left pointing to the dummy
shared info.  Unfortunately there's no really good place to do a later
setup of the shared_info in UP, so just do it once the pagetable setup
has been done.
[ Stable: needed in 2.6.24.x ]
