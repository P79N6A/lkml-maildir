There exists sufficient precedence and case law to assert this position 
as accurate. It would take
a patent infringement case where GPL code was being distributed to 
establish it as a matter of law.
I can guarantee Novell and M$ will avoid any such suit for that very reason.
It may all be moot and not really matter, other than for FUD factor by 
Novell/M$.
