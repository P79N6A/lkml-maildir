Ah.. note that some changes in mainline I've folded back into CVS
rather than the other way around.  Also, in the process of the merge
I've made some whitespace and other such cleanups which I've folded
back into CVS.  Your TODO patch has bogus diffs reverting those
changes, so you'll want to update your CVS tree and rediff.
