It seems there's a problem configuring alsa with menuconfig, which the 
.log file of changes through mandrake RPM install fails to account:
 Upon being in make menuconfig, editing the alsa configuration, one 
happens upon this error. Please note, the changelog for this .18 kernel 
reports alsa issues have been resolved... are you also getting this same 
error?
---
 Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
 configuration files and is unable to continue. Here is the error
 report:
 
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu73: command not found
 
 Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>. You may also
 send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
 
 Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
 which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
 
 make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
