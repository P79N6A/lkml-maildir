Subject: [PATCH] Mark CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE as BROKEN
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

OpenBSD doesn't see "." correctly in directories created by Linux.
Copying files over several KB will buy you infinite loop in
__getblk_slow(). Copying files smaller than 1 KB seems to be OK.
Sometimes files will be filled with zeros. Sometimes incorrectly copied
file will reappear after next file with truncated size.

 	  Say Y here if you want to try writing to UFS partitions. This is
