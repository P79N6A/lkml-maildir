In that case, I hope that Con can update the patch to apply to 2.6.21 when 
final is out.  In the meantime I've not had usable luck with -rc1 
nor -rc2  rc1 didn't want to boot after uncompressing, and rc2 is about 
as fast as a 3 day old carcass.  And beating on it doesn't help, the 
stalls are 30+ seconds at a time.  And nothing in the logs.
