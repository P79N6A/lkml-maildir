Taking the assignment out of the if sounds like a good idea. Adding
parentheses much less so. If people find C's precendence rules difficult
to understand, it doesn't help to give them examples where precedence is
enforced by redundant parentheses as if to suggest they were necessary,
particularly if the intended meaning is obvious (which, I agree, may not
be the case in the original code).

Not quite - the hardware doesn't know anything but AAL5 or non-AAL5.

Then you'd also duplicate a lot of other, common, and quite hairy code.
The driver is complex enough already ...
