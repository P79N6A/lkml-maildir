Subject: [PATCH] modutils-2.1.121: make kerneld work with 2.0.x, &c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/1/18/229

Here is a patch to modutils-2.1.121 which
 - adds the NEW_KERNELD_PROTOCOL define from the 2.0.x linux/kerneld.h
 - undefs the above by default, making kerneld work with 2.0.x (seems#
   sensible as 2.2 uses kmod and people might want to dual boot for a bit).
 - adds some warning / info messages to kerneld, letting people know when
   they've probably done something wrong.
The second one is IMO the important one..
I don't know who maintains this -- I've copied to Richard Henderson as he
was the last person listed in the ChangeLog ..
Does anyone know.. if any kernel versions used NEW_KERNELD_PROTOCOL? I
can only assume earlish 2.1.x releases did, but I'm not planning to download
all the patches to find out..
Cheers,
Steve
