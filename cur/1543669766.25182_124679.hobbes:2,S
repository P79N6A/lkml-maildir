 If the scheduler inside the OS can rely on the drive to have a linear

a little difference in the effectivity of the scheduling.

 AFAIK the Seagate Barracudas implement first-party-dma, which is a
very lightweight implementation of command-queuing; with first-party
-dma, the CPU includes the adresses of where the data for a certain
request is read or written into the request-command so that when the
disk responds to a command, it sends this information back to the
controller. So this chip doesn't have to hold a list of outstanding
requests and their scattered adresses where the data is read from or
written to. Doesn't look very elegant, but that's just in line with
the cheap ATA-concepts.
 And the only controller-chips I'm aware of supporting this features
are the chips fom Silicon Image. But I think that sooner or later,
all SATA-chips will support it.
