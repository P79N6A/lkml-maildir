It should work, but you may need to tell LILO that /dev/hde is the
BIOS's first hard disk by putting this in your /etc/lilo.conf:
disk=/dev/hde
	bios=0x80
or else it will get very confused on boot when it tries to access a
nonexistent disk.
If that doesn't do it, it would be helpful if you could provide a
description of what is happening when you boot, and if LILO is printing
any error messages when you install the boot sector.
And of course your BIOS may need to be specially told to boot from the
Ultra66 in the first place. With my current setup with an older Ultra33
card the BIOS is configured to boot from a SCSI device, which is in fact
the Ultra33 IDE card. (shrug)
