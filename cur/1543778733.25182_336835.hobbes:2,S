next->thread_info we could and should prefetch - but from the generic 
scheduler code (see the patch i just sent).
i'm not sure what you mean by prefetching next->timestamp, it's an 
inline field to 'next', in the first cacheline of it, which we've 
already used so it's present. (If you mean the value of next->timestamp, 
that has no address meaning at all so would lead to unpredictable 
results on some arches.)
next->mm we might want to prefetch, but it's probably not worth it 
because we are referencing it too soon, in context_switch(). (while the 
kernel stack itself wont be referenced until the full context-switch is 
done) But might be worth trying - but even then, it should be done from 
the generic code, like the thread_info and kernel-stack prefetching.

i'd like to keep generic bits in generic code, and only move things to 
per-arch include files if absolutely necessary. next->mm is generic.
