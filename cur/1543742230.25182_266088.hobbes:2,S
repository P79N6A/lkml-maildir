Re: why would we want a user-space interpreter?
I don't see any strong reasons.  This is sort of an indulgent "what if"
topic...
Sure page-able memory is better to use than locked down kernel memory. 
Indeed, if the target system doesn't support ACPI at all, then we could
free all of ACPI's memory (static sizes listed below).  But this
configuration is becoming less common over time, not more common.
And if you've got a tiny system w/o ACPI, you'd probably just build with
CONFIG_ACPI=n rather than running a general-purpose ACPI-enabled kernel.
[ It would be sort of neat if we could built the core ACPI support in
some kind of modular way such that that we could have it at boot-time,
if we need it, but optionally unload it at run-time if it turned out the
target system didn't need it. ]
I suppose that a crash in the kernel-mode-interpreter would kill the
system.  But I'm not aware of any such failures today and we fix those
pretty quickly when they do happen.  From a high-level view, however,
Luming's simplicity=stability argument has some merit when you add in
things like memory leaks, stack overflows and all the other system
killing things that could potentially happen in the kernel.
In the kernel we currently have an issue running AML with interrupts off
-- can't do it b/c arbitrary AML could require allocating memory and
sleeping.  But this issue probably has a solution and by itself doesn't
justify a user-land interpreter.
One could argue that the _policy_ drivers -- the modules listed below
should live in user-space because they implement policy.  This, however,
is a philosophical, rather than practical, argument.
Re: why would we NOT want a user-space interpreter?
We need one in the kernel to boot the system anyway, so why have two?
Synchronization and concurrency in the kernel is well controlled.
No issues with AML accessing arbitrary ports and addresses when running
in the kernel.
