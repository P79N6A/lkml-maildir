I think Arjan's idea about using DMI could be very effective for this
particular touchscreen.

Why? These are separate, one might want to disable touchscreen and keep
quick-point or other way around.

We need to get it integrated right away I think. There just too much stuff
in psmouse that shoudl be used (rate and resolution exported through sysfs,
timeout and resend handling, etc.)
Plus, in your current driver:
- MODULE_PARM is obsolete
- data_lock spinlock is either unneeded or may cause deadlocks since it is
  used in interrupt handler and the other places that are using it do not
  disable interrupts
- it is not necessary to suppress duplicate button events in the driver
  as the driver core will do that for you and it will make interrupt
  handler almost the same as Vojtech's. Btw, I don't think his handler
  has a problem - I would expect touchscreen to send anoter packet when
  finger leaves its surface so untouch will not be lost.
- using interruptible_sleep_on for delays is somewhat inelegant I think. 
- it needs some changes to compile with the latest version of serio.
