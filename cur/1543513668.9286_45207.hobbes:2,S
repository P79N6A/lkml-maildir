I suggest serious 1/2 duplex users use a bit in the printer port to
do the switching anyway, rather than using a modem control line. It
has low delay and therefore does not usually clip off data when
switching.
In any event, you need to know when the last character was trasmitted
before you switch this bit. I modified the TX-routine to switch the
bit when the UART shift-register is empty. When any TX characters are
to be sent, the bit is set on. When the TX shift register is empty
(last byte has been sent), it is set off.
No other modifications are necessary -- and the serial port continues
to work as usual for regular RS-232C.
