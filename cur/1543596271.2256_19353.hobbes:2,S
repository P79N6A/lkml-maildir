Easy.  What's the definition of working set?  Those pages that are frequently 
referenced.  So as the application starts up some of its pages will get 
promoted from used-once to used-often.  (On the other hand, the target 
behavior here conflicts with the goal of grouping together several 
temporally-related accesses to the same page together as one access, so 
there's a subtle distinction to be made here, see below.)
The point here is that there are such things as run-once program pages, just 
as there are use-once file pages.  Both should get low priority and be 
evicted early, regardless of the fact they were just loaded.

The self-balancing way of doing this is to promote pages from the old end of 
the used-once list to the used-often (active) list at a rate corresponding to 
the fault-in rate so we get more aggressive promotion of referenced-often 
pages during program loading, and conversely, aggressive demotion of 
referenced-once pages.
