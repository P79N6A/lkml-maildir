FYI, too, I've looked through my archives and here is a little patch for
gzip's inflate.c (not the kernel inflate.c!!) which prints the needed
amount of heap memory for a gzip archive to stderr.
So you can test it with your kernel images (on $$tmppiggy.gz, just remove
the deletion command in arch/i386/boot/compressed/Makefile)...
BTW, zlib has a limit of 1440 for huffman table length, which means we
should have a heap size of 0x2d00 (8 bytes for struct huft). 
Patch is attached (against 2.2.5, but this shouldn't matter...).

P.S.: I've tested some arbitrary gzip files on my machine and a usage of
      more than 8k heap occurs amzingly often (> 2%)...
