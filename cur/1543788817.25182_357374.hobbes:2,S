Right, sorry. Obviously bad typing on my part. I am running 'dmesg' at
the command line to get the traces. My bad...
Anyway, these latencies seem understood at this point. They are just
the timer that you set in the kernel hacking section. No big deal.
However, none of the messages yet give any clues (that I understand)
as to the cause of the timing misses I'm seeing with 2.6.14-rc3-rt13.
I shall look into a 2.6.14-rc4-rtX tomorrow.
Cheers,
Mark
