I tried it just before, but same result.

I have already tested before the previous posting, but no difference.
However, when the files are copied to a fat32 partition of w2k server,
all files listed.

The original depth is
    //server/e$/1st-dir/2nd-dir/3rd-dir/
tested depths are
    //server/e$/2nd-dir/3rd-dir/     or
    //server/e$/3rd-dir/
but no difference.
If you need some other tests, I will do it.
