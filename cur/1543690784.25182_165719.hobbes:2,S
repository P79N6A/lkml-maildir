With procps-3.1.12 and linux-2.6.0-test5, top and ps reports 0.00 time for
multi-threaded programs.
It seems only the 'main' thread is now visible in /proc, and its cpu time
dont include the cpu time of other threads...
Example :
root      1238  0.0  0.0  2692 1576 pts/1    S    08:13   0:00 /bin/bash
root      1293  0.0  0.0  2692 1576 pts/1    S    08:14   0:00 /bin/bash
root      1298  0.0 19.5 716016 658460 pts/1 S    08:14   0:00 ./server
! THIS process certainly has wrong TIME
