Nevertheless, there are more instances of the bug in recent versions.
For me, version 2.6.10 or 2.6.11 seems to be the big difference, from
1 bug monthly to --suddenly-- 4 weekly.
I'm experiecing that problem too. I have notice that sometimes
"bad_page_state" trigger before the BUG is reported.

I have already installed the instrumentation Dave provided. I'll see how
it goes.
