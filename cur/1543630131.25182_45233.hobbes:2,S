	Hi Jeff,
	Time to dump my current batch of IrDA patches in the
kernel. That will help the current "warning message" squashing
party. Tested on 2.5.15.
	Regards,
	Jean
-----------------------------------------------------------
[FEATURE] : Add a new feature to the IrDA stack
[CORRECT] : Fix to have the correct/expected behaviour
[CRITICA] : Fix potential kernel crash
ir253_smc_msg.diff :
------------------
	        <Following patch from Jeff Snyder>
	o [CRITICA] Release the proper region and not NULL pointer
	o [FEATURE] Fix messages
ir253_long_set_bit.diff :
-----------------------
	        <Following patch from Paul Mackerras>
	o [CORRECT] Argument of set_bit and friends should be unsigned long
		Should fix all compile warnings ;-)
ir253_lsap_cache_fix.diff :
-------------------------
	        <Following patch from Christoph Bartelmus, mangled by me>
	o [CORRECT] replace the global LSAP cache with LSAP caches private
		to each LAP.
		Fix a bug where two simultaneous connections from two devices
		using the same LSAPs would get mixed up.
		Should also improve performance in similar cases.
