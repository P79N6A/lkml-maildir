Sorry, late to this thread.  Look, ide-floppy has to deal with real 
world devices, which simply don't follow nice, written specifications. 
 If we treat these devices as standard ATAPI they simply don't work.
And a bunch of planned features which were waiting for 2.5 but are now 
in limbo until the IDE subsystem is stable enough for me to work on.  
Features include:
Trying again to kill the via chipset/Zip interaction (some people are 
still suffering).
Kevin Flemings media detect work: needs ATA commands because the ATAPI 
command set simply doesn't return the information we need.  Then we can 
make ide-floppy drives work *properly* with devfs.
Handling the "special" BIOS settings around LS-120/240/Zip bootable 
drives.  
Making sure that formatting works properly for non-standard format 
capacities (i.e. 1.44MB in LS-120, 32MB in LS-240)
And yes, I have real users asking for these things.
So to me the problem is not to make everything work as SCSI, because 
that simply isn't true for ide-floppy devices.  They *nearly* work, so 
you can get kludgy, "good enough for command line gurus" working with 
ide-scsi, but there are some funnies.  Does it really make sense to have 
IDE/ATAPI kludges down in the SCSI tree?
I much prefer Linus's suggestion of agreeing on the top level API.  I 
would like to see disks, and removeable media having a single unified 
namespace and set of ioctls so that the different user-space programs 
don't need to worry about if they are dealing with a SCSI, PPA, 
ATAPI-ish, USB, 1394 or whatever comes next drive.  Is that work? yes, 
but it's also about communication and keeping things in the appropriate 
place.  Let me hide the horrible things ide-floppy has to do from 
user-space, and if that means I/we have to completely re-write the 
ioctls etc so be it.
