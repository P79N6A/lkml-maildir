We have tried that, Windows does not like it. The only constellation
where it worked was setting the device descriptor's bConfigClass=0x02. 
RNDIS is a sensitive beast. Do one bit different results in that uggly
"Error 10" message on the Windows side. We saw it when we started with
the driver, we saw it when the driver was half way finished and we will
see it again if somebody tweaks the driver without exactly knowing what
the guys at Microsoft smoked when they designed that protocol :-)
