Try to delete your fs/ directory in your output dir.
Then I expect the same bug to surface again.
I guess it is because arch/x86/ia32/ is built before fs/ and
gcc cannot create directories for the output files and
it is the dependency files that triggers the error as this
is the first file to be generated.
The right fix is to move the build of compat_binfmt_elf to
fs/Makefile as already discussed.
