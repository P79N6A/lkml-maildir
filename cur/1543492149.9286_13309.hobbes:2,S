Nor do the other ext2 extended attributes or ACLs, neither of which can be
done sensibly in userspace.

Because we need a journalled filesystem, and that can't really be done
without breaking compatibility.  It's not a whole new filesystem - it's
just some badly needed extensions to an old one.  It's doesn't require a
complete redesign and reimplementation, but it does require a different
type
reiserfs is looking good, but people want a journalled filesystem soon and
Stephen reckons that he'll be ready for an initial code release within a
month or two.  reiserfs isn't yet officially released (although I note
that ext2 is still nominall at version 0.5b :) and certainly hasn't has
the years of batterning that e2fs has.

So don't use the "ext3".  Stick with ext2 and do the capability stuff in
ELF headers or completely in userspace.  It's not too hard - in ping:
dropcap(CAP_MASK & ~CAP_RAWSOCK);
seteuid(getuid());
or similar.  Personally, I will

No.  The above are not sufficient reason to create a new, incomplatible
filesystem.  There are other good reasons, though, and it would seem to me
a missed opportunity not to throw in the other goodies while you're at it.

We seem to have 3*32 bits spare.  That's enough to extend dev_t, uid_t and
gid_t, but not much more.

ext2 has reserved space for ACLs already.

I'm still waiting for a decent networked filesystem based around a
reasonably extensible protocol.
