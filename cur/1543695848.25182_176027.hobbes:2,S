2.6.0-test9 + bk of 31 Oct.
Do not know, it may be a lilo (22.5.7.2, from gentoo) bug...
I had a flash card mounted (usb reader, 6-in-1 thing, uhci).
Looked over the pics on it, unmounted and removed the card.
Edited lilo.conf, and called lilo:
~ lilo
Reading boot sector from /dev/hda2
Warning: Kernel & BIOS return differing head/sector geometries for device 0x80
    Kernel: 65535 cylinders, 16 heads, 63 sectors
      BIOS: 1024 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors
Fatal: open /dev/sdb: No medium found
sdb is the CF-card:
SCSI device sdb: 63489 512-byte hdwr sectors (33 MB)
sdb: Write Protect is off
sdb: Mode Sense: 00 00 00 00
sdb: assuming drive cache: write through
SCSI device sdb: 63489 512-byte hdwr sectors (33 MB)
sdb: Write Protect is off
sdb: Mode Sense: 00 00 00 00
sdb: assuming drive cache: write through
 sdb: sdb1
Next attempt to run lilo was successful. I can reproduce the problem.
I did not notice this before (in test6, for instance).

There are several suspicious things:
 - why it tries to probe for /dev/sdb (yes, the mass storage driver
   recognizes all slots in the reader at load, but the card was already
   removed!)
 - why probing for /dev/sdb is so special so it terminates (it is not
   mentioned anywhere in lilo.conf)
 - why it enumerates devices at all (there are boot= and root= options in
   lilo.conf). Well, this is more a question for lilo maintainers...
