I'll be damned. This is one of the many pieces people never said much
about. Looks relatively thorough.
I did a few things to keep pmd caching around that look like they got
dropped, but I suppose for a standalone mainline port that's the only
option.
I'm really astounded ppl are going through the trouble of resurrecting
all this stuff. I suppose that means it was valuable to someone.
