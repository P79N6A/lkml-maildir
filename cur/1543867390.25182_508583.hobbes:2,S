Another approach I have been toying with previously was to
include ARCH in .config. But I somehow failed
to get it working and it went on my TODO list.
If kconfig get extended to so it can include Kconfig
files for all archs then it could be a Kconfig
option like anything else to select architecture
and this would also solve your issue.
As for the "export ARCH=i386" proposal this is of no
use for people crosscompiling a lot.
Think of the 'Al Viro' setup with crosscompile for 5+
different architectures.
But as I have no patches this is just cheap talk for now.
