The ACPI PM one is *really* odd as its the same clocksource driver on
both arches. I had Mikael cut out the clocksource frequency adjustments,
and confirmed both i386 and x86_64 are using the same base freq
(confirmed via printks).
It almost seems like when booting x86_64 the ACPI PM counter is running
slowly! 
Len: Have you ever heard of such a thing? It seems quite unlikely...
WRT the HPET freeze issue, I'm still digging there. In that case it
appears the HPET isn't counting, so timekeeping just stops. I was
thinking it might be HRT messing w/ the wrong HPET registers, but so far
that hasn't shaken out.
I'll spend some more time on these today and see if we get any further.
thanks
