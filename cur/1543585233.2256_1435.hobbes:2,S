Actually... that sounds like zone bit recording. As I understand it, that
sort of thing is handled by the floppy controller and isn't under the
purview of the OS. Anyhoo, what really got me on this, is I understand
there will be some new floppy drives out soon that'll do this sort of
thing by default. It allows ~33MB of data on a 1.44MB floppy. (let's just
forget how often disks bo bad here)
Pretty cool if can do it w/o changing the hardware.
