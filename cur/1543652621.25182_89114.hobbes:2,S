Check your socks...
As far as RPC goes the RPC server can choose to drop a request whenever
it pleases by simply throwing it away (eg reading it from the socket and
binning it) depending on its workload. There are actually reasons for
that in some situations (eg if the top requests are all for a volume
that is down its better to throw them away so you can get requests for a
volume that is functional)
