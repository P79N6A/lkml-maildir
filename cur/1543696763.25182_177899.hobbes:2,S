I made the table below for LinuxWorld Expo/Conference in Aug. 2002,
for Linux 2.4.x on 32-bit architectures, so it is a bit out of date,
but it might be helpful or useful.

MOTD:  Always include version info.
Linux 2.4 filesystem limits on 32-bit architectures,
with 4 KB block sizes:
                     ext2/3fs    reiserfs     JFS       XFS#
max filesize:          4 TB&      16 TB$     16 TB$%  16 TB$
max filesystem size:  16 TB&      16 TB&     16 TB$   16 TB$
		                              4 PB&    8 EB&
kernel bldev limit:    2 TB        2 TB       2 TB     2 TB 
Notes:
#: all kernel limits
$: kernel limit
%: 4 KB pages
@: block device limit: 2 TB (or 1 TB if signed)
&: fs limit
Another look at ext2/3fs limits:
  Assumes using 4 KB block sizes on a 32-bit architecture
  (64-bit architecture isn't very limiting).
Largest limiting factor
           |
	   v
Smallest limiting factor
1.  64-bit API limit:  8 EiB
2.  kernel page cache index limit (32 bits) == filesystem block number:
    2^32 * 4 KB = 16 TiB
3.  ext2fs triple-indirect block limit:  4 TiB
4.  kernel block device limit (device sector number):  2 TiB
    (or 1 TiB if signed)
