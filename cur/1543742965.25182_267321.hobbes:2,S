Well, the lock isn't global of course. You might be better off
benchmarking on an old Intel 8-way SMP rather than a 512-way Altix :)
But nevertheless I won't say the lock will never hurt.

If you don't have cold allocations eating hot pages, nor cold frees
pushing out hot pages then it may be worthwhile.
If that helps a lot, then you couldn't you just have hot allocations
also check the cold list before falling back to the buddy?
I admit I didn't look closely at this - mainly the PG_zero stuff.
