Error -16 is EBUSY, which causes the driver load to fail due to the 
"Unable to reserve mem region" message.
This means that the sata_nv driver needed to use PCI BAR 6, but was 
unable to for some reason.  Given that sata_nv uses devres like other 
libata drivers, IMO the likely cause is outside the ATA subsystem (PCI? 
ACPI?).
One workaround to try is setting sata_nv module option 'adma' to zero 
(0), in the hopes that it ignores that final region and work anyway.
