Subject: [Bug 973] 2.6.0-test7 oops in store_stackinfo

Please see bugzilla number 973 for the gory details.  The problem remains 
through Linus' stability release.  Short summary is that if both 
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAG and CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC are defined I get a 
repeatable oops in store_stackinfo.  If one or the other is not defined 
the oops doesn't happen.
