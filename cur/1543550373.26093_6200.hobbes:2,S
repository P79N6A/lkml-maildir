Their normal gcc is 2.96, which I'm sure you have heard 50,000 times now.
RH7 also installs "kgcc" which is gcc 2.91.xx (the same gcc
that comes with RH6.2).
I believe if you set your CC to kgcc, you can possibly compile the kernel.
However, I have not tried this yet.  Has anyone else on this list tried it?

Subject: What is up with Redhat 7.0?
Has anyone tried Redhat 7.0 yet? What a mess.
1) It would not compile stock kernels out of the box. (ends at
compress.S) with a fatal error.
2) Trying to compile the kernel source for 2.2.16 that comes with the
redhat disk (which is very different than the stock 2.2.16) causes my
system come to a screeching halt, no messages, no errors, crashed solid.
I have a Supermicro PIIIDME motherboard with a GeForce2 graphics card,
adaptec 2940UW scsi and seagate UW 9 gig scsi drive.
