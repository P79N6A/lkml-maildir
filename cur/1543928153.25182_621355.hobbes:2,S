So the bug wasn't in git-x86 in 2.6.24-rc3-mm1.
But it might be in there now, as some patches got moved over.
Or it could be git-acpi.  Or lots of other things.

The -mm git tree reimports the plain git-foo.patch files back into a new
git tree, so the commit IDs won't line up.
The way to find the culprit patch in 2.6.24-rc3-mm1 is
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/bisecting-mm-trees.txt.
  It
will be quite quick.

http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/
 is current.  But it probably won't
compile.  I'd suggest bisecting 2.6.24-rc3-mm1 would be easier.
