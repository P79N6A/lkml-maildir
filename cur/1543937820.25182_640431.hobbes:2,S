Unless someone is doing something malicious.  Or if the server is  
repeatedly returning ESTALE for some reason.

We haven't identified a server-side solution yet, but that doesn't  
mean it doesn't exist.
If we address the time stamp problem in the client, should we also go  
to lengths to address it in every other corner of the NFS client?   
Should we also address every other server bug we discover with a  
client side fix?

Because this is a problem that sometimes requires application-level  
recovery.  Can we guarantee that retrying the mkdir is the right  
thing to do every time?

Have you tried this client against a file server when you unexport  
the filesystem under test?  The server returns ESTALE no matter what  
the client does.  Should the client continue to retry the request if  
the file system has been permanently taken offline?

I think we have one right here: should the client retry a mkdir if  
gets an ESTALE?
