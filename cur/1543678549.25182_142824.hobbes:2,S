Wow, someone actually tested it!  I do sometimes wonder.
It turns out that I tested an older version with modules, and only
tested this rewrite with in-built code.  Mea culpa.

<SIGH> I'd forgotten about that; there are about 100 places where this
technique is still used.  The change would be trivial, but this isn't
2.5.lownum anymore.  Workaround incorporated.

I prefer to use pairs[i].init.  Rest applied untouched.
I'll test and release a new on soon...
Thanks!
Rusty.
