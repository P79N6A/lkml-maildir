If Debian enables usbmouse and usbkbd by default in their standard 
kernels, would you be so kind and raise a proper ticket on them not to do 
so? Thanks.
This also makes me to speed up with one of my items on TODO list - rename 
usbmouse and usbkbd to something that wouldn't be so confusing and 
wouldn't make people think that they should enable these drivers if they 
want support for USB keyboards/mice. Will queue this for 2.6.22.
