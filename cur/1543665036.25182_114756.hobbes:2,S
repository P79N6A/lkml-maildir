Hard to tell from a first glance. Current errata kernel (newer than -3) would 
be good. The trace itself alas doesnt answer a lot. If you suspect it may be
RAM and can take the box out of service leave memtest86 running on it for a 
few hours and see what it turns up.
Its one of those apps I'd recommend running on any new production hardware for
a couple of passes before putting it into service
