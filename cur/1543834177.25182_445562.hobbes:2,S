Thanks for the pointer. I think, it is valuable for all XFS users, but 
reading the FAQ with a decent webbrowser on linux (konqueror 3.5.3 and 
firefox 1.5.0.4 in my case) is very painful, due to the overlong lines, 
not to speak of printing such texts. Try yourself: load that page into 
konqueror, hit print, select preview and 'have fun', hmm, suffer..
