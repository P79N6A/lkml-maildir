These patches are on rc1-mm4, which unfortunately contains quite a lot of
-mm-only debugging stuff in slab.c.
Could you please redo/retest these patches so that they apply on
2.6.16-rc2.  Also, please arrange for any bugfixes to be staged ahead of
any optimisations - the optimisations we can defer until 2.6.17.
