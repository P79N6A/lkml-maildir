I have just acquired a card with this chip and the sound driver in
2.1.132( + ac3) works fine except that each sound fragment starts with a
very loud click when /dev/audio opens. The modules are preloaded so it
is not the module loading that causes this. 
Under 2.0.36 I get the click when the module loads, but after that sound
plays fine. It sounds like 2.1.132 is reinitialising the chip each time
the device is opened. 
Can someone give me a clue where to look for a solution?
