Sure, the only problem is that I don't want to pull asm/hw_irq.h
directly from linux/interrupts.h unless all arch maintainers around
verify it's ok, because those headers are a bit of a can of worm at the
moment ...
So I'd rather say that if your arch has a custom version of
hard_irq_disable(), make sure that asm/system.h pulls it in a way or
another. And that's already included.
