Alan,
I see you parse-pieces for the 2.4 code as backports into 2.2 of the
larger ide-patch.  What is it going to take to just accept it?
The ali-driver is straight out of 2.4 or ide-patch with parts of cmd646
taken to actively tune the drive and chipsets.
If it is the issue of the taskfile now in my patch, I will pull it if it
will prevent me from having to carry this monster around.
I am considering the pull of the backport because I do not have time to do
both directions.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
