Subject: Tilt Wheel Mouse Drivers Missing.

There used to be a patch that enabled Microsoft and
Logitech Tilt wheel mice to work in Linux.  Recently
the patch has disappeared from:
http://www.t12.jp/~ryuta/misclab/debian/release/hidinput-tiltwheel-quirk-for-linux-2.6.7.patch
Now people are emailing me if I have it.  I don't,
because of a scratched CD-R.  Does a driver for tilt
wheeled mice exist now?
