thanks for your answer.
I did as you said but no problem (memtest 3.0).
Some more info on the problem:
- file that appeared to be "access denied" are not the files I had been
using. I did not write or read them for some time.
- As I looked at the Changelogs and the changes that provoke this error
could be in test4, test5, test6, since test3 was fine.
- I first noticed the problem when I used cvs to mirror the repository
of mozilla. my entire partition was unusable afterward (I had to rebuild
everything even the super block). note that the problem appeared later
also on another partition (why / when ? I don't know) that I had not
rebuilt at all so it's not related to the rebuilding.
