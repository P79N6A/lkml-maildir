You can just store the different values in userspace before signalling
the futex wakeup, can't you?

You are setting the first futex's word in userspace prior to the first
futex wakeup, right?  Either 5 will detect that and return
immediately, or it will reach 6 and the poll() returns immediately.
No hole there.
( The async token passing flaw is that the _waker_ loses track of how
many succesful wakeups it has sent; this is used by some
implementations of fair semaphores, among other things.  That might be
relevant to POSIX message queues but I do not see that it's relevant
to the two futex problem you described. )
