Is this really true?  The one I uploaded was built on this
machine:
: siamese; dpkg -l libcurl\* | sed -ne 's/^ii  //p'
libcurl3          7.14.0-2       Multi-protocol file transfer library, now wi
libcurl3-dev      7.14.0-2       Development files and documentation for libc
Having said that, a tested patch to debian/control to adjust
Build-Depends is much appreciated.
