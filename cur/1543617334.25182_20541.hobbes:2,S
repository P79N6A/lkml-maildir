   	linux-2.5.2/drivers/net/sungem.c uses devexit_p, which is not
   currently in 2.5.2.  I understand the purpose of devexit_p and I have
   kludged around it for myself.  I am just bringing it to your attention
   so you can figure out whether to remove the devexit_p reference, have
   a workaround for kernels that lack it, or add devexit_p to Linus's tree.
It'll be fixed in 2.5.3, my tree had a whole bunch of 2.4.x stuff in
it which I decided to wipe out because of conflicts like this.
