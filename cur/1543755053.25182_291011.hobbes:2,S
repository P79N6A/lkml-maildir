usb-handoff is a kernel option that enables a PCI quirk routine that
takes the USB controller out of BIOS's hands. Until that is done (the
linux USB drivers also do it, only later), the BIOS owns the USB
controller and tries to emulate a PS/2 mouse and keyboard for systems
which can't handle USB.

Indeed.

System Configuration Interrupt. In addition to SMI (System Management
Interrupt), these are two interrupts the BIOS uses to do its job behind
the operating system's back.

SMM is System Management Mode. It's a special mode of the CPU, which is
entered when a SMI is triggered by some event, like an port write trap
in the case of the emulated PS/2 mouse. 
Using SMM the BIOS can emulate any device it wishes to, and the OS will
think it's real. It's an even more privileged mode than what the OS runs
in.

It also does thermal monitoring, often is used for turning the backlight
off on notebooks, and handling various magic Fn- key combinations.

Before the i8042 keyboard driver gets initialized. That's the important
part, because the handoff stops the BIOS from emulating a PS/2 mouse,
and thus blocking access to the real PS/2 mouse controller.

I don't like the interrupt message, I'll check why it's enabled so
early. It may have a good reason to, as well. Other than that, it looks
very much OK.

Compiling USB 1.1 support does the very same thing as specifying
usb-handoff on the command like - tells the BIOS to keep its hands off
the USB _and_ PS/2 controllers.

No. You can use AUX_TEST event before AUX_LOOP. But I expect it to fail
similarly when BIOS is active.
