There's a difference between trying to handle the user calling 
disconnect/destroy at the same time a call to accept/connect is active, versus 
the user calling disconnect/destroy after accept/connect have returned.  In the 
latter case, I think you're fine.  In the first case, this is allowing a user to 
call destroy at the same time that they're calling accept/connect. 
Additionally, there's no guarantee that the F_CONNECT_WAIT flag has been set by 
accept/connect by the time disconnect/destroy tests it.
