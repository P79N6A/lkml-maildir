Pavel,
	Sorry for the late response. 
	No, it isn't that much code. You are welcome to rip the parsing from
libsmbios. There are about three or so C structs necessary to parse it.
The total code is probably about 30-40 lines. (see
libraries/token/TokenDA.cpp, and libraries/common/TokenLowLevel.h). 
	My only point is that _everything_ that this module does can now be
completely and fully implemented in userspace using dcdbas and
libsmbios. I'm not against fixing the current i8k code, though. I don't
have the time to submit a patch myself, but would be happy to help any
interested volunteers.
