Is this true even for CDROMs in DMA mode 
(DMAed CDROM drives on Pentium+ boxes bugfree or not ?)
Alan, how do you stand to this IDE CDROM DMA  BUG ?

Agreed, and that is the reason because you have to be careful
when doing the tuning.
But users with non-flawed hardware should be able to use the 5th gear.
It would be a bit disappointing to say:
"do not use the CDROM drive while usign your harddisk recording app,
because it might ruin your realtime performance"

Of course I agree 100% : the system should be reliabe and THEN efficient.
