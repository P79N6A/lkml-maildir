Yes.

It doesn't. Mapping needs struct file * and it doesn't care about
fd. mmap() takes a reference to struct file by fd you've passed and after
that we can forget about descriptors - vma_struct holds a reference to
file and that's it.

_Definitely_ no. Hell, unlink() doesn't mean that anything happens with
data - unlink an opened file and if that affects the read/write/lseek
you've found a bug. And mapping is equivalent to having opened descriptors
in that respect.
