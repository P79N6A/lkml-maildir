It is my understanding that the MIPS people are happy with the new
dz.c, since I passed it to them to test and submit.  Since they
submitted it, I think we can assume that they're happy.
So we just need the VAX people to confirm that the new driver works
for them, and then for _someone_ to remove the old driver (either
the MIPS or the VAX people.)
