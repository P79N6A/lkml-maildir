    Problem with this is that `gcc -Wall' will generate a warning when it

    I proposed a little hack which avoided that a while back, but it got
    loudly ignored at.
    #define FMT_IP4	"\001%ld"
    	printk(KERN_DEBUG "foo: src=" FMT_IP4 " dst= " FMT_IP4 "\n", src, dst);
    and then teach vsprintf about control-A's in format strings.
But gcc will still treat ^A as an normal char no? So we will get
warnings with:
	printf(KERN_WARN "foo: src=" FMT_IP4 " frobbed %d times\n",src,count);
I really don't know why the kernel need print accurate addresses
anyhow, it's convenient but no essential -- and working form hex
isn't too bad once you get used to is (+ we can use Lx for the v6
case automagcially).
