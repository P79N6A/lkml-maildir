Subject: rename the ksoftirqd kernel thread.

Precedence: bulk

Marcelo,
Please consider this patch for 2.4.22-pre
It just renames the ksoftirqd kernel thread to be the same as in 2.5.
The side effect is that on machines with > 100 processors the last
number in the thread name doesn't get truncated.  
The patch is against linux-2.4 bk.
thanks
mh
