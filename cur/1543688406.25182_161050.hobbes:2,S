Hmm. It doesn't crash, it locks up solid. (Well the aic7xxx driver sometimes
crashes (spits a huge log of errors, rather), but I'm still not sure if
that's related.)
The box only has two disks, 1.3GHz Celeron (~30W), and other lighter power
consumers. Not exactly a power hungry config. I'm not sure about the power
supply - I think it's a 250W one - I'll have to check.
Accoring to sensors, the voltages do not fluctuate much. Also, the
temperatures are moderate (34.0°C system, 41.0°C CPU).
Power problems are surely possible, but don't exactly sound like promising
lead to me.
