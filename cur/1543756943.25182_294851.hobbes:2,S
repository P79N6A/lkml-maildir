That's not how others are reading it and when we requested clarification
from the legal firm we use for contracts (Fenwick&West if you care) they
said that it could well be interpreted that if you use BK you are giving
up your right to hack on another system.  That wasn't our intent but nor
is it our intent to let you go back and forth.

Do you have any idea how many people are using BK?  If they all asked
for this we'd be passing out more than 200 of these a day for more than
a year.  It's around one per minute.  
We either fix the license or leave it as is, we're not able to do side
agreements with everyone that asks.
