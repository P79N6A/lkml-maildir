Subject: [2.6 patch] remove references to net-modules.txt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/9/3

When I removed net-modules.txt because it only contained ancient 
information I missed that many Kconfig entries pointed to this ancient 
information.
