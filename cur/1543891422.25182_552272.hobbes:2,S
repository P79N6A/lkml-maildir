I'd be the *first* to admit that my kernel-foo isn't perfect, and sometimes I'm
right and sometimes I'm wrong when I review somebody else's code.  I certainly
*hope* that nobody's taking my review as anything more authoritative than "an
actual maintainer might want to look at this".
On the other hand, we don't need a Foo-By: tag for "or otherwise comment".
Phrased differently, if I haven't stuck a "Signed-off-by:" or "Tested-By:"
on it, I'm by default only commenting.  The code submitter can decide I'm right
and fix and resubmit, the maintainer can decide I'm right and toss a NAK. Or
they can both decide I'm full of it and hit the Delete key..
