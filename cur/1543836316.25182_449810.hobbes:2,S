Maximum e1000 frame is 16128 bytes, which is enough before being rounded
to 16k to have a space for shared info.
My patch just tricks refilling logic to request to allocate slightly less
than was setup when mtu was changed.

It is trivial patch and it can be incorrect (especially for small sized
packets), but it is a hint, that 9k jumbo frame should not require 32k
allocation.

Hardware is not affected, second patch just checks if there is enough
space (e1000 stores real mtu). I can not believe that such modern NIC
like e1000 can not know in receive interrupt size of the received
packet, if it is true, than in generel you are right and some more 
clever mechanisms shoud be used (at least turn hack off for small
packets and only enable it for less than 16 jumbo frames wheere place 
always is), if size of the received packet is known, then it is enough
to compare aligned size and size of the packet to make a decision for
allocation.
