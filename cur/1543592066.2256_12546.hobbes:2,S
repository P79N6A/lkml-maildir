And why not let "clear_page()" just do that itself?
The only place that doesn't already do "kmap(page)" is basically
get_zeroed_page(), and the only reason it doesn't do that is because the
whole function is fundamentally not able to handle high memory pages (it
returns a fixed address, not the "struct page *".
But that function is also likely to not care about the extra five cycles
or so of having to do the kmap() by making clear_page() (and copy_page())
always use "struct page *" and do kmap() internally. Because most people
who care about performance are already using other functions (in fact, the
functions that _can_ allocate high memory).
And I hate redundancy, and having different functions for the same thing.

The thing is, copy/clear_page shouldn't exist at all (or rather, the
"highpage" versions should be renamed to the non-highpage names, because
the non-highmem case simply isn't interesting any more).
The highmem special casing used to make sense back when highmem was a rare
special case. These days, we should just get rid of the distinction as
much as possible,
