That's true of the core language.  The reason I moved to 2.0 was that there
are library changes in 2.0 that enabled me to to cut CML2's in-kernel footprint
substantially.

Yes.  By the time 2.5 forks, distros covering an estimated 85% of the market
will carry python2 binaries which the CML2 install script will find 
automatically.  By the time 2.6 forks, we're going to laugh if we ever
remember that we thought this was an issue.

It wouldn't be too difficult.  But it would make the code heavier, and
I'm not clear that it would make anybody happy who isn't already willing
to deal with the design concept.

The world is filled with violence. Because criminals carry guns, we
decent law-abiding citizens should also have guns. Otherwise they will
win and the decent people will lose.
