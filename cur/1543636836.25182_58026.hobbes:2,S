By its own definition proc/meminfo is correct. top could go rummaging in
/proc/slabinfo but its questionable if it is meaningful to do so. The
actually "out of memory" case for a virtual memory system is not "no
memory pages free" nor "no memory or swap free" its closer to "working
set plus i/o buffers exceeds memory size".
That isnt something as easy to visualise or compute as "free"
