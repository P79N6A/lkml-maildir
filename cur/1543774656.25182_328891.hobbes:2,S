Doesn't matter if it is zip of some other compression, the problem is
exactly the same.

See? Exactly what has been demanded by all the "unfair", "ReiserFS-racist",
"shove-any-junk-but-do-not-accept-perfect-filesystems-into-the-kernel" etc
people here on LKML from the very start.

Perfection would be nice, but (IMHO) not required.

OK, I see a week of flamefest going by until you admit it has the same
problemas as compression (Hint: Most encryption compresses first, in order
to give would-be cryptoanalysts less of a toehold via non-uniform
distributions, and having less work to do), and then a whole lot of its
/own/ problems (that somebody can peek at a cached uncompressed copy of my
files is not so bad, if they can peek at my decrypted files I'd be rather
less pleased... and here you have to include a malicious root (Yes, I'm
paranoid. Doesn't mean root is not out to get me.).). Perhaps this can't be
all solved, but the exact boundaries of what /is/ provided, and what
/isn't/ must be made clear.
