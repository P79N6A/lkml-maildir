I don't think it's documented anywhere. Even the old SYSCALL/SYSRET Athlon
application note doesn't say anything about how single step is supposed
to work with this. It's probably an artifact of the first implementation
that has been faithfully reproduced since then.

and a few other calls who use iret, like iopl() or sigaltstack().
Anyways, I don't have any plans to change the 64bit behaviour. gdb will
have to live with a few minor inconsistencies as price for faster system
calls.

The normal syscalls use SYSRET, the special syscalls use IRET. That's required
because SYSRET cannot restore all registers, so sometimes a slow path out
must be taken.
