Before someone takes that the wrong way - Richard Earnshaw worked on
porting binutils + gcc to the ARM architecture.  I worked on converting
that toolchain to work for ARM Linux - supporting the a.out shared
libraries and other Linux specific features.
Changing the ABI was, and still is completely outside my level of
knowledge of gcc.
