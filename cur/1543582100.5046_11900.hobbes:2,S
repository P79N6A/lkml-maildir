I can mke2fs (successfully) on a 270G block device. Yes, of course, I also
get various page allocation failures while this happens but they are not
deadly, i.e. the thing (our volume manager) just retries until it works
and after a while I have a valid (and a very big) ext2 filesystem with 0
processes killed.
The kernel I use is 2.4.2-pre3. The machine has 6G RAM with the 3G given
to kernel virtual. The amount of swap is massive (2G) but it is never
used.
