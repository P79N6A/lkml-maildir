Thanks David and Andi
Hum... get_unused_fd() allocates a file descriptor, not a 'struct file *'
Maybe you meant get_empty_filp(void), that we might change to get_empty_filp(int need_read_ahead)
After reading your suggestions, I understand we still need two slabs.
One (filp_cachep) without the readahead data, the other one (filp_ra_cachep) with it.
static inline struct file_ra_state *get_ra_state(struct file *f)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_READAHEAD
	BUG_ON(filp_ra_cachep != GET_PAGE_CACHE(virt_to_page(f)));
#endif
	return (struct file_ra_state *)(f+1);
}
struct file *get_empty_filp(int need_read_ahead)
{
	struct file *f;
	...
	f = kmem_cache_alloc(need_read_ahead ? filp_ra_cachep : filp_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
	if (f == NULL)
		goto fail;
	memset(f, 0, need_read_ahead ? sizeof(struct file) : sizeof(struct file) + sizeof(struct file_ra_state));
	...
}
file_free() then call kfree() that should find the right kmem_cache_t *
static inline void file_free(struct file *f)
{
	kfree(f);
}
I will provide a new version of the patch in a later mail
