Subject: Kernel 2.6.0-test3: make modules; make modules_install problems

I have downloaded kernel 2.6.0-test3 sources twice (in
case of error) and the problem still persists.  'make
modules' compiles the modules to *.o, but 'make
modules_install' expects them to be *.ko.  Am I the
only one with this problem or does everyone have this
problem?
