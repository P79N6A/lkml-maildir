I disagree vehemently. 
The header file should have 'static things' that for example a
competing driver for the same chip could also use. The "driver
defines" should theoretically be in a separate file. This rarely
happens. 
For SX I have an "sxboard.h" with the defines that are in the HARDWARE
for the board. An "sxwindow.h" with the defines that belong with the
shared memory window that the firmware for the card defines, and an
sx.h which defines the parameters and datastructures of the driver.
This is how I like it.

It's on our todo list to learn how to do this. OK. We'll figure it out.

Agreed. Sorry about this. Lots of cases. 
Quick scan: I agree with you in almost all cases. Will do!
