11 of the 18 architectures that I looked at do some form of their own 
command-line parsing.  There is a lot of arch code that could be saved 
if they could use the __setup mechanisms for this.
As far as the architectures that don't have the command-line 
available, we could do something like this:
void start_kernel(void)
{
         char * command_line;
         extern char saved_command_line[];
	get_command_line_arch(&saved_command_line);
	strcpy(command_line, saved_command_line);
	checksetup(0, ...)
	...
}
The weird ones like sparc could do their prom_getcmdline() in 
get_command_line_arch();
Use of command line in setup_arch:
---------------------------------
alpha	does parsing in setup_arch
  	modifies read command line, in case of INSTALL
arm	has its own command-line parsing function
cris	doesn't use a command line
i386	has its own parse_cmdline_early
	can use command line before setup_arch
ia64	the only thing that happens before the strcopy is unw_init
m68k	does its own parsing
	can modify the cmd line in m68k_parse_bootinfo(), which is
  	  early in setup_arch()
mips	many per-arch setups first
	next after those is cmdline copy
ppc+64	does a bit of its own parsing for the debuggers
s390+x	does its own parsing for mem=, and others
sh	has own early printk
	does its own parsing
sparc	get cmdline from prom call
and 64	does own parsing in boot_flags_init()
	
um	cmdline copy happens after paging_init() in setup_arch
v850	does cmdline copy, first thing
x86_64	does its own parsing for early_printk, and in
	  parse_cmdline_early
