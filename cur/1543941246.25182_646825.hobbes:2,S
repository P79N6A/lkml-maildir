Maybe I haven't looked closely enough, but let's start with some common
assumptions.  Looking at do_wp_page from 2.6.24 (I believe that is what
my work area is based upon).  On line 1559, the function begins being
declared.
On lines 1614 and 1630, we do "goto unlock" where the _end callout is
soon made.  The _begin callout does not come until after those branches
have been taken (occurs on line 1648).
Thanks,
Robin
