I have a program (smatch.sf.net) that checks for certain types of kernel coding errors.  I'm working on one that checks for functions that possibly put too much data on the 8kB local variable stack.  The function UMSDOS_ioctl_dir puts less than 2kB of data so it's probably not a problem.  Especially since it doesn't do that for all code paths.  
What should be the upper limit for how much data a function can put on the stack.
linux-2.5.44/fs/umsdos/ioctl.c 439 UMSDOS_ioctl_dir (14432 bits)
Line            Variable                                 Size
79         struct umsdos_ioctl data;                    (4736 bits) 
177                         struct umsdos_dirent entry; (2048 bits)
178                         struct umsdos_info info;    (2304 bits)
250                 struct umsdos_info info;            (2304 bits)
305                 struct umsdos_info info;            (2304 bits)
