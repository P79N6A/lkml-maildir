Subject: any known issues with leap seconds in 2.6.10?

I'm just wondering if anyone knows of issues with leap second handling in 
2.6.10.  We just had a field incident where a couple of quad-x86 machines went 
down at just before midnight (UTC) on June 30th...which is when leap seconds 
would normally be applied.
 From our logs it looks like something went crazy while holding the xtime lock.
If anyone knows of issues with that code I'd love to hear about it.
Thanks,
Chris
