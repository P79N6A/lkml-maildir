I checked the results of the hdparm on my system and it shows that hda has
DMA on . . .  Hmmm. I have seen a lot of rumblings concerning DMA and IDE
devices in the archives of this mailing list.  Is it possible that the ide
drivers now set up the hardware correctly for the DMA?  But somehow the O/S
does not support ICH4 for other DMA devices?
