I compiled as a UP kernel but it wasn't the cause.
Also, I patched the above fix on 2.4.27-rc4 and
compiled as a UP kernel, but didn't work.
Now I would like to mail to Marcelo Tosatti, too.
Current Status:
 * The driver is tg3.o
 * The problem began with 2.4.27-rc4.
 * DHCP fails.
 * Static IP assignment shows no error, but network is still unreachable.
   ('ifconfig' and 'route add default gw' by hand)
 * DHCP packets are unreachable to DHCP server.
   (I don't know which options are used for tcpdump.
    I hear that 2.4.26 worked but 2.4.27 didn't. PXE's DHCP works. )
 * 'arp' at DHCP server shows a line with <incomplete> status.
 * Compiling as a UP kernel didn't solve the problem.
   (The box is Xeon 3.2 GHz / 1 CPU with hyper-threading)
 * Compiling as a UP kernel with the above fix didn't solve.
 * The error message "HW autoneg failed" appears.
   (But (I think) this message doesn't exist in tg3.c for 2.4.26,
    so I don't know autoneg were successful or not in 2.4.26,
    if helpful I will insert printk() and try.
    The link ups (if 2.4.26) 1000Mbps full duplex, off for TX and off for RX.)
