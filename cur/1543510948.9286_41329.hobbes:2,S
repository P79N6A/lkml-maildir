No.
I wanted to say:
1) if Microsoft optimized their contention behaviour, this does not mean
that they have a contention problem. They just have many developers, and
they want to do something.
If they add it into W2K, it must help. We should check if we could use it.
2) I _guess_ that
- NT has a lower contention than 2.3.18.
- for most operation, the difference won't be huge.
- the filesystem (create, delete, remove) of WinNT is better.
