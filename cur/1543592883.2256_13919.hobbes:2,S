The "easy way out" seems to be physical -> virtual
page reverse mappings, these make it trivial to apply
balanced pressure on all pages.
The downside of this measure is that it costs additional
overhead and can up to double the amount of memory we
take in with page tables. Of course, this amount is only
prohibitive if the amount of page table memory was also
prohibitively large in the first place, but ... :)
