Not all devices are remotely packet based. Later IDE (ATAPI) is, current 
SCSI is, i2o had totally different needs.
Eric is building a nice library, maybe the library for merging/ISA bouncing
should be shared but don't jam the policy into the block layer. For some high
end cards we already have far too much policy in the block layer.
(High end i2o controllers can take 4000 commands at a time from the OS, sort
them, merge them do read/write ordering, disk scheduling and cache optimisation
they do not need the OS doing elevator, merging and other stuff.)
