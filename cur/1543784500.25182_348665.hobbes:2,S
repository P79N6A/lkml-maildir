The best would be to avoid using defaults completely, unless the resulting 
kernel is non-functional (e.g. it doesn't compile or boot).
So far it's still the responsibility of the user to explicitly turn 
everything on he needs (at least until we have a functional autoconfig).
BTW distros are not the only users, from them I would expect how to 
configure a kernel.
