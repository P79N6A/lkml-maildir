No its like x86 with the GFP_DMA zone for < 16M addresses. The special
memory creates an imbalance that sometimes leads to weird VM behavior. I'd
make sure to set GFP_DMA only for devices that actually require < 4GB
memory and only use it if no IOMMU like stuff is available. Its best to
not use GFP_DMA.
