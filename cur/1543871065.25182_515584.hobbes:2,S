thanks. It seems that the 'BUG: soft lockup detected' message does not 
occur in this log though - and that there are bootup messages between 
the two sysrq outputs:
[  221.101833] skge eth1: disabling interface
[  228.740911] audit(1173094442.943:11): user pid=3245 uid=0 
auid=4294967295 subj=system_u:system_r:hwclock_t:s0 msg='changing system 
time: exe="/sbin/hwclock"
(hostname=?, addr=?, terminal=console res=success)'
[  233.148571] md: md1 in immediate safe mode
plus there's trouble with irq 10:
[  132.013194] irq 10: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)
[  132.072771] Disabling IRQ #10
that prompted you to enable irqpoll, right? So am i right that without 
irqpoll there's no lockup?
