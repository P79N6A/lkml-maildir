	Well, I think the best way may be to monitor this mailing list for
patches from kernel hackers, and try out patches that are posted here.  You
may want to start w/ a subset of folks (DaveM, mingo, Alan Cox, Linus, others
who are in the maintainers file..), though it depends...  I tend to watch
those a little closer (Andrea-something, can't spell the name correctly).
	Then basically report back to here w/ info on what happens w/ the
patches, if they work, if they don't why they don't, etc.  If you want to
learn about the kernel, try and piece apart what the patch is doing, and
then if you run into bugs either see about finding a solution on your own,
or watch what others do w/ the patch that fixes it or changes it's behavior.
