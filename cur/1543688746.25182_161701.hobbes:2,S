sure, that's why I said it won't work with synflood. I just doubt the
ping/syn floods distributed denial of services are an high percentage of
the traffic passing through on bkbits.net. I though it was legitimate
traffic, and I assume bitkeeer is somehow efficient in handling the
transfer, by using a single tcp connection for the whole transfer of the
data, just like pserver/cvs-ssh do. For example if bitkeeper would open
a new tcp connection for each file (similar to cvsps -p -g w/o the
--cvs-direct option that I asked for), it would be much harder to shape
that traffic. But I understood the traffic that hurts is all in
established state for several seconds, so it should be technically
possible to stop it to around 1kbyte/sec globally to give an huge margin
to voip.
