I switched to tty1 right after logging in, and after a few seconds
(corresponding pretty well with the time it takes to hit the same spot
where it crashed all previous times) I got a lot of nice crash info
scrolling by.
Actually a *lot* scrolled by, a rough guestimate says some 4-6 (maybe
more) screens scrolled by, and since the box locks up solid I couldn't
scroll up to get at the initial parts :(  So all I have for you is the
final block - hand copied from the screen using pen and paper, so
please excuse any typos I may have made :
Bad page state in process 'kded'

Trying to fix it up, but a reboot is needed

Hope that helps a bit even though it's the last and thus least
interresting block of info.
It never makes it to the logs, and as mentioned previously I don't
have another machine to capture on via netconsole or serial, so if you
have any good ideas as to how to capture it all, then I'm all ears.
