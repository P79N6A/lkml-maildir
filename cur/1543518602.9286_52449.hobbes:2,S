Hi,
A while ago I announced a hierarchical fair scheduler for 2.3. That
work has progressed since then, here are the main changes from the
initial release (detailed changelog available on the website):
- All known issues fixed;
- Support for all architectures, although only i386 has been tested;
- Dropped the HSFQ acronym from all user-visible parts (including
names of system calls). It was hard to even say, let alone remember
what it stands for (hierarchical start-time fair queueing, the
underlying algorithm).
The URL has changed to:
http://people.cornell.edu/pages/bdd2/fairsched/
State of the code: alpha. It's been extremely stable for me, but AFAIK
I'm the only person running it. The SMP support certainly needs
testing on a true SMP machine. If anybody decides to try it out, I'd
be very happy to hear from you.
I've also written a testing utility (also on the website). It does the
following: 1. generates a random scheduling tree with random weights;
2. starts a busy loop in each leaf node; 3. calculates the predicted
and actual work (number of iterations) done by each busy loop and
displays statistics. Here is an example run:
      [root@wispa util-hsfq]# ./fairsched-test 3 20 7
      >  1.00000
      +-8->  0.38462
      |   `-2->  0.38462 (A)
      `-5->  0.61538
          +-1->  0.30769 (B)
          `-1->  0.30769 (C)
         expected work    actual work       error    granularity
      A      588330445      588413071     0.00014        0.02600
      B      470664356      463468402    -0.01529        0.03250
      C      470664356      477777682     0.01511        0.03250
The command-line arguments mean "run 3 busy loops for 20 seconds, seed
the random number generator with 7".
A representation of the tree is given on top. Each line corresponds to
a node in the scheduling tree. The digit X in -X-> on each line is the
weight of the node. The fraction of CPU time this node expects to
receive is printed next. Leaf nodes are denoted by a letter in
brackets.
The expected and actual work columns are what they say. The error is
(actual - expected) / expected. The granularity is the maximum error
that can occur due to the discrete nature of scheduling - the maximum
timeslice for a process is 0.2 seconds, so the scheduler cannot divide
CPU time with bigger accuracy than this.
Best wishes,
Borislav
