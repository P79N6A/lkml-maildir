In Linux, currently, threads are processes.

In the POSIX spec fork demolishes all threads in the child. This is the
only sensible answer and it seems wasteful to ignore the rare sensible
parts of the POSIX spec. I think exec should do the same thing: calling
thread should die and be replaced by a thread/process that is not in the
thread group since it no longer shares memory.
