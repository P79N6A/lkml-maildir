I suspect the right answer here is to make nfs mount handling smarter.
The way mounting works the filesystem is allowed to choose whether it
can re-used a superblock or needs a new one.  In the NFS case we probably
want to allow multiple superblocks for the same export if important
paramaters like the security model mismatch.
This is however only the technical part of the answer.  There's a more
important one, and that's the user experience - we need a much better
way to document which flags are per-superblock and which are per-mount.
Due to this and some other issues we'll probably need a new mount API
in some time.
