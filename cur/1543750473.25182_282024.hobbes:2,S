I'm actually able to now re-create some problems with TF handling with a 
simple non-wine test, and I think I'm zeroing in on the reason for Wine 
breaking. And I think it just happened to work by luck before.
Not only do we have problems single-stepping over a system call, we _also_ 
have problems single-stepping over a "popf" - we'll set TF (to 
single-step), and then afterwards we'll _clear_ TF, even if the "popf" 
also was supposed to set it. 
Working on a patch for this right now, I'll send something out soonish 
(and I'll test it on my test-case before sending it, so that it at least 
has some chance of working).
