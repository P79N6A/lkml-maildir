  I was building a new kernel for a production mailserver.  I took the old
config from 2.4.18 and did a "make oldconfig" in the 2.4.21-ac3.  A
couple new values, compile, install reboot and reboot and reboot, etc.
  After a good bit of recompiling it seems that enabling the 64Gig
option instead of the 4Gig causes the machine to reboot after it counts
out it's procs.
  This machine only has 4Gigs of memory but is otherwise identicle to
the production server which has 16Gigs.
Thoughts?
