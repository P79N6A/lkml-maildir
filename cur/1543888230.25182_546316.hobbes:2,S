I don't think it is true.
When porting some summary stuff to bootloader, I hit some unaligned 
access problem :
in summary.c:405 there is a
switch (je16_to_cpu(((struct jffs2_sum_unknown_flash *)sp)->nodetype)) {
and
struct jffs2_sum_unknown_flash
{
     jint16_t nodetype;  /* node type */
};
note that sp isn't aligned to a 32 bits boundary (it can be anything and 
depend for example of the size of the dirent name).
if gcc doesn't emit code to handle unaligned loads in this case, there 
is unaligned access.
When compiling my code for arm, I use a gcc-4.1.1 with a bug and it 
break. With another compiler (last gcc from codesourcery) it worked 
(because gcc emit load it bit per bit).

Which version of gcc did you try ?
