I could go to 4K if I re-mkfs-ed my disks. But even with 4K blocks, my
patch still does difference.
Guys with 100G disks can not get more than 4K blocks -- so this is
still going to work for them.

Well - not at all.
I'm slowing down data operation by 5% or so. (Don't know how to
benchmark this).
I'm speeding up metadata operation by 100% or so.
You see? It does not seem that crazy now.
People _want_ to slow normal operation down in exchange for faster
fsck. (Did you hear that cries for journalling?) Journalling certainly
_will_ slow common operations down but makes fsck faster.
