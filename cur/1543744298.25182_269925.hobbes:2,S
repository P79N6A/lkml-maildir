I applied the patch to 2.6.10-rc1-mm4 and the application froze again, but i
just remembered that i changed a kernel-option in mm4 and forgot about that
yesterday:
I unset CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP and i suppose this could have this kind of effect
on high connection rates.
I set it back to CONFIG_PACKET_MMAP=y and if the application does not freeze
for some hours at this load we can blame at least this issue (-1 EAGAIN) on
that parameter.

 Experience is directly proportional to the amount of braincells ruined.
