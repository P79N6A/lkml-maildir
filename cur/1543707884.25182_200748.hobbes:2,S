Ah-HAH. This must be one of those fundamental differences between 
2.4 and 2.6. At the risk of sounding utterly incompetent, could 
you enlighten me as to what I should have been looking for in 
terms of seach terms. I like to think I'm a decent googler and I 
generally RTFM, but I was totally unable to help myself this 
time.
I was aware that the driver layer is completely different between 
the 2.4 and 2.6 series, but I have difficulty in finding out what 
that means from a practical standpoint. Hence the questions.
Thank you very much for your answer BTW. I play with it later this 
weekend.
