More suspicions on the diagnosis; the autofs/NFS seems to be 
involved, somehow... (This is consistent with Harri's mounting 19 
NFS2 disks, obviously).
So now it looks like some subset of 2.2.11 SMP, the rtl8139 driver 
and/or NFS/autofs.
The problem is also intermittent.  I ran stably for about 10 minutes 
before cd-ing to an (automounted) directory. That tickled the bug 
(which manifested itself as another huge count in rtl8139.c:1229 
under dosum). However, another time, it also manifested itself as a 
boot time hang when NFS was firing up.
Another thing is that buffer.c:986 seems to be getting hit (one 
instance 2528 times, another instance 93700 times) according to dosum.
