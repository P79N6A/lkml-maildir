It makes a whole lot of sense to combine a DLM with (appropriate)
fencing so that the shared resources are protected. I understood David's
comment to rather imply that fencing is assumed to happen outside the
DLM's world in a different component; ie more of a comment on sane
modularization instead of sane real-world configuration.
