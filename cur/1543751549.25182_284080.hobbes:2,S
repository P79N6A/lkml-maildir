Yes, but is there really some difference between people having to enable
LSM and add a new LSM module, and people recompiling the kernel to include
capabilities?
Also, is somebody really shipping 2.4 kernels without capabilities?
I'm unable to find any such config switch in 2.4.28 -- maybe it's because
I'm almost sleeping now, but it doesn't seem to be there.
				Have a nice fortnight
