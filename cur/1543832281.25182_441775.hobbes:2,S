You can either use suspend2 (14000 lines of unreviewed kernel code,
old) or uswsusp (~500 lines of reviewed kernel code, ~2000 lines of
unreviewed userspace code, new).
Of course, you can also use swsusp (~2000 lines of reviewed kernel
code, pretty old) if stability matters to you more than graphical
progress bar.
I know what I'm picking, and I'm pretty sure I know what
mainline/distros will pick.
If you want to help, you are welcome to test/review any component. But
stop producing hot air.
