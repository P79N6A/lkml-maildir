I just verified it. I and anybody else can mount and umount /cdrom. If
I mounted /cdrom, someone else can umount it.
$ mount -V
mount: mount-2.11n
$ grep user /etc/fstab
/dev/hdb/0 /cdrom iso9660 defaults,ro,unhide,user,noauto,noexec,nosuid 0 2
$ ls -l /etc/mtab 
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           12 2002-09-22 02:58 /etc/mtab -> /proc/mounts
When /etc/mtab is a regular file, it works as you described.
Regards, Olaf.
