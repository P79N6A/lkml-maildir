yep. The ptrace code has certainly lots of inconsistent style crap piled 
up during its 10 year history of only be touched with a 10 foot pole. 
I'd go for small patches that continuously improve the picture within 
the existing mechanisms than any "100% pure required" approach. With 48 
clean patches from Roland we are already on the right granularity level 
i think.
See how ptrace.c raw code quality has already increased leaps and 
bounds:
                                       errors   lines of code   errors/KLOC
 [before]
 arch/x86/kernel/ptrace_64.c               58             621          93.3
 arch/x86/kernel/ptrace_32.c               39             717          54.3
 [after]
 arch/x86/kernel/ptrace.c                  13            1135          11.4
so i'm not worried about that aspect. We are definitely "for the 
better".
