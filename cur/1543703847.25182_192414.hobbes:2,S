Not that many. You don't quite know in what state they are when
the BIOS calls you neither in most cases :) Nor when waking up
from BIOS-managed state.... It's usually safe if they just don't
bust master and are idle.

I will not impose that limitation on a ppc implementation. I don't
even want to load the resume image from the boot kernel, it's much more
easier to load it from the bootloader for me anyway. And the copy routine
is just a tricky bit of asm, not even _that_ tricky I'd say (well, I don't
do x86 asm, but I've certainly had to deal with more tricky stuffs on
ppc so far).
Ben.
