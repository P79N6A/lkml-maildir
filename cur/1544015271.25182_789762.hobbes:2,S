One thing to bear in mind is that if you're using a CPU which goes via swiotlb 
(such as a pre-nehalem Intel Quad) 2.6.24 won't be new enough. The r8169 
driver until recently had a grave bug on >=4GB RAM systems where the kernel 
would crash after some amount of transfer.
My advice to you is to install the very latest Debian kernel (2.6.27) in which 
this bug has been fixed. That said, I think if you do this, you won't have any 
further problems. Using the vendor driver instead of the one in mainline 
probably isn't a good idea.
