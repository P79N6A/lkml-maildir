Hi,
I'd tried to make my 2.4.4 kernel. But after I made the "make bzImage"
the following error arose:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/Usr/src/linux/2.2.4/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe
-march=i686 -c -o i387.o i387.c
{standard input}: Assambler messages:
{standard input}:30 Error: no such 386 instruction: `ldmxcsr'
make[1]: ***[i387.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.4/arch/i386/kernel'
make: ***[_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
I turn on and off the Math simulator. I also change the Processor From
AK6 to PentiumIII to Pentium to 386, nothing works!
I'm trying to install at my Toshiba Laptop AMD K6 3D, 400 Mhz. I turn on
the Toshiba option support.
I'm trying to install the 2.4.4 kernel mainly in order to support a USB
hard drive, as well to update my old 2.2.10
Any idea?
Regards
Hector Sanchez
