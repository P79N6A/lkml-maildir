I'd second that this is most likely a VM related problem. Last few days I
sent you an example that I would make system hang simply by
doing a mkfs on 90 GB file system. This happens when low 1GB memory is used
up (but I still have high 1GB available). I think
David probably ran into the same problem as I did.
I'd trace the problem down a bit. It seems that the system goes into a loop
that consists of the following call sequence:
     alloc_pages --> try_to_free_pages --> do_try_to_free_pages (but
doesn't seem to go through page_launder in do_try_to_free_pages) -->
kmem_cache_reap (so skipped the refill_inactive() in the if statement) -->
backto try_again in alloc_pages.
If I kill mkfs, the system would go on nicely for some small applications.
It is still a bit slow.
If I do a "make bzImage", the system would hang again. If I look at the
Sysrq output, I had more than 2000 pages available in inactive_clean list.
I wonder why
alloc_pages doesn't take it.
I had no problem with these kinds of things with test6 or test7.

Looking again at this report in more detail, something
very strange is going on ...

First, you have MORE free memory than freepages.high. In this
case I really don't see why __alloc_pages() wouldn't give the
memory to your processes ....

And there is tons of swap free...
Are you absolutely sure this is VM related?  This almost looks
like the system puts a in a read request but the request queue
doesn't get unplugged, or something strange like that ...
There is more than enough memory to satisfy all VM requests and
the loop in __alloc_pages() is straightforward enough to give
your processes their memory without strange bugs ...

Rik
