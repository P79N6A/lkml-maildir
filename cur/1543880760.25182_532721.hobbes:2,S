But for most of those apps, we don't actually care if they do fairly
degrade in performance as other loads on the system ramp up. However
the user prefers X to be given priority in these situations. Whether
that is the design of X, x clients, or the human condition really
doesn't matter two hoots to the scheduler.

Firstly, lots of clients in your list are remote. X usually isn't.
However for X, a syscall or something to donate time might not be
such a bad idea... but given a couple of X clients and a server
against a parallel make, this is probably just going to make the
clients slow down as well without giving enough priority to the
server.
X isn't special so much because it does work on behalf of others
(as you said, lots of things do that). It is special simply because
we _want_ rendering to have priority of the CPU (if you shifed CPU
intensive rendering to the clients, you'd most likely want to give
them priority to); nice, right?
