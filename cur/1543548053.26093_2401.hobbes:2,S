It isn't.  Try the following with/without the memory clobber:
int *p;
int func()
{
  int x;
  x = *p;
  __asm__ __volatile__ ("" : : : "memory");
  x = *p;
  return x;
}
With or without, the program reads *p only once.  However, with the
clobber it reads _after_ the asm; without, it reads _before_ the asm.
It's ok for the compiler to do that (given we don't know what "volatile"
means anyway :-).  But it does have implications for spin_lock:
spin_lock must say that it clobbers memory.
spin_unlock should also say it clobbers memory but I have no test case
to demonstrate the compiler moving reads down past an asm.
