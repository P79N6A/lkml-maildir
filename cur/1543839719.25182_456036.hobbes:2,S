It is tricky - currently there is RCU protection for storage list
traversal from each origin, i.e. the that path takes a lock when
kevent is really ready (to put it into ready list) and to check kevent's
flags (actually event that could be replced by more strict callback's 
return values).
No existing origins call kevent_storage_ready() from context where it
can be reentered (it guarantees from other side that locks will not be
reentered), so in theory that lockdep tricks are not needed right now
(they were added before I moved list traversal to RCU).
In the current code storage->lock is safe and correct from lockdep point 
of view (since different origins are never crossed), so I have not
changed reinit.
