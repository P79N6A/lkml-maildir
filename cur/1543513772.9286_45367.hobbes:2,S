Hi:
The biggest problem with splitting the driver into different versions
for different cards is probably going to be that the user will have to
try 15 drivers before he finds the right one.  Like Donald has said many
times, even chips that look alike aren't alike, and the same goes for
boards.  You can buy tulip clone boards from the same manufacturer a
month apart and find that they are different.  We've got probably 100
cards/boards with tulips on them, and Donald's newest driver has
_almost_ always worked better than or as well as the version that comes
with the kernel.  For Cardbus cards, this usually requires an update to
the latest pcmcia-cs version as well. If you split the drivers, does
anyone have a good idea how to automatically sense which driver will
work if there are multiple versions of tulip.c?  The job is even harder
when the chip is on the motherboard.  At least with a board, you can
look at the serial and model numbers...
