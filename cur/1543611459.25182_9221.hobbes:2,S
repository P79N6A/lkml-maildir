Mathematics has a rich tradition of using short variable names such as 
"pi" rather than something like "circle-circumference-to-diameter-ratio".
They keep formulas from becoming unreadably long, and have a meaning 
which is well understood in context.  While the long version may more
self-explainatory, it's the short form which is universally preferred.
