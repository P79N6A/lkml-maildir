I tested it on a 2GB EM64T machine, on PPC32, and i686.  I used the
latter for stress-tests with SBP-2, DV, and IIDC traffic on two buses
with 3 devices each, all active at once.
I had one lock-up during the stress-tests which I suspect is the
handle_at_packet panic, 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9617
which is unrelated to this patch.
I committed your patch to linux1394-2.6.git, whose shortlog and diff
from origin..for-linus looks now like this:

I'd like to submit this to Linus later today (Friday).  It all looks
like a bit too much for such a late -rc phase; but half of fw-ohci's
diffstat is actually just the added PMac code which has already proven
itself in ohci1394.
There are also some small new commits to linux1394-2.6.git master, whose
history is once again somewhat obfuscated by my pulling 'origin' and
'for-linus' into master, so that vice versa master can be cleanly pulled
into descendants of Linus' tree.
http://me.in-berlin.de/~s5r6/linux1394/updates/2.6.25-rc5/patches/series
gives a better picture of what is currently in the pipeline than git log
would give.
