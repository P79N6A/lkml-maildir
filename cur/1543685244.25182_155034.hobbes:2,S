I read the PCMCIA list, but not LKML, and I have no idea what problems you
are talking about.  Could you please explain of give a pointer to a
previous post?  I could cross-check the problem against plx9052 driver.
I'm sorry for asking you to spend some time and possibly repeat something
that was said before, but sometimes talking about the problem makes it
easier to understand it and find the best solution.

The same is done for TI and Ricoh bridges.  Just search the sources for
"socket->socket.ops->init".  You may have a good reason to be unhappy, but
coherent code is normally easier to fix than a bunch of different hacks.
