Well, the real problem seems to be in touching link power management policy
(it did not happen with ata_piix driver thus the driver seemed to be ok)
If I touch power management with theses commands:
echo max_performance > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy
echo medium_power > /sys/class/scsi_host/host0/link_power_management_policy
the suspend fails.
I always restore max_performance policy before the suspend.
