None of the other stuff is (a) a solution for any current problem I've
seen (it NEW capability), or (b) has a functional and widely exposed port
to 2.4 already.
The only other feature which which I'm familiar which even remotely fits
those two characteristics is rmap, and with the VM changes Andrea has made
I certainly don't hit really bad VM behaviour on my machines. On some rmap
is a tad better, but compared to 2.4.16 or so 19-preX-aa is acceptable.

The current scheduler has one big bug; it gives the processor to the wrong
process under some load conditions to the point where the system appears
hung for seconds (or longer). There are two issues, one is best or
acceptable performance, and one is "best worst-case performance." The O(1)
simply doesn't have or hasn't shown me the jackpot case when load changes
on a machine. To me that justifies O(1). Even if it was not faster than
the current scheduler for normal load, the worst case is what needs a fix.
And as I mentioned to Ingo, I don't feel that way about low-latency or
preempt, even though they help a little they don't really fix anything
broken, and I don't argue for inclusion. The current scheduler does behave
very badly in some cases, and should be fixed now, not in 18 months.
