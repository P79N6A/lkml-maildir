NACK on this one.  This bloats romfs by almost half of it's previous
size to add mtd support to it.  Given that romfs is a compltely
trivial filesystem it's much better to have a separate filesystem
driver handling the format on mtd instead of adding all these
indirections.  In addition to that argument the switch on the
underlying subsystem is done horrible.  There's lots of ifdefs instead
of proper functions pointers, there's one file containing both block
and mtd code instead of seaparate files, etc.
And the get_unmapped_area method in a bare filesystem needs a _lot_
of explanation.
