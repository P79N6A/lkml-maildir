All reports I've seen mention that the driver works fine if compiled as a
module. You may
want to try that. For this reason I also don't believe the problem is the
any of the emu10k1
source files (which you diff'ed), unfortunately I haven't had much
time/means to test this
since I'm without a home PC and a SBLive.

Alan/Rui,
just built 2.2.18 (on a box that's been running 2.2.14 for a very very long
time, and loading an emu10k1 module from opensource.creative.com or
wherever).
was pleased to note that emu10k1 finally made it in. Compiled and built.
Dmesg
indicated that things were detecting nicely, but attempts to play sound
result
in 'Cannot open /dev/dsp!' (not a rights problem). I had heard a bit
earlier
this evening on #debian that someone was complaining of similar problems on
a
2.2.17->2.2.18 upgrade, so on a hunch i pulled down a 2.2.17 kernel, and
make
oldconfig'd it with my 2.2.18 config.
dmesg again fine, this time it works :) so there does appear to be a
problem
there.
templestowe:~$ dmesg |less
Linux version 2.2.17 (root@templestowe) (gcc version 2.95.2 20000220

Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.6, 01:45:48 Dec 19 2000
emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 4 model 0x20 found, IO at 0xe400-0xe41f, IRQ 10
...
machine is running debian sid. i'll be happy to do anything else anyone
suggests to play with this. I did diff out the source file by file in
drivers/sound/emu10k1 (my *god* since when did this driver need to be 8k+
lines
of code? i just wrote a kernel and filesystem for my CMU OS class [15-412]
in
that many lines :)  ... and there's more than i'm prepared to deal with.
is this driver working for anyone else in 2.2.18? anyone recall the
reasoning
behind this patch set (i may well have missed it going by on l-k)?
perhaps this is just a known problem by now but i haven't seen mention on
l-k
so i'll risk the wrath of the appropriate gods.
Cheers,
Ari Heitner
