Please notice that my problem has nothing to do with text mode
restoration; the "clicking" or "jitter" in the sound was audible while
stressing the computer (even slightly -- changing Window Maker workspaces
or text scrolling in an Eterm). There was zero problems changing between
ordinary text consoles and the one XF86_SVGA was running on.

Neither did I have problems -- until recently. I'm in the process of
learning how XFree (the svga server) and matroxfb work, but it will
probably take a lot of time before I can contribute to fixing whichever is
broken.
