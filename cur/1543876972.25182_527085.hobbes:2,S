That's exactly what mine does (except IIRC it doesn't invalidate when
you add a vma).

The mmap_sem for read does not only protect the mm_rb rbtree structure, but
the vmas themselves as well as their page tables, so you can't do that.
You could do it if you had a lock-per-vma to synchronise against write
operations, and rcu-freed vmas or some such... but I don't think we should
go down a road like that until we first remove mmap_sem from low hanging
things (like private futexes!) and then see who's complaining.
