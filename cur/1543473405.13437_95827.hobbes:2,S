	Yes, of course. In my Unicode font map I substitute english
letter with diacritic symbols by the same, but without diacritics (ASCII)
just because I have cyrillyc letters instead of diacritic latin, greek, etc.

	I agree, but I use single way that exist in console driver now
for converting Unicode symbols to user codeset. Another way - add to
console driver unsigned short unicode2codeset[3][65535] table. Only this
complete table allow make conversion from Unicode to codeset always right.
But imho 256kb of traslating table its too big for kernel driver. Any other
methods can't be right in any circumstances.

	Imho selection used screen glyphs now just because there is not
correct Unicode to codeset translating in kernel. If it will be invented
(in 2.3 may be ?) it will be very usefull both for keyboard & for selection.
Have you any ideas how make such translation without eating a lot of memory ?
