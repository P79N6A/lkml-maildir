hello,
	Is there reason why I can't set pointopoint for ethernet? I have
	to computers (and two 100mbps ethernet cards) connected via  null-modem
	ethernet cable (with no hub in between).  So since there's no way
	to have more than two hosts talking to each other for all intended
	purposes it IS a pointopoint link.
	looking at net/core/dev.c:dev_change_flags() I see
	that I can't pass IFF_POINTOPOINT to it via ioctl, and
	it will be just sillently dropped, with no error reported
	back to ifconfig.
