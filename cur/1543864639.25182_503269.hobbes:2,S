If you really want to get people up to speed on a topic, then you need
a bibliography - which in practice may just be a few links to articles on
the h/w involved, research papers on the s/w techniques, or just to
previous mailing list discussions (especially if these were on a
special topic list rather then on LKML).  That would give people whose
interest is piqued by the abstract a starting point to learn a bit
more before the summit so there can be an informed discussion.
