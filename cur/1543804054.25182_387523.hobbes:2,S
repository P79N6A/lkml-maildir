I looked into the number of struct inode on slab of x86
in cases i_blocks is both 4 bytes and 8 bytes.
As the following tables, the number of inodes per slab is the same
in both cases.  So at least on x86, there seems to be no influence for
the memory usage by extending inode->i_blocks.
In default configuration (CONFIG_QUOTA=ON, CONFIG_INOTIFY=ON):
-------------------------------------------------------------
In case inode->i_blocks is unsigned long
                size of inode(byte)     the number per slab
ext2_inode_info        588                       6
ext3_inode_info        612                       6
In case inode->i_blocks is unsigned long long
                size of inode(byte)    the number per slab
ext2_inode_info        592                       6
ext3_inode_info        616                       6
--------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIG_QUOTA=OFF, CONFIG_INOTIFY=OFF:
-------------------------------------------------------------
In case inode->i_blocks is unsigned long
                size of inode(byte)    the number per slab
ext2_inode_info             540                  7
ext3_inode_info             564                  7
In case inode->i_blocks is unsigned long long
                size of inode(byte)    the number per slab
ext2_inode_info             544                  7
ext3_inode_info             568                  7

I added CONFIG_LSF to use large filesystem over network with >2TB file
even on a small system as CONFIG_LBD disable.  And I heard that some
people dislike network filesystems depending on block device.
Trond, do you have comments about integrating CONFIG_LFS and
CONFIG_LBD?
