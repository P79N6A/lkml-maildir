   I've been reading the code in arch/i386/kernel/time.c and I think I
   see a what should be a bug in do_fast_gettimeoffset(), but I can
   not trigger it.  So I wonder what I'm missing...
Interrupts are disabled and the SMP xtime_lock is held, so as
far as I can tell the sequence of events which would trigger the
bug cannot occur.
Later,
