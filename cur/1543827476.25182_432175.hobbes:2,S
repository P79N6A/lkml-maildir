It's probably a good idea to move the bulk of the patches to the patches list. 
This will probably increase the attractiveness of the discuss list.
Regarding the testing, I'm trying to find one or two people who can help you 
with this. We have an interest to keep the -mm submissions in good shape. 
Just give me a few more weeks.
Chris
