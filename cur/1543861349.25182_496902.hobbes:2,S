Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] remove the broken SCSI_ACORNSCSI_3 driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/6/140

The SCSI_ACORNSCSI_3 driver:
- has been marked as BROKEN for more than one year and
- is still marked as BROKEN.
Drivers that had been marked as BROKEN for such a long time seem to be
unlikely to be revived in the forseeable future.
But if anyone wants to ever revive this driver, the code is still
present in the older kernel releases.
