Considering the several FPGA models available and ways to program it,
I guess the important thing to consider is what can be made generic.
(that is what will become fpgaload)
Also, there may be cases where after FPGA is programmed it "becomes a
device" (PCI or whatever)

I think this maybe split into three layers (maybe)
1 - low level connection: paralell / spi / i2c / whatever
2 - vendor: xylinx, altera, etc
3 - generic stuff
Take a look at the MTD and SPI drivers and how they split things
