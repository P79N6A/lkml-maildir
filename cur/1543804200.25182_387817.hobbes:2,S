Things like net/sunrpc/xprtsock.c:xs_bindresvport() will bind,
but to a specific port.  It leaves the address field all zeros
which makes the kernel pick a default.
net/sunrpc/svcsock.c does something similar, you can get it
to use a particular port but it uses INADDR_ANY for the
address during the bind().
