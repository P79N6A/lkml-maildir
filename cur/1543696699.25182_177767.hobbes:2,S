It's not x86-specific stuff, it's literally specific to the ISA bridge. 
And I'm pretty sure this horrid test was there at least partly for a 
Transmeta setup that had a non-ALI northbridge together with an ALI 
southbridge. The fact that it _also_ triggers on other machines may well 
be true, though.
