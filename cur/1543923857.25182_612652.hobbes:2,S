FWIW, I could have used a "swap to network technology X" like system at
my last job.  We were building a large networking switch with blades,
and the IO cards didn't have anywhere near the resources that the
control modules had (no persistent storage, small ram, etc).  We were
already doing userspace coredumps over NFS to the control cards.  It
would have been nice to swap as well.
