Nice!
Testing on ICH5 (P4HT) hasn't shown any problems so far.

Same here, the ICH4 trace is nowhere to be found.
Should I do a public request for chipset testing?
(I wrote a small test app here that would hopefully identify a buggy
chipset).
Data that I have collected from internet snippets (mostly Intel errata
documents):
Affected (PCI ID / rev):
  - ICH4???
  - PIIX4 A0 (0x7113 / 00?), A1 (0x7113 / 00?), B0 (0x7113 / 01?)
  - PIIX4E A0 (0x7113 / 02?)
Probably fixed (PCI ID / rev):
  - PIIX4M A0 (0x7113 / 03?)
My Toshiba Satellite 4280 seems to have non-buggy PIIX4M
(since it's PCI rev. 03), haven't had time to test reliability yet, though.

Good, that's how it should be done as long as it's not entirely known which
chipsets (both Intel and possibly also non-Intel!) are buggy.
Also, I think that since triple-reading wastes 3% of system time, it would
be very nice to be able to eventually write a software workaround for buggy
systems, too.
This could perhaps be done by keeping the *old* value in a global yet
thread-safe variable and checking whether the new value is safely related
to it if within short jiffies distance (but since jiffies are probably
calculated from pmtmr readings... :-P).
