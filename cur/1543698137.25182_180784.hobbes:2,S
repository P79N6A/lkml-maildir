so definitely, 32 MB/s is almost half the speed that you get. I'm in 
2.6-test11. I don't know more options to try. The next will be booting 
with "noapic nolapic". Some people reported better results with this.
by the way, I have booted with "doataraid noraid" (no drives connected, 
only SATA support in bios), and nothing is shown in the boot messages 
(nor dmesg) about libata being loaded. I don't know if I must connect a 
hard drive and then the driver shows up, but I don't think that.
Thanks!
