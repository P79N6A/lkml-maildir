Yeap, I'm getting this too. There seems to be a whole bunch of changes 
in include/asm-ppc64/pgtable.h that aren't in include/asm-ppc/pgtable.h
This is at least my guess.
By doing the dumb cut&paste business I've gotten further along, but 
haven't done enough to actually compile fully yet. I'm half nervous 
about doing a lot of this as I have no idea about this level on ppc 
(maybe benh, the maintainer of linux for power mac could help out?).
If I get anything going, I'll let you know.
on an architectural question, there seems to be a lot of duplication 
between ppc and ppc64, should they be more closely melded or is there a 
really-good-reason(tm) behind the seperation?
