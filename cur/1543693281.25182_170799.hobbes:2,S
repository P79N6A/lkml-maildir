If no support for floppy drives is compiled in to the kernel, it's
reasonable to expect no floppy-related accesses to be done to those
ports.

OK, so the bootloader is at fault, not the BIOS.  If the BIOS is
configured to allow booting from floppy, but you decide to boot from
other media on any occasion, the first code loaded, I.E. the
bootloader, should turn off the floppy motor.

If the floppy motor ends up being on all the time, how is that a

Yes, it is, the real solution is to fix the bootloader.  I was simply

I consider it just as much of a hack to add floppy-related code to all
i386 kernels whether they are for floppy-less machines or not.
