Hi,
As I'm sure the drivers/net maintainers are well aware, SysKonnect constantly 
update their sk98lin/sky2 driver without bothering to sync their changes with 
the official linux kernel.
I quickly downloaded driver version 8.31 from 
http://www.skd.de/
 today and 
used the install script to generate a diff against 2.6.16-rc3. Even after 
fixing up some DOS EOLs in the package, the diff was still well over 1.5MBs. 
This is an enormous number of changes.
The reason I'm posting is that my DFI LanParty-UT SLI-D works with this 
version of the driver, but not the version 2.6.16-rc3.
[alistair] 10:55 [~] dmesg | grep sk98lin
sk98lin: Could not read VPD data.
sk98lin: probe of 0000:01:0a.0 failed with error -5
I wonder if it's worth just identifying the "quick fix" (I've seen workarounds 
for corrupt VPDs like mine) or whether a general merge up would be 
beneficial..
If nobody's maintaining this driver I wouldn't mind helping out.

Alistair.
