    I'd jump in here at a better point in the thread, but I'm at work right now and this is the only message I can reply to atm...
    I personally have the following problem. I have two mice, one a MS PS/2 Intellimouse. the second, a Logitech optomechanical cordless mouse (and keyboard too) attached via USB (both mouse and keyboard use same receiver as well as USB connection)
    The PS/2 mouse, which requires me to either have the driver built-in, or to manually modprobe, works more or less fine, in both X and console (using GPM). But, my USB mouse, which works fine in X, screws up in console mode. I'm using GPM's repeater function for X.
    Basically what happens is that the USB mouse can move around, but I can't use the buttons. It echoes some of the control codes to my console, and hence makes it useless for cutting and pasting.
    Admittedly, I could just hook up the mouse and keyboard to the PS/2 ports using some adapters, bypassing the USB. and it would probably work. But, why? Why is this broken in 2.6, but not in 2.4?

    I agree here. Admittedly GPM isn't perfect, and should perhaps be rewritten, but it belongs in userspace.

Because khttpd wasn't that useful, was a bit ugly. Also Tux superseded it. And last of all, most of the stuff that Tux patched to make things faster... were merged into mainline and made available to userspace. So that Apache could do most/all of what Tux could, in userspace, w/ little overhead/cost.
