Embarrassing, huh?  But I just found a bug in my code cause by
"if (strcmp(a,b))" instead of "if (!strcmp(a,b))".
This bites me about once a year, so Linus, please apply.
Preparing to have my "3l33t k3rN31 h@ck3r" card revoked,
Rusty.
Name: streq implementation
Author: Rusty Russell
Status: Trivial
D: I can't believe that after all these years I still make the "sense
D: of strcmp" mistake.  So it's time to reintroduce my favorite macro.
