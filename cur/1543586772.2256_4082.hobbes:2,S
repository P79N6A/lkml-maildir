	How arbitrary is the divisor ?
	Not by change a power-of-two ?
	If it is arbitrary, how large ?
	The printk() contains support routine doing  longlong/int
	division when a) speed is *not* important, b) divisor is
	sufficiently small, and I think c) divisor is positive.
	When you look at that code, you should begin to grasp,
	what kind of monster is the longlong/longlong code at -lgcc ...
	(and why gcc doesn't produce inline code for it.)
