Hi,
Don't know if its already reported earlier, 2.6.17-git13 doesn't seem to 
compile
with CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG. I get "undefined symbol" problem
at kernel/resource.c line: 243
It looks like "resource_size_t" is not defined anywhere. (it should be 
defined
in linux/types.h according to patches sent out by Gregkh). May be 
missing a patch ?
Thanks,
Badari
