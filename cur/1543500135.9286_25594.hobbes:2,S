    I think you're going to have to enumerate some of the cases
    where ``everything is a file'' broke down, and then you're
    going to need to enumerate some of the reasons why ``everything
    is a message'' is not exactly the same as ``everything is a
    file'' (aside from ``message'' being spelled differently
    than ``file'', which most people have already figured out.)
