Hardware Discovery using
	PnpBIOS
	ISAPnP
	MCA
	PCI
	ACPI
IRQ Routing using
	PCI BIOS
	$PIR
	MP 1.x
	ACPI
Power Management using
	CPU idling instructions
	APM
	Direct power management
	ACPI
There are all sorts of combinations that make sense, and trying to make
them all map around ACPI makes no sense, especially once you hit non x86
platforms where the mentality is quite different about what is
associated
