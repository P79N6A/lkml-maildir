Ehm, right.
Running netscape (or any other memory hog which doesn't belong on a server)
on a production server seems reason enough for a little talk with your boss.
On the other hand, if no other apps are running on your box, and Oracle gets
killed due to OOM, you probably have underestimated your hardware needs, or
Oracle has gone haywire, which is a good reason for killing it.
Thus, nothing seems wrong with the current kill algorithm to me...
Just my two cents,
