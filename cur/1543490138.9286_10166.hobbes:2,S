In other words, glibc 2.1 is broken. 
Guys, most people use libc5 or glibc 2.0.x if they've installed from a
distribution. I'm running Redhat 5.0, which uses glibc 2.0.5, so if Star
Office installs a newer glibc, no big deal. It's when people are at the
leading edge that these kind of bugs "byte" them.
