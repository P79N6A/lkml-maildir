Looks sane.

Not sure what you mean by "on uniprocessor"?  AFAICT the patch will work
as-is on uniprocessor and on SMP.  Looks like it'll work with
CONFIG_PREEMPT=n, too, although that would be a slightly bizarre thing to
do.

I'll change this to
				print_symbol("%s",
					__get_cpu_var(preempt_exit));
				printk("\n");
so it doesn't make a mess with CONFIG_KALLSYMS=n.
