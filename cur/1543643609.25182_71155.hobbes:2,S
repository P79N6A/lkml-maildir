It would be nice to be able to add a short string to the kernel version
for identification, to differentiate between runs with the same kernel and
different tuning.
I've found that tuning often helps response, like reducing memory with
older rmap versions (ran for a while using mem=256m), or tuning bdflush
with -aa kernels, which I did after Andrea gave me some serious hints.
Just a short string added to the version would make this a bit easier to
follow after the fact.
