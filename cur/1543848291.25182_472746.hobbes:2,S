For the io submitter and above layers, it's 100% identical to doing it
at end_that_request_first() time (which I suspect is what you meant). So
the above tests those layers only, which is fine if that is what you
want. When we have timeout timers at the block layer (moved from lower
layers), we could do more fancy stuff and test lower layers of the io
stack as well more easily.
