i was trying to come up with a userland-only change in mount(8) which
would behave like so:
# mount --subtree var /dev/md1 /var
  internally mount does:
  - mount /dev/md1 /tmpmnt
  - mount --bind /tmpmnt/var /var
  - umount /tmpmnt
# mount --subtree home /dev/md1 /home
  internally mount does:
  - mount /dev/md1 /tmpmnt
  - mount --bind /tmpmnt/home /home
  - umount /tmpmnt
but that second mount would fail because /dev/md1 is already mounted
(but the mount point is gone)...
it certainly works if i issue the commands individually as i described
-- but a change within mount(8) would have the benefit of working with
/etc/fstab too.
