So having you see the information to set up your udev is a good use and 
having Joerg use them is bad? If you want to have names mapped into 
"humanspace" why is program use bad? I agree numbers are ugly and 
confusing, but if I wanted someone to make those choices for me I'd run 
another o/s.
The "support is accidental" message pisses me off, because it isn't 
true. Code was added, I'm betting by design.

Which is fine if you have a system to dedicate to burning CDs. But on a 
loaded system Joerg is right, you get a better burn if you don't have 
the burnfree used. Like any other minor defect it may or may not bite 
you, a lot of them will measurably reduce your CD capacity, which 
actually will bite you if you are trying to use every last byte.

See above. It hasn't bitten you, therefore it doesn't bite... it's 
generally safe on a fast unloaded system.

Possibly true, didn't work for me.

No argument with that.

There is an option if you would read the manpage. There are legitimate 
complaints, this doesn't seem to be one of them.
