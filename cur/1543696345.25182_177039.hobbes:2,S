Tried it with minimal config. Base problem is, that after suspending,
I've no way to wake up the laptop again, but power cycling.
That means:
~  "mem": after power cycling it is doing a 'normal' reboot. (okay memory
contents is lost, so this is somewhat expected)
~  "disk": hey, after power cycling it indeed resumes to the previous
state. so I tried to compile in some more stuff. What breaks it is AGP
support :-(. Are there any patches around which may fix this?
Any idea, why the laptop is not powering on again after suspend? I can
hold down the power switch as long as I want to, but the laptop doesn't
do a thing.
Thanks,
Jan
