I was thinking that myself (PCI activity triggering this).
The first time I hit this problem was with a card with two
ACENics/tigon2 (acenic.o) sniffing traffic at high rates
(100,000pps+) with most file i/o going over NFS on the
integrated 3com interface.
I ran for three days 200,000+pps sniffing with tethereal on
windows2000 on both acenics and never a lockup.
The AMD-Nvidia PATA does seem to be a very common in this
problem, but everyone at least has a CD-ROM and most
have a PATA hard disk so its going to be there every time
a problems crops up. I think we need to prove that an
solid add-in PCI PATA card that takes the CD and the
and the PATA disk and shut off the onboard ATA and torture
test again. I havent had time to yet.
