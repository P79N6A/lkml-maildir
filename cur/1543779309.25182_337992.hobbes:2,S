Subject: [PATCH 2.6] (3/11) hwmon vs i2c, second round
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/31/154

We now have two identical structures, i2c_address_data in i2c-sensor.h
and i2c_client_address_data in i2c.h. We can kill one of them, I choose
to keep the one in i2c.h as it makes more sense (this structure is not
specific to sensors.)

-     A list of I2C addresses which should normally be examined.
-   probe: insmod parameter. Initialize this list with I2C_CLIENT_END values.
-     A list of pairs. The first value is a bus number (ANY_I2C_BUS for any
-     I2C bus), the second is the address. These addresses are also probed,
-     as if they were in the 'normal' list.
-   ignore: insmod parameter. Initialize this list with I2C_CLIENT_END values.
-     A list of pairs. The first value is a bus number (ANY_I2C_BUS for any
-     I2C bus), the second is the I2C address. These addresses are never
-     probed. This parameter overrules 'normal' and  probe', but not the
-    'force' lists.
-   forces: insmod parameters. A list, ending with a NULL element.
-     Force variables overrule all other variables; they force a detection on
-     that place. If a specific chip is given, the module blindly assumes this
-     chip type is present; if a general force (kind == 0) is given, the module
-     will still try to figure out what type of chip is present. This is useful
-     if for some reasons the detect for SMBus address space filled fails.
