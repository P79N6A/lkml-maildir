BTW: If you are sending me anything DO use attachments. Especially if you
use any of the following, which seem to have some versions that mangle 
inline diffs
	Lotus Notes
	Pine
	Kmail
	Mozilla
	Netscape
	MS Outlook
If you aren't sure if your mailer is ok then send yourself a block of text
that contains a line over 80 chars long, a line ending in space, and a line
with tabs in it
Check the tabs are still there, the space on the end of the line hasnt been
eaten (eg pine) and that the long line was not wrapped.
