LOL? I don't understand...
I don't see how any of those cases are necessarily hard to visualize. 
Case 1: Typical PC with IDE as function of southbridge.
pci0
 |
  -- 07.2 (IDE controller)
     |
      --- disk0
     |
      --- disk1
Case 2: Promise IDE Controller with 2 channels
pci0
 |
  --- 03.0 (Promise IDE Controller)
      |
       --- channel0
           |
            ---- disk0
           |
            ---- disk1
Case 3: Quad channel DEC Bridge
Ok, maybe I don't understand completely what you're talking about, Andre. 
That's just a 4 channel IDE controller, that happens to be on the board? 
So, it's looks the same as the last example.
Unless, I'm missing something, which is always likely.
