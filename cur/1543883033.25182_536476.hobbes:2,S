I _think_ what it is doing is actually flushing dcache lines dirtied
via the kernel virtual address (yes, I think flush_icache in
lazy_mmu_prot_update is actually just flushing the dcache, but I could
be wrong? [*]). There are supposedly no icache lines at that point[**]:
the bug fix at the start of this thread is due to icache lines
becoming present before the flush.
[*] and if I'm right, that means that icache fills don't see dirty
dcache, but rather always load from memory? I hope someone can
answer these questions?
[**] except due to _existing_ executable mappings, of course, but they
seem to have been comprehensively disregarded...
