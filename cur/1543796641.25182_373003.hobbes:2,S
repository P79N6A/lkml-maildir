I tend to disagree a bit here.  If it can be separate without making the
API more complicated a separate module is nicer, if the API would get nasty
integerating it is better.  And nevermind whether it's a separate module or
not it should live in net/ieee80211/ ;-)
In either case ?I think this decision is better left until the code is in
an almost mergeable shape, because then the details will be clear.
