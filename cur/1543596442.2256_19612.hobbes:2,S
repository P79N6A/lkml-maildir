Sorry, haven't looked at that yet.
ext3 journals data.  That's unique and it breaks things (or rather,
things break it).   It'd be trivial to support O_DIRECT in ext3's
writeback mode (metadata-only), but nobody uses that.
From a quick look it seems that we'll need fs-private implementations
of generic_direct_IO() and brw_kiovec() at least.
I'll take a closer look.
