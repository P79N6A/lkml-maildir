But Paul, if you keep removing all these examples of memory barriers,
how can I be expected to learn how to use them properly?
Seriously, good, yes, the fewer "mb"s the better.
I could always educate myself from the older source.

Agreed ;)

Wouldn't it be a little nicer to start ipc_ids off pointing to a
const ipc_id_ary of size 0, to avoid the various entries == NULL
tests you had to add?
