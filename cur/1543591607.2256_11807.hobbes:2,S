If I understand the status of stuff correctly, I think this would make it
a lot more painful to admin if it became a requirement to use initrd on
everything just to be able to boot. If you've ever seen the way some of
the bootloaders for alterate platforms (like ppc and 68k) handle booting,
you'd see what a pain it can be to have anything more than a simple string
of options getting passed to the kernel. It's particularly bad on some
of the embedded ppc platforms. I suspect that if this happened, it would
never be allowed into many people's trees, because it would be worth their
effort to maintain different code so they don't have to squeeze an initrd
on flash along with their kernel and root filesystem. If I'm missing the
boat here, please tell me, but it sure seems like a bad idea to me.
