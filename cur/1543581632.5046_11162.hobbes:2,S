Ah, but it does matter !  We break compatibility with other systems (and
our manpages, and possibly standards) if we don't mark the segment
IPC_PRIVATE upon removal -
Marking the segment IPC_PRIVATE allows its continued use by those alread
connected to the segment (until the count drops to zero, and its
deleted), but *prevents* new users from attaching to the segment.
I started down this road because we weren't marking the segment, was
delighted to see it done in pre3 - but it seemed like the setting
wasn't always done ;-{
