Someone building a new kernel for a box (ie administrator) will have
root priveledges. Though running 'make guessconfig' or whatever as
root would suck.
What Alan suggests (ripping the necessary bits out of dmidecode
and making a setuid program) sounds better, as long as someone
audits it afterwards.

probing isa isn't pretty. which is why we don't have anything
as nice as /proc/bus/pci. The pnpbios support goes a little towards
this, but only detects PNP cards obviously. Ye olde ISA is all but
invisible to /proc
As we get the devicefs in 2.5 fleshed out, hopefully such things will
come in time for the older busses like PNPISA & EISA

Just because its a shitbucket, doesn't mean we should keep adding to it.
It's become the dumping ground for so much crap that just doesn't need to
be there.
