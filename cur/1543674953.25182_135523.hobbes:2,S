no...  What we need to do is to kill the printk in handle_IRQ_event().
It should only be turned on for special situations, where someone is trying
to hunt down a reproducible lockup.  These are situations in which the odd
false positive just doesn't matter.  And we know that there will always
be false positives due to apic delivery latency (at least).
I think the time is right to do this.  Add CONFIG_DEBUG_IRQ and get on with
fixing real stuff.
