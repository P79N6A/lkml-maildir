 hi,
This is strange. I just downloaded 2.3.26 and 2.3.25. untar;
make mrproper; make xconfig; make dep
now, I do make bzImage and get this error:
---------------------
>pwd
/usr/src/linux.2.3.26
>make bzImage
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-include scripts/split-include.c
In file included from /usr/include/errno.h:36,
                 from scripts/split-include.c:26:
/usr/include/bits/errno.h:25: linux/errno.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [scripts/split-include] Error 1
-------------------------
The same exact error with 2.3.25. (did make clean also, no help)
with 2.3.24 source tree I do the same steps, and no 
problem. it compile fine.
>gcc --version
egcs-2.91.66
>uname -a
Linux suse 2.3.24 #2 Thu Oct 28 19:39:22 PDT 1999 i686 unknown

the problem is that the -I does not even show include/linux in 
the path. 
I see alot of changes in the Makefile for the directory
/usr/src/linux.2.3.26/scripts.
Any one else got this problem trying to compile these 2 kernels?
regards,
Nasser
