So, what do you plan to do? Those handle won't be zero-based. Your 
"working" system I immagine will do:
	bleeh[handle - BASE].duh = ...;
How nice for a working system. If you *store* the handle returned by the 
OS, and you *use* the handle to call for OS services, you will be fine 
independently from the value handed out by the OS.
