I have a tool which compresses individual files in a tar archive
instead of the whole archive[1]. That one tries hard to write only in
standard 10kb blocks to emulate tar's behavior towards the drive.
I'll try in a few days (when I'm back from holidays) if I have this
error on my scsi tape too (bad) and if the compression program affects
it.
