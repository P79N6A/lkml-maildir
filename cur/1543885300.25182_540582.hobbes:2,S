Ah. Thanks, that clarifies things.
Jiri: please test the patch below instead. That is, revert to
the original code _with_ the 'return 1;', and then add this
patch to it. It should have pretty much the same effect as
removing the 'return 1;', however calling ata_port_abort()
is more in line with libata's new-style error handling.
