NO!  Please, don't do this again (for now, at least).
This idea is what we had introduced the bug,
that was fixed by "[IPV6]: Fixed multiple mistake extension header handling."
We need to get the offset of the next header, in addition to the value
itself.
inet6_protocol function will return:
  > 0: more header(s) follows; next header is pointed by skb->nh.raw[nhoff]
  = 0: stop parsing on success; increment the statistics (nhoff is undefined)
  < 0: stop parsing on failure (nhoff is undefined)
If upper-layer returns positive value, we continue parsing.
Then, if the skb->nh.raw[nhoff] is unknown, we send back the parameter problem 
message with the offset to the unrecognized next header field.
> The less that is different between ipv4/ipv6 the better.
Agreed, but please note that IPv4 side would be required to be changed
in general.
Well... 
1) May we have a new member to point the offset of the next header in 
   ipv6_pinfo{}?
   Then, we can remove *nhoffp from argument of inet6_protocol function.
   (We will be cleaner handing of HbH option, too.)
2) change IPv4 upperlayer function to take struct sk_buff **.
If you are not in hurry, I'll take care of this.
