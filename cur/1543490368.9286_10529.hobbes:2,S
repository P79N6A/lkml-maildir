Hi,
	I'm back to using a no name 486 motherboard with an AMD586 chip.
Before this week, I was using a Via based Matsonic K6 motherboard. Both
motherboards have PS/2 mouse support built in.
I have both 2.2.3 and 2.0.36 kernels installed on this machine. When
booting with 2.0.36, the built-in PS/2 mouse port works on both
motherboards, but with 2.2.3, only the K6 motherboard's PS/2 port works.
Has anyone else experienced this problem?
Please CC all replies to me.
Thanks,
Chris
