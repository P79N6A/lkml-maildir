I probably should have said non-primary, but the issue is the the pdc now
may be identified before the built-in IDE, such as VIA. If Linux doesn't
identify hda as the same drive as the BIOS, interesting boot problems
occur. And if 2.4.18 did one thing and 2.4.19 did another it gets even
more likely to confuse the user.
I think the real issue is if we should change the order of detection in a
stable kernel series, and I'll just sit and watch the sparks, there seem
to be strong feelings both ways.
