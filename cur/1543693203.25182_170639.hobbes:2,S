Ok, I tried 2.4.19, which I thought was pretty bad because it randomly 
crashed all the time, and it worked just fine with all my drives.  
2.4.20 with the wolk-4.0 patch also worked.  So, I'm guessing it was 
between 2.4.20 and 2.4.21....I could try all the prepatches as well, 
and narrow down exact prepatch, will take some time.  dmesg output for 
2.4.21 follows (uses a patchset for XFS, sensors, etc), along with my 
config, both compressed.
