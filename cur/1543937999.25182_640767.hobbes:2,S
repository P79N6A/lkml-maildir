Dear Arnaldo, I didnt see your mail before.
I read some of the code you suggested, but it seems so complicated! I
just need to create a file named "file" on the path /tmp/.. Isn't
there an easier way?
Or else, where can I find some more information about what the parameters mean?
(struct svc_rqst *rqstp, struct nfsd3_createargs *argp, struct
nfsd3_diropres   *resp)
It seems that with the "argp" parameter, I could pass all my
information, but I dont see what to put on the other parameters...
I would greatfuly thank some link where to find some information, please.
greetings,
Rafael Sisto.
