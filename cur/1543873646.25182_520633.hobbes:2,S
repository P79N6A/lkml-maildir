Valid question.  I should have chosen some other more appropriate
patch to make that comment.
I don't see a better list for UBI patches, so lkml is OK IMO.
Here is a summary of my thinking on Linux-related mailing lists.
1.  Bug reports can go to lkml or focused mailing lists.
2.  Development (like patches) should go to focused mailing lists
if there is such a list and they have enough usage.
Development areas that qualify for this IMO are:
- ACPI
- ATA
- file systems
- frame buffer
- ieee1394
- MM/VM
- multimedia
- networking
- PCI
- power management, suspend/resume
- SCSI
- sound
- USB
- virtualization
(not that I expect anything close to concensus on this)
