You say you are using Postgres, right?  Something you might try to see
if it triggers the problem it is creating a new database and then
restoring some database dump/backup into that new database.  Some
databases expand into a new table space (or whatever terminology
Postgres uses) by random writes into a sparse portion of the file.
This could be triggering the problem, or at least trigger the problem
more quickly.
The other thing I wanted to ask is whether "df" was showing the 37%
in-use statistic at the time, or was that after you rebooted.  And
although I hate to ask it, you're sure this isn't the standard "delete
an in-use file but not get the space back" Unix trap, right?
Thanks, regards,
