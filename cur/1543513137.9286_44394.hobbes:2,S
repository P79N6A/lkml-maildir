This looks somewhat like the Oopses I had and which I posted to
linux-kernel and which were ignored so far. I updated my server to
2.2.13pre14 and everything is fine for now (for about two weeks).
Could you please search the l-k archive and look whether my messages
actually arrived? I solved it with a new kernel, your solution might be the
same , but still it is a workaround and not a bugfix...

Windows NT indeed has very low Total Cost of Ownership. Trouble is,
Microsoft _owns_ Windows NT. You just licensed it.
