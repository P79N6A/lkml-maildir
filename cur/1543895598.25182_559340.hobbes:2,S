Hi,
This code adds locking around text section modifications. It can be used by
paravirt/alternatives, kprobes and eventually the immediate values to:
A - synchronize dynamic code patching
B - make sure the pages are writable
I only provided the i386 version, but it could be easily ported to other
architectures.
It applies at the end of the 2.6.22-rc4-mm2 series in the following order:
text-edit-lock-i386.patch
text-edit-lock-alternative-i386.patch
text-edit-lock-kprobes-i386.patch
Comments are welcome, (testing is welcome too)
Mathieu
