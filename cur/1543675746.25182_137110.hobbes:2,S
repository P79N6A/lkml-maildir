2.5.70-mm3 with raid1 has improved to some extent,
the RAID crash now happens somewhat later.
I got a lot of kernel errors during RAID initialization,
with normal boot messages inbetween.  Nothing made it to
the logs.  I eventually got this:
Kernel BUG at mm/slab.c:1682
invalid operand 0000 [#1]
PREEMPTSMP
CPU:0
EIP at free_block+0x276/0x350
process fsck
Call trace:
drain_array
reap_timer_fnc
reap_timer_fnc
run_timer_softirq
do_softirq
smp_apic_timer
apic_timer_interrupt
<0> KErnel panic exception in interrupt
in interrupt - not syncing
reboot in 300 seconds
This is 2.5.70-mm3, with a patch that makes
matroxfb work so I could see the entire oops.
This is a dual celeron, with 2 scsi disks.
Root & /home is on raid-1, there is also a raid-0,
all disk-based filesystems are ext2.
