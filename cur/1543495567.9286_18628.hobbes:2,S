A trick I use might possibly help in situations like this.  I have
ctrl-alt-del mapped to start a single-user-style shell, rather than
going to shutdown.  My inittab contains:
# In our case, CTRL-ALT-DEL was pressed.
#
rb::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/sulogin /dev/console
You can even resume operation with this after "halt".
