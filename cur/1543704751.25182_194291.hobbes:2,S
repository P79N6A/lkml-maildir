If you take a peek in your/Plumb's crypto/md5.c you've reduced the F1() macro
to the identical operation as the new Ch() inline function.
It reduces gcc's tenancy to re-load values in functions such like:
  (x & y) ^ (~x & z)
  (x & y) ^ (x & z) ^ (y & z)
This works out much nicer:
   z ^ (x & (y ^ z))
   (x & y) | (z & (x | y))
I've seen this in a few .c files (gcc -S blah.c; vim blah.s)
The Ch() and Maj() operations are used a lot in sha256/512.
