   OK.  I really hate working around wierd toolchain bugs (I use 2.95.4
   here and it's fine), and adding an initializer to the macro is ugly.
Mine is 2.92.11
   If you're not going to upgrade your compiler, will you accept a gcc
   patch to fix this?  If so, where can I get the source to your exact
   version?
Oh, "I'm" willing to upgrade "my" compiler, it's my users
that are the problem.  If you impose 3.1 or whatever, I get less
people testing on sparc64 as a result.
