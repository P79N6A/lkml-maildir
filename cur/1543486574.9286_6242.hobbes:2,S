A quick look at the code says you cannot turn off the automatic
creation.  net/ipv4/fib_frontend.c, fib_add_ifaddr always defines a
route to the interface address, broadcast address and prefix, as does
the ipv6 equivalent code.  Ask the net developers to add a backwards
compatibility sysctl option and see how far you can get.
Could I suggest that this discussion be taken to linux-net instead of
linux-kernel.  Reply-To set to linux-net.
