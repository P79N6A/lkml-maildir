Hi,
while porting some of my drivers to 2.6 which use the firmware loader
for example I came to the question whether to use select or enable to
achieve the desired result. Looking at the documention don't gives me
the answer and from zconf.l I feel that both options are the same. Can
anyone please explain me the differences if there are any?
Regards
Marcel
