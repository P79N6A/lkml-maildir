Subject: [PATCH] preempt abstraction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/1/8/123

The following patch abstracts access to need_resched:
	
ftp://infradead.org/pub/people/dwh/preempt-252p10.diff.bz2
It replaces most C-source read accesses to it with need_preempt() which
returns true if rescheduling is necessary.
It also replaces instances of:
	if (current->need_resched())
		schedule();
With:
	preempt();
It doesn't (or at least shouldn't) do anything else.
Cheers,
David
