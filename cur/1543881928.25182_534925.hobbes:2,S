Jeremy did your kernel have PAE enabled?
It just occurred to me that we have at all of the memory below 1M (say about
512K) mapped and available to setup new mappings.
The only way I can see a page fault happening is if you were using a PAE
enabled kernel (so you were not updating the current page tables) and
you have more than 256M of low memory, and we don't get any much extra
from always mapping 4M at a time.
