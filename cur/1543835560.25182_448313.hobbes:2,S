I suspect, if there would be a problem with tmpfs, then ramfs would be no 
different.

Agreed, but remember that tmpfs is an option, not a replacement.

Ok, I did play with main.c, and as you mentioned, initialization is subtle.  
But categorizing this patch as trivial is based more on the fact, that ramfs 
and tmpfs are semantically equivalent, and as such should not impose 
additional dependencies.
Thanks for your comments!
