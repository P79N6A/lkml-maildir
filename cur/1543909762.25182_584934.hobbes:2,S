But moving beyond 8.3 didn't prevent you from still using 8.3 names if
you wanted too.  Longer file names are just an extension of shorter
ones.

I am not even sure your idea could represent everything that is
currently possible with Posix ACLs and the standard unix permisions,
never mind SELinux.  I am also almost entirely convinced that your idea
would be amazingly slow and inefficient and a serious pain to use.  And
of course nothing seems to ever suceed without backwards compatibility
to support legacy programs until new ones take over, unless it is in
fact an entirely new concept for a new field and isn't trying to replace
some existing working system.
