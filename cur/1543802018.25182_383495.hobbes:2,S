I hate MODULE_VERSION. It stops making sense after the following
definition:
	Version of a module is a version of kernel it was shipped with.
Given:	module 8139too version 0.9.27 is buggy in somesuch way.
Question: which one?
There were quite a few nontrivial changes made since transition to git:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Christoph Lameter:
      Cleanup patch for process freezing
Jeff Garzik:
      [netdrvr 8139too] replace hand-crafted kernel thread with workqueue
      [netdrvr 8139too] use cancel_rearming_delayed_work() to cancel thread
      [netdrvr 8139too] use rtnl_shlock_nowait() rather than rtnl_lock_interruptible()
      [netdrvr 8139too] fast poll for thread, if an unlikely race occurs
John W. Linville:
      8139too: support ETHTOOL_GPERMADDR
      8139too: fix resume for Realtek 8100B/8139D
Olaf Hering:
      turn many #if $undefined_string into #ifdef $undefined_string
Pekka Enberg:
        8139too: use iomap for pio/mmio
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
None of the above changes touched MODULE_VERSION. It's still 0.9.27.
MODULE_VERSION is almost always outdated. You can't rely on it in
bugreports. All you can rely on is kernel version, be it 2.6.15-git1 or
2.6.15-0aec63e67c69545ca757a73a66f5dcf05fa484bf.
