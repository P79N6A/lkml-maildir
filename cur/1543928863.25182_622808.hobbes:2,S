yeah - anyone who claims that containers are 'fat' has likely not even 
looked at the code. Even maintainance-wise there's very visible positive 
effects: we do discover and properly map our "global resource" 
dependencies and abstract them. That increases cleanliness of our code 
and APIs all around.
