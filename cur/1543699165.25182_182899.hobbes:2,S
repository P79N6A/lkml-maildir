 You don't have the NMI watchdog working, because the timer interrupt is
configured as an 8259A interrupt ("XT-PIC" for IRQ 0 in the output above).  
This usually means the wiring of a particular system doesn't provide any
other alternative or configuration data provided by the BIOS is broken.
The timer interrupt has to be configured as an I/O APIC interrupt for the
watchdog to work, or you can select "nmi_watchdog=2" for an alternative 
watchdog internal to processors if they support it.
