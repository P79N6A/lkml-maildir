FYI,
With rc4-rt13 and changing cycle_t to u64, my machine ran all night
without one backward step.  Since it use to show up after a couple of
hours, I would say that this is the fix.
John, Do you want me to take a crack at changing the periodic_hook into
using the ktimer code?  I understand Ingo's kernel much more than you, but
you definitely understand the timing code better than I.
Cheers,
