As with Christian's driver (I'm feeling like a bit of a broken record
here :-), putting knowledge of which queue to use (which is firmware-
specific) in the _board_ support file is almost certainly wrong.
I would just put the port number in there, and let the ethernet
driver map the port number to the hardware queue number.  After all,
the ethernet driver knows which queues the firmware uses, while the
board support code doesn't.

Yay. :-)  /me hides

I generally discourage the use of such wrappers, as it often makes
people forget that the set and clear operations are not atomic, and
it ignores the fact that some of the other bits in the register you
are modifying might have side-effects.
Didn't review the rest -- not sure whether I'm looking at the latest
version.
