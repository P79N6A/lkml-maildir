	Agreed, but one of my favorites was RFC 1097, "TELNET
SUBLIMINAL-MESSAGE Option".  That one had people FURIOUS and SCREAMING
when it came out.  It was declared unethical and illegal.  Then someone
pointed out that the option code BYTE value was 257.  :->  That and
the date of April 1, 1989 (Ok, I'm an old fart) delivered a rather
major clue by four to the side of some stiff necks.  :-)
	But, yes...  Electricity over IP joins the hallowed halls of
honored April 1 RFCs...
