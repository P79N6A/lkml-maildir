Hi Steve,
   It's good to hear from you and great if you can take a look at
this. I did some more ground work and now feel bad that I didn't
report back much earlier. It appears that the problems have started
with the very first revision of 2.6.16-rt support. I am currently
writing you from 2.6.16 from kernel.org which booted fine. However
2.6.16-rt1 fails the same way as all the later kernels that I tried
with a hang right after registering the schedulers.
   To try finding a place where the problem started I also tried
2.6.15-rt21 which was the last 2.6.15-rt kernel in the pro-audio
overlay. That kernel works fine also so it seems to be something right
at the beginning of the 2.6.16 series.
   If this could possibly be something in my .config files let me know
and I'll try making changes directed by you or Ingo there.
   I hope this info might help you get to the problem a little more quickly.
Cheers,
Mark
