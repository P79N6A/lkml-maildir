Note that iosem is also a total misowner, it's not a counting semaphore
but a sleeping mutex with some special features.
Now if someone wants my two cent on how to resolve the two gazillion different
implementations mess:
 - switch all current semaphore users that don't need counting semaphores
   over to use a mutex_t type.  For now it can map to struct semaphore.
 - rip out all existing complicated struct semaphore implementations and
   replace it with a portable C implementation.  There's not a lot of users
   anyway.  Add a mutex_t implementation that allows sensible assembly hooks
   for architectures instead of reimplementing all of it
 - add more features to mutex_t where nessecary
