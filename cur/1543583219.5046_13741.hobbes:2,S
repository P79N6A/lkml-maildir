Subject: rx_copybreak value for non-i386 architectures

I notice that many net drivers set rx_copybreak to 1518 (the max packet size)
for non-i386 architectures.  Once I thought I understood it and it seems
related to cache line alignment.  However, I am not sure exactly about the
reason now.  Can someone enlighten me a little bit?
Basically I try to understand whether for MIPS architectures we need to set
this value as well.
Please CC your reply to my email address.
TIA.
