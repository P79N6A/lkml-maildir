Subject: ISDN massive packet drops while DVD burn/verify

Hello all,
I just experienced a massive ISDN problem while writing DVDs.
It looks like bigger IP packets (bigger than normal ICMP ping)
get simply dropped most of the time.
I think the packets get lost because some allocation continously fails and disk
i/o is faster in re-gaining the mem, but I am not quite sure. Could as well be
ide-scsi is partially busy-looping the box to death.
As soon as DVD writing is stopped everything comes back to normal.
Reading DVDs does not show the problem btw.
ping -s 1500 a.b.c.d shows about 5 packets, then stops.
This is with 2.4.21-pre6.
The box is:
