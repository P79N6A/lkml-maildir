Well s/sysfs_find_dirent/sysfs_get_dirent/ then. And then simply put
down the reference later.

Umm, I don't see any compounded if-else that I added that wasn't
there already ... if any are, they only make the code clearly obvious
as to what it's doing in the first place. And we've still got a common
error path. Just that the error paths do not *need* to share any other
code than the simple "return error;" precisely because it's been
cleaned up. The existing code was just horrible, IMHO.

Readability, fewer LOC, 308 lesser bytes in kernel image and
faster for the common case -- not good enough for you?! Oh, well.
