Hi all,
(nearly?) just like bart trojanowski's problem, I get tons of oops'es when 
booting into the kernel using SMP activated.
noapic cmdline does not help either.
However, I made lots some screenshots of my oops times as it sometimes even 
happens before init got spawned:

all with smp enabled, and with KV from 2.6.16 to 2.6.19.
I am currently playing with kexec/kdump to get more out of it, but don't 
expect me to get it running well (yet) ;)
However, I'd be really pleased when someone could help me out here as I'm not 
really willing to run in non-smp mode when having a second core in the box.
Many thanks in advance,
Christian Parpart.
