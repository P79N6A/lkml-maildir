Just a couple of quick questions if anyone can shed light regarding 
functions exported for modules relating to splice():
* Is there a particular reason why the useful helper __splice_from_pipe 
is exported, but not the locking equivalent splice_from_pipe or its 
equally useful helper splice_to_pipe?
* Similarly is there anything wrong with exporting the generic 
pipe-buffer operations (e.g. generic_pipe_buf_map) to save effort 
writing modules which implement splice_read and splice_write?
Are these unexported because they are unstable and not yet considered 
suitable for use, or simply because nobody's written a module that 
splice()s yet?
