Remind me again why it is that we add all these  #if 0  blocks instead
of simply removing the unused code?
It's just creating a janitorial task to go and remove all the #if 0
bits at a later time, seems like pointless churn to me. If the code
needs to go, let's just get rid of it in one go instead of two.
