Hello List,
Just a short question. For the Pentium-M as used in the centrino platform, 
what do I select in the 2.6.0-test4 kernel configuration as the CPU?
I figure it's not a PIV, but is it a P3? Or is it something special?
Thanks!
Jan

thinking about eliminating a federal program under which scientists
broadcast signals to alien beings.  This would be a large mistake.
Alien beings have nuclear blaster death cannons.  You cannot cut off
their federal programs as if they were merely poor people ...
