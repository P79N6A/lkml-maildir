It should not, it only affects, hmm, less than 10 places, each at the 
beginning of a massive call chain, e.g., in madvise_dontneed:
-	zap_page_range(vma, start, end - start, NULL);
+	zap_page_range(start, end - start, &(struct zap){ .vma = vma });

Nearly the same I think, and makes forward progress in controlling this 
middle-aged belly roll of an internal API.
