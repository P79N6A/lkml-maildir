I just checked.  The OpenAFS server supports neither lock upgrading nor lock
downgrading.  Attempts to do either incur an abort with code 0x02f6df0a
(which I believe to be equivalent to EAGAIN).
This means that I can't practically support lock upgrading.  Lock downgrading
I can emulate by handing apparent readlocks to local processes whilst holding
a writelock on the server.
