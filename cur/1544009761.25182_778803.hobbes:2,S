I think we're not talking about the same problem.  If I were to use
complete() together with wait_for_completion() there would be a problem
if fd_motor_on() can get as far as wait_for_completion() while a
previous completion is yet uncompleted.  This can not happen for
different drives, as the fd_select() would block.  If it could happen
for the same drive, the complete() would allow only one task to
continue.  The complete_all() takes care of that.
If requests are serialized for a drive so that there won't ever be two
running at the same time for certain (thinking about it, it's probable),
I could make it a simple complete().  It's hardly worth the risk,
however.
