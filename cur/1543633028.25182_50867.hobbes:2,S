Well, I guess it's similar on sparc.  I'm not sure about the size of the
save areas needed on sparc, though.  In any case both sparc and s390 are
certainly much worse w.r.t. stack space usage than i386 ...
(*Really* ugly is s390x, because we need about twice as much stack on
average than on s390, but page size is still only 4K -- most other 64-bit
platforms have 8K page size ...)
