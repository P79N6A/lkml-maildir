 That's because the 8259A does not support truly edge-triggered interrupts 
-- what it supports is a signalling model where the rising edge asserts 
the interrupt and the falling edge negates it if unhandled.  So in some 
sense it is a level-triggered interrupt with no retrigger before the 
falling edge.

 The APIC can support truly edge-triggered interrupts as it only records 
one of the edges (which one of the two it is, depends on the polarity 
setting).  It also records another edge happening between an ACK and an 
EOI and signals another interrupt immediately after the EOI, so nothing is 
lost if pulses are short (assuming there is a reasonably small number of 
sources so that overlapping pulses do not continue for too long).  There 
are subtle differences, as usually with Intel, between APIC 
implementations that may have to be taken into account here.
 Also sharing at the vector level poses interesting issues, but that's 
different matter.
