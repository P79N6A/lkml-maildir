I don't understand at this point.
Current code takes value from user, and passes it down to driver,
without any checking. If user writes 666 into the file, it will
happily pass down 666 to the driver. Driver does not expect 666 in
pm_message_t.event. It may oops, BUG_ON() or anything like that.
Shall I change 
#define PM_EVENT_SUSPEND 2
to
#define PM_EVENT_SUSPEND 1324
to get my point across? This is kernel-specific value, it should not
be exported to userland.
