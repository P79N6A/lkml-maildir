I think HT is disabled in kernel config, since I only see 2 cpus. 
In fact, I've tried to enable HT, but did'nt succeed. HT is enabled in
BIOS, but I'm not sure about exact things I must set at kernel config
level for hyperthreading. I've tried to set/unset CONFIG_SCHED_SMT, but
that changes nothing (no hyperthreading, isolated cpu is always cpu0).
Here's attached my config file.
Thanks for your interrest,
Emmanuel.
