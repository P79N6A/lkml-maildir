This is only required for smp_call_function(), since we do allbutself
by exclusing self, its the internal function that needs to do this.
allbutself shortcut takes care of it, since it doesnt matter which cpu
we write the shortcut, in the mask version and for cluster i think its required
to ensure in the low level function. Otherwise we would need each 
implementation of smp_call_function() and send_IPI_allbutself() callers would
need to do this, which would be lots of changes.
