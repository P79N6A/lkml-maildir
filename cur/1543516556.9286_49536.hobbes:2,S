Well, the more I look at a read-write semaphore, the more I like it: it
looks like something that once the semaphore implementation itself was
done, the MM side would be absolutely trivial. It does introduce a new
issue (multiple threads updating the page tables at the same time), but
that one doesn't look that horrible..
We don't ever export the page table handling to the low-level filesystems
any more (we used to a long time ago: the nopage() function got to touch
the page tables itself rather than just return the right page), so fixing
up the new issue is actually a very local fix in mm/mmeory.c.
Is anybody willing to take a stab at creating a read-write semaphore?
