Hi.  I have noticed a minor problem in modifying a fat32 partition
under Linux and then going back to win98 -- upon running Norton Disk
Doctor it sometimes complains about entries with invalid dates and
times.  Ndd fixes them with no problems.
I am not sure, but it seems to me I remember something about a
difference between a 0xff and 0x00 in some lfn entries -- could this
be the cause?
Any assistance would be appreciated.
