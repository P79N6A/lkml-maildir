The issue is that there are a number of laptops that do not properly
support cpufreq and additionally newer laptop chips halt their TSC's
when they go into C3 mode. This keeps the TSC from working as a proper
timesource on these systems, and causes the need for alternative
timesources like the ACPI PM timer.
