It can be already easily done, just patch the kernel code in /dev/kmem
and add some jump instructions to your loaded module.
But it's not practical, because it's 100% binary dependent and would
break with every small change.
Similar to kprobes. But kprobes is actually useful for kernel debugging/
tracing and unlike many other of these patches not very intrusive.
