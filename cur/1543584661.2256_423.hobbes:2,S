The implementation I posted needed no architecture-specific
knowledge.  If cost is the issue, fine -- this makes it finite,
(not infinite), and some drivers can eliminate that cost.

But it didn't handle the OHCI done-list processing, and we've heard
a lot more about pci_*_consistent being needed with OHCI than
with UHCI; it's more common on non-Intel architectures.
Given that some hardware must return the dma addresses, why
should it be a good thing to have an API that doesn't expose
the notion of a reverse mapping?  At this level -- not the lower
level code touching hardware PTEs.
