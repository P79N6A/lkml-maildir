Thanks!

Jan Kratochvil has helped me a great deal with ptrace testing lately.
We have started to collect a small regression test suite, see
http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki/utrace/tests
 for pointers.  That
has tests for individual problems that have come up, and not anything
exhaustive for testing all ptrace functionality.  The gdb test suite
is moderately torturous and more or less the standard big smoke test.
UML is also a good test, though I have never been set up to verify
anything beyond "UML seems to boot far enough to complain I don't
have a userland filesystem for it".  
Most of the changes I've submitted lately are just moving code around
and not changing its logic substantially.  So for most iterations
I've been reaosnably confident after just a few quick smoke tests
with simple manual uses of strace and gdb.
Thanks,
Roland
