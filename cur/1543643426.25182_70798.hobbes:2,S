I can list a bunch, but I know about them under heavy NDA's with anvils
looming over head.
Like what happens if a drive issues a self flush cache and receives an
error so the next issue from user/kernel space will cause the device to
internally deadlock.  Yeah this is a firmware bug, imho.  Yet when it was
to be addressed by the commitee, "NONE" of the drive vendors reported back
their behavior, iirc.  Thus the proposal was dropped.

You should come in the room sometime and watch.
It is not so much being wrong, it is all in the language.
There are things in the standard, which make Bill Clinton look squeaky
clean.  You think Clinton's "is" was bad.
Try this one, "READ_VERIFY"
You issue a write to platter, then a read_verify to have the device do an
internal comparison.  Usually a bastardized benchmark pile of dung.
Some drive vendors in the past would pull the data out of dirty disk
buffer cache, and not off the platters.  Translation it never made it to
platter, and you never know if it did.  When caught by their competitors,
the language change to "shall have been read off the platter some time in
the past".  Yet you just issued a write to platter, so that means that
data can not have been read in the past but must be in the future.
Future/Past the pull it out of cache.
