Let me first start by thanking you for all the response I got with
regard to frame grabbing with an Alpha.  A lot of people mailed iwth
helpful suggestions and information.
Now I have borrowed a grabber card with a Bt848A chip and have put it
in our Alpha (Samsung UX4 motherboard, 533Mhz 21164 Alpha).  Since
then, a lot has gone wrong.  I have by now found out that the mere act
of putting the Bt848 card into the computer will render the system
instable.  A command like
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024k count=3000 of=/tmp/junk
will die of Segmentation fault with some non-lethal kernel Oops about
being unable to map some page, usually without having written more
than 100MB.  Kernel compilation will abort prematurely, occasionally
applications will die and so on and so on.

Does any of you notice something that is supposed to tell me what is
going wrong here, and how I could amend it?
Or at least tell me where I should rather be asking about a hardware
combination that seems to put Linux on Alpha into the dizzies?
Thank you very much for the help you have provided so far,
