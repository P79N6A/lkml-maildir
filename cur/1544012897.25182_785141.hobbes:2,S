IRC between developer A and user B would be fine for user B but bad for
user C, D, E, F, G, H.  It may also be a waste of developer's A time.
Same as with personal mail.
But as David and Kyle said, you can reach many developers via IRC
anyway.  They hang out on channels with topics more focused than just
"linux kernel" because the discussions which go over IRC typically have
a narrower focus than that.
