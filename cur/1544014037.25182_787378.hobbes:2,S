We should avoid a central file and push this information
out to the Kconfig files that are at the driver site.
Then we can postprocess autoconf.h to get the filenames etc.
And IMO it is wrong to stroe the firmware files far away
from the driver where they belong.
Sorting WHENCE is a good approach under the current ways
of doing it. But the current ways of doing it looks plain wrong to me.
