Yes. Definitely the outliers appear to make the difference to the results. The
mean and range appear to be the most important on examining this data. The only
purpose to quoting other figures would be for inferential statistics to
determine if there is a statistically significant difference to the groups. My
overnight benchmarking has generated a few results and I will publish something
soon.
