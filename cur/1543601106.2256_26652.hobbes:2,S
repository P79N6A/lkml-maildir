Hi!
Today, there's no "one place" where you can get tech. specs, and a lot of
companies hesitates to even put them online. Needless to say, this is a
problem when you want to write drivers, and/or fix drivers.
What I'm thinking of, is creating a website, where the hardware creators can
supply details; upload tech. specs, write contact info, etc. And, developers
can browse this database. I was thinking of a solution where the hardware
creators could choose weither or not they wanted to make tech. specs.
public, and if they didn't a developer needed to tell the manufacturer that
he was interessted, and then the manufacturer could give needed access to
specs, and if nescesseray send the needed hardware to write a driver.
Is this a silly idea?   Do you think anyone will use such a site?  My idea
was to centralize tech. specs, to make it easier to browse them.
