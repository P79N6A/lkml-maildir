Subject: 2.2.0-pre[23] cannot modularize Packet Socket

In response for Linus' public request for testing and bug reports, I have
finally subscribed to the Linux-Kernel mailing list, and have my first report
to submit.  ( please be gentle ;^)
In both 2.2.0-pre[23] if you build Packet Socket as a module, the resulting
module af_packet.o ends up with "unresolved symbol(s)". This is not the case
in 2.1.132.  ( I didn't try 2.2.0-pre1 ):
/lib/modules/2.2.0-pre3/misc/af_packet.o: unresolved symbol rtnl_wlockct
/lib/modules/2.2.0-pre3/misc/af_packet.o: unresolved symbol rtnl
When compiled into the kernel, it works fine.
Not sure if it matters, but I'm using SMP (and it rocks!)
I am building on a RedHat 5.1 system.
I can post my full config if something else may be relevant here.
