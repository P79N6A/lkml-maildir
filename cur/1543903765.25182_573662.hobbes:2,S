Just a quick update on this Justin (thanks again for testing).  This patch 
*was* scheduled for 2.6.23 and it almost snuck upstream via Andi's tree, but 
his testing uncovered a problem at the last minute on certain AMD machines, 
so I'll have to track down that bug before we can push it.
Thanks,
Jesse
