I just booted 2.4.14-pre6 and tried to mount a diskette with an ext2
filesystem on it.  /var/log/messages reported loading the correct
version of the module (floppy.o) and then it froze hard.  Left the disk
spinning.

Works fine under 2.4.12.  There was no fs damage.
/proc/ioports in 2.4.12 says:
  000003f0-000003f5 : floppy
  000003f7-000003f7 : floppy DIR
/etc/fstab entry:
/dev/fd0        /mnt/floppy     ext2    defaults,noauto,user    0 0
Alpha, gcc-3.0.1 compiled (so is 2.4.12).
