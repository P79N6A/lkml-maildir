hm, this alone probably wont work, because the audio layer does
unlock_kernel() in many places.
could you try another hack in addition to the ioctl.c hack, save the
attached script, and do this in your Linux source tree:
	cd sound
	~/changeall-tree "unlock_kernel()" ""
	~/changeall-tree "lock_kernel()" ""
(in strictly this order.) This gets rid of the BKL from the sound
subsystem in quite drastic ways... Totally untested, so be careful ...
