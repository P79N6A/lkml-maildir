It's probably worth doing this with a static cachep in slab.c and only
exposing a get_zeroed_page() / free_zeroed_page() interface, with the
latter doing the memset to 0.  I disagree with Andi over the dumbness
of zeroing the whole page.  That makes it cache-hot, which is what you
want from a page you allocate from slab.
