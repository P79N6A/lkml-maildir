Could you be specific? This refers to page migration? Hmmm... Guess we 
would need to inc the refcount there instead?

It was tested with the GRU and XPmem. Andrea also reported success.

There are 3 different drivers that can already use it but the code is 
complex and not easy to review. Skeletons are easy to allow people to get 
started with it.

zap_page_range() called from unmap_vmas().

That can be done in a variety of ways:
1. Change VM locking
2. Not handle file backed mappings (XPmem could work mostly in such a 
config)
3. Keep the refcount elevated until pages are freed in another execution 
context.
