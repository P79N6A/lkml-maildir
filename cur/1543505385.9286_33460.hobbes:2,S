I'd guess that this is for two reasons:
a) the -l flag forces ls to stat every single file
b) not having turned off sorting forces ls to sort the contents of
   the directories in alphabetical order, which might cause creation
   of intermediate temporary files or swapping if size is very big
   (a -R does not improve this situation).
This is not a situation of Linux (IMHO) but one of UNIX. Most Unices
show this behaviour. Probably if you try  ls -fR, times should go linearly
with directory size.
But maybe I'm wrong since I did not do too much of testing.
