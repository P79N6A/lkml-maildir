I can CD into them endlessly, and both "ls -lR" and "find ." report cycles in 
the tree, which surprised me that they had a specific error message for that, 
actually.  Good enough for me. :)
And I'm not _complaining_ about it.  Just fiddling around with fun stuff.  If 
I get really bored I'll figure a way to split the tree so there are two 
completely unconnected mount trees in different processes.  (Get a private 
namespace that's chrooted into something that somebody else does a umount -l 
on from their space.  Or without using umount -l, just have two processes 
chroot into other mount points which should theoretically garbage collect the 
old root if no processes still references it, which presumably means one of 
the processes is init...)
Don't mind me, I do this for fun.
