Interesting. BTW, there is a request to introduce the mouse
into the Input/HID framework in the way PS/2 keyboard is now.
It does not overlap too much with a fix to hardware access,
but it may help to remove the multitude of broken code from
userland and direct it at your super-duper-state-machine code.
