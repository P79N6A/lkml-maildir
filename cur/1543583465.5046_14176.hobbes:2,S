It isn't just the webcache industry, heh.  I have not yet played with 2.4,
let alone under what I consider stress; but from experience with 2.2 and
eairlier I could see why one would take fbsd over linux.  Between
mysterious messages popping up on the console (be it they are related to
NIC drivers or not), and other oddities as ram and fd's fill up, fbsd
could be considered by some to be better suited.  
On the topic of perfromance, I see Todd and a few others post some
numbers, but has anyone kept track of them through kernel versions and 
drivers?   It would be interesting to see something like lmbench run on
each, and their results recorded.
I'm tempted to run various tests before and after I upgrade from 2.2.x to
2.4.x, just to see the difference ....
