indeed there is a change in the irq handling in the yenta code.
it went in after 2.6.5-bk2 and is in 2.6.6-rc1.
in the context could you send please the ouput of a pre 
2.6.6-rc1 kernel on your box:
cat /proc/interrupts 
regarding your other pcmcia i don't know if it's supported.
thanks for your feedback.
