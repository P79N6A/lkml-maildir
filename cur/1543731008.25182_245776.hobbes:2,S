Subject: [PATCH] export acpi_strict
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I sent this to acpi-devel, but probably more appropriate for the general
list, since it's not under drivers/acpi/.
Export acpi_strict for use in modular drivers.  This will enable
drivers to work around BIOS deficiencies, while still allowing the
drivers to be more picky under acpi_strict.
