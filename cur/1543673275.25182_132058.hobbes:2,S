That's it. So we have to check the version before #including
<asm/agp.h>. Then, we can do something like
#ifndef PAGE_AGP
#define PAGE_AGP PAGE_KERNEL_NOCACHE
#endif
Or am I missing something?
This is the easy part though, you probably know better than I what to do
about the functions you use that aren't available in 2.4 yet. :)
