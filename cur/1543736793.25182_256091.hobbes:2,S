there is a small but (for me) important difference ...
userspace checks for
available swap space
(all fine, still N left)
				kernel decides to
				swap out N+1 right now
				because it's urgent ..
userspace has _no_ chance
to react, and something
gets killed ...
			   .vs.
				kernel decides to
				swap out N+1 right now
				after N-M swaps, kernel
				realizes that swap space
				is low and calls
userspace, which adds
more swap space so that ...
				the kernel can continue
				to swap out stuff ...

no I haven't tried it, and I'm perfectly fine with
OOM kills and/or swappiness behaviour, seriously!
but to suggest an userspace solution which IMHO can
not be successful without kernel side support seems
to me like a "half-assed" solution ... maybe I'm
wrong and it is quite fine to assume that:
 a) userspace will detect that swap is becoming
    low just at the right moment
 b) userspace will have the additional swap available
    just right on time for the kernel to use it
 c) all delays will be just so that everything works
    out fine ... as with the OOM selection ;)

IMHO this is papering over misunderstood behaviour
by trying to _not_ ejecting 'important' people ;)

which IMHO is completely wrong, as the real solution
would be to make strict no overcommit the default and
let people who have broken^Wfunny apps enable it to
make them run ...

except that it should not be done, but as I said, that's
just my not so important opinion ...
putting that aside, thanks for your great work on linux
kernel and the time you spend on this stuff, I really
appreciate it!
best,
