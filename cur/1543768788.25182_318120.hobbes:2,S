Trond & Andrew,
Thank you both so much for your help!
The change fixed the problem we were having with the testsuite with mmap
of NFS files. We had 3 successful test runs today with the fix in place.
I found the changeset entry for this fix:
ChangeSet@1.2181.9.9, 2005-03-15 19:44:28-08:00, trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no
  [PATCH] NFS: Ensure that dirty pages are written with the right creds.
   When doing shared mmap writes, the resulting dirty NFS pages may
   find themselves incapable of being flushed out if I/O is started
   after the file was released.
   Make sure we start I/O on all existing dirty pages in nfs_file_release().                                                                                 
Cheers!
Linda
