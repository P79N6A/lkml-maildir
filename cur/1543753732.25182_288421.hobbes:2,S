In terms of time?  Probably I can, but I prefer to measure it in terms of the numbers of
operations to be performed.
With this patch, at least 8 times less memory accesses are required to restore an image
than without it, and in the original code cr3 is reloaded after copying each _byte_,
let alone the SIB arithmetics.  I'd expect it to be 10 times faster or so.
The readability of code is also important, IMHO.

Sure, but I think it's there for a reason.

I am aware of that, but you are not going to merge the hugang's patches soon, are you?
If necessary, I can change the patch to work with his code (hugang, what do you think?).
