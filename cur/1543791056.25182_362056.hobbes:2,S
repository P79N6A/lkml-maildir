"ppc" doens't do anything fancy that other archs don't do too, please
stop with your "ppc specific" thing all over the place.
It is illegal, whatever the platform is, to tap a PCI device MMIO like
that without calling pci_enable_device(), requesting resources etc... or
at the very least, testing if MMIO decoding is enabled on the chip.
Period. It has nothing to do with PPC and all to do with correctness.

Most quirk only ever use config space. BARs are _not_ guaranteed to be
set at quirk time. In fact, those devices are left disabled on purpose,
thus you should at least test if MMIO access is enabled, and if not,
avoid touching the device at all.

What _That_ code is doing in the quirks... shouldn't it be in the
{U,O,E}HCI drivers instead ?

So you rant about "ppc specific" whatever while the entire point of this
code is to workaround x86 specific BIOS junk ...
