Yes and no.  Labeled networking consists of several different subsystems
because the term "labeled networking" can often mean several different
things.  I'll spare everyone the gory details, but if you are interested in
more information check out the SELinux mailing list archives from the past
month; there has been a lot of discussion about the different types of
labeled networking and the requirements/goals of each.
NetLabel is just one subsystem that provides labeled networking
functionality (CIPSO is provided through the NetLabel subsystem), Labeled
IPsec and SECMARK also provide labeled networking functionality.  Originally
I wrote/supported/maintained just NetLabel but over the past weekend James
Morris asked me to look after all of the different labeled networking
subsystems ... for better or worse I agreed :)
If having both a labeled networking and NetLabel maintainer entry is a
problem then how about the patch below?
