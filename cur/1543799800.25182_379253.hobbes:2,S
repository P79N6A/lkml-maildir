I would second that patch.

And mozilla only does the line-wrapping (with no way that I can find to
switch it off).  It doesn't do tab->space conversion, that usually (in
my experience) results from c&p'ing from an [axe]term which outputs
spaces instead of tabs to begin with (well, it does represent a
character matrix so I don't really see another way).
Ideally (imho) one would like the 'changelog' part to be line-wrapped
(to keep it from running into oblivion) but the patch part to be left
"as is".  There is also the [PATCH] subject prefix and signed-of-by
requirements.  The only other recommendation (that I recall) is that the
changelog and the patch be seperated by '---' - but since this is part
of the initial output of the diff command this is done implicitly.
I've looked at a few clients and it seems I'm stuck with mozilla for at
least a while.  Whilst probably the buggiest client there is it does
look like it's the best suited for what I want.  I might switch to
FireFox (which iirc does have an "insert file" feature - which might
also solve this problem).
For the moment though I'm quickly hacking together a bash script that
wraps the sendmail binary that can be used specifically for submitting
patches (the intent is to perform certain checks for Signed-of-by lines,
correct [PATCH] subject and so forth).  If anybody else is interrested
I'd be more than happy to share (albeit I suspect the usefullness will
be seriously limited).
