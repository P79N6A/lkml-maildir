Given that a lot of this development will hopefully happen over the next

it doesn't make sense to make it all dependent upon BROKEN now.  Better
would be to make it dependant upon CONFIG_SOMETHING_ELSE now, which depends
upon EXPERIMENTAL and which will, around -rc6, be changed to depend upon
BROKEN.
If that makes sense.
It's all a bit unusual and complex, but this is an exceptional set of
features - let's hang in there.
