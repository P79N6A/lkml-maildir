This is from serial console.
Unfortunatly it's a portmaster2 which has no buffer.
What i do is start a screen, do a telnet to the portmaster
and attach the serial console. I can't go back anyfurther
than this since the output of the new kernel booting replaced it.
Mayby i can tell screen to have more lines of history ?!

So far, all new kernels indeed barfed with scsi errors.
It somehow seems to miss a scsi event and a chain of events occur
which also sometimes lead to shutdown ethernet interfaces.
This is the difference in IRQ settings i talked about earlier:
Linux 2.6.14-rc2-git7 (root@newsgate) (gcc 4.0.2 ) #1 1CPU
irq  0:   3736032 timer                 irq 12:         3
irq  1:         8 i8042                 irq 16:   4519576 aic79xx
irq  4:       449 serial                irq 17:  34901765 aic79xx, eth3
irq  9:         0 acpi                  irq 18:  89100231 acenic
vs
Linux 2.6.12-mm1 (root@newsgate) (gcc 3.3.6 ) #1 Mon Jun 20 11:13:18 CEST 2005 1CPU [newsgate.(none)]
