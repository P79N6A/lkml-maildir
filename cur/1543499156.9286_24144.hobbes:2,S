Hello.
if i have a pci card, does the OS map and assign base addr correctly that
the driver
can then read from the pci_dev structures returned by the pci_find_device()?
if my card has 2 base addr would the os properly map both to physical addr
that we can use
later to map?
also once you get this addr, how would one map this to kernel virtual addr?
to we can use 
ptr accesses to read from the board registers.
Cheers,
ashokr
