Yes, there can be many other variation on what u have just said, eg,
adding conditions whereby the grant can be used, etc.   If u have a
chance to learn a little bit of SELinux, u will know the whole thing
can be very complex, especially the rules and policies configuration.
 It is a fine balance between overheads vs performance and usability.

Yes, I am sure it exists...and more likely than not, it can be very
application specific, and therefore, will be done by the higher-end
application in userspace.
But looking beyond, is there any other OS that may have something
similar?  (Windows, or OpenBSD etc?)   Not sure for me.
