You'll need to set CONFIG_BITREVERSE.  Somehow.  This is going to cause
problems and I suspect we'll end up giving up in horror and just adding it
to lib-y.

serio_register_driver is exported, so we're missing a Kconfig dependency

MTOUCH selects SERIO, which seems right, so something weird is happening. 
Please send .config.
