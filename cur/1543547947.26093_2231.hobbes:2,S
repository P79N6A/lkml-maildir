Sure. I just don't see many end-users single-stepping through interrupt
handlers etc.
But yes, there probably are a few. 
But problems that tend to be hard to debug are things that don't happen
all the time. Or require special timing to happen. And I don't think
you'll find that those are very easy to attach to with a debugger either.
So the guy at the debugger end has to be really good.
Basically, I'd hate to depend on that.

That would be the CardBus controller. Yeah, still fighting that one, but
we solved another bug today. Richard Gooch would have been able to use a
debugger for that one, but I don't know what he could have done with one
in that case.
