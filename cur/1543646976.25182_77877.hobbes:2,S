I don't see these as mutually exclusive.  Documentation falls out of
date because it is often not maintained with the code.  This would
certainly be the case of a file detailing means to tweak a wide
array of settings in the kernel.
Having the settings controlled somewhere in the kernel forces the
settings to not be broken as we move forward.  This is the same
simple reason we all try to get our drivers and board ports in
the kernel proper (as being discussed elsewhere in this thread).
I believe some finer grained controls (less than 8000 hopefully)
coupled with some basic docs pointing out where they can be configured,
a description of some of the more interesting ones, and mentioning some
non-kernel tools would be quite appropriate.
