Have you fixed drivers/video/Config.in?  I just did a pull from
bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.4 and it still had the typo in the
statement for setting CONFIG_FBCON_CFB8.
On the PPC side, there is a 1-line compile fix for
arch/ppc/kernel/ppc_ksyms.c that we need (including <asm/div64.h>),
plus I have an update for the defconfigs.
Paul.
