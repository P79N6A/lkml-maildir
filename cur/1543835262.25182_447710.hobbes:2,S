So, I'm going to create kevent_create/destroy/control and kevent_get_events()
Or any better names?

Some events are impossible to create in userspace (like timer
notification, which requires timer start and check when timer
completed).
Actually all events are part of the kernel, since glibc does not have
any knowledge about in-kernel state machines which are bound to
appropriate kevents, so each kevent takes at least two syscall (create
and get ready), and I do not see how, for exmple, glibc can avoid them
when user requested POLLIN or similar event for network dataflow?
According to syscall speed on Linux, last time I checked empty syscall 
took about 100ns on AMD Athlon 3500+.
