I'm running 2.4.22, build with gcc 3.3.1, modutils 2.4.22.
I have an ATM driver that is shipped with a binary blob and a source code shim. 
  It compiles fine.  When I go to load it, I get the following error:
"The module you are trying to load is compiled with a gcc
version 2 compiler, while the kernel you are running is compiled with
a gcc version 3 compiler. This is known to not work."
Presumably the binary blob was compiled with gcc 2.x?  Is there any way to 
override this?  "insmod -f" doesn't seem to work.
Thanks,
Chris
