Correct.

The idea about an installation image generator is not so bad, BUT
not always possible. It would at least be nice if I can have a
CD-ROM and install Linux from there. Not everyone has that kind of
access to the internet, that he can install from the internet nor
does everyone has another computer to create the image. 
Always there's a need of some other company/person (i.e. computer)
to (re-)install. If you've got a desktop AND a portable, than of
course it would be possible. But there is an increasing number of
people who have only a laptop.
And even Linux sometimes needs to be reinstalled (new disk, old
disk crashed due to some orange juice...;)
I think this method of installing is nice for a company, but not
for the large public.  And BTW isn't it strange that you think to
have to instruct Linus on installing Linux?
There IS a problem: see below.

Some computers DO NOT have got parallel ports! (Just an USB connector
to connect to other things. And as long as we cannot use an USB
Ethernet adapter..... [if they exist, I dunno])
And Linus' computer is one of those...
But nevertheless, your script sounds interesting, and there can be
a good future for it.
