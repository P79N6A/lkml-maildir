List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

uart_set_options() can dereference a null pointer.  This happens
if you specify a console that hasn't previously been setup by
early_serial_setup().
For example, on ia64, the HCDP typically tells us about line 0,
so we calls early_serial_setup() for it.  If the user specifies
"console=ttyS3", we machine-check when trying to follow the
uninitialized port->ops pointer.
It's not entirely clear to me whether we should return 0 or -ENODEV
or something.  The advantage of returning zero is that if the user
specifies "console=ttyS0" and we just lack the HCDP, the console
doesn't work as early as usual, but it does start working after the
serial driver detects the port (though the baud/parity/etc from the
command line are lost).  Returning -ENODEV seems to prevent it from
ever working.
