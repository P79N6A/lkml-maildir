Hi,
Whenever I boot (2.4.4-ac6) I get this error message if there is a zip
disk in the drive.
hdb: 98288kB, 196576 blocks, 512 sector size, hdb: 98304kB, 96/64/32 CHS,
4096 kBps, 512 sector size, 2941 rpm ide-floppy: hdb: I/O error, pc = 5a,
key = 5, asc = 24, ascq = 0
The drive seems to work fine for everything except writing large files
(>500k) - umount hangs indefinitely. This has been a problem for all the
kernels I've used since I got the drive (2.2.18, 2.2.20, 2.4.0->2.4.4-ac6
series). The ide-floppy support is compiled into the kernel but I've had
similar problems when using it as a module. The disks work perfectly on a
windows box and even worked fine when I was using the drive with windows.
Can anyone shed any light on this for me?
Thanks,
Mark Phalan
