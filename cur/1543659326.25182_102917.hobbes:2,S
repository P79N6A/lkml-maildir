The ide release code isnt safe in any context.

The code is currently written on the basis that people don't mangle
free interfaces (the free up code restores stuff which I grant is
kind of ass backwards). It also needs serious review and 2.5 testing
before I'd want to move it to the right spot.
Also note that freeing the IDE can fail. If it fails then the code
should probably be a lot smarter. Right now it 'loses' the interface.
Really it should set a timer and try again. It might also want to
add a null iops (out does nothing in returns FFFFFFFF) to stop
further I/O cycles.
