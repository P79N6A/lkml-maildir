The "kernel stacks of threads" may have some bearing on my incarnation 
of this problem. We have several heavily threaded Java applications 
running at the time the live-locks occur. At our most problematic site, 
one application has a bug that can cause hundreds of timer threads (I 
mean like 800 or so!) to be "accidentally" created. This site is 
scheduled for an upgrade either tonight or tomorrow, so I will leave the 
system as it is and see if I can still cause the live-lock to manifest 
itself after the upgrade.
