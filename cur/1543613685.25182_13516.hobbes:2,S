	Where is this comming from ? Was it sent to the IrDA mailing list ?

	Why don't you just fix irlan_eth_init() ? The NETIF_F_DYNALLOC
is only used in the unregister_netdevice() functions (check your
kernel), so it's cleaner to never set the flag in the first place.
	Also : I suspect the Dag added this flag as a workaround for
some refcount problem, because with it the code does one more unref
that without. So, I suspect the refcount is broken. By the way, this
flag doesn't change the behaviour as far as waiting for people that
hold some refcount on the device.

	No, that the right way. NETIF_F_DYNALLOC is only ever used for
that. One the other hand, you might need to fix the refcount.

	Same for me.
