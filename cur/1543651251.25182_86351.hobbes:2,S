So what are the semantics for writing to the file. If I modify a setuid
(or setpartlysetuid) type file then I wan't the setuidness revoked as
happens now. That is done for very good reason. Your system appears to
need a scan of the entire file system to find directory references to
this object, done atomically.

I'll trade 500K of disk space for a working security model especially as
the case in question is not that common.
