Okay. I will try (hope I'll have the time for all!) to outline the major
driver layer models, with simple lists of advantages and disadvantages,
and to present it as a base for further discussion. (Please keep in mind
that this outline will certainly be not the best ever to exist - maybe a
lot of people around will be able to make it much better. But, anyway,
they will be given the full opportunity to criticize and improve. :-)

If you mean the abandoning of the SCSI emulation, I couldn't agree more.
Though I haven't digged into the code of this driver group, the move seems
only logical from design viewpoint.
