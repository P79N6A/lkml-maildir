I don't remember seeing any pronouncement stating that no one is
allowed to even consider systems other than the much-hyped and
not-so-much-seen BitKeeper, so pitching this kind of fit at
Peter Miller is a bit presumptuous.
Yes, you think you have a great product. Good. It'd really be a
problem if you didn't. But you have to accept that not everyone will
be immediately convinced, especially since very few of us have ever
seen it.

There's this invention you might be interested in. It's called
a "tape drive". It's pretty new, so I'll understand if you haven't
heard of it. It's pretty cool, though -- it actually lets you make
backup copies of your files in case something bad happens. If it does, 
you can restore from tape, and just like magic your files are back!
You can even automate the use of one of these amazing things.
Sorry for the sarcasm, but he's right. Filesystem corruption is NOT
the problem of each individual application. If you stand to lose
billions of dollars worth of data by losing a disk, then perhaps you
should look into frequent backups.

Sure, having an application detect corruption can be cool. But with a
reasonably stable operating system and a tiny bit of effort put into
backups, it's not even close to the showstopper you make it out to be.
My lab uses CVS for its work. We keep our repository in an AFS volume
that gets backed up every now and then. Sometimes CVS fucks up and
trashes something. When that happens, we send mail to the department's 
computer facilities folks, and they restore the volume for us. Over
time, I lose far more data to my own idiocy than to CVS not handling
file corruption.

"clearly better product". Can I download BitKeeper _right now_? If
not, then it's not a clearly better product in any way. It's simply a
prettier cloud of vapor. Boast about how cool it is when it's
released, not before.
Also, at our lab we have a variety of projects. Some, like the NASD
code, end up being released as free software. Some, like some of our
video scheduling work or some of the VIA stuff we're doing, cannot be
released as free software due to various NDAs or patent restrictions
(grumble). Because of that, I'm not comfortable with putting my
changelogs on the web.
From the pricing on the chart at www.bitkeeper.com, it seems that
BitKeeper would cost me $136,000 to use for the roughly 40 grad
students, faculty, staff, and undergrads around here, using the "one
time buyout" plan. By contrast, Perforce would cost $1000/year, since
they have an educational discount. But even if they didn't, it'd be
$23,000 for the first year plus $4800/year of support after that. 
$136,000 is a lot of money. Maybe it really is a great product, but
that's still a lot of money. Say I use a system for three years. By my
simple little math, I'd have spent $32,600 on Perforce by the end of
it and $136,000 on BitKeeper. That's over 4 times as much, so pardon
me if I continue to be interested other source control options.

If I use BitKeeper, what assurance do I have that BitMover will stand
behind it for 20 years? I don't want to be a doomsayer, but we've all
heard the statistics on how many startups make it. If the unfortunate
happens and BitMover tanks, what happens to me and my BitKeeper
license? Am I screwed?
The worst cases you're talking about for Aegis are exactly the same as 
the worst cases for BitKeeper. Actually, they're better -- I may not
get much support, but at least I'm not out an eighth of a million
dollars.
So, basically, please take your marketing elsewhere. To take a common
phrase from the free software world, don't talk, show us the code.
