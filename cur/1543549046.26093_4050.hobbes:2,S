Linus, please think this over before applying Andi's patch.

This is an old problem.  There was a thread on this topic last March.
Look for "accept() improvements for rt signals".
SI_SIGIO is not the only signal that's broken: SI_ASYNCIO, SI_TIMER and
SI_MESGQ have the same problem.  When those signals are used you'll be
adding more and more exceptions to the SI_FROMUSER macro.
(For example the POSIX timers patch actually does exactly the same as
Andi's patch, but for SI_TIMER instead of SI_SIGIO).
It's obvious that SI_SIGIO, SI_ASYNCIO, SI_TIMER and SI_MESGQ should all
return false from SI_FROMUSER, assuming SI_FROMUSER is the right thing
to use in any case.

That looks like major band-aid.  What does SI_FROMUSER mean anyway?
I looked it up on the web.  It doesn't appear in manual pages on the web
in general, and I didn't find it in Single Unix.  Let's investigate.
/*
 * si_code values
 * Digital reserves positive values for kernel-generated signals.
 */
Hmm...  Inherited from Digital Unix perhaps?
Let's try Digital UNIX V4.0F... /usr/include/sys/siginfo.h:
/* negative si_codes are reserved for user-generated signals */
#define SI_QUEUE        -1      /* sent by sigqueue */
#define SI_USER         0       /* sent by kill, sigsend, raise, etc. */
#define SI_NOINFO       1       /* unknown source */
#define SI_TIMER        0x10    /* sent by timer expiration */
#define SI_ASYNCIO      0x20    /* sent by AIO completion */
#define SI_MESGQ        0x40    /* sent by realtime mesq state transition */
#define SI_FROMUSER(siptr)      ((siptr)->si_code <= 0)
#define SI_FROMKERNEL(siptr)    ((siptr)->si_code > 0)
Looks like DEC got this right, Linux blindly copied some of the
definitions and made up some of the others (by setting SI_TIMER etc. to
negative values but keeping the same definition of SI_FROMUSER).
_Something_ of binary compatibility will have to be broken to fix this
problem.  Either change the SI_TIMER etc. signal numbers, or change the
SI_FROMUSER macro.  Both of can potentially break applications.
Changing SI_SIGINFO would obviously be the most serious.
I'd posit that changing SI_FROMUSER is the right fix.
But changed to include SI_TIMER, SI_MESGQ and SI_ASYNCIO as well.
Andi says:

Actually rt_sigqueueinfo has this test hard-coded in it:
	if (info.si_code >= 0)
		return -EPERM;
with a comment "not even root is allowed to send signals from the
kernel".  Changing SI_FROMUSER won't affect this.
Perhaps it should.  Do we consider SI_SIGIO, SI_TIMER etc. to be in the
"not even root is allowed" category or not?
have a nice day,
