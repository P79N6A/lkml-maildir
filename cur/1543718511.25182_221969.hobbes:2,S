Will it suffice to add
#define FBINFO_FLAG_MODULE FBIF_MODULE
for backwards compatibility?
I'd prefer the new flags to be FBIF_*, as the identifier
FBINFO_FLAG_HWACCEL_COPYAREA seems sorta long to me...
I'll sync with linus's bk tomorrow and try to rework my main patch; the
"mainline" patch I posted was against his bk shortly after 2.6.6...

I take it this is in addition to your con2fb patch I have posted at that web
address?
