For me:
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/b2/tmp/swap bs=1024 count=26528
26528+0 records in
26528+0 records out
# ls -al /b2/tmp/swap
-rw-r--r--   1 aeb      users    27164672 Sep 22 22:37 /b2/tmp/swap
# mkswap /b2/tmp/swap
Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 27160576 bytes
# swapon /b2/tmp/swap
#
So, first observation: you have an old mkswap.
Second observation: I presume that because of some aliasing,
the swap signature was not seen at first. The present mkswap
source says:
        /*
         * A subsequent swapon() will fail if the signature
         * is not actually on disk. (This is a kernel bug.)
         */
        if (fsync(DEV))
                 die(_("fsync failed"));
that is, current mkswap already does the sync that you did by hand.
It has been required for a long time.
