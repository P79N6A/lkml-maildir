I'd like to see data which supports this.  CPUs have gotten so fast and
disk I/O still sucks.  All the systems I've seen are CPU rich and I/O
starved.  The smartest thing you could do would be to get a cheap box
with a GB of ram as a disk cache and make it be a SAN device.  Make
N of those and you have tons of disk space and tons of cache and your
8 way opteron database box is going to work just fine.
