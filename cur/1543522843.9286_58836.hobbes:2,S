After looking a little closer, it appears that it doesn't support the
cardbus anymore.  the ixxxxx (forgot number) seems to only support ISA
cards.  Yenta seems to support cardbus (or this is what I gather from the
little bit I saw in the source).  The controller is ricoh rl5c478 which is
detected as an Intel pcmcia isa controller.  I attempted to load yenta, but
it doesn't work.  At this point, saying what cards I use is pointless.  This
is on an NEC Versa SX laptop (I'm sure the LX will have the same problem). 
insmod says yenta doesn't have any kernel version information (all pcmcia
compiled as modules)

I keep forgetting about this.  I wasn't sure since the config help said
ethernet adapters for acm.
