Whew.. that wasn't easy to spot... When doing PS/2 emulation for touchpads
that use absolute events, when processing BTN_TOUCH event mousedev would
stop on the very first client. So in your normal case only GPM would see
the Synaptics but once you killed GPM XFree would be the first in line and
magically start working.
My guess you didn't see that in stock 2.6.0 because you were compiling
without Synaptics support.
I am sending 2 patches - one to remove mouse jitter with Synaptics when
it is used through mousedev (PS/2 emulation) - mousedev will use 3 point
history and average when calculating deltas, the other one is the fix for
the problem you are experiencing. They should apply to 2.6.0-mm1 and to
stock 2.6.0 with minimal jitter.
