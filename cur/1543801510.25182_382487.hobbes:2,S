That definately seems weired, but I never ran into it till now...

Just to rewrite that in iproute2

Very good testcase!
Any IP gurus? Ideas on why is such behaviour observerd?
Does it have to do something with the driver for ethX being notiefied of the link status and thus
hardware (PHY?) is shut down so signal from the wire is ignored?
Or down the ARP somewhere?
Cannot think of security exploit at the moment, but there should be one...
Kalin.
