My question is a natural extension of this point and subsequent posts, 
When is a kernel so tainted it can no longer be considered GPL, or can 
no longer be considered free software? I write software for astronomical 
applications where some vendors give binary only drivers, or give you 
restricted access to the source code so I will some times load 5 or 6 
devices that are binary only or at least non GPL. So what taint is 
allowable?
Thanks,

PS sorry if this is a stupid question.
