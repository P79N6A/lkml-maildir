I'm using:
03:03.0 SCSI storage controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. MV88SX6041 
4-port SATA II PCI-X Controller (rev 07)
but with 
http://www.keffective.com/mvsata/FC3/mvSata-3.4.2a-patched.tbz
 driver
and it works nicely (+ 2.8GHz Xeon HT, smp kernel). I was quite suprised to 
see that there are no problems with it in typical usage (while I'm sure that 
this driver is far away from kernel standards).
