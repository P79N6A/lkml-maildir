Counted to 100000000 in 1674492 us
That means that I can count to 478468 in 8ms.

Linux version 2.2.5 (wolff@cave) (gcc version 2.7.2.1) #1 Mon Apr 12 11:19:19 MEST 1999
The "verification" run has 5 "usleeps" in it, because I'm too lazy to
multiply 478468 by 5.
So, by usleeping 500 times, the running time increases by 20%, and
the accounted running time goes from 4.02 to 0.02....
Also note that 2.2 sleeps for 2ms (incorrect?) while 2.0.x sleeps for
12 ms at a time....
I'm suggesting that Rik's new algorithm will allow this program to
grab about 80% of the CPU even if there is another CPU-hogger around.
(of course, none of this is accounted, so looking at "top" is not
going to tell you that this program is taking 80%, you have to deduce
that because it is taking 5 seconds realtime to count to 239234000...)
