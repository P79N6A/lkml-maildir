I looked into that as well, and I do have a generic binomial heap
implementation that I plan on test as well.

Fibonacci heaps, for instance. I looked into that as well. However, it's
actually more important to have (if possible) O(1) extraction than
insert. Extraction is typically run from interrupt context, when a
driver wants to requeue more requests because it has completed one (or
some). That was a worry with the rbtree solution. The linked list may
have had sucky O(N) insert, but extraction was a nice O(1). So far I
haven't been able to notice any regression in this area, regardless.
