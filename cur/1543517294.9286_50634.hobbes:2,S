Ok, but to have three additional lines in the (pci-only) drivers wouldn't
blast the whole driver-area.

I don't agree that we need a huge database (for what?). If a driver's
available for that pci-device ('lspci -n') the driver itself should know
it!!
I don't want to know which device it is, i only want to know, if there's
a driver for it in /usr/src/linux/drivers - without the effort to know
exactly the brand or something else. Start with the information provided
with 'lspci -n' and you'll see how hard it is to get info if the device is
supported. Sometimes the 'plain numbers' are written in the documentation,
but often not!
If you think about a huge database, someone must take care of it. I think
information provided by the PCI-Chipset should be good enough to decide
such things as mentioned above...

Why? Isn't /etc/pci.ids just such a database?

No, you must think of two ways:
1. Uncompiled source
   Now you can run 'the script', and this script is doing internally 
   'lspci -n'. After that it goes through the drivers-dir hunting for
   sourcecode which meets the class/vendor/device-id (grepping
   MODULE_PCIVENDOR,MODULE_PCIDEVICE and MODULE_PCICLASS). Then such
   a script can make a config. after making the kernel it should contain
   all pci-drivers which the kernel supports...
2. Precompiled modules as binaries
   E.g. a distributor makes ALL modules and use a modified modinfo-program
   to determine from the module.o for what device it is and therefore
   install it into /lib/modules, if it meets 'lspci -n'...

Is it now clearer?
