Hi,
have tried the same test (mem=8M, make bzImage on UP-box) with vanilla
2.4.0-t9p7. Seems to work for me too: no VM-problems (deadlock, fatal OOM)
after more than 10h of heavy paging. X-3.3.6 apparently has no problems
either, although far from being useable with mem=8M.
However, there is one thing I've changed besides using t9p7: to save
my disk the swap partition on another disk on the second IDE-channel was
used instead of the one on the first, where all mounted ext2-fs's are.
Hence I might have benefit due to some parallel IO. But I believe the
deadlocks happened within the paging code path, thus the parallel access
to the normal fs for .c/.o/tmp rw wouldn't help. Rereading flushed pages
from gcc-binaries on /usr/bin may have relaxed the stress to some extend.
The total time for make bzImage however was not reduced significantly.
BTW, some numbers about scalability - using make bzImage of t9p7 with
identical .config on fresh-booted box as some kind of benchmark:
mem=    total duration   max. swap used   kswapd-time   CPU-idle
128M        10 min             0             0           0%
 32M        11 min             5M            1 sec      <5% (but peaks)
 16M        32 min            20M           45 sec     osz. 40+-30%
  8M       6.5 h              13M           28 min      75% (+-20%)
These numbers must not be over-interpreted - just to give an idea.
Regards
Martin
