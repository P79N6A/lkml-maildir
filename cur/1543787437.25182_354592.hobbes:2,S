I am dubious about this change.  I don't see a corresponding change to
fs/proc/array.c where it knows what all the bit values are.  I am not at
all sure there aren't other places that know these values and need a fixup
if you change them.
Any tests using < TASK_STOPPED or the like are left over from the time when
the TASK_ZOMBIE and TASK_DEAD bits were in the same word, and it served to
check for "stopped or dead".  I think this one in do_signal_stop is the
only such case.  It has been buggy ever since exit_state was separated.
Changing the bit values doesn't fix the bug that it isn't checking the
exit_state value.  This patch is probably the right fix for that, but I
have not tested it.
