I haven't had a chance to really get into it, but here's what I've found.
It -only- happens on one machine I have, it's a p166.
The process gets stuck reading /proc in the following:
ide_pci_chipsets, and iirc, had something to do with WCHAN being something
close to: wait_on_buffer
I don't have a vmlinux kernel on this machine so I can't get more exact details
yet.  (compiling)
However, it's still in 2.3.13 and pre14-1
