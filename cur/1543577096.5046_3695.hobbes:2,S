Hi folks,
I have 2 servers with lvm trouble, one running
Red Hat 6.2,  and the other running Red Hat 7.0
plus latest errata.
Both systems had been running lvm-0.8
on 2.4.0-test for awhile with no problems.
After instaling 2.4.0-prerelease and building
the lvm 0_9-1  source rpm on both systems,
I get the identical error on both systems:
# vgscan
vgscan: error while loading shared libraries: vgscan: undefined symbol:
lvm_remove_recursive
Except for lvm, all is running well.
Any clues?
Andrea? Heinz?
