Hello!
My realtek-8169 based NIC doesn't work with 2.6.
Kernel versions tried: 2.6.7, 2.6.7-mm7.
Works OK with 2.4.26.
Symptoms: after few dozen packets, transfer stops,
both with TCP and with flood ping.
I can revive NIC by doing ifdown and ifup again.
The card is NetInfo NA-G32:

I'm trying to use this NIC with AMD750-based motherboard (Gigabyte 7IXE4).
Is there any other info I can supply you with to debug this problem?
