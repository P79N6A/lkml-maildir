We're still running 2.6.16 kernels on a bunch of machines, though 2.6.19
has been looking pretty nice on the couple of machines that are testing
it.  2.6.17 and 2.6.18 felt less stable.
We do a lot of Cyrus which does a lot of MMAP - and we also use the 
Areca driver - which are both strong reasons to move to 2.6.19.2, but
if the MMAP fix was ported back to 2.6.16 we might consider staying
there instead.
