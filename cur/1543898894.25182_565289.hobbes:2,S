Subject: dead(?) i386-related CONFIG variables

  since it's not clear who a single contact person would be for
i386-related stuff like this, here's what my script turned up for
tests on non-existent CONFIG variables under arch/i386:
========== BALANCED_IRQ_DEBUG ==========
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c:356:#ifdef CONFIG_BALANCED_IRQ_DEBUG
========== DEBUG_PAGE_TYPE ==========
arch/i386/kernel/vmi.c:238:#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGE_TYPE
========== SERIAL_DETECT_IRQ ==========
arch/i386/kernel/legacy_serial.c:18:#ifdef CONFIG_SERIAL_DETECT_IRQ
  feel free to take this as seriously as you want.  :-)
