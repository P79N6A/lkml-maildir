Renato,
could you please turn on the HID debugging support ("Device Drivers -> HID 
devices -> HID debugging support" in menuconfig of any reasonably recent 
kernel) and show the output that appears when the joystick is plugged in, 
and also when you generate the events that are messed up? This would 
hopefully avoid any confusion regarding what is really going on and we'll 
see what we can do with it.
Thanks,
