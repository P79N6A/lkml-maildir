In latest kexec code I do see it syncing. But it does not unmount the
filesystems. So this comment looks like partially wrong.

Which kexec-tools you are using? 
syncing is initiated by user space so changing kernel will not have
any effect (as long as user space is same). I think just that message
are spitted by kernel, so probably 2.6.18 did not spit any message and
2.6.24 does.

Kexec has got an option -x --no-ifdown, which will not bring the network
down. Try that. "kexec- -e -x"

To me it makes sense. Just making sure that cache changes make to the file
system before you boot into new kernel.
In latest kexec-tools, I do see sync() is done first and then network
interfaces are brought down. 
Try latest kexec tools from:
http://www.vergenet.net/~horms/linux/kexec/kexec-tools/testing/kexec-tools-testing-20071017-rc.tar.gz
and see if it works fine for you.
