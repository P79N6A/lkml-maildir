Perhaps we can go organize a fundraiser for SuSE so they can go out and buy 
an ISAPnP soundcard. I have a few I can sell. I promise I won't overcharge 
them (much).

Did look, but decided there wasn't much more specifically to add. It's 
something more fundamental about the flow of things and while the comment 
above is obviously cynical I did grow a bit tired of a series of patches 
that just transported the OOPS two lines down again each time, so I held out 
for Bjorn as well.
Still availabe for tests.
Rene.
