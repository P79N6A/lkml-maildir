Correct - both queues can be active with I/O in flight at the same
time.  But think about it: if this weren't the case, then the older
kernels (using global io_request_lock) would have had to serialize ALL
I/O, one request-queue active at a time, for every single
block-device...

I'm not quite sure which problems you mean.  The busy flag prevents any
clash. (But sure, if you change to per-device queues AND you ditch the
busy flag you're screwed.) Where is the problem?
