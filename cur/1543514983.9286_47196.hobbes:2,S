The main ways to modify kernel data from userspace would be
 * regular syscalls
 * ioctl
 * sysctl and /proc
 * modules i.e. create_module
Note that all four methods go through syscalls.  The first three also
place strict limits on what kernel code can be executed.  A module can
call any kernel code whose address it knows, i.e. exported functions by 
linking, or anything else if you want to fish around in System.map.
