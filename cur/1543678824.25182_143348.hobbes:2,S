it tracks 2.5 but I think the bug is the same; it appears
the relevant code has changed but I think the root issue
probably is the same (ide-scsi reset error handling causing
kernel to crash).  The bug submitter for the original bug
said he gets the same behavior on 2.4, but he didn't yet
respond as to whether killing magicdev fixes his problem.
Maybe they're different problems, but they appear related.
