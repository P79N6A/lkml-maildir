I think we should change __kernel_pid_t now that we are changing __kernel_uid_t.
a) It is easy - easier than the change to larger uid.
Roughly speaking the only change is in the ipc structs.
(The other part of the change is in /proc.)
b) The reuse of pids causes security problems.
c) 32000 processes is not enough.
d) There is a speed advantage:
Right now when a process is spawned we have to find a pid for it,
and with a few thousand threads a significant part of the 32000
pids allowed today will be in use, so that often get_pid() will
have to walk the entire task list. If we are sure that a pid is
never reused, then
get_pid() {
	return ++last_pid;
}
suffices. Even when reuse occurs, the current get_pid() will
be much more efficient when a larger pid-space is available.
(On the other hand, if we do not enlarge the pid_t size, then
a bitmap with pids_in_use would make get_pid() much faster.)
In fact, I like high uptimes, and a system in which the same pid is never
used again. But this means that 32 bits may not be enough. That again
means that I would like to see padding in places like
struct msqid64_ds {
		...
	__kernel_pid_t msg_lspid;       /* pid of last msgsnd */
        __kernel_pid_t msg_lrpid;       /* last receive pid */
        unsigned long  __unused4;
        unsigned long  __unused5;
};
that is, I would prefer to see there
	__kernel_pid_t msg_lspid;       /* pid of last msgsnd */
	unsigned long  __unused4;
	__kernel_pid_t msg_lrpid;       /* last receive pid */
	unsigned long  __unused5;
so that it will be easier to go to 64-bit pids twelve years from now.

[I may still have some usable patch fragments for getpid and family.]
