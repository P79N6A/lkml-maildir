I'd agree *if* my changes hurt performance. I've already demonstrated
that even the general case sees a net improvement.

They want POSIX RT == soft-RT. Is that specific enough? Is it such a
strange concept to want to use POSIX RT?

I don't agree. I think there is some overlap. I don't think it's as
black-and-white as you make out.

Perhaps I misinterpreted you. I felt that you were labelling and
dismissing those (not just local colleagues) who supported my ideas.

You never seem to address this point. If you don't like the idea of
better RT in the kernel, then look at it this way: my changes provided
a net improvement for non-RT processes. Think of it as just another
optimisation. A bit of cycle shaving.
I'll mention that you also have ignored other points I've brought up,
such as the current scheduler being complicated, messy and fragile. If
a change is cost-neutral at worst, and tidies up the code, then why
object so strenuously?

Cough! You wouldn't say that if you knew the politics involved.

Time will tell. In any case, since we don't seem to be convincing each
other, why not agree to disagree? You don't bother addressing other
points I raise for some reason, so the debate seems a bit pointless.
