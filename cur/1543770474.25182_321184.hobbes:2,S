Subject: 2.6.12-rc[2-5] hangs when umounting initramfs

I originally started with an initrd and later changed to initramfs.
I mount tmpfs to /newroot, populate /newroot, pivot_root to /newroot (via
pivot_root . initrd), kill off everything running on the old root and umount
/initrd.
When I boot and I load a ramdisk image via initrd, umount works and
everything continues.  When I send a compressed cpio via initrd and umount,
the system hangs.  No messages, no keyboard response, nothing.  sysrq works,
but since the kernel I built was designed with size in mind, the information
isn't very useful.
When I do sysrq-t, it shows mount as running.  Not actually sure if it is.
