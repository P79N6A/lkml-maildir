Because your crashes where caused by blindly assuming the sk would never
be NULL in xfrm_lookup(), and it clearly was. The simple debugging
printk() I suggested you insert with your code would have shown you that
that was the reason for your crashes.
And if I was feeling nice that day, which is possible, since it was
Christmas Eve, I may have even put the printk() in myself and tested.

I have no idea. You have the code, and probably as much understanding of
the networking stack as I do. I suggest you use find and grep to track
down the what you are interested in, and how xfrm_lookup() is called in
various situations. Take good notes, especially about avenues of
exploration that come time mind as you chase one code path. It's not
very hard, it's how I learned.
