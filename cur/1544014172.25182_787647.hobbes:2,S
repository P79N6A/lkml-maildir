Maybe somebody has thought of this before.  But I think it would be
useful to have a mount flag telling the filesystem layer that a certain
filesystem never ever needs to be synced, even when the 'sync' system
call is called.
My /tmp, for example, is reformatted on each and every boot.  There is
no reason for anything written to /tmp to ever hit the disk.  The only
reason is to make room for something else in memory.
I think this could potentially help out notebooks that only had solid
state drives.
Anyway, just a random thought,
