Before I look at the code, and with a notice that I haven't had my
morning juice yet...
It seems to me a spin_lock_irq_nested() thing is redundant, because:
The lock must obviously be held hardirq safe and nested implies one is
already held. Hence the context is already hardirq safe thus using
spin_lock_irq/spin_unlock_irq is wrong because it will enable irqs and
destroy the irqsafe guarantee for the parent lock.
Obviously I'm missing something here.. otherwise you wouldn't need it.
As I'm very much not familiar with the IRQ code, could you spell it out
to me?
