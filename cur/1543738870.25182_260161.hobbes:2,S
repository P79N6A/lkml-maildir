Just what sort of time changes do you want to notify on?  The ntp code "drifts" 
time a lot.  Do you want to know about this?  If it is only cases where there is 
a jump in time, you might do well to look at "clock_was_set()".  It is in 
kernel/posix-timers.c and is called when ever do_settimeofday() is called AND on 
leap second calls.
You will even find code in there to push the ladder out of the softirq context.
