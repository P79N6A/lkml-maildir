Other random stuff it saves our backside on we don't know about.

Disagree. I want it robust. If you want to set low retry counts then
the user should do so for special cases like forensics.

Making it configurable is good, but I can't help feeling that this
belongs at the block layer - I wonder what Jens thinks, it might well
have to be done by the driver because only the driver knows enough but
the ioctl/config option ought to be common.

M/O media retries generally do the right thing and have the right
effect. If you want to know if your drive is failing use SMART and ask
the drive
Remember: Storage appliance not disk. Treat it like a storage
appliance and you'll get better results.
