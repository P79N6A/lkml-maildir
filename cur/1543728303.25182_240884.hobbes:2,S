The patch seems to work well! It doesn't apply completely cleanly
to my sources... maybe I left some of my own stuff in. On reboot, with
keyboard attached, I get this:
uart_close: bad serial port count; tty->count is 1, state->count2
  while rebooting the system.

Restarting system.

Mine is a VIA chipset with an AMD processor:

How do I fetch the exact information that would be needed for a DMI entry?
Thanks much,
