I could see it going either way I guess.  The other thing the class_match could
do is create those symlinks from the two classes of devices.  What other way is
there from userspace to see which lcd device is associated with fb device?

Yea I see that, but I was trying to keep all the class related code contained in
class.c  I feel kinda uncomfortable manipulating lists and locking locks in
struct class from outside code.

Why not?  I see it as a simple extension of the class_interface stuff... it
could even use the class_interface to implement class_match (or use
class_interface directly in the lcdbase.c code and forget the class_match stuff).
Now I could see both solutions as workable and either one or even a bunch more
could work for the lcd/fb matching.  Now the question is, which one to implement?
Or actually, the question is, which one is more likely to be accepted into the
kernel?
The way I see it, we really need a policy decision here, and neither you nor I 
are "authorized" to make that decision :)  We have two completly seperate devices,
both have a struct device and both have a struct device_driver.  They can sit on
completly seperate buses and be mixed together in lots of different combinations.
One of the devices "knows" if it matches with the other device.
What is the linux preferred way to dynamicly match the two devices together?  Should
each driver pair make its own decisions and its own constructs, or should we try and
extend the device/driver/class/bus/etc model to support matching two devices together?
Use waitqueues and probe functions?  notify.h?  match by a char *name? class_match?
class_interface? create a virtual bus and use the bus matching code (not a very good
solution, but one nonetheless)?  Secondly, what is the best way to represent this
matching to userspace (sysfs)?
We already tried matching together devices by their name, and that was shot down.
And yet the mtd code matches chips and maps together by their name...  We haven't
really gotten much feedback in which ways of matching devices together is acceptable
and which isn't.
