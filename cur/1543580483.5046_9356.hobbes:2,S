Personnaly I donnot need to know how windows handle this in order to
figure out how it should be properly handled.
In theory, the signature should be checked prior to any change in the
device configuration space. But since PCI BIOS assigning of resource
windows is complete mess-up, the O/S has to probe BAR sizes. The probing
of BAR sizes does not seem to harm. This done, given that it is possible
then to first check the signature and to leave quiet the device if it is
owned by RAID, there is no valuable reason to still tamper the device for
nothing if it is not to be attached.

Can you swear that the code will never change ?
Anyway, the current code at least enables response to IO and to MEM based
on existing BARs. This probably does not harm but this should be done on
behalf of the software driver and based on actually _used_ resources. On
the other hand, the complex enabling of IRQ is really something we want to
avoid in situation where it is not actually useful.
End of story, since moving pci_enable_device() in its preferred place as I
suggested is an obvious minute change.
