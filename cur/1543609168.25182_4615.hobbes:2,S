Hmmm, with ext3 that would not help you very much I think, given that the
journal is replayed before the fsck is performed (fsck can replay a journal
file). So if there's garbage in the journal, it might make its way into the
filesystem. Or it might confuse fsck...
I use reiserfs on another disk in the same box, which does not suffer from the
long fsck times, but does put a quite heavy load on the CPU during intense file
operations. Simple tests with ext3 seem to indicate that it suffers less from
this problem.

Yeah, same here. I decided to try a Linus kernel 'cause of some unexplained and
unwarranted slowdowns - especially in interactive applications.
With mixed results, the slowdowns seem to be gone but other problems appear
(like the vmware hangs). I'm back to -ac for the moment (running 2.4.13-ac5,
waiting for others to bend or break the IDE patches :-)
