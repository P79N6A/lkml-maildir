Subject: PRE 2.3.40-5 make xconfig doesn't have working PCMCIA selection options.

"make xconfig" does not yield usable PCMCIA option dialogs
in pre-patch 2.3.40-4 or pre-patch 2.3.40-5.  When I look at
the PCMCIA dialog accessed through the "General setup" dialog,
all selections are greyed out, as are all subsequent PCMCIA-related
options under "Network device support" and "Character devices."
Will this be fixed in 2.3.40?
Thanks,
	Miles
