So we should enable netfilter for all x-hundred webservers we have?  Or play games with routing tables?
Why was something which:
a) works
b) was present in 2.2.xx kernels
c) is trivial to include and doesn't seem to 'hurt' anything
ripped from 2.4 kernels?
What some people fail to grasp is that _many_ people in the real world are using the hidden flag in load balancing scenarios for its simplicity.  Removing it (without any particularly valid reason that anyone is aware of) doesn't make much sense.
