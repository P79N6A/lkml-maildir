Simple irq's are special, see the comment above handle_simple_irq:
Simple interrupts are either sent from a demultiplexing interrupt
handler or come from hardware, where no interrupt hardware control
is necessary.
Note: The caller is expected to handle the ack, clear, mask and
unmask issues if necessary.
Simple irqs are used for low level demultiplex handlers, where the full
control of the irqchip is in the low level handler.

    In commit 76d2160147f43f982dfe881404cfde9fd0a9da21 lazy irq disabling
    was implemented, and the simple irq handler had a masking set to it.
    Remy Bohmer discovered that some devices in the ARM architecture
    would trigger the mask, but never unmask it. His patch to do the
    unmasking was questioned by Russell King about masking simple irqs
    to begin with. Looking further, it was discovered that the problems
    Remy was seeing was due to improper use of the simple handler by
    devices, and he later submitted patches to fix those. But the issue
    that was uncovered was that the simple handler should never mask.
    This patch reverts the masking in the simple handler.
