There's a problem with internal APIs --- it's hard to make one which is
general-purpose.  The main problem is that we need to interoperate with
a bunch of existing filesystems all of which specify ACLs in their own,
incompatible ways.  Think of CODA, AFS, NTFS, JFS etc.
linux-fsdevel@vger.rutgers.edu is probably the best place to throw ideas
around if you want to help get something agreed, though.
