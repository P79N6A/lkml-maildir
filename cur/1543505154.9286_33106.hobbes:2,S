First of all, one can not avoid wide numbers for this. You can not
use an #ifdef to avoid the problem.
The question then becomes: Use "long long" or not?
All platforms can do 64-bit calculations via "long long", with the
compiler emulating as needed. Older versions of gcc could be slow,
but this problem has been fixed.
Even though I have an old gcc, I'd prefer letting the compiler handle
the job. Using "long long" would make the code more maintainable.
Somebody actually using this new feature will need a new libc anyway,
and I think libc now requires the newer compiler.
