greetings all,
  I apologise for the somewhat vague descriptions here, but Im no 
experienced Kernel Hacker. I'm in my 3rd month of Linux (RedHat 7.1) and was 
disappointed by the lack of my USB devices (printer and scanner and 
keyboard). I managed to replace the keyboard for PS/2 one. So, i decided to 
upgrade kernel to 2.4.13.
The USB Support I built in is now killing my PC.
usb.c: Registered new driver iforce
Thats my last boot message before the system freezes, so Im guessing 2.4.13 
doesnt properly support the USB stuff I have.
If theres a fix for that, or if its a common problem that everyone building 
USB support into their kernels has, I'd appreciate knowing in either case. 
If it is something im doing hiddeously wrong, please feel free to shout at 
me.
Thanx all.
