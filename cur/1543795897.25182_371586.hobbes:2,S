Can you farm it out, one set of patches to each of us?  Or do you want
to setup a seperate cvs tree based on the v4l code in 2.6.14.3, and
incrementally patch it as we each report its still ok, until it breaks
again?  I think I'd prefer the latter so we are all near the same
page even if it takes 3x longer to arrive at the answer.  How many
actual patches in terms of dependency groups are there?  I know, I
coulda went all week without asking that :(
