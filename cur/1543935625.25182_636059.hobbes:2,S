Hi Zach,
    Firstly, why not just specify an address for the return value and be done 
with it?  This infrastructure seems overkill, and you can always extend later 
if required.
Secondly, you really should allow integration with an eventfd so you don't 
make the posix AIO mistake of providing a poll-incompatible interface.
Finally, and probably most alarmingly, AFAICT randomly changing TID will break 
all threaded programs, which means this won't be fitted into existing code 
bases, making it YA niche Linux-only API 8(
Cheers,
Rusty.
