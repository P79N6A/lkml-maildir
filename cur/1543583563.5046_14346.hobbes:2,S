I have Duron on Via chipset.  Kernel is 2.4.2.  When I leave my computer in
work on during night, it freezes hard.  I have X running, so there are no
messages on console.  I suspect that maybe ACPI is doing that, so I am
going to disable it and try it again.  I will also shutdown Xserver before
I will be going home today, so I can see some kernel messages (if any) on
console.  I think that it is some 2.4.2 issue, because I don't remember
similar behaviour on earlier kernels.
