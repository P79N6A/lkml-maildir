I don't understand this statement.  Why would the maintanance cost of
providing speech output be any higher than serial or video or disk
filing or anything else for that matter?
I like the rest of your observations though and want to look over your
article in more depth and think about it.  On first glance though,
modifying vcsa0 to support select is pretty much the same as providing
an output hook the same as I've done in speakup already.
This has somewhat strayed from my original questions though. 'wink'
