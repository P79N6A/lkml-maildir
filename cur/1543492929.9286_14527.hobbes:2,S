Well, I think Ted freely exercises his right to ignore us. ;-)

Most compatible way is: inheritable=all, effective=all;
most paranoid way is: inheritable=none, effective=none;
I'd say go for compatible, but possibly cripple some binaries.  This
should be configurable, however.

Solved above.

The problem that setting inheritable bits is a non-priviledged operation
under the setuid0 scheme, and there is a LOT of power in the inheritable
bits.  You are left wide open to trojan binaries, but a paranoid sysadmin
(or distribution maintainer) can lock a system down _tight_ with the
stickybit/immutable solution.  _Without_ recompiling all the tools.
(assuming, that is, that you're making progress with your cap-setting
utility ;-)
There are worse problems, though; see my latest treatise to Pavel for a
much better named(8) example.  (you should have it in 2 minutes or less
;-)
cheers,
