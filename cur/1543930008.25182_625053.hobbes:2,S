Hello!
Excuse my bad english, I am no native speaker. And please CC me, as I am 
not subscribed!
I am running an amd64 system with a stable gentoo. Today I upgraded to 
the kernel 2.6.22 and noticed many programs to disappear.
I use a kde desktop (3.5.7) and when amarok or kmail crash, normaly 
a "kde-crash-manager" pops up (but that happend very rarely), but not 
with 2.6.22+. It happens often and without any messagebox.
kdesktop, xchat, kicker, konqueror crashed as well.
It happens more often under heavy load. But it can also happen when 
idle. Also I have the feeling that it happens more often on 2.6.23+ I 
might be wrong.
I tried 2.6.23 and the current 2.6.24-rc4, which all show this problem 
aswell!
What has changed in 2.6.21 -> 2.6.22 that could cause such things?
Or who can tell that?
Can I help? How? (I use linux for years and can code, but I never 
debugged anything as big as the kernel...)
Markus
PS: Sorry thats so late, but I normaly stay on the distros stable kernel 
and only try vanilla when something is wrong ;)
