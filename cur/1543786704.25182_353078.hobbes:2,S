Confirmed. :-(
This happens with gcc 4.0.1 release and 4.1-20050917 snapshot.
The sshd child process dies with following errors:
Sep 24 01:11:14 den sshd[568]: fatal: mm_send_fd: sendmsg(3): Invalid argument
Sep 24 01:11:14 den sshd[568]: syslogin_perform_logout: logout() returned an error
Sep 24 01:11:14 den sshd[571]: fatal: mm_receive_fd: recvmsg: expected received 1 got 0
At least this gives some clue where to seek...
Ivan.
