hm, indeed, the current code does this. In theory we should not need to 
add every lock to every held lock's dependency, because all the 
dependency-conflict discovery algorithms can walk the full graph. The 
"necessary minimum" would be to only add it to the previous non-trylock 
held lock's dependency list.
ok, i like your latest patch as-is - it's simpler than to complicate the 
current dependency logic. the 'distance' field is only added to the list 
entry structure, so while it increases that structure's size, it at 
least doesnt directly increase lock sizes.
