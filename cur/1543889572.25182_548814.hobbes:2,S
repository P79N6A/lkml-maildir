Or perhaps git-bisect to find the offending patch.
I don't recall seeing anything that looked to bad but there was a fair
amount of change needed to get the last bit of portability into the msi
code, so it is possible something slipped through.
Possibly someone changed the default enable or disable state?
....
Which reminds me.  Now that we have a reasonable list, we really need
to reduce pci_enable_msix:
- int pci_enable_msix(struct pci_dev* dev, struct msix_entry *entries, int nvec);
+ int pci_enable_msix(struct pci_dev* dev, int nvec);
And just have drivers that use more the one irq walk the list off of pci_dev
of all of the msi irqs.  I did a little review a while ago and only
0-(nvec -1) are allocated and the are always in order in entries so it
shouldn't be to bad to generate a patch for that case, and not having
to worry about out of order or holes in the irq allocator would be
good.
