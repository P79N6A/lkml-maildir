Ah, yep.

It is, however there would only be 2 calls, and one I think would
also have a constant 0 for "order".
Though yeah, it may be better split another way. For this patch,
it shouldn't matter because it is static and will only have one
callsite so should be inlined anyway.

No, that shouldn't be there though.

Hmm, where is the other callsite? (sorry I don't have a copy
of -mm handy so I'm just looking at 2.6).
