/dev/fb in principle is fine.

Block devices are not mmapable, so there is no issue here.

They _are_ valid physical addresses in every case.

We already do so.
Jamie, there are actually two sets of macros for doing phys/virt address
translation on Intel.  The __io_phys and __io_virt macros in
asm-i386/io.h use bitops to convert between the addressp spaces, but in
asm-i386/page.h, __va and __pa use only addition and subtraction.  All
the VM checks for page addresses use MAP_NR() and pte_page(), both of
which are coded using __va/__pa, so we can never confuse a valid
physical address with an IO region address in the PCI upper memory.

Actually, I'm not sure that ptrace is even defined for mmaps of such
devices, so I don't think there will be a problem here.  As you noticed,
the code 
	if (MAP_NR(page) >= max_mapnr)
		return 0;
in the ptrace functions will deal with this quite safely.  However, for
mmap()ed ISA-hole addresses, ptrace will just go ahead and do the memory
access anyway, which is inconsistent I agree, but it's not necessarily
_wrong_!

For now, yes.

Me too.  It gets worse: I really want to be able to do block device IO
anywhere in the first 4G of physical memory.  That suddenly requires
that bh->b_data must support virt_to_phys() operations correctly for any
physical memory.  Ultimately that is something we can deal with, but it
does complicate matters and reqquires us to live with temporary
virt/phys mappings for IOs in progress.
> Agreed 100%.  Your strategy is brilliant!  Avoid the general problem :-)
Heck yes, every time. :) Ultimately if we can do the dynamic mapping
issue right (and I've spoken to Linus about this, there _are_ ways we
can deal with this) then dma to/from framebuffer becomes possible.

vmalloc as a special case is one case which is completely out of the
scope of this project: we _always_ have a physical address to start off
with, as a that is what we get from the pte.  Whether it was vmalloced
or not in the first place, we always start this particular part of the
problem with a canonical physical address and the only problem is how do
we make sure that we can also deal with it as a virtual address which is
what bh->b_data needs.  (For things like programmed IO, we *must* have a
viable virtual address for the duration of the IO, but there's no need
to have that virtual address persist after the IO.)

Good luck!
