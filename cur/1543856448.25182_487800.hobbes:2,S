Subject: 2.6.19: ACPI reports AC not present after resume from STD

I started to notice it some time ago; I can't say exactly if this was not 
present in earlier versions because recently I switched from STR (which gave 
me no end of troubles) to STD. So I may have not seen it before.
Suspend to disk while on battery. Plug in AC, resume. ACPI continues to show 
AC adapter as not present:
{pts/0}% cat /proc/acpi/ac_adapter/ADP1/state
state:                   off-line
replugging AC correctly changes state to on-line.
The system is Toshiba Portege 4000; I am not sure which information may be 
required in this case so please tell what is needed (unfortunately I will be 
off next two weeks without access to this system).
regards
