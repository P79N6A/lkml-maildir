Yes, the "stuff" may be supposed to be stable. But the trees feeding it 
certainly are not. People are rebasing them etc, and it doesn't matter 
because I think linux-next starts largely from scratch next time around.

I do agree. And maybe I should have made it clear that I think it's worth 
it to me only if it then means that the merge window can shrink.
If I'd have both a 'next' branch _and_ a full 2-week merge window, there's 
no upside.
Btw, it wouldn't be another tree to test, since it would presumaby be what 
'linux-next' starts out from - so it would purely be something that 
doesn't have the constant re-merging of the more wild-and-crazy 
'linux-next' tree.
