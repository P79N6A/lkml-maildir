Still you need to obtain oops/panic dump, decode it and post here,
otherwise nobody can help. And other people seem to have troubles reproducing
this report.
You can obtain oops output using serial console.
Or you can modify linux/arch/i386/kernel/traps.c::show_trace() to stop
after printing first oops and write that down to the piece of paper.
