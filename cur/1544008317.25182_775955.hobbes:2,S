This fixes a few issues seen on MacBook Pros:

I've ported them to 2.6.27 to help with them being applied sooner.
I've tried to keep them as small as possible. I don't have the
ports for 2.6.28 though I think John will be sending them soon
through his pending-fixes branch.
These are already applied on wireless-testing.
