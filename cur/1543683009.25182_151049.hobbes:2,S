:-) not the point I was talking about, but , still :-)
 Anyway,  I hear you are going to court, y'know 10
months ago I would be in no doubt about verbally murdering
you, but after reading the diary where he says one 
particular type of scum of the universe can trade their 
photos as far as he's concerned. Eurrggh. I feel dirty 
inside for calling myself a "GPL FUNDAMETALIST" to him and
the community.
I believe in FOSS, just not his vision of FOSS. Euuggh.
This court case, do tell.
