Subject: APM hangs during boot w/out keyboard plugged in.

I have noticed that the APM initialization always hangs when I
try to boot my various machines w/out the keyboard plugged in.
This is true of many kernels, including the one shipped with RH 7.3.
For now, I have to re-compile the kernel w/out APM support.  Is
there some fundamental problem with using APM w/out a keyboard,
or can the code be fixed?
My motherboard is Intel EEA2, 815 chipset.  If more information
will help, please let me know and I'll provide it.
Thanks,
Ben
