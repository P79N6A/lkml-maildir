Caused by ide-mm-ide-add-ide-4drives-host-driver-take-3.patch.  Applying
that patch alone to current mainline causes the above error after i386
`make allmodconfig'.
Just exporting the symbol doesn't fix it, so something funny is going on.
probe_4drives should not be initialised to zero.
probe_4drives should not be declared extern in drivers/ide/ide.c - please
declare it in a header which is included by the definition site and by all
users.
