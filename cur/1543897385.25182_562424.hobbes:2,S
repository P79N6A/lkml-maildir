IMHO The number of conntracks checked in early_drop() have following restrictions:
- it should be not too low -- to decrease chances of transmission failures,
- it should be limited by some reasonable value -- to prevent long check delays.
Also I believe it makes sense to have it constant (how about NF_CT_EVICTION
name?) -- to have the same behaviour on various nodes. However I doubt strongly
that anybody will want to change this value. Do you think it is really required?
thank you,
