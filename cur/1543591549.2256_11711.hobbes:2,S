Please don't get stuck on that -- It wasn't the point ;-).
I pointed out KAME (and this seems to apply to IPv4 stack too) because it
would not add the same address twice.  The fact that it doesn't print out
an error message was just some wondering on the side; irrelevant from the
point of view discussed here (this duplicate error might have to special
cased in userland tools somehow though).
The command can be made print out the error message if that's what's
deemed important.
I guess BSD people have for some reason thought returning 0 on SIOCAIFADDR
for duplicates is ok.  Or perhaps it's a bug.  Investigating.

I fail to see what the other right ones (ones that will actually add
an address too) are.  But that's not important. :-)
