   RTFM (man recv) brought the response:
MSG_TRUNC
     Return the real length of the packet, even when  it  was  longer
     than the passed buffer. Only valid for packet sockets.
   So packet socket is special case here.
   Sorry for disturbing.
P.S. Wondering - is there any way to find a size of next queued 
datagram? SIOCINQ? cannot find its description - not listed in man 
ioctl_list - but implementation inside of ap_packet.c does exactly this.
