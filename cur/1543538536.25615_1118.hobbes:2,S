we have a lot of arrays which are declared as being NR_CPUS elements large.
this is clearly suboptimal on the majority of SMP machines which have
only 2 CPUs.  i therefore believe this should be a config option.  what
do you think to this patch?

(before, NR_CPUS = 32)

(after, NR_CPUS = 2)
I think having 50k back is worthwhile, don't you?
