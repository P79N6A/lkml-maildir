Well, it seems that Matthew has been faster than me :-) Yes, I got -ck
patches from kamikaze sources.

I meant the 23.9 patches that Greg KH posted some hours ago for
review. I guess I will find myself in a couple of days.
To answer your latest mail, again I don't have numbers but from my
point ov view:
23.1 < 23.1+ck < 23.8+cfs.24
where 23.1+ck is slightly better than vanilla 23.1 and 23.8+cfs.24 is
much better than 23.1+ck.
My workload is pretty standard, F8+kde+firefox+kmail+amsn, some kernel
compile and so on.
Regards,
Fabio
