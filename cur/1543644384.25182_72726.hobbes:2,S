Which could mean that they, NGPT, have slower thread allocation algorithms
for many reason. Some M:N systems will red zone protect a page of the thread
stack adding overhead to creation and deletion (FreeBSD'c -current does
this), the memory allocation algorithms might not be able to take advantage
of short term stack recycling and other things. It's not clear that these
benchmarks are meaningful without outlining the conditions that surround it.
Not to take the show away from you folks, but it's definitely something
that I immediately though about once I saw the graphs.
