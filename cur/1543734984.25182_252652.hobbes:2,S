Hey, you know how device nodes have a bit set, indicating that they're 
device nodes and not regular files?  Can a set of such properties be 
defined for reiser4 metadata properties?
Like a "metadata" bit so you can distinguish (if you wish) between 
regular files and metadata objects, and in addition an "archivable 
metadata" bit which indicates that the given piece of metadata is not 
automatically generated and should be archived during backup (some 
manually-generated metadata which does not need to be backed up will not 
have this bit set -- perhaps add another flag indicating that it's not 
automatic but unnecessary to archive).
