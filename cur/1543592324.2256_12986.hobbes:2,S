I'm running stock 2.4.4 on five PCs with these features: ServerWorks
III HE, 2x 933MHz, 4GB RAM, dual-channel sym53c896 (FAST-40 WIDE) SCSI
controller.  One PC has the new 181GB Seagate SCSI drive; another uses a
3ware RAID controller with 4x 40GB IDE (looks like a 160GB SCSI drive).
All is fine with slackware-current.
You might play with "nosmp" and "noapic" kernel params.  When building a
kernel, disable everything including SCSI: work your way up from IDE or
floppy root.  SMP failed on our systems until I dumped the slocket-based
CPUs for Slot 1.  (Still a mystery, that.)
