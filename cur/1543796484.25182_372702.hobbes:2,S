As I say, these aren't licensed for inclusion into the kernel, they bear
a (C) Copyright notice and "All rights reserved."

No, they aren't - at least not anywhere declared below include/ and thus
uncompilable with GCC4.

The reason would be convenience, or maintainer efficiency as the Camel
book ("Programming Perl") words it.
If not including the right header file (such as ioctl32.h on x86_64)
breaks the compile, I presume they are needed.
