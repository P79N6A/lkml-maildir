No comments on the code sorry. Instead I want to ask, could you please
find a different name? swsusp3 is going to make people think that it's
Suspend2 redesigned. Since there hasn't been a swsusp2 (so far as I
know), how about using that name instead? At least then we'll clearly
differentiate the two implementations and you won't confuse/irritate
users.
