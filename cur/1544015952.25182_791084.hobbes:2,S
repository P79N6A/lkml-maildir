Subject: [RFC][PATCH -mm 0/6] kprobes: Per-probe disabling support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Currently, kprobes can disable all probes at once, but can't disable it
individually (not unregister, just disable an kprobe, because unregistering
needs to wait for scheduler synchronization).
These patches introduce APIs for on-the-fly per-probe disabling and
re-enabling by dis-arming/re-arming its breakpoint instruction.
These patches can be applied on the latest -mm tree including my previous
bugfix patch (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/5/472
).
You can download a test of this feature from here:
