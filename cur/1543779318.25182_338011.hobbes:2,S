Good point, I'll try to remember that. It doesn't apply here though
except for lm78 I think, and maybe lm93 when it gets ported. That's not
the majority of users though, so I still believe uninlining is the
correct decision.

True, I wrote a patch doing this already:
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/lm-sensors/2005-July/013148.html
Just wait for Greg to pick it and it'll show in -mm.

That's right. Do you suggest that it should be kept inlined then?
Similar drivers may be written in the future, causing vid_to_reg to gain
users and possibly grow larger (to support more VRM/VRD standards), then
we'll certainly want to uninline it anyway - but I agree that this ain't
the case at the moment.
I'll change that patch to only uninline vid_from_reg and not vid_to_reg
if a majority prefers me to do so.
Thanks for your comments :)
