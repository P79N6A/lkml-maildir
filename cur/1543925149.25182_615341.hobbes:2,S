Sure.
So we need to do what you say: never return an error from sys_times() and
change glibc to not perform error-interpretation on sys_times() return
values and recommend that people bypass libc and go direct to the syscall
so they'll work correctly on older glibc.   Lovely.
I wonder what happens with things like F_GETOWN, shmat() and lseek(/dev/mem)
on x86 (things which use force_successful_syscall_return()).  According
to the comment in include/linux/ptrace.h, glibc should be special-casing
these.
