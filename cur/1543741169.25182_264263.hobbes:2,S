You need __attribute__((aligned(sizeof(void *))): see moduleparam.h.
The padding between structures is arch-dependent (x86-64 found out the
hard way when we changed kernel_param previously).  Not sure why you're
using a separate section here anyway.

Haven't read closely, but why is FLAG special?
I think your macros might be better off always having the range, which
would reduce the number of functions..  I like including the description
in the macros: that's an improvement.
I always disliked the _NAMED versions (if it's a good name for users,
it's usually a good name for the variable and vice versa), but you might
want to consider always having it if that's the common case.
Cheers,
Rusty.
