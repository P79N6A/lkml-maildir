Well, I could find more or less reasonable explanation of this behaviour - different VM policies of two OSes and 
strangely strong and persistent belief "Free RAM is a wasted RAM" among kernel devs. Free RAM is not a wasted RAM, its a memory waiting to be used ! 
Whenever it is needed by apps I'm launching or working with.

No. Fully loaded KDE session (without kdesktop and kwin, since I don't use first and using my own WM instead of second).
So almost all necessary libraries are hot and loaded, and all what's missing is a dozen of Window's and Pixmap's to allocate and two threads to 
handle events. And it takes seconds, not tens of a second, as in UltraEdit case
