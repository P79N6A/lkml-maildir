Hi,
  I used to shutdown my P4 machine based on ASUS P4C800E-Deluxe
with simple "init 0" command. That somehow broke between 2.6.12-rc6-git2
and 2.6.13-rc1. The machines makes the sound like shutdown but it
immediately turns the power on again. I used acpi and the kernel
configs should be almost identical in all cases, as I just recopy
previously used .config and run "make oldconfig".
  Any clues? I still happens even with 2.6.13-rc3-git2.
Please Cc: me in replies.
