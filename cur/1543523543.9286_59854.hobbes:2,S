So getting back to the original benchmark; I guess it would benefit from
a lock/unlock on the dataset around each of the tests to avoid each test
skewing the results of the next ie. the client should drop its cache
with the lock at the beginning of the seq block test and force it to
re-read from the server ?? (if not, i think this should be the desired
behaviour).
I don't currently have a test setup with a NFSv3 server so i can't try
this right now but cw and I will soon be performing some testing against
NetApp Filers (with hopefully more reliable locking than Slowlaris).
Can someone point me at the source for the latest nfs-tests.
cheers, ~mc
