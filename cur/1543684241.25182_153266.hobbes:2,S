Oh, sorry:) One problem is that TSCs may be enabled on i386. They crash
upon boot-up. While I sent the patch, I ranted about i486 optimized
libstdc++5 Debian is shipping, which (also, but in a different way)
break i386. A thread has started about the later issue. Maybe someone
should have switched subject, though...
