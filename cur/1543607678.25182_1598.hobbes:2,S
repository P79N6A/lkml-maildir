Looks like I'll get around to creating a CVS repository starting at the
last known code in a couple of days anyway...

Good luck.
BTW, Richard - the last one for tonight:
devfs_unregister() vs. get_vfs_inode().  The latter blocks, so devfs_lookup()
and devfs_d_revalidate() can give you a nasty surprise - entry gets
unregistered while we allocate the inode and there's no connection between
it and inode or dentry at that point.  Then we merrily get dentry/inode
tied to unregistered devfs_entry.  And that includes reference _to_ dentry.
Enjoy...
