I've looked over it and except for the i2o_scsi driver it looks sane.
Cosmetic fixups I'd like to see done befoee merging to mainline:
 - run the code through Lindent
 - stop the needless file renaming.  Splitting up i2o_core.c into multiple
   files is fine, but please don' rename the other drivers for the sake of
   it
Now to i2o_scsi:
 - the logic of "demand-allocating" Scsi_Hosts looks rather bad to me,
   life would be much simpler with a Scsi_Host per i2o device.
 - the slave_configure/i2o_scsi_probe_dev logical is quite horriblebut
   fortunately with the suggestion above it would just go away
 - the global list of hosts and wlaking it on exit is a very bad design,
   that's something the ->remove callback should do on per-device basis
 - the completely lack of SCSI EH in this driver scares me, does the firmware
   really handle all EH?
cosemtic stuff in here:
 - <asm/*.h> after <linux/*.h>.
 - please include scsi headers using <scsi/*.h> (after linux and asm headers)
 - please use the standard pr_Debug instead of DBG
 - please reorder the functions a little so you don't need forward-declarations
