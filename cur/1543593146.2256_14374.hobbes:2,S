Subject: 2.4.5-ac6 and 2.4.4-ac11 boot fails with APIC timer

The message on the screen 
calibrating APIC timer .....
.... CPU clock speed is 1395.7390MHz
... host bus clock speed is 0.0000 MHz
cpu: 0, clocks: 0, slic: 0
Then nothing.  I had to push the reset button at this point.
ACPI and APM were disabled from the kernel config.
This boot failure messages was obtained from 
Pentium4 board GB-450(?) from Intel, NVIDIA M64 video.
Sound Blaster 128 PCI.  Netgear PNIC fast ethernet....
  
The same kernel was able to boot up the other Pentium 4 board from 
Gigabyte flawlessly. So, it depends on the motherboard manufacturers.
Regards to all.
