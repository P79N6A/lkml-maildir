Well, the administrator has to explicitly enable open-by-inode on a per
filesystem basis (by creating .inode with a special attribute), and then
access is restricted according to the permission of .inode, so there are
no security holes unless you ask for them.
There was still no demand though, despite a huge thread a few weeks
earlier begging for the feature.
