I'm not saying that it was correct to drop the lock before checking for
boosting. I'm just saying that it won't miss a chain walk.  But we might
do two of them. I think I'll send my patch again that fixes this up a
little.  I'll make two patches: one for mainline, and one for -rt.
In the debug case, we really don't even need to grab the lock.
(see patch -- coming soon)
