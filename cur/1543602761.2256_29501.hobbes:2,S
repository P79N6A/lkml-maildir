Hi,
I have to have two kernel images 2.2.14 and 2.4.9 to boot from. I
applied the kdb patch for 2.4.9 kernel but could find that make
bzImage failed because the modutils I have is 2.3.10. I thought of
upgrading my modutils and downloaded modutils-2.4.9-1.i386.rpm. It failed
saying   
  only packages with major numbers <= 3 are supported by this version of
RPM
error: modutils-2.4.9-1.i386.rpm cannot be installed
Then I tried with modutils-2.4.0-1.i386.rpm which failed giving so many
messages like the following:
file /sbin/depmod from install of modutils-2.4.0-1 conflicts with file
from package modutils-2.3.9-6
file /sbin/genksyms from install of modutils-2.4.0-1 conflicts with file
from package modutils-2.3.9-6
file /sbin/insmod from install of modutils-2.4.0-1 conflicts with file
from package modutils-2.3.9-6
file /sbin/insmod.static from install of modutils-2.4.0-1 conflicts with
file from package modutils-2.3.9-6
file /sbin/modinfo from install of modutils-2.4.0-1 conflicts with file
from package modutils-2.3.9-6
.
.
.
Please help me arriving at a solution.
Thanks in advance,
Warm regards,
