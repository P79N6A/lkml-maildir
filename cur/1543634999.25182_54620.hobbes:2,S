Well there was this model I started before I got booted to unify the
transport layer to operate under the classic/standard CDB model.  However
this would require fixing the FS's (which are bit-buckets for data
archives, and no more than a filing cabinet with cool features),
exteneding block to do nothing but translate between FS <> STORAGE.
Next was to have asymetric transfer because disk drives reorder to their
desire, regardless what the meatballs in Linux think.  Linux could vastly
impove its position in storage if it did two simple things.
	1) 8K writes and 64K (or larger) reads.
	2) ONE maybe TWO passes on elevator operations.
Since this is falling on deaf ears in general, oh well.
Maybe you can carry the banner of sanity.

Great!
I have no problems with "driverfs".

I prefer what Col. Medberry told to be "Perfectly Lazy!"
"Son, DO IT ONCE and ONLY ONCE, as not to REPEAT THE SAME ERROR!!!!"
This comes after taking his course for the second time, and being ripped
out of the class rooom and being addressed in a very stern manner.
