ok. In this case, it does not give any broken reference.
But, then, why does make modules_install run depmod if we know (almost
certain) that it will give broken references?
But, I need some more help. I can't load any ACPI modules, getting a No
such device as answer. I don't have also a /proc/acpi directory.
Thanks for any help.
