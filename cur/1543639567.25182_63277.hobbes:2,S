Peace, sir - I was not criticising the way the list is run. However, you 
stated "they never make it to the list" and implied the spam problem was 
within the email account of the poster, which you just admitted was 
incorrect.
I *wasn't* suggesting the list be filtered more aggressively - I was 
saying that removing the spam from the list would require more 
aggressive (read: more prone to false positives) filtering. The cure 
would in many ways be worse than the disease (at least at it's current 
level).
Unfortunately, until they make a legal hunting season for spammers, we 
must all simply put up with it. I suggest forwarding all the spams over 
to Spamcop to attempt to shut the spammers down (just make sure you ding 
the spammer's servers and not LMKL's!)
