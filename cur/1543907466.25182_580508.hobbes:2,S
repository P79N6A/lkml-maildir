I don't like structure bloat, but I do like nice design. Overloading is
a necessary evil sometimes, though. Even today, there isn't enough room
to hold bi_rw and bi_flags in the same variable on 32-bit archs, so that
concern can be scratched. If you read bio.h, that much is obvious.
If you check up on the iommu virtual merging, you'll understand the
front and back size members. They may smell dubious to you, but please
take the time to understand why it looks the way it does.

Changing the number of bvecs is integral to how bio buildup current
works.

bi_idx is integral to partial io completions.

So show some concrete patches and examples, hand waving and assumptions
is just a waste of everyones time.

It's a trade off, otherwise you'd have to pass the block device around a
lot. And it's, again, a design issue. A bio contains destination
information, that means device/offset/size information. I'm all for
shaving structure bytes where it matters, but not for the sake of
sacrificing code stability or design. I consider struct bio quite lean
and have worked hard to keep it that way. In fact, iirc, the only
addition to struct bio since 2001 is the iommu front/back size members.
And I resisted those for quite a while.
