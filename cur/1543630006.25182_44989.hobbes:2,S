I've seen a much more serious problem which seems to be related to this:
I have AMD Athlon K7 650MHz, Via chipset, Voodoo5 5500AGP, MTTR enabled.
What is happening here is that when switching back from init 5 to init 3 for
instance, the system hangs completely and a blinking character appears in a
black screen. There's no other way other than to power cycle the system. It
seems to be a kernel panic.
Kernel version is 2.4.18, and it happens with or without DRM support, with and
without FB support. There's no way I can have this version of the kernel to work
here.
Thanks,

MTRR, of course (do you like 2D and even 3D hardware accelerated without 
MTRR?), FB, no, chipset is a AMD 750 (Irongate C4), using X 4.1.99.1 DRI CVS.
I am with the DRI devel team and saw it occasionally with XFree86 DRI CVS 
trunk and the latest mesa-4-0-branch. At that time I had FB enabled as I 
remember right.
The current DRI stuff is "only" missing the latest XFree86 4.2.0 release 2D 
code. Update is under way.
I can _NOT_ see it without FB and currently running 
2.4.18-pre7-J6-VM-23-preempt-lock.
