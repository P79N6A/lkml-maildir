Good to know.

I've now compiled 2.4.21 from kernel.org with skas3 from debian, as 
well as 2.4.21 with grsecurity (from grsecurity.net, with medium 
setting) and skas3, and tried uml again with the same sparse image 
multiple times under both. I haven't managed to lock the machine up 
to now even while installing quite some stuff, so maybe the problem 
is already solved. If not, I'll tell you when it happens again. (I 
think I'll run 2.4.21-grsec-skas3 for the near future now.)
Thanks for your help
Christian.
