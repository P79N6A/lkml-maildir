The controller can handle up to 128, but I artificially limited it to 120
for reasons I shouldn't discuss in public. :)
Each command is 548 bytes w/o scatter gather chaining. So 548 * 512 = 280576
bytes for the command list. We've tested using 1024 commands with several
Smart Array controllers and have not encountered issues. The reason for the
increase is performance. The busier you can keep the controller the better
it works.
