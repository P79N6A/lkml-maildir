The patch
[TCP]: Send ACKs each 2nd received segment
commit: 1ef9696c909060ccdae3ade245ca88692b49285b

reduced Volanomark benchmark throughput by 10%.  
This is because Volanomark sends 
short message (<100 bytes) on its TCP
connections.  This patch increases the number of ACKs 
traffic by 3.5 times.  
By adopting this patch, we assume that with
small segment, having short delay is important 
enough that we are willing to reduce bandwidth 
with more ACKs.  
Is there any real application out there
that this new behavior could be a concern?
