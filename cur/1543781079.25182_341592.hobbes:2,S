Subject: [patch 03/39] add swap cache mapping comment
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Add some more comments about page->mapping and swapper_space, explaining their
(historical and current) relationship. Such material can be extracted from the
old GIT history (which I used for reference), but having it in the source is
more useful.
