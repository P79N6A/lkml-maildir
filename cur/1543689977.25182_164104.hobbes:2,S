Usually I hack up the hangcheck-timer module to be more verbose to
verify monotonic_clock() works. Also Oracle has a hangcheck-delay module
you can use to hang the system for a defined length of time. You can
then check the delta between gettimeofday and monotonic_clock to verify
its working as it should.
