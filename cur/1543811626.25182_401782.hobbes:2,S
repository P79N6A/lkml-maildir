Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Allocating more than 4 MB memory for the GBE (SGI O2) framebuffer completely
breakfs gbefb support at the moment.  According to comments on #mipslinux,
more than 4 MB has never worked correctly in Linux.  Therefore, the default
should be 4 MB.
