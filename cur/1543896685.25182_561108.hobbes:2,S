Actually, I disagree with driver by driver ease of hunting down
regressions. Perhaps a regression is caused by having two different
drivers have their tasklets converted to work queues. Or where their
might be any case a tasklet is somehow related to another tasklet.
Switching all tasklets at once can pin point the problem rather quickly.
Then it's easy to find which driver was the culprit.
