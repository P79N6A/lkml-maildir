How so ? Why would it be more complicated to do the workaround in
drivers/pci/access.c macros instead and not touch all the wrappers ? It
would actually make a much smaller patch...

If we ever endup rescanning the bus segment, indeed... I'd rather play
safe, it's easy to move the blocking to the bus access functions and
have the BIST function use the low level bus callbacks directly.
