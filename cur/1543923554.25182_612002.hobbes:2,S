Subject: Huge performance regression in 2.6.23?

Have a look at slides 17, 18, and 19 of the presentation available at
http://people.freebsd.org/~kris/scaling/7.0
%20Preview.pdf . It shows a
huge drop in performance for both PostgreSQL and MySQL under 2.6.23.
The slides are light on details on the exact setup, but I find it hard
to believe that such a major regression would have gone unnoticed
during testing of CFS. Maybe someone (with the appropriate hardware,
which I lack) can try to reproduce the results?
Is it really that bad?
