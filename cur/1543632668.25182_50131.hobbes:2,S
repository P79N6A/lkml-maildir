Hi All,
Previously with kernel 2.4.3 the ps/2 mouse could actually be HOT
unplugged and when plugged back in would resume normal operation
immediately.
If  this is attempted with either kernel 2.4.8 or kernel 2.4.18 the
mouse remains frozen and will only resume normal operation if I switch
consoles and then switch back or restart X. 
Any comments/answers would be greatly appreciated...
Thanks
Enzo Daddario...
