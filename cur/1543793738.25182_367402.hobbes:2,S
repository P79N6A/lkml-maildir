'/' is special exactly the same way '.' is: one is shorthand for "current 
process' root", and the other is shorthand for "current process' cwd".
So if you mount over '/', it won't actually do what you think it does: 
because when you open "/", it will continue to open the _old_ "/". Exactly 
the same way that mounting over somebody's cwd won't do what you think it 
does - because the root and the cwd have been looked-up earlier and are 
cached with the process.
This is why we have "pivot_root()" and "chroot()", which can both be used 
to do what you want to do. You mount the new root somewhere else, and then 
you chroot (or pivot-root) to it. And THEN you do 'chdir("/")' to move the 
cwd into the new root too (and only at that point have you "lost" the old 
root - although you can actually get it back if you have some file 
descriptor open to it).
