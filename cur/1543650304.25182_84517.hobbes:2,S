I forgot to CC Pavel the last time. Elfcap probably truly was restrictive 
only. This is comparable to dropping capabilities very early in the suid root 
binaries themselves, and thus not a significant improvement.
We want to be able to also grant capabilities (not only restrict them), so we 
may have fewer suid root binaries.
