<Takes a closer look at the patches>  D'Oh! :)  Yeah, the -rc4 version I'm
looking at is like a dozen 1-3K patches setting up and cleaning up, and then
one monster 65K patch doing the clockevents conversion, then another 6 or 8
small ones.
Yeah, that one big patch really doesn't look separable to me.  But as I said,
I'm just a crash test dummy here. :)
Andrew - how do you feel about keeping this in the -mm tree until Linus,
Andi, Ingo, and Thomas get on the same page (which may be around the 2.6.24
merge window, by my guesstimate)?
