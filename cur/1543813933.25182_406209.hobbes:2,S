Stradis does not support my driver.   Please use
http://stradis.nathanlaredo.com/
  such as it is now and I'll update it
later.
Secondly, please confirm that the person reporting this bug actually
has the hardware since the driver *will* refuse to load without
hardware installed.
To my knowledge I am currently the only one of about 10 people using
this hardware under linux.
Thanks,
