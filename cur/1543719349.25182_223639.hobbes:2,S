Long term, when NIC hardware is more advanced, we'll want something that 
divides sockets/connections/etc. into per-CPU clusters...  something 
that's friendly to both SMP and NUMA+SMP configurations.
Or if enterprising companies get a clue, and open their NIC firmware, I 
bet we could do this now.
