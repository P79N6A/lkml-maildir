We have three runs, all with 2.6.23-rc3 plus the patches that Suresh
applied from 20070922.  The first run is with slab.  The second run is
with SLUB and the third run is SLUB plus the tuning parameters you
recommended.
I have a spreadsheet with Vtune data in it that was collected during
each of these test runs, so we can see which functions are the hottest.
I can grab that data and send it to you, if that's interesting.

I don't believe so.  Suresh?
I think for future tests, it would be easiest if you send me a git
reference.  That way we will all know precisely what is being tested.

As usual for these kinds of setups ... take a two-CPU machine, 64GB
of memory, half a dozen fibre channel adapters, about 3000 discs,
a commercial database, a team of experts for three months worth of
tuning ...
I don't know if anyone's tried to replicate a benchmark like this using
Postgres.  Would be nice if they have ...
