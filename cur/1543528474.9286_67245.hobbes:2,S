Subject: rarp support in 2.3.x?

I have a sudden need for a machine that can answer a RARP, but all of my
2.3.x kernels seem to lack /proc/net/rarp. I looked thru the config
options, but saw nothing about RARP in the latest kernels. Does 2.3.x have
RARP support, and if so, how do I enable it?
Thanks,
Jeff
