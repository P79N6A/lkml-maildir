Are you claiming that you will never see -1 and EAGAIN on a nonblocking
UDP socket with sendto?  If so, I'll bet you a kernel patch that you are not
correct (I get to write the patch and you include it :) )

If it makes it through sendto, where can it be dropped before it
hits the wire?  I doubt the socket buffers are anthing other than FIFO,
and the same goes for the ethernet/device queue.  Since we (can) know
at sendto whether or not the PDU was enqueued for transmit, it seems
trivial to notify user space of success/failure of the local network
stack, and I believe this is what is done.
Now granted, it can be dropped anywhere outside of the machine, but
I can see no good reason to drop it inside the machine.
