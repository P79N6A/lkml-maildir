My proposal was to unshare the page table on read fault, to avoid race.
I suppose you could, just for your current testing, use that technique
in swapout, to avoid the much more serious TLB issue that Linus has now
raised.  But don't do so without realizing that it is a very deadlocky
idea for swapout (making pages freeable) to need to allocate pages.
And it's not much use for swapout to skip them either, since the shared
page tables become valuable on the very large address spaces which we'd
want swapout to be hitting.
