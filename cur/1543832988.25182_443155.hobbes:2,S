I was testing on x86_64 and turned off the option in
arch/x86_64/Kconfig.debug. 
When the option is turned off, the following functions become undefined:
local_irq_disable()           
local_irq_enable()             
local_irq_save(flags)          
local_irq_restore(flags)       
safe_halt() 
local_save_flags()
irqs_disabled()
irqs_disabled_flags(flags)                   
It seems plausible that some users may want to avoid the overhead of
tracing IRQFLAGS by turning the option off.
Regards,
Tim Chen
