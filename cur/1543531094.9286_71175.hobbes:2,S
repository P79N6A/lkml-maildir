It *WILL* get ENOMEM, normally.
The only difference arises when:
* You are low on memory
* You "allocate" some memory via malloc(), but do NOT use it.
* You leave it a while, and more memory is used.
* THEN you use the memory you had malloc()ed earlier.
If you allocate and then use memory, you're fine. Either it succeeds
and you have memory, or it fails with ENOMEM.

Is there really any need? Unless you introduce a significant delay
between allocating and using the memory, you never see any difference.
Even then, you only experience problems if there is already a problem
on the system (being very low on memory). Even that only shows up if
your process is a "low priority" one.
IMO, people are just trying to invent problems that don't really exist
now. Overcommit works perfectly well. Yes, you do have problems if the
hardware is overloaded and all your swap space is used - but then, you
ALREADY have a problem!
