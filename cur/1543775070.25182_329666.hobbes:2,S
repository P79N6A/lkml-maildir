No, you seem to miss the point.  Git already does everything Mercurial
does, and does it pretty well too.  The _point_ was that if the big
"feature" of Mercurial is it's on disk format, Git is perfectly capable of
copying it at any point.   The on disk format just ISN'T CLOSE TO BEING
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING AT THE MOMENT.

Yes, so what's your point?  Mercurial is trying to solve a problem that is
already perfectly well handled for me by Git.   Therefore I have _zero_
motivation to direct my efforts elsewhere.
