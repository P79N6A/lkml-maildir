Oh yeah, another MCA cleanup to consider -- like EISA, there exists a
'MCA_bus' variable which is 0 or 1, depending on the absence or presence
of MCA bus on the current system.
When CONFIG_MCA is enabled, this should be variable like it currently is
[on x86].  When CONFIG_MCA==n, MCA_bus should be unconditionally defined
to zero.
Look at how 'EISA_bus' is handled in test11-pre5...
