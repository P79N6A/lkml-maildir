HELLO, this isnt a hypothetical!! The moment there's a xen_paravirt_ops, 
Linux has DE FACTO committed itself to the Xen ABI: whatever 
functionality the hypercall_page call table plus the int $0x82 interface 
offers.
THE MOMENT any of that goes upstream and ships in a distro it's going to 
be there forever! Try to change paravirt_ops or any core bit of Linux so 
that this ABI cannot be sanely supported: 'fix it, you broke Xen!'. It 
wont matter that paravirt_ops is 'internal' to Linux.
so trying to argue as if there was no ABI imposed on Linux by hiding the 
Xen ABI behind paravirt_ops, and whistling into the air as if nothing 
happened is misguided at best.
