Ok Linus already applied your patch. Even though it's a really 
bad fragile hack, not better than the old bug.
Petr are you double sure you really tested with
ab144f5ec64c42218a555ec1dbde6b60cf2982d6
already applied? I bet not -- it is the symptom exactly fixed by this patch
(although 
Linus, I would prefer if you reverted 
b8d3f2448b8f4ba24f301e23585547ba1acc1f04
again -- it should really not be needed with 
ab144f5ec64c42218a555ec1dbde6b60cf2982d6
And I really dislike Petr's patch because while it might work
today (I'm not 100% sure it actually works to only replace
2 bytes) if we change memcpy ever it'll likely cause strange 
problems again.
