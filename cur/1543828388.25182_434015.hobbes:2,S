If it isn't then you can't figure out the current CPU/node for a thread.
Anyways I think we're talking past each other. Your approach might
even work on ia64 (at least if you're willing to add a lot of cost
to the context switch). You presumably could implement vgetcpu()
internally with an approach like this (although with IA64's fast 
EPC calls it seems a bit pointless) 
It just won't work on x86.
