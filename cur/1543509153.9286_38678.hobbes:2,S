oh, ok, i see it.

i'm not sure wether this will ever be accepted into the main kernel -
__cli()/__sti()/etc. right now is heavily used and inlined (mostly via
spinlocks) and it's a single instruction. Maybe building a table of 'cli,
sti, popfl, pushfl' addresses into a special section can do the trick
without interfering with the 'normal' kernel? A single-instruction 'int 3'
could be patched into those places, or something like that.
