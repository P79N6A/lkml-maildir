Current German copyright law says things like that clauses that forbit 
to gather information about the ideas behind a program through normal 
program usage are void.
IANAL, and we are entering an area where you need a lawyer that reads 
both your licensing terms and the copyright law to tell exactly what is 
allowed and what isn't allowed.
My main point is:
There are countries that have laws that are different from US laws (yes,
there's a world outside the USA...). If I download software from your
server it is possible that my local law is the one that is valid for the
contract between us (independent of whether I pay for the software or
whether you give it for free) and my local laws might be different from
the jurisdiction in the USA.
