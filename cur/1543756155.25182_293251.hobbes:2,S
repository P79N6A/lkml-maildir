i suspect there may be some fundamental misunderstanding here. The
change to honor PT_GNU_STACK (on 64-bit) was added in April 2004 and
appeared in 2.6.6. The change to enforce the protection bits on x86 NX
CPUs (32-bit) was added in June 2004 and appeared in 2.6.8. I.e. it's
been part of the upstream kernel for more than half a year. Try it and
boot 2.6.8, you'll get NX protection. (I'm not sure about when it was
enabled for 32-bit emulation on the x64 kernel, you should be the one to
know that - but IIRC it was enabled prior 2.6.10.)
so i think you are on to the wrong victim :-)
