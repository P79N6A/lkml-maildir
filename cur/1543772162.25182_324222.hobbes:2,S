We have 2 boards in as production servers in Manchester now (we are 
based in North Wales, about an hour and a half drive, or an hour if I am 
driving) but I have 1 sitting on my workbench at work ready for the 
kill, I'll build that today and try and kill it.  I'll let you know what 
happens.
Regards
Andrew
