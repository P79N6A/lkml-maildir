One feature that appears to be missing is a key handle or key reference,
essentially a structure for manipulating a key with an additional 
permissions
mask and the ability to be both cloned and revoked.  A clone should have
the same permission mask as the parent, reducible, of course.  When a 
key
reference is revoked it also revokes all cloned references, and their 
clones,
etc.  I guess a clone should be made when passed across a UNIX pipe, as
well as when passed to a child process.  That way I can give some daemon
a key handle to do work for me, then revoke the daemon's handle only, 
not
all the other handles I may have, when I'm done with it.
Cheers,
