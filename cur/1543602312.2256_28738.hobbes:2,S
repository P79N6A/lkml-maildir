Right, and kqueue() can't even represent the 'level triggered' style --
or at least it isn't clear from the paper that it can!  True "level triggered"
would require that the kernel track readiness of the affected file descriptors.

Agreed.

Solaris /dev/poll is definitely level-triggered; see Poller_test.cc in
http://www.kegel.com/dkftpbench/dkftpbench-0.33.tar.gz,
 which verifies this.
Poller_devpoll.cc is a thin wrapper around /dev/poll, and it definitely exhibits
level-triggered behavior with both Solaris and Linux /dev/poll.
(I later extended Poller to support edge-triggered notifications from the OS,
and translate them to level-triggered notification for the user app. 
Poller_sigio.cc and Poller_sigfd.cc are somewhat fatter wrappers around O_ASYNC,
and achieve level-triggered behavior only with cooperation from the application,
which has to call clearReadiness(fd) when the OS returns EWOULDBLOCK!
Surely the OS could do that internally, eh?)
Java's Selector in JDK 1.4 will have level-triggered behavior, not
edge-triggered behavior, btw.
