It should be reasonably simple to remove this problem of stacked
drivers.
There really isn't any need for md and dm (or md and md or ..) to use
the stack and the same time.
The following patch, which I posted in November last year, arranges
that if generic_make_request is called recursively, then the instead
of doing anything, it just takes a copy of the 'bio', and deals with
it when the parent request finishes.
So it effectively converts the 'and' back to an 'or'.
It didn't get much of an enthusiastic response then.  Maybe it is time
to try again.  Anyone interested?
(I don't know if the patch still applies, but it should come close).
