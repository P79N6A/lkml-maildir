hi list,
can someone please explain to me who calibrate_delay works in
arch/ppc64/kernel/setup.c?
as i can see it calibrate.c is a global function defined in init/main.h.
arch/ppc64/kernel/setup.c sets a pointer to the address of this function
extern void (*calibrate_delay)(void); and assigns its own routine to that
pointer. - hmm, every time i tried to do similar things (by mistake :),
the program segfaulted on me.
- can someone please explain how this should work?
thanks,
	tm
