Really, i have never seen a _single_ mainstream app where the use of 
sched_yield() was the right choice.
Fortunately, the sched_yield() API is already one of the most rarely 
used scheduler functionalities, so it does not really matter. [ In my 
experience a Linux scheduler is stabilizing pretty well when the 
discussion shifts to yield behavior, because that shows that everything 
else is pretty much fine ;-) ]
But, because you assert it that it's risky to "criticise sched_yield() 
too much", you sure must know at least one real example where it's right 
to use it (and cite the line and code where it's used, with 
specificity)?
