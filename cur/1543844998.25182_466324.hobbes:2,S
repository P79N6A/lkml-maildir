I really want at least the first one to go in, as the new AVR32 port
would soon find itself without a serial driver otherwise. And it
doesn't make any actual changes for the CONFIG_ARM case, so it should
be quite safe. The last two are bugfixes which I believe make sense on
ARM as well, but that's also a reason why they should be more thoroughly
tested.
I can resend them as individual patches if it helps make it more clear
that they don't really depend on each other.
I have a AT91RM9200-EK board lying around, so I might be able to test
the patches on that as soon as I get the necessary cross compilers and
other tools set up.
