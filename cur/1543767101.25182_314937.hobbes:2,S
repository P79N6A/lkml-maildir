One way is to make the pagefault handler return a new vma that
contains the faulty address when such a scenario is encountered. The
normal pagefault mechanism will then apply by the time that address
gets accessed again since the address will now be valid. So a page
will be allocated. But I don't know how what should be changed  in the
kernel to enable this behavior.
