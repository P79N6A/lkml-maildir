I've been having problems that I see in a couple userspace utilities: w,
and who. they seem to not be reading the utmp file properly, or perhaps
some program is corrupting it (xterm?)  My specific problem is that I have
some users log in using ssh, and they do not show up using the commands w,
who, last.  There also seems to be a couple corrupted entries in my
/etc/utmp file as shown by last.   Has anyone experienced this or dos
anyone have any guidance for me?
Dave.
