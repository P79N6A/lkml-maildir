Is there a reason why not? Other than 'non-one have the time' etc that is...
I would _REALLY APRECIATE_ if someone took the time to write one...
I'm most liklely NOT up to it, I'm not that good a programmer (never done

If someone cared, I could even lend the mb/raid card to whomever wanted/had
the time to do it...
