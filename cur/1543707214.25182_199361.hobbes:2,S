Will run from now for a couple of weeks with CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR=n;
  I checked my logs and noticed my first hang happened with 2.6.2, but
  so far I only experienced the problem twice since Feb 6.
I just now noticed that in /var/log I have the full Oops traces
  (until I Alt-SysRq'd out of it), so I'm attaching them; would you
  please take a further look and confirm this is _only_ an ACPI-related
  issue ?
messages.gz is 2.6.3-rc3, messages.2.gz is 2.6.2 vanilla.

OK, thanks for the info, will do next time.
