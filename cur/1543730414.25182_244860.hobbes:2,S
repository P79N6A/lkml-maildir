It makes no difference to me whether we use ramfs or tmpfs (I'd favor
tmpfs myself); just trying to get Fedora rawhide working again with
SELinux, and it happens to be using udev with ramfs for reasons unknown
to me.  Whatever filesystem is used, udev has to be able to set the
security attribute on the device nodes in it, so that SELinux can
properly mediate access.  Using ext2 in the short term would likely
work, but is obviously not ideal long term, and having security
attribute support for tmpfs would be useful for other uses of tmpfs
(with SELinux) as well.  Likewise, if ramfs has any significant usage,
then it would be good if we could have security attribute support for it
so that it can be labeled and access controlled properly.
