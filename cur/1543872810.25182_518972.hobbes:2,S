Now I think you're getting carried away because of your expectations from the 
previous scheduler and its woefully unfair treatment towards interactive 
tasks. Look at how you're loading up your poor P4 even with HT. You throw 2 
cpu hogs only gently niced at it on top of your interactive tasks. If you're 
happy to nice them +5, why not more? And you know as well as anyone that the 
2nd logical core only gives you ~25% more cpu power overall so you're asking 
too much of it. Let's not even talk about how lovely this will (not) be once 
SMT nice gets killed off come 2.6.21 and nice does less if "buyer beware" you 
chose to enable HT in your own words.

See above. Your expectations of what you should be able to do are simply 
skewed. Find what cpu balance you loved in the old one (and I believe it 
wasn't that much more cpu in favour of X if I recall correctly) and simply 
change the nice setting on your lame encoder - since you're already setting 
one anyway.
We simply cannot continue arguing that we should dish out unfairness in any 
manner any more. It will always come back and bite us where we don't want it. 
We are getting good interactive response with a fair scheduler yet you seem 
intent on overloading it to find fault with it.
