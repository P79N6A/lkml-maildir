thanks for testing it out.
one immediate observation i have is that you used a 2msec granularity 
setting on CFS, but even that did not cause context-switching as high as 
SD's rr_interval==2 setting:

so SD context-switched twice as much and saturated the CPU fully, while 
under cfs-v6 there was 34% idle time left. That double context-switch 
rate and higher CPU utilization could easily result in you experiencing 
a 'smoother' desktop (and smoother video playback) on SD.
could you try to maximize the preemption ratio on CFS by using a 
sched_granularity_ns of 0? Does that result in a higher context-switch 
rate and in better CPU utilization? Thanks,
	Ingo
