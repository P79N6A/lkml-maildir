As usual with most of that crap about return values from
sysfs_create_file, I disagree. strongly.
Why would I prevent the framebuffer from initializing (and thus a
console to be displayed at all on many machines) just because for some
reason, I couldn't create a pair of EDID files in sysfs that are not
even very useful anymore ?
I have _plenty_ of cases where the failure to create sysfs files, while
annoying and maybe deserving a warning, certainly doesn't imply
completely preventing the driver from initializing. However, all the
patches I've seen so far to fix the new warnings do just that (make the
driver fail)
I'd really like to have some kind of macro or attribute or whatever I
can put on a function call to say that I'm purposefully ignoring the
error. Is there some gcc magic that can do that ?
Ben.
