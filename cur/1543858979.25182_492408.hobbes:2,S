I can't see how that's exactly a problem -- so long as the page does not
get reclaimed (it won't, because we have a ref on it) then all that matters
is that the page eventually gets marked dirty.

Right. But would it really matter whether they are currently mapped or
not, given that we agree it may become mapped at any point?
I think the problem Andrew identified is real.
The issue is the disconnect between the pte dirtiness and a filesystem
bringing buffers clean. But I disagree with his fix, because we don't
actually want to just throw out that pte dirtiness information: we're
just trying to get the PG_dirty bit into synch with what the buffers are
telling us, not actually clean or dirty anything, as such.
Can we clear the page dirty bit, then run set_page_dirty afterwards, if
any dirty ptes are found?
The other thing we might be able to do is to skip doing the
clear_page_dirty if the page is uptodate. This feels more hackish but it
might be faster?
