What a lot of code.  It looks very readable, although I haven't read it
yet.
What I'm missing is a general overview: what does the feature do?  Why
do we need it in the kernel?  What is the value?
I see mention of converting kgdb.  OK.  But are there plans to convert
anything else in-kernel to use this?
I see some exported-to-modules API for kernel developers to use (I
assume).  It would be appropriate to add an overview of that capability
in the [0/n] patch description.
Similarly I see something about "user breakpoints" but I'm not seeing
any description of what they are, nor how they are used, nor what value
they bring, etc.
IOW, we need the glossy sales brochure, please.
