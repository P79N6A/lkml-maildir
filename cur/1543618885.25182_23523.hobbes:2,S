Well, it's a fairly small optimisation, but it's easy.
I did a patch a while back:  
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/2.4/2.4.17-pre1/inline.patch
This is purely against core kernel files:

And it reduces the kernel image by 11 kbytes.  That's not much
RAM, but it's a lot of cache.  It's almost all hot-path stuff.

The first patch should be against Documentation/CodingStyle.
What are we trying to achieve here?  What are the guidelines
for when-to and when-to-not?  I'd say:
- If a function has a single call site and is static then it
  is always correct to inline.
- If a function is very small (20-30 bytes) then inlining
  is correct even if it has many call sites.
- If a function is less-small, and has only one or two
  *commonly called* call sites, then inlining is OK.
- If a function is a leaf function, then it is more inlinable
  than a function which makes another function call.
fs/inode.c:__sync_one() violates all the above quite
outrageously :)
