Good to know. Atleast we do not have a regression for 2.6.24 now.

With CPU_IDLE, the C-state policy is removed from acpi driver. Ideally
policy should have nothing to do with ACPI, as ACPI only provides the
C-state mechanisms. So, with CPU_IDLE, it is not easy to control this
variable through a acpi driver module at run time. Also, the latency
interface that was mentioned before is to serve the same purpose in a
more clear manner (based on the wakeup latency) instead of a C-state
number which may not mean much from the end user point of view.
I will look at why latency does not work on a single core system
soon(Was that with UP kernel or SMP kernel?). That way we will have a
proper cover for this with CPU_IDLE in future.
Thanks,
