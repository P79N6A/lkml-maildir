It fixes bugs, so I would say yes.

I nacked it mostly based on the changelog, which turned out to be
incorrect.  The substance of the change I think is OK, except that it
looks like stddef (according to the C standard - 4.1.5) , not
linux/types is the official way to get size_t.   I'll send a follow-up
patch to fix that.
I would hold this patch until after 2.6.19.
