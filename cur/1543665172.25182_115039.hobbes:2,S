The right fix is to delete ipconfig.c, it has been the right fix for a long
long time. There are initrd based bootp/dhcp setups that can also then mount
a root NFS partition and they do *not* need any kernel helper.
Indeed probably the biggest distro using nfs root (LTSP) doesn't use ipconfig
even on 2.4. 
DaveM can you just remove the thing. See 
http://www.ltsp.org
 for initrds that
don't need it in
