Yes, this is not possible.
But what possible is: we have the unbalanced put_pid(pid) which frees the
live pid. The next alloc_pid() gets the same memory, and initializes all
pid->tasks[] lists.
Now, if that pid was used as PIDTYPE_PGID/PIDTYPE_SID, the next detach_pid()
from this pgrp/sid sees that the pid is not used (all lists are hlist_empty),
frees this pid again, and the bug manifests itself this way.
	tiocspgrp:
		put_pid(real_tty->pgrp);
		// ------ WINDOW ------
		real_tty->pgrp = get_pid(pgrp);
When bash spawns the command, both parent and child do ioctl(TIOCSPGRP,child),
and it is possible that both do put_pid() on the same parent's pid.
Damn, when you know what the bug is, the test case is trivial:
	$ while true; do perl -e0; done
The kernel crashes.

and this is why this didn't happen before, I guess.

Ohhh... 7 (!!!) hours of hacking + some vodka did the trick.
(Kamalesh, I think you hit the same bug).
