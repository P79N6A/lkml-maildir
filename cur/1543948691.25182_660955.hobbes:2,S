Hello Sam,
> At first quick look it looked good and I have only two comments:
> 1) The variable should be named KBUILD_* to fit the general namespace used
I wanted to use the namespace EXTRA_* to continue the line of EXTRA_CFLAGS, 
etc. that were used when building modules. Is that OK? The other names sound 
odd to me: KBUILD_SYMBOLS or KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS. If you really do not like 
EXTRA_SYMBOLS, which one do you propose?
> 2) The new possibility should be documented in
> Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt
[PATCH 002/002] in this revised series updated scripts/Makefile.modpost to use 
this new feature of modpost, and documented the change as well. Please take a 
look at it:
