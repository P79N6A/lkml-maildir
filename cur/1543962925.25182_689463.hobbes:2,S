So you should send this trace to the busybox maintainer. It
obviously exhibits a small but easily fixable bug in the
program ; it should check whether the directory exists in
case of error. It seems it only checks for EEXIST.
What puzzles me is why you have this problem only with a new kernel.
I suspect that previous ones did report EEXIST and now we report
EROFS for an existing directory on an ro fs.
