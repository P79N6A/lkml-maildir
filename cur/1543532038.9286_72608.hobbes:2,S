On a whim, I went to my Linux box and tried to mount the old workstation.
IT WORKED!  (figured it was insecure since it had no root password).  At
least now I have the data backed up in the event of HD failure.  Other
hardwre, I'm probably screwed, but did notice several files like kconfig,
etc.
I did try to tar from the old box to the new one, but kept getting memory
overflow errors.  Went the other way (mounted the old box from the new, and
it worked).
I was able to get the program to run after duplicating the environment
variables, but...got an iBCS error right away:
HEre is the screen shot (can anyone help on this?):
         Copyright (c) 1991 U.S. AMADA Co., LTD.               version 2.11
                         FMS LINE CONTROL SYSTEM(P.CELL)
                                 Interactive UNIX
                     Loading the software,   please wait ...
iBCS: ioctl(3, 6b00[..k], 0xbffff9a6) unsupported
SYSTEM ERROR : ioctl(): Invalid argument
At this point, software goes back to a command prompt with black on black
text (can't see what you type, just the prompt with a cursor that doesn't
move--shell not locked up).
