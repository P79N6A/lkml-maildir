Will this DPS-like thread allow you to turn of such things as IO-apic
interrupts and reroute all interrupts to the processors that is not
running the real time thread?
I have _hacks_ that do this and it works quite nicely but it would be
nice
to find som more general API for this type of functionality. I do not
have 
the time to do that.
If your goal is at the "5 ms level" then interrupts may not matter to
you.
Is this the case?
