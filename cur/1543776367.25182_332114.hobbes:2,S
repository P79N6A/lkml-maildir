Rafael,
Thanks a lot for the quick reply and patch.  I have tested the patch tonight 
and things are looking good so far.  For the first time since I upgraded 
from my single core athlon 64 3500+ my cpu fan isn't a tornado.  Also, my 
CPU frequency isn't pegged at full throttle 24/7 (it's dropping down to 1000 
Mhz at idle as it should).  This is a good sign that your patch did fix the 
cpufreq driver in addition to the oopses I've been experiencing.
Thanks again for the patch, I'll let you know if the oopses reappear, but so 
far things are looking very good.
Jon
