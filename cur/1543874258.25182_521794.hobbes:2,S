Parallel system exists since very long. One is
flash->SW_or_HW_FTL->all_blkdev_stuff. The other is MTD->JFFS2. Think
about _why_ there are 2 of them. Hint - reliability, performance. Your
ranting basically says that only the first one makes sense. This is not
true.
We enhance the second branch, not the first, please, realize this. Both
branches have their user base, and have always had.

Matt, as I pointed in the first mail, flash != block device. In your
picture I see NAND->MTD raw block. So am I right that you assume that we
already have a decent FTL? The fact is that we do not.
Please, bear in mind that decent FTL is difficult and an FS on top of
FTL is slow, FTL hits performance considerably.
