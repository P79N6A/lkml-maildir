Side note: we already have all of that capability in the kernel:
sync_inode(blockdev_inode, wbc) will do an ascending-LBA write of the whole
blockdev.
It could be that as a quick diddle, running sync_inode() in
do-block-on-queue-congestion mode prior to doing the checkpoint would have
some benefit.

Yes, this is a distinct disadvantage of the whole per-address-space
writeback scheme - we're leaving IO scheduling optimisations on the floor,
especially wrt the blockdev inode, but probably also wrt regular-file
versus regular-file.  Even if one makes the request queue tremendously
huge, that won't help if there's dirty data close-by the disk head which
hasn't even been put into the queue yet.
