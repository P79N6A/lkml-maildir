Hi Steve,
On question I have (and I'm sorry, I haven't had time to look at your
patch to sort this out) is what happens if the user supplies a rather
serious I/O size, will you read ahead multiples of that, or what
happens?  Or, for that matter, how well will it perform?
I've heard about HPC applications for IRIX that issue a 2GB read.  :-)
