Well, what your logging facility tries to do (discriminated messages to
the console based on a mask) is extremely standard for drivers.  The way
you implement it is slightly, erm, less than desirable.  Having your own
version of sprintf in your driver is a definite no-no (why do you do
this?  You never seem actually to use the added formatting characters
like %E?).  But at least it doesn't do anything silly like try to ouput
to the serial port.
As far as the IP portion goes: layering and separation should really be
the order of the day---perhaps even to the point where you have a core
module with a scsi and an IP one that sit on top of it.

OK, I'll look forward to it.
