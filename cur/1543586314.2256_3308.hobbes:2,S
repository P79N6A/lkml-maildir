I'm betting that the latest ac (ac28?) is broken for you, too.
I had to revert the changes in 'ac' tulip -- they fixed Comet and 21041
cards, but broke some others.  sigh.
sigh.  More testing and debugging for Jeffro...  Comet (your chip, I
am guessing?) should be fixed ASAP, it's pretty easy.  21041 is not as
easy, but should be fixed quickly as well.
