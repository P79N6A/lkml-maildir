Professionalism is not a goal of this mailing list.  Good tight code is.
If you want to start a "professional-linux" mailing list, that's your
prerogative, but don't expect it to thrive because the real work goes on
here.

Nate Riffe                      The Master said: "I can talk all day to
inkblot@geocities.com           Yan Hui - he never raises any objection,
nriffe@shrike.deapul.edu        he looks stupid.  Yet, observe him when he
                                is on his own: his actions fully reflect
                                what he learned. Oh no, Hui is not
                                stupid!"
