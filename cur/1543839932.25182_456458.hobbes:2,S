Note that the PT_NOTEs segment is aliased to a part of one of the 
PT_LOADs - ie, it points into the data segment.  So making it -rwx would 
either be ignored, or also require putting the bits into a new PT_LOAD 
segment with 0 permissions, which is pretty pointless.  I made it R_E 
just so there was no permissions conflict, though the _E part could 
probably go.
