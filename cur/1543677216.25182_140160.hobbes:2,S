Well, d_lookup() isn't the only place that does a dget() without
holding dcache_lock. There are *many* places where dget() is
done without holding dcache_lock. That didn't seem to be a
requirement in the pre-RCU dcache model.

I don't think that would work in pre or post-RCU dcache.

rename, unlink etc. hold the per-dentry lock, so they are protected
against lockfree d_lookup().

Those routines hold the per-dentry lock as required and that protects
them from intruding lockfree d_lookup().
