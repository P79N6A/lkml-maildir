	One thing about 'sendfile' (and likely 'sendpath') is that
	current (hammered into running binaries -> unchangeable)
	syscalls support only up to 2GB files at 32 bit systems.
	Glibc 2.2(9) at RedHat  <sys/sendfile.h>:
#ifdef __USE_FILE_OFFSET64
# error "<sendfile.h> cannot be used with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64"
#endif
	I do admit that doing  sendfile()  on some extremely large
	file is unlikely, but still...
