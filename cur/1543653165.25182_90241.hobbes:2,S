Hi,
I understand that userland is 32-bit on Ultrasparc. I am trying to
compile user-mode-linux on Ultrasparc, and I guess I need to compile it
in 32-bit mode for it to run as a normal user-level process. UML make
use of certain files in asm-{base-arch} during compilation. Now, to
compile uml in 32-bit mode, I did not include any flags in
makefiles(like -m64, -mcpu=ultrasparc) that would include 64-bit
specific asm code.
My question is that, what difference does it make when I compile UML, in
a sparc32 shell, as compared to the above process without executing the
sparc32 shell. I understand that if compiled in sparc32 shell, it
recognizes the host-arch as "sparc" instead of "sparc64". But other than
that, does it make any other difference? I am also not sure, which is
the right method for compiling UML.
Any pointers will be appreciated.
