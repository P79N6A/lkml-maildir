Sounds like your SATA drive wasn't detected.
Please double-check that your config changes didn't disable it, but 
otherwise:

please specify _which_ SATA driver you are using so that Jeff & co can try 
to figure out what broke since 2.6.14.
Also, if you can pinpoint where it broke better, that probably helps 
(most sata changes were in -rc1, but there were some sata_mv and sata_sil4 
changes in in -rc2 too, so even just poinpointing it to either of those 
will help, although the daily builds might be even better).
