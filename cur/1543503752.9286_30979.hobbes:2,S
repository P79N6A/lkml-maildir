hm, you havent been following Linux development for too long, have you? 
Latency was always the primary optimization target, bandwith the second.

a severe misconception again. The Linux scheduler is optimized for
latency, nothing else.

nothing prevents you from lowering priority of non-interactive processes

the whole 'why sound skips' problem i think lacks one major necessery
component: information. Nobody really ever analyzed what the problem
really is/was. I do have a awe64 soundcard (which i almost never use), if
you (or anyone else) could point to a method to make sound-playback
produce bad quality, i'd be happy to analyze the problem. Is running
mpg123 enough to see the problem? What should i do to make sound skip?
