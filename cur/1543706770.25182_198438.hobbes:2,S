I think there is something wrong in the cable detection code. I've
tried chasing the bug a couple of weeks ago, but got distracted by
other work. On an AMD-768 based motherboard disks run in UDMA5 without
problem using linux-2.4.20, but on 2.4.24 (or anything with the new IDE
code), I can't get any further than UDMA2. At first glance it looks
like the 80-pin bits in the chipset registers aren't set. When I
manually force them, the driver has no problem running the disks in
UDMA5.
So far I've seen this behaviour with the following chipset:
  Bus  0, device   7, function  1:
    IDE interface: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] AMD-768 [Opus] IDE (rev 4).
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  
      I/O at 0xd800 [0xd80f].
But rumours are that even on Intel ICH2 it goes wrong (haven't
confirmed this myself).
FWIW, I'm using modular IDE, I still have to test it with IDE built
into the kernel.
