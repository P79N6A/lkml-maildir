Yes, I pointed Ben to patch files which lacked original rfc822 headers.
Sorry for causing trouble.
A related question: If a patch written by author A is forwarded via
e-mail by person B to git tree maintainer C, and C imports the mail with
git-am or git-applymbox --- will git catch the _last_ "From: " line
(hopefully listing the address of A) or the first "From: " line (which
contains the forwarding address of B) as author of the patch?
Similarly, will it care for the last or first "Subject: " line? (The
first line being the actual mail header, the last being a line in the
mail body or a line in a plain-text encoded attachment, that is.)
Thanks,
