I do more testing tomorrow, but what I remember is that,
I had no issues with suspend-to-ram.
(And take into account the fact that _all_ wakeup devices were enabled always,
the rc.local does that for me, and still I did quite a lot of suspends, but I
got the immediate resume, only and always after suspend to disk.

How :-)
(I will try to set up netconsole, and turn on acpi debugging, maybe this will help)
