The PPC Linux port will run on the 601 cpu just fine.  Linux runs on
the 7200 and 7500 powermacs which are 601-based, as well as various
old 601-based PReP workstations.  (SMP on the 601 is untested and may
not work, though if not it could be made to work without too much
trouble, if anyone cared. :)
MCA is a different story, there is no support for MCA in PPC/Linux.
