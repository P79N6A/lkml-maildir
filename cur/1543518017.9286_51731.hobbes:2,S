of course on different msau's (rings).

well, I read that the bridging code "make the lan's appear as if they were
1 big lan".
In yet another mini-howto I read: <<
A bridge should not have an IP address.  It CAN, but a plain bridge
     doesn't need one.
Once the system is back up, put the ethernet cards into promiscuous
     mode, so they will look at every packet that passes by its
     interface:

sounds interesting.
I'll have to give it a try when I get some time ... maybe after christmas.
thanks so far.
