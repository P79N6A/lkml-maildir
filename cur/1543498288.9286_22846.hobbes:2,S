I'm having some probs with this driver...
	- strange freezeups (suspect when setting channels but not sure)
	- channel changing does -not- work
	- I either get video -or- sound but not both...?
	- video is often corrupt... but not always
Any ideas?
kernel version 2.2.9 + international crypto;
binutils 2.9.1 + gcc-2.7.2.3
I -just- found the latest binutils and am building them now...
as the subject says a Zoltrix TV card (bttv) - I -can- give more info but
I'll have to dig it up so let me know.
Oh - I've tested with my own quick-built code + fbtv(with GGI/S3-ViRGE
driver) + several X proggies.
G'day, eh? :)
