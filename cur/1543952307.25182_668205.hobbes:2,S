The largest entry is for ehci_watchdog.  This timer won't run at all if
your EHCI controllers are allowed to autosuspend, which will happen
automatically if
	(1) You enable CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND, and
	(2) You have no high-speed USB devices attached, or the
	    ones that are attached have all been suspended.
On the other hand, if you were actively using some high-speed USB 
device during the test then it's understandable that there should be 
lots of timer interrupts as a result.
