Hi Linus,
can you add the patch below to your tree? This makes the
async_synchronize_full() a real absolute async barrier, rather than
just synchronizing the work scheduled upto the starting point.
It's a bit too much for some cases (so later on I might introduce the
softer synchronization again) but it solves some real problems
for people so this should go into -rc1 please...

Subject: [PATCH] async: make async_synchronize_full() more serializing
turns out that there are real problems with allowing async
tasks that are scheduled from async tasks to run after
the async_synchronize_full() returns.
This patch makes the _full more strict and a complete
synchronization. Later I might need to add back a lighter
form of synchronization for other uses.. but not right now.
