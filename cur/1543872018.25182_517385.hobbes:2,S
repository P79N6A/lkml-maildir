what are you talking about? A clockevents driver does not need to know 
about lapic details, at all. In terms of interrupt gates for the 
hypervisor to notify about clock events - use a virtual interrupt 
controller via genirq.
if you want to use hardwired hardware details as your API: DO IT WITHOUT 
MODIFYING LINUX. If you want anything more intelligent, something more 
'paravirtual' - WORK WITH US AND WORK WITH THE OTHER HYPERVISORS. So far 
all i've seen from you was excuses and stonewalling on every step! We 
told you about the need to do VMI-timer ontop of clockevents last year 
already! You resisted virtually EVERY SINGLE cleanup suggestion since 
your stuff got upstream and you ONLY acted when a change was force-fed 
to you. Just count the number of emails you wrote, versus the patches 
you did. And your code is barely 2 weeks in! That is unacceptable.
