Do you need to have the system save the framebuffer or can
X do that?  It would be unfortunate (time consuming)
to have to dig into swap to save device context.  That's
something we would like to avoid for ACPI, especially for
shallower sleep states that are intended to have little
resume latency.

Yes, with the multi-stage approach it is going to be painful
to get suspend right with any amount of system activity.
The only safe thing to do is to block software request queues,
drain hardware queues, and then do the sleep.  This becomes
considerably more complicated when we want to do suspend to
disk.

Right, I was hoping to be able to build a dependency tree from
the information provided to pm_register.  There would have to
be some intimate knowledge of PCI class information but it
seems doable.

Actually, the laptop wouldn't wake back up.  It would just stay
awake until the IDE request clears (presumably quickly) and the
system would then go to sleep.  I'm counting on most drivers
being a bit heavy handed and only handling vital requests after
the suspend request is issued.  Storage is really the only
area that comes to mind where we need to be very careful about
dropping requests.

When we take into account suspend to disk, it's even more
complicated.  We really need to
  1. Save the state of all devices to memory
  2. Dump the contents of memory out to disk
  3. Shutdown the storage driver(s)
  4. Put the system to sleep
This is unfortunate as storage drivers will presumably
need to change device state during step #3.  I think the
best we can do is save a snapshot of the system state
at some time before sleeping.

Right, suspend to RAM is a little easier that suspend to disk.
For ACPI, we would like to get both working.

Hmmm..  I'm not sure that is true.  My concern is with making
it easy to add power management support to drivers.  I'd
rather see complication go into the power management subsystem
where it only has to be done once rather than several hundred
times (once in each driver).
Here is how I see it working. Drivers call pm_access before
handling a new request.  Once pm_access returns, a driver can be
confident its device and bus are alive and ready to go.  I
don't think this is any more complicated than the request queue
blocking you are going to have to do to get your approach
working solidly.
Right? Or am I leaving out too many of the complicating details?
Thanks,
Andy
