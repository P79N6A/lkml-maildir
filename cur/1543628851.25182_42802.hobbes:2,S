The message means that the driver has registered a device
/dev/cpu/microcode with your kernel. Looking in /proc/misc you discover
that it is registered on minor 184 as a "misc" driver:
# modprobe microcode
# dmesg | tail -1
IA-32 Microcode Update Driver: v1.11 <tigran@veritas.com>
# cat /proc/misc
184 microcode
135 rtc
  1 psaux
134 apm_bios
There is nothing special about microcode driver in this respect -- it is
just like any other device driver. I.e. userspace application opens the
device node /dev/cpu/microcode and writes the microcode data to it and,
possibly, uses an ioctl to free the memory (if the user isn't interested
in keeping a copy of what has been applied to each cpu).
