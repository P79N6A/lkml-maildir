2.3.99pre1 i686-pc-linux-gnu
fcntl locks over NFS are not working.  They work with 2.2.12.
I have updated nfs-utils:
rpm -q nfs-utils
nfs-utils-0.1.6-1
Here is a test:
>mount rpppc2:/disk1 /tmp/mnt (loopback nfs mount)
>exim_lock /tmp/mnt/nbecker/.emacs
exim_lock: lock file successfully created
exim_lock: fcntl() failed: No locks available
exim_lock is a nice test program that comes with exim, which tries to
use fcntl to lock a file.
mount says:
rpppc2:/disk1 on /tmp/mnt type nfs (rw,addr=139.85.108.141)
There are no messages of interest in syslog.
