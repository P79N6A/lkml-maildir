That's the way I feel about drives, scsi/ide, etc.  I've been wondering with
the way the sd/st/sr drivers are.  Take this senerio (and assume hot
plugging of scsi devices is ok.)
You boot a machine and have 2 seperate scsi controllers (booting from ide is
assumed here).  You load drivers for the first card with 1 scsi disk (sda),
then you load drivers for the 2nd card with 1 scsi disk (sdb).  What happens
when you unload the drivers for scsi card #1, add a few more disks to the
chain and add the driver back in.  is it dynamic allocation where the first
disk on the chain is sda and the 2nd -> 4th are sdc -> sde?
This is where I see devfs coming in handy.
granted this isn't real world, but seriously, it's not something I wouldn't
consider doing on test machines with random scsi cards.  Devfs would really
help in hot plugging/rescanning of the scsibus.  I've always wondered, why
/dev/hdd is always secondary ide, slave, and sdd is not id3 on scsi0
As I said above, I think this has been drilled into the ground.
