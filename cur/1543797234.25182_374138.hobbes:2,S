That is as expected. The ftruncate() causes an immediate change in
length of the file on the server, and so reads will. In the case of
pwrite(), that is cached on the client until you fsync/close, and so the
server returns short reads.

Possibly not, but is this a common case that is worth optimising for?
Note that use of the standard write() syscall as opposed to mmap() will
not trigger this avalanche of page-ins.
