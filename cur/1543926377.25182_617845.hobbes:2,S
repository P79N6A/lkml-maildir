Just a follow-up to get this into the public record. I
discussed this with Mark privately and then did more
digging and established that in my particular case, the
problem was that the BIOS was hiding the p-state table
when a non-standard multiplier was used. So, I built
a custom DSDT that included the p-state table along
with an extra entry for my higher speed and now I've
happily got powernow support again.
