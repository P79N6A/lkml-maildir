I see.  So tanking the whole unit is better.  That way, if no one is
around, they won't even notice there is a problem (unless they check uptime
and/or read their logs carefully).  Step back for a moment and think of it
this way: is it the kernel's responsibility to decide what is best for the
user WRT user-space?  Sounds more like some operating systems we don't like
to emulate very much. ;)
Seriously, I agree that losing init is going to cause Big Grief, and is an
unrecoverable situation.  But perhaps the user wishes to preserve some
flexibility as to how to proceed in this dire situation (ie. an opportunity
to carry out some other task perhaps, before cycling).  I would suggest
that the behavior on loss of init be a toggleable /proc/sys/kernel switch.
