You're right - my mistake, it doesn't actually work on 2.4.8 either, I think
I was looking at the wrong thing when I thought it was actually working.
Is it worth considering (optionally) making /dev available to chroot()'ed
environments, or would that just defeat the whole purpose of chroot()?
Regards,
Steve.
