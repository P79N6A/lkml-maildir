The problem is that drives don't always cleanly report what they are in a 
simple to access format. All SCSI and ATAPI drives provide a model, 
manufacturer and serial number but usually the type of drive is buried within 
the Model field, and that has a lot of variations.
(I have personally seen CD/CDRW, CD-ROM, CD-RW, CDR, CDRW and DVD/CDROM)
Now what could be done is that said information could be exported to sysfs. 
Given the time I could probably manage the patch myself, but I'm currently 
overextended with the number of projects I have underway.
