In 2.6.24.2 under qemu (default config as well as my one) its still
dies at this point.
Unfortunately just reversing this patch dosen't help for me.
It seems that handle_IRQ_event is passed a null pointer for the action.

....
If i just avoid the probing by giving the correct irq  (23?) to the ne
driver things still look very odd...
eg:-
[17179569.908000] eth0: interrupt from stopped card
and when trying to mount the root fs
[17179574.636000] eth0: Interrupted while interrupts are masked!
isr=0x40 imr=0x0.
[17179574.640000] eth0: Interrupted while interrupts are masked!
isr=0x0 imr=0x0.
[17179574.644000] eth0: Interrupted while interrupts are masked!
isr=0x2 imr=0x0.
[17179574.648000] eth0: Interrupted while interrupts are masked!
isr=0x0 imr=0x0.
[17179574.652000] eth0: Interrupted while interrupts are masked!
isr=0x40 imr=0x0.
though it has mounted the root fs a few times with all that going on....
Is this all known issues or should I dig further?
