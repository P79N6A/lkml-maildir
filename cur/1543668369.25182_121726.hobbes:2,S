Yes, but no.
The corruption was at offset 52 decimal into struct ahc_linux_device. 
Without knowing your config it is hard for me to work out what you have at
that offset.   Rebuild your kernel with -g and do:
(gdb) p/d &(((struct ahc_linux_device *)0)->maxtags)
until you find which member is at offset 52.
Something incremented that field by one after it was freed.
