The sched-domains part of it (kernel/sched.c) is looking much
better now. Haven't had a really good look, but it is definitely
on the right track now. Well done.
As I said before, I am not expert on the cpusets side of things,
but as far as sched-domains partitioning goes, we really just
want the absolute minimum support in kernel/sched.c which can be
managed by a higher layer.
I'll review it in detail when it gets into -mm, but I don't expect
to find any major problems.
Thanks,
Nick
