Huh. So if I understand you properly, all timesources should have valid
read_fnct pointers that return the cycle value, however we'll still
preserve the type and mmio_ptr so fsyscall/vsyscall bits can use them
externally?
Hmm. I'm a little cautious, as I really want to make the vsyscall
gettimeofday and regular do_gettimeofday be a similar as possible to
avoid some of the bugs we've seen between different gettimeofday
implementations. However I'm not completely against the idea.
Christoph: Do you have any thoughts on this?

I'm a little busy with other things today, but I'll try to stir up a
discussion on this soon.
