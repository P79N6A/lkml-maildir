Patrick,
That's correct Plextor 40TW (ultraplex wide) is on ID3 and Plextor
plexwriter 32/10/12s is on ID4.Originally i had the IBM 36LZX drive at
ID6 (factory setting) but when using the aic7xxx_old driver it was
detected as /dev/sdb for some reason.I've changed the ID to 0 and it
became /dev/sda again...strange it is.
The Adaptec AHA-2940U2W card is set to boot from ID0 by default and it
has 2.57.2 BIOS (the latest i think).
I tried the latest 2.6.36 driver from Justin's site on kernel 2.4.21 and
it works great.I was unable to boot the 2.5 driver on 2.6.0-test2 it
game oops and i had to define blkdev.h in few places.
I will try your suggestions and report back.
Regards,
Paul B.
