Note that the pre6 version has a number of cases where it can really screw
up, don't even look at them too closely. I think I've fixed them all - it
was really simple, but there was a few things I hadn't originally thought
of. 
I'll make a pre7 once I've verified that the recursive semaphores work at
least to some degree, could you please take a look at that one?
