The underlined bit is absent on alpha version of the same function.
Note that this piece is bogus - if .action is NULL, we are already caught
by IRQ_INPROGRESS check.  So it's not exactly a bug, but considering
your arguments about exact same check slightly earlier in handle_irq()...
It's from cset1.437.22.19 by mingo; the same changeset had done unconditional
removal of IRQ_INPROGRESS, so there it made sense.  After the irq.c part
had been reverted (1.497.61.30 from you), i8259.c one should be killed
too, AFAICS...
