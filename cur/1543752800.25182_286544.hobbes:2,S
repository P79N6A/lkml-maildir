Hi Andrew,
after the cputime patches have hit BitKeeper, Uli had a look at them and
being Uli he found a bug. Actually three bugs but they are all in the
same function. The bugs are only relevant for an architecture that uses
account_steal_time which is currently s390 only.
blue skies,
  Martin.

[PATCH] cputime: fix account_steal_time.
From: Ulrich Weigand <uweigand@de.ibm.com>
From: Martin Schwidefsky <schwidefsky@de.ibm.com>
account_steal_time called for idle doesn't work correctly:
1) steal time while idle needs to be added to the system time of idle
   to get correct uptime numbers
3) if there is an i/o request outstanding the steal time should be
   added to iowait, even if the hypervisor scheduled another virtual
   cpu since we are still waiting for i/o.
2) steal time while idle without an i/o request outstanding has to
   be added to cpustat->idle and not to cpustat->system.
