Merge in some fixes for various corruption possibilities.
Drop some of the USB bits thanks to GregKH for going through those.
Some of the other things reported as broken in -dj1 (such as cpqarray
are still borked, I've not had chance to look at them yet).
As usual,..
Patch against 2.5.13 vanilla is available from:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/patches/2.5/

 before reporting
known bugs that are also in mainline.
