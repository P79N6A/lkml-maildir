Relatively few people. Mmm... ISDN is very important in some small
countries (like The Netherlands) and some larger (largest) countries (like 
Germany, France)) in Europe. Here in Europe the use of ISDN is very wide-
spread.  (I haven't checked which continent you are from..).
We DO benefit from the inclusion of the new ISDN patch which has not been
updated as far back as the stable 2.0.x series. Commercial companies like
SuSE which have a very big share in the Linux distribution market here
will probably also like to see the ISDN patch included. Ofcourse, due to
the fact that they're very close to the ISDN developpers they will
include it somehow in their upcoming releases (as they did with 2.2.x).
Just my 2 Euro-cents... ;)
