well, I strace'd by glibc 2.3.2 system /bin/true and it doesn't fork and 
doesn't open proc (first place the two straces differ).  Maybe your 
libraries have been hacked - seems the most likely to me - if this is 
happening for all programs than the libc is likely bad...
I can't understand what it is opening /proc/.../exe for and I don't 
understand what the ///////// in there is for (I think more than 2 
consecutive slashes are illegal in POSIX, not sure though, never use more 
than 2 :) )
On a side note /bin/true should take up somewhere like 10 bytes asm code - 
what the hell is that thing doing more than exit(1) for? it shouldn't open 
any files at all... what a bad design (and true --help and true --version 
don't work anyway... duh!)
perhaps try ltrace'ing /bin/true and see what that prints out?
Cheers,
MaZe.
