No, it does not. I know that my desktop PC reboots with a beep (and 
shows CPU information) from Linux - and it does not beep when rebooting 
from Windows 98.
Some BIOSes don't like when some devices are in some state. One example 
is my DTK FortisPro TOP-5A notebook - when rebooted from Linux, it hangs 
during POST - the fix was to add setpci <someting> to shutdown scripts 
to zero-out some cardbus controller registers.
