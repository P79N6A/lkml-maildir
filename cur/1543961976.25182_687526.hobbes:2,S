Pre-686 generations of x86 had chipset logic (KEN logic) that did the 
equivalent.  The only change in the 686 was moving this logic into the 
CPU itself.  So no, it didn't always mean "give me cached memory".

Sounds like it, or you should just do a global replace of ioremap() with 
ioremap_cache() for the Voyager drivers.
