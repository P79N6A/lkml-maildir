Why should he invalidate his stabilization work, and what's in need of 
fixing? The suspend in the kernel is great, but suspend2 includes both 
suspend and working resume code as well.

They apply, they work. What's not very good about that? Is this being 
blocked because of a spelling error, or did he mess up the indenting on 
"signed off by" or what? I realize you may have something other than the 
download version, but it's been years now.
I would like to see the working suspend (suspend2) in the kernel, and 
users wanting to debug the resume stuff currently in the kernel could 
get it under EXPERIMENTAL or some such.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
