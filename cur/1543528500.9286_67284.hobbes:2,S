It's much easier than that.  In the actual code you put a trapping
instruction, such as INT 70h (and, of course let the INT 70h handler
have a kernel-only ring bracket!) followed by a suitable number of
NOPs.  At trap time, this gets replaced by the suitable code before
IRET.
I doubt this is a good idea.
