Depending on libc-level trickery alone is no good if complete control of a
(possibly rogue) user program is required.  I think there still needs to be a
way (maybe a ptrace call?) to disable this.

I really hope the disable operation can go in the production kernel by
default.  Won't it just be a few lines of code?
