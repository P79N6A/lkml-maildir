Greg Kroah-Hartman will be picking up USB maintainer duties for the next
couple of weeks while I secure a new job and take a vacation.
If you have any USB patches, please send them to myself
(johannes@erdfelt.com), Greg (greg@kroah.com) and the Linux USB list if
you like (linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net).
Also, please note that jerdfelt@valinux.com doesn't work anymore. Please
do not send any emails to that address. A patch will be submitted soon
to fix all references in the kernel sources.
Thanks.
JE
