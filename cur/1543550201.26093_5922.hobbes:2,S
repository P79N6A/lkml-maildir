Right.

Just because.

Write good C++? Sure. Making porting from Windows to Linux easier? The
_least_ problem there is the language...

Right. _Very_ easy, just redesign the whole kernel to make it C++

Do a patch then! Or just fork off a C++-friendly Linux. It is a free
software project after all.

Ever heard what happened to the last effort for "drivers portable among
OSes using a generic interface"? Never heard of it? Was announced with much
brouhaha all over the place by $LIST_OF_MAYOR_UNIX_VENDORS, with the
intention of getting Linux hackers to write the stuff, or Linux users to
use their (binary only) modules. Was dead a month later, tops.

So you have hardware that supports C++, but not C. May I have a peek?
Sounds quite interesting...

Yep. That's why Linux is written in C, not i386 assembly.

Perhaps it increases the quality, by the second system effect. But then
again, Linux changes so much internally that this shouldn't make much of a
difference. And it is second (or even third) generation Unix anyway.
"Write your programs in $FANCY_NEW_LANGUAGE, and the quality automatically
goes way up" is pure marketing, no facts are involved.
If you want to choose the language you program in, go ahead. It is another
kettle of fish to get others to follow...

Because it isn't considered useful? Not worth the effort? Nobody has _done_
them, instead of just demanding that "others" do them?
