Why didn't I get a cc? Don't you love me any more? :'(

Could you add a note to MAINTAINERS as well?

Now this gets a bit confusing as we'll have two drivers for AT91. Any status report on merging these?
I can accept having two drivers (for a while at least), but the Kconfig help texts should explain the sordid details.

Why is this needed and is it perhaps something that can be moved to the MMC core?

This also looks like something that can be made general.

The debug output in the core should make this redundant.

I seem to recall that atmci couldn't currently handle transfers that weren't a multiple of four. Could you please add a check for this and fail the request with -EINVAL when that happens?

I hope "disable" here doesn't power down the card, as that would be incorrect.

The debug output here is already provided by the MMC core.

Not for driver poking. Hands off! :)
