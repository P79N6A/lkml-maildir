I think that the implementation of the secure TCP Sequence number
algorithm within the Linux kernel is flawed from ground on.
  I agree, using known data (port numbers, addresses) as "secret" data to
hash is false. Instead a good PRNG should be used everytime a sequence
number is needed, independent to any TCP data. Operating systems such as
OpenBSD do have cryptographical safe Sequence number generators, why
should Linux go the unsafe way ?
  But again, this advisory shows the general lack of security within the
old protocol suites. TCP Sequence numbers were never meant to be secure, a
32 bit number just cannot guarantee security at all. Later when the first
spoofing vulnerabilities were discovered the reasons of the sequence
number shifted from a "to order data" meaning to a "guarantee security"
meaning.
