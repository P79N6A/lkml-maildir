Hello Robert.
I have noticed that you are the writer of the hpet driver in linux.
I have been running the test tool provided in
linux/Documenration/hpet.txt  on an hp dl380. It runs for few seconds
and then the hpet timer clock stopped interrupting ( I looked at
/proc/interrupts). It happens faster when i increased the frequency
(starting from 1000 to 16000) . But is always happens.
Do you why ?
Thank you
