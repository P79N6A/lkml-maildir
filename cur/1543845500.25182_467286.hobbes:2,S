All that being said, device_for_each_child() is rather broken by design. 
It walks a list of items applying a function to them and bales out on
first-error.
There's no way in which the caller can know which items have been operated
on, nor which items have yet to be operated on, nor which item experienced
the failure.  Any caller which is serious about error recovery presumably
won't use it, unless the callback function happens to be something which
makes no state changes.
