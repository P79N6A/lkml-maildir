   BTW, I don't see anymore why pci domain info should be exposed to
   users at all. :-)
It allows the X server do what it wants to sort-of sanely.
It wants to be able to assign resources to video devices (even
implicit resources like VGA) and to do that properly it has to know
which PCI domain which devices are on and also the extent of the I/O
and MEM space on that domain.
