Yes, IIRC total apache = 60%, linux/apache = 33%

Sure are a lot of vulnerabilities there...

Define "stuffed down their throats".
We have samba servers here (Linux, Solaris, HPUX)
and while the windows clients stored infected files on
the samba fileservers, the servers themselves were
totally unaffected.

Yes, the command most likely would fail, since
it would run as the remote samba user, not
root.

Oh yes, vigilance is indeed due, but please let's
not lump all OSes together and pretend there
are no differences!

Shipped very unsecure, and most windows
programs would cease to operate or could
not be installed if the security measures
were implemented.

Ah yes, the checklist item - C2, as long as there is
no floppy disk, and no network interface - you install
either of those items, and no more C2 for windows.
The difference is, there are Unix systems that are
both secure, and fully functional.

OK, then.
We are not living in the same world.
