- It does not have to reclaim pagecache before suspend?
- It does not have to restore working set afterwards?
(You could do this to reduce image size, of course, but it can
be optional which is nice).

Also, don't just look at the time to do a simple suspend/resume cycle,
but the full cost of going from working state to working state (eg.
grep a kernel tree or two!).
Although the kexec details are out of my league, I really like
everything about the concept :) Nice work.
