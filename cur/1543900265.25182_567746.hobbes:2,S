Subject: [Patch RT] Fix CFS load balancing for RT tasks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

  Hi Ingo, all
  there seems to be something wrong with the way the CFS balances (or does not
balance) RT tasks. This was evidenced using the sched_football testcase
available from the RT wiki (
http://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/IBM_Test_Cases
)
which I modified and attached to this mail.
  The testcase starts a number of threads which fall into 3 categories:
	1 referee thread: SCHED_FIFO, RT prio 5
	ncpus defensive threads: SCHED_FIFO, RT prio 4
	ncpus offensive threads: SCHED_FIFO, RT prio 3
	(ncpus being the number of CPUs)
  To make a long story short, the defensive threads should end up distributed
among all CPUs, but that's not the case. For example, on a dual HT Xeon box,
after task migration stabilizes we have the following running on the different
CPUs:
  CPU 0: defense2
  CPU 1: referee offense2 offense3 offense4 defense3
  CPU 2: offense1
  CPU 3: defense1 defense4
which clearly show the imbalance between CPU 2 and CPU 3 where offense1
should not be allowed to run while the higher prio defense1 and defense4
are sharing the same CPU.
  The following patch fixes this by re-enabling the RT overload detection
for the CFS. It may not be the right solution, maybe it should be incorporated
into the other load balancing mechanisms. I did not digg deep enough yet
to make that call ;-)
  P.S. Thanks to Steven Rostedt for logdev which is proving invaluable in
       cases like this.
  Sébastien.
------------------
  The RT overload mechanism of the O(1) scheduler has not been activated
in the new CFS.
  This patch fixes that by inserting calls to inc_rt_tasks() and dec_rt_tasks()
in enqueue_task_rt() and dequeue_task_rt() respectively, which enables the
balance_rt_tasks() to be run in the rt_overload case.

 *
 * This is a scheduler test that uses a football analogy.
 * The premise is that we want to make sure that lower priority threads
 * (the offensive team) do not preempt higher priority threads (the
 * defensive team). The offense is trying to increment the balls position,
 * while the defense is trying to block that from happening.
 * And the ref (highest priority thread) will blow the wistle if the
 * ball moves. Finally, we have crazy fans (higer prority) that try to
 * distract the defense by occasionally running onto the field.
 *
 * Steps:
 * - Create a fixed number of offense threads (lower priority)
 * - Create a fixed number of defense threads (higher priority)
 * - Create a referee thread (highest priority)
 * - Once everyone is on the field, the offense thread increments the value of
 *   'the_ball' and yields. The defense thread tries to block the ball by never
 *   letting the offense players get the CPU (it just does a sched_yield)
 * - The refree threads wakes up regularly to check if the game is over :)
 * - In the end, if the value of 'the_ball' is >0, the test is considered to
 *   have failed.
 *
 * PS: I really don't like football that much, it just seemed to fit.
 *
 * 2006-03-16 Reduced verbosity, non binary failure reporting, removal of
 * crazy_fans thread, added game_length argument by Darren Hart.
