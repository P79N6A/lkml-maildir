I'm doing a similar thing, and there's been quite a lot of discussion
about patches of this sort.
You should read the threads with these titles that have been active for
the last few days :
"Suspected bug infilesystems (UFS,ADFS,BEFS,BFS,ReiserFS) related to sector_t being unsigned, advice requested"
"[PATCH] mm/slab.c remove impossible <0 check - size_t is not signed - patch is against 2.6.1-rc1-mm2"
"[PATCH] fs/fcntl.c - remove impossible <0 check in do_fcntl - arg is unsigned."
"[PATCH][RFC] variable size and signedness issues in ldt.c - potential problem?"
"Cleanup patches - comparison is always [true|false] + unsigned/signed compare, and similar issues"
A lot of good comments have been made by various people in those threads
about what type of patches are wanted and what type of patches are not
wanted. Also some comments on what kind of warnings not to bother with
(and why) have been made.
May I suggest that we maybe work together on this instead of duplicating
eachothers effort?
If you think that cooperating on this is a good idea, then feel free to
email me privately and let's talk about how to split the task between us.
