Hi,
Everyone seems to be speculating that this is caused by hardware. We have
6 identical machines and only 1 gives the same errors. I think (and i'm
pretty sure) that it's caused by reusing inodes or such (i'm not that
much into source). 
Try newfs'ing a disk. No matter how hard you try, the corruption will only
occure once the disk is 'used'. I've never seen this corruption on a new
disk, only on heavy used disks (i.e. news and mail data).
I'm currently checking 2.2.13 on our newsserver. I'm curious what will
happen tonight.
