Yeah, the way the truncate logic works right now truncate_whole_page() has
to remove the page from the inode list - otherwise truncate ends up
looping forever trying to truncate that page ;).
And there was a off-by-one error in my first untested version anyway: the
page_count() should be tested against "2", not "1", as the truncate logic
has elevated the count anyway (probably unnecessarily: once we get the
page lock nobody else can race to remove it from the page cache anyway, so
it's not as if it could go away).

No, I'll have to fix the truncate logic to allow for this all.
