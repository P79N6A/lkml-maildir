The effects of the bug are seen when using wodim (or cdrecord)

[patch snipped]
Thank you very much! The patch you supplied fixes the regression!
What do we need to do in order to get this patch applied in

To be honest, I was expecting a few replies from the appropriate

my regression report.
Nevertheless, thank you again for your attention/kindness.
