You use emacs.  I use vim.  My brother uses gedit.  My parents use
abiword.  Perhaps I should patch them all?  If that was so easy, why is
there cryptoloop/dm-crypt?

Actually, FS plugins currently cannot be modules.  They are currently
called "plugins" because they share some concepts with browser plugins,
and it sounds great in marketing.

Fine, let them be.  They are just very well structured code.  If you use
reiser4 and don't look in the source or the "metas" dir, they are
completely invisible to you.  I used the betas for months, and "metas"
never burned me.
