I do understand the benefits; I'm just dubious about the trade-off. If
we could _completely_ isolate our poor crack-addled driver authors from
the nasty number zero then perhaps I'd be less unimpressed, but as it is
they still have to wake up and smell the coffee when it comes to DMA
addresses _anyway_.
When I eventually get to go home, which will hopefully still be some
time this month, I'll give some more coherent thought to the idea of
just using a (struct irq_desc *) directly instead of an integer. Then
you get to use NULL as a special case still. It's not as if people
should be pulling 'raw' IRQ numbers out of a hat or even module
parameters these days, except for ISA drivers where they can do
something like isa_irq[7] for the parallel port etc. Although that kind
of stuff should be done through a platform_device anyway too these days.

It's not just "my laptop", I believe. It's the generic resource code,
which is happy to assign address zero since it's never been taught that
zero is now a special case. If we're not going to ask for the bug I
observed to be fixed -- if we're going to declare that driver authors
don't have to sober up and clean up their code -- then the resource code
should be modified accordingly.
