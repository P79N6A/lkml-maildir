They are only needed if the netfilter code is compiled in.  It just
seemed easier to keep the EXPORT_SYMBOL() close to the code that
defines the symbols.  If they are in netsyms then you need #ifdef
around them, netfilter has already handled that.  Either would work, it
is just my personal preference.
