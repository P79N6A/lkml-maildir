Er, which are you referring to here?  All of the choice statements are
done for clarity here. :)  Tho I was (and have been) pondering creating
arch/ppc/platforms/Config-[468]xx.in, which would rather nicely move all
of the options related to IBM 4xx processors to one file, Motorola 8xx
to another, and general PPC's nicely.
