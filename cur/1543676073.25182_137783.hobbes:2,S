   Yes, the "connection hangs/disappearances" where triggered by
   TCPAbortOnTimeout;
This is correct.
And it is the reason the connection dies silently.  Because
such write timeouts invoke tcp_done() which closes the connection
off silently.  This is correct behavior (sans the RTT bug David fixed
of course :)) because a host which hasn't responded at all from
so many repeated retransmission attempts isn't likely to get any
reset we send either :)
