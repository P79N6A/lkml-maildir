Sound good.
koi8-ru  extends koi8-u(RFC-2319) only by one Byelorussian letter.
But standartization of koi8-ru is not finished at this moment and these
encodings have different codes for some special symbols (AFAIK).
(See details on 
http://www.cad.ntu-kpi.kiev.ua/multiling/
and 
http://www.net.ua/KOI8-U/
 )
Maybe it would be better to separate supporting of koi8-u and koi8-ru in
kernel
to avoid problems in future?
