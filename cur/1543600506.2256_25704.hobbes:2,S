Sorry, but there's something still troubling me: is getting the following 
lines written to syslog normal upon booting after a "clean" shutdown or an 
indicator of a "dirty" shutdown?
>From syslog, referring to the last time I booted my machine:
reiserfs: checking transaction log (device 03:02) ...
Warning, log replay starting on readonly filesystem
reiserfs: replayed 16 transactions in 4 seconds
using r5 hash to sort names
ReiserFS version 3.6.25
VFS: Mounted root (reiserfs filesystem) readonly.
Some times the second and third lines are present, some times they aren't...
Should I worry if I don't get such messages whenever I boot? Or should I 
worry if I get those messages after (apparently) clean shutdown procedures?
Or shouldn't I worry at all? ;-)
