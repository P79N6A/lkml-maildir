Nothing. procfs is a union of 4 filesystems. Historical reasons ;-/
There are:
1) <pid>/* - per-process stuff. Procfs proper.
2) sys/ - what kernfs should be. I.e. fs interface for sysctl tree.
3) openpromfs - sparc only (?), AFAICS not actively maintained.
4) the rest - mostly information advertised by drivers + kcore + kmsg,
etc. Stuff that is not covered by sysctls (/dev/core is a symlink to
/proc/kcore. 'nuff said.)
They are different code-wise and ought to be separated. As soon as we'll
have working unionfs (or at least non-opaque mount) they *will* be
separated.

/proc/sys on Linux. It was stuffed into procfs because at that moment
procfs was the only virtual filesystem (and because they shared some
code).
