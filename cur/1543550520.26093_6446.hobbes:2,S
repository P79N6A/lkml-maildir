Hi Rik,
the shm swapping still kills the machine(8GB mem) the machine with
somthing like '__alloc_pages failed order 0'. 
When I do the same stresstest with mmaped file in ext2 the machine
runs fine but the processes do not do anything and vmstat/ps lock up
on these processes.
Greetings
		Christoph
