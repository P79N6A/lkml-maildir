The latter, unless you only want to protect against lame attackers :-)
Given the knowledge of the seed and the algorithm used, everything gets
fully deterministic for an attacker -> enthropy _zero_.
For example, let an attacker observe enough of your magic random data in
order to guess the algorithm, and a whole prng cycle will only contain as
many random bits as the number of bits of the seed value for this
attacker.
