Your statements are at once so arrogant, yet
so ignorant, it's hard to know where to even
begin - but you are quite mistaken on several
fronts; each new message from you reveals an
unbridgeable gulf, of which you do not even
seem aware.
I won't even begin to put together a point by
point correction, it's all too tedious, and it's
possible that you are here just to annoy and
wear down the developers anyway -
Please start sending in patches or discussing
kernel code, or even doing testing - if not, you
might wish to seek out a different forum for
your messages, where you might find a more
receptive audience - I'll refrain from making
specific suggestions at this time.
Best Regards,
Joe
