This interface exports both.

Good, because that's exactly what it does.  The arch is responsible for 
returning the legacy I/O port or legacy ISA memory base address given a 
pci_dev, which is used as a base for the page offset passed into mmap.  So 
e.g. mmap(..., 0xa0000) after doing ioctl(fd, PCIIOC_MMAP_IS_LEGACY_MEM, ...) 
would get you the VGA framebuffer for the device corresponding to 'fd'.

I think Dave Airlie did a version of the vga class driver, and the backend 
used for /proc/bus/pci could be used for both drivers.  I'm 
using /proc/bus/pci because it's available now and nearly good enough (i.e. 
this patch was all I needed to get going).
Anyway, I'll post another version with Bjorn's suggestion about the ioctl for 
choosing config or legacy I/O port read/writes, since it looks like the rest 
of your concerns are dealt with.
Thanks,
Jesse
