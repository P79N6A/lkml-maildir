I agree with both of you.
So, I think what happens is that PTRACE_KILL immediately after the PTRACE_CONT
works because there is no schedule in between, so the effect of PTRACE_KILL
is still seen by the (grand)child.
Once the grandchild has returned it has become immune for PTRACE_KILL.
Maybe there is no bug.
