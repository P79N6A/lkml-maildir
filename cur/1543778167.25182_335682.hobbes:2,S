We do have helper functions for human-time <-> jiffies (I keep adding
new ones :) ). But why not, instead of
	set_current_state(TASK_{,UN}INTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule_timeout(msecs_to_jiffies(some_constant_msecs));
just have an interface that allows
	schedule_timeout_msecs_{,un}interruptible(some_constant_msecs);
and push the jiffies conversion to common code?
There are some 300 or so users of schedule_timeout() in 2.6.12. I would
say about half are doing something along the lines of
	set_current_state(TASK_{,UN}INTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule_timeout(HZ/some_constant);
These would be replaced with
	schedule_timeout_msecs_{,un}interruptible(1000/some_constant);
I would *not* be changing the callers that do
	set_current_state(TASK_{,UN}INTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule_timeout(some_other_constant);
even though I think most of these are 2.4 remnants that don't need
short, e.g.  1 or 2 timer interrupt, sleeps, but actually can use a 10
or 20 millisecond (HZ=100, 1 or 2 jiffies) sleep.
This emphasizes another advantage of adding these new interfaces, the
delay requested does not change with HZ. Internally it does, certainly,
but the callers don't need to know that :)
Thanks,
Nish
