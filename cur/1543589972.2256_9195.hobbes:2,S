Hi,
 After removing my head from my a**, I revised the code that checks
the memory copy in the fast_page_copy routine.  The machine then
proceeded
not to stop at my panic, but I got my "normal" oopses.  I then had an
idea and removed all the prefetch instructions from the beginning of the
routine and tried the resultin kernel.  I now have no crashes.
What could this mean?
Here is a nother patch just so you can keep me honest if I
made another mistake:
-------------------------
diff -r ./arch/i386/lib/mmx.c ../lin2/linux/arch/i386/lib/mmx.c
149,150c149
<
< /*    __asm__ __volatile__ (

---
>               "3: movw $0x1AEB, 1b\n" /* jmp on 26 bytes */

---
>               "1: prefetch 320(%0)\n"                                         
-------------------------
  Please let me know if that makes sense :).
  Thank you,
   Seth
