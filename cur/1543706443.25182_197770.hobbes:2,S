Hi,
I have noticed two patches in Andrew Morton's tree, 2.6.3-rc1-mm1, that may be 
helpful for me and other nforce 2 users.  The two patches are
nforce-irq-setup-fix.patch
8259-timer-ack-fix.patch
I have compiled 2.6.3-rc2 with those two patches included.  Here is 
/proc/interrupts after reboot:
  0:    2347129  local-APIC-edge  timer
  1:       6604    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:       4458    IO-APIC-edge  serial
  7:          0    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
  8:          1    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 14:       4456    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:         17    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 20:     239364   IO-APIC-level  eth0, ohci_hcd
 21:          0   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd, NVidia nForce2
 22:          0   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
Timer is now local-APIC-edge instead of XT-PIC.  Seems to be better now.  I've 
checked to see if the problem with large clock time gain returned.  So far, it 
seems to be perfectly synced with my watch.
I don't know if local-APIC or IO-APIC are really any different with the timer.
If there is something I should know about the difference, someone please let
me know =)
Also, here's a snippet from dmesg:
enabled ExtINT on CPU#0
ESR value before enabling vector: 00000000

Thanks Ross and Maciej for the patches!
