This is not actually a bug, but it may be bad style (and thus could lead 
to a bug).  It is possible that something that uses IPMI can do some 
IPMI things before IPMI is initialized.  This can only happen during 
initialization, though.  Thus the check; once IPMI is initialized the 
function will never be called.
What's the opinion on this?  Should I just force IPMI users to 
initialize after IPMI?
Thanks,
