Then it sounds like the current wtmult/512 value for f_bsize is a bug.
Until such time as you get f_frsize going, just directly plugging
wsize into s_blocksize seems like a win.  Doesn't it?  At least, I don't
see the advantage of using wtmult.  (but could easily be missing it!)

ISTM that f_frsize is pretty useless for NFS.  Even if the server gives
you this value (as wtmult), what use besides conversion of tbytes/abytes
values does it have?
If you like, I can supply such a patch.
- s_blocksize, either
  . leave it as is (wtmult?wtmult:512)
  . set to wsize (ie, my first patch in this thread)
- statfs, both
  . report wtpref as f_bsize (already done if s_blocksize = wsize)
  . report (wtmult?wtmult:wtpref) as f_frsize
I think the second s_blocksize option is better because not only statfs()
but also stat() will use this value without any additional work.
