Well, fix emacs then. We definitely do not want 10000 settable knobs
that randomly break things. OTOH per-architecture different randomness
seems like good idea. And if Oracle breaks, fix it.

Which immediately makes your patch obsolete.

So fix Oracle. No need to invent serious infrastructure because Oracle
is broken.

No. Current situation is okay as is. It does not need to be
configurable, and it should not be.
Per-architecture ammount of randomness would be welcome, I
believe. That will force Oracle to fix their code, but that's okay,
and you can use disable PF_RANDOMIZE for Oracle in meantime.
