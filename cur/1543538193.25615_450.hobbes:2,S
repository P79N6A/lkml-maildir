Subject: why is inode->i_fop = rdwr_pipe_fops for anonymous pipes?

Hi guys,
Linux pipes are single-directional (as opposed to streams pipes,
bidirectional) right? Therefore, I understand why f1->f_op and f2->f_op
are set to different things. But why is inode->i_fop set to rdwr_pipe_fops
(or to anything at all) if there is no way to reach those via
inode->i_fop? The only thing one can do on pipe is
read/write/readv/writev/fcntl/ioctl and all these use file->f_op and not
inode->i_fop.
My guess is that this is due to Linux-specific hack whereby one could open
via /proc/<pid>/fd and so one needs inode->i_fop - is this true or not?
I intuitively ignore the weird things like "using ptrace(2) to do
miracles" or "opening files via /proc/<pid>/fd" which is why some things I
see in VFS code, sometimes, make no sense..
Regards,
Tigran
