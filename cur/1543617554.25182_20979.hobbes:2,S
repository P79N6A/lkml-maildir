Good point.  We surely wouldn't want to have an ELF interpreter
in kernel space.  That would be evil!  
	rm linux/fs/binfmt_elf.c
There, thats better, now userspace can load everything.  If we
can figure out how to get userspace loaded....
The kernel already knows how to load ELF files, and _has_ to do
that job to get userspace running anyways.   So why not use that
mechanism for modules?
