Jun,
I have to agree with what Andi says. It is in a slow path,
and we want to guard against user programs that could hit it.
Making it conditional doesn't buy a lot and would cause lots of
re-validation of the patch that we would like
to avoid so we can get this in to the 2.6 kernel ASAP. 
Don't worry! I am pretty certain the patch won't impact the 
performance of the 2.6 kernel on processors from other vendors ;-)
                       Thanks!
