It would make life easier for me if you could give each patch a nice
Subject: which describes what it does.  "cciss update [N of 6]" isn't very
meaningful.  And the name of the file into which you chose to place the
patch isn't a suitable description either.  Thanks.
All of these patches are generating rejects for me - eager beavers have
been patching your driver when you weren't looking.  Could you please redo
and reissue the patch series against -rc3?
Thanks.
