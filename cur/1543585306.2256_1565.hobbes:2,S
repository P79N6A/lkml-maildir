I made a couple of changes to it. Mainly:
 Made a Makefile
 increased the speed to 19200
 added a scrollbar
 a filter to get rid of some ansi characters.
If someone could add the code to use higher speeds and being able to
recall previous logs would make it more usefull.
The changed version can be obtained in:

Bugs: If your machine crashes while booting it will loose the tail of
the output, maybe because is not fast enough.
