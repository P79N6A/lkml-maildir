Running with this patch shows that /bin/bash has some unpleasant
O(n^2) performance issues with long argument lists.  I made a
1Mbyte file full of pathnames, then timed the execution of:
$ /bin/echo `cat megabyte` | wc
$ /bin/echo `cat megabyte megabyte` | wc
   etc. ...
System time was pretty much linear as the arglist grew
(and only got up to 0.144 seconds at 5Mbytes).
But user time ~= real time (in seconds) looks like:
1 5.318
2 18.871
3 40.620
4 70.819
5 108.911
Above 5Mbytes, I started seeing problems.  The line/word/char
counts from "wc" started being "0 0 0".  Not sure if this is
a problem in "wc" dealing with a single line >5MBytes, or some
other problem (possibly I was exceeding the per-process stack
limit which is only 8MB on that machine).
