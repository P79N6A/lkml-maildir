IIRC that I've told you this already. Here it is again: devfs=only
serves as a way of enforcing that the devfs entry->driver ops
connection is the only way of accessing a driver. It deliberately
breaks the fallback to major-table-lookup.
And it actually works now. It doesn't require massive 2.5 changes.
When I boot with devfs=only (which is always), my system still works.
