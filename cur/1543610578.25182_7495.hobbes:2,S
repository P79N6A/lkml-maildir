I'm running it 2.4.15-viro three systems here with no detectable problems.
One has been building lots of kernels, the other has been sitting rather
idle, except for the occasional redhat package build, and has been rebooted
a few times.  These are using a mixture of ext2 and NFS.
The last system is my firewall, which I don't expect to show any problems
with or without Al's fix, since it's running completely diskless (ie, NFS).
Naturally, they're all ARM boxen.
