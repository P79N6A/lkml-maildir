Such a fallacy along the lines of preventing root from shooting
himself in the foot exists now. It is impossible to edit a directory
itself.  Sure, you COULD hack your kernel to let you do that, but that's
not the point.
You can hack your kernel to allow all users full privileges. The idea is
to make the default kernel not insane.
