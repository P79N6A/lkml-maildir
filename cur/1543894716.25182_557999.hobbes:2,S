A daemon using inotify can "instantly"[1] detect this and label the file
properly if it shows up.

Same daemon can do the re-label.

Same daemon can do this.  And yes, it might take a ammount of time, but
the times that this happens in "real-life" on a "production" server is
quite small, if at all.

Again, same daemon can handle this logic.

SELinux already provides support for the whole mounted filesystem,
which, in real-life testing, seems to be quite sufficient.  Also, the
SELinux developers are working on some changes to make this a bit more
fine-grained.
See also Stephan's previous comments about NFSv3 client directories and
multiple views having the potential to cause a lot of havoc.

I don't think that is necessary at all, see above for why.

No, do the labeling in userspace with a daemon using inotify to handle
the changing of the files around.
Or has this whole idea of a daemon been disproved already with a
prototype somewhere that failed?  If not, a simple test app would not be
that hard to hack up.  Maybe I'll see if I can do it during the week of
June 24 :)
