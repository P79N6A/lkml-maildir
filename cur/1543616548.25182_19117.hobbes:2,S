Promiscuous mode means the network card will snag packets even if they
are not delivered to you.  Typically, only ethernet frames whose MAC
address matches you or broadcast are processed by the NIC.  Thus, your
NIC can read any and all packets on your network.
Are you sniffing your coworkers or something ? ;)
