I can't seem to get ACPI working correctly on my thinkpad. I've
installed the latest BIOS and embedded controller (so no longer have the
bad ECDT table problem). The result is very similar to what was reported
in 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=793
(let me know if my dmesg output is required). I tried turning on ACPI
debugging to get more info, but that locks my machine solid on boot and
the actual traces fly by before I can catch them. I've also tried the
relaxed parsing option, but that doesn't seem to make any difference.
Any ideas?
