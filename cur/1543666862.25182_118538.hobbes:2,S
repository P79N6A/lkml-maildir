Replying to myself for a followup,
I repeated the tests with 2.5.65-mm2 elevator=deadline and the situation
was similar to elevator=as.  Running dbench on ext3, the response to
desktop switches and window wiggles was improved over running dbench on
reiserfs, but typing in Evolution was subject to long delays with dbench
clients greater than 16.
I rebooted with 2.5.65-bk and ran dbench on ext3 again.  Everything was
going smoothly, excellent interactivity, and then with dbench 28, the
system froze.  No response to pings, no response to alt-sysrq-b (after
alt-sysrq-s).  A hard reset was required.  Nothing interesting logged.
Too bad.  Before it crashed, 2.5.65-bk was responding to typing in an
Evolution new message window better than -mm2.
I'll see if this is repeatable.
