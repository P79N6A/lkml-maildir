I am having trouble getting a 2.4 vmlinuz (bzImage) and initrd 
image onto a 1.44 floppy with all the new stuff.  Even a stipped 
down kernel compiled under 2.4 is @ 600K compressed, and I need 
about 800K for the initrd image.  I noticed that syslinux 
has some comments about not allowing initrd to span media.  
I there something more current that does or will allow me to
load the inittrd off a CD-ROM device (with vmlinuz and syslinux
on the floppy).   I know how to do this with GRUB (Grand 
Unified Boot Loader), but I want to use syslinux if possible. 
Thanks
Jeff
