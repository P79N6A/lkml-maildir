Not true, as Thomas points out. You are right for schedule_timeout(),
but that's why we introduced the _interruptible() and
_uninterruptible(). And there are reasons to use schedule_timeout_*()
instead of msleep() [not necessarily in this case, but in general],
specifically the presence of wait-queues.

I agree, and I recommend Daniel post to LKML to get some testing / see
if anyone actually uses this driver :)
