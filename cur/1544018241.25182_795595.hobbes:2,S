Typically we traverse lists of objects that are in the same slab cache.

If all objects are from the same page then you need not check
the NUMA locality of any object on that queue.

Right. That may be the case and its a similar tuning to what SLAB does.

Queing is sometimes good....

I am not sure that you understand the fine points of queuing in slub. I am
not a fundamentalist: Queues are good if used the right way and as you say
SLUB has "queues" designed in a particular fashion that solves issus that
we had with SLAB queues.
