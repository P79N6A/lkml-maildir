Seem sane.

Resistance shall be unflagging!

Sorry, but this little bit:
	while ((active = del_timer_sync(&new_timer) || 
		rq_time > get_jiffies_64()) &&
 	       !test_thread_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING));
 
 	if (abs_struct.list.next) {
 		spin_lock_irq(&nanosleep_abs_list_lock);
 		list_del(&abs_struct.list);
 		spin_unlock_irq(&nanosleep_abs_list_lock);
 	}
 	if (active) {
should be dragged out and mercifully shot.  Is it possible to make that while
loop a little clearer?
The abs_list exactly duplicates the kernel's existing waitqueue
functionality.  You can use prepare_to_wait()/finish_wait() there.
posix_timers_id, posix_clocks[], nanosleep_abs_list_lock and
nanosleep_abs_list should be static to posix-timers.c.
