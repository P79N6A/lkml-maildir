This is a new-machine.
The only other kernel it has seen is the distro-install-kernel ( 2.6.12
uni-processor (ubuntu-5.10) )  ( this kernel does not have a problem,
but it is not SMP )
I will try to find time to build 2.4.13 and 2.4.12 SMP kernels with the
~same config to see if they have the same problem. ( I presume I could
then attach these findings to the original bugzilla report? )
