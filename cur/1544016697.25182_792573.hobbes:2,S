Yes, eventually my intention was to bring all the sw counters up to that 
level, and allow system sampling via sw counter overflows. It's an 
arguably powerful concept.
I first wanted to see where they all go though, and how many of them we 
want, and how nuanced we want to make them.
Initially we can sample via __builtin_return_address(0) addresses, or 
pt_regs(current)->rip or so. Later on we could use save_stack_trace() 
perhaps, for a more vectored sample.
It would result in some rather cool kerneltop output: we could see a 
profile of which functions generate pagefaults, or which places generate 
context-switches, which places migrate a lot, etc.

So my approach was always to have a good guess about what the best usage 
pattern is, but also to not be rigid and ignore/exclude other usecases. 
The main principle of this subsystem is to be maximally useful in 
performance analysis, via modern and flexible abstractions. Pinning and 
exclusivity fits into that just fine - they are mechanism to improve the 
quality of the statistics.
