    I don't think that's the same. I am in dvorak, and haven't checked with
    defkeymap.map, but I'm talking about 
    Composekey    4   e  
    produces the byte value 0x4e.
Reread what I wrote above. You have that today.
No kernel changes required. Only, you press RightAlt instead of Compose.
     
    This raises another question; I don't suggest anyone document all the
    possible actions, but a synopsis of the major classes of actions, 0x000,
    0x100, 0x200 etc. that corresponds to the first table in dumpkeys -l is
    well worth doing methinxth. 
There is some information in the kbd.FAQ.
Long ago I wrote an article for Linux Journal.
The text can be found at 
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/Linux_keyboard_driver
That has the information you ask for, I think.
