Yes, that's possible.. In the current patch that is not a problem, because
the internal pid (aka kpid) == <vpid,containerid>  mangeled together.
So in those cases, the kernel would have to keep <pid, container_id>

An that's what the current patch does. Only thing is we did not rename
everything to kpid_t!

Can you point those out directly .. thanks..

Unless we do it .. we won't know for sure.....

So what we where thinking (and have experimented a bit with) is using
SPARSE for this. Didn't go too far, but is a potential.
Another possibility is to really introduce a pid_t (user perspective)
and a kpid_t (kernel pid <spaceid, pid>) type explicitely.
Then this would be solved.

See above (SPARSE or type strictness).
And yes, we internally discussed that, but the changes might be huge
to change all the occurences.
It would be good to know whether going this route will lead us to the
promise land or not.
