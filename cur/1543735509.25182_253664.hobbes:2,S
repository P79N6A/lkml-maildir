One issue here... When we discussed all of this with Keith, we wanted
a mecanism where the user can set the mode without "owning" the device.
Typically, with X: We don't want X itself to have to be the one setting
the mode, but rather set the mode and have X be notified properly before
and after it happens so it can "catch up".
This also involves dealing with all pending DRI clients too, that is they
have to be notified that the fb/vmem layout is changing, the pending
commands have to be completed, no more accepted, etc... until every DRI
"client" acked the change... That sort of thing.
