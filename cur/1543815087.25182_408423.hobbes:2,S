Subject: [PATCH 028/141] V4L/DVB (3430): Add new internal VIDIOC_INT commands
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/20/204

From: Hans Verkuil <hverkuil@xs4all.nl>
Date: 1138043470 -0200
- Add new internal VIDIOC_INT commands for setting the tuner mode,
for putting a chip into standby mode and to set/get the routing
of inputs/outputs of audio or video of a chip. These new commands
will replace older commands that are no longer up to the task.
