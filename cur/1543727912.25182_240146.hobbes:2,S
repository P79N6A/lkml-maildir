Subject: [PATCH] implement in-kernel keys & keyring management [try #4]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've updated my patch and test programs such that the concept of negative keys
is now supported. Negative keys are produced when request-key fails. They time
out after a short amount of time. They can be updated to real keys later.
