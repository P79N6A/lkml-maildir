Subject: [PATCH] SLIP: simplify sl_free_bufs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We can avoid assignments to the local variable 'tmp' and 
actually get rid of tmp alltogether in sl_free_bufs(). This patch does 
that.  This is safe since both kfree() and slhc_free() handles NULL 
pointers gracefully.
A related question: Why the use of NULLSLCOMPR & NULLSLSTATE instead of 
plain NULL for struct slcompress and its members?
They are defined as 
	#define NULLSLCOMPR     (struct slcompress *)0
	#define NULLSLSTATE     (struct cstate *)0
Seems to me that plain NULL might as well be used (and if so I have a few 
more potential cleanups in the queue).
