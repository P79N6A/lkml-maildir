sharable implies the interrupt handler checks to see if it actually
caused the interrupt ... which it doesnt at the moment ... presumably,
you're making it shared because another device will be using that
interrupt as well ... so when that other device gets an interrupt, how
do you know it's for that device and not PVR2 ?
