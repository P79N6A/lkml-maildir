Hello,
I have a minor patch against linux/Documentation/proc.txt.
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
This patch fixes a few "wrong" single quotes and one obvious typo.
In the text console less(1) displayed the wrong quotes as \222, xterm(1)
displayed them as black blocks, but in Emacs I couldn´t see an optical
difference. So before you tell me that the patch is stupid, look closely.
