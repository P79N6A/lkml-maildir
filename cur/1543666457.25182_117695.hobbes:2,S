Note you don't need any separate lines for this. If someone else is
transmitting a zero while you are also transmitting a zero, that's fine
and you didn't stomp on each other. If someone else is transmitting a
zero while you are transmitting a one, you won and a one was
transmitted, and they back off. If they transmit a one while you
transmit a zero, then they won :)
That's how CAN does it, IIRC. I don't believe it actually requires
synchronous clocks.
