That basically implies writing a small AF_FIELDBUS socket layer - it can
do just demux then the kernel will do select/poll/receive and other
grungy bits for you.

Demux is expected to be done the other side. So your socket layer rx would do
	if(skb->len < MINLEN || ....)
	{
		kfree_skb(skb);
		return 0;
	}
	sk=fieldbus_which_socket(skb);
	if(sk==NULL)
	{
		kfree...
		..
	}
	skb->sk=sk;
	if(sock_queue_rcv_skb(sk, skb)<0)
		kfree_skb(skb);
	return 0;
or similar.
