So, it seems it is probably not a driver problem.

I will suggest you to try sym driver 1.5c that also will fail to compile
on Alpha, as it is. But with the following define added in sym53c8xx.h, it
has been reported to work fine on an Alpha platform.
           #defined SCSI_NCR_PCI_MEM_NOT_SUPPORTED
I donnot remember which Linux version was successful, but your report let
me think that 2.2.7-ac2 will probably also fail with this driver version.

I dont know. And as long as I will not have an Alpha box to check the sym
and ncr drivers for Alpha, I will not be able to provide verified and
tested code for Alpha. Neither, I will be able to fix problems in the
kernel that may affect the drivers. Checking times the source code is
fine, but may fail sometimes.
