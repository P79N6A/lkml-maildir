I did that. I will send you the screenshot per private mail for not
cluttering up the mailing list.

It does not work that way. Both with 2.4.x and 2.6.0-test2, after
pressing sysrq-something you can only choose actions from the menu (i.
e. eventually reboot). Every key press is interpreted as magic key
menu selection, I do not even have to hold down alt+sysrq to choose
's'ync, 'b'oot and so on. There is no such thing as "e'x'it from this
menu". This may be regarded as another bug.
Syslog is not started at the point of root fs check, thus the dump is
not saved. I cannot call dmesg since after sysrq+t I'm stuck in the
emergency menu. So I booted normally (^C, ^D) and then did a sysrq+t,
rebooting and saving the previous syslog (boot messages and trace) in
kernmsg.txt. I do not think that it will be helpful since fsck has
finished at that time, but I attach it nevertheless.
Any other chance? I can also try other combinations (modular kernel,
no devfs, etc. but actually I like it the way it is).
Thanks!
Martin
