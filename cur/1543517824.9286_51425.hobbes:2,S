  "Don't ever run any executable that wasn't signed by trusted party, or
compiled from signed sources from trusted party, or installed
from trusted physical media". There is absolutely no excuse for having any
executables in casual exchange between untrusted parties.

  That means, you still have to configure your client to use compromised
proxy.

  What for? I can understand why someone may want to restrict the ability
of processes to do something with the network, but why check the
executable? If executable is owned by root, and it's changed, it's too
late to do anything -- whoever will check it, will probably be replaced
already unless something very complex (and annoying, and hard to
use, and reducing useful functionality such as PCMCIA support) like
securelevel will specifically prevent it. If user is running something,
what will it be checked against? Something owned by the same user and
therefore compromised at that time? Something not writable by that user,
and therefore impossible to maintain?

  Java only provides signatures to prevent most blatant trojans, and in
most cases it doesn't work well. Say, a user got something that has no
signature, and it needs some privileges to run -- what is he supposed to
do after he will see an error message?

  I see only one solution -- elimination of the need to run _anything_
that can possibly modify user's files and have unrestricted network access
in the casual exchange of information. If everything that runs is either
trusted (executable installed with proper checks of the package from
trusted source) or has its own sandbox (similar to what Java has for
applets, but implemented reliably) not shared with any other applications,
there will be no trojans, viruses, etc. If not, they will exist despite
whatever checks someone will try to use.
  In the particular case of spreadsheets, applications most prone to
mismatched security requirements of the environment and necessary
capabilities of "code" in them, I once proposed the model where
spreadsheet is distributed as a file with three sets of data -- original
data, code that when applies to original data produces working
spreadsheet, and data snapshot (complete or as a difference between
snapshot and original data) made by the application of code in the
spreadsheet to its original data in the sender's environment (or in the
environment on some server that is supposed to execute it if the
spreadsheet uses the model where environment is hosted on the remote
server).
  Then if user does not trust received spreadsheet as an application
(given that "code" in the spreadsheet needs some privileges to run -- this
is the case in most of spreadsheets now) he can just refuse to run it and
will see the data snapshot. Snapshot shows exactly what was the result of
running it in the sender's environment, data will still be accessible to
all operations, but actual code that produced it won't actually be
running, and user won't be able to do anything interactive except
operations that he will request explicitly or that are contained in the
trusted spreadsheet applications that he has already.
