Uhhh that is 20 years old... the original MULTICs had that.

And you think there have been no improvements? Think about windows... 10 years
to get NT4... and no real improvement there.

I was using a "VFS" layer way before Linux existed... Look at the old PDP-10
tops-10 system for a first draft (that I used, there may have been others).
When DEC released RSX11 all filesystems were under a form of virtual 
filesystem. Tapes, disks, and later networks and network filesystems.
Even microkernel systems existed in 1971.. though they weren't called that.
The RSX11 kernel only handled memory management and system calls. Everything
else was handed off to a privileged user mode task (disk drivers, file
systems, even some system calls).
The big innovation going on in linux is being able to learn from others
mistakes, then doing it better.
Propriatary software/IP doesn't let you do that, so you are stuck in a rut.
No improvements, no innovation.
