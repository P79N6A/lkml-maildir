Surely the same arguments also apply to character drivers as well?
From what you're saying, any use of these dynamic majors what so
ever is buggy.  So WTF do we have this facility in the kernel in
the first place?
What about dynamically assigning physical serial ports to ttyS
numbers?  I suggest that your argument also applies there as well.
Also to SCSI disks, where if you load SCSI driver modules in a
differnet order your disks all move about.  It's all the same
problem.
I suggest that someone submits a patch to rip out this apparantly
buggy and useless feature, or at least make the kernel print a
warning when its used such that people are aware of its dangerous
nature.
Of course, if you do rip out dynamic majors then you _will_ need
to have an assigned major number for PCMCIA driver services, and
probably a bunch of other stuff.
I also seem to remember hearing that we will only be using dynamically
assigned device numbers in the new expanded device space.
