Quite a lot of the 'xxx driver does not compile' bugs in bugzilla
may actually have been filed by people just doing coverage testing
to see what actually compiles and what doesn't.
This does unfortunatly make it harder to see at first glance which
drivers are actually still being used by users. The fact that quite
a few of them have no follow-ups does suggest however that no-one who
actually has the hardware cares enough to keep pushing to get things
fixed.  Moving a bunch of these under a CONFIG_BROKEN could be a useful
thing to seperate the wheat from the chaff.
