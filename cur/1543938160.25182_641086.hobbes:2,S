memory reclaim can occur when an inode lock is held,
causing i_iolock -> iprune_mutex to occur. This is quite
common.
During reclaim, while holding iprune_mutex, we lock a
different inode to complete the cleaning up of it,
resulting in iprune_mutex -> i_iolock.
At this point, lockdep gets upset and blats out a warning.
But, there's no problem here as it is always safe for us
to take the i_iolock in inode reclaim because it can never
be the same as the i_iolock that we've taken prior to memory
reclaim being entered. Therefore false positive.
Lockdep folk - we really need an annotation to prevent this false
positive from being reported because we are getting reports at
least once a week....
Cheers,
Dave.
