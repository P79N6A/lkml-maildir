Both noidletick and the per cpu gettimeofday change significantly
how timer interrupts work. I hope your generalizations will be still
compatible to that. It's a bit dangerous to generalize
before things have their final shape. 
Also vsyscalls make it all more difficult, because they don't map
very well to any kind of "timer drivers".

My point was basically that there is a lot of feature work going on
on x86-64 in this area, and that has priority over  any "cleanups" like this 
from my side. If it has settled again later maybe it can be generalized,
or maybe not. I will only do it if it truly makes the code cleaner in the end,
just lots of indirect pointers by itself isn't necessarily something
that does this.
