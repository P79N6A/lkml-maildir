Agreed, good work.

Should this be KERN_DEBUG instead of KERN_INFO?
I don't have the original mail because I got unsubscribed from the lists
a few days ago and didn't notice (have been having mail issues) so
pardon awkward cut & pastes

The size of this varies depending on architecture so the comment may be
misleading.  Maybe a comment like the following would be better?
/*
 * The portions of the mem_map used by SPARSEMEM are allocated in
 * batch and temporarily stored in this array. When sparse_init()
 * completes, the array is discarded
 */
I can see why you file-scoped it because its too large for the stack but
would it be better to allocate it from bootmem instead? It is
available by the time you need to use the array.
