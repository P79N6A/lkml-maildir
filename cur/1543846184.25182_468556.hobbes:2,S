Vadim, I think your patch is way too complex, and some changes are dubious.
You mix cleanups and changes in the same patch, making hard to match your 
patch description and its content.
Current scheme is to allocate power of two sizes, and not 'the smallest that 
accommodates the requested fd count'. This is for a good reason, because we 
don't want to call vmalloc()/vfree() each time a process opens 512 or 1024 
more files (x86_64 or ia32)
I  personally prefer that table grows by a two factor, especially when they 
are huge. Also, power of two sizes gives less vmalloc space fragmentation 
(might be a concern for some people that are LOWMEM tight and that reduce 
VMALLOC space to get more LOWMEM)
default __VMALLOC_RESERVE on i386 is 128Mo, but I have some servers where I 
use
vmalloc=16M just to give more LOWMEM for kernel use.

Whats the reason for moving this close_on_exec definition in struct fdtable ?
