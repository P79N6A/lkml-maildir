gears isn't an interactive task. Apart from using it as a background load to 
check for starvation because it loads up the cpu fully (which a gpu intensive 
but otherwise simple app like this should _not_ do) graphics card drivers and 
interrupts and so on, I wouldn't put much credence on gears as anything else. 
However I suspect that gears will still get a fair share of the cpu on RSDL 
which almost never happens on any other scheduler.
P.S. Al, please don't drop ccs from the original thread.
