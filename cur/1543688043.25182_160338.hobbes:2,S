How about combining something that's shared to all of the threads that
share a futex but not system wide (the mm?) with something simple that
won't change, like the page offset? Adding the mm into the mix wil
make collisions harder, and limiting the buckets to the number of
different futex offsets will make it simple and differentiate between
different futexes in the same mm.
