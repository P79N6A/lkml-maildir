This reason is as good as any. Remember, nobody has yet
actually run out of PID space. When that happens, then
there is a legitimate need to increase PID space.
I see you don't remember the original post. It argued in
favor of a large PID space "because the output of ps wouldn't
look nice otherwise"!!! (the poster wanted output sorted by
start time without using --sort=start to ask for it)

If one really NEEDS large numbers, then the limit must go.
I really don't want to see "ls -nal" spit out 10-digit numbers
unless I really have a billion users.
