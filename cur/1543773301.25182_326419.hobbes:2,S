Hrm, I expected ketchup to be able to handle that already.
Does it not?
So you can do the above by hand or you can use scripts/patch-kernel
in the kernel tree (but not in the 2.6.11 tree, just in the
2.6.12 tree or get it from here:
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/scripts/patch-kernel
 )
to do the reverse-patch and apply-patch.
However, patch-kernel won't download the 2.6.11.12 patch for you.
