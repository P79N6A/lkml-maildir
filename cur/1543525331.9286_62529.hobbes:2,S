Depending on how bad the breakage is, you could try producing a
devfs-for-reiserfs patch yourself. If you whip up a working patch, I'm
happy to plonk it onto my ftp site and announce it. I'll even work
with you to ease ongoing maintenance. It's been done before with the
RAID patches.
Step right up and volunteer! :-)
