Well i guess i couldn't explain what i really meant.
Thing is that i am trying to change kernel memory management 
specifically for one user process only.
i.e if kernel sees this process it will treat it in a different manner.
It won't let it to be swapped and give a very high priority to it.
I just wondered the possiblity of this.
Sorry for my poor english
