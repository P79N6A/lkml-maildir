Sorry about that...  I'm running the DSL-N distribution (based on
Knoppix), and having to transcribe the log messages by hand from the
console, i.e., there's no logfile to cut-and-paste from :-(.  I don't
have access to the machine except on weekdays, but I'll repeat the
crash first thing Monday morning and copy everything that's there...

I'll throw together a 2.6.21 kernel with this patch and give it a try.
Again, it will be at least Monday before you hear back from me on this.
Thanks!
