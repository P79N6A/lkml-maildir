Hi.
This patch series introduces and extends several userspace commands
used with netlink protocol.
Touch block command allows to write data and return sampled data to
the userspace.
Extended search and alarm seach commands to return list of slave
devices found during given search.
List masters command allows to send all registered master IDs to the
userspace.
Great thanks to Paul Alfille <paul.alfille@gmail.com> (owfs) who
tested this implementation and wrote w1-to-network daemon
http://sourceforge.net/projects/w1repeater/
 and 
Frederik Deweerdt <frederik.deweerdt@xprog.eu> and
Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com> for review.
