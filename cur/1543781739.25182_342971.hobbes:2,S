That command uses an implicit target of all (which is
bzImage + modules), and then SUBDIRS (or M) limits it to
the specified subdir., so it builds all modules in the
specified subdir.
As opposed to what I thought(?) the OP was asking about:
how to build one module only.
I think that we have nailed it enough now, yes?  :)
