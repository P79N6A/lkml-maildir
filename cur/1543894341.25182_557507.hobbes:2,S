You have a good point. It can be argued that contributions before
2.4.0-test8 were in fact GPLv2+, but anything after that point has
clearly been contributed as GPLv2 only.
So now we have a bunch of pre-2.4.0-test8 code that may possibly be v2+
and files that explicitly state v2+ in their boiler plate. However many
of these files may have had additional contributions from other authors
which (unless otherwise specified) were GPLv2-only. And because v2 and
v3 are incompatible, all those files with v2-only contributions will
become v2-only when version 3 is released. Of course it may be that all
those copyright owners do not mind re-releasing their copyrighted code
as v2+, but they will have to be contacted.
Several maintainers did pay attention to such details. I once submitted
a patch that among others touched reiserfs, and I promptly got a
friendly email from Hans asking me to sign off any rights he needed to
re-release the related code under a different license, so he made sure
the combined work wouldn't end up GPLv2 only.
