	Hi, Alan.
	The last kernel that it ran stably I think that was 2.4.19-pre10. I can 
reboot with this kernel, because the machine has hung again. One more reboot 
doesn't mind. :-(
	Could be a filesystem issue? The power line that the box is connected to 
fails a lot, and this machine has faced a lot of sudden shutdowns, so maybe 
reiserfs or ext3 is giving problems. But all the Debian archive is on a 
reiserfs partition, so we couldn't test if the problem is triggered by Apache 
or reiserfs in such way (or maybe I'm missing something?).
	I have oopses for -pre8, if you wish, from smbd, apache, sshd, etc.
	I can do nearly whatever you want in the machine. Now is nearly unusable.
	Thank you in advance,
		Ender.
