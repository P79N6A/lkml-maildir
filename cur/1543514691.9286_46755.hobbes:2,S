  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.2.8 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v130 (or later).
The main changes are:
- Added entries for /dev/sd, /dev/ide/hd and /dev/ide/cd hierarchies
- Added compatibility entries for floppy, RAMDISC, meta-device, SCSI
  disc, IDE disc and IDE CD-ROM drivers.
				Regards,
					Richard....
