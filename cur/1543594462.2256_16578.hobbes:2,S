Hi,
Sorry to disturb you all.
In the d_alloc() function in the vfs layer of the filesystem(2.2.14
kernel) we can see the following: 
        dentry->d_mounts = dentry;
        dentry->d_covers = dentry;
Why should both the above be assigned the values of dentry. Wher elase is
this used. Please help me with this information. 
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
sathish.j
