This leaves us in rather awkward position.  You see, there will be other
people whose machines don't work with suspend2 but which do work with
swsusp.  And other people who prefer swsusp for other reasons.
It'd help if we knew _why_ your machine doesn't work with swsusp so we can
fix it.  Futhermore it'd help if we knew specifically what you prefer about
suspend2 so we can understand what more needs to be done, and how we should
do it.
