I'm aware of that.  And I'm not opposed to the patch, but I'm opposed to
the notion that sys_bdflush as a whole has been useless for ages.  E.g.
noflushd[1] on 2.4 happily calls it every five seconds.  Count this as a
vote for rate limiting the message, for the benefit of folks switching
between 2.4 and 2.5.
Regards,
Daniel.
[1] Admittedly a bad example as it won't start on 2.5 anyway, but there
    might be similar codes around.
