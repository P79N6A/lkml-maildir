No USB or IEEE1394 on SBUS sparcs, so again no problem.
My point still holds, please put this enumeration into a truly generic
place that doesn't depend upon the actual implementation.
linux/dma-dir.h or even linux/device.h seem the most logical place (we
put the PCI ones in pci.h, and pci.h can be included cleanly even when
CONFIG_PCI is disabled, consider that), then we make
linux/dma-mapping.h and scsi/scsi_{cmnd,request}.h include this
linux/{device,dma-dir}.h file.
I don't see why this is a problem.  Either do this, or fix
asm-generic/dma-mapping.h which is not GENERIC because it
depends upon something SPECIFIC, specifically PCI.
