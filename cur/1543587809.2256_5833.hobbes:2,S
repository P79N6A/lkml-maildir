No. When you have resettable counters, you don't know if the counter
has wrapped or been reset. Either you have received 2345 packets in
between, or 2^32-102345. The difference is not negligible. ;-)
Unless you have a second counter which is incremented with every wrap
(_or_, perhaps better, with every reset) and can _not_ be reset
manually. This would be the date in your date/time example.
