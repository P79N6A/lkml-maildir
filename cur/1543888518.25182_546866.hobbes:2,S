Well, some of these are expected to be small & fast and work in all sort
of crazy circumstances, like udelay etc... I'd rather keep that on top
of the TB. Do we have actual examples where the TB freq is changing ?
Beside, on powerpc, we don't have another clock source that is as fast
to access and we have userland using the TB for gettimeofday via the
vdso, so I'd say bad idea ... Just keep the damn thing fixed frequency.

On a -sane- 970 box (which seems to be the case of all of them that
matter so far), the TB is sourced externally specifically for that
reason : to avoid it changing, The DEC is always derived the TB, so it's
not changing.
I don't have any plan to support somebody coming up with a HW design
broken enough to have a variable TB/DEC speed. If they do it, they
support it and they come up with patches that are acceptable (hint: that
will be hard !). Beside, it means the vDSO will not be useable for
gettimeofday on such a platform, which means it will have to fallback to
the syscall which is much slower.
Ben.
