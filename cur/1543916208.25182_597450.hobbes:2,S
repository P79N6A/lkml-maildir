The symptom is raid array that fails to complete a read request.
It has only been triggered by Yuri when he tried a dma-engine
configuration on his PPC platform with PAGE_SIZE=64K, this opens a large
window for the bug to hit.  The window is much smaller but not 100%
closed in the !dma-engine case, although no one else has hit it. 
2.6.22 returned reads from handle_stripe under the stripe lock so this
patch can be seen as 'reverting a botched micro-optimization' versus
'introducing a new way to handle reads'.
> Either way, we need to get #2 (at least) in to Linus.
#2 is less critical and cannot hit with any of the current drivers in
the kernel, so it is ok if this one misses 2.6.23.
