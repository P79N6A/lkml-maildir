You'd probably never want to do local traces for performance analysis.
It may be handy for other purposes, though.

It may sound strange, but formatting a large drive generates a huge
flood of block layer events from lots of io queued and merged. So it's
not a bad benchmark for this type of thing. And it's easy to test :-)

Thanks! Also note that you do not need to log every event, just register
a mask of interesting ones to decrease the output logging rate. We could
so with some better setup for that though, but at least you should be
able to filter out some unwanted events.

It's hard to make something that will suit everybody. Maintaining some
counters in sysfs is of course less expensive when your POV is cpu
cycles.
