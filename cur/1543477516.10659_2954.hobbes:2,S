Actually, I'm mounting everything 'nolock' by default (it's a default
option in my amd.conf).
Here's a question: I'm using this version of amd from am-utils:
    am-utils version 6.0 (build 1).
It looks like amd is mounting everthing using NFS version 2.  Any idea
why?  I was thinking this might be the default unless vers=3 is set.
