the patch does look like the right thing to do. There's nothing special 
about 'groups' versus 'tasks' in terms of scheduling. And most 
importantly, this solves the behavioral assymetry observed by Guillaume 
as well - which makes it an obvious-to-add regression fix. I've added 
your patch to the scheduler queue.
