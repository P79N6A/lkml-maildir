It was easy to do.

Yes it would be more scalable, but not as much as you would think.
The __down, __down_interruptible and __down_trylock code only gets
invoked when the semaphore is contended  for.

The __down_trylock() code can be called with another lock held.  The
spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_lock_irqrestore() interface is used to restore
the irq value for the lock that may already be held.

The code in the 2.5 tree was changed a while back to use the spinlock in
the wait_queue_head_t to replace the global semaphore spin lock.  So, this
has been "FIXED" in 2.5.
