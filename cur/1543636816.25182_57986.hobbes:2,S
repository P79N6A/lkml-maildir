Recommended reading: MIT's Magazin of Innovation Technology Review,
August 2002 issue, cover story: Why Software Is So Bad?
Next you might read: "... prominent, leading Linux kernel developer
publically labels users stupid instead of handling a special case
[that is ironically used as a workaround for one of the many system
software deficiencies] in what case the system software would hang
using a new feature the developer is about to add and admitted to be
paid for ..."
Adrian would deserve a thanks for spotting and reporting the issue
[and there *are* other use cases for the above mentioned swapoff -a,
some also to overcome kernel bugs].
With all respect, Alan, the critic isn't personal but reaction to a
trendy phenomenon that should be address if developers care about user
issues.
