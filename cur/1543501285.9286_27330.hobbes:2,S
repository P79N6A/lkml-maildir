Subject: [PATCH] /proc/net/dev_hwaddr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I attached a patch against 2.2.10 which adds "dev_hwaddr" to
/proc/net/. Here an example:
% cat /proc/net/dev_hwaddr 
lo 00:00:00:00:00:00
eth0 00:E0:7D:00:55:67
ippp0 -
I did this to avoid parsing ifconfig's output. I have a box which
has two network interfaces - one is connected to the part of
the intranet which is considered to be "trusted", the other is
considered "untrusted".
This two interfaces are configured differently concerning
ipchains-setup etc. I could have used the device name for
distinguishing the two interfaces, but it depends on the card
initialization order which one gets eth0 and which one is eth1.
So if I change one of the NICs one day, the two devices perhaps
swap their names and my scripts would the configure the wrong to
be trusted. That would really be fatal.
But of course I can distinguish both by the NIC hardware address.
But to get the hwaddr I would have to parse ifconfig's output.
I don't want to rely on that. So I did the patch so that I can
easily lookup which device name refers to which NIC hwaddr.
This could be also useful for those having need for a "unique
system identifier" - now they can easily lookup whether a
specific NIC hwaddr is present in the system.
[Note]
All hwaddr get formated like an (ethernet|tokenring|..) NIC's
hwaddr. If you want to have the right format for other NIC
types like ARCnet you have to reformat it. But I consider
this reformating not to be a kernel job. Instead this should
be done in userland.
[Disclaimer]
I never did any kernel patch before and I don't claim to have
superb kernel knowledge. If I did something braindead, tell me.
But if this patch is considered useful, I would be glad if this
gets into the official kernel source.
