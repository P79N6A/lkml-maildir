Well, it's not "ideal" but it will do for 2.6 to use this patch.  If you
look at the tty core, it's the same way that currently works.
Ideally in 2.7 I'd like to convert to have all fb drivers create the
fb_info structure dynamically, but that's much to big of a change to do
this late in the 2.6 development cycle.
