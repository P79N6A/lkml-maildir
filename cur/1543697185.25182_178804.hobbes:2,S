I tried this and it is getting to be a whole nasty mess can of worms:
You can't link the lib objects all in, because they can be overridden by
the arch dependent lib.a (we rely on link order to permit this).  For
instance on x86, dump_stack and bust_spinlocks give duplicate symbols.
If we have to add processing logic to work out what symbols are in the
arch lib.a, we might as well go the whole hog and try to work out what
is missing from the kernel and compile that alone as a module.
