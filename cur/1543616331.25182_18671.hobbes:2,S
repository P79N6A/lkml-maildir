I wouldn't change it.  In fact, Linux allows _any_ character except a NULL in a
filename, although POSIX doesn't.  (Well, I wouldn't use a '/' in a filename
even if I escaped it out the wazoo!)

The kernel stack is really small and doesn't grow, so a buffer allocated on the
stack could cause "load-dependent instability".  Using a "vmalloc" and a "vfree"
is fast, cheap and easy.
