It is an interesting idea but there appears to be following hard issues 
(some of which you have already listed) i am not able to see how we can 
overcome them
1) We are going to have a duplicate of the whole function which means 
any significant changes in the original function needs to be done on the 
copy as well, you think maintainers would like this double work idea.
2) Inline functions is often the place where we need a fast path to 
overcome the current kprobes overhead.
3) As you said it is not trivial across all the platforms to do a switch 
to the instrumented function from the original during the execution.  
This problem is similar to the issue we are dealing with djprobes.
