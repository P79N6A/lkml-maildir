I'm NEVER using loops for delays, I find this awful and always a waste of
time. But sometimes, you want to benchmark some algorithms, and the compiler
makes this difficult by eliminating things it thinks are useless. I once had
this problem when comparing several linked lists algorithms, for example.
Moreover, some people complain about the fact that gcc doesn't optimize
everything because of people using loops for delays. If we provide convenient
ways to help the user tell gcc when not to optimize, gcc could optimize
everything possible by default.
Cheers,
Willy
