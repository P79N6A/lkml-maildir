That sounds like a reasonable explanation if that is what is actually
happening.  Does the serial console driver revert to a polling
behavior when interrupts are off?
What should the console do in this situation? If called to printk with
interrupts off, and the backlog buffer is full, should it suspend the
system like it is doing, or should it toss the printk and return an
error?
