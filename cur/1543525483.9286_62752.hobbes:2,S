Actually ... last time I checked for expletives in the source code a very
large percentage were from "professionals" as in people employed by large
software firms.
I also recall somone saying the netscape code had to be "cleaned" before
they released source.. seem to recall somone printing off the lines
cleaned off... "Fucking sun blows goats" mean anything to anyone?
I'm not descuded on how I feel about the language in the kernel but please
don't call it non professional since clearly the professionalls all do it.
Just ... they do it behind closed doors where it can't be seen.
