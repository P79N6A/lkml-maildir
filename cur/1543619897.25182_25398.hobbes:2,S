greets 'n stuph,
compiling clean from 2.5.2 tarball, inclusion of sbpcd driver broke the compile.
saw mention of a problem with sbpcd a fair while ago, didn't find a resolution to it.
is this a known bug? is there a patch available, or in the pipeline?
looks straightforward, well, to somebody that can code, and that isn't myself ;)
