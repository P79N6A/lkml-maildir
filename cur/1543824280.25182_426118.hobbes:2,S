You're getting farther than I am.  My system crashes in init_8259A right
in the unlocking of the i8259A_lock.  It takes an exception in the
local_irq_restore of the raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore.  I tried unlocking
the lock and locking it again at the beginning of the function, and that
seems to work fine.  But this function didn't change between the
previous versions that do work.  So I think something is very wacky
going on someplace else.
Unfortunately, I'm very behind in the work that I get paid for, so I
really don't have any more time to look into this.  Especially since my
main developing machine happens to be my x86_64.
Hopefully, Ingo can find something, or I catch up and can work on this
again.
