That's not the purpose.
#if 0'ed code is both marked as unused and does no longer bloat the 
kernel.

You are misunderstanding this part of my patch.
It does NOT remove used debug code.
It does #if 0 code that was not used with CONFIG_ZD1211RW_DEBUG=y.

I've only #if 0'ed "static inline" functions when they were the only 
user of an otherwise unused global function.
The main question is what your "should be used" means.
Will they be used within the next days/weeks or only in some far future?
In the first case, I agree that my patch shouldn't be applied now.
In the latter case, there's no reason to bloat the kernel binary now for 
some future usage that might or might not happen.
