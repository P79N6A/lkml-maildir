Thanks for confirming that this isn't an ACPI bug;-)
I think what's happening is that one of the devices on IRQ9 is pulling
on that line.  ACPI is the 1st to register a handler on IRQ9, doesn't
know where the interrupts are coming from, and IRQ9 gets shut down
before the responsible device can register.

There are a couple of things you can do to debug.
boot with "noirqdebug" to treat the symptom.  This will prevent IRQ9
from getting disabled.  If a device registers and claims those
interrupts, then the system will function.  If none does, then you'll
see IRQ9 in /proc/interrupts steadily climb and performance will be
poor.
remove your USB, yenta and eth1 hardware and see if one makes the issue
go away.

You can also use a feature in ACPI to distribute the interrupts and
perhaps isolate the offending device.  Boot with...
acpi_irq_balance acpi_irq_pci=3,4,5,7 acpi_irq_isa=9
This should tell the code to balance interrupts across IRQs where
possible, tending towards 3,4,5,7 and avoiding 9; it already tends
towards 10.
