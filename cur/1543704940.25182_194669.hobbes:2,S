If this is the case and if there are other applications affected by this
than Enemy Territory and Wine mentioned in bug #1959, maybe the 
"use mmap_valid 0/1" option should made selectable by the user in 
kernel menuconfig? Of course with the proper "Caution: selecting 
mmap_valid may cure some applications while hurting the others" warnings
attached.
I mean, for example I thought for a long time that cs46xx is much more 
badly broken in kernel 2.[56].x than it in reality seems to be. No new 
sound bugs ever since I've applied this mmap_valid 0-->1 patch and I 
think the first time I patched the driver was around 2.6.0-test1.
The sound card I have is Hercules SoundFusion Fortissimo III 7.1 
(or something like that).
