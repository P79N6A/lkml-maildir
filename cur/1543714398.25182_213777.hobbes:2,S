Subject: select returns unexpected errno 514 on signal (Linus was going to fix this?)

When debugging (with gdb) a usermode program which receives a signal during 
select(), select returns -1 and sets errno to 514, rather than the expected 
EINTR.
Googling finds this reply from Linus to a similar thread a couple years ago, 
which seems to suggest a patch was to be applied. If so, it hasn't been (this 
machine is running 2.6.3)

Ahh, dang, there's a patch floating around for this case. Basically, 
 tracing interferes with the normal behaviour (ie you _shouldn't_ see this 
 normally, only when tracing system calls).
