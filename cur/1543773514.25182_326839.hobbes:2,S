Of course not, the patch would have to be magic for that to happen.  
But some user space apps are now *required* to use rdtsc for timing due
to the massive performance difference.  If we only took a 5x or 10x
performance hit vs rdtsc, rather than the current 50x, it might be
enough that user space apps won't have to do this.
