Nothing. Somethings is reeding /proc/partitions which lists all known
partitions. "fdisk" or "mount" do this.
When reading the file the kernel has to check the media in your zip-drive.
Problem is, you havn't put in one. So there is no partition table to read
and the kernel complains and returns the default values of a typical
100MB zip media.
