Subject: 2.3.6-ac1 won't compile: apm.c and kernel.o
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi, folks.  I couldn't compile 2.3.6-ac1 because there's an #ifdef on line
226 of arch/i386/kernel/apm.c that doesn't have any #endif.
I decided to just get rid of that #ifdef APM_DEBUG, since I didn't care if
the kernel became slightly bigger.
Now I can't compile the kernel because ld complains:
arch/i386/kernel/kernel.o: In function `standby':
arch/i386/kernel/kernel.o(.text+0x1b72): undefined reference to `set_time'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
I have no idea what's happening here.
Does anyone know what I should do?  I've attached my .config file.  In the
meanwhile, I'm going to reverse the ac1 patch and go back to stock 2.3.6,
since that seems to compile just fine.
I hope the vger lag doesn't cause this to be a redundant question :>
Thanks.
