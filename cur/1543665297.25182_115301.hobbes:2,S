I see. But I still somehow can not understand how merging is
possible. Merge possibly means work-by-hand, right? So it is not as
simple as noting that 1.8 and 1.7.1.1 were merged into 1.9, no? [And
what if developer did really crap job at merging that, like dropping
all changes from 1.7.1.1?]

Yep, that's what I wanted to know. [I see per-branch repository is
pain, but it helps me to understand that.]
Thanx for your explanations,
