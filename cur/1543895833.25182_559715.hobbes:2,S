speaking of CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND, I've encountered at least one device -- a 
Canon EOS 5D camera -- that, after the bus suspends, must be powercycled 
in order to return the camera's interrupt endpoints to a functional state. 
How are these types of problems handled, currently?  Is this something for 
a blacklist?
