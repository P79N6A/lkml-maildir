Well, my generic HDLC works with HDLC framing only, T1/E1 is
a layer lower than that... I think Cyclades have (had?) a version
of PC300 card with T1/E1 interface. It at least doesn't require
any "binary blobs", though I think the driver would need some work.
Which line interface do you need? G.703?
Do you need to bridge multiple streams (not slots) over one
interface (internal (de)multiplexer - I mean "more than one
subset of channels")?
