I didn't say that 'q' wrote out anything.  I was asking that 'q' and
'x' operate similar to vi, but now they operate exactly opposite from
vi.
In cmlconfigure, 'x' means exit and don't save.  In vi, 'x' means
save & exit (or is a synonym for :wq ).
In cmlconfigure, 'q' means save & exit.  In vi, 'q' means abort/quit
*right now*.

Fixed where?  I can't see that the web page(s) changed any.

Maybe that's the answer then.  I didn't get it from a distribution,
I downloaded it from a mirror listed at
www.python.org/download/download_source.html.
