... and my good feeling was right. Changing the bogus assembly code made the 
bug go away. I'll try to prepare a simpler testcase for the GCC maintainers 
tomorrow. For short, this is what happens: GCC tries to free its stack frame 
for the local variables far too early. It then calls __down_failed(), which 
pushes some things on the stack - thereby corrupting the semaphore pointer! 
So __down() works on a random memory location instead of the semaphore, which 
is guaranteed to fail badly. 
I've added linux-kernel as CC again, so everybody can now hear that this is 
definitely a GCC bug, and not a kernel issue.
Greetings,
Andreas
