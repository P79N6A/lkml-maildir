I must admit a little confusion here.  Clearly, kernel header files are
used at the user level.  The kernel and user level applications must share
definitions for a great many things.
Perhaps more precisely, the rule is that kernel header files should not be
#include'd directly from user level applications, but may be #include'd
indirectly through other header files as appropriate?
    Thanx...
