A good JIT supporting infrastructure is a requirement of a high quality
implementation otherwise someone will complain.  But at the same time
only the inner loops really need to be optimized.  The rest of the code
will be much less noticable.

Nope that doesn't help.  The trap rate is ruled by the number of instructions
that must be emulated.  Not by the timer.  I haven't profiled this closely but
it matches with my experience with dosemu.  Given the increasing cost of traps,
and the relative fixed frequency of instructions that require traps to
be emulated, I believe it can be shown that using the native cpu is an
increasing bad idea.
The worst case is using an ega 4 plane mode, and emulating it.  Which
is actually faster to emulate all of the instructions in than to take
traps when there are instructions you must emulate.

I contend that v86 mode has stunted the growth of more powerful techniques on
Linux because v86 mode is so trivial to use.  Not implementing v86 mode in
the kernel of x86-64 should encourage all of the nice techniques that need to
be built.
For most JIT recompilation all that needs to be written is a fast loop
scanning for instructions that must be emulated.  If those instructions
are not present on a page the page is good to go.  For questionable pages
you can do something else.

You don't want to try it in the simulator?  Is it to slow for you?
I have gone as far as testing switching in and out of long mode, and it is not
to difficult.   But I have not setup exception handlers to reflect
things from 32bit mode to 64bit mode etc.
