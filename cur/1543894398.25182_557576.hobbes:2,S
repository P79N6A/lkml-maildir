The open coding of shifts, masks, and other associated cruft is a real
problem. It leads to ugly and hard to understand code when you have to do
anything complex. That means when you come back to that code 6 months later,
you've got to take to the time to understand exactly what all that logic is
doing again.
IMO, xfs_page_state_convert() is a great example of where open coding
of PAGE_CACHE_SIZE manipulations lead to eye-bleeding code. This
patch set would go a long way to help clean up that mess.
IOWs, like hch, I think this patch set stands on it's own merit
regardless of concerns over variable page cache page sizes....
Cheers,
Dave.
