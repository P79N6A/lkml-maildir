This week's kernel status is available at the usual URL:
  
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/status
Question for the crowd:
Does anyone know what is the status of these "cleanup" items? 
o in -mm  Avoid dcache_lock while path walking  (Maneesh Soni, IBM team)  
o Ready  Switch to ->get_super() for file_system_type  (Al Viro)  
o Beta  file.h and INIT_TASK  (Benjamin LaHaise)  
o Beta  Proper UFS fixes, ext2 and locking cleanups  (Al Viro)  
o Beta  Lifting limitations on mount(2)  (Al Viro)  
Unless I hear otherwise, I will remove them soon, they have been 
in there forever.
Thanks!
-- Guillaume
