The new pc8736x_gpio driver has at least 1 bug, which manifests when
module is rmmod'd then re-modprobe'd.  This 3 part patchset addresses it 
as follows:
1 - add constant defines - preparatory patch
- adds #define CONSTs  for max-pin,  gpio-addr-range (for reserving region)
- fix wrong max-pin check in gpio_open()
- add 'Winbond' to module description:  NSC sold the product, Winbond 
has us / lm-sensors
        pc-const-decl      - define several symbolic constants
        pc-open-const    - use reduced max-pin to what hardware supports
        pc-req-region-const        - can wait, but why
        pc-mod-desc-add-winbond    -
since this is just preparatory work, it still exhibits the bug:

2 - pc-init-fix-undo-region-rollup
this patch fixes module-init-func by repairing usage of 
platform_device_del/put in module-exit-func,
ie it imitates Ingo's 'mishaps' patch, which fixed the 
module-init-func's undo handling.
Also fixes lack of release_region to undo the earlier registration.
Also included:
- add include <linux/cdev.h> - needed by next patches
and cuz theyre within the diff-context-window:
- remove include <linux/config.h>      everyone's doing it
- copyright updates - current date is 'wrong'
the patch fixes the above bug, reducing it to a different one; (which is 
fixed by 3rd patch)

3 - pc-init-fix-chrdev-region-rollup
- Switch from register_chrdev() to   (register|alloc)_chrdev_region().
- use a cdev.   This was intended for original patchset, but was overlooked.
We use a single cdev for all pins (minor device-numbers), as gleaned 
from cs5535_gpio,
and in contrast to whats currently done in scx200_gpio (which I'll fix soon)
By some reasoning, this patch should have been combined with patch 2; 
the fixes
are to the same 2 mod-init/exit functions, and both touch cdevs, 
regions, etc.
Despite this, I separated them (incompletely).  I'll combine them if 
thats better..
Given that this is a brand new driver, can I assume a bit more latitude to
clean up and normalize the code ?     For example, s/DEVNAME/DRVNAME/
would improve consistency with other drivers.  The scx200_gpio driver 
could also
stand some improvements; a single cdev, and same DRVNAME normalization.
Whats the right way to mark this as (NEW/EXPERIMENTAL) ?
Is either appropriate for a reworked / existing driver (scx200_gpio)
cc'g  AKPM since (I think) he pushed this driver to mainline.
thanks
