Sure you can. And it was assumed that the MAC address provided by
the manufacturer would always be used by the software for the MAC
address on the wire. However, 'software engineers' have decided
that they don't have to follow the rules, so they provide hooks
so you can use a MAC address of anything.  They even call it
"Local Administration...", which decoded means; "Screw the
committee".
But....
If you ever sell a controller that contains an address that was
not allocated to the 'producer', somebody is going to get very
angry. This means, to me, that if you ever write a new MAC address
to that card/board, you had better throw it away when you are done.
It's easier to make sure that the MAC address doesn't get changed.
You still "screw the comittee" locally, but you don't modify the
hardware.
