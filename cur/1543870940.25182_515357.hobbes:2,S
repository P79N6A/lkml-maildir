Two observations:
- We probably don't want people using this for locks that aren't
  explicitly in the same level of the hierarchy. The name should
  somehow indicate that. Something like spin_lock_siblings()?
- And once we know that, we can internally impose a natural stable
  ordering on them based on their addresses, eliminating the third
  argument and the need to duplicate the ordering calculation.
