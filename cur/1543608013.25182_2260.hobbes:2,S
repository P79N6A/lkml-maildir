What happens is a module is distributed as a combination of open-source .c 
files and closed-source .o files.  That is, it's "mixed source" - part of the 
driver is open-source and part is closed-source.  What happens if the 
open-source version of the driver is the only code that uses GPL-only symbols. 
  How is that handled?
