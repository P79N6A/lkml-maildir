Read it the other way around:
He fixed a bug where some network devices where feeding the pool illegally
and making your system "unsecure". The "bug-fix" is configurable so you
can choose for yourself, if you want to have the "old broken unsecure"
bahaviour or you want to disable all entropy feeding by NICs and want your
processes get stuck when reading /dev/random.
