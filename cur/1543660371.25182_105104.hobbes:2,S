Possibly related...  I was using SCSI tape to back up my 2.5.59 system
the other day.  A media error was encountered, but the application (cpio
in this case) never saw the error and kept on trying to write to the bad
tape.  Fortunately, I caught it after only 40 MB of associated syslog
entries had been made.
Thanks for the patch.  I can now go back to "unattended" backup mode
(except for having to change tapes periodically) :-).
