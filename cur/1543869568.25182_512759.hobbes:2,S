What I meant is that we currently do not use the 'unit' term for code
modules in the linux kernel at all.

You should not separate more but less.  Generelly the review-"unit"
should be a functionally separate kenrel module, not microscopic pieces
of it.  Unfortunately there are mailinglist limitations why we sometimes
have to split things up a little further, but it's usually really hard
to do useful splits at this boundary.
