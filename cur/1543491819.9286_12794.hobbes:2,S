Hi,
I wonder if anyone else has this problem:
My new system built some weeks ago has this strange behaviour:
While running X and moving the mouse it (the mouse pointer)
sometimes stops moving for a short moment and then continues
again. At the moment the mouse pointer is moving again there is
disk activity. Somehow I think it is related, maybe an IRQ
conflict or such though cat /proc/interrupts reveals nothing,
not even a single irq seems dedicated to the serial ports:

The mouse is connected to serial port ttyS2 and has its own irq
(7 or 9, have to check the board)
the lp ports don't use irqs (polling)
The system runs, apart from this problem, fine and completely
stable, tested with 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, just this mouse thing is
annoying me. The mouse movement is also quite 'sluggish'.
The Linux distribution I'm running is RH (upgraded several times
to 5.2 now) and the mouse problem didn't exist when I still had
the Asus board with AMD-K6-233. (Same IO card(s) and SCSI
devices, then on AHA2940UW adapter)
