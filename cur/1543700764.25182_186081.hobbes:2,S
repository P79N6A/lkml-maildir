Hi,
Pretty out of the place I am, and beg your pardon. I have modified my kernel 2.6.0 with few new functions in fs/kernthread.c, which required a header file linux/kernthread.h.
On compilation, I get this error:
fs/built-in.o(.text+0x242f1): In function 'stop_kernthread' :
 : undefined reference to 'lock_kernel'
make: ***[.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Could someone help me out with this.
Thanks in advance.
Sumit
