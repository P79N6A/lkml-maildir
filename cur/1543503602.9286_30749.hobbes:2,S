hello , 
i belive this is an old problem since this is not the first time i heard
about it. 
ping ing with ping -R from through a firewall machine make the firewall go
into kernel panic 
tried to kill idle task 
not syncing 
etc. etc. 
does anyone know a fix for the problem ? 
or a set of rules that will fix the problem ? 
i believe ping -R works only on about nine hops... what bothers me 
is that nine hops can be a lot of subnets :( 
Thanks for any help
