Thanks Arthur!
The machine seems to work except for the errors. Is there a way to update 
the drivers in the OS without having to upgrade the kernel. I guess we'll 
first have to find out which driver is misbehaving !!
I'll try the 'mce=off' and 'iommu=off' options again. I'll keep you 
posted.
Thanks again,
Saurabh.
