I like positive logic too.
I went so far as to try to implement this back when I deleted "noht".
The problem is that "!CONFIG_HT" is meaningless.  It implies that
you can have CONFIG_ACPI but still "config-out" HT, which you can't.
Ie. The 2nd row above says to give me ACPI w/o HT.
If you delete that row and reverse the polarity you get:
!CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY, CONFIG_ACPI == ACPI
CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY, !CONFIG_ACPI == HT-only ACPI
!CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY, !CONFIG_ACPI == no ACPI
Here we can use config to emphasize that it is not possible to select
CONFIG_ACPI and CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY at the same time.
Cheers,

Ps. Note that in 2.6 CONFIG_X86_HT exists and covers the sibling code.
It depends on CONFIG_SMP, and CONFIG_ACPI_HT_ONLY depends on it. (in the
ACPI patch)
