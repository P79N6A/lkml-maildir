I looked at this a while ago and my decision at the time was to keep the
old implementation around for a while and create two new ones that match
the x86 numbering:
#define PTRACE_GETREGS            12
#define PTRACE_SETREGS            13
#define PTRACE_GETFPREGS          14
#define PTRACE_SETFPREGS          15
I hate gratuitous differences, each ptrace app ends up with a sea of
ifdefs.
Also I think it would be worth changing getregs/setregs to grab the
entire pt_regs structure. Otherwise most ops (gdb, strace etc) will just
have to make multiple ptrace calls to get the nia etc.
