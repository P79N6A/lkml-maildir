It works OK here.  Could you please check that the kernel was fully
rebuilt?  Do a `make clean'?  If the kernel was not fully rebuilt
then things will go wrong because a structure size was changed.
There is a locking error in that patch, and it needs revision.  But
that wouldn't explain this crash.
And there is an unrelated use-after-free bug which could cause problems
if the fs runs out of space or inodes.
I'll get some fixes out later today.  It hasn't been a good week.
