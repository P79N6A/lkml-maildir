We are currently trying to remove exports not used by any in-kernel 
code.
The patch description also lacks the name of what you call "external 
debuggers" (I assume the exports are not for a theoretical usage but for 
an already existing debugger?). There is no reason for keeping a patch 
description small.
Especially nowadays where people demand deprecation periods for removing 
exports without any in-kernel users there must be a _very_ good 
justification when adding such exports.
This is true for both the i386 and the x86_64 patches.
