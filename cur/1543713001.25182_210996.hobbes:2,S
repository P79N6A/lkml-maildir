Its so broken that we do not want compatibility, I believe. Having to
use snd-via82xx=,,,,,2 normally, but add one "," if joystick is
configured in is evil.
snd-via82xx=enable:1 syntax is ugly, too, and we have better syntax
already. via82xx.enable=1 via82xx.ac97_quirk=2 should be possible with
new param handling code. I'm just not sure how it is supposed to work
with arrays:
static char *psmouse_proto;
static unsigned int psmouse_max_proto = -1U;
module_param_named(proto, psmouse_proto, charp, 0);
MODULE_PARM_DESC(proto, "Highest protocol extension to probe (bare,
imps, exps). Useful for KVM switches.");
...automatically produces "proto" param for module and "psmouse.proto"
param for kernel.
Something similar should be the way to go.
