Should we do something with these?

This is not a good idea, because the driver doesn't call tty_register_device at 
all. It fixes it, because it doesn't "reserve" the names and you can silently 
register the other driver, that might use it. This is wrong.
We have a few options:
- rewrite them to use TTY_DRIVER_DYNAMIC_DEV (I'm going to do this in isicom anyway)
- rename tty->names (will this something break? udev should cope with this, 
doesn't it?)
- any other solution?
