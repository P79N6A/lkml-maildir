the kdump people were looking at making the kernel runtime relocatable
at one point, which with my distro-vendor hat on, would be useful
as it'd mean we could use the same kernel image for normal boot, and
also for the 'kdump kernel'  (Right now, we ship another set of
kernels for each arch with a different PHYSICAL_START).
(You wouldn't believe how much grief we get from the installer folks
 for adding another set of kernel images to the ISOs).
I think that work stalled a while back though.
