First, it is very arguable to say that they are "distributing" the
software as it does not comes with the FreeBox but is automatically
downloaded at each boot through the DSLAM network (which the user is not
supposed to know about).
Second, if you take the example of the LinkSys case, there was an
indirect way of getting all these informations (their website) and
_still_ you don't have all the informations you claimed in the boxes
that LinkSys is selling but on their website.

If you want to know more about the _usage_ (and in matter of justice and
laws the usage is often more important than what is written down),
I would suggest you take a look at the LinkSys case.
