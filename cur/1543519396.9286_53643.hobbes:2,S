I can't find any mention of mount(8) or mount(2) in SUSv2 or POSIX.1.

Good point. After coming up with a patch which solves this, I then
discovered that umount(8) already follows symlinks in userland
before it calls umount(2) (actually oldumount(2)). That means that
mount(8) works fine with my original patch even for symlinks like
/dev/cdrom. It also works OK with mine because if I do
    mount -t mls ... /tmp/mls
then readlink on /tmp/mls produces "[MLS]" while follow_link does
the magic of redirection. umount(8) tried to find /tmp/[MLS], fails
with ENOENT and then goes and ahead and calls oldumount(2) on
"/tmp/mls", trusting that the caller knows what they're doing.
If having the system call itself follow symlinks where appropriate
is considered absolutely necessary (rather than leaving it up to
userland) then the following patch solves it, but it looks to me as
though the kernel is cleaner if it just assumes the caller passes in
the right name to start with.
The patch below starts by doing an lnamei and then checks if the
resulting symlink is indeed a mountpoint itself. If not, then it does
an ordinary namei to follow any potential link and reproduce the old
behaviour. This one's against 2.2 but there's no significant
difference between that and 2.3 as far as this bit goes.
