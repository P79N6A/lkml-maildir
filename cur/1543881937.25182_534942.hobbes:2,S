Oops, no, /dev/tty?? are for virtual consoles.
But I think I found the problem.
In short, in /dev/pts is mounted before /dev. I remounted it and ssh worked
fine again.
I'll dig mandrivas rc's to check this...
Anyways, I see no plain 'mount' command in /sbin/start_udev, all are 
'mount --move' commands. So I think it supposes is already mounted and
tries to move it.
