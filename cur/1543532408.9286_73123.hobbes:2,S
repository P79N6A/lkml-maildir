What does this handler do? Get more stack space, or terminate the program?

I have a radical idea: Let's let everybody use as much stack as they
need. If the system runs out of memory, something has to give up memory
anyway, and we then select a memory hog and kill it. Won't be used much, as
a reasonably speced system won't get near this in its entire life.
Oops... that is what we have today with Rik's patch...

This is what the kernel does today, without involving a sysadmin. And if
there is no more memory, no fancy scheme will get you around that fact
anyway. This makes the problem _worse_ by stealing memory from processes
that need it just in case this process might want to use it in the far future.
