Are you able to reproduce the problem without loading the NVidia
drivers? If no, you know who to complain to.
Second question, are the Zip100-drive-related errors in dmesg something
unusual and thus probably related to the problem?

If yes, I'd suggest you disable ppa for a while and see if it solves the
problem.
