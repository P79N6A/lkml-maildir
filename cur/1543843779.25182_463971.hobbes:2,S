I think the point being made is that we don't want to confuse this with 
vendors disclaiming support for non-shipped kernel modules. Vanilla kernels 
shouldn't consider GPL modules to be "unsupported" just because they aren't 
shipped or "digitally signed"; however we certainly should be highlighting 
the use of proprietary modules (which are obviously impossible to debug).
I agree with Lee, there should be some more black marks on proprietary drivers 
than there are currently.
