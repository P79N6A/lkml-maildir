If you want to point a finger, I suppose you could say it's EHCI's fault.  
However, this is how things are _supposed_ to work (all except for the 
"cupsd will hang forever part" -- it's not clear whether that's a kernel 
issue or an application program issue).
The idea is that each USB connector on your motherboard is wired to two
USB controller ports: one on a UHCI controller (for low- and full-speed
devices) and one on the EHCI controller (for high-speed devices).  The
connections are controlled by switches inside the EHCI controller.
Initially the switches are set to hook each connector up to a UHCI
controller, so your devices enumerate on the various UHCI buses.  Then
when ehci-hcd gets loaded it takes over, and the switches are changed to
hook each device up to the EHCI controller.  As far as the UHCI
controllers are concerned this looks like the devices were unplugged.  
Hence all those "disconnect" messages.
If you were to continue looking farther down in the log, you would find
that ehci-hcd sees all those devices.  Those that can run at high speed
continue using the EHCI controller.  For those that can't, the switch is 
reset and they get reconnected to their UHCI controller.
All this backing and forthing would be eliminated if the ehci-hcd driver
was loaded before uhci-hcd rather than after.  Perhaps you can fiddle with
your startup scripts to make that happen.  But even if things always go
the way you showed here, the devices should all work properly in the end.
