Hi Marcelo, Neil,
I've tested -pre4 on my alpha, and noticed that knsfd doesn't work anymore :
the client sticks in D state forever. It has been working flawlessly for
weeks with 2.4.22-rc2. What's strange is that 23-pre4 is OK on my athlon with
the same nfs-utils (1.0.5).
I have the following NFSD options on both kernels :
CONFIG_NFSD=m
CONFIG_NFSD_V3=y
CONFIG_NFSD_TCP=y
My alpha kernels were build with GCC 3.2.3, while the athlon one is done with
2.95.3.
If I have some time, I'll try intermediate kernels to find which one brought
the problem. I noticed that there were knfsd changes in 2.4.23-pre3, perhaps
they're related. If you want me to try a patch, please ask.
Cheers,
Willy
