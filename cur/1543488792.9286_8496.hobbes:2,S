No, just the person I responded to. He made an emotional appeal based
on some kind of glorious fight against mediocrity.
Those that wrote the DSM code state that it has little impact on the
rest of the kernel. Do you claim that they lie?

Just about any shared memory app fits, given the right run length,
cluster size, developer time constraints, and developer experience.
The exact numbers are nothing: it is obvious that a rewrite will
take more developer time than the adjustments needed for DSM.
