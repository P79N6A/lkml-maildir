 Because this is much easier to do in userspace, it's just not very
well documented that you should almost always call poll() with a zero
timeout first. However it's been there for years, and things have used
it[1].
 There are still optimizations that could have been done to poll() to
speed it up but Linus has generally refused to add them.
