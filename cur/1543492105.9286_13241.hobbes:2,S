Sounds like you have your system set so the hardware clock runs in
non-UTC mode, possibly because you also have Win9x present and it
requires that?
My fix was to add the following command to the shutdown script:
 Q> hwclock --systohc
This has the effect of resetting the hardware clock to the system
clock time at that point, so avoids such problems...
Best wishes from Riley.
