I don't see any advantage of that over linking /tmp to /var/tmp.  The
only issue with not having /tmp on the root filesystem is if it's
needed before the rest of the filesystems are mounted, and you'd have
the same problem with a separate /tmp or a symlink.

Not for /dev - for the frequently modified files in /etc, like
/etc/shadow (assuming you make people change passwords regularly...)
