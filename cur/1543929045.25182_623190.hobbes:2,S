Surprise, surprise.  There's no way to tell whether the controller
raised interrupt or not if command is not in progress.  As I said
before, there's no IRQ pending bit.  While processing commands, you can
tell by looking at other status registers but when there's nothing in
flight and the controller determines it's a good time to raise a
spurious interrupt, there's no way you can tell.  That dang SFF
interface is like 15+ years old.
But we can still make things pretty robust.  We're working on it.
Thanks.
