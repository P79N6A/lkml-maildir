Hi there..
Just received a 3ware 7500-8 RAID card and am trying to get it installed
on a dual Athlon system with 4GB of RAM, running 2.4.19.
SCSI support and SCSI disk support are enabled.
Low level support for 3w-xxxx is enabled.
The RAID has been flashed to the latest hardware revision.
Kernel loads up fine, and gets to initializing the card, where it waits
for a while as it attempts to init and reinit, etc, the card.  Ultimately,
it simply resets the card and takes the card offline.  'dmesg' reports
the following in the kernel log:
scsi0 : Found a 3ware Storage Controller at 0xc400, IRQ: 11, P-chip: 1.3
scsi0 : 3ware Storage Controller
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (0xf4d53800) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (0xf4d53800) timed out, resetting card.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Reset succeeded.
3w-xxxx: scsi0: Unit #0: Command (0xf4d53800) timed out, resetting card.
scsi: device set offline - not ready or command retry failed after host reset: 
host 0 channel 0 id 0 lun 0
Any ideas what the problem might be?
