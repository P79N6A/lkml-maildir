Hi,
I have been having problems installing Debian on a new machine, and also
with X Windows. Someone advised me that one problem appeared sufficiently
serious that I should email this address about it - hence this email.
>> The problem is that:
>>
>> The computer will freeze in the shell for no apparent reason, and will
not
>> respond to ctrl-alt-delete. The only thing to do is to reboot.
>>
>> It will not respond to caps lock, scroll lock, shift, num lock, virtual
console switches, etc.
>>
>> I can't
>> identify anything which triggers the freezing - sometimes it will happen
>> after only a few seconds of keyboard inactivity, sometimes after
prolonged
>> periods. If I reboot using the button on the box, it will boot normally
>> after scanning the partitions as a result of the improper shutdown. I am
>> using slink, on a secondary HDD (entirely devoted to Debian - 2.5 gig),
and
>> have an Intel Celeron 500MHz processor with 128 KB cache. This freezing
also
>> happened on occasion during the install process - while the system was
still
>> running off the initial Debian Rescue boot disk!!! - ie before any
>> configuration.
>>
>> My machine has a mainboard (as opposed to a motherboard) with integrated
>> video card function. - ie there is no separate physical video card. The
>> mainboard is a Gigabyte GA-6WMMC7-1 series Intel 810 Chipset with
integrated
>> VGA. I can dig out more system spec's as needed, since I have the manual.
>>
>> I have had a look on the Web, and can't find any specific reference to
this
>> problem.
>>
>> Also I have problems attempting to run X Windows - I can set up an
xf86Config file, and start X windows, but then the machine freezes after
displaying a greatly enlarged login prompt box, and I cannot do anything
with it. (no mouse movement, no ctrl-backspace, no caps lock, no
ctrl-alt-delete....)
Any help would be appreciated!
