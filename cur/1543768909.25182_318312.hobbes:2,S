While linux is not a real time OS it has been always known that
turning off interrupts for a long time is extremly rude.
If you really want you can use touch_nmi_watchdog in the delay
loop then.  But note you have to compile it in, because touch_nmi_watchdog
is not exported (Linus vetoed that for good reasons).
But again do you really need to disable interrupts during this
i2c access? Can't you just use a schedule_timeout() and a semaphore?
Why would other interrupts cause a problem during such a long delay?
