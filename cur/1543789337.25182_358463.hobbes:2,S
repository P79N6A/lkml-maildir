I like the layout.
I'm not completely sure whether mouse0 and event0 are the same class,
because they have different APIs and protocols. And I believe that class
is exactly that - a collection of devices where you can use the same API
to access them. A possibility would be to do it like this:

It might be too much work to create a new class in each of the
handlers, it'd be similar to harddrives and partititions having
different classes.

Having 'mice' at top level is not very nice. It's a logical consequence
of the system, and as such probably correct, though.
