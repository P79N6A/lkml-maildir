What would I like it to do?  Warn me maybe before my swap goes to zero.  Kill the
program that is doing this possibly.  Allow me to set a per process memory / swap
limit so that no one process can suck up my system resources.
I'd rather not increase swap if possible, as it was only this one page that hosed
my system, and other than that, my system doesn't swap that much if at all.
