Hello,
I have just been bit by this bug(hardware?) while using the
2.4.0-prerelease kernel. The fix has been included in recent
2.2.19pre kernels and I was wondering if there are plans to
include it in 2.4. It requires a reboot to repair so it is
a bit of a problem ;)
Also, is it a confirmed hardware bug?
Thanks for the great work so far,
Shane
