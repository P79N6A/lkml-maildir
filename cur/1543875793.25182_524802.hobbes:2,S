Could you just use their name?  It's a little distracting otherwise.

Would it be possible to get a trace showing what the rpc traffic during
the above test?  You could run something like
	tcpdump -s0 -wTMP host my-client.example.com
and then post a copy of TMP someplace.  Or look at it yourself in
wireshark--what you're looking for is how the server replied to the
rpc's generated by the commands above, and whether the server's replies
were consistent.
