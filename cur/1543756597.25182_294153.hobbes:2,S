What magnitude is "few more"? 2, 10, 100?

Is there an easy way to bring pages to lowmem? The cryptoapi is called
from the backlog of the networking stack, which is assigned in irq
context first and processed softirq context. There is little opportunity
to bringt stuff to low mem. And we can't bringt stuff to lowmem on our
own as well, because (as I guess) this involves a page allocation, which
would have to be GFP_ATOMIC, which can fail. So we would need fallback
for the fallback mechanism, and that's still the tiny set of scratch
buffers.. hairy business..
Ok, what about the following plan:
If context == softirq, use kmap_atomic until they all used, fall-back to
scratch buffers, and printk in some DEBUG mode:"Warning slow, redesign
your client or raise the number of fixmaps".
If context == user, use kmap_atomic until they all used, and fall-back
to kmap.
