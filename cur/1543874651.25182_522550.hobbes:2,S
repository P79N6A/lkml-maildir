So what ? I am very happy for you Christoph.
Average linux machines (ie more than 99.99 % on this planet) are using MAX_NUMNODES <= 64
If you read my patch, your lovely 1024 nodes machines will run as before : No change at all for big machines.

Last time I checked 'struct page', they was no nodeid in it.
I cooked this patch because you told me it was possible to have a 'slab nodeid' different than page_to_nid(obj). Now you want me to prove the contrary. Me confused.
