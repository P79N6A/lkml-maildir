There are a lot of shitty drivers that this is going to catch.  Yes,
that is great... but we cannot BUG().  There really are a LOT of them. 
In the least, we need to show_trace().
Anyhow, this currently will catch _all_ kernel preemptions because the
PREEMPT_ACTIVE flag is set.
We need to do something like the attached (untested), at the very
least...
I would prefer to make this a kernel debugging check, however.  Or, make
using kernel preemption the default.  Using the "free" abilities of
kernel preemption is great, but not at the expense of its users.
