My team has seen an application which mallocs as much memory as
possible, up to 95% of system RAM, using multiple processes as
necessary, and then has threads which touch all the malloc'd bytes and
threads which touch all the malloc'd pages.  It keeps kswapd pretty
busy, such that you can get down to zero free and inactive clean
ZONE_NORMAL pages from which to allocate additional buffer_heads for
swapout, deadlocking the system.
We believe that by limiting the use of the reserved buffer_head pool
to PF_MEMALLOC tasks like kswapd, kswapd can make forward progress
even in extremely low memory situations.
Thanks,
Matt
