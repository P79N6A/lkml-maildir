On the other hand, even if the report was invalid (which another posting says isn't
the case), this code is just *begging* for somebody to "fix the typo", due to how
much the kernel uses
	foo = function(..)
	if (!foo)
Yeah, they're different variables - but we alloc mktblk and then return -ENOMEM
if the OTHER variable is null?? ;)
