No. That is just horrible. What's so wrong with simple flip-buffers that
they wouldn't work for you? Simple, and you can fill them up as fast as
you can and then flip. Sure, if nobody reads the buffers fast enough
you'll have trouble, but that's independent of how you do things. It's a
basic law of the universe (called the "if nobody is listening, it doesn't
matter how loudly or slowly you talk" law).
If you don't like the circular queues, you can just get rid of those.
Although I don't see what the difference between a circular queue and two
buffers you flip between really is. The circular queues work well for many
things, and are there because that's how the original tty layer worked..
