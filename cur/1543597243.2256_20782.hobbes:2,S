The problem, IMHO, is that we're trying to extend what is a correct behaviour on
the UP scheduler ( pickup the best task to run ) to SMP machines.
Global scheduling decisions should be triggered in response of load unbalancing
and not at each schedule() run otherwise we're going to introduce a common lock
that will limit the overall scalability.
My idea about the future of the scheduler is to have a config options users can
chose depending upon the machine use.
By trying to keep a unique scheduler for both UP and MP is like going to give
the same answer to different problems and the scaling factor ( of the scheduler
itself ) on SMP will never improve.
The code inside kernel/sched.c should be reorganized ( it contains even not
scheduler code ) so that the various CONFIG_SCHED* will not introduce any messy
inside the code ( possibly by having the code in separate files
kernel/sched*.c ).
