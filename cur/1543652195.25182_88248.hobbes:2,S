	linux-2.5.46/include/linux/kernel.h already defines
container_of(ptr_to_element, parent_struct, element_name).
From <linux/pci.h>:
#define to_pci_dev(n) container_of(n, struct pci_dev, dev)
From <linux/usb.h>:
#define to_usb_device(d) container_of(d, struct usb_device, dev)
From <asm-parisc/hardware.h> with my parisc device patch:
static inline struct parisc_device *to_parisc_dev(struct device *dev)
{
        return container_of(dev, struct parisc_device, device);
}
