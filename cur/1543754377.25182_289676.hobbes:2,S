There are various OOM killer improvements and fixes that have gone
into Andrew's kernel tree which should be included for 2.6.11.
I don't think the OOM killer was ever perfect in 2.6, but recent
tinkering in mm/ probably aggrivated it. *blush*
Here is another small OOM killer improvement. Previously we needed
to reclaim SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX pages in a single pass. That should be
changed so that we need only reclaim that many pages during the
entire try_to_free_pages run, without going OOM.
Andrea? Andrew? Look OK?
