Yeah, my experience with ->nopage so far has indicated to me that we are to
avoid erroring out if at all possible which I believe is what we'd have to
do if a deadlock is found.
Also, I'm not sure how multiple dlms would coordinate deadlock detection in
that case.
This may sound naive, but so far OCFS2 has avoided the nead for deadlock
detection... I'd hate to have to add it now -- better to try avoiding them
in the first place.
