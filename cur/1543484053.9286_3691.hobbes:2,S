I'm _not_ talking ISO C here, but GNU C. The linux kernel does use the GNU
extensions quite extensively. Might be a pain to migrate to the
corresponding features of C9x later, but it will happen in time.

C++ won't be used in the kernel, the kernel is written in (GNU) C. And
extern inline used to be supported well by gcc/egcs (at least up to
egcs-2.93.01, the latest snapshot before the current 2.93.04 I've got
here). That's exactly my point!
