I see, thanks for the comment. PNP_DRIVER_RES_DISABLE is used by ALSA only 
and used by _all_ ALSA ISA-PnP drivers (snd-sscape uses RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE 
instead but we should consider that one a consistency bug).
RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE is used by drivers/pnp/system.c and rtc-cmos.c as well. 
I'll look at this. Getting rid of DISABLE as a first step should not be 
overly problematic. This might again be a left-over from days where no easy 
to use interface to PnP existed which it now does in echoing things into sysfs.
Takashi: which reminds me -- crap, I promised to document more of that for 
ALSA use following up the recent pnp driver-side resource setting removal. 
Sorry, forgot, will do.

Thank you. Just pulled and see that's now indeed in. Wasn't in -rc7 yet...
Rene.
