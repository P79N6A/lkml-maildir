Hi,
I've tested the new driver for a couple of days, mostly by running
XDMCP session over the Gbit LAN. Its all working good.
I didn't experience any crashes or slowdowns at all. The driver is
definitly usefull in it current state.
Performance is good, tops at ~40MB/s.
BTW: what is this MSI patch?
gr,
Vasco
