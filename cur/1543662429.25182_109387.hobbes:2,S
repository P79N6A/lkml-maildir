Why? Stop for a second and look what we have in those dirs.
They both contain things that are essentially motherboard resources.
These are add-on cards we're talking about. Surely a more sensible
place for them to live is somewhere under devices/pci0/ or whatever
bus-type said card is for.
Whilst there are some watchdogs which _are_ part of the motherboard
chipset (which is arguably 'system'), these still show up in PCI
space as regular PCI devices.
Lumping them all into the same category as things like rtc, pic,
fdd etc is just _wrong_.
