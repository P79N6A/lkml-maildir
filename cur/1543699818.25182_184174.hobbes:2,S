Hi all,
Just a quick note saying I've been running my nforce2 for nearly four
days with considerable I/O and no trouble.
Processor: AMD Athlon XP 2700+
MB: ASUS A7N8X Deluxe
APCI: Turned off in kernel config
Boot params: acpi=off noapic
Kernel: 2.6.0-test11-bk7 + disconnect quirk patch
I still have a considerable number of spurious IRQs (but < 1%
compared to IRQ0 / LINT).  I'm not running the timer patch
at all.
I will try with latest bk kernel + disconnect  + acpi compiled in.
Questions.
1) Does anybody know the state of play ala 2.6.0 release and which
patches we can get in?
2) If the local apic is running is it necessary to use the 8254 as a 
timer?
3) Does anybody, anywhere, have any nvidia documentation and
is it worth trying to bully them into releasing some?
Cheers,
Ross
