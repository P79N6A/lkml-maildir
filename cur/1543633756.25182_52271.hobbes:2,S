Fair enough, the only reason I came up with this patch is that I
looked at all unaligned DMA done by USB, and
drivers/usb/storage/transport.c does DMA into sense_buffer.

Out of curiousity, how do you deal with someone writing to Scsi_Cmnd
_before_ the DMA and having that data lost when pci_map_single() with
PCI_DMA_FROMDEVICE invalidates the cache before writeback?
Best,
