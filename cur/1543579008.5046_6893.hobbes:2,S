I am rebooting with the patch from you (Chris) in about 30 seconds. This is
the output from reiserfs when booting:
reiserfs: checking transaction log (device 16:41) ...
reiserfs: replayed 5 transactions in 4 seconds
Using tea hash to sort names
reiserfs: using 3.5.x disk format
ReiserFS version 3.6.25
