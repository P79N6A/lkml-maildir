You missed the full purpose: the patch makes a function consistent about
its own assumptions (but leaves them in place since they're on the
better-safe-than-sorry side). It addresses assumptions inconsistency
(confusing for both human readers and static analysis tools) just as
much as it addresses a possible bug. Regardless of whether "inode" &
"bh_result" can be NULL, I don't think the following is OK (coding-wise):
	unsigned long max_blocks = bh_result->b_size >> inode->i_blkbits;
	if (!inode || !bh_result) {
		mlog(ML_ERROR, "inode or bh_result is null\n");
		return -EIO;
	}
> Can "inode" and "bh_result" be NULL here? I bet they can't
Great, then the NULL branch is dead code and we can fix consistency
differently:
