The capability is definitely desirable, I think it's just implementation
being discussed.

There are already uncompressed pure text files in the modules directory,
such as modules.dep. Adding one more is probably not a space issue on most
systems, while kernel size may be, since it has to be present at boot.
I don't have any issue with allowing a symbolic link in /proc down to the
config, if people want it there. I always Slink the /lib/modules/xxx dir
to /boot/Modules and the current symbols to /boot/System.map as well.
Links in known places are good.
