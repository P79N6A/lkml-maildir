I think we should first check that skb->dataref is really the problem: 
what about adding an unused field before the dataref? Something like
struct skb_shared_info {
+	int		unused;
 	atomic_t	dataref;
	int		debug;
If the dataref decrease causes the problem, then the affected offset should change to 0x628.
