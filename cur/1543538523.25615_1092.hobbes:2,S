I don't think so. This would cause corruption by the WinNT4 driver as 
well... (Unless there is a safe-guard in NT4 we are missing in linux.)

That's news to me! - Which bytes (offsets?) are you referring to exactly? - 
My understainding of the boot sector is at the bottom of the email - it is 
described in the MS WinNT4 ws resource kit book along with the partition 
and mbr structures,  I have integrated it into one structure for easier 
reading. - It doesn't have any magic AFAICS.

The version is changed from 1.2 in NT4 to 3.0 in Win2k (note: Gary 
Nebbett's book is wrong in stating that NT4 uses v2.1. At least on my PC it 
uses v1.2 when a new partition is formatted...). - The current linux driver 
actually reads the version number from special file $Volume, attribute 
$VolumeInformation to determine whether to allow write-mount of a ntfs 
partition (v3.0+ is mounted read-only). See fs/ntfs/super.c function 
ntfs_get_version().

Now that's a different question...

The bootstrap code on NTFS volumes is in fact longer than shown here. When
formating a NTFS partition the first 16 sectors are allocated for the partition
boot sector & bootstrap code.
The MFT is not located in a predefined sector & can be moved if there is a bad
sector in its normal location. If 0x30 and 0x38 do not point to valid targets,
NT4 assumes that the partition has not been formatted yet.
