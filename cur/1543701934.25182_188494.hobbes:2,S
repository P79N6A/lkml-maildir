Subject: RAID1 resync speed in 2.6.0

I just set up a largish (~100 GB) RAID1 array under Linux 2.6.0.  Now,
/proc/mdstat is happily telling me that the resync will be completed
in 3700 minutes.  This seems terribly slow to me.  At first, it
wouldn't work at all, complaining about "bio too big", so I changed
RESYNC_BLOCK_SIZE to 32k.
Is there a way to mark the superblocks as up to date manually?  I
don't really care what a read will return for parts of the array that
I haven't written to yet.
