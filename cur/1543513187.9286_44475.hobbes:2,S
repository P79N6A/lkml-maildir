Umhm... While you are at it, don't forget to ask him about the effects of
flicker and their dependency on the average brightness. It's more than
enough to outweight the effect you are refering to. CRT (any CRT) does
flicker. While the normal vision can accomodate to 70-odd Hz flicker with
no problems _if_ the large part of the field is dark. Make it bright and
you will seriously increase the strain. It's enough to turn marginally
tolerable situation into hell. I.e. people who have bad vision or bad
lighting or have to look at the screen for many hours or have monitors
with lower frame frequency, etc. will be very unhappy about the thing.
And those things are pretty common ;-/ (and do correlate, BTW).
