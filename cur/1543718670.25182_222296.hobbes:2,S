I have finally narrowed that second problem down to the 
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC flag (Local APIC support on uniprocessors). That is, 
when the flag is set to "y", ThinkPad T41 cannot wake up after APM 
standby ("apm -S" or Fn-F3). It isn't specific to 2.4.26, happens on 
other 2.4 kernels I tried, as well as on 2.6.6.
Does anybody else see this problem on similar hardware?
Thanks,
Alex
