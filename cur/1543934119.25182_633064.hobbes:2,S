Subject: Status of the h8300 port?

The h8300 port doesn't even compile anymore for some time (the
first compile error you run into was introduced 7 months ago by
commit c728d60455e8e8722ee08312a75f38dd7a866b5e).
Are there any patches in some external tree that should be merged?
Or will anyone work on getting this port back into a usable state in the 
forseeable future?
Otherwise the only reasonable option would be to remove this port from 
the kernel sources since it is dead code.
