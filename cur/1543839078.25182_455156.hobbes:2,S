I had done the same work for both ext3 and ext2,
and sent the patches to ext2-devel three months ago.
If you need, you can get them from the following URL.
The introduction for my patch set:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ext2-devel&m=114856080926308&w=2
The patch which fixes overflow problem on ext3:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ext2-devel&m=114856129220863&w=2
The patch which fixes overflow problem on ext2:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=ext2-devel&m=114856135120693&w=2
I have reviewed your patch and found other place which might
cause overflow as below.  If group_first_block is the first block of
the last group, overflow will occur.  This has already been fixed
in my patch.
o ext3_try_to_allocate_with_rsv() in fs/ext3/balloc.c
	if ((my_rsv->rsv_start >= group_first_block + EXT3_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb))
		    || (my_rsv->rsv_end < group_first_block))
			BUG();
Cheers, Takashi
