It's a notifier chain that gets called at several points during the 
suspend transition.  One of those points is right at the start, while 
userspace is still running and reasonably large amounts of memory can 
be allocated.
Is it fine-grained enough?  I don't know -- hard to tell, since nothing 
much is using it yet.

What old API do you mean?

No.  Registering new drivers is okay, registering new devices is bad.
Of course, some modules do want to register a new device in their init 
method.  I don't know what we should do about them.  Force the 
registration to fail, I suppose.  How often will people suspend while a 
module is loading?

Why should the error handler wake up?  There isn't supposed to be any 
I/O going on, hence no errors to handle.
