Hi Marcelo!
Hi Trond!
kernel 2.4.22-pre7 with
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
CONFIG_ROOT_NFS=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD=y
and boot options:   "root=/dev/marcelo ro"
-------------------------------------------------
Root-NFS: No NFS server available, giving up.                                    
VFS: Unable to mount root fs via NFS, trying floppy.                             
VFS: Insert root floppy and press ENTER                      			 
...
do I need to say more?
best,
Herbert
PS: still waiting for a really good explanation,
    why the fix and the patches are not welcome.
