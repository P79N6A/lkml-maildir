Subject: [PATCH 14/52] CRED: Provide a writeback credentials record
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/12/237

Provide a set of credentials specifically for the writeback functions.  Since
writeback may well occur in some other process context than the original write
into the pagecache, the current process's credentials are not applicable, and
so there are used instead.
If writeback needs to know the credentials, then those credentials should be
cached by prepare_write(), page_mkwrite() or similar.  Filesystems such as NFS
and AFS need to do this as they need to communicate to a remote store the
appropriate security details under which the write should be made.
Filesystems such as Ext3 should perform allocation and reservation checks
before letting the write to the pagecache occur.
