This is a nice idea, but I'm working to get rid of 'struct class_device'
from the tree.  Network devices have already been converted, the patch
is in the -mm tree, I'm working on some firewire fixes before pushing it
to Linus.
So, I think you want to do this work for 'struct device' too, as that is
what will be the real user of this code.
thanks,
