We're completely blind unless we can see that oops info.  If it reached
/var/log/messages then please send it.
If it didn't please set up netconsole (Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt)
If for some reason that isn't possible then you couldry switching to
the vga concole (alt-ctl-F1) before the ooops and see if the output
is visible on the VGA screen.  If it is there, a digital photo will suit
(you can email it to me and I can stick it on a server somewhere if
you like).  The last option is to write the oops info down with a
pencil and type it in again, but that's painful (all the hex addresses
in the stack backtrace can be omitted)
Thanks.
