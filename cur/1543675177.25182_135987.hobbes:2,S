Are you using htree?  Run
	dumpe2fs -h /dev/hda1 | grep features
and if it says "dir_index" then try turning it off:
	tune2fs -O ^dir_index /dev/hda1
and reboot.
If it is not an htree problem (and htree seems pretty stable now) then
possibly the IO system has lost some data.  If possible, try using a normal
old disk (no RAID).
Falling back to ext2 for a while would be interesting.
