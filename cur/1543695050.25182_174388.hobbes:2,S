They were proposed for 2.4, a while back, and rejected. In part due to
the fact that these option aren't widely tested on kernel code.

You can't use FP code in the kernel.

You're reading into this far too much.

Your proposed change is in part already vetoed (for sound reasons)
for 2.4, and is already included in the development branch
(where such a far-reaching change should be tested). The other part
of your proposal is completely bogus as far as the kernel is concerned.
No amount of 'threats' are going to change this.
