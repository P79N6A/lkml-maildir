Subject: [PATCH] Crystal cs4235 mixer

Greetings all:
The very short patch below fixes improper setup of the mixer on Crystal
soundcards with the CS4235 chip.  It applies against 2.4.26 and other recent
2.4.X kernels.  I haven't tried it against 2.6.X.
Please CC me directly at jparmele at wildbear point com as I am no longer
subscribed to the list.
Best regards,
