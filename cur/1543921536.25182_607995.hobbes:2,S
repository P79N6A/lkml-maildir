Subject: [PATCH] Include kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation in i386 and x86-64 Kconfig.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

To get the kernel compiled with instrumentation turned on, I had to
apply the patch below. 
It looks to me like x86 and x86-64 were just left out when the
Kconfig.instrumentation file was created, but maybe I am
misunderstanding how the x86/x86-64 merge is supposed to work.
