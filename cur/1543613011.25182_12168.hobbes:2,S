Ahh, sometimes it's hard to gauge "understanding" on this list  ;-)
Good idea BTW. For a while we looked into using those cards
to implement a non-cc NUMA cluster system. That was a while
ago, however, and I've managed to forget most of the details. Also,
with the assimilation of DG into EMC I've tossed most of my dolphin
specs.

Yes, I spent many hours in the lab hunting for signal integrity
issues. As you may guess it was not always easy being a third
party agent on an intel bus...

As I said above I tossed by P2B spec so I cant refresh my memory
on this. Did this work like reflective memory or do you scribble
on a piece of memory and then poke the card to send to another node?
Its my guess that the former prohibits the memory being cacheable
while the latter relies on compliant SW and therefore doesnt afford
transparent cross node memory references. Are either of these right?

Wish that I was but sadly I'm not. DG was my first job after grad school
and cutting my teeth on the ccNUMA stuff was simply an outstanding
experience.
Those were good days....
Thanks for the reply...
john
ps. I got two of the older PCI cards sitting in my desk drawer.
Now you've got me considering pulling those guys out and having
some fun!!!
