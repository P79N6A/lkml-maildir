You might be right that Linux and LSM are better served by this, but
this has to be used by more than just Linux. Solaris has the new FMAC
initiative (The F is silent) which will probably want to use this as
well. SEBSD/SEDarwin also has a use for this and they have a MAC label
concept in their OS with a system call for getting/setting it.

It seems your argument is against using xattrs. Regardless of this hook
the 0 xattr LSM is still borked by this. security_inode_getsecurity(...,
suffix, ...). It is assumed that the fundamental function for getting
security information takes an xattr suffix. Don't bother responding to
this email eventually you will get to the one where I agree with you on
some points.
