Never arrived here :-(. (Pleas cc me, since I'm not on this lists ...)

I can't set the videomode for the driver ...? I tried:
video=sis:vesa:0x112
video=sis:xres:640,yres:480,depth:32
video=sis,xres:640,yres:480,depth:32
Is there another way to tell the fb driver what mode to use??
I set the shared memory size from 16MB to 64 MB: results:
  sisfb: framebuffer at 0xe0000000, mapped to 0xc8800000, size 65536k
  sisfb: MMIO at 0xefce0000, mapped to 0xcc801000, size 128k
  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address cc8002e0
old results:
  sisfb: framebuffer at 0xe0000000, mapped to 0xcb800000, size 16384k
  sisfb: MMIO at 0xefce0000, mapped to 0xcc801000, size 128k
  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address cc800180
(Maybe some typo somewhere ??)
PS: I have more free time the next days -> shorter latency and more kernel
source read time ...
