No, please please please don't do these things.
vmalloc() is NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOULD EVER USE! It's only valid for when
you _need_ a big array, and you don't have any choice. It's slow, and it's
a very restricted resource: it's a global resource that is literally
restricted to a few tens of megabytes. It should be _very_ carefully used.
There are basically no valid new uses of it. There's a few valid legacy
users (I think the file descriptor array), and there are some drivers that
use it (which is crap, but drivers are drivers), and it's _really_ valid
only for modules. Nothing else.
Basically: if you think you need more memory than a kmalloc() can give,
you need to re-organize your data structures. To either not need a big 
area, or to be able to allocate it in chunks.
