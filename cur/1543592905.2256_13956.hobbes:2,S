	Pardon, but that still seems broken to me.  USER_HZ shouldn't
matter to the architecture either.  I would think that if
'echo 10 > /proc/foo/icmp_foo' sets a timeout of 10ms on alpha, it
should also do so on x86, sparc, and mips.  Why should the userspace
implementation *ever* have to know the 'architecture HZ', the 'real HZ'
or anything of the kind?
