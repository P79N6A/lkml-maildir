Hi again,
I just got the same problem with the new driver version.
The log shows, for the first timeout error:
May 15 21:37:35 localhost dhcpcd[444]: DHCP_NAK server response received 
May 15 21:37:35 localhost dhcpcd[444]: DHCP_NAK server response received 
May 15 21:37:35 localhost kernel: eth0: reset did not complete in 10 ms.
May 15 21:37:35 localhost kernel: eth0: reset finished after 10005 
microseconds.May 15 21:38:09 localhost kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: 
transmit timed out
May 15 21:38:09 localhost kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status 0000, 
PHY status 782d, resetting...
so now I'm thinking this could be caused by dhcpd. If for example
the IP address assigned to eth0 changes how would dhcpd go about
actually carrying out the change?
I'm adding some more printk's to get at trace of 
open()/close()/ioctl()/get_stats() calls to the via-rhine driver
to try to get a better picture of the problem.
