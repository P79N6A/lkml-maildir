Subject: [PATCH] Networking: re-fix of doc-comment in sock.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/18/40

From: Paul Bonser <misterpib@gmail.com>
Restoring old, correct comment for sk_filter_release, moving it to where it should actually be, and changing new comment into proper comment for sk_filter_rcu_free, where it actually makes sense.
The original fix submitted for this on Oct 23 mistakenly documented the wrong function.
