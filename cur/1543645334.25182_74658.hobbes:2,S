2.4.19 SCSI error handling leaves a lot to be desired currently.  I have
a growing pile of patches that fix up that mess.  They are/have been having
an airing on linux-scsi.
Unfortunately, Alan seems to be ignoring those which linux-scsi is happy
with for unknown reasons currently, so I haven't sent them to Marcelo
(even the ones linux-scsi have said should go to Marcelo; I'd prefer them
to get an airing and some feedback from elsewhere first.)
