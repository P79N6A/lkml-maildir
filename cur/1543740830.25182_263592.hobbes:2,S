Do you even know anything about the above?

Oh good.

Wow! That's quality there. Do you model your testing process on SCO
directly? i.e. can I have you go on record that your testing process
is satisfied after two days of testing?

Please do keep me aprised of this Jeff. I am quite certain that my
readers will find your anecdotes more than amusing.

Will you offer that as an undertaking, properly signed and sealed,
though? If these unfortunate sections of code are removed, will you
guarantee SCO won't sue?

But elsewhere you said:

Since this came up in this week's LWN kernel page (you really should
read LWN, it's filled with fascinating content and even features a
special discussion relating to your posting), one simply must ask -
how did you remove code that you do not understand? I really
absolutely want to know how this is possible, because if you have
found a technique for doing this then we can farm off all the really
complex cleanups to MCSE qualified technicians to do instead. This
would save core kernel developers unnecessary hassle and free up their
time to consider your offer in further levels of detail.

Can you guarantee that?
Jon.
