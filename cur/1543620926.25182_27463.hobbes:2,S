Haven't seen any discussion of these yet, so here goes the latest
laundry list.  Patches not offered here: I'm in way over my head,
but you'll note that doesn't keep me from mentioning things I've
explored :-).
linux/drivers/usb/storage/datafab.c:
linux/drivers/usb/storage/jumpshot.c:
	several instances of "memcpy(... sg[sg_idx].address ..." where
	"address" is no longer a valid structure member.  I saw
	similar things in the 2.5.4 patch suggesting that a fix
	might be "memcpy(... page_address(sg[sg_idx].page) ..."
linux/drivers/sound/dmabuf.c:
linux/drivers/char/drm/i810_dma.c:
linux/drivers/video/vesafb.c:
	virt_to_bus() has gone bye-bye.  Compiler suggests using
	the pci_map routines in this context.  Don't know how to
	proceed.
linux/drivers/md/lvm.c:
	A couple of things here.  lvm_get_blksize() should be
	block_size().  This one has been mentioned before.
	The other problem is a reference to current->sigpending.
	A possible fix is to replace "if (current->sigpending != 0)"
	with "if (signal_pending(current))".
linux/arch/i386/kernel/process.c:
linux/include/asm-i386/processor.h:
	Patch set previously provided by someone else for returning
	saved PC of a blocked thread.
linux/fs/intermezzo/super.c:
	read_super --> get_sb conversion not done for this filesystem.
	This one is more difficult than the patches I saw for other
	filesystems, because presto_read_super() calls
	fstype->read_super().
