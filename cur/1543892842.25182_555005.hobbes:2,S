OK, the change of hung_up_tty_ioctl() from locked to unlocked
is not necessary for this patch. On the surface it seemed a clever
way of not needing two different functions to do the same simple:
return cmd == TIOCSPGRP ? -ENOTTY : -EIO;
which does not need any locking for its own sake. But clearly
the hangup behavior requires the locked version.
I'll redo the patch with hung_up_tty_ioctl remaining locked.
That will separate the compat ioctl stuff from this issue.
