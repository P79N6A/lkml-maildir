Oh dear.  This is a good demonstration of the downside of trying to use
compiler bitfields to represent hardware registers.  I have vague memories
of writing BFINS and BFEXT in 3c59x to stomp this problem.
I don't think there's any guarantee that the code you have there will work
on all architectures/compiler versions btw.
Also...  The code appears to be assuming that BE architectures will
bit-reverse their bitfields.  Is that right?  I'd expect them to only
byte-reverse them?
IOW:
   31 30 ... 15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
   |--------------- dma_address0 --------------------|
                                                       | dma_0No_update
                                                          | dma_0start
versus
   31 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 ... 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
   |--------------| dma_address0
                           |---- more of dma_address0 -----|
                     | dma_0No_update
                        | dma_0start
or something like that...  Brain hurts.
