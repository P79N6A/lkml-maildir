Yes, however this must be limited to a small number of privileged
applications - iopl() is only available to CAP_SYS_RAWIO IIRC,
and thus it's not suitable for general use.

There is really no reason to do that, since the time to read it (~1200
ns) is much less than the time to enter the kernel (less than 200 ns),
so gettimeofday() is definitely easier to use and also doesn't overflow.
