well, I looked at it in a geometro-topological way, i.e. assumed that "in
the universe of negative off_t offsets, the large (but useful)
loff_t offsets are compactified into a single point 0" and as for errors
"as long as we stay away from the singularity -1 we are okay and the
resulting offset 0 is *not* an error, it is just weirdly mapped from a
different manifold" ;)
