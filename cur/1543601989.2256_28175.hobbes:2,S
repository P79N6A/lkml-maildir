But the _reason_ is that the action message does not carry a new line.

A whole lot of basic testing was done. The locking and the tables and
the registration all work correctly. I screwed up the loglevel stuff,
and it took 6 months for anyone to notice. Some people think that the
registration functions should be valid to call even when
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ is not defined, but this is a style thing.
Waving your hands and saying "Why wasn't this tested!!!" over and over
is annoying, and doesn't accomplish anything.

No. go_sync() and do_emergency_sync() should NOT make assumptions about
the nature of console_loglevel, they should behave as they have been.
The commingling of loglevel settings was wrong in the first place.
