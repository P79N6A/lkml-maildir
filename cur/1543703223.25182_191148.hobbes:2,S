Paul M suggested (in the 32-bit display loop of lib/mask.c):
> #define BITMAP_WORD(p, n)	(((u32 *)(p))[(n) ^ 1])
Then, later, Joe sugguested a patch rewriting the lib/mask.c display
loop using various C bit operations (& ! / % << >>).
Joe - question - is there any good reason not to use Paul M's
suggestion, eor'ing the index with 1 on 64 bit big endian hardware?
I have a patch about ready (as soon as I can get time on my big system
to test it) that uses the eor 1 idea.
The eor 1 code looks good to me, and takes a few bytes fewer machine
instructions.  Perhaps you know something I am missing.  The actual
patch should be up in about 5 hours, in case you'd rather not comment on
code unseen ;).
Joe suggested:

On further review, I think you're right on this, Joe.  After I get the
above big endian fix out, I will attempt a patch that changes this
format, zero-filling each word to 8 hex chars, from:

 * Examples:
 *   A mask with just bit 0 set displays as "1".
 *   A mask with just bit 127 set displays as "80000000,0,0,0".
 *   A mask with just bit 64 set displays as "1,0,0".
 *   A mask with bits 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 set displays
 *     as "1,1,10117".  The first "1" is for bit 64, the second
 *     for bit 32, the third for bit 16, and so forth, to the
 *     "7", which is for bits 2, 1 and 0.
 *   A mask with bits 32 through 39 set displays as "ff,0".

How does that look to you?  Anyone else want to chime in?
