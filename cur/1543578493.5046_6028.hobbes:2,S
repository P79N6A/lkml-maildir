Hi all
This is somewhat odd, but I seemed to have found some kind of bug in
2.4.0. I  tested the same program in 2.2.17 and it run perfectly.
So, here goes the description:
2.4.0 Kernel hangs up when I do the following stuff:
	* Create a new PTY using openpty();
	* Fork using forkpty. Now, the child process does this:
		- Set the fd 0 line discipline to PPP;
		- tries infinitely to read the standard input.
	The parent process sets the line discipline of the master PTY fd to PPP
also, and then writes to it.
When I say it hangs up I really mean it. Not even the SYSRQ works.
