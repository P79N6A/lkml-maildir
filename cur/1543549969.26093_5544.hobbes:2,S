<p>That will teach me to play fast and loose with checking error returns
from system calls. I wasnt specifying a mode when creating the files.
<br>So they were being created without user write permission..
<br>I dont know why it worked under 2.4.0. Maybe a kernel bug :-).
<p>Anyway, a new version is available now at <A HREF="
