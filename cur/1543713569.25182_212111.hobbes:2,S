Ok.

Unfortunatelly this is not as easy to do, though I believe there is just some
sort or race on unload that is not being hit until module is unloaded and
therefore it is completely not related.

There I have ECC RAM, passed 14 days of memtest (yes, I know memtest uses
only 1 CPU), so I do not think I have memory problems, though this is not
absolute guarantee against that of course.
Also running in UP mode for weeks is not all that funny and still proves nothing
as I do not have clear way to reproduce it in certain time.

Well, I had a hang before this oops and that was main reason I enabled NMI
watchdog. At that first hang nothing get to serial console so I guessed
it was similar spinlock deadlock.
We'll see what I get when another NMI watchdog thing occurs. I run
with spinlock debug this time, so hopefully if spinlock is really just
corrupted, its magic would be corrupted as well and I get clear warning about
that.
Thank you.
