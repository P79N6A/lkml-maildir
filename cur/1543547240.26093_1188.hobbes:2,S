attention everyone,
the assumption that people who use raid or nfs always use a patched kernel
is not true.
in many cases it is not trivial to find the newest patches and tools to go
with them (documentation limitations) and in other cases the stock stuff
seems to work so people don't realize there is a reason to upgrade.
