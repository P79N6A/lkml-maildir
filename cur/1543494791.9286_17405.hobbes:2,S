Look at the implementation of "cli()" - when called from within a hardware
interrupt, it will do something else than what you think it's doing, and
"synchronize_irq()" will basically be a no-op.

Bogus. It won't really harm (see no-op above), but it certainly doesn't
help either.

Again, that one looks like it shouldn't actually harm anything, but
doesn't help.
For the REAL uses, look at some of the SCSI and sound drivers:
	outb(~0, s->ioenh + SV_CODEC_INTMASK);  /* disable ints */
	synchronize_irq();
where the point of synchronize_irq() is to just wait for current
interrupts to exit, because we just asked the card to not send any new
ones. 
That's still not necessarily a good practice (see my previous email about
asynchroneity wrt CPU/device models), but at least it's not a silly no-op
like the ones you looked at.
