Other files should not be stored in the same page though - if that's
happening today, then we have a violation of POSIX, wrong from Linus'
"quality of implementation" standpoint, and its a security hole.

Hmm, you're right here.  I wonder whether we could allow VM_SHARED to be
set on such mappings, thereby putting the pages on the i_mmap_shared
list rather than the i_mmap list.
The alternative is that we scan these two lists for every case which we
need to do something; this seems to make the split lists rather pointless
from an architecture implementors point of view.
Maybe some of the VM gurus can shed some more light on this subject?
