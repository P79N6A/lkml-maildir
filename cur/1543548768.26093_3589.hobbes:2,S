According to Richard B. Johnson:

Yes, sessions, process groups, and controlling ttys are weird
and hard to understand. And probably braindamaged as well, if
not, it's what they cause anyway ;)
If you want to forcibly get a controlling tty:
/* Make sure we do not have a controlling tty. */
ioctl(0, TIOCNOTTY, 0);
close(0);
close(1);
close(2);
/* Become session leader */
setsid();
/* Open tty which will become new controlling tty. */
open("/dev/tty1", O_RDWR);
dup(0);
dup(0);
/* Just to be sure, force controlling tty, in case /dev/tty1
   was the ctty for another process. Only root may do this! */
ioctl(0, TIOCSCTTY, 1);
Mike.
