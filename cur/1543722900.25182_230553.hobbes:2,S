Subject: [PATCH] __alloc_bootmem_node should not panic when it fails
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

__alloc_bootmem_node currently panics if it cant satisfy an allocation
for a particular node. Thats rather antisocial, we should at the very
least return NULL and allow the caller to proceed (eg try another node).
A quick look at alloc_bootmem_node usage suggests we should fall back to
allocating from other nodes if it fails (as arch/alpha/kernel/pci_iommu.c
and arch/x86_64/kernel/setup64.c do).
The following patch does that. We fall back to the regular
__alloc_bootmem when __alloc_bootmem_node fails, which means all other
nodes are checked for available memory.
