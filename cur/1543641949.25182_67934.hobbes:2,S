If I understand the code in sched.c correctly, the dynamic prio [-5...5]
is calculated using sleep_avg, but the name is deceiving, it's more like
the edge of a knife.  If a process is sleeping, its sleep_avg is
incremented by one per timer tick, and if it is running it is decremented
by one per timer tick.  This means (for a periodic task) that if it sleeps
for less than 50% of the timer ticks, it will get a sleep_avg of zero
(dynamic prio +5), and if it is sleeping for more than 50%, it will get a 
sleep_avg of MAX_SLEEP_AVG (dynamic prio -5).
For the case of a game server, this means that when the CPU utilization 
gets above 50% (roughly), it will switch from -5 to +5 in dynamic priority 
in a few seconds and stay there until the CPU utilization drops under 50%.
Is my analysis correct, and is this what we want?
Have you experimented with other averaging algorithms?

I tried that yesterday (without the O(1) scheduler), and it does wonders
for the in-game latency (i.e. ping).  I suppose that the dynamic prio will
still be +5 at 70% CPU utilization even with a HZ of 1000 using the O(1)  
scheduler.  Why would it make a difference?
