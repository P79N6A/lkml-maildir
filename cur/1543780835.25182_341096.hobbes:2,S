Subject: IBM HDAPS - how to freeze i/o?

The HDAPS (IBM ThinkPad Hard Disk Active Protection System) project 
currently has working code to read the accelerometer data, and to park 
the hard disk.
However, we're going to need a way to keep the disk idle following the 
park command, as any subsequent command reaching the disk may reactivate 
the drive before it's safe to resume.
Is there any mechanism available in the kernel to 'freeze' the i/o queue?
Thanks,
Jon.
