that is a cool reference! So i'd suggest to do (redo?) the patch based 
on those concepts and that terminology and not use 'queued spinlocks' 
that are commonly associated with MS's stuff. And as a result the 
contended case would be optimized some more via local-spin algorithms. 
(which is not a key thing for us, but which would be nice to have 
nevertheless)
