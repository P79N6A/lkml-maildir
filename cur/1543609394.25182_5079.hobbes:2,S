I have now a nice kernel at home, compiled with -mredparm=3 up
and going. Full interactive session, full kernel compiles working,
X11 whatsup. Everything seems fine so far.
However I still have to build a RPM-feature grade kernel and test it.
Further the precise benchmarking will take some time as well.
I think that I will in esp. use the byte benchmark, since it is 
quite "kernel intensive" at some parts. Patch will follow on
monday (if nothing comes in between...).
