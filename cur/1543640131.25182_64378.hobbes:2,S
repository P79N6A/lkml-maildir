Right. I wasn't saying that NFSv4 doesn't have anything going for
it. Just that Kerberos isn't the killer argument: it can easily be
integrated with earlier versions of NFS (and in fact Andy and I had
the basic Linux version running on NFSv3 in February *before* it was
tested for NFSv4).
IMHO the main argument for NFSv4 is the improved support for WANs.
Cheers,
