Sorry, I should've explained a little more.
pdev->name is the platform device name, which is just the <name> part.
pdev->dev.bus_id is the device model name, which is <name><instance-number>,
and the devices are known by this name.
Rather than going to the trouble of parsing <name> from the device model
name which would be inherently buggy, we reference it directly from the
platform_device structure.
So, this comment needs updating:
 *      So, extract the <name> from the device, and compare it against
 *      the name of the driver. Return whether they match or not.
