I think there is some amount of blocking allowed.  But that has not be
clearly defined.  Note in 2.5.x there is a specific subset
of the reboot notifiers the shutdown() device method.  That you
don't need to register a notifier for.  The rules are the same
and it is just a little bit cleaner.

And this a reserved hunk of memory from of memory from say 16MB to 20MB
would handle.  As the DMA could never have been setup at that address
it obviously will never be used...
