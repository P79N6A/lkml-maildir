I've got a problem with my 2.4.2-2 kernel.
after reaching the power down stage i get a :
1. complete listing of the cpu registers
2. a message saying sementaion fault with halt -i -p -d
i contacted the author of the poweroff script but
he says that this means it must be a kernel problem
i know that the kernel is old but i dont want to update
cos my modem has a low download speed
also i cant give u the complete listing of the cpu
registers since it occurs at the last stage
of shutdown and i cant copy it to a file
and am too lazy to write it down
can anyone help me ?
Anant
