Subject: [PATCH] ppc64 need HPAGE_SHIFT when huge pages disabled

With the new powerpc architecture we don't seem to be able to disable
huge pages anymore.
    mm/built-in.o(.toc1+0xae0): undefined reference to `HPAGE_SHIFT'
    make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
We seem to need to define HPAGE_SHIFT to something when HUGETLB_PAGE isn't
defined.  This patch defines it to 0 when we have no support.
How does this look?  Against 2.6.15-rc1-mm1.
