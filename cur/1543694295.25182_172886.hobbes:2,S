Okay, its official.  My brain isn't working.
The different kernels were tested on two different machines.  The one 
running 2.4 is *just* enough slower that the packets start to pile up 
and end up waiting in the socket buffer.  By slowing down the packet 
sending I get results that are invariant with the number of packets.
Sorry for the false alarm guys....
