I am not suggesting a single solution for all needs.  I wanted to
focus only one aspect: the marking of those points in the kernel where
something probeworthy occurs with hooks.  The different tools would
still gather and disseminate their data in their own favorite.  The
main difference from the status quo is agreeing on and reusing a
common pool of hooks.
