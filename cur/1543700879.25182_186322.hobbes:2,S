DBT-2 and PostgreSQL 7.4 is finally working with LVM2 at 100 and 200
warehouse scale factors on 8-processor system in STP with 40 drives (38
managed under LVM), but not without a few catches. I have written up
some brief instructions on how to execute the test successfully with the
Linux-2.6.0 stable release:

The instructions also cover how to get oprofile annoted assembly source
in the test results.  Feel free to ask any questions.
