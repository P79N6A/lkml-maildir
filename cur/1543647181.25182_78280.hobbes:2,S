 When using shared libraries, is there a ".section" into which
 I can put a variable that's writable? I note that when programs
 that use shared libraries start, the pages are mprotect(ed)
 PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, but sometimes I see PROT_WRITE on some
 pages.
 
 I'd like to rip out a memory-mapped semiphore and put it directly
 in a shared library if possible.
 
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
