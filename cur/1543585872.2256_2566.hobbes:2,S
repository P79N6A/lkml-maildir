K6-2 500, the MB is a Super 7, Tyan S1590S-100.
It is a VIA Apollo 3 (MVP3) AGPset chipset, only goes up to DMA/33.
The drive is a 10G Western Digital, output from the kernel on boot up below.
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
VP_IDE: chipset revision 6
VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c586b (rev 47) IDE UDMA33 controller on pci00:07.1
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xe000-0xe007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
hda: WDC WD102AA, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: 20044080 sectors (10263 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=1247/255/63, UDMA(33)
If I've left anything out just ask.
