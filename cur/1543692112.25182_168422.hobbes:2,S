Hi,
not sure if this is the right list to try, but I have tried a few now
and not found an answer to my problem so I thought I would just give
this a shot. 
I have just installed 2.4.20-20.9 kernel on my RH9 machine. At boot up,
it gets as far through rc.sysinit to try to e2fsck / and then halts with
the error:
Checking root filesystem
/dev/hda3 is mounted. e2fsck: Cannont continue, aborting.
The command just before this error is :
initlog -c 'fsck -T -a -C /'
it exits with a return code of 8 (operational error)
boot loader is grub, and the stanza's look identical. I used the rpm
version of the kernel so it was all pretty much done for me. I haven't
yet tried compiling my own kernel because I wanted to sort out this
problem first.
I also have the old kernel still available and it boots without error.
Could you please tell me where I can read about fixing this problem, or
maybe some things I can try?
Thanks, gillian
