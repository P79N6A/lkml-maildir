Hi guys,
I just upgraded my kernel from 2.0.36 to 2.2.4  (i386)
As far as the kernel and modules are concerned everything 
seems fine (at least for now). 
The only problem I had is with lilo. With the new kernel it does
not behave the same way.
Here is what happened:
I changed my /etc/lilo.conf file to set the new kernel as default
and here is the msg I got:
>bash# /sbin/lilo
>Warning: device 0x0805 exceeds 1024 cylinder limit
>geo_comp_addr: Cylinder number is too big (3085 > 1023)     
However, if I boot the system with the older kernel (2.0.36)
lilo works fine.
I'm not sure what is going on, I just wanted to let you know
about this issue.
By the way, I didn't try any other 2.2.x kernels,
so I'm not sure whether it's 2.2.4 specific.
take care
gp
