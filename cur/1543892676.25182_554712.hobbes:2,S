What about patches?
Anyway, by agreement (with myself), i've stopped on having per-file-name
division (prev. message first patch, and that was last design remaining
from cleanfile/cleanpatch). So:
for f in $*
do clean-whitespace $f 2>&1 >/dev/null
done
But this doesn't look like interactive usage, which i've concluded.
Plus copy is saved in $f.clean file, so user can `diff -u` to see any
destruction and possibly report a bug.

What i've done was `cleanpatch patch-2.6.21-rc4-rc5`
That's where usefulness comes from ;)
