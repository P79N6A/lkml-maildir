You should have tried this first :) :
$ make | cat
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/roman/src/linux-lkc/scripts'
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/roman/src/linux-lkc/scripts'
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/roman/src/lc'
make[1]: `conf' is up to date.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/roman/src/lc'
./scripts/lkc/conf -s arch/i386/config.new
#
# using defaults found in .config
#
*
* Restart config...

Enable loadable module support (MODULES) [Y/n/?] y
  Set version information on all module symbols (MODVERSIONS) [N/y/?] (NEW) aborted!
Console input/output is redirected. Run 'make oldconfig' to update configuration.
make: *** [include/linux/autoconf.h] Error 1
