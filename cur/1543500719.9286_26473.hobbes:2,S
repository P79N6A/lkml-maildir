Brandon,
That was my intent, actually-to help at both the requirements stage and
the design stage.  We've got a lot of posts here about different design
and performance aspects of layered trees and albods, etc., but I have
yet to see someone lay out exactly what the changes visible to the
user and programmer will be, and why they're worth the effort.
I'm NOT saying that this project isn't worthwhile; with my schedule, I
haven't the time or the inclination to get involved with half the things
that
I think have merit, let alone the ones that don't.  But I do think it is
critical that this effort be focused at least a little more, especially if
it will result in changes to the kernel.
Lou

I don't think we're at that point yet --- it's hard to write a design
document when you don't have an agreed-upon set of objectives yet....
What might be useful would be a summary document listing the various ideas
that have gone by, with pointers to the messages expounding them (via links
to kernel list archives).  Possibly that would help avoid the
devfs-thread-ish "is everyone talking about the same thing?" problem.
