So we're doing a get_page() on a random page which could be in any state -
it could be on the freelists, or in the per-cpu pages arrays, it could have
been reused for something else.
There's code in the kernel which assumes that we don't do that sort of
thing.  For example:
static inline int page_is_buddy(struct page *page, int order)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE
	if (!pfn_valid(page_to_pfn(page)))
		return 0;
#endif
	if (PageBuddy(page) && page_order(page) == order) {
		BUG_ON(page_count(page) != 0);
               return 1;
	}
       return 0;
}
