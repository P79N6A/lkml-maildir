No.  I'm simply saying that when people call atomic_read, they expect a read to 
occur.  When this doesn't happen, people get confused.  Merely referencing a 
variable doesn't carry the same connotation.
Anyway, I'm taking Linus's advice and putting the cast in atomic_read(), rather 
than the counter declaration itself.  Everything else uses __asm__ __volatile__, 
or calls atomic_read() with interrupts disabled.  This ensures that 
atomic_read() works as expected across all architectures, without the cruft the 
compiler generates when you declare the variable itself volatile.

Not necessarily.  Some code uses atomic_t for a sort of lightweight semaphore. 
If your loop is actually doing real work, perhaps in a softirq handler 
negotiating shared resources with a hard irq handler, you're not busy-waiting.

a) No, and that's sort of the point.  We shouldn't have to audit the whole 
kernel to find cases where a misleadingly-named function is doing what its users 
are not expecting.  If we can make it always do the right thing without any 
substantial drawbacks, we should.
b) Loops are just one case, which came to mind because of the IPVS bug recently 
discussed.  I recall seeing some scheduler code recently which does an 
atomic_read() twice on the same variable, with a barrier in between.  It's in a 
very hot path, so if we can remove that barrier, we save a bunch of register 
loads.  When you're context switching every microsecond in SCHED_RR, that really 
matters.
