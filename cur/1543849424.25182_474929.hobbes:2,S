Subject: [CFT] Grep to find users of sys_sysctl.

Anyone who is interested in knowing if they have an application on
their system that actually uses sys_sysctl please run the following grep.
find / -type f  -perm /111 -exec fgrep 'sysctl@@GLIBC' '{}' ';' 
The -perm /111 is an optimization to only look at executable files,
and may be omitted if you are patient.
Currently I don't expect anyone to find a match anywhere except in libpthreads,
if you find any others please let me know.
Eric
