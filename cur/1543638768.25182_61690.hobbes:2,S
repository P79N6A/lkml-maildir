	Would you mind sending those patches to me so that I can push
them toward 2.5.X at my next update ? I would hate to do the same job
twice. Thanks...
	Also : I'm planning to dump some of my IrDA patch queue to
Marcelo real soon. I would hate to see my bug fixes colliding with
your cosmetic changes. Could you tell me the status of those fixes
with respect to Marcelo ?
	Thanks...
	Jean
