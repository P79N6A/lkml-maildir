Ah, here I disagree, it is possible to do (hard) realtime scheduling
over multiple cpus, the only draw back is that it requires a very strong
load-balancer, making it unsuitable for large number of cpus.
( of course, having a strong rt load balancer on a large cpuset doesn't
  harm, as long as there are no rt tasks to balance )
So if we have a system like so:
             __A__
            /  |  \
          B1  B2  B3
          /\
         /  \
       C1   C2
A comprises of cpus 0-127, !SD_LOAD_BALANCE
B1 comprises of cpus 0-63, !SD_LOAD_BALANCE
B2 comprises of cpus 64-119
B3                   120-127
C1                   0-3
C2                   5-63
We end up with 4 disjoint load-balanced sets.
I would then attach the rt balance information to: C1, C2, B2, B3.
If, for example, B1 would be load-balanced, we'd only have 3 disjoint
sets left: B1, B2 and B3, and the rt balance data would be there.

So, I don't think we need that, I think we can do with the single flag,
we just need to find these disjoint sets and stick our rt-domain there.
