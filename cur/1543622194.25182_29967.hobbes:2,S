I've seen this one before. It seems to kick in at 11K processes, where
one would normally expect it much higher... so I'm not sure a constant
upper bound on that counter suffices. Maybe clashes of pid's with pgrp's
and sessions and tgrps are what does that, maybe it's something else.
and of course:
#include <stdgeek.h>  /* Any hope of a non-O(tasks) solution? */
Cheers,
