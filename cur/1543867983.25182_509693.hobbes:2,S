There's always an issue when two people work on the same driver ... it
causes patch conflicts, which is why we try to avoid it where we can.

I don't quite see how this is relevant to the readability issue?

This again, doesn't really address the argument.  I'm saying I'd rather
not have confusion over what types to use in the driver.  You're saying
that if you only check the value for truth or falsehood it should be a
boolean.  That's actually worse than I was anticipating because you're
now saying that single bit bitfields may or may not be booleans
depending on use.  This looks like worse potential for confusion than
before.
