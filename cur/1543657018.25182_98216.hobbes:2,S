My experiences to add to the pot...I started by booting 2.5.52-mm2 and 
launching KDE3. I have a dual AMD MP2000+, 1GB RAM, with most of the 
data used below on striped/RAID0 ATA/133 drives. Taking Andrew's 
advice, I created a continuous load with:
    while [ 1 ]; do ( make -j4 clean; make -j4 bzImage ); done
...in a kernel tree, then sat down for a leisurely email and web 
cruising session. After about fifteen minutes, it became apparent I 
wasn't suffering any interactive slowdown. So I increased the load:
    while [ 1 ]; do ( make -j8 clean; make -j8 bzImage ); done
    while [ 1 ]; do ( cp dump1 dump2; rm dump2; sync ); done
...where file "dump1" is 100MB. Now we're seeing some impact :) 
 To combat this I tried:
    echo 3000 > starvation_limit
    echo 4 > interactive_delta
    echo 200 max_timeslice
    echo 20 min_timeslice
This works pretty well. The "spinning envelope" on the email monitor 
of gkrellm actually corresponds quite nicely with the actual feel of 
my system, so after awhile, I just sat back and observed it. Both the 
tactile response and the gkrellm obervations show this: it's common 
to experience maybe a .1--.3 second lag every 2 or 3 seconds with 
this load, with maybe the odd .5 second lag occurring once or twice a 
minute. Watching the compile job in the background scroll by, I 
noticed that there are times when it comes to a dead stop. The next 
step, I guess, needs to be a ConTest with the final settings...
child_penalty: 95
exit_weight: 3
interactive_delta: 4
max_sleep_avg: 2000
max_timeslice: 300
min_timeslice: 10
parent_penalty: 100
prio_bonus_ratio: 25
starvation_limit: 3000
