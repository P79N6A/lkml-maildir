Hello!
I'm playing with iscsi on linux.
And I have following problem:
If I change lun size on target side and then do echo "1" >/sys/block/
sdb/device/rescan
device size is changed only if /dev/sdb is not mounted, if it is
mounted fdisk shows no size change, so lun can't be resized online.
open-iscsi guys say this is general linux problem, not iscsi specific.
Could you tell me is there any solution?
Thank you!
