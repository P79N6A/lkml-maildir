	Although I am curious about what you had in mind about
dep_tristate, I no longer need to see this example to see a problem
with my patch.  My patch breaks detection of "new" variables in
arch/*/config.in by "make oldconfig."
	So, I guess something like Keith Owens's patch would be the
way to go, with some additional definitions (CONFIG_AGP, CONFIG_PCI,
CONFIG_ISA, CONFIG_EISA, CONFIG_PCMCIA, and possibly others).  I am
not sure which other conditionals might also be incorrectly ignored by
some instances of dep_xxx.  Below, I have included a list of the 52
CONFIG_* variables that are used as arguments to dep_xxx in 2.4.6-pre6
and appear in arch/*/config.in.
