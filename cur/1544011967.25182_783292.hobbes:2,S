Unless there are conflict resolutions in the linux-next tree (and there
are a few) that involve the files in the generated patch.  In that case
the patch may not apply cleanly to any of the individual trees.

Hopefully you can glean that information from the MAINTAINERS file or the
Trees file in any linux-next tree (available via git-web if not from the
tree itself).
