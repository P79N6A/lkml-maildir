That's right, yep. There is no ordering requirement, only that
the actual store and load be atomic.

I don't think it was particularly serious for PAE. Probably not
worth holding off until 2.7. We'll see.

Can't comment on a specific architecture... some may have problems.
I think i386 prepopulates pmds, so it is no problem; but generally:
I think you can get away with it if you write the "unimportant"
word(s) first, do a wmb(), then write the word containing the
present bit. I guess this has to be done this way otherwise the
hardware walker will blow up...
Of course, the hardware walker would be doing either atomic or
correctly ordered reads, while a plain dereference doesn't
guarantee anything.
I'm not sure of the history behind the code, but I would be in
favour of making _all_ pagetable access go through accessor
functions, even if nobody quite needs them yet.
