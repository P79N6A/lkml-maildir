OK, hmm.  I've got some better ideas then.  It sounds like the code to
have puts show up on VGA isn't selected/compiled in.  Or, there's still
some other problem wrt the OF transition code.  Just having a serial
console selected still doesn't give output however, right?

The simple answer is, don't use allnoconfig :).  Do a 'make
common_defconfig' and then from there turn off stuff you don't need.
