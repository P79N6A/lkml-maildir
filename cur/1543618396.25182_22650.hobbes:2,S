OK, I see.
The BIOS numbers are all mostly wrong. When you are in the BIOS config (the 
Del or ESC key thing)...;-)  The CPU is running without any IDLE cycles at 
all.

Yes, sorry. I overlooked that.

What I expect is:
+45°C CPU
The sensor under the CPU 'cause only the Morgan and Athlon XP/MP have the new 
integrated sensor but only "latest" mobos support it. Not your KT133A based 
one.
+35°C mobo (but I haven't anyone with sensor seen so far)
Could be the CPU -10°C what's sometimes the case with some mobo manufactures.
+25°C System (the case temperature)
With your system load.
An idle system should look like this:
CPU		23-25°C	(with IDLE and BUS GRANT)
system (case)	20-23°C	(room temperature)
At any time (full load) the case temperature shouldn't go over 40°C with all 
stuff running (gfx, disks, lan, etc.). Recommendations from AMD and Intel.

No, they have the frame work in place but need the usefull bits.
That's we are hunting for...

Very true!
