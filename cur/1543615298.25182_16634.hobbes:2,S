Then the best thing to do is to put a disclaimer on your
autoconfiguration program: "WARNING: autoconfigure may not detect older
hardware that was not designed for reliable detection.  If autoconfigure
fails to detect all of your hardware, you may need to manually configure
your kernel."
Sometimes perfection isn't worth the effort, especially when trying to
support a class of hardware that is rapidly becoming obsolete.  Optimize
for the most likely case, and deal with the rare corner cases with other
means.
