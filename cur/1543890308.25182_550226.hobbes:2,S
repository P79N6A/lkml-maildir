Just outlawing BUG_ON doesn't seem like a good idea to me. We'll just end
up with lots of untested and likely buggy recovery code or no asserts. Both
would be bad.

You mean goto labels? Surely goto statements are to be indented.

emacs generates one space label in front of a goto label. I wouldn't
outlaw this.

It would be probably better to define some syntax that makes it possible
to auto extract those from feature-removal-schedule.txt. Otherwise
long term this will become messy.
Possible further checks that might make sense:
- panic() anywhere in drivers/* 
- externs in .c files without asmlinkage
- general checking that everything in a fully visible {} block is the right 
indentation
