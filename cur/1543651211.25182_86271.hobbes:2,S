Bindings are cool, but once you start talking about doing a lot of
them, they're rather ungainly due to not actually being persisted on
the filesystem, no? 
A better approach is to just make a user-space capabilities-wrapper
that's setuid, drops capabilities quickly and safely and calls the
real app. Something like:
# mv ping ping.real
# chmod -s ping.real
# mkcapwrap +net_raw ping.real
# chmod +s ping
# showcapwrap ping
invokes /bin/ping
grants net_raw
#
No fs magic, no persistence issues, all user-space.
