You acked the change actually :P
I guess it was done in mainline when AS was merged.

Its quite important. If the queue is full, and AS is waiting for a process
to submit a request, its got a long wait.
Maybe a lower limit for per process nr_requests. Ie. you may queue if this
queue has less than 128 requests _or_ you have less than 8 requests
outstanding. This would solve my problem. It would also give you a much more
appropriate scaling for server workloads, I think. Still, thats quite a
change in behaviour (simple to code though).
