True, but the nice thing about the linux kernel is that every little
detail can be modified as you like. I think it is very important to answer
the question what skills a person that wants to compile a kernel needs. If
you want to lower the threshold, this sure is an config option that
shouldn't be there.
Maybe the config system should provide an expert-mode to tweak stuff like
this, and enable / disable the irq balancing by default according to the
processor type selected.
