Software-refill TLB architectures would very much like to be handed the
largest physically contiguous chunk of memory out of pagecache possible
and map it out using the fewest number of TLB entries possible. Dropping
in a B+ tree to replace radix trees should be a weekend project at worst.
Speculatively allocating elements that are "as large as sane/possible"
will invariably result in variable-sized elements in the same tree.
