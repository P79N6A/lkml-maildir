Note that the preemptable kernel gives you no guarantee of latency,
though it does reduce the average latency.  A different patch was
constructed in the 2.4 era which attempted to provide guaranteed latency
through a different approach (effectively, having all long-running
operations yield).

All system calls execute schedule() before returning to user space, if
schedule has been requested.  It's done in the system call handler.  An
interrupt will also schedule if necessary.
In addition, if you have a preemptable kernel, schedule() may be
executed on demand at any time the kernel isn't in a critical section,
or upon exiting a critical section if it is.

The reschedule will be done whenever the kernel does it.  There is no
guaranteed worst case.  It's just based on "best effort."
If an interrupt from some device, or the timer interrupt, causes a
high-priority process to become runnable, the kernel will attempt to
schedule as soon as possible.  With a preemptable kernel, that will be
as soon as it releases all locks and can thus be safely interrupted.
But the kernel makes no guarantee that locks won't be held for long
periods of time, so the worst case latency is the longest possible
duration of an operation in the kernel.  That could be quite long (many
milliseconds) if it's walking tables, hitting worst-case hash behavior,
etc.
The thing to note about the timer is that, if you have no external
interrupt driving your wakeup, then you're waking up based on some sort
of timer.  The best resolution you can get from a timer is approximately
based on HZ.  In 2.6 kernels, the interrupt frequency is 1000hz, but
ticks are represented to userspace as if they were 100hz.  Also, you may
have an RTC available if you need high frequency interrupts.
