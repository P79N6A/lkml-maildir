Again, this works fine so long as the number of static tracepoints is
small and manageable, but it seems like there's a division between what
the subsystem developer deems as meaningful and what someone doing the
tracing might want to look at. Static tracepoints are completely
subjective, LTT proved that this was a problem regarding general
code-level intrusiveness when the number of tracepoints in relatively
close locality started piling up based on what people considered
arbitrarily useful, and LTTng doesn't appear to do anything to address
this.
This doesn't really match my definition of a neglible maintenance
burden..
