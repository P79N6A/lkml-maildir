I think Robert and I are seeing different things.  For me, -mm6 is fine
(unlike Robert's case), -mm7 oopses in the PCI init code during early
boot (somewhere in the radeon init stuff, can't capture the oops
easily), and -mm8 gives itself a wedgie a few seconds after starting X.
I'm about to try, um, whichever of the umpty-ump patches that went back
and forth looks most plausible.
