If we could invent any mechanism, it would seem that it would be nicest 
if we could have independent sequences of IO requests (say with a 
distinct tag per sequence) and an ability to issue a per sequence flush 
request.  That might tie into the QOS support, but would still have 
issues when you try to map it back up the stack through the journal and 
into application level promises of data integrity.
For example, in data journal mode, we would probably need to flush not 
only the transaction level data, but also all data sequences that had 
IO's in that transaction first.
Pretty rapidly, we start to get into the database notions of nested 
transactions and so on ;-)
