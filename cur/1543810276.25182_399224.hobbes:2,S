Well, people with broken swsusp tend to try suspend2... that's why you
see so many reports. if you merged suspend2 and dropped swsusp, it
would be the other way around.

I'm not rejecting _everything_ Nigel does, but I have seen very little
acceptable kernel patches from him.

Feel free to review suspend2 yourself. You are likely to find many
small issues, and Nigel is likely to fix them; but that's useless: as
long as big issues are not fixed, code is not suitable for mainline
merge.
(And it is going to be easier to do it in userspace using existing -mm
infrastructure then to clean suspend2 patches).
Feel free to review suspend.sf.net code if you want to help; testing
would be useful at this point, too.
