Sorry, I was too terse about the problem.  You're right, but typical
distros don't ship full kernel source in their "support kernel builds"
package.  And if I use an external build directory (ie "O=") then
the symlink just points to my external build directory, which doesn't
include the source to drivers/, just links to include/
