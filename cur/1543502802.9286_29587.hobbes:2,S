Absolutely.  The trouble is that a correct fix --- the clean way of
doing things --- is to back-port the 2.3 changes, which is obviously a
non-starter.  The only real alternative to detecting the special case is
to differentiate between writes from the page cache and writes from user
buffers when we call f_op->write(), but that is a change in the
definition of the VFS which I wanted to avoid for 2.2.  
The code paths in 2.2 simply don't let us pass information to the fs
about whether or not an update_vm_cache() is necessary or not.  Either
we check in update_vm_cache or we change the VFS definitions.  If Alan
would prefer the latter then I'm certainly willing to code it that way,
but it will be incompatible with existing fs modules.
