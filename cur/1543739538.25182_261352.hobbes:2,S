I am trying to get vesafb-tng to work with rc4-mm1, but are not sure
when to shift the argument by PAGE_SHIFT, and when not to.  The patches
from you in rc4-mm1 sometimes shifts the second arg, other times the
third, and other times not at all.  Is there a easy way for a mostly
clueless person to figure out when to shift what argument and when not?
Thanks,
