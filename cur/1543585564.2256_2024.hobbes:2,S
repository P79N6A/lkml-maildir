I don't have all the details worked out yet, but the utilities to extend
and defragment the filesystem will operate on a live volume, so the
utilities will need to talk to the filesystem to move blocks, extend the
block map, etc.
The utilities will probably open the root directory and apply the ioctls
to it, unless there is a better way to do it.
