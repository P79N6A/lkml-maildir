Subject: 2.1.132-4: repeatable oops on reboot, nfs/autofs related?

Hello,
I get a repeatable Oops on rebooting an 2.1.132-4/SMP
kernel. The process is either sendmail (8.9.1) or procmail.
Unfortunately the syslogd is already killed when
that happens, so I have no Oops data.
 [Is there a trick to stop the computer at that point?]
procmail is configured as the system-wide local delivery program
in sendmail.cf. sendmail is trying to deliver a mail
to a local user, that user has a home directory that is
auto-mounted and exists on a remote (Linux-)server.
The remote server is turned off, the automounter uses
the options rsize=4096,wsize=4096,hard,intr.
The system is based on Dual-PentiumII, 233MHz,
Gigabyte GA-686LX2 motherboard. The kernel is compiled with
egcs-2.90.29 980515 (egcs-1.0.3 release)
