Hi,
I think that many of us in this mailing list use strace
(
http://www.liacs.nl/~wichert/strace/
) for studying, debugging and.... 
I am writing a paper about Strace under Linux version 2.4.22-1.2197.nptl
using the strace's man page as my principal reading source. Does anybody
heres knows others sources? While I am doing some tests I see that my
results are a little bit different from the man page...Example:
In the man page's examples there are no 64 after the system call, like
in my output. What is this 64?
lstat64("/dev/null", {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(1, 3), ...})
= 0
lstat64("/home/teste", 0x92b85ac)       = -1 ENOENT (No such file or
directory)
Best regards,
