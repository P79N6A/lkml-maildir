Doing my quick review of changes to bits of code that overlap where I 
wish to work I've noticed that PF_SPREAD_SLAB and PF_MUTEX_TESTER have 
the same value.
define PF_SPREAD_SLAB	0x02000000	/* Spread some slab caches over cpuset */
#define PF_MEMPOLICY	0x10000000	/* Non-default NUMA mempolicy */
#define PF_MUTEX_TESTER	0x02000000	/* Thread belongs to the rt mutex 
tester */
This will have interesting consequences in some circumstances, I imagine.
