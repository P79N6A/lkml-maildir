Another question I have is about the different driver versions that
are around. 
Till Harbaum <harbaum@telematik.informatik.uni-karlsruhe.de> just sent
me a driver which is directly from SMC:

and "copying" is the GPL. It seems to be a not yet released extension of the driver
available from 
http://www.smc.de/sites/support/download/PCI/9432/LINUX/src9432lu.zip.
