I see no real difference between the two assertions.  Nice is just a
mechanism to set priority, so I applied your assertion to a different
range of priorities than nice covers, and returned it to show that the
code contradicts itself.  It can't be bad for a nice 1 task to run with
a nice 0 task, but OK for a minimum RT task to run with a maximum RT
task.  Iff HT without corrective measures breaks nice, then it breaks
realtime priorities as well.

Then we need to make them aware of what they're enabling?

To me it's pretty much black and white.  Either you want to split your
cpu into logical units, which means each has less to offer than the
total, or you want all your processing power in one bucket.

I don't agree that it's the exception, and if you look at this HT thing
from the split cpu perspective, I'm not sure there's even a problem.
Scrolling down, I see that this is getting too long, and we aren't
communicating anyway, so I'll cut it off here.

The above will have to do.
