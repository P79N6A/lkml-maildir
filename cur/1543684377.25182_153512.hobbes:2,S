You say that, and I certainly remember it saying just about the same thing in 
the kernel configuration help.  However there is also this from the Debian 
init file /etc/init.d/console-screen.sh
    # screensaver stuff
    setterm_args=""
    if [ "$BLANK_TIME" ]; then
        setterm_args="$setterm_args -blank $BLANK_TIME"
    fi
    if [ "$BLANK_DPMS" ]; then
        setterm_args="$setterm_args -powersave $BLANK_DPMS"
    fi
    if [ "$POWERDOWN_TIME" ]; then
        setterm_args="$setterm_args -powerdown $POWERDOWN_TIME"
    fi
    if [ "$setterm_args" ]; then
        setterm $setterm_args
I know for sure it worked with 2.4 and am fairly sure it still works with 
2.6.0-test#.
