Really? 5 instances in PPC arch-specific code, 1 (absolutely gratitious)
in drivers/mtd, 2 - in m68k (also useless), 4 - in drivers/video, 2 -
in AFFS and 1 - in netfilter.
I wouldn't call it "rather popular".

You are making the types it is applied to harder to deal with wrt. global

	But the real issue here is that preprocessor is not a way to get
polymorphism. And that would be the only context where typeof might
have any use. Trying to turn C into the things it isn't is always a bad
idea - had been proven many times. starting at least with Bourne shel
(check the v7 sh source if you don't know what I'm refering to).
