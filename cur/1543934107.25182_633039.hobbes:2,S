It seems that building a ppc based um kernel is not supported
in mainline.
Kconfig.ppc is missing and when creating it um build fails
in sys-ppc/ due to user-offset.c is missing.
As most of your patch touches ppc specific code I suggest
to just replace TOPDIR with srctree all over (no semantic change)
and the the um people can figure out the ppc stuff when they get to it.
