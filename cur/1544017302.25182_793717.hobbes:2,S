Of course. Note that much of user address space is also mapped into
kernel address space (all of it, in fact, unless you're on a 32-bit
x86 system with PAE and more than 3G or so of RAM), so such a clear
division isn't quite that easy :)
All the gory details are in mm/page_alloc.c and mm/slab.c (or slub.c
or slob.c, depending on your build configuration).
