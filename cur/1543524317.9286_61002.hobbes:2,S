Encrypted File systems implementation into the kernel?
I think its a great idea, here's the site with the source/libraries and
3DES and RC5 modules:
Currently only supports 2.0.x kernels I think , so a port to 2.2.x or
2.3.x or when 2.4.x comes out.

"In the begginning ARPA created the ARPANET.
"And the ARPANET was without form and void.
"And darkness was upon the deep.
"And the spirit of ARPA moved upon the face of the network and ARPA said,
'Let there be a protocol,'and there was a protocol. And ARPA saw that it
was good.
"And ARPA said,'Let there be more protocols,'and it was so.And ARPA saw
that it was good.
"And ARPA said,'Let there be more networks,'and it was so."
