Here's the corresponding 32-bit patch. Applies fine to (and works on) 
v2.6.23.x as well after un-uniting the paths...
I do believe it would be better to do both; x86-64 machines can run 32-bit 
kernels fine and might certainly in the form of generic (installer) kernels 
and the like so if it's a fix lets fix it across the board -- the 2 us delay 
is going to be enough for everything out there, certainly given that _0_ is 
normally enough. With the arches just merged, minimising diferences should 
be a goal in itself I guess.
One thing though -- I believe we want to adjust the loops_per_jiffy default 
to make sure this works, or would work, pre-calibration as well? Not really 
sure how needed it is, but bogomips is defined as
	bogomips = loops_per_jiffy / (500000 / HZ)
			<=>
	loops_per_jiffy = bogomips * (500000 / HZ)
which with assuming any machine above 1G isn't affected by any of this and 
bogomips coming out to 2 * MHz on anything I myself have run linux on might 
suggest that
	loops_per_jiffy = 2 * 1000 * (500000 / HZ) = 1000000000 / HZ
could possibly be a sane if very large default? Alan?
