I can't help feeling that it is wrong to add ad-hoc code to drivers (such
as: if the firmware wasn't there, try to load it again later) in an attempt
to work around what is, in the end, a userspace configuration problem.  The
fact that configuring userspace correctly seems to be tricky is sad, but not
the driver's problem.
I don't mind using request_firmware_nowait by the way.  The lack of a
timeout is no problem as long as we make it possible for the user to shoot
the firmware loading down by sending a signal.
Ciao,
Duncan.
PS: On the other hand, users are feeling the pain, which means I get to feel
their pain, which tempts me to hack in a workaround ;)
