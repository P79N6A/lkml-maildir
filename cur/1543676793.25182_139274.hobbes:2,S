ummm been there... Actually, after the first 20 it got easy... If I couldn't
read it, it got an "F" (whether it worked or not).
If it could be read with difficulty (and worked) it got a D
If it could be read and worked it got a C
If it could be read and was clear (and worked) it got a B
If it was short, clear, and worked it got an A
And I have met some of the idiots (including Piled higher and Deeper ones) 
that couldn't program their way through a "hello there" program.
