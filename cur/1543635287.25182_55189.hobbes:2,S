   Sure :)

   Ok.
   But if this is the reason for this subproblem, there are some others
and they all seem to appear simultaneously. They all are the problems with
accessing files. And as long as I got the first problem I will have a
lots of them on different filesystems until I reboot the system (AFAIK).
   Maybe the reason is some damage in global filesystem handling. (Is that
VFS?)
Bye,
Thanx a lot,
                                                         Tim
