May I ask with what?  We ran all the TAHI tests last month at ETSI
IPv6 Plugtest, and know pretty much were we stand.  And with all due
respect to TAHI, who checks that the test suites conform to the spec?

If MIPv6 is compiled as module, and is not loaded, those macros
protect against calling non-existant code.  HA and MN do not need to
be compiled statically, if that is what you are implying.  You must
first select CN support, which decides module or static.

No.  Users want to be able to have only one of the capabilities loaded
at one time (i.e. CN, CN+MN or CN+HA).  When you compile e.g. CN,
there is no HA or MN support compiled in, so the sysctl makes no sense.

No.  We did this back in Draft 15, when all the mobility stuff was
destination options.  Mobility Header is not an extension header, but
rather a final protocol.  Only Home Address Option is an extension
header and is handled in ipv6/exthdrs.c.  What is the problem with
this?

Yes, this will be done.  But that was merged yesterday, and we are
only humans :)

Right.  We haven't changed the IPv6 code to support the third
destination option header placement (after RH, before frag/AH/ESP),
and since it introduces no compatibility problems with any other
implementation we've tested with, it has not been a priority.
