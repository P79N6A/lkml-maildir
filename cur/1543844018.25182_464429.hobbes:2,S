Just in case my first mail on this subject wasn't clear enough I
completely agree with that statement.  complex traces detaches from
the actual sourcecode are an uteer maintaince nightmare and should
be avoided for anything but spontanous debugging.  For that case they
are of course imensely useful.   Thus we need two forms to specify
probes, and to not make the tracing an utter mess they need to share
as much infrastructure as possible.
