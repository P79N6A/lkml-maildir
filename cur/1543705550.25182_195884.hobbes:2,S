If the community would like to see a 2.6 patch for just the infiniband
access layer
for starters, I don't think it would be to hard to put something
together. 
I heard from a friend of mine that 2.6 was closed to new features. 
What sayith the community on allowing additional experimental drivers
(like the
infiniband access layer) into 2.6 ? Can we still submit something or do
we
have to wait till 2.7 ?
In any case, I am sure we can put together a patch and/or a tarball and
post it
to the sourceforge infiniband web site for those who want to play with
the
infiniband code on 2.6.

So, for starters, can you or Jerrie post a patch containing just the 2.6
infiniband access layer, Or create a new BK tree for 2.6 infiniband
stuff that uses the new 2.6 kbuild system?
