I've updated my bios on my Pavilion N5430 and guess what is shows on
the bios boot screen (if you disable the bios splash screen)... Omnibook
XE3.  They are one in the same, at least model number wise.  weird,
considering there are no AMD omnibooks..

My maestro is on IRQ 5, and the pIRQ table says it should be on IRQ 5, and
it works fine. Earlier 2.4 kernels (before .8 or .9) had all sorts of
problems with the maestro3 (actually Allegro-1), but i haven't had any
problems in a while.. Try ALSA, see if that fixes your problems.

Good luck.. I emailed HP support, and got the "we're forwarding your
request to the BIOS people".. and that was 4 months ago.
Ohh, and Marcelo accepted the K7/SSE patch for 2.4.17, so no need for that
patch anymore..
I will try the ACPI PCI routing stuff if i get time tonight (don't have
access to the machine right now).
