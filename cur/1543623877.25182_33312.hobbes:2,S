--------
There is no Documentation/networking/tulip.txt which is referenced in that
directory's 00-INDEX and also in the long explanation for the Tulip entry
in menuconfig.
I have upgraded to 2.4.18 and am still experiencing these kernel panics,
they seem to be exacerbated by compiling...
I have placed the most recent ksymoops dump and the current kernel config
at 
http://mit.edu/belg4mit/Public/kernel/
Thanks!
