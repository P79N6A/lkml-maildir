Just checked my own code, and SYSLINUX does indeed support 115200 (I
changed this to be a 32-bit register ages ago, apparently.)  Still
doesn't answer the question "why"... all I think you do is increase
the risk for FIFO overrun and lost characters (flow control on a boot
loader console is vestigial at the best.)
