Could this have anything to do with the following messages I've seen when 
trying -rc7 ?

That's almost the entirety of the differences between a dmesg from a 
2.6.24-rc7 boot and a 2.6.22 boot.
System itself is a Dell Inspiron 1420n laptop running a 64bit kernel and 
userland - there is a "pop" from the speakers when booting, but no sound at 
all. I'll pull a new tree from GIT, but I'm thinking that the above changes 
are probably related to the move from ACPI motherboard drivers to the PNP 
platform driver. What I don't understand is how, if there are only more mem 
resources than the new PNP platform driver can handle, why there are also 
ioport ranges that could not be reserved.
Additionally, with the same kernel, the iwlwifi driver appears to cause the 
new 802.11 code to crash. This doesn't stop the driver or cause any problems 
with the connection. I've been using the iwlwifi driver with 2.6.22 for a 
while and haven't seen anything like this.
