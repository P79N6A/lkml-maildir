Yes I was in X, but I already had the above mentioned XServer installed.  Still,
I basically have the APM problem resolved, or more correctly have determined
that both problems are likely related.
While composing the email describing my problems I smacked myself in the head
and said "What if the suspend/resume is causing the Xircom nic driver to OOPS
and I'm just not seeing it because the screen isn't quite ready yet?!".
Well, I immediately tested this idea by manually stoping the adpater before
suspending the machine.  When I resume the machine everything comes back up
correctly and it even reloads the NIC card driver.  I temporarily modified my
suspend script to do this for me automitically and now I can suspend/resume with
no problems.
So...I'm guessing the xircom_tulip_cb driver is having some problems and that if
I can get it to quit oopsing on removal that both problems may go away.
Does anyone out there using the xircom_tulip_cb driver have this working or have
similar problems?  I'd be interested to know.
Later,
Tom
