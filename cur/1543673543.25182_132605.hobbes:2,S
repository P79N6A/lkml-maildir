These are file-backed pages: they don't get swapped out.  The VM will write
them out with ->writepage(), and will reclaim them when they are clean.
A filemap_fdatawait() will do the right thing with these pages: it'll wait
on them.
There is a weird race in there wrt ongoing pagefaults in the truncated
region, but they require two processes - one faulting, the other
truncating.  fsx-linux doesn't do that.
I'd need to see some more details on the code flow, including pointers to
the relevant code in the NFS client to understand this one please.
