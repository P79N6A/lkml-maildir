Well I was. That was the point of my post which started this again. Sorry.
Seems to me that the best way to remedy this unrest is to have someone
accept maintenance of devfs and when/if it is not used to remove it
from the kernel then.
It certainly seems like a good project for a someone, such as myself, that
is new to kernel development.
However, if Andrew wants it gone from the kernel there is no point.
