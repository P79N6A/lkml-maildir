Hi All,
I have 2 questions on XMON of 2.6 kernel. Any answers are appreciated!
1) Any engineer is still developing for XMON and who is the maintainer?
2) When I issued command "ls", XMON told me there are no sysmap or 
sysmap_size. Do you know how to include the sysmap?
mon> ls
<NULL>: No sysmap or sysmap_size
Thanks,
Gavin
