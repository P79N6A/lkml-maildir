Greetings;
How much trouble will I have if I take the current 2.6.16.1 kernel src 
tree, nuke the ieee1394 directory of it, and bring the ieee1394 
directory in from the 2.6.12 tarball?
At 2.6.12, all the firewire stuff I needed to import from my camera, 
edit it, and make vcd's or dvd's out of it worked _flawlessly_.  Now, 
at 2.6.16.1, and apparently since 2.6.13-rc1, kino is broken and must 
be killed by the system when it hangs.  I figured it would get sorted, 
but apparently not.
I can recover from backups all the stuff I've overwritten in the last 2 
days trying to make it work.  That should make it all work again IF the 
ieee1394 stuff was reverted to the 2.6.12 version.  Is this feasable at 
all?
