Security modules use labels not uid's.  The uid is the basis for
traditional DAC checks, the label are used for MAC checks.  And its
easy to imagine a label that includes a notion of container id.

Yes, it's been proposed and discussed many times.  There's some
fundamental issues with composing security modules.  First and foremost
is the notion that arbritrary security models may not compose to form
meaningful (in a security sense) results.  Second, at an implementation
level, sharing labels is non-trivial and comes with overhead.

Don't follow you on this one.
