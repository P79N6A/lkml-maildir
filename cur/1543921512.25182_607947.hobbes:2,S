Actually, these three look to be related (see also link below):
01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82573E Gigabit Ethernet 
Controller (Copper) (rev 03)
01:00.3 Serial controller: Intel Corporation Active Management Technology - 
SOL (rev 03)
01:00.4 Serial bus controller [0c07]: Intel Corporation 82573E KCS (Active 
Management) (rev 03)
I did check the class files in /sys. For these devices those have:
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.0/class
0x020000
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.3/class
0x070002
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.4/class
0x0c0701
The last is close, but still does not match the 0x0c0700 in modules.pcimap. 
Is there some fuzzy matching going on there?

Hmm. Yes, guess it is -ish. It's documented in:
http://download.intel.com/design/motherbd/cz/D1406801US.pdf
 (section 1.11.4)
Looks like something that is only useful for remote management though and 
not for on-system management.
Anyway, I've blacklisted the modules for now, but still feel that should not 
be necessary and there's an incorrect match happening.
Thanks for the reply Dave.
