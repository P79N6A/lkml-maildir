In that case, the patch is as simple as you suggested earlier (patch
below). The only downside is that we hold onto ARCH_PFN_OFFSET which is a
bit of an obscure #define if you ask me. The obscurity can be lived with of
course, but it'd be nice to kick away ARCH_PFN_OFFSET if possible.

My method should very slightly reduce the size of the kernel and have a
very minor performance improvement. How measurable it is depends on how
often page_to_pfn and pfn_to_page are called.

If we decide to simply hold onto ARCH_PFN_OFFSET, the fix is simply;
