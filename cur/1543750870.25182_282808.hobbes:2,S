Sounds incorrect, unless you're generating the zeropage information.

pxelinux, isolinux and extlinux are syslinux derivatives (0x32, 0x33 and 
0x34 respectively.)  filo and redboot probably could use them, though.

Unfortunately the command line is very squeezed.  With the newer 
protocol we can probably support longer command lines, though.
It's a significant boot loader change, though.  In the short term it's 
definitely desirable to be able to read it.
