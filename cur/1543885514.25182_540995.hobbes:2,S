Doesn't build on ia64: complaints from arch/ia64/ia32/binfmt_elf.c
(which #includes ../../../fs/binfmt_elf.c) ...
arch/ia64/ia32/binfmt_elf32.c: In function `ia32_setup_arg_pages':

arch/ia64/ia32/binfmt_elf32.c:206: error: for each function it appears in.)

make[1]: *** [arch/ia64/ia32/binfmt_elf32.o] Error 1
Turning off CONFIG_IA32-SUPPORT, the kernel built, but oops'd during boot.
My serial connection to my test machine is currently broken, so I didn't
get a capture of the stack trace, sorry.
