Yes, it was done as a last resort.
We need facility that we can call from even more demanding contexts
than interrupt handlers, considering that kprobes can be placed nearly
anywhere.  This is one of the reasons why we don't just use good old
do_gettimeofday(), since it takes locks and can lead to lock recursion
if parts of itself are probed.
