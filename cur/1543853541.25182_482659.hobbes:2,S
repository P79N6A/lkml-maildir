| Bill said that he uses SLES10/ia64, so the version of libcap is different
| from Fedora Core's one. 'libcap-1.92-499.4.src.rpm' is bandled.
| 
| Then, I found a strange code in libcap-1.92-499.4.src.rpm.
| 
| The setfcaps calls cap_from_text() which is defined in libcap to parse
| the command line argument. It has the following function call chains:
| 
| cap_from_text()
|   -> cap_init()
|     -> _libcap_establish_api()
     - snip -
| capget() is called from _libcap_establish_api() with full-zeroed
| __user_cap_header_struct object at first time.
| The result of this, sys_capget() in kernel will return -EINVAL.
| (Why did strace say the first argument is 0x19980330?)
| 
| Probably, Bill didn't update libcap.so.
No, I didn't...

What version of libcap is on FC6?

But that won't work on ia64 will it?
Thanks,
Bill
