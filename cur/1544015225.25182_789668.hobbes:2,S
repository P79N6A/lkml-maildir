There is no new enough userspace yet, so I can't say what version will
have it, maybe I should mark enabled by default as experimental or
something.
If pain doesn't equate to doing something that will hurt, then I'm not
sure what will, it actually will work for some people, so I can't say
it will always be broken.
I'll see if Jesse can provide some nicer wordings...
Dave.
