yes, known issue -- to me, at least. had this on a similar VIA board
last year. happens all the time you have high DMA load. bios update
fixed it for me (or at least reduced the frequency so I did not notice
it any longer). I do not know whether it will fix it for you, maybe they
have screwed up differently this time :)

hm, because it reads ok, and the bitflip is done by the broken DMA
lateron?
