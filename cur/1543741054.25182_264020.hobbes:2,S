Hello
I found something that should be a POSIX spec but it's header says something
different. Is it a POSIX spec really?
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG15/
"POSIX ISO/IEC 9945:2002 POSIX standard in HTML "
http://www.unix.org/version3/
"ISO/IEC 9945:2003"
http://www.unix.org/version3/iso_std.html
"Register to read the html online copy of ISO 9945"
http://www.unix.org/version3/online.html
"Read The Single UNIX(R) Specification, Version 3 [...]
These volumes are also IEEE Std 1003.1 and ISO/IEC 9945."
Now it looks like there are two volumes, 1003.1 and POSIX (9945)
After registration:
http://www.unix.org/single_unix_specification/
"The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6 IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition "
I didn't find any other option on the way.
Is POSIX a part of SUS?
