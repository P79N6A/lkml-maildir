Indeed, they deserve nothing less but to get listed. Now if they
stopped firewalling ORBS, only the relaying hosts under their domain
would get listed.
Now I'm forced to block all, lest I receive any more spam.
O well, I'm already getting enough email as it is :)

I _chose_ to use the ORBS list for spam blocking. ORBS
never ever told me to do so, it was entirely my idea.
I love ORBS for the fact that their list really helps
me with blocking my spam.
Relays don't get listed in RBL until after the fact, now
I (and the subscribers to my 50 mailing lists) can enjoy
a relatively spam-free existance. This is well worth the
`price' of not being able to receive email from people
who did not chose their ISP well. I hope the bounces will
clue at least some of those people into switching to a
decent provider.
cheers,
Rik
