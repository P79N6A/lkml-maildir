Well, here's a patch that hopefully solves the mess :)
From: Cal Peake <cp@absolutedigital.net>
Undeprecate the sysctl system call and default to always include it with 
the option for embedded folks to exclude it. Also, remove it's entry from 
the feature removal file.

+	  this if you are building a kernel for a system with limited
+	  resources (e.g. an embedded device) and your kernel image will
+	  shrink by a few kilobytes.
+
+	  NOTE: Disabling this option will cause a warning to be printed
