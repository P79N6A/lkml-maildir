I was skimming through FreeBSD jail(2) documents
(
http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/papers/jail/jail.html
). 
Compared to jail
(

):

Jail thwarts these.

Also prohibited in jail.

Jail appears to allow this, and you can't get out of jail as (jailed) root
anyway.

I believe jail prohibits this as well (through its p_trespass() mechanism).

Likewise - it blocks all signals in and out from jail.

Jail takes care of this by only allowing 35 operations for jailed root (out
of the 260 allowed for normal root). Capabilies are propably better in linux
context.

I would imagine the p_trespass() check is used in FreeBSD to disallow any
memory sharing between processes that are not in the same jail.
In addition to what has been mentioned above, jail(2) notably limits jailed
processes to one ip number (that of jail's). That way the jailed processes
can't connect to hosts services (even through localhost interface) unless
they listen to jail's ip, nor bind to any ip but the one that has been
granted to the jail. They also do not allow any ipconfig, routing or kernel
parameter changes etc from within a jail.
In general, I wonder if it would make sense to aim for something like
jail(2). Chroot has its shortcomings, and I take it that many of them have
to be preserved to maintain standard compliance. Jail isolates processes
more completely than chroot is ever ment to.
FreeBSD implements jail by adding a jail pointer to struct proc - I'm not
sure how much of that should/could be done with mere capabilities in linux,
and how much of the "fortificated chroot" implementation jail has overlaps
with Al Viro's namespaces.
All in all, I've seen suprisingly little conversation about jail on
lkml. What do people think of it?
