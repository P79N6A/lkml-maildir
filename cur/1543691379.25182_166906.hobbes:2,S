Unless they clarify the GPL violating license clause I'd suggest
strongly it goes into /dev/null. The GPL states:
  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
I am perfectly permitted by the GPL to modify Linux and add other code
to it, or to create a new product based on it that is GPL licensed. 
SGI need to fix their boilerplate. I can kind of guess what they are
trying to say but it needs tweaking.
