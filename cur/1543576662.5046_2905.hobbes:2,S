Your program reads in data at 30MB/second, on a memory bus
that most likely supports something like 60 to 100MB/second.
Part of this memory bandwidth is needed for the UDMA controller
to push the data to memory, probably between 30% and 50%.
Every time the UDMA controller has the memory bus for itself the
CPU will busy-wait on memory, which shows up as CPU busy time.

Rik
