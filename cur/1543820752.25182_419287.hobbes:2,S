Have any tried yet? ;)
I won't deny it is complex (because I don't like when I make the
same point and people go on to take great trouble to convince me
how simple it is!).
But I hope it isn't _too_ bad. It is basically a dozen line
function at the core, and that gets used to implement
find_get_page, find_lock_page. Their semantics remain the same,
so that's where the line is drawn (plus minor things, like an
addition for reclaim's remove-from-pagecache protocol).
IMO the rcu radix tree is probably the most complex bit... but
that pales in comparison to things like our prio tree, or RCU
trie.

Definitely. It isn't fun if you just take the patch and merge it.
