Originally I would have thought this would be a good idea, but now that
Vista is out, which supports MSI, I don't think we are going to need
this in the future.  All new chipsets should support MSI fine and this
table will only grow in the future, while the blacklist should not need
to have many new entries added to it.
So I don't think this is a good idea, sorry.
