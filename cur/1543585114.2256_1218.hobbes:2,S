Looks like the module is getting loaded, then unloaded, then loaded
again.  Perhaps because of module autocleaning?

Put '*.debug -/var/log/debug' in /etc/syslog.conf and SIGHUP it.
With DMA and PIO debugging messages (especially timeout messages) are
normal and expected.  They are still there because DMA and PIO isn't
really widely tested yet.
If you have a Via chipset that provides a parallel port via the PCI
bus, things like IRQ and DMA get used by default.  I think this is
also a bug, and shouldn't be done unless 'irq=auto dma=auto' is
supplied to the module.

Yeah, tunelp doesn't work with 2.4 kernels right now.  It's on my list
of things to fix.  Read Documentation/parport.txt to find out about
how to adjust things like that.
Basically, if you do:
modprobe -r lp parport_pc
modprobe parport_pc irq=none
then parport won't use interrupts.

For the 'printer hangs' problem, try the latest pre-patch in the
testing directory and let me know if that fixes it.

I'm not sure what you mean here.  Can you be more specific?
