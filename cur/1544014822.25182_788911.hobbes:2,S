Ok, so looking deeper into this, how about adding
#define btree_for_each_key(head, geo, key, tmp)	\
	for (key = btree_last(head, geo), tmp = btree_lookup_less(head, geo, key);
	     key; key = tmp, tmp = btree_lookup_less(head, geo, key))
(and possibly some type-checking variants that hardcode the geo)
Does that seem correct? And would it be possible to provide btree_last()
that takes an void ** and fills it with the last entry, and the same for
lookup_less(), so we can write btree_for_each_entry() too?
