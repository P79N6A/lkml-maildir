Hi,
    I was just git updating 2.6.14-rc4 and I didn't have the 
CONFIG_IEEE80211 module selected, then I went into Device Drivers / 
Network devices / Wireless, and the IPW2100 wasn't in the list. I went, 
then Modularized the IEEE80211 and then IPW2100 was there. I think is 
kind of estrange that IPW2100 wouldn't show just because it has a 
dependencie, shouldn't IPW2100 show in the list, and if you select it, 
then it would also select CONFIG_IEEE80211?
Just a dumb question cause I dunno how is normally done or the policy to 
do this.
.Alejandro
