Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.69: mtrr: MTRR 2 not used, Bug #564
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/10/84

This one-liner fixes the mtrr not used bug, and addresses Bug #564
of Bugzilla.
mtrr_file_del was not decreasing the mtrr usage count so when
XFree86 was exiting, mtrr_close was trying to delete an already 
deleted memory type region with the freed mtrr.
