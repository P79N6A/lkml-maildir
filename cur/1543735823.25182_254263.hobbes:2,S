what do people think about a filesystem proxy kernel module?
has anyone heard of such a beast already?
(which can also do xattrs)
fusexmp.c (in file system in userspace package) does stateless
filesystem proxy redirection.
this is a PERFECT solution to the problem of users removing media
from drives without warning.  when i say perfect i mean it doesn't
cause kernel hang-ups, it doesn't involve modifications to userspace
programs such as KDE or Gnome, it doesn't involve any extra work
to HAL, nor UDEV.
it just... _works_.
but, doing file system proxying in userspace introduces an additional
and unnecessary level of inefficiency.
i was wondering therefore if anyone had attempted to do filesystem
proxying before.
ta,
l.
