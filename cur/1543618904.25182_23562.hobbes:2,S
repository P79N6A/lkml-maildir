First of all I would like to thank all the people that responded to my 
mail. Unfortunately the numbers I am using are not restricted to 
powers of two so I could not simply shift the data. I have decided to 
use the div64.h solution and it seems to work well. 
I have looked at this header file and I do not understand the asm 
syntax. 
In particular the only x86 div instruction I know only returns a 32 bit 
div result. Because I don't understand the div64 header I cannot 
see how a 64 bit result is calculated.
I also tried this header in a regular application. This failed to return 
the modulus although it works in a module.
Is this asm syntax documented anywhere ? 
Thanks Again 
Simon.
