As I said, I tried that with no success.  Btw, there is no such list in
the SI published driver (or they did it in a manner that is not immediately
obvious.)  However, this:
	Maxtor 4D060H3:DAK05GK0:MaxMode=udma-5
does show up practically without looking :-)
By way of freebsd mailling lists, it appears the dropped DMA thing is common
to the sil hardware.  However, there must be an errata/work-around as
SI's driver doesn't exhibit the same problems -- no stalls, no reported
DMA errors.
Of note is that the drive that most often stalls is of older firmware...
3.05 vs. the 3.18 of the other drives...
	Drive information:
	/dev/sga ATA      ST3160023AS      3.18 312581807 blocks
	/dev/sgb ATA      ST3160023AS      3.18 312581807 blocks
	/dev/sgc ATA      ST3160023AS      3.18 312581807 blocks
	/dev/sgd ATA      ST3160023AS      3.05 312581807 blocks
If I can/could get Seagate to give me a 3.18 firmware update for that drive,
I'll find a way to get it on there :-)
DMA'd reads don't seem to be a problem.  I'm 400G through the 10th loop
reading the entire array in 8M O_DIRECT chunks (128 16k stripes).  However,
I will note, the internal configuration of the sil chips are laughable...
reading from more than one port at a time (doesn't really matter which two)
degrades performance.  Reading from all four (hello raid) maxes out each port
to about 24MB/s.  Individually, each port (alone) can read at 48-56MB/s.
The drives are capable of streaming 85MB/s (if you believe the specs.)
