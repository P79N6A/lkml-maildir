I'm using 2.3.29 with a MultiTech MT5634ZBA-USB right now and it is
pretty reliable.
Expect the uhci-control process to panic from time to time, the acm
driver to fail to initialise occasionally because its resources are
already claimed, and a bunch of harmless error messages at
initialisation time.  Also expect your disk to fill with vast numbers of
"Set toggle" kernel messages even if you turn off uhci debugging.  But
mostly it works. :-)
