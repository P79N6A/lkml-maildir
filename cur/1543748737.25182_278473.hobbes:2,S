Subject: [PATCH] PPC64 Make sure lppaca doesn't cross page boundary
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This patch is from Will Schmidt <willschm@us.ibm.com>, with some extra
comments from me.
On iSeries and on POWER5 machines, there is a data structure which is
used for communication between the hypervisor and the kernel, called
the `lppaca'.  The kernel tells the hypervisor where it is, and the
hypervisor requires that it doesn't cross a page boundary.  With other
changes in the last few months we have ended up with a situation where
it could cross a page boundary.  This patch increases the alignment
requirement for the struct to make sure that it can't cross a page
boundary.
This is a bug fix and should go into 2.6.10.
