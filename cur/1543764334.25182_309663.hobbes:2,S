Because any use of sdev->request_queue->queue_lock would likely succeed
even after we've freed the device and released the queue.  If it's a
pointer and we null it after free and release, then any later use will
trigger an immediate NULL deref oops.
Since we've had so many nasty problems around refcounting, I just would
like to assure myself that we're doing everything correctly (I really
believe we are, but empirical evidence is also nice).
