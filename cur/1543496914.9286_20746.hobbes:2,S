Nope, sorry. But it is an SMC EtherPower II. How can I debug this if
it happens? I'm not so familiar with tcpdump :( And I have not seen
this problem for days now. I'm using 2.2.9 on my server (Dual P133)
and 2.3.3 on my client (K6-2 300). Both machines are equipped with
a SMC EtherPower II network card.
