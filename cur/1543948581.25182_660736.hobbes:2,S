Well, we can at least get rid of the warnings when min/max are nested.
I sent you a patch earlier today that uses different temp variables in
min/max/min_t/max_t to avoid this.  min/min and max/max nesting will
always see this.  I also introduced clamp()/clamp_t() in that patch
for use in libata and drivers/media.

min3()?  No _good_ ideas I'm afraid.
