Damn.  Somebody hand me a brown paper bag. :)
(Make note to self - next time, diff the right 2 versions, not the testing version ;)
I got misdirected by your comment "this will only work with RH based systems",
because (a) neither the RH9 or Rawhide tools include a depmod.old, (b)
depmod.old gets created on non-Redhat systems if you install the Rusty version,
and (c) using depmod.old *wont* work - so I totally failed to notice I'd
botched the value of $DEPMOD. ;)
