And with each distro kernel update they have to reinstall the damn thing.
If you absolutely want people to use your driver on older kernels add the
right KERNEL_VERSION (or DRI_VERSION if you want to abstract this out some
way) for older ones.
Again, how is drm different from scsi or net or whatever drivers except
that you need a big userlevel component aswell?
