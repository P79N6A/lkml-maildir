I've built both modular (which I prefer) and monolithic kernels,
and I'm wondering how much benefit at all monolithic kernels give
and if they are even remotely worth bothering with.
First off, I am aware of most of the advantages and disadvantages
of the two approaches, however I don't particularly see any
difference in the areas that are interesting to me:  Performance.
As far as memory consumption is concerned, on a modern system
with 64Mb of RAM or higher - a monolithic kernel's increased size
is lost in the noise.  A few hundred Kb of drivers built in do
not use up any significant amount of memory that is noticed -
not on my 96Mb system anyways.
What additional overhead is there when a module gets called?
Assuming that a module like af_packet is loaded allready - how
much more cruft is between the calling code and the content of
the af_packet code when it is in a module.  Is it a single
function call overhead?  Or is it more than that?  Does it get
hacked up by the module loading process to appear statically
linked anyways - giving no overhead?
Is the overhead associated with modules only module-load/unload
overhead?
Aside from these questions, are there any particular kernel
sybsystems/drivers/whatever that do significantly work better or
faster in kernel, and is measurable from userland?
Would any differences be measureable on a home PC, versus a busy
server?  In other words, would a server benefit by measureable
differences, whereas a home PC wouldn't probably make much
difference at all?
I'm just curious because a lot of stuff I compile modularly ends
up loaded 24/7 anyways, and a 'more' monolithic kernel - if
faster would be prefferred.  I just don't want to do so if there
won't be much real noticeable gain.
Please reply privately and not to the list.  Thanks in advance
for any information.
