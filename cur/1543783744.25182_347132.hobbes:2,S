Just out of curiosity, is there ANY reason why this has to be done in the 
kernel? The PPPoATM module for pppd implements (via linux-atm) a completely 
userspace ATM decoder.. if anything, now redundant ATM stack code should be 
REMOVED from Linux!
Most distributions (to my knowledge) supporting the speedtouch modem do so 
using the method prescribed on speedtouch.sf.net; an entirely userspace 
procedure. pppd does all the ATM magic.
Does this have real-world applications beyond the Speedtouch DSL modems? If 
not, I propose adding this code to linux-atm, not the kernel, since most 
users of USB speedtouch DSL modems will not be using the kernel's ATM.
