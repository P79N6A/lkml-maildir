Please note, however, that by including such changes in -mm we make _other_
things be not tested.
For example, if I can't install a new kernel and use it on my system without
replacing some other pieces of software, I just won't be using it, because I
have no time for playing with udev, hal, powersaved, acpid, ...
Then, if there are any bugs in it that would have shown up on my system,
we won't know about them unless they show up on someone else's system,
which may not happen.
The more changes that break existing setups are there in -mm, the less
people will acutally try to use -mm kernels and that will result in buggier
-rc kernels and more bugs propagating to the "stable" ones.  Do we really
want that to happen?
