   this is a bit off topic, but i was wondering whether devfs was the
   correct way to go, or whther to stay with the std /dev entries. I am
   not sure whether to take the plugne and try it.
That depends on who you talk to.  devfs is still marked as
"experimental"; and there are still some debates as to what the proper name
hierarchy should be.  Still, there are some people who swear by it (as
well as those who swear at it).
Myself, I still think the "disc" spelling is horribly wrong --- I've
heard people say that even in the U.K. and Commonwealth countries, the
term "hard disk" is much more commonly used.
