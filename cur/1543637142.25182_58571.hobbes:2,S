IMHO building everything as a module is much better in this case. Some
things are working built-in but not working as modules (eg.
probably-still-not-fixed 2.5 IDE with 2 symbols not exported properly). It
would be better to build everything as a module and then check it with
depmod so any unresolved deps could be shown
