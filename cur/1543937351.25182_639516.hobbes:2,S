I don't think there's all that much wrong with the current layout,
except the two dummy zeroes at the end.  Or, something else needs
fixing in there?

Right.

I think the scheme devised by Ram is basically right.  It shows the
relationships (slave, peer) and the ID of a master/peer mount.
What I changed, is to always show a canonical peer, because I think
that is more useful in establishing relationships between mounts.  Is
this info sensitive?  I can't see why it would be.

With multiple namespaces, of course you are only allowed to see a part
of the tree, but you could have xterms for all of them, and can put
together the big picture from the pieces.

Just feedback about the state of the thing.  It's very annoying, that
after setting up propagation, it's impossible to check the result.
