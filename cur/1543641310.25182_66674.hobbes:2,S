now i changed CMOS settings and have 
/dev/hda	ide0	DVD
/dev/hde	ide2	60 GB
/dev/hdf	ide2	80 GB (only 1 large partitition)
/dev/hdg	ide3	60 GB
but that didn't change the behaviour. After i mounted /dev/hdf the system gets 
unstable: a normal "df" receives a "segmentation fault".
Might there be a problem with large disks? My system is two years old and i 
have these problems since i had to replace 2x30 GB by 2x60 GB, because one of 
the hard discs crashed. 
I mount /dev/hdf only when a want to make a backup, so normally the disc is 
switched off (mobile rack) and then the system is quite stable, it might 
freeze but that can't be reproduced.
