Last night's run went well: that patch does indeed seem to have fixed it.
Looking at the timings (some variance but _very_ much less than the night
before), there does appear to be some other occasional slight slowdown -
but I've no reason to suspect your patch for it, nor to suppose it's
something new: it may just be an artifact of my heavy swap thrashing.
[PATCH mm] mm per-device dirty threshold fix
Fix occasional hang when a task couldn't get out of balance_dirty_pages:
mm-per-device-dirty-threshold.patch needs to reevaluate bdi_nr_writeback
across all cpus when bdi_thresh is low, even in the case when there was
no bdi_nr_reclaimable.
