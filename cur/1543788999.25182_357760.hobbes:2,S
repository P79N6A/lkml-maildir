I have a patch in my tree to convert HPET from an ACPI
driver to a PNP driver, using PNPACPI.  That should take
care of issues like this.
But my patch is waiting on some PNP work by Adam to allow
PNPACPI devices to have more than 2 IRQs.
In the meantime, I think your patch is fine.

Out of curiosity, why do you need this?  ACPI_RSTYPE_FIXED_MEM32
contains a length field, and my patch uses it.  Did you run
into some firmware that supplies incorrect information about the
size of the HPET MMIO area?
Another minor HPET nit I fixed is that it currently doesn't
use request_mem_region().  I did it in PNP terms, so it's
waiting on Adam's work, but maybe it'd be worth an interim
patch until that's ready.
