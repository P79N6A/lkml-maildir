Hi all,
	I need to fix the severe video corruption problem on my KM133
chipset by the patch described in
the post 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0204.0/0002.html
 .
I am using the stock gcc-2.96-0.76mdk of mandrake-8.2 to compile
kernel 2.4.18-6mdk. But before applying the patch in the above post
I ran a test to see if I could compile the default kernel source tree
from /usr/src/linux with the mandrake supplied default .config file. 
I ran these commands:
make dep
make clean
make bzImage
make modules
The first 3 commands worked fine. But in "make modules" I got the error:
make -C affs modules

Line 6 of linux-2.4.18-6mdk/include/linux/sched.h  is ->
extern unsigned long event;
I have even tried egcs to compile and got the same error.
If I comment out line 6 of linux-2.4.18-6mdk/include/linux/sched.h
then the compilation continues beyond this point but fails later.
The irony is that dmesg shows this ->
Linux version 2.4.18-6mdk (quintela@bi.mandrakesoft.com) (gcc version 2.96
20000731 (Mandrake Linux 8.2 2.96-0.76mdk)) #1 Fri Mar 15 02:59:08 CET 2002
which means that the same kernel was compiled by the same compiler version
which I am working with and is currently running on my machine!!
I don't get it. How was this kernel compiled in the first place if it
doesn't compile now ?
Any help is welcome.
thanks
