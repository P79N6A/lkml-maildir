Hmmm... I think I might leave it "spare" all the same just in case
something else is using it. We can always fill it in later if thats not
the case.

Its just a question of being compatible with GFS1 so far as the on disk
format goes. The gfs2_dinode structure is 100% backward compatible
(there are a couple of fields used in GFS1 no longer used in GFS2, but
they are otherwise identical) and this includes the flags. If I were
designing from scratch I'd certainly have merged the flags into one as
you suggest. Its not a big problem though - I just need to add a bit of
extra conversion code. Its better to do that than clutter the user
interface with redundant flags I think, especially when there are a
limited number,
Steve.
