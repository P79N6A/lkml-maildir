Fair enough. I don't think I would be out of line to say that our resources
are focused on enabling full ACPI functionality for Linux, including a
full-featured PM policy daemon. That said, I don't think there's anything
precluding the use of another daemon (or whatever) from using the ACPI
driver's interface.

OK one more silly aphorism and I'll shut up. ;-) "Make it as simple as
possible, but no simpler."
