I don't quite see the point about filesystem folks.
With regard to scalability, there is ongoing work in that area, and
patches on lkml that are being discussed even now, so that is hardly a
show stopper.

Users don't want to think about fine grained security at all, and
automated schemes will inevitably generate policies that are insecure ;)
SELinux already has a significant corpus of policy that has been
developed over time, most of it contributed by external contributors,
with > 190 different program domains in the current example policy.  It
has the obvious simple tool for generating policy from audit messages
produced during a run of a program, but that tool has certainly not been
a good source for secure policy.  It has tools for analyzing policies,
including information flow and goal checking, although much work still
remains to be done here.  Much better investment to work on improving
SELinux in these areas than re-inventing the wheel...
