ehh, isn't that kind of dangerous???
What if files move around on disk while dd is running? imagine that dd is in the process of copying blocks belonging to a big file "foo",
and now in the middle of this something causes "foo" (or just parts of "foo") to move to a different location - you now have a seriously screwed
copy of "foo" on the new disk...
I'd expect that all sorts of strange corruption of the copy could happen that way. I could be wrong, and maybe someone who knows more about
how the filesystems work can tell if I am, but I know for sure that I would never dare to do backups that way.
