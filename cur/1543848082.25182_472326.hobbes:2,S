Ah - ok. contig -> non-contig and OOM is usually discussed in the
context of higher order allocations failing. FWIW, I've not noticed
any extra overhead - the CPU usage seems to grow roughly linearly
with the increase in directory operations done as a result of
higher throughput for the same number of I/Os. I'll have a look at
the Vm stats, though, next time I run a comparison to see how bad
this is.
Thanks for the clarification, Steve.
Cheers,
Dave.
