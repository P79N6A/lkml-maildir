There is already - use kobject_init() to initialize the refcount to 1, and 
kobject_put() to clean it up. (kobject_add() and kobject_del() can be used 
to later add/remove it from the sysfs hierarchy). 
Or, since those objects will probably never get added to sysfs, and since 
few objects are ever promoted, we may just want to create a new, smaller 
object purely for the refcounting vehicle..
