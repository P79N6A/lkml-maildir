Any UUID generator that can produce duplicate UUIDs with probability
significantly less than purely random UUIDs is so badly broken that it
should not ever be used. Anyone who finds such a UUID generator should
immediately either fix it or throw it on the junk heap. Anyone who knowingly
uses such a UUID generator should be publically shamed.
Rather than (or at the very least, in addition to) adding a new UUID
generator, let's fix the one(s) we have.
