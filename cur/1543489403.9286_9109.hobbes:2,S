Every one in Canada will be talking about this in the morning: This
evening the CTV National News closed with a feature about Linux.
"An operating system like Microsoft Windows, only this one is free"
they describe Linux as a movement, or a lifestyle; they feature
Michael Coplan (Corel) saying their entire product line will be on
Linux by the end of the year, and by saying although it may not
be for everyone, Linux may be suitable for those frustrated with
Windows or for those who are "adventurous"
For me, this goes down in history with the day the CTV news reported
a story about Premier Bob Rae receiving "threatening email" without
pausing to explain what "email" was.
For those who don't know, CTV is Canada's largest audience national
evening news broadcast.
