There is a good reason for that.  It will be released when I believe the
chance of it screwing up your data extremely unlikely.  I actually feel
some responsibility - if BK screws up your tree, I fully expect you to 
come screaming after me with sharp pointy objects.

In RCS files, the way the file format is layed out, you'll never know
that a revision is bad unless you ask for it and discover that it is
bad.  In other words, you can have the middle of a file (like one
block or sector) go bad, and you may not find out until a long time
later.  When RCS processes the files, it does nothing to verify that
the old data is valid.  So months, years, can go by before you need that
old release to support an important customer.  And then those lovely
tapes which you made (you did make them, right?) may well be bad.
And you are suggesting that this is OK?  Fine, go to the head of the
line of people I want nowhere near my data.
And another thing: while you and your buddies may not think that this
is a problem to worry about, you aren't exactly representative.  If 
people put money and/or effort into using a source management system,
don't they have the right to know that the vendor did something to make
sure that things wouldn't break?

You'd have a point if RCS told you when there is a problem, but it doesn't.
You'd also have a point if this didn't happen in practice, but it does.
So you have no point.  He's wrong.  If you disagree, you can use a stupid
application to store your data but don't pretend that you speak for the
majority.

Yup, you can.  You have to sign a beta agreement because I haven't written
down the license yet, but other than that, yes.

Great.  I'm equally uncomfortable with you not paying for it in that case.

Feel free.  I have no interest in getting you to use something you don't
need.  In fact, when people say "why should I use BK instead of XYZ" I
respond with "Is XYZ working for you?  If so, you shouldn't".  You'd be
amazed to know that 95% of the people say "No, it isn't working".  But if
Perforce or CVS is working for you, why are you in this conversation?
If you're happy, you're happy.  If not, and BK costs you less than the 
problems cost you, that's a win.

Nope.  As I have publicly stated before: if the openlogging.org domain
BK servers go away and stay away for an extended period (3-6 months),
and the company refuses (or is unable because they are gone) to maintain
them, then the software becomes GPLed.

Hey, Nat, my man.  Go back to the start of the thread and notice I didn't 
start this, it wasn't my marketing, it was that Aegis guy who got the
ball rolling.
