I'm trying to run sparse on my external module, but sparse complains about not being able 
to find stdarg.h.  I know this bug was supposed to have been fixed back in January, but 
I'm using the latest code, so I can't explain what's wrong.  I've tried this on a couple 
different 2.6 kernels.
Here's the output I get:
make -C /lib/modules/2.6.8-24-smp/source 
SUBDIRS=/root/AMSO1100/software/host/linux/sys/devccil  C=1 V=2
