I am not sure if any of your statements before does proove that you have 
knowledge on IDE, you definitely seem to miss important knowledge about SCSI.
I hope that this will not result in missing the chance of converting
to a more useful driver concept.
There are enough other OS that use a common ATAPI/SCSI driver concept and
do not have the problems you vagely name but never really describe.
I believe it's OK to drop support for 10 year old hardware in case this
is no important hardware that _really_ needs continued support (like
e.g. 9 track trapes).
ATA devices that are neither hard disks, nor do support ATAPI decently
are Y 1992 crap - so unless you like to have continued support for your
provate museum, what is the reason that you like to prevent a change
to a more usable driver interface?
