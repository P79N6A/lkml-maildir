Hi Neil,
[ okay, just searching through my lkml folder looking for
"unable to handle" :-) ]

Yup, ecx is to blame here ...

Yes, I think David missed posting the full "Code:" here. Unfortunate.

But I went ahead and disassembled encode_fsid() anyway. I did
stumble across a "mov 0x4(%ecx), %edx" -- which turns out to be:
static __be32 *encode_fsid(__be32 *p, struct svc_fh *fhp)
{
	u64 f;
	switch(fsid_source(fhp)) {
	default:
	case FSIDSOURCE_DEV:
		p = xdr_encode_hyper(p, (u64)huge_encode_dev
				(fhp->fh_dentry->d_inode->i_sb->s_dev));
		break;
	case FSIDSOURCE_FSID:
		p = xdr_encode_hyper(p, (u64) fhp->fh_export->ex_fsid);
		break;
	case FSIDSOURCE_UUID:
		f = ((u64*)fhp->fh_export->ex_uuid)[0];
		f ^= ((u64*)fhp->fh_export->ex_uuid)[1]; /* ***** HERE ***** */
		p = xdr_encode_hyper(p, f);
		break;
	}
	return p;
}
Note that fhp->fh_export->ex_uuid is an unsigned char *, which is
4 bytes on an i386 (which is what David's system is). For some
reason fhp->fh_export->ex_uuid (%ecx) is NULL here, which leads
to the oops. I have _zero_ other knowledge of knfsd code, and
not really be of any other use, sorry.
