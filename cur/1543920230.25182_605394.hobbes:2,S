And so am I. I wouldn't change it, maybe they will contact you some later ;).
Anyway the driver faces another problem with pci refcounting (it doesn't
increment the counter) and the device might be removed from it any time the pci
bus code decides. Are you willing to test to-pci-probing patches (i.e. patches
which converts the driver to the model introduced in linux 2.4)? If not, I'll
only increment the counter on modprobe and decrement it on rmmod, since it would
be a safe (in the meaning of not changing that much code) way of fixing the problem.
thanks,
