I set this up with an Elsa VICTORY II (Banshee, AGP, 16 MB SGRAM) and
got nearly 2.5 times for 2D graphics operation and a huge bus transfer
speedup!!! It offers the same as the Pentium II does.

ironic that this would come out earlier today before i posted my question
<g>, because i only get the digest and didn't know someone had asked..
Yes, here are all the processors that now support "MTRR's", i did a little
digging, and...:
		Pentium II/Pro   :    8? MTRR registers
		AMD K6-2CTX/K6-3 :    2 MTRR registers
		Cyrix 6x86MX/M2  :    8 ARR (Address Range Registers)
		Centaur/IDT Winchip : 8 MCR (Memory Control Registers)
Richard Gooch wrote and maintains the official P2/PPro MTRR code in the
kernel...i've written him because once i write working code for the
Winchip, i'll gladly expand his interface to transparently cover all 4
chips..the problem being that i won't havea K6-2 and a cyrix to test them
out on...i've downloaded all the spec sheets for all 3 processors, so w'll
have to see...
the important thing is getting it to merge with the existing MTRR
interface, so that there's a consistant interface to access all four.
i don't see this making it into official 2.2 thouygh...maybe an unofficial
patch though, or modules...
comments? corrections?
