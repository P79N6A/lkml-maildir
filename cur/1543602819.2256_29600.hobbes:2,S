This is unfortunate.  :(
Alan:  Does this mean that we will have to use a new CONFIG_
macro instead of testing is_sony_vaio_laptop?  If so then
I will submit a new patch with "#ifdef CONFIG_SONY_PNPBIOS"s
in it and I'll let you futz with the kernel configuration
files required to set this up.

There should be no numerically named entries in /proc/bus/pnp;
you should see only the "devices" file and the "boot" directory.
You should see numerically named entries in /proc/bus/pnp/boot
for each device.
