eek!  Thanks for noticing that!

I guess we should scour the sources looking for ways read() and write()
can return EAGAIN, and make sure that there is no chance this causes
a hang in user state machines that rely on epoll.  (Sure would be nice
if the Stanford Checker was up to this kind of thing.)
