While looking over the changes between 1.5 and 1.6, I spotted this.  You
may want to fix this change:
-                   concat->mtd.eccsize != subdev[i]->eccsize) {
+                   concat->mtd.eccsize != subdev[i]->eccsize ||

+                   !concat->mtd.write_ecc != !concat->mtd.write_ecc ||
+                   !concat->mtd.read_oob != !concat->mtd.read_oob ||
+                   !concat->mtd.write_oob != !concat->mtd.write_oob) {
