You say that, but I remember the "fun" I had upgrading from FC5 to F7 when the installer couldn't
find my swap partition (as described in /etc/fstab). There were also LVM partitions to contend
with, although vgcfgbackup/vgcfgrestore seemed to sort that out nicely enough. And since I have a
PCI SATA card, the SATA drive suddenly became sdb when I switched to PATA too. So it was all very
much a "one way" process, particularly when the userspace applications needed to be re-educated as
well.
I also know of at least one person (who shall remain nameless because he ought to know better) who
is thinking about buying a brand new machine and installing F7 from scratch rather than go through
the pain of upgrading IDE to PATA.
Cheers,
Chris
