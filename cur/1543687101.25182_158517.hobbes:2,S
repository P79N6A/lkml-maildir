You mean this the other way round, no? +nice means more nice.
For the most part, most tasks start at nice 0 so they pretty much all get the 
same size timslices unless they get preempted.  The rest of the discussion 
you can debate to the end of the earth, but application counts once you've 
implemented theory. Changing it up and down by dynamic priority one way and 
then the other wasn't helpful when I've tried it previously.
