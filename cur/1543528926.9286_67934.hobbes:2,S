Okay.  I combined Adrian's and Billy's info, and it works.  Strange.  In
kernel 2.2.14 Ihad to install as a module, even though I told menuconfig
that I wanted it as a non-module.  There are not any docs that I could see
to tell me this (not in parport.txt nor lp.c), but the same thing happened
with my sound card.  It had options for module or no-module (compiled in as
regular kernel stuff), but the README for my sound card (Neomagic 256AV)
said it *HAS* to be compiled as module.  When I compiled the sound as
module, it worked great.  IS LP like this from now on?
