hi alan,
sorry to disturb you personally.but i have to resort to you.
please help me out. i am desperately in need.
I have two questions.
(1) in bsd when a socket is created, the process
creating the socket is passed as a structure
to so_create call. in linux how can we have
this mechanism by which when a socket is created
we can access the task_t of the process creating the
socket?
(2) given the sk_buff* how to lookup the associated
socket?
