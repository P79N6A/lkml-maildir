Lets say time-spent-outside-spinlock == time-spent-in-spinlock and
number-of-cpus == 2.
1 < 2 , so it should livelock according to you...
...but afaict this should work okay. Even if spinlocks are very
unfair, as long as time-outside and time-inside comes in big chunks,
it should work.
If you are unlucky, one cpu may stall for a while, but... I see no
livelock.
