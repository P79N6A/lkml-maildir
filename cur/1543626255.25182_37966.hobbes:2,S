Hmm that's a problem. BTW, is there any valid reason xfs isn't
implementing O_DIRECT via the direct_IO address space operation like the
other filesystems ext2/reiserfs/nfs? (of course I'm talking long term, I
don't pretend to change that in one day, for the short term we should
still allow xfs to use its own internal methods of doing O_DIRECT)
Fixing that should be a one liner setting a_ops->direct_IO to
ERR_PTR(-1L) within xfs. Comments?

One problem with generic_file_open is that we'd need to rely on all
lowlevel open callbacks to do the check properly if they don't support
O_DIRECT and we'd need to duplicate code, only a few fs uses
generic_file_open.  Lefting it in the vfs looked cleaner, it reduces the
check to a few liner patch.
The lowlevel callback can always drop the kiovec during its own ->open
if they don't need it, even if they uses direct_IO, like nfs.

Chuck's patch is handling fcntl as well, do you see any problem there?
(modulo the fact the kiovec is pre-allocated even if not necessary, like
in open(2)?)
