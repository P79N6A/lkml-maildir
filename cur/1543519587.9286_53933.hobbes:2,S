glibc-devel has /usr/include/linux -> /usr/src/linux/include/linux
kernel-headers has /usr/src/linux -> /usr/src/linux-VERSION
This works the same as Debian if you use the standard packages.
Upgrading kernel-headers does the right thing.
But it's also friendly to kernel hackers.
Because when kernel-headers is upgraded, it only deletes the
/usr/src/linux link _if_ the current link points to the package dir, and
only recreates the link _if_ the current /usr/src/linux is a not a dir.
(Odd logic but it works out).
So if you're hacking kernel like me and keep the current source in
/usr/src/linux, /usr/include/linux refers to your developing source no
matter what the packaging system does, say when you upgrade.  I find
this cool.
Alan, please don't change this behaviour of RH; it's cool.
