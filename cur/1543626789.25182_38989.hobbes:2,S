That was my first reaction on Dave's patch, but on the other hand it then
looked so simple to just let notify_change() do the locking (none of the
places I looked at wanted to do anything else), that it looked better
inside notify_change.
I agree with you that doing the locking outside would clean some stuff up,
since things like write already have the lock for other reasons.

Are there any standards saying either way? But yes, it sounds logical.
