One step at a time. It's quite simple to remove userland definitions from a 
header and place them somewhere else (at least technically). Since kernel 
headers are currently useless in userland anyway, nobody should care if they 
get altered any more (yeah... right :). My plan is to take care of the 
functionality covered by glibc first and start separating that stuff to some 
abi dir (that is why I've requested more details). Once a patch for 
separating header A gets merged and a new kernel gets released I'd simply 
make llh use that abi header thus making llh a kind of compatibility layer - 
apps could still include the old linux/ stuff while in fact using the new abi 
headers. Nothing would get broken this way.
Once all glibc covered stuff got separated, glibc (and all other libcs for 
that matter) would probably start using it (would they?), thus removing all 
those bloody conflicts and making glibc always up to date.
Doable plan (at least in theory). The main question is - will those patches 
get gradually merged into mainline? (Is there any possibility of getting a 
yes/no answer from Linus?)
If not, the thing gets pointless, since maintaining such patches outside the 
kernel would only need additional work, give no real benefit and accumulate 
errors with time.
