Hi
I didn't find an answer about enabling CAP_SETPCAP
Why is deemed a security risk? 
Maybe the question seems silly but, where is the risk, a root user
can setuid /bin/sh and maked things still more fun... it sounds brain dead.
Another question... why is not allowed to do the following:
uid = 0 program enables enables only one capability (in all sets) and if it
changes to another uid (by calling setuid) the program losses the
capability.
Any comment would be greatly appreciated
Thanks in advance
