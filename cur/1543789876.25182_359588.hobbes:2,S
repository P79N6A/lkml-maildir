For what it's worth I too have seen this same problem. It happens when I 
use the stock Fedora kernels but not my custom compiled kernel. I'm not 
sure what I compiled differently but at the time I thought that 
something in the new kernel fixed it.
I too am running an Athlon X2 using sata_nv. I have an ASUS motherboard. 
But what I noticed was that the problem went away if I used 2 gigs of 
ram instead of 4 gigs. When you use the whole 4 gigs there is some 
memory mapping going on and I thought perhaps the problem was related to 
the sata_nv not liking the memory mapped over the 4gig barrier. I did 
not try disabling SMP.
