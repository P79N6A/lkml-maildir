Its not the default. Its just an alternative like SLOB. It will take some 
time to test with various loads in order to see if it can really replace
SLAB in all scenarios.

There is an i386 patch pending and I have used it on i386 for a while.

Hmmm... True I have not spend any time with that platform. We can set 
ARCH_USES_SLAB_PAGE_STRUCT there to switch it off. SLUB is the default for 
mm so I am a bit surprised that this did not surface earlier.

Yes but then SLUB has more diagnostics etc etc than SLAB to prevent any 
issues. In debug mode all slabs are separate. The merge feature is very 
stable these days and significantly reduces cache overhead problems 
that plague SLAB and require it to have a complex object expiration 
technique. As a result I was able to rip out all timers. SLUB has no cache 
reaper nor any timer. Its silent if not in use.

SLAB has a certain paradigm of doing things (queues) and I had to work 
within that framework. It was a group effort. SLUB is an answer to those 
complaints and a result of the lessons learned through years of some 
painful slab debugging. SLUB makes debugging extremely easy (and also the 
design is very simple and comprehensible). No rebuilding of the kernel. 
Just pop in a debug option on the command line which can even be targeted 
to a slab cache if we know that things break there.
