This is only true for the CONFIG_NUMA case.

The two cases were your patch still applied memory policies were:
1. nodeid = -1. This is one particular case that we wanted to fix because
   it means use numa_node_id().
2. The case where the nodelist does not yet exist.
AFAIK this situation only occurs on boot strap when we are actually 
attempting to allocate from a different node than what we are running on. 
Falling back to the local node is the right thing to do because we have 
that already working. A process that is running on a node must always have 
the nodelists for all caches allocated. The cpuup callbacks take care of that.
kmalloc_node needs work like page_alloc_node. page_alloc_node() never 
consults memory policies and thus one would not expect kmalloc_node to do 
so either.
