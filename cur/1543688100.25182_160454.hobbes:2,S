I've just updated to 2.4.22-rc3 (since bkcvs doesn't seem to have
final 2.4.22 yet). There, the BUG is not triggered. Instead I get
tons of these:
Unexpected dirty buffer encountered at do_get_write_access:616 (03:07 blocknr 2472965)

These messages pile up as long as I run fsx.
Again, this is on an ext3 partition mounted with data=journal.
