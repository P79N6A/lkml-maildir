Subject: Kernel 2.4.x TODO
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

All,
Was the TODO list at 
http://linux24.sourceforge.net
 just meant to be useful
before 2.4.0 was released?
It seems to me that it would still be useful for (amongst other things)
potential kernel hackers looking for something to have a stab at but it
doesn't seem to up to date. Is it still supposed to be being maintained by
anyone?
Martin.
