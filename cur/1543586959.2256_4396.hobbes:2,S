Thats clear to me. But the probe and remove routine can only be called
if the module is already loaded. My question was: who will load the
module? (I'll call it 'netmos.o')
devfs in its standard configuration knows about loading serial.o or
parport.o when /dev/tts/* or /dev/parport/* is accessed. Some other
module loads are triggered by module dependancies (e.g. lp.o requires
parport.o)
If I do a 'modprobe serial', how should the serial driver know that the
netmos.o should be loaded, too?
There is a file called 'modules.pcimap', which contains modules for
specific PCI devices. That's how hotplugging could detect that there's a
netmos card and that netmos.o should be loaded. That looks clean to me,
but I'm not shure if this sort of PCI hotplugging is already
implemented.
bye, Michael
