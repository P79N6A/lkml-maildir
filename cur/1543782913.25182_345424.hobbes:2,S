This "fix" also seems to break all powermac laptops around :( In fact,
it might break any user of pci_map_rom() as it exposes a bug in that
function.
The problem is that their firmware doesn't assign a ROM resource as they
have no ROM on the video chip (like most laptops). radeonfb and aty128fb
among others will call pci_map_rom() to try to find an x86 BIOS ROM with
some config tables in it.
pci_map_rom "sees" that the resource is unassigned by testing the parent
pointer, and calls pci_assign_resource() which, with this new patch,
will do nothing.
Unfortunately, pci_map_rom will not notice this failure, and will
happily ioremap & access the bogus resource, thus causing the crash.
I'll come up with a fix for pci_map_rom later today.
While looking there, I also noticed pci_map_rom_copy() stuff and I'm
surprised it was ever accepted in the tree. While I can understand that
we might need to keep a cached copy of the ROM content (due to cards
like matrox who can't enable both the ROM and the BARs among other
issues), the whole idea of whacking a kernel virtual pointer in the
struct resource->start of the ROM bar is just too disgusting for words
and will probably cause "intersting" side effects in /proc, sysfs and
others... Shouldn't we just have a pointer in pci_dev for the optional
"ROM cache" instead ?
