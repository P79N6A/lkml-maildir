Subject: Failed build on Alpha with binutils 2.13

When compiling the kernel on an Alpha with binutils 2.13, everything
works fine, until the final 'depmod' in the end of 'make modules'.  It
fails with lots of unresolved symbols.  Relinking the kernel with
binutils 2.12 solves it.  What's going on?  Is it being fixed?
