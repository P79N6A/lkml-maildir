Sorry for late reply, but I somewhat missed your original posting.

Which applications are you running and what Matrox hardware is it?

Symptom you described (character painted into half - and damaged) happens
only when someone else tries to write data to accelerator while ILOAD
accelerated operation is processed. Are you running some tty output 
intensive application on one of VT in question? Is accelerated X server
one of VT? Maybe there is some lock missing somewhere... If kernel is 
older than 2.3.46-pre2, you can try to enable MATROXFB_DEBUG_REENTER 
in matroxfb and look whether you'll get some error message about reentrancy 
in the log (is printk() on your system printing to console? Often?)
  There are two workarounds - either you can disable matroxfb acceleration
at all, as already pointed by J. Simmons, or you can boot with
video=matrox:fastfont:40960 - it will disable ILOAD operations at cost of
40KB of available video RAM.
  If you'll be able to trace down reason, why driver is reentered, I'm
interested in your data - there should be only one reason for reentering -
- printk(). 
  If you do not run real-time tasks on your system, you can also
replace CRIT_BEGIN with 
spin_lock_irqsave(some_global_spinlock, some_local_variable); and
CRIT_END with
spin_unlock_irqrestore(some_global_spinlock, some_local_variable);
  It is 100% safe and probably preferred solution - but it can disable
interrupts for way too long. But it should not be an issue on SMP system
(but I never benchmarked it). 
  If you are using 2.3.46-pre2 or newer kernel, you'll have either restore
CRIT_BEGIN/CRIT_END in driver (all these strategicaly placed macros were
removed by someone when removing CONSOLE_BH... :-( ), or download G400 
dualhead patch from 
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-lastest/maven-000216-for-2.3.46-pre3.gz.
But 2.3.46-pre2 and newers contains some changes in this area, so maybe
that problem does not exist anymore.
                                    Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec
