Actually... there is a way to do this sort of incrementally, I think:
 (1) Turn this sort of thing:
	do_work(struct x *x)
	{
		...
	}
	queue_x(struct x *x)
	{
		INIT_WORK(&x->work, do_work, x);
		schedule_work(&x->work)
	}
    Into this sort of thing:
	#define DECLARE_IMMEDIATE_WORK(w, f) DECLARE_WORK((w), (f), (w))
	#define DECLARE_DELAYED_WORK(w, f) DECLARE_WORK((w), (f), (w))
	#define INIT_IMMEDIATE_WORK(w, f) INIT_WORK((w), (f), (w))
	#define INIT_DELAYED_WORK(w, f) INIT_WORK((w), (f), (w))
	do_work(struct work_struct *work)
	{
		struct x *x = container_of(work, struct x, work);
		...
	}
	queue_x(struct x *x)
	{
		INIT_IMMEDIATE_WORK(&x->work, do_work); //or
		INIT_DELAYED_WORK(&x->work, do_work);
		schedule_work(&x->work)
	}
 (2) Make delayed_work equivalent to work_struct:
	#define delayed_work work_struct
 (3) Then apply the rest of the patches such that they remove the #defines as
     appropriate.
Might that help?
