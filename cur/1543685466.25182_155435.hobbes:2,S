The out-of-order problem is due to "nbd-client -d" (the disconnect 
thread) winning a race with "nbd-client" and setting sock = NULL after 
nbd_do_it returned and before NBD_DO_IT gets into its down'd region and 
calls shutdown. This was the hazardous race that I was having a hard 
time remembering and explaining before that also needed locking for.
