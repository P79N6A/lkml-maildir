Yes, but why does it lock up the whole machine? I'd say just that one
process should go into 'R', but other things should get scheduled right?
Or is some very common lock being held? The machine responds to pings,
so interrupts are working.
In fact as this is a hyperthreaded machine, why don't I see anything
running on the "other virtual cpu" ? I only see nfsd spinning on CPU#0
Could it be a CPU problem, the other CPU-thread is in i_size_write() but
that CPU-thread is simply never run ? To test this, I rebooted the exact
same 2.6.2-rc2 kernel with "maxcpus=1" .. and it doesn't lock up ..
(Still weird that -mm doesn't lock up)
Mike.
