This reminds me the unfortunate (and much needed) lack of an unified way
to send/receive out-of-band data to/from a regular fd.
Something like:
	oob = fd_open(fd, channel, flags);
	write(oob, ...)
	read(oob, ....)
	close(oob);
Don't you think it's time to introduce it and to start to avoid the
proliferation of different tricky ways to do the same things?
