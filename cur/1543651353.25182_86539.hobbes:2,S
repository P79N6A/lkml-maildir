Note that "should work" does not necessarily mean "does work". For
example, in the IDE world, some of the generic packet command stuff is
only understood by ide-cd.c, and the generic IDE layer doesn't necessarily
understand it even if you have a disk that speaks ATAPI. I think Jens will 
fix that wart.
