In kernel version 2.3.35 the routine ext2_read_inode in fs/ext2/inode.c
reads in the "i_data" from the disk copy of the inode even for character
special devices.  Version 2.2.13 did not do this.
For character special devices it then calls the routine
init_special_inode in fs/devices.c.  This routine does not store
anything into the inode field u.generic_ip.  As a consequence, this
field is non-zero when the character mode driver's open routine gets
called.  Not good.
The attached patch fixes the problem.
