2GB, but It doesn't need to dump that much for good performance.
Hibernate here consists of:
   echo "$(( 256 * 1024 * 1024 ))" > /sys/power/image_size
   echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
Plus a couple of fiddly commands to deal with the ATI binary X server.
We use this on other machines here too, with 2GB RAM (most of them)
and 1.3GB RAM (very slow HD, so it takes longer on that one).
Cheers
