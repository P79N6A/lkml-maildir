OK, what I'm talking about here is the way that it is done now with
existing code.  It seems to work and make people happy, but it certainly
isn't the only possible way to do it.  I'm very open to suggestions. :)
There really are two distinct pid spaces.  Instead of vservers, we tend
to call the different partitioned areas containers.
Each container can only see processes in its own container.  The
exception is the "global container", which has a view of all of the
system processes.  Having the global container allows you to do things
like see all of the processes on the whole system with top.
So, the current tsk->pid is still unique.  However, there is also a
tsk->virtual_pid (or some name) that is unique _inside_ of a container.
These two pids are completely unrelated.  Having this virtualized pid
allows you to have the real tsk->pid change without userspace ever
knowing.
For example, that tsk->pid might change if you checkpointed a process,
it crashed, and you restarted it later from the checkpoint.

99% of the time, the kernel can deal with the same old tsk->pid that
it's always dealt with.  Generally, the only times the kernel has to
worry about the virtualized one is where (as Eric noted) it cross the
user<->kernel boundary.
