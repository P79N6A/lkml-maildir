If you compiled your kernel with "USB verbose debug messages"
(CONFIG_USB_DEBUG) enabled, USB subsystem should log a message every
time a device is connected and disconnected. These messages will be
there in /var/log/messages if this file survives hard reset. These
messages can show you if USB detected a reconnect from your keyboard and
mouse the last time you switched from mac to PC.
