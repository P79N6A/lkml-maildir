Yikes!  If your "midnight commander" is like most, every copy or rename
operation creates a child which execs `mv` and/or `cp`. They will get
a heart-attack when half, but not all, the library is copied.
Easy way. I did it last night. I made a root-fs which had the limited
tools that I required. It took 29 Mb (I could have make it smaller,
but I didn't waste time gettng rid of a lot of stuff. I just got rid
of /usr/doc, /usr/X11... /lib/X11, etc. I had already built the
new glibc.
Then I booted, using the new root file-system. Then I mounted the old
off from /mnt and installed glibc by modifing configparms. This
puts the stuff where it will be on the old root.
Then I made a static copy of ldconfig.static, /sbin/mount.static,
/sbin/umount.static, and /bin/bash.static.
I booted the original root at: init=/bin/bash.static, mounted the
root fs r/w using mount.static, executed ldconfig.static, unmounted
the fs using umount.static, and then hit the boot-switch.
Done. I now have the 'original' glibc-2.0.6, compiled with a later/better
'C' compiler, gcc-2.8.1. The original was compiled with gcc-2.7.2.
As I mentioned, there would not have been any of these problems if I
was compiling and installing a later version of the C-library because
none of the executables would have know about it, having been linked
against the existing which would not have been touched. 
What I should have done in the beginning is just bumped the minor
version number of glibc and everybody would have been happy. However,
If I had a problem with the library gnu.gurus might not appreciate
that.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
