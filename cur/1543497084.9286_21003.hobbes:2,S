   i am currently starting to write a serial multiboard driver
   for the Aurora Aries 8000P/16000P cards.
   I am wondering if the callout devices are still in use because
   i remember that they are obsolete since the 2.0 times. If i am 
   correct do i have to implement them ?
The kernel has started warning people that the cua devices are obsolete
as of the 2.2 kernel.  Unfortunately not all of the distributions (and
have been appropriately chastised on another list for not knowing that
Debian *has* phased out use of the cua devices) have made the cua
devices go away in their latest 2.2-kernel based distributions.  This is
unfortunate, since a large number of users may still expect that they be
there.  So whether you feel the need to support it is up to you, and
depends on who your user/customer base is.
