Greetings,
I am Mr Jackson Terry the manager of Auditing and 
Accounting department of A BANK  here in Africa. In my department, we 
discovered an abandoned sum of US$ 36,000,000.00 Million dollar(THIRTY 
SIX MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account that belongs to one of our 
foreign customers (Mr Andreas Schranner,a property magnate in German ) 
who died along with his entire family and son inlaw and family in July 
2000 in a plane crash. For more information about the crash visit this 
site(
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm
) 
I am only 
contacting you as a foreigner because the bank is going to welcome you 
as a foreigner and for the fact you have the correct information about 
the account, which I will give to you before we proceed. 
I strongly 
believe in God that you will never let me down in this business 
because you are the only person i have contacted in this business. I 
need you;re full co-operation to make this work fine.If you are 
Capable to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according 
to My instructions and advice we will achieve this money immediately, 
because this opportunity might not Come again in life. 
Once we 
conclude this transfer, you will get 40% of the total amount as your 
own share. As soon as I receive your response, we will proceed with 
the transfer. 
Yours Faithfully, 
Mr Jackson Terry
