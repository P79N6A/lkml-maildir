Hi,
does anyone know anything more than "Intel have a driver internally, depending 
who you ask, and might release it at at unspecified time, if they feel like 
it" about the Centrino wireless adapter (Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 LAN MiniPCI 
Adapter).
I've heard several interesting rumours along those lines, but nothing more. 
Just wondering if anyone knows about or is working on support for this 
device.
thanks in advance,
Andrew
