Subject: [PATCH 0/3] allow drivers to flush in-flight DMA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Altix supports "posted DMA", so that DMA may complete out 
of order. In some cases it's necessary for a driver to 
ensure that in-flight DMA has been flushed to memory for 
correct operation.
In particular this can be a problem with Infiniband, where 
writes to Completion Queues can race with DMA of data.
The following patchset addresses this problem by allowing a 
memory region to be mapped with a "barrier" attribute. (On 
Altix, writes to memory regions with the barrier attribute 
have the side effect that in-flight DMA gets flushed to host 
memory.)
There are three patches in this set:
[1/3] dma: introduce no-op stub "dma_flags_set_dmaflush"
[2/3] dma: override "dma_flags_set_dmaflush" for sn-ia64
[3/3] dma: use dma_flags_set_dmaflush in ib_umem_get 
      (mthca only, for now)
