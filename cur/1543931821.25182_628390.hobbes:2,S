Until now 2 things were necessary to reproduce the problem -
1) CPU_IDLE=y and
2) Wakeups from Idle = 5-7 Per second (== Longer/deeper C state residency)
If I left the wakeups to high number (50-60) - there were no lockups
but it was very jerky over ssh.
(Typing keys had no effect for seconds etc.)
CPU_IDLE=y
With max_cstate=1 and CPU_IDLE=y things are pretty smooth - no lockups
for the last hour. (Soft lockups used to appear in minutes
previously.)
With max_cstate=2 - old story repeats - it's very jerky and soft
lockups appear in under a minute after going to 3-5 wakeups from idle
per sec.

Normally (without any max_cstate= parameter) I see this -
(I admit I never thought there was a C8 - C3 was all I ever heard.)
[parag@mini router]$ cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power

max_cstate:              C8
