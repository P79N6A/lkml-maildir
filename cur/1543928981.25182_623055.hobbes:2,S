There were 3 instances where macros were
used to specify an array size.  It seems
cleaner to use SEs and direct use of calculations
for those 3 instances. (ymmv)
What would you expect this to do?
        struct {
        	unsigned char ha[ALIGN(32,sizeof(unsigned long))];
        } foo;
        
A casual reading might suggest 0.

That appears to be the generally accepted coding style
for macros and statement expressions.
Whatever is agreed to is fine by me.

Yes. It's definitely a cleanup.
I think creating a separate include for the printk related
defines and functions will be useful for possible future
improvements to logging.
There are many private logging definitions that could be
consolidated in generic way.  Things like:
	#define MY_PRINTK(fmt, arg) print(PFX fmt, ##arg)
