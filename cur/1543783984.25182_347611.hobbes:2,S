Better engineering is to take the minimum size and then
add some safety margin.  Running with the minimum only
is ok when you have the infrastructure to prove maximum
stack usage, but Linux is far too complex for that. In general
running with no safety margin is not a good idea.
BTW your minimum doesn't seem to be everybody's
minimum - everytime you see someone advocating
the smallest stacks they go "it's fine for us, but don't
use A, B, C, D" (and I expect these lists to get longer
with more experience). 
The trend in Linux clearly seems to be towards more
complex code. While that is not always a good thing but
it seems to be unstoppable (everybody wants their
favourite features and the merging machinery is well oiled
and in full action). And doing all that will need more 
stack space over time so shrinking is clearly the wrong
strategic direction. 
At some point we undoubtedly will need to increase it further, 
the logical point would be when Linux switches to larger softpage 
sizes.
