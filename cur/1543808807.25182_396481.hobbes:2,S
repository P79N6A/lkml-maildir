I checked with gcc-3.3 and before the patch:
$ size kernel/built-in.o
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 197342   48061   44896  290299   46dfb kernel/built-in.o
After the patch:
$ size kernel/built-in.o
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 197346   48061   44896  290303   46dff kernel/built-in.o
Impressive savings...
bye, Roman
