Why do you need a whole major for this driver?  You have more than one
device in the system at a time?

Don't document functions that do nothing, that's just busy work...

This is a symptom of a broken driver.
Hm, I wonder if there's some way for the compiler to check the fact that
a function pointer passed to another function, is really a null
function.  That would stop this kind of nonsense...
I'm sure I commented on this driver already, yet, I never got a response
and the code is not changed.  Is there some reason for this?  That's a
sure way to prevent your patch from ever being applied...
