Most UDP services use the server socket to access remote servers. For
example, bind will only use its source port 53 to emit requests, ntpd
will only use source port 123, this *is* how they have been working for
ages. PIX is totally buggy and does not respect standards, it respects
what seems to be "common practices" (remember TCP ECN ?). If the
developpers have observed that freebsd wastes lots of source ports for
DNS requests, they will decide that using the same one is probably an
attack. I even remember that it does not support NTP correctly. When
an NTP server on your LAN "connects" to another one outside, it
translates the source port 123 to another source port < 1024, which
most servers and/or firewalls drop (they only let 123 or >=1024 in).

Perhaps the other OS you have seen simply close the socket as soon as they
get their response, and have to create a new one for each new request...
How does any DNS server forward to outside through your PIX ?

I doubt you can reliably use any UDP-based application through this
firewall then... It seems more buggy than other pixes I have encountered,
and I think you can configure it to be less silly, but I don't know how.
You agree that a session is defined by these 5 numbers :
  - proto (udp, tcp, icmp, ...)
  - source ip, source port
  - destination ip, destination port
If these 5 parameters are the same within a certain time frame, the packet
belongs to a known session. If the combination is different, then it is a
new session, and there is no reason for the firewall to drop a new session
only based on the fact that 3 parameters out of 5 are the same as other ones.
It is as stupid as saying that you refuse to establish a new TCP connection
on some dest:80 because you just did it 30ms ago.
I you want to work around this buggy behaviour without reconfiguring the PIX,
you can also play with iptables on the linux machine to use a random source
port range :
  iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j SNAT --to-source <your ip>:1024-65534
But this is a dirty hack...

Willy
