Where does it say anything about that their resolution is equal?

I know it and above is an _interface_ description, but what leads you to 
the conclusion that your _implementation_ is the only correct one?
Thomas, are you even interested in discussing this? Do you just expect 
that everyone accepts your patch and is happy? So far it's difficult 
enough to get you to explain your design, but a serious discussion also 
requires to look at the possible alternatives. It's quite possible I'm 
wrong, but you have to try a little harder at explaining why.
bye, Roman
