I found it once in the dmesg log (attached here); I
have nerver found it when running previous kernel
(2.4.18; 2.4.19-pre6 and less than pre6). The
performance is really good. It seems to use the cache
much more effectively. I will check if the problem
persist. Is there any danger to my hard drive if I
keep using this kernel?
