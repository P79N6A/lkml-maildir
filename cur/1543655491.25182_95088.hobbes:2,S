I think your original post saying you expect non-predictability is/was
very misleading. I think you meant the application can't make assumptions
based on knowing which thread will be scheduled next, but even then the
truth is that if it is always deterministic then assumptions could be
legitimately be made. 
If it was random then a thread could wait forever, and Murphy's law says
it would happen most of the time:-(
