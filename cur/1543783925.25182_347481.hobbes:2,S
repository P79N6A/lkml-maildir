It does make sense and is different from
static inline __attribute__((always_inline)).
Try:
static inline __attribute__((always_inline)) void foo (void) {}
void (*fn)(void) = foo;
vs.
extern inline __attribute__((always_inline)) void foo (void) {}
void (*fn)(void) = foo;
In the former case, GCC will emit the out of line static copy of foo
if you take its address, in the latter case either you provide foo
function by other means, or you get linker error.
