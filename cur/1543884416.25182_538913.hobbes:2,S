As long as there is only one, not really.  It would be good if we could
get rid of it though.
The practical problem is the race with rmmod, in particular if someone
calls rmmod while this thread is still running.
If I get clever I think this is likely solvable with something like.
kthread_maybe_stop(struct task_struct **loc)
{
        struct task_struct *tsk;
        tsk = xchg(loc, NULL);
        if (tsk)
        	kthread_stop(tsk);
}
kthread_stop_self(struct task_struct **loc, int exit_code)
{
        struct task_struct *tsk;
        
        tsk = xchg(loc, NULL);
        if (tsk)
        	put_task_struct(tsk);
	do_exit(tsk);                
}
I'm not quite convinced that is a common enough paradigm to implement
that.

Good question.
The whole concept of something that feels like a core part of the
platform code being modular I'm still looking at strange.

Yes.  I was thinking calling it kthread_orphan or something like that.
We can't make anything like that the default, because of the modular
remove problem, but it's not to hard.
