I am also using GeForce 2 currently I am using the nvidia drivers
that comes with X window. NOTE: they do _not_ support DRI. The only
drivers that support DRI are those that I supplied by NVidia (as far as
I know)
The freeze when switching from graphic mode to console has been around
for a while now look at:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0111.2/0237.html
and yes not everyone who complained had the nvidia drivers loaded.
Yes the could be other things that causes the hangs, but _I_ only
experience those hangs when _I_ use the nvidia drivers.I'm not on a
witch hunt, but when I can't reproduce the problem without the nvidia
drivers. I think it is logical to start suspecting that the problem is
caused by those drivers.
