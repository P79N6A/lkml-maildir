No. That just means the CPU supports hyper-threading technology. That
doesn't mean it actually has an extra CPU per physical core, or that even if
it did, that that core was enabled.

Intel considers multiple physical cores on a chip to be hyper-threading too.
HT is a marketing term, not a technical one.

Yeah, that's wrong for many reasons. Even if the CPU does support an extra
logical core per physical core, it may or may not be enabled and in use.
Basically, the HT bit being set tells you that you should continue to
determine the number of logical and physical cores present. It's just a step
in the detection sequence.
