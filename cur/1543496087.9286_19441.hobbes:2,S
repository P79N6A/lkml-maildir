There's a Linux-2.3.3 out there on ftp.kernel.org, this one hopefully
fixes pretty much all the waitqueue changes (and I'll disable waitqueue
debugging in 2.3.4 unless something comes up).
And yes, before anybody tells me, I know I forgot to increment the version
number. So "uname" is goign to report 2.3.2 unless you fix that by hand.
I'm also leaving for a very quick trip to Finland in another two hours, so
don't bother emailing me - please discuss isues on the kernel list, and
I'll catch up when I get back on Friday (yes, I'll spen as much time in
airplanes as I do on the ground - fun, fun).
Have fun,
		Linus
