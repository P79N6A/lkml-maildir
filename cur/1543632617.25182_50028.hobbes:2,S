Hi all.
Some changes in this release...
Andrea has merged the O1 scheduler, even with some updates, so half
the reason for may tree (updated VM and O1-sched) is gone (what is
good). So instead of cloning half of Andrea's tree, now -jam applies
on -aa. In fact, you even do not need to get -aa separately, it is
included as patch 00-aa-xxx.
You will notice that the ide-convert.10 patch has been dropped. The
highmem support in -aa IDE code made me to heasitate... And there are
new e100/e1000 drivers from 2.5.20.
Get it at:
