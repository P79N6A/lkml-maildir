Well, you'll have to sign the flash plugin. This isn't
sign-at-compilation-time; bsign can sign just about anything (although I
guess the Mozilla security shared library, which is itself signed by a
different tool, might pose an interesting conundrum).

Well, yes, but if the app isn't signed the attacker can't run it.
Obviously digsig doesn't close all avenues of attack: you'd use
exec-shield or something of the kind to block off the executable-stack
thing from the majority of apps (and yes, if you flip PT_GNU_STACK you
should resign the app, IIRC).

Everyone seems to want the One Security Fix To Rule Them All. This
isn't it: it's just one of a myriad of barriers to throw in the
bad guys' way. None of them stop everyone: most of them should
stop most of them.
I'm not trying to keep governments out. If they want in, they'll
*get* in, if need be by breaking in and physically removing the
machine...

The idea is that you don't *have* them on there when you do the
initial signing round, and that after that you only sign the
stuff you install yourself (and, of course, that you don't keep
the key on the same machine, or even accessible without physical
actions, I'd hope: that's why I keep mine on a CD-ROM physically
removed from the drive when not signing).
