Albert, please do not misrepresent my point. The current code is perfectly
OK if holes remain what they are now. _Full stop_. 
i only complained about the ability to extend it in the future (near
future) - but the code is not at all unreadable right now. Actually,
buffer_hole() _right now_ does increase complexity slightly, and i know
that pretty well because i have coded it. You have misunderstood my point,
lets just stop this argument here.
