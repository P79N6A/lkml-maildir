if I modify the code like this
char abc;
                 if(read(fd,&abc,1) < 0)
                         perror("read to bar failed: ");
                 close(fd);
Which will be sucess... This intern states that my file descriptor is right
.... but write returns EBADF... both are contradicting statements....
