ntpd work only on system with a drift of maximum +/-500ppm. This post 
summarize a lot of informations about the problem:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113105244509795&w=2
It was found later that an issue into the nForce2 is the root of the 
problem and that a BIOS update solve it.
6.0 / (60*24*7) * 1e6 = 595.24
6 minutes per week is near 600ppm, it's enough to trigg the problem you 
have seen. Even very cheap crystal are 100ppm at commercial temperature 
range. 100ppm is about 1 minute per week. Some crystal manufacturers 
propose now 30ppm as the default standard at commercial temperature range.
As your watch prove, good cristal can be just a few ppm (about 3.86ppm 
for your watch)
