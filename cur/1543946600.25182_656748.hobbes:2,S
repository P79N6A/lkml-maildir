Could you please explain what magic math does the 2030 -> 2038
extension ?
According to the code the 1970 comparison works until 2069:
	year += 1900;
	if (year < 1970)
		year += 100;
I keep the patch nevertheless as it removes ifdeffery, but I change
the commit log to something sensible and remove the year < 1970 check
as well as it is not longer necessary.
Thanks,
