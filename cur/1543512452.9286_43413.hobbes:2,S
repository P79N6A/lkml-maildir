In fact I didn't even get as far as changing kdev_t itself.
I have just introduced and used it to melt the few arrays,
which are indexed through MINRO(dev) into a single array of structs.
Thus I have approached the problem from the bottom, instead of top
down... But this is something anybody serious about it will do anyway
:-).
This action was already sufficient for the impact on performance I saw.
(I tested it basically by using hdparm -[tT] /dev/hdxx).
I hope it's clear now?
