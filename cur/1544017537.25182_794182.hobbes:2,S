Kernel 2.6.28 and such a situation:
- process A obtains read lease on file via fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, F_RDLCK).
- while process A holds lease, process B tries to open this file for writing,
  what, of course, leads to block process B on open().
- while process A holds lease and process B waits on open(), process C
  tries to open the same file for reading.
Then, process C also blocks on open(), even though it calls open() only
for reading. Even if process B terminates before process A removes lease,
process C still can't open file for reading. But if process B doesn't try
to open file for writing, process C can open it for reading without any
trobule.
Why there is such a bahaviour? Is it not a bug?
Regards.
