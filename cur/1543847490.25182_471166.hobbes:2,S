Hmmm.  The machine claims to be running SuSE.  We have it recorded as
SLES9, but I actually can't find any way to tell from the machine which
actual release thereof it is.
This version of ud
gekko-lp1:~ # udevinfo -V
udevinfo, version 021_bk
gekko-lp1:~ # rpm -qa | grep udev
udev-021-36.32
This seems to be the correct version for the first GA of SLES9.
