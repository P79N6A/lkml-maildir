As discussed before, the above chunks do drop one #ifdef CONFIG_SMP
but it does add a obscure relocation and please note that it's
different from early_gdt_descr.  early_gdt_descr is needed to bring up
the cpu so there's no other way to do it but to relocate it in
assembly.  If you absolutely have to relocate irq_stack_ptr early,
please do it in C code in head64.c but then again irq_stack_ptr is not
even necessary till traps_init() which is way after per cpu area
setup.  So, the above two chunks are not necessary && even if they go
in, they don't have much to do with this patch.
In general, I think trying to early initialize per cpu pointer to per
cpu variable just isn't a good idea and should be avoided as much as
possible.  I think the #ifdef there is fine - it's short and apparent
and represntative of the two separate percpu implementations we have.
If you're annoyed by it, I think it would be better to either
consolidate such #ifdefs (there are a few other places) or define a
wrapper macro to conditionalize and document the different
initialization paths, but please don't add obscure assembly
relocation, especially not without comment explaining it.
Thanks.
