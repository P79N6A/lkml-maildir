It may not block - it's executed by the kernel in order to empty the
queue of requests for the device, and the kernel executes it with the
io lock held. So that's that. It can return without emptying the
queue, but that's another story. It must return immediately.

No they don't. NBD moves the requests to an internal queue when the
request function is run. The function does not block. The internal
queue is later emptied by another means, in another context.

Well, since the hypothesis on which the question is based is mistaken,
it's hard to say!
