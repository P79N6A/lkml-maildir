Perhaps.  By the way is there a way to disable update time modification
as well ?  It would make quite a good sense for partition used for
Database needs - you do not need last modification time in most cases.

Actually both single (or very few) files and large amount of files are
practical setup. In MySQL 4.1 we have the option to store each Innodb
table in its own file, which will mean scattered random IO to many files
for OLTP workloads. 
You might think 128 actively used tables are still to much, but
practically we see even larger numbers - some customers partition data,
creating huge number of tables with same structure, for example
table-per customer.
