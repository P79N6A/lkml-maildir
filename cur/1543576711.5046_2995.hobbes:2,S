Looking at the patch, I'm practically sure it will cure the symptoms.
But I'm still slightly worried about those pages we skip in
there. Maybe we should at least try to discover what are those pages,
and then maybe it will become obvious what we need (or not) to do with
them.
Some strategic printk()s could probably give us some clue.
Too bad I lost track of the recent changes due to catastrofic time
shortage. And that is a shame as I'm very satisfied with the current
VM code, thanks to your hard work Rik.
