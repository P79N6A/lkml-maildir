Subject: -mm: strange places for the PERFCTR option
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/21/63

On i386, the PERFCTR option is currently available under:
  Power management options (ACPI, APM)
    APM (Advanced Power Management) BIOS Support
On x86_64, the PERFCTR option is currently available under:
  Executable file formats / Emulation
On ppc, the PERFCTR option is currently available under:
  Processor
On ppc64, the PERFCTR option is currently available under:
  Platform support
The ppc and ppc64 places seem to be logical, but the places where it's 
available on i386 and x86_64 are strange.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
