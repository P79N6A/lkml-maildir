Sorry, the kernel is 2.4.21-pre2. At first I had ACPI enabled, and it would 
not boot at all. The last kernel message was showing the ACPI info (release 
version, etc) and it just froze right there, no oops or anything. Now I have 
no power management whatsoever compiled in and I'm getting the hard drive 
errors. I can't boot it long enough to d/l hdparm to turn off DMA. I turned 
"32-bit I/O" off in the BIOS, now it locks within seconds of completely 
booting up. Any help is appreciated.
