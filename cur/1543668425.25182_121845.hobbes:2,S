Hi,Trond
I know myself that NFS is rather reliable for many yers, I was working 
for many years in HEP community (CERN/ALICE,FNAL/D0,JLAB/CLAS) and used 
NFS all the way processing uncounted terrabytes of data. BUT !!! 
Something in my current setup is triggering some hard to exibit problem. 
Mine previous problem with ARM board for example shows on ten physically 
different boards with several PC different in hardware and software. I 
really don't think it's only hardware problem (but it could be hardware 
related, i mean 3COM NIC's can somehow brighten this problem). Well , I 
don't really know what the hell is going on, That's why I'm calling for 
assistance.
Regards, Vladimir
