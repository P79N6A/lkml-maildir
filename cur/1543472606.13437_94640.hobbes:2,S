OK, I get your point on this one...

This sounds a bit like the philosophy behind WinModems
(the main processor is fast enough so why buy a DSP?).
While your idea is correct, you seem to be forgetting
the fact that disk transfers can be done in parallel
with useful CPU operations in other tasks.
Having to do (potentially a lot of, since you propose
losing 30% of useful memory) CPU costly compression
operations is definately not worth it on my system
(I/O and memory is in good balance with CPU and CPU is
usually a main bottleneck).
I agree it might be nice on those el-cheapo 300 MHz,
32 MB + EIDE Quantum Bigfoot garbage boxes, but I
really don't feel like optimizing the system to match
the insanity the people putting together that system
must have been in...

Linux supports these things.
