We are receiving frames with sequence number <= the ACK we're sending.
When the remote end receives those ACKs, it is seeing a series of
duplicate ACKs for data it sent about 5 frames ago.  So of course it
retransmits the data starting from 5 frames ago.  As it receives a whole
series of the same duplicate ACK, it retransmits from the same place
each time.
I don't see what is broken about the remote end in this case.

Actually, 5.2s is the most common packet interarrival time.  The RTT is
more like 23s!

Unfortunately I cannot change the IRTT on my ISP's mail server, or for
that matter on anyone's web server.
Are you saying that the IRTT must be larger than the actual RTT, and the
estimates can only go down?  I thought IRTT was a rough guess and it
was expected to go either up or down.
