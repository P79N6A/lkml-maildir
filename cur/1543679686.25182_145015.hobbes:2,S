I have a short question on that: did you check if there are any drawbacks on
network performance through this? We had a phenomenon here with 2.4.21 with
both samba and simple ftp where network performance dropped to a crawl when
simply entering "sync" on the console. Even simple telnet-sessions seemed to be
affected. As we could not create a reproducable setup I did not talk about this
up to now, but I wonder if anyone else ever checked that out ...
Regards,
Stephan
