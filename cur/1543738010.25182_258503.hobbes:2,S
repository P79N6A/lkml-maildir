But it is the issue.
Much can change between the select() and recvmsg - things outside of 
kernel control too, and it's long been known.

Standards can have bugs too.
It's not healthy to take a corner-case situation from the standard on 
select() and apply it globally to all IO. (not in my mind anyway, 
whatever the standard says).

You'll /still/ run into problems, on other platforms too. Set socket 
to O_NONBLOCK and deal with it ;)

POSIX_ME_HARDER? ;)

Like I said, to my mind, any sane app should try avoiding assumption 
that kernel state remains same between select() and read/write - and 
O_NONBLOCK exists to deal nicely with the situation.
You really shouldnt assume select state is guaranteed not to change 
by time you get round to doing IO. It's not safe, and not just on 
Linux - whatever POSIX says.
