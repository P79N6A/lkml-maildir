I've put some more effort on this issue last weekend. Here is the
result:
The codec I have is AD1881A. The additional delay makes a pretty
difference, right. Only the delay is enough to solve it.
However, I agree this is not the right solution. The codec_init_bits
solution does not work.
I have diff'ed the value of the codec registers and they are different
from all the other situations I tested, that are:
* booted my notebook: OK
* suspended, resumed, reloaded the driver: OK
* loaded the driver with no cold reset
  (no AC97_POWER_SAVE on intel8x0): OK
* same as above, after resuming: OK
* AC97_POWER_SAVE enabled (cold reset), after resume: NOT ok
As previously reported, even when probing, after loading the driver, we
get a different behaviour if we cold reset. When probing, we wait for
those HZ/4, which may explain why everything works.
I tested if ac97_resume was writing the same values to the same
registers if I had the delay or if I didn't. It was. However, the values
I read from /proc were still different, very similar to what the codec
specification refered to as the default values.
The best solution would be to do whatever is needed to do after cold
resetting that we are not doing, unless it is a hardware issue and the
driver can't really do anything about it but wait. Reading the Intel
ICH3 doc and AD1881A doc, I couldn't figure out anything that the driver
is doing wrong.
So, right now, the alternatives amount to:
* Wait for the HZ/4 additional delay. Probing is doing it and my
previously submitted patch does not add any delay for the probe case
and, it the resume case, it only adds a delay if we are cold resetting,
that is, AC97_POWER_SAVE is enabled.
* Do not do the cold reset at all. It works pretty well for me if ac97
power save is enabled and we only do a warm reset.
* Do only one of the above as a quirk for my controller or codec or
their combination.
Any help trying to figure out what's really happening, I'd appreciate.
If any more details of my tests are needed, I can collect and publish
them.
