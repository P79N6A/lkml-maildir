Where can I get some information on what changes need to be made to a
driver that would run under 2.0.x Kernels but insmod loads it and gets
2 unsats (outb and inb).  
Is there a 2.0.x to 2.2.x porting document of some sort?  I figured out
several things.
What I have is a 9 track tape unit driver for an Overland Data controller
if anyone is interested.  
Is this the right place to ask?
