Hi Alan,
> Because nobody has written it ?
i'm reading this mailing-ling for a long time now and i can remember
that the maintainer of the APM kernel-code (forgot his name, sorry)
posted
here a patch that switch back to real-mode before calling the power-down
APM function within the BIOS. Testing the new kernel showed that nothing
changed.
I thing that there are meny people that write to the kernel-code
maintainers
or does not know where they should post if there have trouble. Asking my
linux frinds, no one subscribed to linux-kernel list or any kind of nntp
board
so i write perhaps for many linux users on earth using linux :-)
How could i describe my problem ?! The best way would be a patch that
solve this
but with my expirience of linux-kernel programming ;) i thing i change
my computer
faster than program a working patch !
cu Raphael Bossek
