Good, so my assumption was incorrect which I am happy about. Since it 
makes the work we did more useful ;-)
Anyway in your case do you need diagnostic messages just from the kernel 
or from the firmware as well? To get it in the firmware the video boot 
code would need to be ported there (U-Boot has a version of it already, 
but it is the only firmware I am aware of that supports this).
