I agree, that per mount r/o is more important than unprivileged
mounts.  Especially because fixing up mount(8) and option showing in
/proc/mounts is really nowhere yet, both of which are needed to make
unprivileged mounting really useful.
So if that's convenient for you, just drop the unpriv mount patches,
and I'll resubmit sometime later.
