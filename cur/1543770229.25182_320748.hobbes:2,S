Oh, come on...
	ictx = kmalloc(sizeof(ntfs_index_context), GFP_NOFS);
	if (ictx)
		*ictx = (ntfs_index_context){.idx_ni = idx_ni};
	return ictx;
and be done with that.  Let compiler do its job.  And yes, that *will*
give properly initialized pointers even for weird platforms.  Not that
we had the slightest chance of porting to any of them...

So use the proper constructs.  Variant above is guaranteed to do the right
thing on any C99 compiler, provided that kmalloc() returns NULL or pointer
to object sufficiently large and properly aligned for ntfs_index_context.
All missing fields will be initialized the same way they would for initializer
of a static object.
