The problem I see is that the code uses a CONFIG option, to change the
behaviour of the generic 8250 driver. What happens if somebody adds a
PCI serial card to a tsi108 based machine?
Perhaps you should define a new value for uart_8250_port.port.iotype,
and add code to serial_in and serial_out to handle the IIR register.
