If a system normally runs a watchdog, and some do, then nmi would be 
forced on by grub.comf and the system would not boot. And if the system 
was counting on nmi to look for a hanging problem, "nmi does not work" 
would be a real problem if the failure was silent.
Actually, a lack of nmi would be worse than not booting, it would be a 
time bomb waiting for a bad moment to hang.
