Hi,
I've got the same probelm with my K6-III 450, too...
The last version I tested was 2.5.52 and it worked perfektly...
But now with 2.5.54 (I did not test 2.5.53) when the 'nvidia' module is used 
(loading it works with no problems...) the Computer reboots...
If I do not use this module X works...
There seems to be a problem with an other module, too...
'nfsd' is ok to load, but when a remote machine tries to mount a directory a 
reboot occures, too...
I do not know if there is a problem with other modules, if I will find any I 
will report them here...
