Please use your eyes, not your tool. Those functions are called in 2.6.20
static struct cmac *ixf1010_mac_create(adapter_t *adapter, int index)
{
...
	mac->ops = &ixf1010_ops;
static struct cmac *mac_create(adapter_t *adapter, int index)
{
...
	mac->ops = &chelsio_mac_ops;
mac_create gets called by 
int __devinit t1_init_sw_modules(adapter_t *adapter,
				 const struct board_info *bi)
{
	for_each_port(adapter, i) {
		u8 hw_addr[6];
		struct cmac *mac;
		int phy_addr = bi->mdio_phybaseaddr + i;
		adapter->port[i].phy = bi->gphy->create(adapter, phy_addr,
							bi->mdio_ops);
