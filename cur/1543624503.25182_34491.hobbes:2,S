Get patches from usual place 
(
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/vmware/,
 update8 is currently latest). You 
must have VMware 3.0, as I do not (and nobody else does AFAIK) support 
VMware 2.0 on 2.5.x kernels - you need to patch VMware binary to put 
sysinfo() call into it, instead of parsing /proc/meminfo contents, which 
changed before 2.5.1 (yes, they did not learn from 2.3.24 /proc/meminfo 
lesson :-( ) and I have no interest in fixing it in old version. 
VMware 3.1 will work on 2.5.6. I have no idea about future kernels, as 
always...
If you are using VMware on oficially unsupported kernels, please
visit nntp://news.vmware.com/vmware.for-linux.experimental, you'll find
couple of your possible questions answered there.
And as always - there is no warranty, and I have no idea whether it is
legal to use my patch in the U.S.
                                            Best regards,
                                                  Petr Vandrovec
