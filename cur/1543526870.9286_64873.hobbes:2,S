I'm trying to run bridging as per the mini-howto in a 2.2.13
system.  I seem unable to get the necessary BRCFG program,
which once lived on 
ftp://shadow.cabi.net
.
There was some controversy about US access to this site,
and I don't know if that is the problem, or if the plug just
got pulled.  Anyway, that seems to be the sole source, so 
what can a po' boy to do to get brcfg? 
With brcfg so, uh, awkward to get, should this be taken as
a sign that bridging is not an interesting, kept-up-to-date
feature?   
It's been suggested that CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY
would work too, but a simple bridge is really what I have 
in mind, crossing a wireless net to the local ether.
thanks,
