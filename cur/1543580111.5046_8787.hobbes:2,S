Devices above md8 will not be initialized when speced with md=.
Error ("md: Minor device number too high.\n");
The limitation is imposed by
        #define MAX_MD_BOOT_DEVS        8
However it appears arbitray to me. Doesn't make much sence since you can create
/dev/md100 and it may well be the only md device you have...
Is there any reason the next 2.4.1 prepatch should not include this?
-#define MAX_MD_BOOT_DEVS       8
+#define MAX_MD_BOOT_DEVS       MAX_MD_DEVS
(If not I assume you will be submitting this to Linus...)
