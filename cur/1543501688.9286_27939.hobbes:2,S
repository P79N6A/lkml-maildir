I have never been able to get dhcpd's BOOTP services to work correctly. 
With the X-terms at an old job, and with my Alpha kernel (loaded via
bootp), I had to use CMU's bootpd in order to get things working
properly.  In particular I seem to recall dhcpd's BOOTP support missing
a tag or two.
With respect to timeouts, though, there is one thing to watch for:  your
bootp requests may be succeeding, but the tftp step following the BOOTP
reply may be failing.  Some
