I noticed something weird ping flooding lo:
Linux mbit.doa.org 2.2.1-ac5 #1 Sun Feb 7 03:17:53 CET 1999 i686 unknown
13 day uptime

Notice the constant 766 packets received.
Also tcpdump lists everything twice:
12:31:57.592092 localhost > localhost: icmp: echo reply
12:31:57.592092 localhost > localhost: icmp: echo reply
12:31:57.592199 localhost > localhost: icmp: echo request
12:31:57.592199 localhost > localhost: icmp: echo request
(single ping)
