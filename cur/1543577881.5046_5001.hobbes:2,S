Subject: 2.4: header file confusion (interrupts)

Inspecting some code I found out that in 2.4.0test12
request_irq() is declared in sched.h, and not in interrupt.h,
SA_SHIRQ is declared in asm/signal.h, and not in interrupt.h
Isn't that a bit confusing? Maybe for 2.5 let's re-sort some things to 
clean up dependencies...

Ulrich
