But other tasks can do a getaffinity() on it and see the wrong affinity.
Probably not a big issue.

I agree with Ingo: it's clever, well done.  Minor nitpicks:
+void migrate_all_tasks(int cpu)
 {
        struct task_struct *tsk, *t;
        int dest_cpu, src_cpu;
        unsigned int node;
 
-       /* We're nailed to this CPU. */
-       src_cpu = smp_processor_id();
+       src_cpu = cpu;
Just make the parameter name "src_cpu"?
+               /* Take idle task off runqueue and restore it's
+                * policy/priority
+                */
+               rq = task_rq_lock(rq->idle, &flags);
+
+               /* Call init_idle instead ?? init_idle doesn't restore
the
+                * policy though for us ..
+                */
+               deactivate_task(rq->idle, rq);
+               __setscheduler(rq->idle, SCHED_NORMAL, MAX_PRIO);
+
+               task_rq_unlock(rq, &flags);
One-line comments and compact code good:
		/* Idle task back to normal (off runqueue, low prio) */
		rq = task_rq_lock(rq->idle, &flags);
		deactivate_task(rq->idle, rq);
		__setscheduler(rq->idle, SCHED_NORMAL, MAX_PRIO);
		task_rq_unlock(rq, &flags);
+               /* Force scheduler to switch to idle task when we yield.
+                * We expect idle task to _immediately_ notice that it's
cpu
+                * is offline and die quickly.
+                *
+                * This allows us to defer calling mirate_all_tasks
until
+                * CPU_DEAD notification time.
+                */
+               sched_idle_next();
This comment's very big.  They don't need to know all the things we
don't do.  I'd prefer:
		/* Force idle task to run as soon as we yield: it should
		   immediately notice cpu is offline and die quickly. */
I'm happy for this to go in..
