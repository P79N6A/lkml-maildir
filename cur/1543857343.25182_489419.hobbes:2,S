Ok. Pulled, pushed out.
There was some noise saying that this may actually fix the problems with 
the NVidia "Intel HDA" sound situation? Can people who saw that issue try 
it out whether this just makes MSI works for them?
Takashi added to the To: field, because he hopefully remembers and has a 
clue about the proper identities in question.. Iirc, you needed to have 
not only a NVidia chipset, but also have the legacy interrupt shared with 
some other device to see the problem.
