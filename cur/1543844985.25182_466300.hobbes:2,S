That would be too late. Those "constants"[1] are part of the actual PCI
bus setup. I have some patches to push most of them into
drivers/pci/quirks.c. We cannot use platform devices for this in most
cases because we already have a device for it - the PCI one.
In the non PCI case we can use platform devices and we do, but the
platform device itself has to know what I/O ports are being used so you
end up back with the "constants".
The old IDE layer works this way too except that it doesn't use platform
devices at all.
