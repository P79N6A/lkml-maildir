  Is there any way to completely purge the buffer
cache -- not just the write requests (ala 'sync' or
'update'), but the whole thing?  Can I just call
invalidate_buffers() or destroy_buffers()?
  I know, why in the world would a person do such a
thing?  Research.  It'd be easier for me to write a
little program or add it to a module than wait for a
reboot each time I need a clean buffer cache.
  Thanks in advance,
	Al
