Just a heads up, as I haven't seen anything on the mailing list.  Build
of '19-rc4-mm2, with the one existing 'acpi-verify-lapic...' hotfix,
breaks on ia64 because generic file drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c
includes <asm/apic.h>.  ia64 uses acpi in which processor_idle.[co] is
not optional, but has no arch specific apic.h [in this tree, anyway].
Looks like it's only needed if ARCH_APICTIMER_STOPS_ON_C3 is defined, so
I've worked around it by creating an empty one.  Maybe not the
appropriate fix.
