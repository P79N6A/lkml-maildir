Line 56 describes the Magic Close feature that has been introduced by
(I believe) Jakob Oestergaard. This feature is an extra safety that was
added to make sure that if the watchdog daemon crashes the system is not
left "uncontrolled".
So what should the behaviour be:
1) when the watchdog driver is initialized it should make sure that
the watchdog driver is not running for userspace.
2) when /dev/watchdog is opened the watchdog device should start
3) the watchdog is being kept alive by pinging it
4) when /dev/watchdog is closed and the driver received the magic char "V"
(this is when you support the magic-close feature off-course) then the
watchdog device should stop.
5) if you unload the watchdog driver module then you normally stop
the watchdog device also (unless CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT or the nowayout
module param is specified).
Hope this makes it clear now,
Greetings,
Wim.
