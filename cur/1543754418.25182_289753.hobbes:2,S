I don't really like it in general when we do
#define MAYBE_CONST_LOOKING_THING      (some_func())
I would almost rather see something like task_size(current) used.

ia64 asm/processor.h already has:
#define DEFAULT_TASK_SIZE       __IA64_UL_CONST(0xa000000000000000)
[...]
#define MM_VM_SIZE(mm)          DEFAULT_TASK_SIZE
So I think this will generate a warning there?
