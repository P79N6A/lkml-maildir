I do not think all the review comments have been addressed, for
example my earlier comments about GFP_ATOMIC and spin_lock_irqsave
[1].  We have two options to take this forward:
1/ Continue to carry this in the async-tx tree and get an
Acked-by/Reviewed-by tag from Kumar.
2/ Move this to Kumar's tree, and coordinate our pull requests to have
the async-tx updates hit first.
I prefer option 1, but I will defer to Kumar.
Thanks,
Dan
