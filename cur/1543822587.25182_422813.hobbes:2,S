I was able to replicate the Bug, even when all the drivers are built into the kernel. 
It looks like while traversing through p->parent field of resource structure is leading to NULL pointer. 
Would it be appropriate to make the following code change. 
	But I found cat /proc/iomem hangs after line kernel data..
