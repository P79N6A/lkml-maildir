If you want to do it preserving all the BK info, i.e., a pull with some
option to send a particular changeset, that doesn't work.  BK has an 
invariant which is that the parent of any changeset you send must be
present in the receiving repository or it won't work.
What you want to do is cherrypick, to do that with BK you have two choices:
    a) wait for LODs
    b) export as a patch and import as a patch.
The second one works fine but causes problems over the long run, especially
with file creates.
