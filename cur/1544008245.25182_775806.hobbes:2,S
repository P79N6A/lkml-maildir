Well, I don't have to install special userland to make USB keyboard to
work,  and I don't see why remote controls should be different.

It is more complex in the obscure case, agreed; but the common case
gets simpler and I believe tradeoff is worth it.

Remote controls do look like keyboards; that's why people want to use
input layer.
Unlike normal keyboards, 'tcpdump' or 'irdump' makes a lot of sense
for remote controls, but so what?

I don't see why we could not use Jon's code for common remotes decoded
mostly by hw, and your code for the obscure cases.
