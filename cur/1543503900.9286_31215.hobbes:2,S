i'm thinking a better way to do this might be to clear the page reference
bit behind the actual faulting page, but only as long as we're scheduling
read-ahead I/Os.  in other words, save metadata about the previously read
ahead data so that those pages can be marked as unreferenced once we know
it's OK to continue reading ahead.
