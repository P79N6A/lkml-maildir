`apt-get dist-upgrade` seems to do wonders for making a system
thoroughly unusable. Possibly because it forks a copy of perl and a
few other tasks, all competing for CPU and disk I/O bandwidth -- at
least, competing when they're not sleeping most of the time. Y'all
might add a chroot'd install of Debian as a test case.
