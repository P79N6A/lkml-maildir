I agree with avoiding the use of thread_info when the stack might be
corrupt.  However your patch results in reading apic data and scanning
NR_CPU sized tables for each IPI that is sent, which will slow down the
sending of all IPIs, not just dump.  It would be far cheaper to define
a per-cpu variable containing the logical cpu number, set that variable
once as each cpu is brought up and just read it in cases where you
might not trust the integrity of struct thread_info.  safe_smp_processor_id()
resolves to just a read of the per cpu variable.
