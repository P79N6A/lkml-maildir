Yes.  (Unit of size if the sector - and things don't have to
be aligned nicely, just aligned to sector.)
IIRC the merge function assumes the number of bytes that can
be added is only a function of the offset: but in our case
it's also a function of time.  To make this work it should
reserve those bytes with device-mapper, and guarantee either to 
supply them to us subsequently (and preferably quickly) or to 
cancel that reservation.  Device-mapper for its part would
guarantee to accept the bio without needing to split it.
Or dm could have a rejection mechanism that refuses bios
that are too big (because the max number of bytes we accept
got reduced between the initial call and the bio actually being 
presented) and they go back and get processed again.
