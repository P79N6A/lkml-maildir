If there is a stress test I can use, I can try running it.

Hmm...the arithmetic becomes tricky then.  Right now I allocate
NR_CPUS * PCU_BLOCKSIZE + BLOCK_MANAGEMENT_SIZE amount of KVA for a block,
allocate pages for cpu_possible cpus and map corresponding va space
with allocated pages using map_vm_area.  We may fragment if
NR_CPUS * PCPU_BLOCKSIZE doesn't fit into a proper page order,
also we'd be wasting pages for !cpu_possible(cpus) of NR_CPUS
Thanks,
