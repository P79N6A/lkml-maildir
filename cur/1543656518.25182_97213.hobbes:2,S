Subject: [PATCH] add kobject to struct mapped_device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here's a simple patch against 2.5.52 that adds the kobject structure to
struct mapped_device.  I did this for two reasons:
	- kobject provides proper reference counting for a structure
	  (not saying that struct mapped_device didn't get this correct,
	  but it's nice to use the core for these things).
	- This lets us tie into the block layer better to describe the
	  dm devices.
I originally hacked something together that added dm attributes to the
block devices themselves, but that wasn't proper, as it forced the dm
code to dig into the gendisk core too intrusively.  With this patch, it
is very easy to make a dm object be a child of the proper struct gendisk
object (which it already is logically, but that representation isn't
exported to userspace yet.)  Then, the dm specific attributes of the
gendisk object will show up in sysfs properly, under the associated
block device.
Anyway, Joe, please add this to your set of patches to send on to Linus.
Oh, and why isn't struct mapped_device declared in dm.h?  If it was,
dm_get and dm_put could be inlined, along with a few other potential
cleanups.
thanks,
greg k-h
