Ok, so we add this as solution 2.(c) to the reply I just sent to Jan :-)
But I still prefer 2.(b) -- making the config scripts intelligent so that if a
given "menuconfig FOO depends on BAR", then all the "config BAZ"s
inside this menuconfig also automatically "depend on" BAR too.
This is simpler in the long run because it requires least amount
(actually none) of redundant typing and would continue to work in
the future if/when the:
menuconfig FOO
if FOO
...
endif # FOO
idiom is converted to an:
configmenu FOO
...
endconfigmenu # FOO
kind of idiom ...
