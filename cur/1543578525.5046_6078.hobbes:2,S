Hm, the noapic option seems to help, as I'm currently beating the network to
death but it won't die... As the problem is elusive, it is hard to tell, and it
would not surprise me if the net dropped dead the moment this mail went
through, but current indication is that noapic makes the sudden net-death
disappear.
So.... we're still left with the question 'is this hardware-related, or is it a
software/configuration problem'? Other people seem to have similar problems
with dissimilar hardware (tulip cards instead of Winbond, etc), on 2.2.x as
well as 2.3/4.x. As I do not run Windows (NT or 2K), I can not tell if this
problem also occurs there. And my FreeBSD-box is uniprocessor... So... has
anyone seen anything like this on other 'true' (SMP) OS's? If so, that would
indicate a hardware problem...
Cheers//Frank
