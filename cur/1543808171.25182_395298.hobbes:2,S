    Matthias Andree posted such a patch last week, and he was ignored
by Joerg. In fact, he got an answer of "I haven't looked at it and I
never will" or something like that (check the list archives).
    Joerg was offered help to maintain a bit of code he doesn't want
to maintain and rejected it.

    cdrecord is a good tool, no doubt about that. IMHO it can be
improved by changing the user interface and getting rid of useless
warnings, but nonetheless it is a good tool. The problem is Joerg
attitude...
