Yes, that's it.
When idr_get_new_above(,,64,) is called, the idr code creates a tree 
with 2 layers, without the entry 0 in layer 1.
This was special-cased [without comments], I missed it.
I've just send you a patch, could you try it?
It passes self tests [including idr_get_new_above and idr_replace].
