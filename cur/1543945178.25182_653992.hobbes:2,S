Comparing with kernel 2.6.24, tbench result has regression with
2.6.25-rc1.
1) On 2 quad-core processor stoakley: 4%.
2) On 4 quad-core processor tigerton: more than 30%.
bisect located below patch.

    [IPV6]: Move nfheader_len into rt6_info
    The dst member nfheader_len is only used by IPv6.  It's also currently
    creating a rather ugly alignment hole in struct dst.  Therefore this patch
    moves it from there into struct rt6_info.
As tbench uses ipv4, so the patch's real impact on ipv4 is it deletes
nfheader_len in dst_entry. It might change cache line alignment.
To verify my finding, I just added nfheader_len back to dst_entry in 2.6.25-rc1
and reran tbench on the 2 machines. Performance could be recovered completely.
I started cpu_number*2 tbench processes. On my 16-core tigerton:
#./tbench_srv &
#./tbench 32 127.0.0.1
