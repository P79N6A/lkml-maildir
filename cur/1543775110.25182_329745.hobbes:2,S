A couple more tidbits of information on this problem.
1) I have seen this on two different boards
a Tyan S4882 and a Arima HDAMA, with and without linuxbios.
In just messing around adding "debug" on the kernel command line
or changing Dprintk in smpboot.c:smp_callin() to printk,
avoids this boot lock up for me.
