Are "DRIs" the best available open-source drivers for
old ATI cards ? Done by reverse engineering ?
And not all functions are usable :-(.
What about newer ATI or Nvidia cards ? A hope for
something better ?
What do you think of using binary drivers (blobs)
instead ?
I think thats sad to use them, in an open-source
kernel like Linux.
By the way : did you know of this project about an
"open source graphic card" ?
Hardware specs are open, so no need of DNA and
open-source drivers coding easier :

http://lists.duskglow.com/mailman/listinfo/open-graphics
(still a project).
