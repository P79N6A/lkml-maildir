If a device is registered after dpm_suspend() has returned, the
device won't be suspended properly before the system goes to sleep.  
If the device has a parent then you're okay, because the parent must
already be suspended and so device_pm_add() will fail.  But if the
device doesn't have a parent then device_pm_add() will succeed, which
you don't want.

What would happen the very first time the system registers a device 
during startup?
