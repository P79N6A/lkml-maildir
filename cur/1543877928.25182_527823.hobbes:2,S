I think it's nice to roll up fixes into patches that haven't been
merged upstream yet.  For example I try to avoid merging series like
  Add feature A
  Add feature B
  Fix 1 for feature A
  Fix 2 for feature A
  Fix for fix 1 for feature A
because that means I already knew the first patch was broken before it
ever got merged.  And it's better to avoid setting any more booby
traps for people trying to use git bisect or something like
that... enough bugs get merged by accident without us merging known
bugs.  So before I merge, I go back and create a new series like
  Add fixed feature A
  Add feature B
