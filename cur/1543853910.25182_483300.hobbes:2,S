Strange.  x86_64 has that stray exit_idle() in smp_error_interrupt() but
afaict it won't cause this to happen.
What's that idle_notifier doing in x86_64 anyway?  It appears to have no
users.  If there _is_ a user, and if its IDLE_END handler is altering the
preempt-count then perhaps there's your explanation.
But it all appears to be dead code to me.
