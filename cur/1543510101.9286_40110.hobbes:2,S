	As someone else has already reported, I'm having problems when
mounting the ZIP under kernels 2.3.18ac5-ac7 (haven't tested ac1-ac4), the
thing is that I get not info on in because it just hangs up, but after
applying Ingo new SMP patch I get a NMI Watchdog LOCKUP on CPU0 just after
the kernel get hanged up (when mounting the ZIP). If it will help I can copy
additional info (registers) displayed when the LOCKUP occurs.
