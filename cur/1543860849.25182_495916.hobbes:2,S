Oh I see. 
This seems like a lot of extra code to avoid passing one extra arg to
the driver's req_notify_cq verb.  I'd appreciate other folk's input on
how important they think this is.  
If you insist, then I'll run some tests specifically in kernel mode and
see how this affects mthca's req_notify performance.
