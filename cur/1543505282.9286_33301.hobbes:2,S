that makes 3 of us, yet we all use the serial mouse.. I do know
that there are many others and not all of them use the serial
mouse, some us the PS/2 mouse, and some have reported keyboard
bugs also... 
let me state that:
1) yes a serial mouse will go bezerk and it will <EM>NOT
NECESSARILY</EM> affect your keyboard. This is probably becuase
the data for the serial mouse is not connected to the keyboard
data in any way, it is a serial port.
2) If you are using a PS/2 mouse it MAY, and I stress
<em>MAY</em> affect your keyboard also if the buffer for the
PS/2 mouse gets corrupted as most PS/2 and keyboard connections
are somehow connected
3) someone suggested hardware, however I do not think that is
case else I'd have seen this is 2.0 kernels somewhere along the
way in the past 3 years.. I also ran the 2.0 kernel with both X
3.3.2 thru 3.3.3.1 ...
I do believe that this is a kernel bug, and the more I look into
this and talk with people the more it seems to be a data
corruption issue somewhere.. someone on the X-develop list had
said that X calls a wrapper function to tcflush() but I think
they said this was called when X starts up?? that would explain
whey killing X and restarting it fixes the mouse.. but then why
would switching to a console fix this? does this also flush the
buffer somehow? (I think it must cause on the console you'd use
gpm, not the X mouse driver, right?)
also I think I was told not to run gpm when I run X, so maybe it
would be a good idea if the X startup scripts would include in
the  script:
if (ps -aux|grep gpm|grep -v grep) then
    gpm -k
fi
although I am not sure which script this would / could go in?
for the record, this bezerko mouse problems is not when X starts
up it is after X has been up for while at least a few minutes,
and when you are actually doing something. I think most who have
experienced this can attest to this... 
on a slightly off topic question.. this weekend I got a
trackball.. I noticed under NT that I could use either the
trackball or the serial mouse in the same NT session. ie move
the serial mouse, then use the trackball and both worked. the
trackball is a PS/2  and the mouse is a serial mouse.. this does
not seem to work under Linux :-( it seems to be an either / or
situation.. gpm would only run one device, and X only lets you
select one device (afaik), are there any plans to include
multiple pointing devices usage in and out of X?
