Hi Sam,
This apparently doesn't build:
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  UPD     include/linux/version.h
  HOSTCC  scripts/basic/fixdep
  HOSTCC  scripts/basic/docproc
  HOSTCC  scripts/unifdef
/tmp/ccwcmPxS.o: In function `keywordedit':
unifdef.c:(.text+0x25c): undefined reference to `strlcpy'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [scripts/unifdef] Error 1
make: *** [headers_install] Error 2
AFAICT, strlcpy is a BSD'ism and isn't generally available to userland on
Linux (but of course the kernel has its own strlcpy implementation).
Debian solve this by including a separate strlcpy.c with the unifdef
source. See:
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/u/unifdef/unifdef_1.0
+20030701.orig.tar.gz

Greg
