OK.  After talking with Daniel Jacobowitz abit about this, the '?'
packet will only be sent once per session.  So this is how we have to
deal with disconnect / gdb dying.  I'll re-work the patch a bit to
reflect this.

How about something like the following:
putpacket(msg)
{
 if (!kgdb_connected)
  return; /* No one wants this */
 
 do {
   /* Write out $pack#checksum */
   ch = kgdb_get_debug_char();
   if (ch == '+' /* ACK */ || ch == '$' /* Packet before an ACK?
                                           must be a reattach. */ )
    return;
 }
}
With the suggested change for the ? packet, we quickly get to the point
where we're back in kgdb_handle_exception() and will know this is a
restart shortly.
