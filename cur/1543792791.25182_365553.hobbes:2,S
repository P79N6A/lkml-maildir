argh.
Really, I'd prefer to abandon gcc-2.95.x rather than this.  Look:
struct a
{
	union {
		struct {
			int b;
			int c;
		};
		int d;
	};
} z;
main()
{
	z.b = 1;
	z.d = 1;
}
It does everything we want.
Of course, it would be nice to retain 2.95.x support.  The reviled
page_private(() would help us do that.  But the now-to-be-reviled
page_mapping() does extraneous stuff, and we'd need a ton of page_lru()'s.
So it'd be a big patch, converting page->lru to page->u.s.lru in lots of
places.
But I think either a big patch or 2.95.x abandonment is preferable to this
approach.
