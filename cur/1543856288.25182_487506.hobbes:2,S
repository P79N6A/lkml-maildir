Subject: [PATCH 4/36] CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>
Provide a way to support older versions of udev that are shipped in
older distros.  If this option is disabled, it will also turn off the
compatible symlinks in sysfs that older programs might rely on.
When in doubt, or if running a distro older than 2006, say Yes here.

+	  This option creates deprecated symlinks such as the
+	  "device"-link, the <subsystem>:<name>-link, and the
+	  "bus"-link. It may also add deprecated key in the
+	  uevent environment.
+	  None of these features or values should be used today, as
+	  they export driver core implementation details to userspace
+	  or export properties which can't be kept stable across kernel
+	  releases.
+
+	  If enabled, this option will also move any device structures
+	  that belong to a class, back into the /sys/class heirachy, in
+	  order to support older versions of udev.
+
+	  If you are using a distro that was released in 2006 or later,
+	  it should be safe to say N here.
