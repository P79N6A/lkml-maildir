They wouldn't technically be Linux system calls, but LXRT system
calls.  They also don't tend to be any faster; they just happen
to be RT-safe.
The nice thing about RT-safe is that means it is thread-safe and
lock-free.  So an RT-safe version of gettimeofday() could easily
be a replacement for the current gettimeofday.  But that would
require real-time support in the kernel.
