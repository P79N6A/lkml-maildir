If they only need them at open, and the open is synchronous, you don't
need to copy them.
Otherwise, if you need them in other syscall, or in another context, you
probably need to copy them, that only costs an additional 2 long copies.

There is copy-on-write for the groups array.
The idea is that anything that takes little time to use should be in the
copy-always structure, while things that need a long time to access
(e.g. groups, lsm data) and/or are big, stay in the copy-on-write
structure referenced from the copy-always one.
