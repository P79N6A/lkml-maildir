  Formalized, required documentation, of the sort where each function *MUST*
be commented with pre- and post-conditions, arguments, return value,
algorithms used, expected execution times, stack space required, opcodes
needed, and all that garbage have no place in the kernel, I agree.
  However, nobody suggested *that*.
  Requiring kernel developers to write man pages for everything in the kernel
is silly, I agree.  If someone wants to, I say let 'em go ahead.  I see no
objection to documentation *if* the code is also good.  See below.
  The original poster wanted man pages for some kernel things.  I cannot blame
him; it would be nice.  However, no one has since said that all kernel hackers
should be required to write those man pages for him.
  What has been suggested is a standard method of marking source comments so
that an automated tool could gather those comments and generate man-page-like
output for developers, which is a nice idea.  If someone does not want to use
these tools, they do not have to, but it is nice to have them if you want
them.

  I do not consider those people programmers.
  If someone submits crap to be included in the kernel, they will be told
'No'.  This is nothing new.

  Have you ever *read* Microsoft's documentation?  I consider it all crap.  
It is incomplete, incorrect, hard to read, wordy, typically out-of-date, and
often expensive.  However, everyone seems to understand that crap has no place
in the kernel, and that extends to kernel docs as well.
