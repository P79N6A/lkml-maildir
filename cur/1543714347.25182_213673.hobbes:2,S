As Andrew mentioned, this isn't a fast path at all. You are potentially
even going to block on this call, and even if you don't you'll end up
spending a butt load of cycles in the io scheduler.

The last one will be 'caught' at the other end of io completion, so I
guess that could be killed (even though you already lost the context of
the error, then). The first two are buffer state errors, I think those
should be kept unconditionally.

I'm fine with killing the buffer_error(), maybe
	if (rw == WRITE && !buffer_uptodate(bh))
		buffer_error();
should be kept though.
