As may noatime.  noatime only prevents the automatic update
of atime on read.  It doesn't (at least in my experience)
prevent utime(2) from updating the atime field.
Using noatime works quite well with at least with mutt which
explicitly uses utime(2) to update atime.  I cannot be
certain but mutt may actually work better with noatime
because then other tools (*biff &co) accesses won't break the
mailer's notion of new mail (mtime > atime).
