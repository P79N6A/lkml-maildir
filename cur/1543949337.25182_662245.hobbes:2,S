Hi,
2 items:
1) lkml is not a tutorial list for how to write rootkits
2) you forgot to point to your full source code; hooking the system call table
   is the wrong thing to do, but by not mentioning your (GPL) source code you
   don't give us the option to give you suggestions on how to achieve what you
   want.
I would suggest you come back to this mailing list with more context on what you
are trying to achieve including a pointer to the source code.
