I tested Andrew's patch and panic was gone but got few ENOTBLK.
So I tried with Joe's patch , both panic and ENOTBLK are gone now.
But in Joe's patch if (ret == -ENOTBLK && (rw & WRITE)), dio_cleanup(dio)
was not getting called because of break. So I moved dio_cleanup just 
after if (ret).
I tested with this patch, both panic and ENOTBLK are gone now.
Here is the modified patch:
