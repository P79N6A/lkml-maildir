This is normally only the case on a laptop, where the cable is 
essentially just a tiny stub between the motherboard and the drive. I 
suspect this is something that the system manufacturer has to validate 
works properly, more than any hard and fast limit.
For a normal desktop PC, it would be far better to just use an 80-wire 
cable.
