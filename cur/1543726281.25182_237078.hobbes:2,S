I was asking so I could give a better answer.
As far as I can tell the long term solution is to simply run the
dumper from memory that reserved in the kernel that called panic().
At that point you might get a corrupt DUMP. But it is extremely
unlikely any DMA transactions will touch your reserved memory.
Only the most buggy drivers or hardware will be running
DMA to the invalid addresses.  At which point there is
very little you can do in any event.
