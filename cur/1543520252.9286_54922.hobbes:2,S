Because the kernel does not know that the incoming packet and the outgoing
packet are in any way related (UDP has no connection between packets, it
is all in above layers if at all). The routing table doesn't say anything 
about it. So the only way to get the semantics you want is to change bind
to receive the incoming interface with the IP_PKTINFO cmsg, look at the 
ipi_ifindex and set it for outgoing packets on the same conversation to the 
same interface.
