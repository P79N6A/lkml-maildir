Here is the "GEEK" secret on the REV 2 v/s REV 1 differences.
There are no markings or gerber date markers for the PCB house that I know
about.  The only way that I know tell the difference is to look at the
socket 370 design.
REV 1 used metal lever arms.
CPU fan headers are marked backwards, imperical tests by me.
REV 2 uses (first production run) plastic lever arms.
New lanes to the CPU fan headers make them report correctly now.
I told this was a true geek secret........
There is one more method but it is not verifable, thus I will have to hunt
for another third check.
