Which are the same as in the initial post.

The thing that makes me curious is that the RH 5.1 default didn't
showed the specific behaviour (identical hardware setup). This
happened with the install of RH 6.0 (from scratch). With regards to
holding off memory refresh the is a test routine in AHA1542 bios and
my current setting (6mb/s) passed that test.
