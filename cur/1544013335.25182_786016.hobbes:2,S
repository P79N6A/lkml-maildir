Yeah, my bad for thinking tux3 was a video game
(don't ask why); I need to get glasses!!
When I was told it was a filesystem it clicked.
As for the atomic commit Thanks for explanation.
(I honestly had no idea what that meant);
with test and playing around with this, I have
an old dell inspiron hanging around, when
I have the time I'll have to give it a try.
Do I have to wipe out the ext3 partition
on it, or is that O.K.
