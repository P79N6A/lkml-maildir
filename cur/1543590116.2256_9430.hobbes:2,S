I don't think it's a good idea. You either need a lot of hooks in the
arp input path for all the different cases or you would need to replicate
a lot of the arp.c logic into that netfilter module. Both not good.
IMHO it's better to just control replies via the routing table,
which already has all kinds of fancy mechanisms for it. In addition I haven't
seen a setup yet that couldn't be handled by arpfilter and the routing
table, it seems to be flexible enough for all practical purposes.
