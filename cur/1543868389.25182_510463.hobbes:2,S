Sure, I will. I guess I am short circuiting my thinking process :-)

Yes, that makes sense.

The container cannot be freed unless all tasks holding references to it are
gone, that would ensure that all mm->containers are pointing elsewhere and
never to a stale value.
I hope my short-circuited brain got this right :-)
