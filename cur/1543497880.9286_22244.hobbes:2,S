Hi Albert.

One of my computers is a Compaq EISA system with an AMD 486dx4/100
processor, and a BIOS that allows boot from CD, so there's at least
two of the above that are faulty assumptions.
Add to that the fact that motherboards with flash BIOS exist that
support 486 processors upwards, and note that CD boot is a BIOS
feature, not a motherboard one, and your apparently nice clear
equation becomes extremely muddy...
Best wishes from Riley.
