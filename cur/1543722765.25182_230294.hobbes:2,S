Well as it stands, it's already syslog compatible, as the priority level
component of the syslog protocol is optional. I've made a point of
_defining_ the netconsole protocol as syslog (note the default port)
so that this could be done at a later date. Thus, I don't think a new
command line option is necessary.
On the other hand, for this to have real value, we need to provide
real priority levels. Which means we need to plug it in higher in the
printk framework so that we a) get all messages by default and b) get
them before the levels are stripped off. I had this in an earlier
version but dropped it as being too intrusive for 2.6.0 merger.
Also, if we're going to go to the trouble of being more completely
syslog-like, it's very useful (and trivial) to throw in the hostname
as well. Timestamp is slightly more difficult, but also worth
considering.
