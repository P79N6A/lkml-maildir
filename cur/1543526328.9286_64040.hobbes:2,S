Subject: 210ms interval between two schedule() calls - is it possible?

I did a very simple timing experiement: measure the interval between 
two consequtive calls to schedule() function.
Under light load situation, the maximum interval is around 10ms which is 
the time slicing interval.  However, if I increase the load (actually I
was running NIST POSIX test suite), the maximum interval could go
up to 210ms.
Is this possbile?  Should the kernel at very least obey the time
slicing,
which I expect schedule() should be called no more than every 10ms.
Can someone shed a light on this?
