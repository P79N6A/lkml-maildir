This imposes quite a significant overhead for the common case (in which 
the application has specifically requested that the parent process be 
terminated after the child process is fork()ed off). Even if the cost of 
transferring memory contents was cheap (which it isn't), you'd annoy the 
memory management subsystem unless you did a lot of weird tricks to 
avoid allocating from a large block.

Well, in fact just having a libc that does not define a symbol for 
"fork" and then going to the places the linker mentions as having 
undefined references is a pretty easy way. Mind you, in 90% of cases you 
can replace them by a vfork() and be done.
