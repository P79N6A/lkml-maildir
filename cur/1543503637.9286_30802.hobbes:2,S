Hehe:)
It is actually not that bad, you can simply wrap it, like Pedro did in
net/ipv4/sysctl_net_ipv4.c:ipv4_sysctl_forward()

Ooops.
Seems nobody uses the system call...
Ok, so proc_dointvec_jiffies is broken by design and the proposal above
is wrong.
Fortunately most net variables don't need a transformation/state setup,
so only proc_dointvec_jiffies and rtcache_flush needs fixing I think, or 
did I miss something?
