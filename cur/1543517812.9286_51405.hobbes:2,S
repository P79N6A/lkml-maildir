Of course if you put /tmp in another disk this make sense.
But if you take it in the same disk but in a different partition,
supposing as you say that you'll genrated defective sectors in /tmp
because it's too much stressed compared to the rest of the disk, then you
could have all the machine blocked all the time rereading one sector for
half a minute maybe plus scsi aborts and so on.
The best is to distribute the load of the I/O all over the place IMHO. So
you can just look at the time the HD is supposed to run fine, and after
such time you replace the HD.
