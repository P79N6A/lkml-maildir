Can 2.0.36 (RedHat 5.2) support generic scsi devices?  Things like
scanners perhaps?
I added generic scsi support in the kernel (I think), and the system
stalls on boot trying to identify a scsi device it knows nothing about:(
In this particular instance I'm trying to get generic, user level support
for a Vela scsi attached mpeg-2 decoder.  The adaptec 2940uw sees it fine
but linux chokes on it.  If it helps, FreeBSD 2.2.7 sees it as /dev/uk0
(uk=UnKnown:)
Thanks in advance,
--- David
