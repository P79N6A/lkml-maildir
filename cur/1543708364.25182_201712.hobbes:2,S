Subject: how to switch from apm to acpi on 2.6?

I just switched from apm to acpi on 2.6.3, and found that I can't
"suspend" my notebook anymore.
I've got acpid running, and it's running correctly, but I don't have the
script to do the suspend. The sample program that came with acpid just
simply do a "shutdown".
With apmd, my machine suspends properly.
Any good scripts to suspend/resume?
Thanks,
Jeff
