It's more of a balance of freedom between licensee and licensee,
actually.  It's a lot about making sure no one can acquire a
privileged position, such that every licensee plays under the same
rules.  (The copyright holder is not *acquiring* a privileged
position, copyright law had already granted him/her that position.)
