AS is currently 10 seconds faster for that workload (untar of a kernel
and then applying 2237 patches). AS completes it in 155 seconds, CFQ
takes 164 seconds.
I still need to fix the streamed write perfomance regression, then I'll
see how the above compares again. CFQ doesn't do very well in eg
tiobench streamed write case (it's about 30% slower than AS).
(btw, any mention of CFQ in this thread refers to time sliced cfq).
