I update only infrequently because frankly git's remote branch tracking
is a mess. At least it doesn't really work for x86#mm here. 
I usually have to blow away the repository and reclone
to get back to a sane state.

Right now Jan's cpa change you merged makes the cpa selftest to not pass 
anymore on 32bit. While that was likely a latent bug it just
triggered it's a little inconvenient.
There's also the problem on NX handling still not being right.

There are still quite a lot outstanding. 
% wc -l patches/series 
90 patches/series
Some of that is debug or tbd or obsolete, but most isn't.

I would still think that the explicit barriers would make this 
all clearer, with long term giving cleaner semantics.
Admittedly I should have written some more comments in the
code.
I'm also a little unhappy on how many function calls the vgtod()
fast path contains now. Long ago it was a really lean function,
but it gets messed up more and more. Back when ->vread was introduced
the latency already suffered significantly (iirc multi digit
percent range), i suspect it now got worse again.
And after all that's still by far the most common system call
(not only for databases; i profiled this using systemtap in some
loads some time ago and it usually came up with >50%) 
and quite important for many workloads.
We have a lot far uglier code for less gain in far less critical calls.
