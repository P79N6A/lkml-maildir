We'd have to use up a struct page flag (PG_MIGRATED?) to mark
the page as migrated to keep the call to migrate_pages() for
the anonymous pages from migrating the pages again.  Then we'd
have to have some way to clear PG_MIGRATED once all of the
migrate_pages() calls are complete (we can't have the anonymous
page migrate_pages() calls clear the flags, since the second
such call would find the flag clear and remigrate the pages
in the overlapping nodes case.)
How about ignoring the va_start and va_end values unless
either:
       pid == current->pid
   or  current->euid == 0 /* we're root */
I like the first check a bit better than checking for 0.  Are
there other system calls that follow that convention (e. g.
pid = 0 implies current?)
The second check lets a sufficiently responsible task manipulate
other tasks.  This task can choose to have the target tasks
suspended before it starts fussing with them.

Yes,.that's been pointed out to me before.  Let's make it so.
