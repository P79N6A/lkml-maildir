Ok, I'm being pedantic. So shoot me.
There are a few tiny bits CodingStyle wise that could be better. No big deal,
I'm nitpicking in the extreme here...

Hmm, I believe the prefered style for functions is to indent parameters that
won't fit on the first line by two tab stops, like this : 
do_packet_read(char *data, struct list_head *ptemp_list,
		int length, int bytes_read, int *list_read_count)
There are several occourences of this.
