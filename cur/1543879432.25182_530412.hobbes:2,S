Actually this is the TOC-piece of .tex code around line 1622. The offending line
is way down (ca. 8152) at the actual chapter heading and it looks like this:
{\def\Element%
{0:451}\def\ProcessingMode%
{title-sosofo-mode}}\#if\endNode{}\def\HeadingText{%
10.7. \if}%
\endHeadPar{}\endSeq{}\Node%
and I think it is the fourth line that causes the problem for the # sign is
stripped and the title is converted to a tex conditional - \if - which isn't
terminated, but I'm not so sure. The thing is, the docbook2tex converts the
.tmpl file to .tex file ok but db2pdf chokes. What docbook-utils are you using?
Mine are version 0.6.14-1 of debian unstable.
By the way, were you going to send me some kernel-doc todo's...?
