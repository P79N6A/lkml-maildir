*If* you use APM on your server boxes. Not likely even when it doesn't have more than one CPU
and it can be checked at runtime.
I guess glibc could also regularly (every 10 calls or so) call regular gettimeofday
to recheck synchronization; at least for a web server that potential inaccuracy would
be acceptable ("best effort") and the cost of the system call is 1/10.
In x86-64 there are special vsyscalls btw to solve this problem that export
a lockless kernel gettimeofday()
