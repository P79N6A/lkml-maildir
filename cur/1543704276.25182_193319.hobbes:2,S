   The iommu code on zx1 boxes is currently limited to consistent
mappings of 64 * PAGE_SIZE.  We need to implement the consistent dma
mask interface so that 64bit devices can bypass the iommu and dma as
much as they'd like.  If you change your system page size to 64k, you
should be able to get up to 4MB mappings with the current code.  Sounds
like we need to do a BUG or something to make it more obvious how this
is failing.  It should be a pretty simple update to sba_iommu to make it
start looking at consistent_dma_mask in this path.  I'll try to get a
patch sent out for it on 2.6.  Thanks,
	Alex
