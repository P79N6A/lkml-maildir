FYI,
I ran the test case that Tarhon-Ohn had, but had to change his tc
execution from batch to single lines since the version of tc I have
segfaults on newlines.  Anyway, I did see the lock up with 2.6.11.2
after 7 iterations. I applied your patch, and it ran for 30 iterations
before I manually killed it. I didn't test any more than that, but this
seems to be the quick fix for now.
