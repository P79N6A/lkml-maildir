Even though the motherboard *should* perform the same regardless of the amount
of RAM, it may not.  Physically, the refresh needs higher current drive when
there are more modules.  I have seen a BIOS option to set the DRAM refresh
current (RAS, CAS settable to 10 or 16 mA each), but that was only on one
motherboard that I can remember - you might want to check for this.
