In a lot of ways that is reasonable.  However kernel threads don't
share signal handling and getting to the point where they could share
signal handling would be difficult so we cannot use the generic
CLONE_THREAD handling they really are more like individual processes.
So at that level the cpu number in the name is just to help tell them
apart.
