Ok the last -ac seems to have worked better than I had expected. I've
now got the test code with some more PCI cleanups. I need to finish
pushing these to the other drivers in the PCI layer and then I'll put
out another release
You can now do
hdparm -t /dev/hda           (get 900K/sec)
insmod piix
hdparm -d 1 /dev/hda
hdparm -t /dev/hda           (get 8Mbyte/sec)
[Yeah my TP600 drive isnt the fastest on earth]
