Dear all,
we would like to apologize for one of our customers who asked us for the
instalation of  this Autoresponder at our server hermes.hosting.cz
(194.213.32.216). He probably joined this conference and forgot to
deactivate the responding system.
We disconnected the responder manually as soon as we acknowledged this situation.
We are very sorry that this happened. Unfortunatelly, we can not avoid
such problems instead of our customer in such cases -- we were able just
to react in a case of the problem. Please accept our apology.
