Some silicons of Freescale processor are the same RapidIO controller,
such as mpc8540/mpc8560 are the same (v0.0), mpc8548/mpc8641 are the
same (v1.0). For v1.0 RapidIO controller, should we use mpc8548 or
mpc8641? Those will make people confused. Using IP Block Revision is a
clear choice.

Yes, RapidIO bus address width is 34 bits.

Do you misunderstand the meaning of 'interrupts'? These interrupts is
issued from the RapidIO controller to the pic controller for tx, rx,
err, doorbell and message.

These description is just for compatible="fsl,rapidio-v*.*" rapidio
controller.

The size is not used in this sector, so no defined.
Thanks!
