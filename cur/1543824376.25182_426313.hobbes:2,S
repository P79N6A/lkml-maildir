I doubt it.
Looks to me like your patch went into Linus's tree on March 24, 2006:
    changeset:   23661:1541c55e5f8d
    user:        Christoph Lameter <clameter@engr.sgi.com>

    summary:     [PATCH] cpusets: only wakeup kswapd for zones in the current cpuset
If that's so, then only a reversing patch will suffice.  Linus does not
remove patches from his tree; he only adds more patches.
