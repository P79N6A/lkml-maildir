You can create a Makefile to make only the modules you want.
All you need exists in a kernel tree that has (once) been configured
to build, at least, the modules that you want. It is trivial.
You have to remember to -DMODULE as well as -D__KERNEL__ as a
'C' compile parameter along with the other stuff on the command-line.
Understand that when somebody is designing a module, they just
build it in their own directory but, using -I on the command-line
make sure that the correct kernel headers are used (like
-I/usr/src/linux-2.4.20/include -I.).
So, a typical compile-command for a module would be to define the
correct includes and defines as CFLAGS, export those parameters, then
do make -C drivers/net 3x59x.o from inside your Makefile (to do the
3x59x.o module (it requires mii.o also).
