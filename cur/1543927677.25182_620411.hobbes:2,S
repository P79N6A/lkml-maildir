Hi Ian,
Personally I'm very appreciate your patches, they'll will
help submitting HP iPaqs SOCs/MFDs, you know... ;-)
Thus, much thanks in advance.
Few comments...

I'd resubmit cleaned up version. I think four or even more
resubmissions is inevitable for such patch-set (new general code +
a lot of drivers).
About patches their self... I think soc_add_devices could be
split into two small functions, thus you'll get rid of high
indentation level + code will be more reader friendly.
Ideally, checkpatch.pl should be happy. If it will, then there will
be less nitpicks somebody can pull. ;-)

Your patch has style problems, please review.  If any of these errors
are false positives report them to the maintainer, see
CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
- - - -
There is false positive though:
if (...) {
	single_stmt;
} else {
	one;
	two;
}
^^^ is perfectly OK and preferred, IIRC. checkpatch isn't ideal,
but it's mostly good.

Well, don't know about drivers/mfd/*. Probably there simply isn't
any [official] maintainer, thus lkml is the right place.
There is one not so obvious thing though: you should not submit patches
with To/Cc'ing lkml (open list) and linux-arm-kernel (subscribers-only).
Russell King will probably point to linux-arm-kernel etiquette article
(
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/mailinglists/etiquette.php
"Cross-posting between linux-arm* lists and other lists.")
So, either place linux-arm-kernel into Bcc:, or duplicate stuff for
lkml and linux-arm-kernel separately, thus they'll not see each
others' To/Cc.
Looking forward to your patches!
