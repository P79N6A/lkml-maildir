I've seen this happen when being careless about partitioning my drive.  If
you changed your partition table and created the filesystem without a reboot
you could be in for this problem.  If fdisk was unable to update the
partition table after writing it out and you ran mkreiserfs, you just made a
filesystem on the *old* partition, according to the *old* partition table.
Upon rebooting, the disk will be synced to the new partition table.  If you
happened to shrink the parition a bit, the filsystem is suddenly longer than
the partition.
