I think everything will break, unless we make 5.1 and 5.2 
into 4.2 and 4.3.  In the above design.

Quite likely.    The boot sector except for a handful of bytes actually
goes unused so we can put extra header information there, I actually
have patches for placing an ELF header there.
If we wanted to do an ELF header in the middle we would have to put
it at the end of the setup sectors rather then the beginning of the
raw protected mode kernel image.

Yes.  And this aspect of the relocatable kernel is all Vivek.
