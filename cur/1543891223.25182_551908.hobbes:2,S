Can you do 
for i in /sys/bus/pnp/devices/*; do if [ "$(cat $i/id)" = PNP0b00 ]; 
then cat $i/resources; echo options; cat $i/options; fi; done
and provide the output? It sounds like you have the same problem I do, 
that is that you have no IRQ listed in the PNP table.
Though, actually, on reading the code:
The code for checking for a platform device only gets included if 
CONFIG_PNP isn't set! David, surely this should be a runtime thing 
rather than a compile-time one? Right now building a kernel with PNP 
support will break horribly if it's then run on a non-PNP system...
