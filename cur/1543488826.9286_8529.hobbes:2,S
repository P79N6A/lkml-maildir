Subject: Offtopic: help me set up a CVS repository for kernel

For my own personal use, I want to set up a CVS repository of the kernel,
so I can feel more comfortable hacking around.  I would like to begin by
importing all of the history I have in patch files, which dates back to
2.1.115.  Here are my problems:
1) cvsignore.  I haven't built a kernel yet inside a cvs repository.  Can
someone tell me in advance what all the right ignores are? (i.e. I *do*
want linux/net/core but not all the depend and symbol verioning files).
2) keyword substitution.  Since the source comes from other peoples
RCS/CVS systems, the source often already contains keywords.  Do I use
'-ko' at all times?
3) patching.  When I apply a Linus patch to my main branch (or the 'Linus'
branch, I haven't decided exactly yet) and 100 new files are added and 100
files are removed, is there an automated way to get this info into CVS
properly?
4) ... I don't even know yet, but I'll bet you all do.  What else am I
missing?
I don't *need* to do this all myself, if someone can tarball a repository
that has the main branch in it, with the proper sticky file options and
.cvsignore files, that would be OK, but doing it myself is good too.
Thanks in advance,
David
