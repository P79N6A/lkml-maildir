I think it's very useful information to have.  For a start, it tells
you who has the hardware and knows how to build a kernel.  So if you're
making a change to a driver and want it tested, you can troll the file's
changelog looking for people who might be able to help.
A similar argument would apply to Reported-by:, which we possibly also
need.  But it's all perhaps a bit much for poor kernel developers to
keep track of ;)
