Yeah, I'm only aware of 3:
  - the BAR overlapping w/MMCONFIG problem described above
  - ATI chipset config space retry bug
  - VIA (?) chipset host bridges don't respond well to having decode
    disabled (they stop decoding RAM addresses as well)
That's it afaik, so I've never really known where Linus' paranoia comes 
from.  OTOH I haven't been too keen to challenge it either; MMCONFIG 
space is only just beginning to be tested widely with the deployment of 
Vista, so we'll doubtless see more problems on older chipsets if we 
enable it by default.
