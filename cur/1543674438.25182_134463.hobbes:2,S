Well I spent a few hours running this on the quad xeon (aic7xxx).
There were no hangs, and there was no appreciable performance difference
between 2.5.69, 2.6.69-mm7++ with AS and 2.5.69-mm7++ with deadline.
Please confirm that the hang only happened with the anticipatory scheduler?
It could require a particular device driver to reproduce.  Please see if
you can generate that sysrq-T output.  Also if you can try a different
device driver sometime that would be interesting.  There seem to be several
alternate ISP drivers around - the feral driver perhaps, and the new one in
the linux-scsi tree.
