You can make SILO 64-bit, but it would just be a lot
of work and would just result in a SILO that, unlike
current SILO, would only work on UltraSPARC machines.
32-bit SILO, on the other hand, can work on any Sparc system.
There really is no advantage, and known disadvantages, to
making SILO 64-bit.
