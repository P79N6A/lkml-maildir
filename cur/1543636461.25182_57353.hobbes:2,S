Hi,
Yes I use smbfs.
Regarding my oops report, is there known
bug where waitqueue would be corrupted ? When I analyzed
it I found that invalid address 8bd4189c was loaded from
tasklist pointer in wait_queue_head_t (sched.c, __wake_up_common
line "p = curr->task").
The wakeup was called from get_new_inode and seems like
if list of tasks was not initialized of what :(
thanks, devik
