Glad all this discussion helped at least one of us:-))
As for me, as I already mentioned in my last posting - I don't know why BIOS makes the difference (as in your case) if ide.txt says it shouldn't?! Ok, chipset, perhaps, is fine. But what about the hard drive? You told you had WDC AC21600H. Can you PLEASE check waht CCC is marked on its label? PLEASE! I am trying to get an answer from WD on this, but not yet alas...
And - COME ON, GUYS! - somebody MUST know the answer - how to spot the guilty one - kernel configuration / BIOS / chipset / disk???
