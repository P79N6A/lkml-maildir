Whenever a configuration change adds a new kernel symbol to the list
of versioned symbols, a "make dep" run is necessary to update the
symbol versions in include/linux/modules. If the symbol was previously
not used, your first "make dep" had missed it and thus generated no
version.
Conclusion: "make dep" after each config change is necessary and
(should be) sufficient. If not,
rm -rf include/linux/modules include/linux/modversions.h ; make dep
