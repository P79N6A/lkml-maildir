Not only that, I think the judge would have something to say about the 
fact that the modules interface is delibrately changed all the time 
with stated intent of breaking binary drivers.  In fact, Linus pointed
out his thoughts on what the judge would say:
    In fact, I will bet you that if the judge thinks that you tried to
    use technicalities ("your honour, I didn't actually run the 'ln'
    program, instead of wrote a shell script for the _user_ to run the
    'ln' program for me"), that judge will just see that as admission
    of the fact that you _knew_ you were doing something bad.
Why is it that the judge wouldn't see the delibrate changing of the
interfaces, the EXPORT_GPL stuff, all of that as a way to delibrately
force something that wouldn't otherwise be a derived work into a 
derived work category?
