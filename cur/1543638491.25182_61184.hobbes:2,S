The Rice people avoided some of the fragmentation problems by
pro-actively allocating a max-order physical page, even when only a
(small) virtual page was being mapped.  This should work very well as
long as the total memory usage (including memory lost due to internal
fragmentation of max-order physical pages) doesn't exceed available
memory.  That's not a condition which will hold for every system in
the world, but I suspect it is true for lots of systems for large
periods of time.  And since superpages quickly become
counter-productive in tight-memory situations anyhow, this seems like
a very reasonable approach.
