What is this gid mail crap ? You don't need priviledge. You get the mail by
asking the daemon for it. procmail needs no priviledge either if it is done
right.
You just need to think about the security models in the right way. Linux gives
you the ability to do authenticated uid/gid checking over a socket connection.
That is an incredibly powerful model for real compartmentalisation.
