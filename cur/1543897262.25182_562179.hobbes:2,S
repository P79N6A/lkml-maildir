This should probably just check for the individual flags it can support
(e.g. no FA_FL_DEALLOC, no FA_FL_DEL_DATA).
I also thought another proposed flag was to determine whether mtime (and
maybe ctime) is changed when doing prealloc/dealloc space?  Default should
probably be to change mtime/ctime, and have FA_FL_NO_MTIME.  Someone else
should decide if we want to allow changing the file w/o changing ctime, if
that is required even though the file is not visibly changing.  Maybe the
ctime update should be implicit if the size or mtime are changing?
Cheers, Andreas
