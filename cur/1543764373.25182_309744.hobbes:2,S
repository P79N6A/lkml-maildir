What should disabling C_A_D do?

What program is that?  I'm just echoing 0 | 1 into
/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del , is that equivalent?
or have you tried that?

echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del
  is same as CAD_OFF
echo 1
  is same as CAD_ON
I tested 2.4.28, 2.6.3, 2.6.9, 2.6.11, and all of them behaved
the same way for me.  If it's an issue with using a syscall
to change the setting, I'll be glad to look into that too.
observed behaviors:
CAD enabled + C_A_D keys => call machine_reboot()
  to reboot quickly, no normal shutdown sequence;
CAD disabled + C_A_D keys => kill init, go thru normal
  clean shutdown sequence;
are these the expected behaviors?
