You won't see this error with gcc < 3.4 .
The kernel redefines "inline" to __attribute__((always_inline)).
That's why gcc 3.4 (correctly) aborts the compilation if it can't inline 
it.
gcc 3.4 isn't able to inline a function that wasn't defined before the 
first usage with -fno-unit-at-a-time (and we are currently giving this 
flag on i386).
That's the reason why a function prototype for a "static inline" 
function doesn't help you.
I can send you my .config if these explanations weren't enough.
