Andrew,
Thank you very much!  That appears to have been it.
I think it may have crept into my config way back when
when I enabled kernel debugging so I could get the
Alt-SysRq stuff enabled.  I didn't realize I had enabled
other things to be turned on as well.  This certainly
taught me to take a closer look at my config when
changing it.  Thanks again.
My system is much more speedy at compiles now!
