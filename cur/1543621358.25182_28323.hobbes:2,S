I just wanted to throw in my 0.02 Euro on this one:
I have not yet tested your patch yet - but this functionality is *very*
important to my company as well.
Anyone developing applications with multiple processes will benefit
significantly from having core files named differnetly than just "core".
A patch was included in the kernel some time ago, to allow the appending of the
PID - however, this is not really good enough. It's better than nothing, but
it's not good.
What I want is "core.[process name]" eventually with a ".[pid]" appended.  A
flexible scheme like your patch implements is very nice.   Actually having
the core files in CWD is fine for me - I mainly care about the file name.
Furthermore, the patch that went in earlier is *horrible* code. Let me give a
few examples:
...
        char corename[6+sizeof(current->comm)+10];
...
        memcpy(corename,"core.", 5);
        corename[4] = '\0';
...
        if (core_uses_pid || atomic_read(&current->mm->mm_users) != 1)
                sprintf(&corename[4], ".%d", current->pid);
Enough said.
