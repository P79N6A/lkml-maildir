When I start top and press down the space bar (starting keypress repeat),
then this top process sucks up ALL CPU POWEER of my p-ii 333, and STILL is
unable to cope with ~30 refreshes per second.
Incidentally, top only uses sycalls to access this information it requires
(namely open/read/close ;) IT's just that it needs _hundresds_ or even
_thousands_ of syscalls.
And top is a program that is used very often.
Now, I expect only a moderate performance improvement from /proc to using
sysctl, but nevertheless, a /proc-based sysctl would be the worst of both
worlds: binary format, dog-slow.

Definitely.
