Subject: [PATCH] i386: flush_cpumask doesn't need "or"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/31/55

Did I miss something or do we needlessly do an "or" to flush_cpumask
while we could just assign it ? We never exit that function with the
mask not empty and we have a spinlock...
