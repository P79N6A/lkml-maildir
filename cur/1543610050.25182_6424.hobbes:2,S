Hi,
I'm on holiday this week, so apologies in advance if my replies are not
as prompt as they would otherwise be....
Which kernel version are you using ? What are your settings in the
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_*mem files or did you just use the default
values ? Did you run the nbd server on the same machine as the client ?
How much memory do you have in the machine that you are testing with ?
Its a little while since I looked at nbd in detail, so if you can send me
enough info to reproduce your set up, then I'll try and have a go in the
next few days,
Steve.
