You are on the right track. The problem is not the shared libraries
themselves, but where they end up. mmap() allocated memory from 0x40000000
and grows upward by default. This is the problem. I changed this so that
it now allocates from 0x80000000 and upwards. So now I have a 2GB heap
instead of a 1GB heap.
This was accomplished by changing the TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE to some larger
figure in include/asm/processor.h (TASK_SIZE-1G for example)
I chose a 2GB heap and a 1GB mmap area instead of 1/2GB. This works alot
better for me, since the programs I have usually do malloc() and not
mmap().
