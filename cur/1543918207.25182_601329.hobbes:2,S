That you know about...
The value of SELinux (or indeed any system compartmentalising access and
limiting damage) comes into play when you get breakage - eg via a web
browser exploit.
Yes SELinux is much more relevant to servers, and really comes into its
own when its used to write custom rulesets and enforce corporate policy
("No you can't run that screensaver that arrived by email").
