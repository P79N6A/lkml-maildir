Hi,
I noticed a regression, visible in the drivers/usb/gadget Kconfig;
it seems to be quite recent.
That Kconfig hasn't changed (other than adding new drivers), and
it's worked that way for several years now ... so the issue seems
to be changes in menuconfig/kconfig/etc semantics.
The issue is that when USB_GADGET=m, it's no longer possible to
configure peripheral controller drivers as modules ... the controller
drivers can now only be configured for static linkage.
It should be making a choice of one of the controller drivers which
could work on the target system, and allow that driver to be linked
either as a module (ok iff USB_GADGET=m) or statically.
What's the deal here?
