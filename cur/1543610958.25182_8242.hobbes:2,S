Ben, you remember the patch I sent to you a few weeks
ago ?
VLAN didn't link builtin on alpha because
vlan_proc_cleanup()
in section __exit was called from vlan_proc_init() in
section
__init, and it semt that the absolute offsets between
these
two functions were too big for the linker to put it on
a 16 bit
value (which was the space reserved for a relative
call, it 
seems). So the linker complained and stopped. I had to
extract
the cleanup from __exit and put it into another
function which
worked.
Regards,
Willy
