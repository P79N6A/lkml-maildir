I downloaded the different csets and compiled them. However,before 
that was finished and I could test them Trond posted some patch on the 
mailing list that fixed my OOPS.(my OOPS was nfsroot related)  
Anyway thanx for the csets and the quick respons ,next time I got a Oops I 
know where to look for the csets. The next bug is mine to hunt :)
