I am working in 
2.4.20-8 kernel.
To fill the keyboard buffer  with characters from user space, I used 
TIOCSTI
ioctls. Is there a similar method so I can send raw keyboard codes into
the scancode buffer? 
ioctls("/dev/tty0",TIOCSTI,&c);
    it worked in Console.
ioctls("/dev/tty7",TIOCSTI,&c);
   is not working in x-windows. Here c is a character.
Can you guide me in this regard.
  ThanksInAdvance,
   P.Manohar,
