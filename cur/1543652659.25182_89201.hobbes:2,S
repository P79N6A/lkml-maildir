Sure do - one controller is the integrated VIA KT133, the second is an
on-board Promise PDC20265.  The Maxtor drive is on the VIA, IBM on
Promise.
It must've been running smartctl on the IBM drive that would bonk my
system - I just tried 'cat /proc/ide/hde/identity' and my machine froze
solid - no numlock, no sysrq, no ping.  The disk access light was on.
I hadn't even considered the different controllers.
