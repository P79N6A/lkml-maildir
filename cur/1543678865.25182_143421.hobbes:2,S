I think you are saying that its not a module. Here is another report of 
a similar problem to mine:
http://www.music.columbia.edu/pipermail/linux-audio-user/2003-June/005119.html
He eventually solved the problem by making sure the ssci support wasnt 
built as modules. (Follow the thread above).
There definitely seems to be a problem. If its not a problem but rather 
a feature then I would like to know more about why we need to compile it 
into the kernel...(i.e. what do we gain )..
