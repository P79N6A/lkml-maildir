All i'd like to ask is WHY!?
WHY such a big open heart surgery?
OK, you have your reasons.
> Could you test patches for us? first thing would be to enable debug output patch below.
The machine is still production. It will be replaced by a 64bit system 
with an AACRAID card some time in the future. Then, i could maybe test 
patches on the old machine. But unfortunatly, it's not my machine. It's 
just administrated by me. And i don't know, what's exactly is the future 
of it.

I see. Thanks for the hint. Would be an alternative. Actually, i don't 
need 2.6.24 - but if something security related is fixed, then i'm not 
able to move on to 2.6.24. And i'm using Gentoo. There's not really a 
kernel maintained by the distribution.

I don't think, it's a seperate card, that i could send you. It's some 
19" rack server with such a card on-board, i think.
So it don't see much opportunity for me to test patched and stuff :-(
