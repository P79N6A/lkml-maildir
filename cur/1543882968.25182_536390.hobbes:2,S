Thanks for tossing it out ;-) I understand your uncertainty and I share your
opinion about encouraging industry developers to GPL their drivers. It really
took me some time until I understood that sometimes there are _good_ reasons
for a closed driver. UIO is not intended for mass products like graphic cards.
We're talking about companies who developed special hardware for use in
special applications like machine control. They sometimes need to keep a 
part of their driver closed, at least for some time. Sometimes it's because
they want to protect themselves, sometimes because their customer demands it.
Usually, they know about the disadvantages you mentioned (if they're our
customers, be sure we tell them!).
Anyway, UIO is not just a system to allow closed drivers. There are enough
other reasons why these industry developers want userspace drivers. The most
important one is that they're usually no experienced kernel developers. They
can let somebody write the kernel part for them, and then write their driver
using the tools and libraries they know, with floating point and all that 
stuff. It's just convenient. If I had to write a driver for a fieldbus card
today, I'd use UIO. And I'd make it free software. UIO doesn't force anybody 
to close his drivers.

This is quite a large kernel module for an UIO device due to quite 
stupid hardware design. It needs two memory mappings, and the interrupt
handler is not the simplest thing possible. BTW, I don't think that
156 lines is so much. It allows to handle quite a complex PCI card. And
it's so simple that it can be even explained to industry programmers
who are no kernel gurus.
Thanks,
Hans
