Well, the data is part of the inode and not the file as well.  So why
are read/write special?
OK, I realize now, that with special files (device, fifo) the I/O is
actually on the open file and _not_ on the inode.  So the above is
only true for regular files.
And so it really would make sense to make a separate fgetattr() file
operation, so we only get it for regular files and not for special
files.  Because for the specail file case it really doesn't make sense
to pass the file pointer to the filesystem, since the filesystem knows
nothing about the open file.
