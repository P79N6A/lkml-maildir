for i386, bt_ioremap is using fixmap, and it is temporary boot-time
mappings, used before ioremap() is functional.
but we need one as permanent fixed address.
for x86_64, early_ioremap. I'd like to make to static, because
dmi_ioremap could use ioremap instead.
Fix address could make the earlycon can be used more earlier.
