Hi.
Im having some problems that appear ppp related.
Im using synce to connect to my WinCE handheld. with 2.5.70 this works great using the ipaq driver (modified to recognise the toshiba e750 USB id).
the ipaq driver and USBserial stuff seem to be the same in 2.6.0-test1 but the ppp stuff is quite different.
Does anyone know if the ppp stuff is significantly altered?
the problem seems to be that synce can make a connection but that data does not flow. on 2.5.70 all is fine and the connection can be made and authenticated.
