Hi,
Ben finally found out the cause of Oops happening on ALSA OSS
emulation with powermac driver.  It's because of the sign of char.
The patch is simple as attached below.
Could you apply it to 2.6.10?
thanks,

Summary: [ALSA] Fix Oops with ALSA OSS emulation on PPC
Fix suggested by Benjamin Herrenschmidt <benh@kernel.crashing.org>
On architectures like PPC, char is handled as "unsigned char", thus the
pcm_format_data table entries with -1 give a positive 255.  This results
in Oops with OSS-emulation on such architectures.
The patch simply adds the right signed/unsigned prefix to fix this problem.
