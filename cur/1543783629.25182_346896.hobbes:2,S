On a happier note, once the infrastructure is accepted, anyone with a
hotswap-unsupported controller and some time on their hands will
easily be able to integrate hotswap in; that is the whole goal of an
infrastructure.  So if your controller isn't supported, but you know
something about it (or better yet, you yourself have docs), adding
hotswap support to it should be too hard.
