Hello Andrew, community,
I am not really aware how your -mm tree cooperates with git so I have 
questions.
Actually I am talking about the "git-ubi.patch" in your tree. You seems 
to periodically update the patch by fetching the stuff from the 
ubi-2.6.git GIT tree.
1. How do you produce the diff file from the ubi-2.6.git?
2. Do you mind if I re-base the ubi-2.6.git from time to time? Does it 
cause any troubles for you?
3, Are there some special things I should or should not do to make it 
easy for you to work with the git tree?
4. I see a 
"ubi-versus-add-include-linux-freezerh-and-move-definitions-from.patch" 
patch in your tree. It is related to the stuff which is available in 
Linus's tree. But my tree does not have it yet. Is is OK if I won't push 
it for now and do this later when I sync with mainline?
Thanks.
