Hi all,
I have tested the El Torito INT 0x13 func 0x4B to get the "current booting
device", and it seems very unreliable across BIOS vendors. I doubt it can be
useful.
Another way may be this: The included patch makes the kernel try to mount a
iso9660 root file system from the ide devices hda, hdb, hdc and hdd. You can
then make a bootable cdrom from a lilo/syslin diskette and a "full" root
file system on the cdrom, maybe with the Joliet extention.
Cheers,
Peter
