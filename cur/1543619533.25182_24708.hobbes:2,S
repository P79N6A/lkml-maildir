I use GRE tunnels a lot.  I have run my rc.networking script several 
dozen times with no problems and everything is cranking along nicely. 
 You can view my scripts at 
http://blue-labs.org/.
  I always use a 
single numbered interface, "gre1".
However the below really is a bug that should be fixed I would imagine.
