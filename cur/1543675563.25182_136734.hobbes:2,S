Probably the simplest solution is to make the said tool recognise
a line like...
	#pragma KandR
...and have it abort any file where it finds that line with some
sort of warning, perhaps along the lines of...
	SanityCheck: Found K&R pragma, ignoring kernel/foobar.c
...or something similar. It would then be simply a case of adding
the said line near the top of whichever source files are still in
K&R format.
Best wishes from Riley.
