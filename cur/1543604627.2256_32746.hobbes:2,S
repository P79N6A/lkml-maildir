(a) is simple, but needs a 1KB malloc (or alternately, a 1KB static const
array - I've taken the approach that the malloc is better)
(b) isn't that much harder, but requires drivers to be sure to call
init_crc32 and cleanup_crc32.  If somehow they manage not to do that, Oops.
I don't want to add a runtime check for the existance of the array in
crc32().
