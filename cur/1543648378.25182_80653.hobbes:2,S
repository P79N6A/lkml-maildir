People should note that the reason this hasn't been addressed to date is
that the disk is so many orders of magnitude slower than CPU that the
practical effect of the "bottleneck" is below the noise with most
hardware.
So you're not wrong, but you seem to be making it more of an issue than
the actual impact seems to justify. I bet you can measure it, or even
config a system where it matters, but in most cases it doesn't.
