OK, this I don't have any problem with.
I'm not yet fully convinced that __HAVE_ARCH_xxx is really that bad, but 
your proposed solution doesn't have the problems I had in mind.
What is OK:
  obj-$(CONFIG_GENERIC_FOO) += generic-foo.o
What is not OK:
  lib-y += generic-foo.o
The latter has the following disadvantages:
- it's non-obvious whether the object actually gets included in the 
  kernel
- if the contents of generic-foo.o is only used in modules, 
  generic-foo.o is _not_ included in the kernel resulting in an
  obvious breakage
