Actually, these aren't technically run time checks.  Although the cpp
can't be used for sizeof(), the compiler (at least gcc) does seem to
have enough sense to optimise away if(..) branches it has enough
information to know won't be taken at compile time.
As long as this optimisation works, I think the if(sizeof(..)) checks
are fine for this.
