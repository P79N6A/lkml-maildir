Please, do the above such a way that we can have an arch hook for the
bus speed. It's actually not uncommon to have several busses with
different speeds in a machine. In addition, I've seen IDE drivers
calculating based on the bus speed while the HW apparently used a clock
source that didn't necessarily had to be ... PciClk ... Oh well...

Why do we need the above at all ? It always looked to me like a gross
hack but then, I don't fully understand what the problem was on those
old x86 that needed it :)
