Hmmm, it seems most of these apply to mobile processors.
I'm using AMD 1.4 Athlon Thunderbird on a desktop, as you know my
processor was the one before release low power AMD XP processors.
It uses a savage amount of power, and operates well into 60 and 70
degrees celcius.
I'm not a big linux head, can someone through me an ACPI link, related
to this issue of CPU C state?
One other thing, apart from saving power on CPU and hard-disk (via
hdparm) is there anything else I can look into ? something worthy
though.
Thanks,
Seamus
