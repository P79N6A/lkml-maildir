           Summary: performance regression compared to 2.4.20 under tight
                    RAM conditions
    Kernel Version: 2.5.73
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: akpm@digeo.com
         Submitter: idan@idanso.dyndns.org
Distribution:
debian unstable
Hardware Environment:
Pentium III 700Mhz
I815E Based motherboard
64MB SDRAM 133
WD 6GB harddrive, UDMA2
Software Environment:
GCC 3.3-2
glibc 2.3.1-16
Swap partition 123MB
Swap file(on ext3 fs) of about 96MB
Problem Description:
For quite a time I had the feeling that the 2.5.x kernels perform worse than
2.4.x on my box, especially when having to do aggrassive swapping(Switching
between relatively heavyweight(ram wise) applications)
I considered this feeling subjective at first, however, eventually I took the
time to write some benchmarking code and compare results.
The code(attached) is pretty trivial, it forks, mallocs and initialize a very
large bulk of memory(I used total RAM*1.5), in order to force the system to
swap, and simulate two processes fighting on RAM space when there is no enough
of that scared resource:-)
After both processes end their work, the parent process reports on the total
running time.
The code was compiled using gcc 3.3 with -O2 parameter.
I've done 20 iterations on each of the three kernels:
Stock debian 2.4.20 (kernel-source-2.4.20-5)
Stock vanilla 2.5.73 with preempt
Stock vanilla 2.5.73 without preempt
Result are at follows:
2.4.20            : Mean - 14.1732 Max - 16.0875 Min - 12.9977 
2.5.73            : Mean - 17.1692 Max - 21.8161 Min - 15.4827
2.5.73(w/o prempt): Mean - 16.9054 Max - 19.0174 Min - 15.4137
As can be seen, the differences are quite significant, about three seconds on
average, which I believe may be related to the increased swapping time I have
encountered.
