It's funny you should post this, I just encountered the
same thing a few days ago, and found the cause a few
minutes ago.
The problem is that 2.6.x restricts unpinned mmaps (mmaps
where the app does not supply the virtual address) to the
400000000-c000000000 range, while redhat allows all holes
in the user address space to satisfy such requests.
RedHat implements this by introducing an i386-specific
version of arch_get_unmapped_area().  This has not
yet made it to the official kernels.  I have no idea
if it was ever submitted for consideration, or was
submitted and rejected.
Regards,
Joe
