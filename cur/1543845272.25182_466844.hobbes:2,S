memtest86 and/or memtest86+ are usually good starting points :
http://www.memtest86.com/
http://www.memtest.org/
faulty memory can often lead to very strange and seemingly random
problems, so give the machine a good run with a mem testing tool like
one of the above - I'd suggest running all tests of memtest86+ for
some 8-12 hours - if the machine survives that without errors then
your RAM is probably OK.
If you suspect your CPU (or just want to make sure) then a program
like cpuburn can be useful :

If you suspect your harddrive, then smartmontools is probably what you
are looking for:
