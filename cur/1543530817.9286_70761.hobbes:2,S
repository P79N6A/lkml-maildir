I'll say it again too :P
The OOPSes happen either modular or in core.  Hard lockup happens with either
modular or in core.  And FWIW, the previous tulip_cb was only available as a
module.
I'm gearing up to test all my pcmcia cards again with the most recent
2.3.99-pre2-5 and shm patch.  I've been on the road all week and the weekend
is mine...what's left of it.
