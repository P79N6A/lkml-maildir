So, I understand you are saying that the Linux kernel works fine
and your tools fail. That may be. But then why post to linux-kernel?
By default all is well. You might check stty (cs8 bit), or the
eightBitInput/eightBitOutput resources for xterm, or the settings
for your shell or whatever settings are relevant for the environment
where you are trying to do your stuff. Some versions of flex require
the -8 flag. telnet might require a -8 flag. Etc. There is a HOWTO.
