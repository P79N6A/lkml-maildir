Folks, let's look at it that way:
	* warnings are tools to locate broken places in the tree.
	* we have two signals ("is unused" and "may be unused"), say
A(location, verision) and B(location, version).
	* A has fairly high S/N ratio.
	* B has very large noise component, but it's only weakly dependent
on the verision.
The question is how to get useful information out of those.
	* solution 1: introduce C(location, version) and filter A and B
with it, to kill noise in B.
	* solution 2: ignore B, either by gcc modification or simply filtering
it with grep.
	* solution 3: subtract the signals for consequent versions.
IMO it's obvious that combining outputs of (2) and (3) gives the best S/N.
The reason why (1) is bad is that it kills high-S/N channel in the areas
with high noise on low-S/N channel *and* that filtered-out areas will
remain filtered out in the next versions.  IOW, it's a clear loss.
