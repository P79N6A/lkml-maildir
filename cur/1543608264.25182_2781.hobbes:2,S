Hey folks,
One of the workstations I use really doesn't like the emu10k driver in 
2.4.13-ac5.  The box is a dual athlon running rh7.2.  Playing mp3s seems 
to work well, but other samples from xfce on shutdown and window close 
result in buzzing and popping noises.  If anyone wants details or patches 
tested, drop me a note.
