Gadi,
I looked at what you did with ide-floppy and repeated with 
/*
 *      Some tape drives require a long irq timeout
 */
#if 0
#define IDETAPE_WAIT_CMD                60
#else
#define IDETAPE_WAIT_CMD                (5 * WAIT_CMD)
#endif
and I have two tapes under SMP streaming, opps, maybe one now.
What is the preferred wait timeout?
