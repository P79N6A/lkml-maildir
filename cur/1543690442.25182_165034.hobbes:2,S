Sorry, for the delay.  I captured console output from failed (normal
acpi) boot.  I also re-ran on 2.6.0-test5 and captured those outputs.
The test3-bk3 is actually test3-bk2+acpi_>15_irq.patch which is the
patch that began the breakage for me.
http://developer.osdl.org/chrisw/acpi/2.6.0-test3-bk3/
http://developer.osdl.org/chrisw/acpi/2.6.0-test5/
Each have dmesg and interrupts from pci=noacpi and acpi=off, dmesg with
acpi enabled, disassembled dsdt, and dmidecode.
Let me know if you need any more info.
thanks,
