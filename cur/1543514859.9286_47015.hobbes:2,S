Because you can remove it from the system without using a screwdriver
:-).  This counts as a major plus for some of us.  Plus, it's
*trivial* to connect an ATA flash card reader to a mass-market
motherboard and then throw PCMCIA or CF flash cards into it.  It ends
up costing ~$150 for 8MB of bootable, removable flash this way, and
you can scale up to 400+ MB of flash, if you need it.
