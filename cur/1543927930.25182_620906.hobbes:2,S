Very strange indeed. Another possibility is that there is a hardware
monitoring chip connected to one of the Radeon adapter's I2C buses, and
that holding the I2C lines prevents reading from it, so whatever is
responsible for controlling the temperature prefers to play it safe and
shuts everything down. Somehow it seems more realistic than an actual
overheating (3 seconds is a very short period of time for that), but
we'd need the exact schematics of the hardware, and the details of the
thermal control system, to validate this theory.
Anyway, no need to worry anymore now that the bug is fixed :)
