Interesting, that about extended partitions. Anyway, I need them, cos I
got DOS, linux and netbsd on my disk, and I can't squeeze all of them into
the four primary partitions.
Are you saying that though fdisk says /dev/hda5 starts at the same cylinder
as my original /dev/hda6 started, it might actually be different at the
sector level? (my disk is LBA, of course)
