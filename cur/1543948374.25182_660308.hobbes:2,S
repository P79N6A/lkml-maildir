Things are changing, with memory hot-add remove, CPU hotplug , the topology can
change and is no longer static. One can create fake NUMA nodes on the fly using
a boot option as well.
Since we're talking of parallel reclaims, I think it's a function of CPUs and
Nodes. I'd rather keep it as a sysctl with a good default value based on the
topology. If we end up getting it wrong, the system administrator has a choice.
That is better than expecting him/her to recompile the kernel and boot that. A
sysctl does not create problems either w.r.t changing the number of threads, no
hard to solve race-conditions - it is fairly straight forward
