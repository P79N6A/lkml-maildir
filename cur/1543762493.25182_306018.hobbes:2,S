It will just completely stop network dataflow.
It is of course not as catastrophic as removing strong random numbers 
from system.
But nevertheless - write cahce in disks may corrupt data on power-down,
but people do not turn it off, crypto HW can be broken and does not 
encrypt dataflow, but people want it, broken NIC can corrupt data with 
various sg/offload combinations, but it can be enabled.
It is a feature, that _may_ broke thing badly.
But if all is ok - it is extremly usefull.
And as I said there may be other [HW/driver] validating techniques, 
not only userspace daemon.

Userspace daemon can read data from /dev/random and validate it
in background, if it fells it is broken - turn feature off.
