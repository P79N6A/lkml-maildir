Well, it was quick enough to just do - here's the patch.  I've
also updated the documentation a bit to clarify the intention and
the reasons why you might want to use it (based in part on the 
comments to the original change that made highmem uncountable for
dirtyness purposes)
Tested and applied against 2.6.23.9 (our build script makes Debian
packages from a clean unpack of kernel major plus patch minor plus
svn checkout of out quilt series and apply regardless, so it was
just as easy to bump the version number while I was at it).
Builds, boots, passes a quick run of the test program I used last
time around.

Add vm.highmem_is_dirtyable toggle
A 32 bit machine with HIGHMEM64 enabled running DCC has an MMAPed file
of approximately 2Gb size which contains a hash format that is written
randomly by the dbclean process.  On 2.6.16 this process took a few
minutes.  With lowmem only accounting of dirty ratios, this takes about
12 hours of 100% disk IO, all random writes.
This patch includes some code cleanup from Linus and a toggle in
/proc/sys/vm/highmem_is_dirtyable which can be set to 1 to add the 
highmem back to the total available memory count.
