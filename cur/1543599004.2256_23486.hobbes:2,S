Hi!
Is this transfer of lkml to vger.kernel.org a final thing, or is it
just temporary till rutgers is up again?
Also, are there any plans of moving the list to majordomo2? There are
certain features of majordomo2 that makes it easier to live with a
list. I mean "set linux-kernel nomail" kinda thing.
