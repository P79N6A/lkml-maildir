I see that idle() is called much less often than before (1000
calls/second down to 150 calls/second, estimated and non-scientifical).
non-linear scale down is most probably because processes get more done
and don't wait so much.
idle() is also get called more when there is some load.
There is something weird though, I have this constant 0.8 load which I
can't pinpoint, in -mm4 fully idle machine was at about 0.1 load.
Regarding my stupidly reported Xfree86 -problem, it was PEBKAC, though I
can't tell what exactly that was. Only one module changed way to iterate
pci_find_device between boots.
