A cursory examination show that the two aren't even remotely
similar in a lot of cases.  Take the misc filesystems section
for example.. (edited for brevity)
2.4
# Miscellaneous filesystems
#
# CONFIG_ADFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_AFFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_HFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_HFSPLUS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_BEFS_FS is not set
# CONFIG_BFS_FS is not set
CONFIG_EFS_FS=m
CONFIG_HPFS_FS=m
CONFIG_SYSV_FS=m
CONFIG_UFS_FS=m
2.6
# Miscellaneous filesystems
#
CONFIG_AFFS_FS=m
CONFIG_HFS_FS=m
CONFIG_HFSPLUS_FS=m
CONFIG_BEFS_FS=m
CONFIG_BFS_FS=m
CONFIG_EFS_FS=m
CONFIG_JFFS2_FS=m
CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_NAND=y
CONFIG_JFFS2_ZLIB=y
CONFIG_JFFS2_RTIME=y
CONFIG_CRAMFS=m
CONFIG_VXFS_FS=m
CONFIG_QNX4FS_FS=m
CONFIG_SYSV_FS=m
CONFIG_UFS_FS=m
And you wonder why 2.6 is taking longer ?
There are many more cases like this in your configs..
Unless you're comparing apples to apples, this is
just nonsense.
