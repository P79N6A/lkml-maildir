Yes - this method was rejected by James, so I had to change away from
using the genhd to transmit events.

Is it possible to use the linkage that is in the scsi_device directory
of the disk that is sending the event to find the relevant block devices?
For example, /sys/class/scsi_device/0:0:0:0/device/block:sda
on my system tells me which block devices belong to this device.
