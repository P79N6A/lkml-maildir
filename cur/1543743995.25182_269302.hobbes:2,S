	Thank you for your reply.
	If I dereference the address in 1022 (the ring 3 ESP address) it
does indeed return the value in EBX. I then thought that I could use
this address to feed to dump_thread() since EBX is the first thing in
the pt_regs structure, but that's not correct in this case because the
other registers are definitely incorrect. Shouldn't the ESP value
pointed to by KSTK_ESP() point to the beginning of the pt_regs structure
for the user space application?
