I guess they're just real busy trying to get it all together... or doing
real work for money somewhere... ;)
But seriously, I've had some correspondance with Al Longyear about a
little bug in ppp-2.3.5, and he does respond when he can. I'd guess with
the number of people using ppp, they all probably get rather a lot of
mail about it.
FWIW, I currently use a patched version of ppp-2.3.5 on kernel 2.0.35
mostly, and haven't had time to look in and work out what's been changed
in the versions that come with the kernels. I haven't tried 2.0.36 yet,
as I haven't got a spare machine lying around to test it on. If ppp
stops working on it, I'm up the proverbial creek.
