As I stated before it gives you what it should give: The size of the
filesystem. This resembles what before was known as shmall. 
The kernel interface gives the number of blocks and the blocksize. the
rest is left to df... So the unit it is dependant on the options you
give to df. I prefer 'df -h' which gives you human readable output.
