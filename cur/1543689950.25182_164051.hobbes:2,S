Hi all,
I received one reply to this email.  I take it there is nobody really heading 
up the implementation of improved/missing performance metrics in the kernel?
Is this on anyone's radar?
What is Linus' take on more/better metrics?  
Is he likely to roll them in if they are implemented?
Is there any plan to implement any existing patches? 
If I can get developer time applied to this project, I don't want to re-invent 
the existing pieces.  Who do I coordinate with?
Cordially,
Scott
