Umm, that's what I said.

Nope - they're all single issue CPUs, and, if non-buggy, they guarantee
that stores never bypass loads.  (In a later architecture revision, this
is controllable.)
Remember - ARM CPUs aren't a high spec desktop CPU.  They're an embedded
CPU where power consumption matters.  Superscalar/multiple issue/high
performance isn't viable in such many embedded environments.
