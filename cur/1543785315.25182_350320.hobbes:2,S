Hi. 
With the 2.6.14-rc1 and 2.6.13 kernels, voluntary preempt seems to
prevent HAL from detecting changes in the mount state of any given
volume. Changing the preempt option to None or Full fixes the problem.
I have tested this on my Athlon XP system with HAL 0.5.4. This issue
screws up desktop environments that use HAL to test mount states.
Anyone else seeing this?
