We've been back and forth with that driver, yeah.  It has its own set of 
problems, sometimes it doesnt even autonegotiate properly, falls to 10 half 
duplex, etc.  It also seems to have gotten quite large code wise (code wise) 
in the latest version (1.3.x.something) :)    We dont need any of their 
ans/teaming/proc stuff, but it is stable on this particular problem.
Their driver doesnt even compile out of the box on 2.2.18 btw (intel e100.c 
1.3.2, latest I could find), _badudelay.  I had to change one call to 
mdelay, and comment out their dma_addr_t type because of the conflicting 
declaration.  Doesnt give me much confidence :(

Sorry.  It wasnt my subject though, I was replying to someone else and just 
put the 'Re:' in.  But I will be more careful...
