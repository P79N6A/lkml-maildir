Yes.
What really bugs me about this is that while normally you're hard to
communicate with, this time you have actively _lied_ about the patches on
IRC and in email about how they will cause IDE corruption etc due to
timing changes.
No such timing changes existed, and whenever you were asked about what was
actually actively _wrong_ with the patches, you didn't reply.
There's a difference between being difficult to work with and being 
actively dishonest, and you crossed that line.
