Hi all,
I tried to use kwintv on my desktop with All in Wonder ATI Radeon AGP.
I have compiled my kernel (2.4.18)  with almost all the video drivers 
compiled as module. The problem is that I have tried to upload the 
module bttv.o using the command
   modprobe bttv
and the following messages have  appeared:
/lib/modules/2.4.18-6mdk/kernel/drivers/media/video/bttv.o.gz: 
init_module: No such device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, 
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
modprobe: insmod 
/lib/modules/2.4.18-6mdk/kernel/drivers/media/video/bttv.o.gz failed
modprobe: insmod bttv failed
Can anyone of you help me to understand what is the problem. I think 
that the default IRQ and IO ports are not correct for my video board. If 
so, is it possible have the correct one?
I have tried to search on the Web and in the Linux archives to check if 
these type of errors
have already been solved by someone else, but I haven't found anything.
Thanks in advance for your help.
