Hello again,
Thanks for everyone pointing out the way to use high intensity background
colors instead of blink mode.  For those that missed out, there is a
parameter in the SVGATextMode config file, TextConfig, that allows you to
use 16 colors instead of eight.
When I enable this parameter, I definitely can use high intensity
background colors and they seem to work.  However, they work differently
from other terminals I'm used to such as relisys or DOS.  When using them,
if I print characters out while having background colors on, only those
characters are high intensity, but the rest of the line reverts to the
same color with normal intensity.  Is there any way to change this
behavior (so that the whole line has the high intensity background color)?
I've checked the SVGATextMode documentation and haven't found anything
related.
