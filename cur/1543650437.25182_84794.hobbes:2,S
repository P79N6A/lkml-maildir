Here is a list of things reiser4 needs from the core:
 (1) export of generic_forget_inode()
 (2) export of page_cache_readahead()
 (3) export of remove_from_page_cache()
 (4) export of fsync_super()
 (5) patch to allow safe sharing of ->journal_info pointer in task_struct
     by several users
(1)-(4) are only necessary to compile reiser4 as module.
(5) is good not only for reiser4. Without it different file systems
using ->journal_info cannot "co-exist peacefully".
No new system calls are introduced (yet).
Nikita.
