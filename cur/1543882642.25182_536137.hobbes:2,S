Yes, but when were some of these regressions reported?  Past a certain
point, I think it's reasonable to look at the regression, decide how
many people would be affected by it, and why it hadn't been noticed
earlier, and in some cases, decide that it's better to get this
debugged and fixed in the stable and development trees in parallel.

I agree that's unfortunate.

Everyone is going to disagree to some extent; and their own comfort
zone.  So a certain amount compromise is always going to be necessary.
Of course, it's up to you decide whether this has gone beyond the zone
where you aren't comfortable working with other people's development
style.
