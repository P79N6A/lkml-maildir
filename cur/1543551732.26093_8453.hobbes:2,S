Do you know that there is actually a name for the logical fallacy behind
this sort of argument?
But please, enlighten me, what precisely about having once wrote some file
system code for Linux qualifies one as an expert on the topic of the
relative difficulty of optimizing C and C++  as used in kernel development?
What is it about this group that some of its members so quickly close ranks
around the secret handshake when they don't have an actual response to a
technical point?  And what are you going to say instead when I finally do
get around to contributing code to Linux and I still point out bogosities
when they come up?

the pragmatic and subjective part. Jeff wrote some cool nwfs code for
Linux which is publically available and what useful kernel code for Linux
did you write and where can I download it? Therefore, for this very simple
subjective and pragmatic reason, Jeff (in my eyes) is right and you are
wrong :)
Send patches, not "clever thoughts", clever thoughts are cheap and useless
and can remain confined to the "comp. science departments of certain
universities" for all I care...
