Oh, you mean the array of irq_handlers in the MSI-X table should 
correspond to a particular message ?
I remember sometime back somebody stated that one might not get 
the requested number of handlers what you requested. 
In such a case, if the irq_handlers are mapped in a static fashion, one 
might not get any interrupt callbacks for a specific functionality of 
the hardware. Or is there something missing in what i understood ?
