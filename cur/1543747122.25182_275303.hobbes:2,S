The tricky part is proc_pid_unhash()/proc_pid_flush(): Right now 
removing a pid from the pid bitmap and disabling /proc/<pid>/* is 
atomic: Both operations are done under tasklist_lock.
I think it would be better to modify pid_alive to p->exit_state and 
disable /proc/<pid>/* access when the exit state is set to DEAD, but 
that that would be a larger change. Probably unhash and flush could be 
merged into one function.
But I don't understand the lines in wait_task_zombie that reset 
exit_state from DEAD to ZOMBIE, so perhaps I overlook something.
