In the real world, with the customers to which you've given these
patches, which of these objects is most likely to be consuming the most
space?  Is there one set of objects that we could work on that would fix
_most_ of the cases which you have encountered?

I think you're claiming that doing reclaim of kernel objects causes much
more severe and less recoverable errors than does reclaiming of user
pages.  That might generally be true, but I have one example that's
killing me.  (You shouldn't have mentioned mmap ;)
Let's say you have a memory area mapped by one pagetable page, and with
1 user page mapped in it.  The system is out of memory, and if you
reclaim either the pagetable page or the user page, you're never going
to get it back.
So, you pick the user page to reclaim.  The user touches it, the memory
allocation fails, and the process gets killed.
Instead, you reclaim the pagetable page.  The user touches their page,
the memory allocation for the pagetable fails, and the process gets
killed.  
Seems like the same end result to me.
