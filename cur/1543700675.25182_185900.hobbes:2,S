    Hmm, my Quad PPro Proliant 5000 has been working fine with 2.6
kernels, but it's an older model of course.  I'm still learning about
these Compaqs.  Same chipset though.

    I think I can safely say the two ACPI errors mean your 6500 doesn't
support ACPI, which doesn't surprise me.
    I wonder if booting with acpi=off might fix both (1) and (2)?
I know there are two methods of detecting and setting up SMP, one via
ACPI.  I think it's supposed to fall back to the older MPS SMP stuff
but Compaqs are weird.  I've built my own kernels since day one with
ACPI off and never had this problem.
    I haven't looked, but I'd guess that the difference between the
RH9 kernel and the Fedora 2.4 kernel is the new ACPI stuff too.

    What do you mean by 'cannot determine the bus topology'?  Are you
getting an error message?  Does this occur with both 2.6
and 2.4.22-blah?
    If turning ACPI off too doesn't fix all this, a copy of your dmesg
output would probably be helpful.  I beat my 5000 into submission, so
maybe I can help.
