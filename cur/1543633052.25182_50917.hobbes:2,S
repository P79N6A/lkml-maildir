We don't do anything special.  I'm not sure what the fragmentation
statistics look like on machines with 1+GB memory; it's something I
have been wondering about and hoping to look into at some point (if
someone has done that already, I'd love to see the results).  In
practice, every ia64 linux distro as of today ships with 16KB page
size, so you only get order-1 allocations for stacks.
