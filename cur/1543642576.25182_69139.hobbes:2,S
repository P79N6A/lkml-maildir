Hi All,
 I am porting an application from windows to linux.
 The application uses both interval timesr and sleep.
 I came to know that in Linux we can not use both
 setitimer and sleep in the application. Because both 
 of them rely on SIGALRM.
 Can somebody tell me how to come out of this problem.
Thanks and Regards,
 --thomas
