This does not look right. We can sometimes have put_user() of non-integer 
types (say structures). How does the (int)__ret_pu cast work in that case? 
We'll fall into this branch in that case:
        default:                                                \
                __put_user_x(X, __pu_val, ptr, __ret_pu);       \
                break;                                          \
and __ret_pu has a nonsensical type in that case.

Is this all that you need (plus the 16-bit setup code tweaks) to get LLVM 
to successfully build a 64-bit kernel image?
If yes then this doesnt look all that bad or invasive at first sight (if 
the put_user() workaround can be expressed in a cleaner way), but in any 
case it would be nice to hear an LLVM person's opinion about roughly when 
this is going to be solved in LLVM itself.
