No need for CIA/KGB.  There are companies that do more than this.  
If necessary, they disassemble the drive in a clean room and use 
their own reading equipment.  This allows recovery
from fried drive electronics and broken motors/heads.  And sometimes
(partial) recovery from scratches and other bad sectors.
