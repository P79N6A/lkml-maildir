Yes that works fine.
But the problem is when people pass pointers to structures and
copy_*_user them later. And they near always do. Structures need to be 
converted when they contain pointers or long long (on x86-64/ia64 long 
long has different alignment than ia32 long long)

The application does not need to be ported. That's the whole point
of the emulation layer. Just the in kernel stuff needs to be.

You can specify clean data types. But it's very likely that eventually
someone fucks up and adds something that needs to be translated
(at least it's very likely with such an 'designed to be extensible'
interface like you have) 
And then having a basic design that makes translation impossible would
be unfortunate.
