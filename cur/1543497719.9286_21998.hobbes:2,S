	I have got that as well on against one of our Solaris 2.5.1
	servers. One gives a 'poor' but not so bad performance compared
	to the other one (client is 2.2.6-ac1, 2.2.7-ac1 or 2.2.9) :
        1400809 bytes/second for writing the file
        1640707 bytes/second for reading the file
	Using FreeBSD against the same 'medium' gives better results :
        3865717 bytes/second for writing the file
        3573897 bytes/second for reading the file
	The Dual Entreprise 450 gives between 80 Ko/s and 100 Ko/s
	(using 2.2.6-ac1, 2.2.7-ac1 or stock 2.2.9) writing, and 3,0 Mo/s
	reading. Both servers seem to have the same patches applied, so I do
	not really understand (maybe the 'slow' server is running log file
	systems, and not the other one).
	Using FreeBSD against the same 'slow' server gives better results
	(but really not amazing given the supposed performance of the U450) :
        1377439 bytes/second for writing the file
        3491616 bytes/second for reading the file
	However, just to remind, FreeBSD against a Linux 2.2.9/Knfsd
	gives 7,8 Mo/s writing and 6,8 Mo/s reading.
	To me, it seems that 2.2.x series behaves really worst than
	2.0.x against Solaris servers, and much better against Linux
	servers.
