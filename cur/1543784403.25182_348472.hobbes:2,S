I don't think it's a good idea to have two different ways
to do kallsyms. Either we should always use your new
way in standard KALLSYMS or not do it at all.
The major decision factor is how much bloat it adds.
Can you post before/after numbers of binary size? 
If the difference is >5% or so - are there ways to recover
the difference?
