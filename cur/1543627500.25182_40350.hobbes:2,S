Dear all,
    I'd like to announce publication of Linux Kernel State Tracer (LKST) 1.0,
  which is a tracer for Linux kernel.
    LKST's main purpose is debugging, fault analysis and performance analysis of
  enterprise systems.
    For the purpose, LKST has these features,
        - It is possible to change dynamically which events are recorded.
          Developers can obtain information about the events which they
         concern only interesting events.
          And, It reduces the overhead of components which is not related
         with trouble.
        - It is possible to change each function invoked each events.
          A default function of all events is just recording the events.
          But, if it is necessary, default function can be changed to
         another function.
          For example, this feature can be used as following:
            + Notify user processes when the function detects abnormal status.
            + Change a maskset,which controls what type of events should be
             recorded, dynamically by the function.
             ->  The system can usually run with a few events trace for the
                 cause of good performance. And, when the function detects
                abnormal status, it can change a maskset to get more
                detail information.
          Users can create and install any function as kernel module.
     We released the beta version of LKST in January, 2002. And the followings are
   added with the LKST 1.0.
      - Replace the current trace hooks with Kernel Hooks (formerly known as GKHI)
        by IBM.
      - Integrate with Linux Kernel Crash Dump (LKCD) to analyze the trace data
        in a crash dump.
      - Making of daemon that saves trace data into log files.
    Note: The LKCD patch is not a official patch. If the official patch is released,
       we will replace it with the official patch and release the LKST again.
    LKST binaries, source code and documents are available in the following site,
