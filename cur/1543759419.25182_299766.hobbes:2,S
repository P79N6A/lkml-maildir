Stephen,
I looked at few journalling bugs recently on RHEL4 testing here.
I am wondering if your patch fixes this following BUG also ?
I never got to bottom of some of these journal panics -
since they are not easily reproducible + I don't understand
journal code well enough :(
Assertion failure in journal_commit_transaction() at fs/jbd/commit.c:790: "jh->b_next_transaction == ((void *)0)"
kernel BUG in journal_commit_transaction at fs/jbd/commit.c:790!
cpu 0x8: Vector: 700 (Program Check) at [c00000001fcc3870]
    pc: d0000000000a7cd4: .journal_commit_transaction+0x1378/0x155c [jbd]
    lr: d0000000000a7cd0: .journal_commit_transaction+0x1374/0x155c [jbd]
    sp: c00000001fcc3af0
   msr: 8000000000029032
  current = 0xc00000002fd86b30
  paca    = 0xc0000000003de000
    pid   = 272, comm = kjournald
enter ? for help
Thanks,
Badari
