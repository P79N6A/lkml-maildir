ugh.  GFP_NOIO is evil.  I guess it's better to add __GFP_HIGH
there, but it's not a happy solution.

Is OK - that's just overeager whining.  You received an IO error
during a write.  This marks the buffer not uptodate.  (Heaven
knows why, because it clearly *is* uptodate).  And try_to_free_buffers
doesn't like seeing a non-uptodate buffer against an uptodate
page: it violates the alleged page/buffer state coherency.
Some sucker needs to go through and test-n-fix all the IO handling
paths.  He'll probably leave that until after "feature freeze".
