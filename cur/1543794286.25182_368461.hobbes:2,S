Well, I think 10 seconds when suspending is a nice and resonable
number. For resume though I think we should wait much longer, maybe
even indefinitely - the only thing that timeout achieves is makes
people fsck because the system can't recover from that state.
In any case the attached should make input more swsusp friendly by
checking freeze condition after processing one event instead of all
pending events.
