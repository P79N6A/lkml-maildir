what i've implemented in my tree is sys_async_call_table[] which is a 
copy of sys_call_table[] with certain entries modified (by architecture 
level code, not by kernel/async.c) to sys_ni_syscall(). It's up to the 
architecture to decide which syscalls are allowed.
but i could use a bitmap too - whatever linear construct. [ I'm not sure 
there's much connection to seccomp - seccomp uses a NULL terminated 
whitelist - while syslets would use most of the entries (and would not 
want to have the overhead of checking a blacklist). ]
