Of course. Sometimes when I'm debugging I make stuff manually with
EXTRA_CFLAGS='-O1 -g', and sometimes I'll probably want do the build
with CONFIG_COMBINED_COMPILE= as well.
That should certainly be possible -- and it _is_ possible with my
makefile hack but mostly by chance. It's a feature which we should
probably try to keep though.
