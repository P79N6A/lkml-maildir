No, I do not want to deal with multiple processes. Chrome code is not
*as* evil as you paint it... But yes, chroot is a nice idea. Doing
chroot into nowhere after freezing system will prevent most stupid
mistakes. Rest of userland is frozen, so it can not do anything really
wrong (at most you deadlock), if you kill someone -- well, that's only
as dangerous as any other code running as root.

I'm going to solve that one with big warning, at the begining of
suspend program. If someone can't read, I'll laugh at them. How was
your acronym -- BTDTSHTFTS?
[There's similary dangerous code in /sys/power/resume, today. Distros
actually use it. It only costed one filesystem... I killed 3
filesystems myself, and one underlated with memcpy<->strcpy
bug. So... it is not really that dangerous.]

...don't worry about distros, they are not _that_ stupid, and they are
already doing eye candy at weird places today (grub, kernel).
