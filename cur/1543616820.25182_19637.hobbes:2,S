I guess the point here is that you don't save anything over the diet
libc.  I went to great lengths to make sure not using printf would not
incur any overhead.  So if klibc is diet libc without printf, then using
klibc won't produce smaller binaries than using diet libc (unless you
use printf, of course, in which case klibc won't work at all).
By the way: one more architecture is now supported by the diet libc:
hp pa-risc.  Someone surprised me by sending a patch.
