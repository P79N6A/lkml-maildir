Fixed fnode block contains (txc,cc) pair describing which fnode and nlink 
count is valid. --- currently two fnodes are superflous (there could be 
just one), they are reserved for the possibility to atomically modify 
extended attributes --- but there is no code currently that does it.
The fnodes live on their own with their own (txc,cc) pair --- it is a bit 
confusing to have pair on both fixed_fnode_block and fnode --- the reason 
is that the code for handling fnodes in directories can be reused to 
handle fnodes in fixed_fnode_blocks and I can avoid many
if (is_fnode_fixed()) branches.
If the fnode in fixed_fnode_block has invalid crash count, 
fixed_fnode_block's (cc,txc) pair should never point to it. Or did it 
happen to you?
