A new function will be necessary, like:
    cap_value_t cap_get_value_by_name(const char *cap_name);
If a program tries to use specific capabilities explicitly, it can
apply pre-defined capability code like CAP_MAC_ADMIN.
However, when we implement a program which can deal with arbitrary
capabilities, it should obtain codes of them dynamically, because
it enables to work itself on the feature kernel.
