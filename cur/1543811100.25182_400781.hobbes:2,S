I think voluntary preempt is generally a good idea, but we should make it optional
for down() since it can apparently cause bad side effects (like holding 
semaphores/mutexes for too long) 
There would be two possible ways: 
have default mutex_lock()/down() do a might_sleep()
with preemption and have a separate variant that doesn't preempt
or have the default non preempt and a separate variant
that does preempt. 
I think I would prefer the later because for preemption 
it probably makes often more sense to do the preemption
on the up() not the down.
On the other hand one could argue that it's safer to only
change it for mmap_sem, which would suggest a special variant
without preemption and keep the current default.
Actually the non preempt variants probably should still have a might_sleep() 
for debugging, but in a variant that doesn't do preemption (might_sleep_no_preempt()?) 
Ingo, what do you think?
