That is clearly another thing and would probably need to be
demonstrated. Anyway, the AT* problem[1] doesn't require a user
action and the fix proposed (if correct) would fix the real AT*
problem instead.
[1] I don't call it a bug, it's rather a lack of functionality,
we just don't seem to support dial-in Hayes modems with serial
console.
I don't see any FUD here.
