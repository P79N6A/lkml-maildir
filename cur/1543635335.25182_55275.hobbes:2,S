If you plug any hotplug devices, the kernel allocates some space for the 
control structures, and if you unplug it, structures get unallocated. No 
need to do it as a module. Kernel grows _and_ shrinks on runtime, even 
with CONFIG_MODULE=n.

Our discussion is not _whether_ to support module unloading, but how to 
support it sensibly on SMP systems.
