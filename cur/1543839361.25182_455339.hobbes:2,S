Yes, the documentation definitely needs more work.

Processes are not moved from one integrity level to another, but are
demoted when they read from a lower integrity level object. By
definition sockets, are defined as UNTRUSTED, so reading from a
socket demotes the process to UNTRUSTED.  (Secrecy is a separate
attribute.) In the Mozilla example, /usr/bin/mozilla is defined as
SYSTEM, preventing any process with lesser integrity from modifying
it.  'level -s' displays the level of the current process or of a
given file.  For example,
[zohar@L3X098X ~]$ level -s /usr/bin/mozilla
/usr/bin/mozilla
        security.slim.level: SYSTEM PUBLIC
Both mozilla and firefox-bin are defined as SYSTEM, as soon as the
firefox-bin process opens a socket, the process is demoted to
UNTRUSTED.
I hope this answered some of your questions.  We're working on
more comprehensive documentation, which we'll post with the next
release.
