Does anyone know if the Linksys LNE100TX PCI 10/100 card is supported?
Not sure what kind of chipset it is based on; the main chip on the board
reads:
LINKSYS
LNE100TX
LC82C169
9839
AN5085.1
So I guess it's an 82c169. The card is sold as the "Linksys EtherFast",
and there have been (aparrantly, from the linksys site) three versions
of the card, each with different chipsets. One of the revs used the DEC
tulip chip, but I do not believe that this one does.
If anyone is interested in writing a driver, I will donate a card.
