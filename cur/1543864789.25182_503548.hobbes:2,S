The big thing was the new table manager.
Linux used to have multiple copies of the ACPI tables -- sometimes inconsistent.
Now, we use a single copy of each table.
Indeed, with the exception of the FADT -- where we need to convert multiple
versions into a single version, we map the tables directly where the BIOS
gives them to us and thus don't allocate any memory for them at all.
cheers,
