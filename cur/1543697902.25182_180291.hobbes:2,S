Using /proc/partitions for finding the existing block devices /
partitions does seem to be kind of obsolete, as sysfs exports all of
this information too?
So, if anything, I'd drop the confusing redundancy and kill
/proc/partitions - the names there may have little resemblance to how
udev (et al) chose to name the device node in the filesystem anyway.
Sincerely,
