Hi!
Is getrusage properly implemented in 2.6?
The man pages state:
   Right  now  (Linux  2.4,  2.6)  only  the  fields
   ru_utime,  ru_stime, ru_minflt, ru_majflt, and ru_nswap are maintained.
but some tests comparing UDP and TCP sending operations give some strange 
numbers for both the user and kernel times!?
PS! Does Linux 2.6 support zero-copy TCP send?
Thank you.
