Hi, list!
I have a question about coding style in linux kernel. In
Documention/CodingStyle, it is said that "Linux style for comments is
the C89 "/* ... */" style. Don't use C99-style "// ..." comments."
_But_ I see a lot of '//' style comments in current kernel code.
Which is wrong? The documentions or the code, or neither? And why?
Another question is about NULL. AFAIK, in user space, using NULL is
better than directly using 0 in C. In kernel, I know it used its own
NULL, which may be defined as ((void*)0), but it's _still_ different
from raw zero. So can I say using NULL is better than 0 in kernel?
Any reply is welcome. Thanks and have a nice day!
