	Okay, first, assume that 'vfork' on Linux is never going to do anything but
copy-on-write. If we make 'vfork' keep only a single shared set of pages,
the rest of this argument melts away. (If we're going to have a 'vfork' that
isn't identical to 'fork', this is the right way, more or less.)
	Assume also that overcommitting is turned off. If overcommitting is turned
on, it's perfectly fine to let a 'fork'/'vfork' succeed even if later on we
might not have enough pages.
	Given these two assumptions, I believe it is disastrous to allow 'vfork' to
succeed if there aren't enough swap pages to back every single copy-on-write
page. The problem is, this could get us into an overcommit situation later
on down the line (when another process dirties a shared page after this one
already has), and it may not be possible to kill this particular process at
that particular time, forcing us to kill an innocent process due to memory
exhaustion.
	If overcommitting has been turned off, that should be that.,
