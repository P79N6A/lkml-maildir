Hello all
The function
static int size_fifo(struct async_struct *info)
{
...
ends as follows:
	serial_outp(info, UART_LCR, UART_LCR_DLAB);
	serial_outp(info, UART_DLL, old_dll);
	serial_outp(info, UART_DLM, old_dlm);
	return count;
}
Which means, that DLAB is not re-set, and, in particular, all subsequent
read/write operations on offsets 0 and 1 will not affect the data and
interrupt enable registers, but the divisor latch register... Or is this
register somehow magically restored elsewhere or by the hardware (say, on
an interrupt)? This function seems to be only called for startech UARTs.
Thanks
Guennadi
