If the scheduling topology is updated atomically (ie. inside
__cpu_disable), this would not happen; there are patches around to do
this and I think longer term this is the correct fix.  However, I
believe a good current fix is to merely ensure that the current cpu is
always set in dependent_sleeper(), something like:L
	/*
	 * The same locking rules and details apply as for
	 * wake_sleeping_dependent():
	 */
	spin_unlock(&this_rq->lock);
	cpus_and(sibling_map, sd->span, cpu_online_map);
+	/* Include this CPU, for special case of going us dying */
+	cpu_set(this_cpu, sibling_map);
	for_each_cpu_mask(i, sibling_map)
		spin_lock(&cpu_rq(i)->lock);
	cpu_clear(this_cpu, sibling_map);
Not quite free, but very cheap...
