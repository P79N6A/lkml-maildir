I'd like to know if a program can create a pipe (well duh <g>) and listen on
it to write out some data, close it and re-open it (and do the same thing
all over again).  When I opened a pipe in non-block mode, I couldn't write
to it and it would always be ready for write.
To your question, I don't believe you can lseek it or anything, IIRC, it
acts like a set of descriptors you get when using pipe(2) except it is
opened instead of using pipe.
