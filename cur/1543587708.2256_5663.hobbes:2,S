Thanks, I can now mount affs filesystems. However when I try to write
to it via "cp somefile /amiga/somefile" I get a segmentation fault. If
I then do a "df -h" it hangs the system very much like the mount command
did before I installed your tar-ball. Was write support expected from
it.
Are you the NEW maintainer of the affs stuff. I very much appreciate
your
response and if I can help in any way just let me know. I use affs quite
a bit here at work in conjunction with UAE and real amigas.
I also received a response from I guess the original
maintainer,           Hans-Joachim Widmaier <hjw@zvw.de>.
I quote:
"?affs is broken since somewhere in 2.3.xx. Alas, I do not have
the time
anymore to do anything about it, and my Amiga ran its last
program, too,
so I cannot test anymore. Last I know is that several guys
wanted to
look after affs in 2.4--at least make it run--, but it seems
that nothing
much has been done in that way. :-(
Sorry for not bearing better news."

I was very much relieved to from you as I know have HOPE for a
completely working affs again.
