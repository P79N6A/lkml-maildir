Not particularly. It largely means poorly-coded apps may report gibberish.

That's fine. Do these error messages specify which field access(es)
caused the error?

Then assuming the error messages indicate which field access(es) caused
the error(s), you're already done; userspace must merely retry the
request with the offending fields cast out. Otherwise, you're still
done: userspace can merely retry the field accesses one at a time
(though it's nicer to say which ones caused the errors).

Yes, that was the "slower and stupider than thou" option. You've
already vectorized field access requests, of which I heartily approve.
