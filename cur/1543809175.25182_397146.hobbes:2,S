The reference timex.h has the same change for MAXPHASE and NTP_PHASE_LIMIT 
is Linux specific. Where is the problem?

Ok, I didn't put much effort into optimizing it for uncommon HZ values. 
Why is it so important? It's currently unused on any Linux machine 
synchronized via NTP.

Actually it's not that hard, under 
http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/ntp/
 you 
can also find the user space test code I used to verify it.
kernel.tar.Z is the old reference code, which the current Linux code is 
based on, under patches-kernel you can find a number of patches to convert 
it to the new model and which match the new kernel implementation.
I updated the kern.dat and added a nano.sh script with matching test 
parameters for nanokernel, so you can compare the output of both test 
programms.
