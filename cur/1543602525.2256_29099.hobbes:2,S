Hello!
When I call interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(), the complete systems
stops/hangs, even with small timeout values. This happens only on an
Abit KT7A (VIA chip set) motherboard with an Athlon processor, other
motherboards (different manufactors) behave normally.
I call the function during the initialization of a PCI device, but
during the sleep the device is not generating traffic on the PCI bus.
Any idea where this might come from?
I'm using kernel version 2.4.9.
bye
Norbert
