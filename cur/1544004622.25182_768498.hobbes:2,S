Do you have any benchmark results?
I'm especially interested in the followings:
- Comparison of disk performance with and without the I/O controller patch.
- Put uneven I/O loads. Processes, which belong to a cgroup which is
  given a smaller weight than another cgroup, put heavier I/O load
  like the following.
     echo 1024 > /cgroup/bio/test1/bio.shares
     echo 8192 > /cgroup/bio/test2/bio.shares
     echo $$ > /cgroup/bio/test1/tasks
     dd if=/somefile1-1 of=/dev/null &
     dd if=/somefile1-2 of=/dev/null &
     ... 
     dd if=/somefile1-100 of=/dev/null
     echo $$ > /cgroup/bio/test2/tasks
     dd if=/somefile2-1 of=/dev/null &
     dd if=/somefile2-2 of=/dev/null &
     ...
     dd if=/somefile2-10 of=/dev/null &
