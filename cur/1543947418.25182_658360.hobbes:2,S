Well, it looks like Michael is not the bcm43xx maintaner. I sent the
patch to him,
because it was his code that broke the driver, and I thought it would
be easy for him to review my patch, as it touches his code.
I'll resend the patch to the proper maintainers now.

Well, if you read my first email, that is exactly what I intended to
do, but even if
Michael would be able to fix the b43 driver to work with my hardware, the code
will only show up in 2.6.25, leaving some 2.6.24 users with broken
wifi. So I thought
it would be a good thing to add my simple fix that enabled the old driver to the
-stable tree, so that we could have working wifi soon.
This is still my intension, I'll resend to the proper maintainters.
