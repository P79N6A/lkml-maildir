Don't know what it is, but most certainly not a temperature sensor.

If ACPI gets the temperature value from the W83627HF chip as the
w83627hf driver does, I would expect concurrent access issues. If you
are having temperature readings trouble again, try only using either of
the (ACPI) thermal or w83627hf drivers, not both, and see if things
improve.
I have no idea how such conflicts can be prevented in the big picture.
