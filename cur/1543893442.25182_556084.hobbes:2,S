Andrew,
My restore-shmid-as-inode-to-fix-proc-pid-maps-abi-breakage.patch is
definitely needed for 2.6.22 to fix ABI issue.
Eric's patch goes beyond and provides same naming convention for
hugetlbfs backed shm segs (which we never did in the past). So,
its not absolutely need for 2.6.22. You can queue up for next 
release,  unless Albert really wants to extend proc-ps utils for
hugetlbfs segments too.
But, its very simple patch - you might as well push this too.
Thanks,
Badari
