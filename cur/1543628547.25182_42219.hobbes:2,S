You need two rmmod -a sweeps with no intervening activity on the module
before the module will be autocleaned.  See MOD_VISITED.  Unless the
first process hangs in the kernel for minutes, it will find the module
still present, use the module and cancel the rmmod -a status.
BTW, I do not disagree that module unloading in general is racy,
especially for ancillary data such as exception tables, unwind data,
timers, kernel threads etc.  Which is why Rusty and I plan to rewrite
module loading and unloading in 2.5.  I just do not see a race in the
area you are looking at.
