I can help some here but probably no more than you (in fact, you've
spotted far more [> 0] issues with the current code than I).
Basically, if you want fast string lookup of compressed stuff I can sit
down with whiteboard etc. and fiddle around, but it sounds like from f's
comments that this isn't really wanted.
So the end-result of the discussion is, "What should really happen here?"
and "What, if anything, do you want me to do?"
