Hello,
The <linux/file.h> contains two inlines:
/*
 * Check whether the specified task has the fd open. Since the task
 * may not have a files_struct, we must test for p->files != NULL.
 */
extern inline struct file * fcheck_task(struct task_struct *p, unsigned
int fd)
{
        struct file * file = NULL;
        if (p->files && fd < p->files->max_fds)
                file = p->files->fd[fd];
        return file; 
}
/*
 * Check whether the specified fd has an open file.
 */
extern inline struct file * fcheck(unsigned int fd)
{
        struct file * file = NULL;
        if (fd < current->files->max_fds)
                file = current->files->fd[fd];
        return file;
}
Correspondingly, why does fget(fd) use fcheck(fd) and not fcheck_task(fd,
current)? If there are any circumstances when p->files == NULL then it
should be made clear (e.g. to be used by malicious crackers to panic the
system from a simple userspace program). If, however, there is no such
possibility then it should also be made clear by removing the check in
fcheck_task().
Any thoughts?
Regards,
