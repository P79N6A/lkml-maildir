Back without APIC now - and the machine is stable again. Clock is still
screwed however.

Last night I set another machine doing:
(while sleep 600; do ssh screwedbox ntpdate goodbox; done) | tee ntp.log
The results (attached) are interesting. It appears that my clock drift
problem occurs every hour.  Perhaps it is APM related?? Load doesn't seem
to make any difference. And there's never two consecutive ntpdate's that
are a long way out - suggesting that whenever the problem occurs it's then
fixed temporarily when ntpdate sets the clock.
Anyone have any suggestions as to what to try next? Shall I try compiling
a kernel with APM support and see if I can turn off anything that might be
causing troubs? I'm *sure* I turned off any mention of power management in
the BIOS....
