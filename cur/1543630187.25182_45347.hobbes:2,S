So, what to do?  For ARM and MIPS we could go back to solution 1:
+#if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN) || (BITS_PER_LONG > 32)
+char jiffies_at_jiffies_64[0];
+#elif ! defined(__BIG_ENDIAN)
+#ERROR "Neither __LITTLE_ENDIAN nor __BIG_ENDIAN defined "
+#endif
With this in the ld script file: 
jiffies = DEFINED(jiffies_at_jiffies_64) ? jiffies_64 : jiffies_64+4;
This would work no matter what endian was used.  If this is to be the ARM/ MIPS 
answer, what file should the #if... go in?
