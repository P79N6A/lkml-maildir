Well the fun thing is the cdrom is doing 2.5meg/s while the HD
is sucking much butt at 150-170kps :/

1001.root@kinder:/root>> hdparm -X66 -d1 /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 setting xfermode to 66 (UltraDMA mode2)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
1003.root@kinder:/root>> hdparm -i /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd:
