yep, i was concentrating on fileserving load.

i'd love to first see these kinds of applications (under Linux) before
designing for them. Eg. if an IO operation (eg. streaming video webcast)
does a DMA from a camera card to an outgoing networking card, would it be
possible to access the packet data in case of a TCP retransmit? Basically
these applications are limited enough in scope to justify even temporary
'hacks' that enable them - and once we *see* things in action, we could
design for them. Not the other way around.
