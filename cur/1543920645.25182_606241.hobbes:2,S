Yup, I found the patch you mentioned also, but that time orginating from 
Nick Cheng (*).
That diff is unfortunately way too big for me to be able to decide, if it's 
worth it to replace a former instance of arcmsr-1.20.0.13 for a 2.6.18.8 
kernel, which I use and essentially depend on here.
Thus I decided now to bluntly cc Nick and ask directly this way:
Nick, does 1.20.0.15 provide any essential changes over 1.20.0.13 for a 
ARC-1130 with FW 1.41 (2006-05-24), which advise updating?

(*) Thanks for the clarification, Björn. What made me stumbling was the 
different orginators, while Jeff isn't known with catching attention by 
assimilating other peoples contributions.
