Subject: strange incremental patch size [2.6.12-rc2 to 2.6.12-rc3]

Hi,
These are the sizes of rc2 and rc3 patches
# ls -la patch-2.6.12*
-rw-r--r--  1 root src 18011382 Apr  4 18:50 patch-2.6.12-rc2
-rw-r--r--  1 root src 19979854 Apr 21 02:29 patch-2.6.12-rc3
Let us make an incremental patch from rc2 to rc3
# interdiff patch-2.6.12-rc2 patch-2.6.12-rc3 >x
Let us see how big it is.
# ls -ld x
-rw-r--r--  1 root src 37421924 Apr 21 12:28 x
How come interdiff from rc2 (18MB) to rc3 (20MB) gave me
37MB worth of patch-code ? I would expect something about
2MB but 40MB ?
The patching with the incremental patch took very long compared
to other rc2-rc3-type patches, that is how I noticed it.
Regards,
Maciej
