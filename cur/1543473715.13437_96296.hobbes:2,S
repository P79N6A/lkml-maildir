FWIW, I had an experience doing some work for Phillip Morris 
where they had me connect two (PowerMacs?) laptops with a SCSI 
cable (actually, two cables hooked together).  I didn't really get to 
much of a chance to quiz the guy on what was going on, but it 
worked quite nicely.  I believe that, except for the home made cable, 
it was a program run on the Mac which made the connection 
possible.  This means (to me, anyway, not being a programmer) that 
perhaps somebody could write a kernel module of some sort to do 
this.  Anyway, all this to say, I have seen it work, but don't exactly 
know how.
