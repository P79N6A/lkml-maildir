However a few months ago I got this new Asus K8S-MX motherboard and, when I installed my ide harddrive on the system and editted my kernel to support my new hardware, I found that my SiS 5513 support wasn't working. I had no DMA and my system would end up slowing to a crawl and swap-thrashing within minutes after boot (mind you this is an AMD64 2800+ with 512MB PC3200 DDR i'm talking about here).

www.google.com + "sis5513 k8s-mx linux" works for me
code a bit and found the problem (I think). For some reason the SiS
5513 code contained in the kernel tree doesn't look for the 0x5513
device id at all. I'm not sure why that is... on my system the device
id is 0x5513 which makes sense considering the name of the chipset :P.

First off, in /usr/src/linux/drivers/ide/pci/sis5513.c, when scanning for devices, the closest it gets to the 5513 chipset is the 5511 (PCI_DEVICE_ID_SI_5511) as far as I can tell. Which, according to /usr/src/linux/include/linux/pci_ids.h, has the value of 0x5511. I simply added an entry to /usr/src/linux/include/linux/pci_ids.h for the 0x5513 device id ("#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_SI_5513           0x5513") and appended this line to the SiSHostChipInfo structure array:         "{ "SiS5513",    PCI_DEVICE_ID_SI_5513,  ATA_133  },"

I'm not sure if 5513 chipsets on other motherboards don't have the 0x5513 device id or why. When I called Asus to ask about it they said they don't modify any of the chips they get from other manufacturers so...

Unfortunately this is a wrong solution and has been NAK-ed at least once.
SiS965L support is being currently discussed and will be soon merged
into mainline.
Thanks,
