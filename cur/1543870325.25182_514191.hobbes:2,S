Well, that would be quite strange - as far as I known linux network
stack (for which kevent was originally created to support network AIO),
there should not be any difference.
Anyway, I've reran the test with the same values:
# ab -c8000 -n80000

Yes, that should be done of course.
I even have a plan to create the same binary for both, but have also in
plans to turn some kevent optimization (mainly readiness-on-submit, when
requested event (secv/send/anything) is ready immediately - kevent
supports to return that event in the submission syscall without
additional overhead by reading it from ring or queue).
