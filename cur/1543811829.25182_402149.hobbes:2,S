If the patch is deemed too intrusive then that's what I'll do; I nearly
did so originally but when I caught myself cut and pasting the code from
nand_base I thought my patch was the cleaner way.
The patch shouldn't cause any extra work for anyone that I can see and I
don't think it's intrusive at all; I submitted it because I figured it
might save someone else some work down the line as well.
