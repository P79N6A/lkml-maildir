Yes, and yes.  Aunt Tillie is running Linux because someone installed a
distribution for her.
She is never going to need anything out of her kernel that her vendor-shipped
update kernels do not provide.  She is never going to need the 1% performance
difference she might she if she custom-compiled a kernel for her architecture
rather than using the closest one shipped by her vendor.

No.  We're supposed to be about stuff that works.  Vendor-shipped kernels work
for 99.9% of people.  The remaining 0.1% have no need for an
"auto-configurator".
