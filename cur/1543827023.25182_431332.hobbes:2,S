The slightly more complex choice that would be to extend
scsi_test_unit_ready() to allow the sending of a sense header pointer.
Then any user could use the sense return data for setting local
flags ... and thus, they could be kept local.

Well ... that's where I think we follow the CD people, since they're the
ones who have this occurring the most often.
