Well, I tried with both 2.6.8-rc2-mm1 with and without my patch and got
the exact same results:
# echo disk > /sys/power/state
Stopping tasks: =
Then it freezes.  
Pat, since I'm sure you already have swsusp working on your machine,
would you mind giving my patch a try?  I have the feeling doing a
compile and a couple of boots will be a lot faster than me trying to
debug why it's freezing on me.
