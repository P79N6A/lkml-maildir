Surely a simple 5 step procedure is easier :
$ cd ~/linux-2.6.14.5                   # change into the kernel source dir
$ patch -p1 -R < ../patch-2.6.14.5      # revert the 2.6.14.5 patch
$ patch -p1 < ../patch-2.6.15         # apply the new 2.6.15 patch
$ cd ..
$ mv linux-2.6.14.5 linux-2.6.15      # rename the kernel source dir
That's assuming you have already gunzip'ed the patch, but even if you
have not it's still just as easy :
$ cd ~/linux-2.6.14.5                   # change into the kernel source dir
$ zcat ../patch-2.6.14.5.gz | patch -p1 -R     # revert the 2.6.14.5 patch
$ zcat ../patch-2.6.15.gz | patch -p1        # apply the new 2.6.15 patch
$ cd ..
$ mv linux-2.6.14.5 linux-2.6.15      # rename the kernel source dir
No need to jump through 14 hoops.
And it's even nicely documented.
