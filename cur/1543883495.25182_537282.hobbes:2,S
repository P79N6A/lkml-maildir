It depends on what you consider failure and what you consider success.
For me, it failed. Not because it wasn't perfect, but because we could 
have done much better with fixing the known regressions, and also by not 
introducing several regressions between the last -rc and the final 
kernel (and people who did test -rc7 and would most likely also have 
tested an -rc8 ran into them).
