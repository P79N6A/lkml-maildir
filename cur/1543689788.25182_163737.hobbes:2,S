I want to change my keymaps, y'know you press some button and a asci/utf-whatever
character appears... Is there a tutorial to do this somewhere, if not, how do
I do it? I wanna change a keyboard key so something else appears
when I press shift and D. Instead of a capital D.
Thanks dudes, keep up the good work.
Lars.
