You could change things so that the "driver" exported to the driver-model
core really lives in the SCSI mid-layer and simply contains stubs that
reflect things like remove(), shutdown(), and so on to the actual
upper-layer driver.  Or am I missing some fundmental reason why this 
wouldn't be a good idea?
