Yes, this is a separate but related issue: some system calls
are not restarted by SA_RESTART.  This set of system calls
overlaps with, but is not quite the same as, the set of
system calls that demonstrate the stop+SIGCONT ==> EINTR
strangeness.  I thought to tackle the latter problem
first (since the fix seems easy), and then perhaps
get onto the other one later (it is more likely to
lead to visible ABI changes).
Cheers,
Michael
