Martin has just observed what appears to be the same failure on
2.5.71-mjb1, which is the deadline scheduler, using qlogicisp.
Again, some IO appears to have been submitted but it never came back.
It could be a bug in the requests queueing code somewhere, or in the device
driver.
So a good thing to do now would be to find the workload+IO
scheduler+filesystem which triggers it most easily, and run that with a
different device driver.  The feral driver (drivers/scsi/isp/ in -mm)
should be suitable for that test.
