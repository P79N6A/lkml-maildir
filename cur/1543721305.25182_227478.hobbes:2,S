I would love to be able to limit this kind of memory use.
I've always liked how BSD works in this area, never using over a certain
amount.
I find the Linux behavior of using all memory for things like
buffercache is less than optimal.  While there are situations where it
helps, there are a great many where it hurts.
I frequently do work which fills memory with data I'll never use again,
and it makes things slow.
Desktop work tends to do this kind of thing as well.

Not only that, but I wish certain bits of code could be locked into
memory.  Generally any code and data associated with the user interface
should always be there.
It's annoying when a menu in X takes ten seconds of swapping to appear.
