That's no longer in Greg's tree.

I have unhappy feelings here - the patches seem to be churning a bit
and when I last sent them to Greg and Ingo they received no apparent
response.
So I think I'll just drop all four.  Please redo, retest and fully
resubmit, thanks.
And we need to work out who owns these patches.  Are they rightly part of
the PCI tree, or of the x86 tree?
