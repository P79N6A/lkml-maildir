I would love to put my inodes on a diet.  It is just a matter of time
and priorities.  To me the 512 bytes on the stack are unfortunate, but
not a show stopper.  Crash behaviour is, so that has priority.

Are you asking me to hide known problems under a rug? ;)
Will see if I can easily fix some of these.  In particular the
eat-your-data FIXME that can cause LogFS to not survive a crash.
