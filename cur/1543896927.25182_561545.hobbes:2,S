If you use schedule_work() to pass off work from interrupt context
to process context, then you wouldn't be calling down_trylock()
from interrupt context in the first place (which is what is being
discussed here). You would simply pass off the entire code that
uses the shared data (and wraps a *proper* down() or mutex_lock()
around it, not the _trylock() variant) to the workqueue.
Also, that is precisely my point too. What I'm saying is that it is
generally poor design to be wanting to use the _trylock() variant
of semaphore / mutex in interrupt context. Workqueues _are_ the
preferred mechanism to use for (most) such cases where you need
to do something that may require you to sleep.
