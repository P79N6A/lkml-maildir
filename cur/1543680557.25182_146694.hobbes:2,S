Won't this make undeletion a lot harder? Deleted inodes will now be trashed
at will, so you cannot use their contents anymore. 
Also dtimes in free inodes  can be now lost, can't they? Did you check 
if that causes problems in fsck?  [my understanding was that ext2/3 fsck relies on the 
dtime to make some heuristics when recovering files work better]
Maybe it should be an mount option so that users can trade performance against
better recoverability.
