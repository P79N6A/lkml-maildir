	My straightforward question: If code has called local_irq_disable, does
this guarantee that a bottom half handler cannot run?
	I'm looking for a statement on semantics. I've tried to hunt
documentation in many forms. None of them imply that disabling irqs
would also disable bottom halves. It might just be me, but I have a
strong sense that disabling interrupts is a stronger statement than
disabling bottom halves.
	However I don't want to trust my instincts for this. I am looking for a
clear statement on the Linux definitions. And I am not asking this
question just to satisfy some curiosity -- there is an underlying
problem I'm hoping to put to rest.
	Thanks!
