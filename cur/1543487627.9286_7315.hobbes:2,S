I thought about this way to workaround the Solaris bug infact. Maybe I
missed some bit of TCPRFC, but I thought it was not possible because once
Solairs didn't seen the FIN flag, it just interpreted the last octect of
the FIN-full-of-data packet as data while it was a virtual octect. Am I
wrong here?
