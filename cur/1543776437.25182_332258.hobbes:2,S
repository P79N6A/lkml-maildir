I wasn't aware anyone preferred defines to enums for declaring enumerated 
data types.  The practical advantages of enums are slight, but as far as I 
know, the practical advantages of defines are zero.  Isn't the only 
argument for defines, "that's what I'm used to."?
Two advantages of the enum declaration that haven't been mentioned yet, 
that help me significantly:
- if you have a typo in a define, it can be really hard to interpret the 
compiler error messages.  The same typo in an enum gets a pointed error 
message referring to the line that has the typo.
- Gcc warns you if a switch statement doesn't handle every case.  I often 
add an enumeration and Gcc lets me know where I forgot to consider it.
The macro language is one the most hated parts of the C language; it makes 
sense to try to avoid it as a general rule.
