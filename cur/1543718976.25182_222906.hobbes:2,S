hi,
i'm trying to run linux kernel 2.6.6 on hp itanium2 machine - zx6000,
which is running Redhat advanced server 2.1AW...
and i got some questions..
1. has anyone succeeded with the same condition?
2. nfs-utils currently installed is version 0.3.3. the minimum requirement
for 2.6.6 is 1.0.5, but i was told from the system management guy that
installing 1.0.5 might cause serious problems... is it true?
3. i got the link error when i build the kernel
bash-2.05$ make CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/gcc-3.3.3/usr/local/bin/
warning: your linker cannot handle cross-segment segment-relative
relocations.
         please upgrade to a newer version (it is safe to use this linker,
but
         the kernel will be bigger than strictly necessary).
make[1]: `arch/ia64/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
  CHK     include/asm-ia64/offsets.h
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  GEN     .version
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
/opt/gcc-3.3.3/usr/local/bin/ld: final link failed: File truncated
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
any idea?
thank you very much!
