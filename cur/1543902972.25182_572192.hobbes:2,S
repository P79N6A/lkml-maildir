With one explicit memcpy stripped out, I think it's more clear to
nbd_find_request.
In nbd_read_stat, the cast to (struct request **) is not apparent, I
must admit; but I think the best solution is declaring other few
structs to make it clear, it's due to the lack of description of nbd
client and server communication protocol.
BTW, I think the nbd driver needs a clear documentation (its main site
http://nbd.sourceforge.net/
 does not give it):
1. When nbd_find_request is needed to call, the 8 byte memory of char
handle[8] field in struct nbd_reply actually stores a pointer (struct
request *), that pointer is received from the network. Since a pointer
is only meaningful to the host, transfering it over the network will
be unreliable, I don't think it's a good design,
