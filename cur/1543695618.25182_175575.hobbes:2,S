Hello everybody
I wonder whether/how it is possible to use my Memory Stick Slot of my 
Sony Vaio PCG-Z600NE. lspci gives me 
00:0d.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: Sony Corporation Memory Stick 
Controller (rev 01)
I have seem a couple of posts for similar devices that seem to be 
connected to the USB bus. They suggest using the usb-storage module 
to talk to the device. This obviously does not work here as it is a 
PCI device.
Any ideas?
Thanks a lot, Thom
