was there a "NETDEV WATCHDOG" message that follows this?  If not it is
a harmless debug print.  Note the time_stamp and jiffies difference,
very large, consistent with a resume.  I think we need to disable the
internal e1000 tx hang code that causes this debug print when we are
suspending.  I'll work with auke to generate a short patch.
