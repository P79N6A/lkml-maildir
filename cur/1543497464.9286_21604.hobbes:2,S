That won't work in this case. It's also the wrong thing to do. If the link
is down you want packets to flow out of the device into oblivion.  Also
for some protocols its only by throwing packets down the pipe you find out.
Finally the sync protocols generate their own frames like keepalive for
the link state so setting dev->tbusy means it will never come back
