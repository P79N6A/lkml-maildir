How do I handle signals in kthreads? I looked at quite a few kthreads in 
the drivers sources, but couldn't
find even one example that has any explicit handling of signals.

I had some problems with that before (2.6.19 I think), but in 2.6.21-rc4 
it seems OK, so I will allow shared interrupts in my next version.

You are right. I missed that after refactoring the code before.

The problem is that if I use interrupts for mouse-like behavior, I have 
no way of knowing (unless I do some hacks to remember the last position 
and see if it changed more than
some threshold, or something like that - I'm not sure that at this point 
I can do that reliably)
what was the source of the interrupt - was that motion or free-fall 
event. This means I can't both use it as joystick and detect when
the laptop is falling. That's why I use the interrupts for free-fall 
events (as it was intended for this chip in the laptop context), and use 
polling for mouse like behavior. This is the same approach
as other accelerometer drivers in the kernel (hdaps and ams).
