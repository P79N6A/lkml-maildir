    Slightly echoing Jeff G's question, but rephrasing for read,
could you try a read on the actual device?  I.e. without
destroying your partition, you could try a direct read
from the device:
     time dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=1M count=8192.
BTW, how much memory do you have on the system?
    Not that I have know much about block-i/o, but it
might narrow things down.
    Have you tried the tests in single-user or run-level 1 to
help rule out other noise?
