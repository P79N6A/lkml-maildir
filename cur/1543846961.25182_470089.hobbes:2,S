The simplest way given the current GCC feature-set is:
   #ifdef HIDE_GCC_FALSE_POSITIVES
   # define correct_init(x) x = x
   #else
   # define correct_init(x) x
   #endif
Then:
   int correct_init(arg);
   struct some_struct correct_init(foo);
Alternatively if only some struct member has problems and the rest  
are OK:
   struct some_struct foo;
   correct_init(foo.bar);
