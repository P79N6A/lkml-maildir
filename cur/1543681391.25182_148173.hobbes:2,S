I have a Riva TNT2 display card. On compiling in framebuffer support and
 the other options (like the fonts, vga16 support, etc, relevant part of
 .config pasted below), the kernel doesn't proceed after some messages
 (where it initializes the frame buffer)... I just see the grub screen
 again with some stripes and there's no disk activity thereafter.
