I have a redhat 6.0 system with kernel package 2.2.5-22.  I am using
an old isa etherexpress card (which is loaded as a module).  I am
getting a lot of the above messages in my log file.  Everything seems
to be working fine, but eating a lot of log space.  I also saw a post
on deja.com from a guy using an "old isa ne2000 card." on mandrake 6.2 
with the same error message.  He was routing between two devices
(don't know what the second one was).  The point is that the other
device wasn't getting the error message.
