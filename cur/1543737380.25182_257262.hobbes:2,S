OK, I understand now. Both affected systems are running Slackware 9.1,
which may be a bit old (October 2003), but 2.6-ready, so I am using
bleeding edge 2.6 kernels, with no problems (well until a few days ago
;))

Well, I didn't enable any special option as far as I can remember, and
it works just fine :)
Thanks.
