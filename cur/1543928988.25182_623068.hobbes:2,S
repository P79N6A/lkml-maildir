Oh, tracing is expected to be on at all times?  I figured someone would
encounter a problem, then turn it on to dig down a little deeper, then
turn it off.
As for why I care what is in /proc/swaps.  Take a look at this:
struct swap_info_struct *
get_swap_info_struct(unsigned type)
{
        return &swap_info[type];
}
Then, look at the proc functions: 
static void *swap_next(struct seq_file *swap, void *v, loff_t *pos)
{
        struct swap_info_struct *ptr;
        struct swap_info_struct *endptr = swap_info + nr_swapfiles;
        if (v == SEQ_START_TOKEN)
                ptr = swap_info;
...
I guess if that swap_info[] has any holes, we can't relate indexes in
there right back to /proc/swaps, but maybe we should add some
information so that we _can_.
