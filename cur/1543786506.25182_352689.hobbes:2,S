Except that it actually does work, with Jen's patch.
Rather than sitting around for another six months hoping the problem
will go away (it won't), perhaps we should just update/merge Jen's
patch as a sorely needed interim fix.
This might then prod James et al into looking more at the SCSI side of
things, and some year we might see this get replaced with a better scheme.
This is a real problem, and an immediate solution is needed last spring.
Cheers
