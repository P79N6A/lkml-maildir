Subject: [patch 11/24] XFRM: Use output device disable_xfrm for forwarded packets
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

2.6.18-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: David Miller <davem@davemloft.net>
Currently the behaviour of disable_xfrm is inconsistent between
locally generated and forwarded packets. For locally generated
packets disable_xfrm disables the policy lookup if it is set on
the output device, for forwarded traffic however it looks at the
input device. This makes it impossible to disable xfrm on all
devices but a dummy device and use normal routing to direct
traffic to that device.
Always use the output device when checking disable_xfrm.
