Yeah, I have plans for a struct isa_dev in 2.7.  It seems we currently
have a few cases of drivers sharing pci_dev.

It occured to me that we also have the following related code in pci.h:
--- a/include/linux/pci.h       2004-01-09 06:59:33.000000000 +0000
+++ b/include/linux/pci.h       2004-02-10 17:51:08.000000000 +0000
@@ -362,8 +362,6 @@
 #define PCI_DMA_NONE           3
 #define DEVICE_COUNT_COMPATIBLE        4
-#define DEVICE_COUNT_IRQ       2
-#define DEVICE_COUNT_DMA       2
 #define DEVICE_COUNT_RESOURCE  12
 /*
Perhaps this should be removed as well?
A quick compile and cscope didn't reveal any dependencies but it's
difficult to be positive.
Thanks,
Adam
