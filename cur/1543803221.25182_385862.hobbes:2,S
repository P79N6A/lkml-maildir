I'm working against -mm, and there it's quite common that the kernel 
doesn't build on the majority of architectures due to one or two dozen 
bugs other people introduced.
I didn't know people consider the quality of my patches so under-average 
that they want to require me to fix other people's compile errors first 
and test the compilation on all 24 architectures before I'm allowed to 
submit a patch that touches some architecture-independend code.
