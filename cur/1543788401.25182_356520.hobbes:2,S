...and so the VFS can recognise the case, and be made to retry the
operation.
A more difficult race to deal with occurs if you allow a mount while
inside d_revalidate(). In that case NFS can end up opening the wrong
file.
Both these two races could, however, be fixed by moving the
__follow_mount() in open_namei() inside the section that is protected by
the parent directory i_sem.
In any case, all you are doing here is showing that the situation w.r.t.
mount races and lookup+create+open is difficult. I see nothing that
convinces me that a special atomic create+open will help to resolve
those races.
Nor do I see that adding a special atomic create+open will help me avoid
intents for the case of atomic lookup+open(). As far as I'm concerned,
the case of lookup+create+open is just a special case of lookup+open.
