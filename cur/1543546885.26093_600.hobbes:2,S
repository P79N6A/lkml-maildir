read() may succeed _before_ you close the dup()'d descriptor. You are
thinking about the case when the thing is never going to receive anything
_and_ kernel has no way to recognize that, right? (otherwise kernel should
just return 0 and be done with that). Now, look at the case where read()
_will_ eventually succeed (since we are in "no way to tell" area, we can't
exclude all these cases, right?) Look at the scenario above for that case.
You've got close(dup()) racing with read() and close(); in some cases you
get -EBADF, in some - data. And that race is going to be a hell to hunt
down.
Yes, programs may need a way to abort blocked IO. But overloading close()
is a *very* bad idea.

See above.
