Hello,
Is the kernel IP-Autoconfiguration broken in the late 2.2.x serie?     
I have three machines in a tiny network:
"dharma":	Linux 2.2.5, ISC DHCP
"cutter":	windows 95
"cryo":		Linux 2.2.7 (not the latest, but the most stable  ;o)
dharma is serving dhcp-/bootprequest on this network.    cryo is set to
obtain it's ip-config at boot-time.   Whenever cryo boots, it sends
bootp-requests.   But the requests eventually times out.    Looking in
the logs on dharma, I see:
Jul  2 23:25:57 dharma dhcpd: BOOTREQUEST from 00:a0:24:02:14:87 via
eth0
Jul  2 23:25:57 dharma dhcpd: BOOTREPLY for 10.1.1.2 to cryo
(00:a0:24:02:14:87)
 via eth0
Jul  2 23:26:02 dharma dhcpd: BOOTREQUEST from 00:a0:24:02:14:87 via
eth0
Jul  2 23:26:02 dharma dhcpd: BOOTREPLY for 10.1.1.2 to cryo
(00:a0:24:02:14:87)
 via eth0
Jul  2 23:26:10 dharma dhcpd: BOOTREQUEST from 00:a0:24:02:14:87 via
eth0
Jul  2 23:26:10 dharma dhcpd: BOOTREPLY for 10.1.1.2 to cryo
(00:a0:24:02:14:87)
 via eth0
... and so forth (10 times total - matches the number of times as set in
ipconfig.c).
The request arrives on dharma and is ack'ed ... so what is wrong?
(dhcp-request from cutter (win95) is ack'ed as well (on both machines):
Jul  2 23:33:36 dharma dhcpd: DHCPDISCOVER from 00:20:af:0f:4e:95 via
eth0
Jul  2 23:33:36 dharma dhcpd: DHCPOFFER on 10.1.1.3 to 00:20:af:0f:4e:95
via eth
0
Jul  2 23:33:36 dharma dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 10.1.1.3 from
00:20:af:0f:4e:95 vi
a eth0
Jul  2 23:33:36 dharma dhcpd: DHCPACK on 10.1.1.3 to 00:20:af:0f:4e:95
via eth0)
I added this line to /etc/lilo.conf:
	append = "ip=::::::bootp"
to force it to use the server-defaults.   (I _ran_ lilo afterwards  ;o)
I have also tried without the 'append' line, but with no luck.
So my question is simple:  what am I doing wrong?
Kind regards,
Brian
