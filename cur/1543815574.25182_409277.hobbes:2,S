OK.  Thanks for the contributions.

I think names of individuals would be preferred - the Signed-off-by: is
often used when hunting down maintainers/developers to bug about problems. 
Although as it's a single megapatch, that's less useful in this case.
If we go with the single signed-off-by: I guess it would be best if that
was a person within AD who is in a position to authorise the merge.  If you
say that person is yourself or Luke then fine.

readl/writel and friends would be the preferred way of accessing
memory-mapped registers.  If that doesn't work then at least you should
wrap the volatile cast into a single inlined function somewhere so it's not
splattered everywhere.  That way the code is more pleasing to read and we
eliminate the risk that someone forgets to add the cast.
