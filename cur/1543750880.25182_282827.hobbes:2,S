i've uploaded my port:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this is mainly a straight port from 2.6.10-rc3-mm1 to 2.6.10-mm1, plus i
picked up a post-2.6.10-mm1 audio-driver buildsystem fix-patch. Please
(re-)report any new or old regressions.
to create a -V0.7.34-00 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.10.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.10/2.6.10-mm1/2.6.10-mm1.bz2
