I found that it requires this patch to compile correctly for radeonfb,
lifted from another LKML message:

And even then it does not build. Requires this patch.

The kernel is still building, I will see what happens...
On 2.5.67-mm1 without the fbdev.diff, the computer would boot and not go
into fb mode at all. It would just hang there. So I'm trying this now.
Hope it works :)
