That isn't special to this driver though.  Maybe it should be fixed for
all serial drivers, since the situation you mention above is not limited
to just this driver.
As you say, you may have a modem connected, which may have been configured
to automatically dial a predetermined number when DTR is raised.
Maybe we need a solution which applies to all drivers?

Note that exporting statistics can be a security bug, especially if that
includes the number of bytes sent/received.  For an explaination of this,
please lookup the reason why the /proc/tty/driver directory was made
unreadable to userspace.
