Oops, sorry, I mis-read you
Well, if you have proper iops that swap for normal datas, then
you can use the "normal" fixup routines for control datas
like ident, the same we use on PPC or other BE archs.
The problem is typiucally the same for everybody here: the
swapping of datas themselves must be done so that you get an
exact image of the datas in memory, then you need additional
fixup to "interpret" some of these (ident, smart, ...)
