Hi,
Cisco's linux support is great until you have IBM's ThinkPad R40. With
this notebook, their newest Linux driver (version 2.0, older ones do not
support my card) module (mpi350.o) can't be inserted to kernel (oops and
module remains 'initializing' forever). Module is compiled successfully
against both 2.4.20 and 2.4.21-rc7 kernels.
I'm just fighting their bureaucracy (in support) and trying to reach
someone who actually wrote the driver (module says Roland Wilcher). I
want to help him with testing and provide him with all possible
information.
My other chance is to get working new driver from
http://airo-linux.sf.net
, but there is no activity in last several
weeks.
