Hello everyone,
I am trying to overwrite the e_entry on an executable's elf header and
change the flow of control with the following piece of code :
               Elf32_Ehdr *self = (Elf32_Ehdr *)0x8048000;
               printf("%x",(self)->e_entry);
               (self)->e_entry = (Elf32_Addr)0x00000000;
This piece of code is present in a pre loaaded shared library.
But the problem is that even after changing the address of the
e_entry, the actual main function of the executable a.out is getting
executed. BUt if the address of this e_entry is getting changed then
how the control is finally reaching _lib_start_main and finally to
main().
I tried overwriting it with 0x0000000 still it worked.
The command given for execution is :
#LD_PRELOAD="./lib1.so" ./a.out
Where does the loader takes the address of _start before passing
control to it ?
please help !
