nopage() is only called when the page is not mapped for the current
process.  So it doesn't get called very often.  Easy enough to call
virt_to_page at alloc instead of nopage time, though.  Patch attached :)

Actually, I wonder if its even possible for mmap_kiobuf to support audio
-- full duplex requires that both record and playback buffer(s),
theoretically two separate sets of kiobufs, to be presented as one space
(with playback always presented before record).  Even if you can do that
with mmap_kiobuf, some audio hardware doesn't support scatter-gather, so
each set of kiobufs must be physically contiguous for each channel.
<thinks>  audio drivers' write(2) should be kiobuf'd, but only for
hardware which supports scatter-gather.
I can't think of any other cases where kiobuf would apply to audio.
