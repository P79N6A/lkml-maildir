My idea of "Easing into things" is dropping the full model in the guy's
face and saying "Here, this is what we want to do.  It's there, you
don't have to use it, but you should be mindful because it's better and
in the future people will want it."  Then people will wait to turn it on
until everything is written to work with it--and every developer will
see it and know that that is there and that certain things need to be done.
You don't have to beat them with a crowbar until they listen, but you
have to show them what they're supposed to do.
