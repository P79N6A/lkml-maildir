Whether it uses the input api or the existing scheme doesn't matter to me.
What's important is that the interrupt disables and udelay()'s are
removed, so I'll gladly merge my work with whatever else people have
prepared.  I would've done it sooner, but changing the keyboard driver is
an area of compatibility with sufficiently many hazzards that it's not
reasonable for 2.4.
