Jean, which is why he submitted the patch.
You, implicitly, by acking a patch saying those parens are bad.
But not me ... I don't think this patch is merge-worthy.

Evidently not, since removing it would promote such bloat.
Explicitly removing disapproval is a form of approval...

So the reason to remove that guideline, and thereby encourage
proliferation of needless parens, is ... that some OTHER way
to get rid of them is working?
I would agree that line could be improved to say that messages
should not be needlessly large.  Excess parens are one example;
wordiness is another (including printing 8 bit fields as 0x%08x),
and I'm sure there are more.
