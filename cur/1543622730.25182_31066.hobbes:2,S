Lookup is cheap. I integrated a <hit meter> into my hashing mechanism
that reports the hits/misses and the average length of traversal down
a hash chain, it's insignificant for the cases I tried, but again
no big progam has be tried against any of these approaches.
I (think) I now also see the merit of your approach, in that you really don't
need to allocate a kernel object. You actually allocate the object
right into the shared user page and pin it down. Your argument is that
you only need to pin while somebody is sleeping on the lock.
Is that correct? Very tricky. 
Let me also point out some shortcomings of this. If indeed there is a 
shared page between user and kernel then how does the system react to 
buggy userlevel code, e.g wild write that corrupt the wait queue.
In my explicite kernel object approach, I won't have this problem.
I hope I am not missing something here.
