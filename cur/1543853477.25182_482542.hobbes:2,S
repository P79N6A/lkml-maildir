I doubt if that's causing the problem. My reasons are:
- Reuben's config shows his system to be a x64_64. So if I am not
  mistaken, the correct file look for would be 
  arch/ia64/kernel/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c.
- The fix provided by you deals with the state of a 
  driver(hardware) specific variable data->cpu_feature while the
  governors like userspace/performance/powersave/ondemand are 
  driver(hardware) independent.
Nevertheless, it could be a valid fix for i386 acpi_cpufreq considering
that policy->cur is not being initialized if 
data->cpu_feature == ACPI_ADR_SPACE_FIXED_HARDWARE.
Please check with Dave Jones or Venkatesh Pallipadi.
Thanks
