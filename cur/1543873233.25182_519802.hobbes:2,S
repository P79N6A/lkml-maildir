80x86
8086
ia32   <- I'd go with this for lack of more entries on this list.
i486
i86pc  <- Solely listed for completes. No Solarisisms in Linux please :p
ix86
x32    <- Blame Microsoft for introducing "x64"
x86_32 <- Will interfere with your tabbing.

with

and
	#include "ia32/......./foo.h"
a bit nicer IMO, but may not work as intended.
