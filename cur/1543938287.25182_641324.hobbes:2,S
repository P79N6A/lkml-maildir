I suspected that was the case, but for all I knew there was some
religious objection.  But in any case, there'd be little point in
fixing that if the more significant issue can't get resolved.

... that one's the real dirty bit of this example patch; having
multiple levels of IRQ chaining is quite realistic.

What, like an example of such a bogus warning?  See below.
First set_irq_wake() call owns child's lock; bogus warning
issued when getting parent's lock.
This is on AT91, but ISTR seeing similar warnings (different
drivers of course) on OMAP too.

---------------------------------------------
sh/474 is trying to acquire lock:
 (&irq_desc_lock_class){++..}, at: [<c005ca90>] set_irq_wake+0x34/0xfc
but task is already holding lock:
 (&irq_desc_lock_class){++..}, at: [<c005ca90>] set_irq_wake+0x34/0xfc
other info that might help us debug this:
