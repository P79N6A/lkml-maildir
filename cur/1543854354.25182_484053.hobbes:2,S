That's completely correct, hence my somewhat relaxed approach with SRCU.

If we consider the barrier a barrier in a certain stream of requests,
it is the responsibility of the issuer of that barrier to ensure that
the queueing is ordered. So if two "unrelated" streams of requests with
barriers hit __make_request() at the same time, we don't go to great
lengths to ensure who gets there firt.

3 is the closest. The request queue doesn't really know the scope of the
barrier, it has to rely on the issuer getting it right. If you have two
competing processes issuing io and process A relies on process B issuing
a barrier, they have to synchronize that between them. Normally that is
not a problem, since that's how the file systems always did io before
barriers on items that need to be on disk (it was a serialization point
anyway, it's just a stronger one now).
That said, I think the
        smp_mb();
        if (srcu_readers_active(sp))
                synchronize_srcu();
makes the most sense.
