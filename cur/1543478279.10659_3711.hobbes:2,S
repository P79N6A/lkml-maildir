(I tried posting this from my own account, but my DNS is screwed, and I
can't fix it due to it being hosted somewhere out of my control) 
VesaFB in 2.2.0-preX only detects 4mb of ram on my graphics card, after
contacting the guy who wrote the fb howto, he said it was a bug and to let
you lot know .. I have a Riva TNT AGP if it makes a difference, and I can
post kernel message to anyone who needs them
