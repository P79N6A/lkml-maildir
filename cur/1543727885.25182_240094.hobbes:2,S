In case you don't know what DMA abstraction is:
DMA abstraction includes everything that is going to be done to set up
DMA after the buffer address and the size is known.
If you were true and Linux would include _and_ use DMA abstraction, then
we would have DMA with ide-scsi for all CD sector sizes.

Interesting: tell us more about how Linux handles kernel user interfaces by 
using a device special file instead of including the same include file 
in the kernel code as well as in the applicatin code?

YOu have only shown that you in many caes try to ignoore the truth ;-(

Listen arrogant little man: I have enough to to with writing free software.
I report bugs and if you are the author, you fix your bugs or I need to tell
the users of your software that you are unwilling to maintain your software.
