On a PowerBook (PowerBook5.4), when snd_powermac is modprobed during
the boot, I get the following.  After similar messages for a few more
modules, the machine seems wedged.
Reversed bk-driver-core.patch and rebuilt, same result.
kobject_register failed for snd_page_alloc (-17)
Call Trace:
  dump_stack
  kobject_register
  mod_sysfs_setup
  load_module
  sys_init_module
  ret_from_syscall
