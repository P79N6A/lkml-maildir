The goal of the drivers/scsi/pata_* drivers is to replace drivers/ide in
its entirity with code using the newer and cleaner libata logic. There
is still much to do but my SIL680, SiS, Intel MPIIX, AMD and VIA boxes
are using libata and the additional patch patches still queued.

It works in the -mm tree.

Or use labels. As you move into the world of hot pluggable hardware it
becomes more and more impractical to guarantee drive ordering by name.
You can mix and match the drivers providing you don't try and load both
libata and old ide drives for the same chip. Even then it should fail
correctly with one of them reporting resources unavailable.
In fact I do this all the time when debugging so I've got a stable disk
for debug work and a devel disk.
