Subject: [PATCH] driver core: check bus->match without holding device lock(v2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/21/213

From: Ming Lei <tom.leiming@gmail.com>
This patch moves bus->match out from driver_probe_device and
does not hold device lock to check the match between a device
and a driver.
The idea has been verified by the commit 6cd495860901,
which leads to a faster boot. But the commit 6cd495860901 has
the following drawbacks: 1),only does the quick check in
the path of __driver_attach->driver_probe_device, not in other
paths; 2),for a matched device and driver, check the same match
twice. It is a waste of cpu ,especially for some drivers with long
device id table (eg. usb-storage driver).
This patch adds a helper of driver_match_device to check the match
in all paths, and testes the match only once.
