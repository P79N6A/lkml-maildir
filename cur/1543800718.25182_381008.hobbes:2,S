We should split HID in two parts - transport and decoding. This would
help in many places:
	Bluetooth would be happy, because it uses the same HID protocol
	on top of a different transport layer (completely non-USB).
	Wacom and many other blacklisted devices would be happy, because
	they could use the USB HID transport - no blacklist would be
	needed.
	Would allow for /dev/usb/rawhid0 style devices, which would give
	access to raw HID reports without any parsing done.
	Would allow userspace drivers for broken UPS devices (like APC)
	without the need for special handling of their bugs in the kernel.
It seems to me it could be almost its own layer, like serio or gameport.
Windows has an API like that.
I don't have the time to do the split myself, but it shouldn't be too
hard.
It would not be the perfect solution for Apple keyboards, because the
patch is simplifies by doing the processing after parsing the reports,
but still, since it would allow for device-specific parsers, it'd be a
reasonable solution for devices that need more special handling than
just a simple quirk.
