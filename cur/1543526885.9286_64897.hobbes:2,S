I fear this problem, or another one, extends to non SMP boxes.  I have been
seeing many crashes lately.  They seem to occur when ppp0 is connected to 
my ISP via pppoe (using the patch from 
http://www.davin.ottawa.on.ca/pppoe/
 ) 
and ppp1 is connected via dialup (/dev/ttyS2).  The usually symptom is the having 
the box reboot without warning...  When it recovers there is nothing of interest 
in the logs.  Would love to know how to help debug this one.
I am using 2.2.15pre9 on an up-to-date debian potato system.
