You don't want your counters going backward. Full stop. If a program
can reset your counter, your application will never know, if it was a
legal, correct, valid reason or just a hacker trying to hide his
traces. At least provide some sort of lock-down.

Bad thing. If you want to use the rules in a security sensitive
environment, don't allow removal. If you need to, reset the whole
module and notify the user. Better, shut down the filter and yell for
help.
ipfilter is about security, isn't it?

There is no "more difficult", just "different ways". If you bother to
use a filtering environment where the filter counters tell e.g. "we
rejected xxx attacks", you don't want anyone to mess with these
counters. If this is a counter for a filtering rule, don't allow the
rule (and its counters) to be removed. Inactivate the rule but keep
the evidence (counter settings) around till module removal or reboot.
Sorry, I may be anal about security but as more and more people start
thinking "why should I bother with FW-1 or PIX when I can get a $99
Linux box and hack some filters", at least I want the $99 software
trying not to be sloppy about security.
