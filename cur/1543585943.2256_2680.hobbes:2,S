 Hi!
 Sorry for the "private" message... I'm testing some machines
 (real and virtual) under 2.4.3pre8, that have a AMD PCNET32
 ethernet driver. This cards works PERFECTLY under 2.2.x, but if
 I compile 2.4.x, I get a error on pcnet32.c about a function 
 not defined: is_valid_etherdevice(). 
 It seems that you all have changed lots of networking functions
 on the 2.2 to 2.4 change, but this driver still continues using
 the old functions.
 If i just comment the call to is_valid_etherdevice() (I'll
 assume the kernel passes a good etherdevice to pcnet32.c :-)
 the system hangs during boot when loading the pcnet32 module.
 If you need more info about this, ask me at this email.
 Thanks a lot for any help.
