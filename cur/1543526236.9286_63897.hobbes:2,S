	question: why there has to be asked a specific user ??? couldn't it
be just 
	an instance like a deamon an application can register with or even
just a 
	file in /proc which keeps the information about "open" floppies and 
	notifications? so any application (e.g. a gui like gnome/kde or a
shell) 
	can use it or just ignore it. and it could be configured to do so or
not.
	if a disk is full instead of not available, you have to create an
information too,
	and an application can ignore it...
