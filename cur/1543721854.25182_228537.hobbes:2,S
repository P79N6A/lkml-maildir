The problem is the memory fragmentation. The code i am
writing is for the memory defragmentation as proposed
by Daniel Phillips, my project partner Alok mooley has
given mailed a simple prototype in the mid of feb.

The pages in the LRU list are selected. As these pages
can be swapped they can moved to another location in
the memory.

Isnt it a bad idea to take the BKL, the performance of
SMP systems will drastically be hampered.

The way we work is as follows
Initially a block is selected which can be moved i.e
pages on lru or free and the pages are moved to a
suitable free pages. The main problem arises during
the copying and updation process. All the ptes are to
updates. a method similar to try_to_unmap_one  is used
to identify the ptes and the physical address is
updated.
Maintaining atomicity in uniprocessor systems is easy
by preempt_enable and preempt_disable during the
operation. This implementation cannot be used for SMP
systems. 
Now during the time a page is copied/updatede if a
page is accessed the copied contents become invalid,
as updation is not done. Also during updation a
similar situation might arise.
The problem we are facing is to maintain the atomicity
of this operation on SMP boxes.
