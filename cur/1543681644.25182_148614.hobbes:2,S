Are you using the correct eventX device node? Look at
/proc/bus/input/devices to make sure. Verify from the console that you
get data from the device. Type
        cat /dev/input/eventX | od -x
access the touchpad and verify that some data is produced.
Your XF86Config file should have a section that looks something like
this:
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"TouchPad"
	Driver	"synaptics"
	Option	"Device"	"/dev/input/event3"
	Option	"Protocol"	"event"
	Option	"SHMConfig"	"on"
EndSection
P.S. Auto-detection of the correct eventX device is under
construction, so pretty soon it will be much easier to set things up.
