Yes, it seems that modifying do_mlock() to something like
	int do_mlock(unsigned long start, size_t len,
		     unsigned int set, unsigned int clear)
and then exporting a function along the lines of
	int do_mem_pin(unsigned long start, size_t len, int on)
that sets/clears (VM_LOCKED_KERNEL | VM_DONTCOPY) according to the on
flag.
Seem reasonable?  If so I can code this up.
