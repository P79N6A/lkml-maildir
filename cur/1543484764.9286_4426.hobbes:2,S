I know there is not, so don't worry.

There is no address space for DMA-Busmaster.
Since you have this crazy animal, please try calling pci=reverse,
this suggestion is because your IDE chipset is setup last be cause of the
device numbering.  There may be a chance that if your pci currently is
allowing another device to claim the io-space and thus a disable.
This is very unlikely, but painless and worth a try.
Would you send a copy of the pci-config space for review.
Just by chance can you run the machine under MSDOS and get the
DMA-busmastering functionall?  If you can do this, I will send you a tool
to report the config space of all devices and then take stab at a
workaround.
