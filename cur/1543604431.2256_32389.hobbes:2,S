Absolutely. Even reader-writer locks with read-mostly situations
can result in painful degradation because of the dirty cacheline
bouncing around.

I think it depends on the lockless algorithm. If it requires you
to write to cachelines with same level of sharing as earlier
locking algorithm, it is no good. On the other hand, if you
use schemes that minimizes or ideally has no writes to shared 
data for maintaining readers, it should result in performance gains.

I would agree to the extent that lockless algorithms cannot be used as 
a wholesale replacement for spin-waiting locks. However in key areas where
performance is critical, lockless techniques can be applied provided
they don't come with the same problems as locking.
I would point to Read-Copy Update as a lockless mutual exclusion
where you don't have to maintain global reader counts and other
shared cachelines. We have been experimenting with a few
places in the linux kernel where lookups can be speeded up
by not having any writes to shared cachelines.
