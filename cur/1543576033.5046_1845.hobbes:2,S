mmh... but this is no real problem, because the ipchains and ipfwadm
backwards compat modules are mutually exclusive.

mmh.. but the ip_fw_compat layer without one of [ipchains, ipfwadm] doesn't
make sense at all. And ip_fw_compat is never going to be used more than once
because of the exclusiveness i've described above.

a patch for the 'true library' solution.
