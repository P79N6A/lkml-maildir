Can you narrow down the -gitX release further?  i.e. does 2.6.20-git13 
perform at full speed?  -git13 includes several libata changes, but does 
not include the ACPI additions.
Since this is an ACPI execution error in the bug, that would tend to 
point to bad BIOS tables.  But since there is a performance drop that 
does not disappear with acpi=off, there might also be another factor, 
unrelated to ACPI, at play here.
