Am I even close in assuming that to enable the PI support you have to use
pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(mutexattr, PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT);
I have only glibc 2.3 and 2.4 and neither of them understand what
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT is.
Can anyone point me to an some Doc or examples of how to enable PI for
pthread_mutexes?
Sorry I'm ignorant on the subject. I do understand the principle of PI and may
even be able to figure out how to test it in user land but how do I turn it on?
Thanks
Mark
