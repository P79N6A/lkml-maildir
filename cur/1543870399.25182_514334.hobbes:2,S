the ab numbers below do not seem that impressive to me, especially for such 
stripped down server processes.
here are some numbers from a set of test boxes I've got in my lab. I've been 
useing them to test firewalls, and I've been getting throughput similar to what 
is listed below when going through a proxy that does a full fork for each 
connection, and then makes a new connection to the webserver on the other side! 
the first few sets of numbers are going directly from test client to test 
server, the final set is going though the proxy.
client and server are dual opteron 252 with 8G of ram, running debian in 64 bit 
mode
this is with apache2 MPM as the destination (relativly untuned except for 
tinkering with the child count settings). this should be about as bad as you can 
get for a server

for both of these tests the server had it's cpu maxed out (<5% idle)
switching to thttpd instead of apache and I get

for these the CPU is ~45% idle on the server box.
now if I go through a box in the middle running a proxy that forks for every 
request (so you have two seperate TCP connections, plus a fork for each 
request plus two writes to syslog) the proxy box is a dual opteron 252 with 4G 
or ram running debian 32 bit
