Do you have radeon hardware? Is there any oops in your logs?
It definitely sounds like it's due to this one:
	ChangeSet@1.1988.69.186, 2004-10-19 08:09:17-07:00, benh@kernel.crashing.org
	  [PATCH] rework radeonfb blanking
	  This patch cleans up some old cruft in the manipulation of the LVDS
	  interface registers and fixes the blanking code to work with various DVI
	  flat panels.
	  Since this is all very sensitive stuff, I'm posting the patch here for
	  testing before submitting it upstream, though Andrew is welcome to put it
	  in -mm.
	  It also fix some problems with getting the right PLL setup on recent Mac
	  laptops, replacing the old hard coded list of values with cleaner code that
	  "probes" the PLL setup done by the firmware.
