Subject: [BK PATCH] i2c driver changes for 2.5.66
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Here are some i2c driver changes for 2.5.66.  These include changes that
I previously sent, but didn't end up in 2.5.65.
They do the following:
	- hook up i2c devices with the driver core.
	- remove some redundant fields from i2c structures now that the
	  driver and device structures are being used.
	- fix up i2c drivers outside of the i2c tree.
	- fix some other minor bugs.
The i2c bus, drivers, and devices are now all hooked up to the driver
core.  On one of my boxes this looks like:
/sys/bus/i2c/
|-- devices
|   `-- i2c_dev_0 -> ../../../devices/pci0/00:1f.3/i2c-0/i2c_dev_0
`-- drivers
    `-- LM75 sensor
        `-- i2c_dev_0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0/00:1f.3/i2c-0/i2c_dev_0
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/i2c-2.5
thanks,
