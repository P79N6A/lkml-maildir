Hello,
everything works as expected, but ...
closing X and no capabilities set for xinit does shutdown only the
windowmanager and not the X server (Xorg server 1.4)
Consolemessage is:
xinit:  Operation not permitted (errno 1): Can't kill X server
the xattr capability is removed, when the file is chown'ed.
