After reading a bunch of the posts about people having problems with the
AIC7xxx driver in the latest 2.0 kernels, I decided to upgrade from 2.0.32
and see for myself.  For the most part, the system works ok, but I can
easilly make it lock up hard.
My test is to simply copy a large file from one drive to another.  It will
copy for about two seconds, then lock.
I moved the 2.0.32 driver forward to 2.0.37-pre9 and everything works fine.
I can do severy copies at a time and not have a lock.
My system is a dual P5-133 with an Adaptec 3940.  Add drivers are on
controller 0.
