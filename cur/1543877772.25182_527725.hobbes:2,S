Check the motherboard manual.  Sometimes they explictly list which slots
share IRQs (And by share I mean are physically tied to the same wire).
I know many Asus boards have that information in the manual.
So in many cases other than changing slots, there is nothing you can do
to change the IRQ sharing, since the slots are physically sharing the
interrupt.
