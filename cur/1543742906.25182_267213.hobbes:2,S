i tested with 100kb, 200kb and 400kb (which takes long, but not too long to 
wait) and i wonder if time actually grows linear with bigger files, or if 
it's eaven worse.
reading is at ca. 500kb/sec
btw - i compared several kernel versions in the meantime.
2.6.8 doesn't show the issue, 2.6.9-rc2 up to 2.6.9 does...
