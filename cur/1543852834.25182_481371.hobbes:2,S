No idea - I don't have that sort of information.  Those which are PCI
based have the potential to use it if some userspace programmer wants
to use the ioperm/inb/outb etc which glibc provides.
I have had the occasional bug report that these functions haven't
worked when we haven't been exporting the right info via sysctl, so
they do seem to get used.
