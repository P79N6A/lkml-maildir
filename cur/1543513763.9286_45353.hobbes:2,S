I know about that problem, but didn't need to solve it yet.  It is an
incorrect operation, however my patch simply makes sure that if interface B
doesn't want to ARP that interface A won't respond with ARP's for it.
If I was sure that noone ever wants the cross-ARPing that is happening now I
would prevent that also.  It certainly screws up benchmarks and multi-adapter
parallelism.
I'll think about releasing a separate patch for that however I expect that the
developers working more often on the ARP and networking code will fix the real
problem.  I'm not sure I will have the time to fix the code correctly.
Thanks
