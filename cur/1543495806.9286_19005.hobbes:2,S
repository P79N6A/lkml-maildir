You don't care to run update always with the same delta-time between
different runs. update does "sync some old buffer to disk". If you'll
delay the call of sync_old_buffers() then as worse the next time you'll
sync to disk some more dirty buffer.
The stability of the VM system is enforced by bdflush/kswapd and not
from uptime.

If you need filesystem integrity after a crash (or better after a power
fail... ;), then you need a fault toulerant fs and not ext2. update
can't save you, it can only alleviate the damage.

You sometime force mark_dirty_buffers() to wait all dirty
buffers to be flushed away before allowing it to go ahead.

Think if bdflush was writing the last bdflush_param.ndirty buffer. You'll
issue a sleep_on() but you'll get a wakeup without waiting that some more
buffer is been synced back to disk. And my way will avoid many task switch
ping-pong.

Please let me see the numbers of 2.2.8_andrea1.bz2 doing the same on the
same heardware, I would be interested.
