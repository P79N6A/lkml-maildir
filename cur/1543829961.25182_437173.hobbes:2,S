I don't have any of the hardware. I was just doing some work on
Kconfig and noticed that a bunch of drivers had gone missing. I see
now that a lot of the drivers in media/video have the same problem. I
guess V4L1 is going to be with us for a while longer since all of
these drivers need to get ported.
