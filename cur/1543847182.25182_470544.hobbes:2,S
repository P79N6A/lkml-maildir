Well I was using mapping_gfp_mask(mapping) as the argument to
try_to_release_page() which also worked... but isn't this
just plugging one of many holes? Meaning try_to_release_page is called
from a number of places with a zero gfp_mask so shouldn't those
also be fixed as well OR removed the gfp_mask as an argument as the
comment at the top of try_to_release_page() alludes to?
