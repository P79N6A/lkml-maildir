When an interrupt arrives and linux finds no driver on that IRQ
willing to claim it, "irqpoll" causes Linux to search other IRQs
to find some other device driver that is looking for an interrupt.
So if the problem is that a device is provoking interrupts on the
wrong IRQ, you will not see the "nobody cared" message when
"irqpoll" is used.

No.  irqpoll is silent.
