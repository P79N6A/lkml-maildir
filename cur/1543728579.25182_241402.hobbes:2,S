Maybe not that complex. The "suspend image" has become the running 
kernel by the time we receive the resume request, right? So we maybe 
just look at the dma base address that we already have in our 
card-private data structure. If that's all that's needed the S3-resume 
is more likely to just work for disk suspend.
But in general yes you are right you need to separate the bootup code 
into "allocate structures" and "program the card for those locations" 
sections. Personally I think this approach can ultimately be more 
maintainable than saving and restoring registers.

Look at my aic7xxx patch. Maybe a little messy but it works. Eh it kind 
of uses a mix of a save/restore registers technique (inherited from 
Justin Gibbs' code) and my own "reuse-the-boot-code" approach that I 
needed to fill in the gaps in his resume code, which was untested
