This particular piece of hardware is a Dell Inspiron 7000 laptop.

This makes unfortunately absolutely no difference. 
Opening the psaux device causes the keyboard lockup and no interrupts are 
beeing received by the psaux device. Closing the device also unlocks the 
keyboard. 
The only test that so far had any impact was the suggestion to 
disable the toshiba workaround. With the workaround enabled I get the
"Timeout - AT keyboard not present ?" warning after starting gpm. 
If it is disabled, I do not hit this code path.
