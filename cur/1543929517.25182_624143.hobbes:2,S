Yes, since current behavior on network irq is very pessimistic.
If you have some trafic, (ie more than HZ/2  interrupts per second), 
then add_timer_randomness() feeds
 some entropy but gives no credit (calling credit_entropy_store() with 
nbits=0)
This is because we take into account only the jiffies difference, and 
not the get_cycles() that should give
 us more entropy on most plaforms.
In this patch, I suggest that we feed only one u32 word of entropy, 
combination of the previous distinct
words (with some of them being constant or so), so that the nbits 
estimation is less pessimistic, but also to
avoid injecting false entropy.
