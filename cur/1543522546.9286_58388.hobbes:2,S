Hello all,
there was a suggestion posted to l-k a while ago about how to keep ALL
output from printk(), so that you get consistent data in syslog.  The
note was in respect to capturing OOPS information correctly, but there
is a lot of "oops" in the l-k archives, so searching is difficult.
It was on the order of a couple of lines patch to the kernel.
I'm writing a module, and I need to be able to track debugging info from
printk, but it drops out occasionally when there is lots of output, and
makes it hard to follow the flow of execution.
Any help is appreciated.
Cheers, Andreas
