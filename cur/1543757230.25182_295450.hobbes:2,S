Ok, how about this then?  It changes the printks in both drivers to KERN_INFO 
and describes the situation a bit more accurately.

Thanks,

P.S. Jon, I think the pci_map_rom code is buggy--if the option ROM signature 
is missing or indicates that there's no ROM, the routine still returns a 
valid pointer making the caller thing it succeeded.  If we fix that up we can 
fix up the callers.
