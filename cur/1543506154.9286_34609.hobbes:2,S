ok here is the problem.  we have a couple servers where we cannot use
make menuconfig.
the error is about not finding ncurses.h.
i have tried to copy the entire lxdialog directory from another machine,
different kernal so no go, but i did get an error message with these
email addresses.
so, basically there is no ncurses.h  installed on theses servers.  i
checked /usr/include/ and nothing there.
so where did we go wrong on the install,  did we exclude something
important and how do i get some of them ncurses?
any help would be appreciated.
Thanks
