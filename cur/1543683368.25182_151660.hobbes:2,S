It was not renamed, it just requires that LLC be selected first, then one has
to select IPX as before.
I plan to make the LLC1 part, that is all that is needed for IPX, Appletalk and
Token Ring to be separated from the big llc module, and making those depending
only on LLC1 to be top level in the config, triggering the selection of LLC1
automatically, this will help as well on not having to have LLC2 when all one
wants is IPX, Appletalk or Token Ring.
