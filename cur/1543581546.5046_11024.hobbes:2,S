Hello,
In the event of a power outtage, my servers all shutdown -h when the 
backup UPS gets low, and I have them configured to start back up with a 
router (that uses an AT mobo, so it will start automatically) to send 
wakeonlan packets to my other servers to start them back up. Wakeonlan 
works if i were to hit the power before Linux starts, so I know I have 
it configured properly, and I also have wakeonlan turned on in the BIOS. 
However, when I do shutdown -h, it will turn the power off, but 
wakeonlan does not work. Ive tried enabling ACPI and tinkering with 
options in the BIOS, but i cant power up with WOL after issuing shutdown -h.
Im using an Abit KT7 motherboard, which uses the Via Apollo KT133 chipset.
Any ideas/suggestions will be greatly appreciated.
