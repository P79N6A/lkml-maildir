Is .notes an allocated section?  I didn't think it necessarily appeared 
in any of the PT_LOAD segments, because the linux/elfnote.h macros don't 
necessarily set "a" on the section.
I have a patch to always do this, and also convert all the note 
generation to C code rather than asm.  If your patch works for you, 
however, it should be completely orthogonal.
