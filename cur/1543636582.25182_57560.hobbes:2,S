I've reorganized the list into 5 categories based on the feedback 
I received.  Now let's see what happens  :-)
In line with your expectations?
-- Guillaume
----------------------------------------------------
Likely to be merged before feature freeze:
  o New VM with reverse mappings
  o Add Linux Security Module (LSM)
  o New MTRR (Memory Type Range Register) driver
  o Add support for CPU clock/voltage scaling
  o Add User-Mode Linux (UML)
  o Direct pagecache <-> BIO disk I/O
  o Fix device naming issues
  o Remove the 2TB block device limit 
----------------------------------------------------
"The pressure is on! (TM)":
(either gets merged before feature freeze or has to wait till 2.7)
  o Rewrite of the console layer                    
  o XFS (A journaling filesystem from SGI)
  o LVM (Logical Volume Manager) v2.0
  o Zerocopy NFS
  o Asynchronous IO (aio) support
  o New kernel build system (kbuild 2.5)
  o Serial driver restructure                       
  o Replace initrd by initramfs
  o ext2/ext3 large directory support: HTree index
----------------------------------------------------
Can be merged after the feature freeze and before the 2.6 release:
  o Strict address space accounting                 
  o More complete NetBEUI stack                     
  o Add hardware sensors drivers                    
  o PCMCIA Zoom video support               
  o Change all drivers to new driver model
  o UDF Write support for CD-R/RW (packet writing)
  o USB gadget support
----------------------------------------------------
Would be nice to have before feature freeze, but most likely 2.7:
  o Improved i2o (Intelligent Input/Ouput) layer
  o Read-Copy Update Mutual Exclusion
  o New IO scheduler
  o Per-mountpoint read-only, union-mounts, unionfs
  o EVMS (Enterprise Volume Management System)
  o Dynamic Probes
  o Page table sharing
  o ext2/ext3 online resize support
  o Better event logging for enterprise systems
  o UMSDOS (Unix under MS-DOS) Rewrite
  o Scalable Statistics Counter
  o Linux Kernel Crash Dumps
  o SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol)
  o High resolution timers
  o Overhaul PCMCIA support
  o Reiserfs v4
  o New lightweight library (klibc)
  o New mount API
  o Generic parameter/command line interface
  o Full compliance with IPv6
  o Serial ATA support      
  o Add support for NFS v4
----------------------------------------------------
Definitely 2.7:
o InfiniBand support
o Add thrashing control
o Remove all hardwired drivers from kernel
