OK!!

Yes, both machines that I use are SCSI, one is a P70 
with a IBM MCA SCSI Adapter with 256K Cache, and the 
other is a Model 77 486/66 with Intergrated SCSI.  The 
P70 has a single 1Gig Conner driver, and the 77 has a 
500 Meg IBM drive, an IBM 2x CDROM, and a 1Gig Conner 
drive.
2.3.18 boots on both systems.  I have booted 2.3.23, 25, 
and 26 on the Model 77 (haven't tried them on the P70) 
and they all boot to a login but have terribly slow 
performance with the VM eventually killing off 
everything.  Maybe we have a very bad memory leak.
With 2.3.27,28 the machine won't even boot the kernel.  
It says, Uncompressing Linux...OK, now booting the 
kernel, and that's it.
Since I know 2.3.26 works and 2.3.27 doesn't I'll see if 
I can determine exactly what change kille
