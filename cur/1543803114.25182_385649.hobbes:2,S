You can easily distinguish them by the device instance name, we have this
in a lot of other classes too: /class/sound/controlC0 is very different from
/class/sound/pcmC0D0p, /class/sound/timer, ...

You can, if you want separate classes, put them in different classes.
This will work fine with this model now, cause the device hierarchy is
still nicely exposed in /sys/devices.
