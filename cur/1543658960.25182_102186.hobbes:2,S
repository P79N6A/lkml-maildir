There are two clues here that are interesting...
First, I am worried about the APIC bits.  Can you try (a) compiling a
kernel without local APIC, and (b) boot with "noapic" on the kernel
command line [set in lilo/grub]?
Second, the Conexant LANfinity is tough for me to find, as it only
exists on laptops AFAIK, and I don't have access.  It is poorly
supported in the current kernel tulip driver.  I was recently given
access to documentation (finally!), so maybe we can resolve some of
these tulip issues too, if you are willing.  But first, tackle the
interrupt delivery problem.  Interrupt delivery is quite often a source
of bogus nic driver bug reports, unfortunatley.

P.S. Anyone with a source of Compaq Laptop 1400 laptops, or laptops with
a LANfinity NIC on them, please contact me off-list....
