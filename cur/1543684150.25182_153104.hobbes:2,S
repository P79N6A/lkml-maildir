Subject: Question about 2.4 kernel clone() system call for ppc64 64bit apps

I'm trying to get the LTP clone() tests to execute on ppc64 in 64bit mode,
but I keep getting weird SIGSEGVs....even when the test reports PASS.  I've
been able to execute every test in 32bit mode without problems.  Has anyone
successfully used the clone() system call in a 64bit ppc64 app? And if so,
could you PLEASE enlighten me on what I may be doing wrong.  I've attached
one of the LTP clone tests, clone02, which returns PASS, but also gets a
SIGSEGV and has a non-zero return code.....which gets logged as a FAIL.
