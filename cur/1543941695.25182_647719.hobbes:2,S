Subject: [PATCH] x86: rename module scx200_32 to scx200
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/3/92

The module scx200 were renamed to scx200_32 by the
merge of the 32 and 64 bit x86 arch trees.
Keep the _32 prefix on the .c file as it is 32 bit
specific and fix the module name in the Makefile.

Found during audit for this issue.
One other file uses module_init: vmiclock_32.c
But this file cannot be build as a module with present
configuration.
Build time tested only but obviously correct.
