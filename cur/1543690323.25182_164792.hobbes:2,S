(from memory) I think that ext2/ext3 does (or at least did) this - they
lacked any smart logic for rapid allocations - at least for inodes in
the same cylinder group. I think this was mentioned in the "Journaling
the ext2 filesystem" paper.
This could probably be faked by taking out any intelligence in block
allocation (allocate last block+1 or some such thing). Even as a mount
option (seq_alloc), this could be useful (for this type of streaming).
This will give you great write throughput, but if you don't read things
off the same way you read them - reading is going to suck.
I read in a discussion of multimedia filesystems (for PVRs) that a block
size of 256KB helped in throughput when playback configurations weren't
known (the more data you read before seeking the better). google for
"multimedia filesystems" - you'll find a fair few papers on such things.
Things like XFS were designed for large, high bandwidth systems, so
that's also worth looking into as a zero-effort approach :)
