   No, it wouldn't -- that code come pre-broken for your sysadminning

   Unless, of course, you want to do something other than have some
   random process die when you run out of memory.
   given
	char *foo = malloc(GIGABYTE(1));
   it's a lot easier to check to see if that memory is there by doing
	if (foo == 0) {
	    /* our out of memory processing */
	}
   than to do the suggested
	long q;
	for (q = 0; q < GIGABYTE(1); q += magic_number_to_dirty_pages)
	    foo[q] = 0;
	/* if we get here, the malloc worked.  If we're really lucky,
	   enough of the system survived the memory allocation so that
	   we can continue. */
   or the slower
	memset(foo, 0, GIGABYTE(1));
	/* if we get here, the malloc worked.  If we're really lucky,
	   enough of the system survived the memory allocation so that
	   we can continue. */
   methods for really and truly allocating memory.
