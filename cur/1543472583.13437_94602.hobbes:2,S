I sent this message a while back, but I guess it got swamped.  If
possible, I'd like a reply.  Thanks.

It is possible to set the priority of different swap areas, but I could
not see any way to have better control than that.  For example, if one
has two disks: one fast, one slow, one might want to utilize them in an
alternating manner, but use the fast one more often.  Would there be a
way to create an additional parameter so the round robin goes AABAABAAB
or something instead of having to choose between ABABABAB and
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBB?
