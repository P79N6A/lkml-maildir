Subject: [patch] big IRQ lock removal, 2.5.27-G0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

the -G0 irqlock patch can be found at:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/remove-irqlock-patches/remove-irqlock-2.5.27-G0
Changes in -G0:
 - fix buggy in_softirq(). Fortunately the bug made the test broader,
   which didnt result in algorithmical breakage, just suboptimal
   performance.
 - move do_softirq() processing into irq_exit() => this also fixes the
   softirq processing bugs present in apic.c IRQ handlers that did not
   test for softirqs after irq_exit().
 - simplify local_bh_enable().
Changes in -F9:
 - replace all instances of:
	local_save_flags(flags);
	local_irq_disable();
   with the shorter form of:
	local_irq_save(flags);
  about 30 files are affected by this change.
Changes in -F8:
 - preempt/hardirq/softirq count separation, cleanups.
 - skbuff.c fix.
 - use irq_count() in scheduler_tick()
Changes in -F3:
 - the entry.S cleanups/speedups by Oleg Nesterov.
 - a rather critical synchronize_irq() bugfix: if a driver frees an 
   interrupt that is still being probed then synchronize_irq() locks up.
   This bug has caused a spurious boot-lockup on one of my testsystems,
   ifconfig would lock up trying to close eth0.
 - remove duplicate definitions from asm-i386/system.h, this fixes 
   compiler warnings.
