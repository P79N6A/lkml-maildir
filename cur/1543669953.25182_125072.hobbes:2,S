Personally, this is one reason why I'd much rather see a daemon-based model 
where each interested daemon can "subscribe" to the messages it is interested 
in. It's very possible (and likely, i.e. udev) that the steps involved for the 
daemon to respond to the hotplug event are so lightweight that creating a 
subprocess to handle them would be very wasteful.
Also, this lends itself to multiple levels of messaging: say, for example, 
userspace partitioning. How would the proposed scheme manage to invoke the 
userspace partition reading _after_ udev has done its job? If udev itself 
generated a message into the queue after the device node had been created, the 
partitioning code could listen for that instead of the native hotplug event.
