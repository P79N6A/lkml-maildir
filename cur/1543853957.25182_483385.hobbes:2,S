If the PCI bus itself isn't brought down, you could debug from remote
using Benjamin Herrenschmidt's Firescope on the remote node and a
FireWire card in the test machine. Once the ohci1394 driver was loaded,
the FireWire controller is able to read and write to the 32bit PCI
address range (and thus to system memory) without assistance of
interrupt handlers.
