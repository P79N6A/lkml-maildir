Never AFAIK... K&R, ANSI,ISO C89,  c99, whatever version that I know of...
You'd need -Werror and -Wmissing-prototype to make that worth it.
Otherwise the standard says they namesys requested "please make a good
quess as to what the args are...".
K&R didn't even have the kind of prototypes we know and love today...
So they shouldn't do this half-ass #if/#endif stuff.. either rip it
out, or be a man and make the compile fail when someone calls
znode_is_loaded , if thats what you really want. It's really over
silly anyway, as it will fail at link time if they had matching
preprocessor stuff around the function definition.
#if defined(DEBUG_THIS) || defined(DEBUG_THAT)
int znode_is_loaded(const znode * node) {return !!node->had_too_much_to_drink;}
#endif
