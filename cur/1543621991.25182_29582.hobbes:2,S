with kbuild-2.5 this can be done easy. We should maintain
the syntax of kbuild-2.5 (or a subset).
But the makefile/makefile.in will remain: not all code
in kernel is drivers, and for the non drivers makefile/config.in
IMHO it is better to have 'central' (per directory/per type)
config and makefile files.
