A command line user only needs to know about fuser, and in the unlikely 
case if the race condition Oliver thought of occurs he'll note since 
umount will give an error message.
I'd even say the more common case is to use fuser to get the PIDs of the 
processes and manually check which they are - e.g. you might not want to 
kill your OpenOffice with many open documents only because you'd 
forgotten that it still has one document open on the file system you are 
trying to remove.
