I wouldn't be so sure about this because it is possible that the real work 
is done by some kernel thread not the process...

That is no problem.

Well - I use it for /var/tmp for compiling packages in Gentoo. Most 
compiles use < 1MB of it and it is *much* faster that way because 
immendiate data never touch disk. And the disk stays idle the whole time 
so can be put to sleep and should live longer.
There are some compiles that take < 600MB and they are still done in RAM. 
And there are < 4 packages in this system that need extreeme amounts of 
disk (like openoffice for example). They of course are not done in RAM but 
it looks like they are still rather fast (but I don't have any 
meansurements). And the disk is still idle or nearly idle for the most 
part of these 8hs. Time shows that 6,8h is spent in userspace and I 
think it is pretty good.
So, to sum up, I need it in RAM and for the most part of the time (like 
99,99% at least) it is not filled more than 60MB. I could probably make it 
smaller and change to disk when such large package is going to be compiled 
but this will require changing Gentoo scripts or doing things manually and 
I want to avoid that.
