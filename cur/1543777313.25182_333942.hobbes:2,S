Hi,
utf-8 enabled vc consoles (/dev/tty1) usually show line drawing 
graphics with the ascii set, e.g. + - and | for lxdialog (and many other apps 
btw)
The following patch brings back the real graphics for lxdialog, which are 
normally present in these cases:
- non-utf8 vc
- xterm (u8 / non-u8)
I've just exchanged -lncurses with -lncursesw and I got the linegraphs back. 
This simple trick can only be used with lxdialog, for some reason(?)
Patch notes: There seems to be no change or impact for non-UTF8 users; but 
someone using non-utf8 for vc please verify this.
Valid for many kernels in the 2.6.x series, including the "recent" 
2.6.13-rc1-git3-someBigNumber I use.
