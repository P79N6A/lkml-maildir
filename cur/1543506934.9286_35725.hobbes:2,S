Where on the net can I find a detailed explanation of modules, and how to 
set them up properly when I compile a new kernel. I'm tired of compiling 
all my drivers into the kernel. It seems like everything works fine when I 
load the standard kernel that comes with a particular RH distro, but when I 
upgrade the kernel, I get all kinds of messages. Specifically, where's a 
resource I could use to set things up as tightly as RedHat does when they 
ship a kernel version.
On a somewhat related note, where can I get similar information on 
System.map? I've read on the Net that it's "not really needed", but I'm 
tired of seeing the messages about it. Also, how does a kernel know that a 
System.map is from a particular kernel version? I've tried messing with it, 
and can never seem to get it to work properly. Anyway, thanks in advance 
for pointing me in the right direction.
Eric
