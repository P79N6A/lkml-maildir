A #define is better.
You see, even if printk is a null inline function,
	printk("foo");
will still cause "foo" to appear in your output. Apparently
very recent versions of gcc have fixed this.
BTW: Graham Stoney prepared a similar patch for 2.2 last year.
You may be able to borrow some ideas from that work, and the
followup discussion.
