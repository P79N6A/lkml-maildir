Then you also agree with the patch to pci.txt?

Yes, that's what I would prefer and would like to see reccomended.
Would you like to see that order listed (like you have above)
in the pci.txt file?
A less precise list is in the first section of Documentation/pci.txt.
[ TODO: Can someone define which kernel versions implement "new style"? ]
There's more to this list unfortunately:
	DMA mask settings, MSI support, power state
And probably a few more that I'm not thinking of right now.
Restructing the document to list the steps, indicate which
are optional, and describe each step in order is more than
I can deal with right now.  Section 3 and 5 cover most of
the material but aren't as clear as Kenji's list.
thanks,
grant
