While I agree with you, I still think decent FTL (a) makes sense and is
(b) difficult.
a. Some people may be satisfied with FTL and enjoy all the block
device-related software, which is huge benefit, although costs you
performance. Yes, FTL moves garbage around, but who cares as long as the
performance fits the system requirements.
b. It is certainly not easy.
But anyway, I agree with what you say, although you seem to be too
assertive.
