Apply these rules:
1.) If you do provide an initrd= thing, the initrd is being looked for 
/linuxrc.
2.) If the root is the same as the ramdisk, then the initrd is _not_ run 
_implicitly_, and thus /sbin/init is executed, _instead of_ /linuxrc.

Only VIA IDE chipset maybe, but you don't usually need that for just-initrd.
You'd need that for the harddisks...

Make your own initrd and put a bash into it. Then start that, e.g. (for our 
linux live cd), initrd=initrd.sqfs root=/dev/ram0 init=/bin/bash
