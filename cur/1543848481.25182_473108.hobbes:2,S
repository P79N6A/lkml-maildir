I will give 2.6.19 a test in a few weeks when the dust of all the changes have 
settled a bit. :-)
As my Mike Galbraith suggested, I made some tests with renicing the IO 
intensive applications. This indeed makes a hell of a difference. Currently I 
am renicing everything that causes a lot of disk IO to a nice of 19. Even 
though this doesn't fix it completely, the occasional short hangs have become 
less common.
Unfortunately things have gotten a bit worse again since I switched my machine 
over to a linux software RAID5 (3 sata disks attached to the nforce4 ultra) 
even though I hoped quite the opposite would happen.
Have a nice weekend,
matthew.
