Hi,
I'm not sure if this is a linux or windows problem, but I've been plagued
with this for about a month now and it's driving me nuts. Ok, first my
current setup...
Dual PII 333 (not o/c)
256MB
2.2.12 SMP
3Com Vortex ethernet
NetGear NIC using the PNIC (tulip clone?) chipset
The 3Com is used to connect to my cable modem and the NetGear is used to
connect to my LAN. The other 2 nodes in the LAN are win9x machines.
The problem is that transfers of any kind from the win9x machines to the
linux box go at acceptable speeds, but transfers from the linux box to
either win9x box maxes at 10k/sec. I've tried both smb and ftp, so I know
it's not a protocol issue. I've tried other NICs, other kernel versions, UP
and SMP kernels, and any number of other things I can't recall. FYI: The hub
is auto-switching 10/100. I've tried using 10 and 100 Mbit speeds as well as
another hub.
Let me know what additional info, if any, would be of help.
Thank you,
Avi Shevin
