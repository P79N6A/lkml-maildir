I'm under the impression that the real smarts of bitkeeper is keeping a huge 
database of independent changes and only making a tree out of them when you 
ask to see the thing.  I.E. bitkeeper is a huge pile of merge logic that can 
take into account not just what the tree looks like now, but everything the 
tree has _ever_ looked like.
So a read-only client still needs all this merge logic.  Export is the easy 
part.  VIEW is the hard part.  The protocols to marshall the patches from 
point A to point B are almost irrelevant, it's sorting and integrating them 
into something useful that requires work.
And the reason Andrea hasn't found bitkeeper to be nicer than CVS is he isn't 
trying to integrate the work of 300 other developers into his personal tree 
simultaneously.  BK is really just a merging tool that fixes rejects 
automatically, everything else is details...
Am I wrong?
