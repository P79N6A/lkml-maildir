Unfortunately, the only long-term solution is to rewrite completely the
current in-kernel ieee80211 code (I would not call it a "stack") or
replace it with something another. The current code was written for
Intel devices and it doesn't support anything else - so every developer
of a wifi driver tries to implement his own "softmac" now. I cannot see
how this can move as forward and I think we can agree this is not the
way to go.
Rewriting (or, if you like, enhancing) the current 802.11 code seems to
be wasting of time now, when nearly complete Linux stack was opensourced
by Devicescape. We can try to merge it, but I'm not convinced it is
possible, the Devicescape's stack is far more advanced.
