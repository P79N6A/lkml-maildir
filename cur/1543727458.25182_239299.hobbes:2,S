Well there was a writeback bug which could cause files to not get written
back ever.  Perhaps an unmount would cause writeback but nothing else would.
It was fixed by the below patch.  The situation will only arise with a
combination of a race and a data-synchronising writeback (O_SYNC, fsync,
etc).
It's unlikely that this is the cause of this report though.
From: Miklos Szeredi <miklos@szeredi.hu>
This patch fixes a hard-to-trigger condition, where the inode is on the
inode_in_use list while it's state is dirty.  In this state dirty pages are
not written back in sync() or from kupdate, only from direct page reclaim. 
And this causes a livelock in balance_dirty_pages after a while.
The actual sequence of events required to get into this state is:
thread   function                             inode state         inode list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 __sync_single_inode (background)            I_DIRTY             sb->s_io
1 do_writepages ...                           I_LOCKED
2 __writeback_single_inode (sync) sleeps      I_LOCKED
1 __sync_single_inode (background) finish     0                   inode_in_use
2 __writeback_single_inode (sync) wakeup      0
2 __sync_single_inode (sync)                  0  
2 do_writepages ...                           I_LOCKED
3 __mark_inode_dirty                          I_LOCKED | I_DIRTY
2 __sync_single_inode (sync) finish           I_DIRTY             left on
                                                                  inode_in_use
