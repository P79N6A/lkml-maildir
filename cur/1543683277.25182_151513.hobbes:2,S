Yes, how often the component needs run will depend on the
fastest counter.

If you need to have userspace get instantaneous values it
would be more efficient to have userspace do the
update_64bit_counter code for just its counter than to have
multiple wrap checks.

Per-cpu counters.  If this is done a variant of this for
per-cpu counters would be helpful.  Per-cpu counters have
the advantage of reducing cache-line bouncing.  I don't
think per-cpu counters should be used as a band-aid
(elasto-plast) for counter wrapping.  Besides, how many
12Ghz 4-way hypertheaded (shared cache) CPUs do you need?
And if you only have one should you have per-cpu counters?
I don't think so.
