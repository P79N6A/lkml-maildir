If it's PPC side is limited to PPC amiga's (APUS), then leave it
in m68k. PPC Amiga's are really m68k machines with a hacked PPC
in the CPU slot ;)
Though such problems may come back if we ever decide to support
the PPC CPU cards for old m68k macs, and if I finally merge the
support for NuBus pmacs, oh well...
