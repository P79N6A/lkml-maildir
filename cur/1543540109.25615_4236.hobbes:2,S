I think the point is less HZ as unit (it shouldn't be a user visible one), 
but some programs want to know the timer tick to adapt themselves to it; e.g.
to calibrate their timers. Of course it is only an approximation because 
timer events can always be late in a multitasking environment, but it 
usually should work out.
