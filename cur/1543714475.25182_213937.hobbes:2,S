no way, you cannot bitflip vm_flags unless you own the mmap_sem, this
patch seems very broken to me, it should randomly corrupt memory in
vma->vm_flags while racing against mprotect etc.. or am I missing
something?

I considered converting it to a rwsem too, details are in the the email
I posted while providing the rwspinlock solution to the parisc cache
flushing code.
As I wrote there, I wasn't convinced in the common case this is going to
gain anything significant (the only thing that sleeps while teh
semaphore is held is truncate and truncate during paging on the same
inode isn't an extremly common case, especially for the big apps), and
it makes it a bit more complicated, but giving it a try will be
interesting. I was mostly interested about having the objrmap code very
rarely failing the trylock during paging (that semaphore is by far the
biggest scalability hit during paging of shm, but the cacheline bouncing
won't be avoided by the rwsem). To make the paging scale better
(something SDET cannot measure) I don't need a safe vm_set_lock, I
believe simply making it a rwsem is the way to go just to make the
paging potentially scale a bit better. I rated implementing the locking
abstraction to fixup the basic parisc race as a bit higher prio, after
that it should be easy to have it implementing a rwsem for all archs w/o
cache flushing, the abstraction will have to expose a read/write
functionality for the rwlock. I'm not convinced your double locking is
going to boost anything even if it would be safe, I'd just take it in
write mode when the tree is being modified, with the only object of
avoiding the paging to block (and potentially to avoid blocking against
big truncates too).
