Right, that's what the release agent patch for process containers does
- there's a file in the hierarchy root called "release_agent" that
contains the path to the program to run if a notify_on_release
container goes idle. When you mount the "cpuset" filesystem, it
automatically populates that file with "/sbin/cpuset_release_agent". A
workqueue task is used to actually do the notifications so that
references can be dropped without having to potentially run a
userspace helper.
