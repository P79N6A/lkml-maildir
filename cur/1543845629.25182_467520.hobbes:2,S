We normally cast pointers to unsigned long prior to assigning them to
64-bit values.  I'll make that change.
That being said, this driver is wrong to be storing dma addresses in a
void*.  And indeed there is a FIXME regarding this at
include/linux/videodev2.h:476, so I guess hiding this warning won't obscure
any fault which wasn't already known about..
