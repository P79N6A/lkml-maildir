I always get corrupted display with the trident framebuffer
(CyberBlade/DSTN/Ai1 pci 1023:8620, ibm thinkpad laptop),
no matter what video= option or fbset arguments are used.
I suspect the refresh rate is set wrongly, and tft's are picky
about that, although I must admit I never tested it with a crt.
it could be a consequence of Trident stealing RAM and linux not
being prepared for this too.
