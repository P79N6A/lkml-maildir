LVM _should_ take care of such devices as well, because there are several
block devices which don't live directly in /dev, especially with devfs.
According to "lvm_dir_cache.c", it should already check /dev/ida for disks.
If it doesn't work for you, this is a bug.  It would be useful if you ran
"lvmdiskscan -d" and "cat /proc/partitions" and sent the output to
linux-lvm@sistina.com
Cheers, Andreas
