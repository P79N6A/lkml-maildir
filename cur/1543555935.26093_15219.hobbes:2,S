The system crashes with an oops. I'm not able
to copy and paste it without pencil and paper, because it's hanging
during booting up. If you really need that output please tell me.
Imo you should just fix that the Tulip driver thinks there is a card
with a DS21140 chipset.
I'm using the right experimental driver and it's working. So please 
don't mail me about using the right driver.

Cheers,
Udo
