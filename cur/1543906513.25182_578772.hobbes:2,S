I had to do a fresh install of opeSUSE 10.3 Alpha6 to replace a failing 
drive. After that I again built 2.6.23-rc1-git10 which boots without 
problems. My guess is that something on the old hard drive got mangled. 
The old drive was PATA, the new one SATA, also disappeared have been the 
problems that suddenly appeared with sata_nv slow responses and timeouts 
with no devices installed and which I didn't see without the sata_nv 
module loaded.
Regards
Sid.
