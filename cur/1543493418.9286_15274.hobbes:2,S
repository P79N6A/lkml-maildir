If it was, then I apologise with all my heart.
From your comments, I was under the impression that you believed that
implementing capabilities should only be done on a system that scraps
all current security checks in favour of (initially alpha-quality)
capability systems, and I don't believe that to be either feasible or
realistic. It is for that reason that I offered my suggestion as to
how to manage the migration period from one system to the other so as
not to detract from the security of either system.

Actually, it IS a "production, security sensitive" system, as you put
it, at least to the extent that the company accounts processing are
run on it, and text files containing sensitive information are quite
regularly found thereon for short periods.

If you want to act daft, I'll leave you to it - you know as well as
everybody else that that's NOT the capability I was referring to...

In each case, that was precicely my point, so I'm glad we agree on
that much at least...
 >>> Format mismatch, not "can't be done because it isn't allowed".
 >>> Two quite different outcomes.

Agreed, but if the only way you can defend your argument is by doing
nit-picking like that, you've lost before you start.

Who's said they can? Your claim was that there's NOTHING related to
capabilities that can be stored within the file itself, and I for one
just don't believe that.
As I made clear from the start, I believe that the ONLY security
related capabilities that should be encoded in a file are those of the
"I can't action my intended task without these capabilities, so refuse
to run me if I can't be granted them" variety, which information MUST
belong in the file itself - it makes no sense at all to put it
anywhere else.
An example of this is the one I posted earlier, which you clearly
didn't bother to read through before you rubbished it: A binary stored
in ELF format effectively includes in its header the statement "I can
only be run on a system with the ability to load binaries stored in
ELF format, so refuse to run me if you can't do so". Likewise, a HTML
document file effectively includes within the file the statement "I
can only achieve my intended task when read by something that knows
how to handle documents in HTML format". OK, both are simple
capabilities that shouldn't need expressing, but I'm sure you can soon
come up with plenty of more complex ones.
One that comes to mind would be to have a capability that says "I can
only action my task if run in an environment supporting an X display",
and attach that capability to programs like Netscape or Xearth. The
ONLY place that particular capability could sensibly be stored is in
the file itself, and I for one would see NO problem with it being
copied from one system to another - irrespective of the system one
tries to run it on, the capability will remain true.

If that 'cost' is that I let a trojan onto my system that I could have
avoided were it not for that requirement, then I'll quite happily
ignore the said requirement, much to your obvious dismay.

I think you're reading far more into the suggestions to date than they
warrant. At best, they are various people's comments on steps that
could be taken, and other people's comments on what problems they can
envisage occurring as a result of those steps.

If I had any idea what your worries were, I'd be more than willing to
consider them, but I have yet to see even a clue as to what you're
actually worried about - all I've seen so far from you is comments
stating that EVERY suggestion put forward is fatally flawed without
your ever giving a comprehensible reason as to why it might be flawed.

Whilst I'm in full agreement with your conclusion, I'm unable to say
whether you're even near to being overcautious for the reason stated
above.

I believe most people have given up on that idea as a result of your

By following the suggestion that you rubbished several times: Restrict
the generally available backup tools to use by individual users
wishing to back up their own files (which they need no special
permissions to do), and restrict the backing up of security-related
files to a backup tool that's not generally available and has the
required capabilities to do its job.
You have yet to explain what you see wrong with that idea, despite the
fact that you declared it to be rubbish at least twice in this mailing
list, and I for one would love to hear your explanation.

Where did you get that rubbish from?
The backup tools run with the UID of the person wishing to use them -
for example, tar ran with *MY* UID about 10 minutes ago on this system
- and has access to the files that user has access to. I used it to
back up my files to floppy so the sysadmin can upgrade the hard drive,
something he's announced that he will be doing this coming weekend.
Since his announcement stated that individual users were responsible
for backing up their own files as there was no possibility of a
central backup being taken, I for one am glad that there's a backup
tool available that let me do so.

If it does, then it should be a backup tool specific to that task, not
a generally available one. Your proposal to use a generally available
one for suchlike tasks is an open invitation to crackers in my book.

WHere have I ever offered any such cop-out?

I'm glad you agree.
