On what planet do you live ? When you're a "consultant" (I hate this word),
you take the laptop you're assigned, and use it at customers'. And when
you're fed up with windows (ie: after about 2 hours of work with its shitty
hyperterminal and telnet client), you take any Linux CD and scratch the
install to be able to work for what you're paid, whatever the guy who
installed windows thinks about it. And when he complains to the staff,
you tell them to call the customer to be aware of the time they made you
lose with their inappropriate tools.  If my laptop cannot run a decent
telnet client, tftp server, tcpdump, hping, ssh client/server, terminal
emulator, a very fast tcp/ip stack which by the way supports adding and
removing thousands of IP addresses without rebooting, then let it die.
And as I said, I am one of the lucky enough to be able to choose. That's
not the case for most of my coworkers.

Willy
