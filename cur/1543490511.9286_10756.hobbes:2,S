No the BIOS failed to properly config the chipset or pci-config space.
I am working on some (want-a-be) bullet proof setup/init code, but it is
tough when your BIOS gets it correct.  I now have to hunt for a board to
borrow that gets it wrong.

It is nothing that "Aladdin" can do IMHO, it is how each vender of the
mainboards using their chipset in combination of the BIOS core.

Send the beer to Michel Aubry and Andrzej Krzysztofowicz, I gave up beer

I am willing to state that ASUS P5A series of mainboards are offically ALI
supported by Linux, but this is the only vender to date.  My tests are
based upon the ASUS P5A-B/300U.
