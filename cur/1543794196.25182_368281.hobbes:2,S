I am following this thread and this thought just occurred to me.
A few years back I installed Linux on a Compaq box and used fdisk etc. as you 
do.  It turned out I wiped the BIOS settings, and further investigation at 
the time revealed that they use a hidden partition on the drive for the BIOS 
stuff.  I told fdisk to wipe all.
After this, the machine worked ok, just that I had no BIOS options at all - it 
beeped a bit at me at boot, but came up OK and worked for a few years until I 
binned it.
Just a thought on what is going on here.
