If you committed the revert to the repository, it's probably to blow it 
away and re-clone.  Generally, with git, you want to keep a pristine, 
never-touched-except-for-pulling kernel repository around, and then when 
doing compiles and experiments and such, run
	git-clone --reference my-vanilla-2.6-repo $URL
The --reference argument will ensure that you don't haul around multiple 
copies of the repository objects, with each clone.
Otherwise, if you have committed nothing to the repository, this will 
undo all your not-committed changes:
	git checkout -f
