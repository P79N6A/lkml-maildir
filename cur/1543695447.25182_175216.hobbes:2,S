Can you tell us more about what really happens to disk drives when the 
power is cut while a block is being written?  We engage in a lot of 
uninformed speculation, and it would be nice if someone who really knows 
told us....
Do drives have enough capacitance under normal conditions to finish 
writing the block?  Does ECC on the drive detect that the block was bad 
and so we don't need to detect it in the FS?
