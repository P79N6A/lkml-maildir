I've seen your suggestion many many times. It always gets shot down. It
makes things harder to maintain. More work for Linus. It has very few
benefits (I can't think of a single one for me, actually; I always patch up
to the next version.)
I seem to remember Linus saying that if someone wants to do it themselves to
do so. Just set up an ftp site so people can download your packages. If you
like the idea, try it out. If it works, great. If it doesn't, we will have a
case study to point people to the next time they suggest it. :-)
