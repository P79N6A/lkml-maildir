Of course. That's why I'm calling for bug reports.

Sure.
However - Alan's IDE patch for 2.2 kills autodma on ALL VIA chipsets.
That's because all VIA chipsets starting from vt82c586 to vt82c686b
(UDMA100), share the same PCI ID.
Would you prefer to filter just vt82c586 and vt82c586a as the comment in
Alan's code says or simply unconditionally kill autodma on all of VIA
chipsets, as Alan's code does?
