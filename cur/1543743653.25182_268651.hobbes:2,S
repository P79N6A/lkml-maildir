Most of the tools on this machine were built on this machine:

I would modify the BSD source so it would compile and run
on Linux, then I would submit it. You can see, above that
`lpr` had to get modified in 1996 to accommodate some
changes (probably GCC changes).
I save all this to show that there isn't a GNU/Linux, really
a BSD/Linux.
Cheers,
