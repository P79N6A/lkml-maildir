Well it gets us back to the issue why we removed the lock. As Robin said 
before: If its global then we can have a huge number of tasks contending 
for the lock on startup of a process with a large number of ranks. The 
reason to go to mmap_sem was that it was placed in the mm_struct and so we 
would just have a couple of contentions per mm_struct.
I'll be looking for some other way to do this.
