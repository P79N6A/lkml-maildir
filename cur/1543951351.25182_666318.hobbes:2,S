Some systems (particularly those designed for hotplug) have the numbers
silk-screened onto the case.  It's like PCI slots ... my beige-box
homebrew PCs don't have slot numbers written on them, but the machines I
have from HP are very clearly labelled with slot numbers beside each PCI
slot.
Admittedly, the flashing red LED is a better UI, but it's not
necessarily as confusing as you're painting it.
