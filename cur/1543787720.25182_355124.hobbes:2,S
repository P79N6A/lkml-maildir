FWIW, you can already do this with Firefox (and Mozilla, I'm sure)
using the Sessionsaver plugin.
And while I can shed no further light on your idea, I wholeheartedly
support it. It would be a nice alternative to swsusp/Suspend2 in that
it could possibly avoid hardware issues involved with hibernation.
