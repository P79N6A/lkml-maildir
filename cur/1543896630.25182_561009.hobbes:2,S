Nothing wrong, but currently they are shown in "natural" points, i.e. in
those that the controller accounts them in. For RSS controller the natural
point is "page", but auto-converting them from pages to bytes is wrong, as
not all the controllers account in pages. I think that the better way is 
to show the value in the internal units and specify (somehow) what these 
units are. The userspace then can read them and convert accordingly.
