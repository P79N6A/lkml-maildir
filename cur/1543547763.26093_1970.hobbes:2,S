Some interesting mental mastrubation, but it not on topic.  You guys can
argue til your blue in the face as to why a kernel debugger in Linux is
bad -- commercial development houses are not going to buy your "control,
control, control" BS.  I am moving all of Linux over to MANOS which has
a kernel debugger.  The industry will decide.
