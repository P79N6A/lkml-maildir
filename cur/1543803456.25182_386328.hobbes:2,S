I had this entry in the "compatibility" section:
We need to be an 802.11 stack (i.e. drivers need to handle 802.11
frames).  Ethernet emulation is bound to paint us into a corner
eventually (if it hasn't already)
My opinion is that we need to 'bite the bullet' and make the kernel
aware of 802.11.  I figure we can leverage some existing work by
davem and acme for this.
