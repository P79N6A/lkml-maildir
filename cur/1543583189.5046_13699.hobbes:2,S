Andre,
I am not going to debate whether what they do is good or bad, there's
arguments either
way for the value in being able to detect a corrupted boot sector.
Unfortunately, this is how all the installed NetWare versions on planet
Earth behave.  If someone is rearranging a partition table and fills out
these values wrong, it will make the drive unreadable to NetWare, and make
it look like Linux just corrupted the drive (since Linux will get blamed).
The disk
tools should observe each OS's weirdness if it may potentially change values
in this
table and cause data loss.
