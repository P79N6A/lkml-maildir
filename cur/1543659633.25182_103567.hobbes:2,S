But it's not quite that simple, either.  If we say dirty cachelines
cost twice as much as read-only ones (ie. read + write vs. read +
discard), it gives some guide.  In particular, if a structure has
parts:
	struct foo {
		readonly R;
		writeable W;
	};
And it normally fits in one cacheline, but you set the alignment of W
to a cacheline, now it fits in two, you've lost.  (Note, struct
tcp_hashinfo is not such a structure, this is just talking to the
gallery).

No.  Thanks for the explanation.

A "read-mostly" section might be appropriate, then.  Of course, you'd
have to split the structure, in that case, and it's not worth it if
there are only a few of these.
Have I finally got it through my thick skull now?
Rusty.
