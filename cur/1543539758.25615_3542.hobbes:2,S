The problem here is that fixing a problem with the handling of a generic
command has to be done over and retested and redistributed and... a dozen
times, once for each device. And Murphy's law assures us that it won't be
done just where it matters most. It also burns up developer time (a
_scarce_ resource!) for no reason at all, and to booth the waste goes
mostly to repetitive, boring jobs. We _do_ know better ways of allocating
development resources, have known them for a long time...
