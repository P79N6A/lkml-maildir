Subject: [PATCH 0/9]: Various XFS inode clustering improvements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/21/275

Normally I wouldn't bother cc'ing lkml on XFS changes, however a
couple of these patches touch generic code. The changes to generic
code are introducing a WRITE_META bio type and
radix_tree_gang_lookup_range() and hence the wider ditribution.
This patch set is against the current xfs-dev tree so bits of
it may not apply to current mainline.
Overall, the patch set is focussed on improving the XFS inode
cache and clustering code. It reduces memory usage of the
cache by 5-10% and improves performance on some workloads
by 10-15%.
Comments welcome.
Cheers,
Dave.
