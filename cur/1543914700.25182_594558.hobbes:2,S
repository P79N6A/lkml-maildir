These patches all seem to be unaltered from what I had.
The first patch (x86: remove x86_cpu_to_log_apicid array) is in Andi's
tree as x86_64-mm-remove-x86_cpu_to_log_apicid.patch so I don't apply that.
The sparc64/ppc64/ia64 convert-cpu_sibling_map-to-a-per_cpu-data-array
patches need to be folded into the base patch so that we don't break the build
at any stage.
So what I ended up with was
x86-fix-cpu_to_node-references.patch
x86-convert-cpu_core_map-to-be-a-per-cpu-variable.patch
convert-cpu_sibling_map-to-be-a-per-cpu-variable.patch
convert-cpu_sibling_map-to-a-per_cpu-data-array-ia64.patch
convert-cpu_sibling_map-to-a-per_cpu-data-array-ppc64.patch
convert-cpu_sibling_map-to-a-per_cpu-data-array-sparc64.patch
x86-convert-x86_cpu_to_apicid-to-be-a-per-cpu-variable.patch
x86-convert-cpu_llc_id-to-be-a-per-cpu-variable.patch
where the four convert-cpu_sibling_map-to-* will be clumped into a
single diff.
