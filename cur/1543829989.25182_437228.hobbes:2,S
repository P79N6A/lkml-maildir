Yes, mostly webcam stuff, where there are active developers. Hopefully
those stuff will be fixed in time to 2.6.19.

Radio devices will be more complicated to test. Those devices emerged a
long time ago, and it seems that nobody is using they, at least with 2.6
series. I'm not sure if it would be valuable to port all those stuff.
Some devices even don't have pnp support (you need to specify IO ports
and IRQ lines).
