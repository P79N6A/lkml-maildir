I'm still not convinced of the latter case.  If a second user accesses
the file before it pages are thrown out, from my understanding there
won't be readahead but the pages will be put back on the active list
(ie. the dropbehind is undone).
AFAICT this patch truly biasses towards releasing pages from
sequentially accessed files.  So file servers where memory pressure
comes from lots of such files should be fine (bias will work correctly
against least-served files).
The main problem I can see is a low-memory server where we are currently
swapping out pages from non-sequential files (eg. gigantic running java
apps), and now performance might decline because we'll discard file
pages first.

I'd like to see it turned on by default in -mm, and try to come up with
some server-like workload to measure the effect.  Should be easy to
simulate something (eg. apache server, where clients grab some files in
preference, and apache server where clients grab different files).
Peter?
Thanks,
Rusty.
