I hadn't made that connection between the CONFIG_BROKEN and that, 
Randy, so if thats the case, its of somewhat less than showstopper 
status AFAIAC.  The card is, for watching never twice same color tv, 
working just fine once the cx88** & related stuffs are replaced by 
doing a make install in the pcHDTV tree, which replaces the following 
stuff in the /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers dir tree:
btcx-risc.ko
bttv.ko
cx8800.ko
cx88xx.ko
tuner.ko
v4l1-compat.ko
v4l2-common.ko
video-buf.ko
At some point, it would be nice if this stuff was merged, but for the 
benefit of how many would depend on sales of this and similar hdtv 
cards.  There is of course a cost vs benefits ratio to consider in 
any such merging endeavor.  I have NDI how many users of this card 
there may be about, but suspect the user base is growing 
exponentially as 'flag day' approaches.  Jack Steven Kelliher 
<jack.kelliher@pchdtv.com> could no doubt give a better accounting.  
Sales must be good though, the last order was large enough that he 
was able to negotiate a better price than the web page shows by a $20 
bill.  He passed that savings on to us.  Thats always appreciated. :)
