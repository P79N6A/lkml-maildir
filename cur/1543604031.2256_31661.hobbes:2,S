My patch is not providing "very small probability". It is providing _zero_
probability that fork fails. (assiming that there is more than half
vmalloc space free).
I'm just tired of this stupid flamewar. 
Linus, what do you think: is it OK if fork randomly fails with very small
probability or not?
Are you going to accept patch that maps task_struct into virtual space if
buddy allocator fails or not?
