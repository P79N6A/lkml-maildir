I ran kernbench and specjbb on a 16 way xeon ht numa machine (32 total
sibling CPUs) and an 8 way ppc64 machine against 2.6.9-mm1 w/ and w/o my
active_load_balance() patch.  Kernbench was marginally faster on each
machine, and specjbb performed better on 64% of the tests.  SpecJBB is a
bit erratic anyway, so I feel good about these numbers.
Kernbench results below. (2.6.9-mm1-ab is the run with the
active_load_balance patch).
