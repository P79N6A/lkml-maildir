Hi Hannes,

Is there an additional patch missing?
arch/alpha/mm/extable.c: In function `search_exception_table':
arch/alpha/mm/extable.c:48: `module_list' undeclared (first use in this
function)
This is -bk3 from v2.5/snapshots +your patch (-bk4 +your patch fails to
compile with the same message).
It looks like i386 replaced the loop through module_list by a walk through
extables which is not yet in alpha code.
Thanks,
