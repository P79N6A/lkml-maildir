I've assumed that Leendert is the author of this driver.  If incorrect,
please let me know.  If correct then the way in which we indicate that is
to put a From: line right at the top of the changelog.

Please don't use the sleep_on functions.  They are racy unless (iirc) both
the waker and wakee are holding lock_kernel().  If the race hits, we miss a
wakeup.
These should be converted to the not-racy wait_event_interruptible().
