I ma having problems with the pvr2 fb on the Dreamcast in 2.6.22-git17
- when the code is executed it appears to lock the Dreamcast up.
The problem seems to be:
 fb_notifier_call_chain(FB_EVENT_FB_REGISTERED, &event);
In drivers/video/fbmem.c
This hasn't been an issue before, so are there any recent changes that
might have caused this?
(fb_notifier_call_chain calls a succession of stubs ending in
__blocking_notifier_call_chain in kernel/sys.c)
