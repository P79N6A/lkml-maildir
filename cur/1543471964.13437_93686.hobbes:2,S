I'm having this same problem but it only happens when I attempt to comile
traffic shaper as a module.
Also unfortunate is I can't seem to get traffic shaper to compile into teh
kernel in 2.1.131 (I don't know about x.129-130 I've been incredibly busy at
work lately, this is also why I haven't mentioned it as of yet since I
haven't had teh time to explore for the reason(s) why.
