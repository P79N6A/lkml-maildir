Ahhh, now I see the problem.  You don't know many people :) :) :) :) :)

bullshit.
check out any recent hard drive : 
drive size = 40235MB*
* 1MB = 1000000 Bytes
there is _no_ standard for what 1MB means.  There is a LOT of
confusion, and most places will accept both
for example, the gnu ls command has :
  -h, --human-readable  print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M
2G)
      --si                   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024
This move might look weird, but in 6 months nobody will even remember
the change happening.  Less ambiguity is a Good Thing :)
