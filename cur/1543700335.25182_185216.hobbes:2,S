I just tried hammering on the sound drivers on the playback side. So I
put on a kernel compile, a find | cat >/dev/null and ogg123 playback.
Playback performed largely unimpressed from the load level, no skips or
whatever. Even adding a gnomemeeting connection didn't decrease audio
playback. My guess is that the audio drivers are ok even more so because
otherwise OSS _and_ ALSA would be broken for my soundcard.
That would leave me with two possibilities: 2.6. is doing something
different in the gnomemeeting case or gnomemeeting is doing something
different in the 2.6 case. A cursory look at the gnomemeeting sources
didn't give me the impression that it's doing anything which would be
affected by 2.6 deployment but I'll ask on the gnomemeeting-devel list
for advice.
Thanks for all your help, I hope I can nail it soon,

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
