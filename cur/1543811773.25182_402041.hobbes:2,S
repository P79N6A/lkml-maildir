Something like this would be really handy.  Check out fbmem.c:fb_mmap for 
a bad example of what can happen w/o it.
In fact, I think it might make sense to export WC functionality via an 
mmap flag (on an advisory basis since the platform may not support it or 
there may be aliasing issues that prevent it); having an arch 
independent routine to request it would make that addition easy to do in 
generic code.  (In particular I wanted this for the sysfs PCI interface.  
Userspace apps can map PCI resources there and it would be nice if they 
could map them with WC semantics if requested.)
I don't think it addresses the flushing issue you seem to be concerned 
about though.  I don't know the exact semantics of sfence, but I think 
bcrl is likely right that it won't absolutely guarantee that your writes 
have hit the device before proceeding (though it may do that on some CPU 
implementations).
Thanks,
Jesse
