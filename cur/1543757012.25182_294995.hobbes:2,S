Ok, so see Gentoo. Exactly fits your needs, it seems ;-) Dependencies are
supported, even paralell execution of init scripts are supported by default
design (you need to change only one setting to do this, IMHO, in
/etc/conf.d/rc). So it is already solved if you talking about the paralell
execution with dependency info in init scripts ...
Also the smf ability of Solaris10 seems to be interesting, but I don't want
to talk about it, since I have no time to see it in action, I've only read
about it, so ...
