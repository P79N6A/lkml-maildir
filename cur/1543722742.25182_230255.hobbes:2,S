Subject: [PATCH] [SYSVIPC] Change shm_tot from int to size_t

I see that shm_tot (the total number of pages in shm segments) in
ipc/shm.c is defined as int, even though its max value (shmall) is size_t.
Admittedly, it only matters for systems with >8TB memory, but shouldn't
shm_tot also be size_t?  The attached patch makes it so.
