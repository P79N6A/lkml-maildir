Does anyone here have or can borrow a MOTU Fastlane USB MIDI interface?
I'm having a nasty time trying to nail down what's going wrong.  It seems
that for kernels 2.6.17 and earlier, MIDI works fine through this
interface.  After that, it doesn't.  Most bizarrely the Dynebolic distro,
which is designed specifically for music, doesn't work with this
interface.  This leads me to believe that something changed with 2.6.18
that the MOTU Fastlane didn't like, but doesn't bother other USB MIDI
interfaces.
Here are some notes from my bugtracking:
Doesn't Work:
===============
Dynebolic (kernel 2.6.18, ALSA 1.0.12rc1)
Ubuntu 7.04 (feisty faun) kernel 2.6.20-16
Fedora 7 (kernel 2.6.21)
Works:
======
Gentoo 2006.1 i686 Live CD (kernel 2.6.17)
 If the interface is attached at bootup, one gets "cannot determine
 device number: Inappropriate ioctl for device".  After unplugging, then
 replugging a couple times, midi works ok.
Ubuntu 6.10 (edgy eft) (kernel 2.6.17, ALSA 10.12rc1)
Knoppix 4.0
