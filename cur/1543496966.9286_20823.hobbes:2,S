Hmm.  I'm usually quite adept at breaking kernels (bad luck, perhaps?),
but haven't had so much as a hiccup from 2.2.9 + Trond's NFSv3 client
patch + HJ/gam's server patches.  I'm running three boxes fairly
constantly, an AMD 5x86/133, an Intel P166 and a dual-Pentium II SMP
machine.  All the drive subsystems are exclusively SCSI (NCR53Cxx, Adaptec
7880, 7895 respectively - mix of drives).  Networked with 100Base ethernet
and all crossmounted with each other via NFS (don't ask).
Completely flawless.
