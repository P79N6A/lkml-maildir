I think this is a nice feature, although not on the top priority list.

We already support different resource groups for the very limit rlimit
interface.  If we can keep the interface clean doing separate resource
groups is fine.

Yes.  If you can design a syscall interface that is as clean as the two
mentioned above a syscall interface is the best way to go forward.

Not at all.  It just causes a lot of pain an complexity for no real world
benefits.
