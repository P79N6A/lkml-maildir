Thats very useful information. There certain have been (and it seems
still are) some cases with shared IRQ that are not quite handled right.
The 2.4.21pre5/pre5-ac work has partly been about fixing it. Deadlocks
suprise me however, since the problems I've seen have been I/O
errors.
However there is another known problem that does cause deadlocks with
the AMD76x, especially if the onboard IDE is used. Shove a PS/2 mouse
in the box, reboot and retest - if you dont already have one
