Yes. It was really nice organization of whole thing.

I have a doubt regarding nat-traversal. Let me first admit that I
don't have a perfect understanding of the NAT traversal concept. I
heard that IPSec is kept in a UDP packet and sent.  How does the tx
side processing happen (the host from which the udp encapsulated ipsec
packet originated). The last call in the stackable destination is
ip_output() as you said.
How does it go back to udp(transport) layer in this case.
