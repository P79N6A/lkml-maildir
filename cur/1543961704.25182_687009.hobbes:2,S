Yes.

Note that you can easily get them back by tweaking your sensors.conf
file:
chip "coretemp-*"
    compute temp1 @-15, @+15
But I wouldn't do it, as it doesn't make much sense.

If I remember correctly, at 84°C your CPU will start to throttle, at
100°C it will shut down. You still have 24°C before the former happens,
so it should be OK.
