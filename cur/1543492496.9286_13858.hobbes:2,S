It was my understanding that CAPs substracted privs: I.e.
#ls -l sendmail
-rwsr-sr-x	1 root	mail	276044	May 5 1998  sendmail
#listcap sendmail
-all but open root port
So if sometool copied the sendmail bin and understood suid but didn't
understand caps...
#ls -l sendmail
-rwsr-sr-x	1 root	mail	276044	May 5 1998  sendmail2
#listcap sendmail2
+all (no caps).
This is not good. Since caps stored in files would be used to limit the
abilities of suid bins, it's important to keep them..
Now if some sysadm were to remove the suid bit on one of the sendmail bins
(because he wants to increase security) that's fine, because the caps dont
ever increase security..
Because of this, it's at best important that caps be in the file, and at
worst not harmful that they are there.
