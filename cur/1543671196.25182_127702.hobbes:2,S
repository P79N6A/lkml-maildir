Maybe so, but on the other hand, game authors could, with some justification, 
accuse kernel developers of being the foolish ones.
There is already code in there that is supposed to fix up the timer: it 
doesn't work very well.
I wonder if SUS or whatnot has anything to say about gettimeofday being 
monotonic, so long as the user does not change the time.
