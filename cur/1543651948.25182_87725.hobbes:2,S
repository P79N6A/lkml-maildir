Sistina has a new website, it took me quite a few clicks to find where
they'd hidden stuff:
http://www.sistina.com/products_lvm_download.htm
or
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/
I consider LVM2 to be more bug free than LVM1, the only thing holding
people back is the fact that they will have to patch the kernel to get
dm.  Then upgrading from LVM1 is simply a question of building
libdevmapper and the LVM2 tools and using them.  There will be a new
release next week that will a bit more documentation.
