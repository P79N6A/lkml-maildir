More precisely, to index the file descriptors whih do _not_ have the
FD_CLOEXEC bit set - those are the file descriptors to copy into the
new process.
A more relevant optimisation is to make searching for new file
descriptors O(1) in accept(), yet that was discussed years ago and it
was decided it wasn't worth doing.
