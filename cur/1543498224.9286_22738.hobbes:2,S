If kflushd would lockup in lock_super you wouldn't see down_failed but you
would only block in __wait_on_super().

BTW, the last time I checked I noticed that the loop may also cause
deadlocks due out of request slots :(. The workaround with WRITEA in
bdflush seems to me only a way to hide such deadlock.
