Actually I think that sysadmin frameworks are the ones that'll have
the hardest time changing.  It's a different way to look at system
configuration, and changing basic models incrementally may not work.
User adoption normally lags sysadmin adoption for such stuff.  (Yes,
developers often wear both of those hats too.)
Luckily, all the usermode frameworks to boot and configure Linux have
had since the 2.4.0 kernel (or was that 2.4.0-test10?) to start moving
from that "historical UNIX" sysadmin model to something more modern;
Linux devices have been hotplugging for quite a while now.  All that
2.6 changed was to use it more universally; and with sysfs, that also
means stuff like "udev" is now possible.
Which means that any day now, all Linux systems (and their users,
docs, and sysadmin procedures) will be done converting!
