It's actually a good first-order approximation of the right thing to
do, as it will generally correlate with the userspace process
servicing that network load.
If not (for instance, with routing loads), then you'd basically expect
the charge to get spread around evenly in proportion to an
application's CPU usage.
The -rt kernel pushes most of the interrupt work off to threads, which
of course follow the same scheduling and accounting rules as
everything other thread.
