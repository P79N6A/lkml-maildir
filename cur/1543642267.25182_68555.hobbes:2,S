The corresponding get_page is just above, you must have overlooked it.
Besides that, we have a promise that the page still has buffers, worth
another count, and the page will never be freed here.  That's fragile
though, and this particular piece of code can no doubt be considerably
simplified, while improving robustness and efficiency at the same time.
But that goes beyond the scope of this patch.
The whole try_to_free_buffers path is hairy, scary and disgusting.  It
could use some critical analysis, if anybody has time.
