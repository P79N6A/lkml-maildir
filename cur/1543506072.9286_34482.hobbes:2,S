What would be the point of this?
Normal users can't insert modules anyway. Knocking out support for
modules insertion after startup just imposes limitations.
If a hacker has got the privs to insert modules, he could recompile
a kernel without the module-lockout-after-startup routines anyhow.
Personally I feel this would be a wasted effort.
btw: I seem to recall this (or similar) idea being proposed several times
in the last few months.
