A thought: any algorithm that fails to "reuse an ID for some time"
can be converted into one that does by tweaking the algorithn to
return an ID with fewer bits and putting a counter (bumped on each
fresh allocation of that ID) in the remaining bits.  Or, one can go
stateless and achieve an "almost never reuse an ID for some time" by
instead inserting a freshly generated pseudo-random number in the
unused ID bits.
