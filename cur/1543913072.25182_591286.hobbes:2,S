hm, where are its effects described in your explanation? Seems like a 
key item.

what happens if there are lots of such tasks? What limits the total 
bonus?

so my prototype patch is not an exact map of the nice-0 special-case of 
your code? Would this be the correct thing then perhaps:
+               se->exec_runtime =
+                       max(avg_exec_runtime(cfs_rq), se->exec_runtime);
Or if not, could you suggest a code-line at that place? Thanks,
