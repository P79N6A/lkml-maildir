I hate to kick the already deceased horse but..  
This appears to be one of the larger problems that nobody (aside from
this thread :) seems to be raising.  I understand Pat's logic of wanting
to keep the logical device a child of the network card,  but in many
situations (espically the enterprise ones with regard multipathed IP
storage, along with David's examples above) I just dont see how that can
be done correctly in keeping all the prementioned virtual devices part
of the network device's directory in the tree.

I am in complete agreement, from my little view of where driverfs
currently stands a non-physical tree is going to have to happen sooner
or later,  why not now?
