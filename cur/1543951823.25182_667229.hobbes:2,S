I'm sorry that I haven't responded to this.  I have some reservations,
but I wanted to try out some alternate ideas before just being a nay-
sayer because usually my grand ideas turn out to have fatal flaws.
My current grand but untested idea is that struct pnp_resource_table
is too exposed and should be better abstracted, even inside the PNP
subsystem.  Since PNP is supposed to be a way to discover platform
devices, I'm looking at the platform device interfaces for ideas.
Whatever we do, I think it has to be done incrementally to make it
reviewable and bisectable.
