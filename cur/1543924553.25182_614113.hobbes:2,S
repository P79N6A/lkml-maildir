That idea was in the Stacker module, and it was tabled until there is
more than one upstream LSM. In particular, it requires 2 or more LSMs
that actually make sense to stack together. IMHO TOMOYO/AppArmor/SELinux
are all exclusive of one another (in a running kernel) and real stacking
is still pending useful component intrusion prevention modules. Such
modules can be built, they just have not yet been built.

Just disable SELinux and load TOMOYO. Oh, you can't because someone has
made modules not be loadable :(  Hmmm, perhaps someone could fix that by
reverting the static interface patch ... :)

Exactly. Stacker was shelved, so to speak :) because of the lack of
in-kernel modules. Soon it will be time to reconsider that.
