Hey!
I Have a problem with the 2.6.0 kernel - it seems that the aic7xx-old
driver (which i also ran under 2.4) doesn't detect my normal cd-drive
but only my cdr! 
dmesg output: 
(scsi0) <Adaptec AIC-7850 SCSI host adapter> found at PCI 1/4/0
(scsi0) Narrow Channel, SCSI ID=7, 3/255 SCBs
(scsi0) Downloading sequencer code... 415 instructions downloaded
scsi0 : Adaptec AHA274x/284x/294x (EISA/VLB/PCI-Fast SCSI) 5.2.6/5.2.0
       <Adaptec AIC-7850 SCSI host adapter>
  Vendor: PLEXTOR   Model: CD-R   PX-R820T   Rev: 1.03
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
(scsi0:0:1:0) Synchronous at 10.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 8.
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 20x/20x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.20
Attached scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0
Attached scsi generic sg0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0,  type 5
- any fixes to make it detect the other drive: UltraPlex 32x
Thx
