Start transcode in one window, doing something like:
"transcode -i /dev/hdc -x dvd -U file_name -y divx4"
on a DVD ... probably pretty CPU intensive as well as IO.
Now do ls in another window ... hangs for about 5 seconds before
giving any output ;-( Anyone else seeing that? I do get a lot of
"*** libdvdread: CHECK_VALUE failed in nav_read.c:202 ***"
messages as well ... but I always seem to get those from DVD stuff.
All IDE, 2.6.0-rc1.
