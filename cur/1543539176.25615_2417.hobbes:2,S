Hi,
I'm trying out a new dual processor VIA 964 motherboard (as opposed
to, for example, a 440BX chipset). The board in question is a new
Microstar ms-6321 (694D).
upon boot I get a screen or two full of NMI messages. Near as I can tell
they match this message:
arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:
    Uhhuh. NMI received. Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
What does this message mean, and does anything need to be done
about it ?
thanks and rgds,
-Greg
