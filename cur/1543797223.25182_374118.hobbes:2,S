These are actually minor issues, with almost trivial fixes.  (Pending.)
And I'd argue about the priority inversion thing ... the inversions in
your stuff come from the API, not the implementation.  Which makes the
problems inherent, rather than fixable:  "more" exposed, not "less".

If this isn't a repeat of that priority-inversion case (fix available),
then I don't see what you're implying.  I have a hard time seeing any
potential for an issue there, since the I/O request path just shortcuts
to the controller driver.  It can't exactly get in the way!

I think you still haven't explained what you mean by this, other than
maybe reminding that PREEMPT_RT interacts with some implementations.

Hey, I started from that size *including* device interface etc.  If it's
exceeded now, it's because of the extra overhead from wrapping device_driver
with some spi_driver code.  ;)

Whereas I've just said such threading policies don't belong in a "core" at
all.  You may have noticed the bitbanging adapter I posted ... oddly, that
implementation allocates a thread.  Hmm ...
That is:  you're not talking about capabilities that aren't already in
the SPI patches already circulating in 2.6.15-rc5-mm1 (from Sunday).
They're just layered differently ... the core is _minimal_ and those
implementation policies can be chosen without adding to the core.
(Or impacting drivers that want different implementation policies.)

The point has been made that such chaining is actually "essential", since
device interaction protocols have constraints like "chipselect must be
asserted during all these transfers" or contrariwise "between these transfers,
chipselect must be dropped for N microseconds".  If the async messages didn't
cover such linked message, then two activities could interfere with each other
quite badly ... they'd break hardware protocol requirements.

My preferred level of convergence would be changes to make your code look
more like mine, especially where you're providing a mechanism that's been
in mine all along ... hmm, like spi_driver is the same now.  I made one
such change; maybe it's your turn now.  ;)
