The ramdisk driver is using this "blocksize" as what, in some other areas
of the block layer (and in XFS, but thats irrelevent here), is termed the
hard sector size - i.e. minimum IO size allowed to the device.  This gets
used for direct I/O size and alignment checking at the device level (the
block size of the filesystem sitting above the ramdisk has to be equal to
or greater than the device sector size).
The driver also uses this value for i_blkbits on individual block device
inodes (in rd_open), which in turn means buffer_heads attached to the
page cache pages which form the backing store for this device are sized
based on this, which potentially means many buffer_heads to a page. This
may not be what someone using it might have expected/wanted.
But I don't think these things are fundamental problems in the ramdisk
driver, rather design choices, and people using it should be aware of
the tradeoffs... what were you thinking of there in terms of something
more fundamental being wrong?
cheers.
