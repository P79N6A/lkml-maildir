    I thought that <linux/usb.h> provided a user API, not a kernel
one. In fact I thought that the functions provided throught that
header were syscalls. They are not, I've checked ;)

    OK, that's right. I really thought that there were syscalls
providing USB API for user space programs. That sounded less weird
when I first thought of it ;)) Thanks for the help :)))
