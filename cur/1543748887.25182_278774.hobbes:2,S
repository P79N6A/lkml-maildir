Presumably they meant 10 milliseconds.  Or at least, that is the delay
which the developer did his testing with.

argh.  Never do that.  It's basically a busywait and can cause lockups if
the calling task has realtime scheduling policy.

I'd say that replacing them with msleep(10) is the safest approach.
Depending on what the surronding code is actually doing, of course.
