I don't think it is a political issue.  I think the kernel drivers
should be promoted and I've encourated other distributions to go that
route as well.  And I hope that this leads to better drivers.  I do
maintenance work on the pcmcia-cs drivers but don't intend to add any
new functionality.
I've tried to update the kernel tree with fixes from individual PCMCIA
client drivers in the pcmcia-cs package.  The divergence of the core
modules is pretty large, though, so it is not a simple "diff", and I
know I've missed things.
I do not have time to be a more active maintainer these days, either
of pcmcia-cs or of the kernel PCMCIA drivers.

I don't really know what the scope of CONFIG_ISA should be.  I think
now it is mainly used to show or hide drivers for ISA cards, rather
than describing a system capability.
