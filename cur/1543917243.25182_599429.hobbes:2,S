It might be worth mentioning here that there is no timerfd function
analogous to timer_getoverrun() because the equivalent information
is available when the file descriptor is read.

Nit-pick: this should say "last successful read(2)".  Presumably a
read() that failed with EINVAL would not reset the count.

You should also add this error to your read(2) man page.

Another nit-pick, but you should really cast the exp argument to
(unsigned long long) to match the format %llu.  Although uint64_t is
the same size as unsigned long long on all current Linux systems (as
far as I know), one day there might be a system where unsigned long
long is, say, 128 bit.
