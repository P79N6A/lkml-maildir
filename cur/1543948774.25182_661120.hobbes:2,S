Casey, you aren't listening (why am I surprised?).
This is an interface to be used by NFS to get information from the
security module.  The information desired is specific to the MAC
labeling functionality in NFSv4 that is being proposed.  That
functionality is MAC specific (necessarily so, just like the ACL
functionality is ACL specific).  We are hiding the SELinux-specific bits
behind the LSM interface, and non-MAC LSMs are free to return NULL in
order to indicate that they don't support MAC labeling.  We do NOT want
the capability module to return its security blob here, or any other
non-MAC LSM - it will yield the wrong semantics for the NFS MAC support.
In any event, I don't think we need your permission.
