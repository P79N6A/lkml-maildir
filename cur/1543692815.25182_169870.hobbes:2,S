Augh. It also makes code even uglier than it used to be:
	...
	+               u16 group;
	+               if (copy_from_user(&group, grouplist+i, sizeof(group)))
	+                       return  -EFAULT;
which is really a memcpy() of two bytes at a time. That's disgusting. It
really should be
	u16 group;
	if (nr > TASK_SIZE / sizeof(group))
		return -EFAULT;
	if (!access_ok(grouplist, nr*sizeof(group))
		return -EFAULT;
	...
		if (__get_user(group, grouplist + i))
			return -EFAULT;
	...
which really is so common that it _really_ should be in kernel/uid16.c
(or, actually create a new kernel/gid16.c file) rather than copied 
(incorrectly) to a lot of architectures. Then things like the above can be 
done right once, rather than merging this that does the nasty thing over 
and over.
Sorry to just complain all the time,
