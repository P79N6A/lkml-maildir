You can use e2fsdebug to poke around a bit and to follow inodes. You
might want to start lower down the stack however and check the LVM
claims to be the right size for the file system and any partition data
looks right.

This is the stuff e2fsdebug essentially knows about - ext3 is ext2 with
journal so both are very similar.

Superblocks give you all the basic layout information. The disk is split
into cylinder groups which in turn are split into inode and data zones.
Lookups are essentially
	directory entry -> inode number -> inode block
	inode block -> data (first few blocks direct, next indirected once,
then twice ..)
The superblocks will at least be disk block aligned so a good starting
point might be to find the superblocks on the disk itself without LVM in
the way. That should tell you the start/end/layout of the fs and you may
even be able to then pull those blocks into a file and loopback mount
the copy
