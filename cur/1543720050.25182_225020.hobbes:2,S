There were a few places where arch-specific code had a cpumask_t type,
then took its address and operated on it as if it was a simple unsigned
long.   Where I was confident that I could correctly and efficiently
recode them using 'real' cpumask operations, I did so.  But in some
cases, I was not clear how to do this.  Grep for "cpus_addr()" uses to
find these cases.  The old cpumask implementation had similar macros,
including cpus_coerce() and cpus_promote(), for a similar purpose.
The "ideal" solution, in my view, would be to have someone with arch
specific experience in each affected arch code these uses of cpus_addr()
out, then remove cpus_addr() entirely.
Perhaps I should comment the cpus_addr() definition as 'deprecated'?
