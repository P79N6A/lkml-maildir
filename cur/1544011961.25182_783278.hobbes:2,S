I kind of agree.  I think that adding whiteout (and other bits) to
filesystems to support union{fs,mount} is kludgey.
But I don't agree that union mounts are useless without whiteouts.
Yes, file creation and removal will have unusual semantics, and that
might exclude some (maybe the majority) of uses, but definitely not
all.

Interesting.
It maybe worth mentioning here that fuse is also a very capable
"stacking layer" and with planned performance improvements it might
become the best option to implement such fs stacks.
