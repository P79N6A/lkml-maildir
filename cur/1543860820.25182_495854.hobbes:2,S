I'm sorry to disturb the schedule, but I'm not sure right now if this
pending issue of the e100 was meanwhile solved or declared a non-issue:

Auke, can you confirm that it makes sense to re-test? IIRC, our private
thread ended without resolution after I discovered that the chip
revision makes the difference for me. Looked like it is either handled
incorrectly by e100 or screwed up on that board.
