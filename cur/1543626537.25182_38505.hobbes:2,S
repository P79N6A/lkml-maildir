That would be the case _only_ under yet another interpretation of GPL.
Strange thing about GPL is that there are so many interpretations to
choose from :)
It is your interpretation that matters, not mine, so how can I convince
you? But I am entitled to an opinion that your interpretation is, in some
sense, wrong. Namely, in the sense that it is inconsistent with the
similar situation in the case of libraries or even system calls. I don't
see why exporting kernel symbols should be so radically different and
extremely sensitive to the nature of the consumer's license for some
symbols but not for others...
