That's certainly true, and potentially worth a clone() flag of its own, 
quite independently of the startup thing ("CLONE_SETTLS").
Ingo, how about breaking it down that way?

The fn thing is a purely user-mode effect, it's not there in the system 
call. Which is true of a regular clone() too.

spawn() to me implies doing the equivalent of "vfork()+execve()", the way
most non-UNIX OS's do new process creation.
I don't dislike the "thread" name too much, but I want this to be generic, 
and seen as such. The same way the original clone() was a proper superset 
of fork(), this needs to be a proper superset, not just in name, but in 
_usage_. If it's useful for only one thing, that's not good.
