Subject: [PATCH 9/11] sh: Add missing timers directory rule to build.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/27/275

This should have been part of the timer framework support that
was merged earlier, but looks to have been accidentally omitted.
