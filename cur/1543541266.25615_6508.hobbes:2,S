It has been some time since a reiserfs patch was cc'd to linus.  3.6.12 
(for release soon) should have our endian issues fixed (journal.c was not 
endian clean) and some other fixes.  NFS still won't be resolved, but we 
do have a working patch for it (still needs cleanup though).  After a few 
days of public testing, I think 3.6.12 should go along to Linus (without 
the NFS fixes), we'll see.
As for the memory issues, Rik is right, they are important.  Andi Kleen 
provided a good description of why they should not be show stoppers 
though.  Every day, practical use is still possible without the memory 
fixes, even though they would make the system better behaved (and most 
likely faster) as a whole.
