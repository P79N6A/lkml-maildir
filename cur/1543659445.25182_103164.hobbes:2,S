Download module-init-tools here:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/
RPMs are also available, but they're for MDK cooker right now and they 
might not quite fit into the RH structure. Make sure if you compile from 
source that the prefix is the same as the location of the current 
modutils (that you will overwrite.)
Hope this helps,
Josh
