If you're going to go with that, then why not just use a comment-based
markup? Then your alternate copy gets to be generated from the same
codebase. It also solves the inherent problem of decided on whether
a macro-based markup is far too intrusive, since you can mildly allow
yourself more verbosity in a comment. Not only that, but if it's
comment-based, it's even forseable, though maybe not desirable, than
*everything* that deals with this type of markup be maintained out
of tree (i.e. scripts generating alternate functions and all.)
