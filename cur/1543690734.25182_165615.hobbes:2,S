	This is a publication restriction, not a usage restriction. Your phrasing
above is like saying, "you can't put bullets into a gun that you use to
shoot a police officer". The restriction is on the shooting, not the
loading.
	Again, quoting the GPL:
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

	I'm not sure why you think this is an important distinction.
