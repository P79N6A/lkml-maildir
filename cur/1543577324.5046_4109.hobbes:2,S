No. In case of swap exhausted the page needs to be moved to
the active list so we don't clog up the inactive_dirty list
and have the possibility of a deadlock (already done).
In case of "write ordering not yet satisfied", the writepage
function should leave the page on the inactive_dirty list and
maybe write out something else (reiserfs, ext3, xfs...).

Rik
