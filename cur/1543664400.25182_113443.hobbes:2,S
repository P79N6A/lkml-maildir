Well, I guess count_and_copy_data_pages() is easy to share, OTOH it is
really small piece of code. Also do you think you can free half of
memory in crashed system? Thats what swsusp currently does...
[I need really little about LKCD... But you are going to need modified
disk drivers etc, right? I'd like to get away without that in swsusp,
at least in 2.6.X.]
