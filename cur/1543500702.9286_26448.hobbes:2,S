My guess is that if that is happening, and to everyone, that it
must be a kernel bug.  Any application that can crash the kernel,
means there is a kernel bug/misfeature IMHO.

Not yet.

gcc-2.7.2.3  - I believe Linus officially uses this, or 2.7.2.1
himself.  I never use egcs on kernels.  The redhat kernel is egcs
compiled though.

Possibly.  If you have problems with *ANY* kernel that is
compiled with egcs, recompile the kernel with gcc 2.7.2.3 and see
if the problem goes away first.

Not me.  ;o)
