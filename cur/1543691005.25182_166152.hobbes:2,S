In those cases, you simply use "-f" on the `insmod` command line
to force the loading of a module. We have that capability now.
But, the offsets of things your module(s) access can, read will,
be incompatible if the version changed. You "takes you chances and
cross you fingers...." if you use the "-f" option.
