OK, I was using ALSA, but I tried OSS instead.  I don't get the popping sounds 
anymore, but I don't get any sound at all.
udo:~$ dmesg | grep EMU10K
Creative EMU10K1 PCI Audio Driver, version 0.20, 20:58:14 Apr 15 2003
emu10k1: EMU10K1 rev 7 model 0x8061 found, IO at 0xdf80-0xdf9f, IRQ 10
Maybe this is not a kernel problem now, although 2.4.20 worked without any 
other configuration.  I'm running KDE, and I don't have emu-tools, but maybe 
I can poke around and see if I can find the problem.
Thanks,
Udo
