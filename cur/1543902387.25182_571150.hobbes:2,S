sure but, once again, if that's the case, why is it still listed for
(long overdue) removal?  you could make the above argument for every
single feature in the removal file, and never be able to remove
*anything*.

i should point out that some of the content of that wiki page was
extracted from the Kconfig files themselves, where those features were
explicitly listed as obsolete.  from net/bridge/netfilter/Kconfig:
...
config BRIDGE_EBT_ULOG
        tristate "ebt: ulog support (OBSOLETE)"
...
in addition, note my comment on the wiki page -- that the help info
for that option even *mentions* that it's been obsoleted by a newer
feature.

your points are well taken.  i wasn't arguing *for* the removal of all
that stuff, i was simply asking for comments.  i can see adrian bunk
has already made some comments on the wiki page.  but if various
Kconfig entries explicitly advertise themselves as "OBSOLETE", that's
at least grounds for discussion as to whether it's time for something
to go.
