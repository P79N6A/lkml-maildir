Cool, it's like 5 years ago all over again. It looks like most of
the kgdb stuff is going to need to be re-ported, as it's effectively
thrown out years of changes, and perhaps not surprisingly, blows up quite
spectacularly in the process.
At least this problem with KGDB disabled is an easy fix. I'll see about
getting CONFIG_KGDB=y resynced with the current serial driver and arch
stub.
