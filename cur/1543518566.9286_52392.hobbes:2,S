It certainly can be done, and it has been done.
Only the page table containing the virt addr 0xc0000000 need be 
different between multiple threads.
Page tables don't _have_ to be shared, either, they could, 
instead be duplicated. 
In this proposal, however, only the page directory need be
different, the page tables for all user virtual address pages
can be shared between threads which shared address spaces.
