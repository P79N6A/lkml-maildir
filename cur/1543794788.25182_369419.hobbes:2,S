  18,447 Pbytes, right.

18 Exabytes, indeeed.
Sun decided not to think about sizing for a longer while, and looking at
how long ufs has been around, Sun may have the better laugh in the end.

Is that important? Who says Sun isn't going to put checksumming and
compression hardware into its machines, and tell ZFS and their hardware
drivers to use it? Keep ZFS tuned for new requirements as they emerge?
AFAIK, no-one has suggested ZFS yet for floppies (including LS120, ZIP
and that stuff - it was also a major hype, now with DVD-RAM, DVD+RW and
DVD-RW few people talk about LS120 or ZIP any more).
What if some breakthrough in storage gives us vastly larger (larger than
predicted harddisk storage density increases) storage densities in 10
years for the same price of a 200 or 300 GB disk drive now?
