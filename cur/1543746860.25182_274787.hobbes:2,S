There's so much of debuging code that it is unreadable. When it is
separate file it is not so bad, but you'll have 1000 people going over
it "What is this", trying to keep it up-to-date with sparse
annotations etc...
Is not it possible to just debug suspend2 and then drop the debugging
code, not maintaining it any longer?

Well, I worry that now you'll be getting way too much
interaction... Anyway have a nice weekend,
