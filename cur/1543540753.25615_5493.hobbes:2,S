Subject: compiling modules later, after changing the configuration of the kernel

Today I decided that I needed the ethertap driver, so I ran make menuconfig
on my current kernel, and added ethertap as a module.
I then ran make modules ; make modules install ; depmod -a ; modprobe
ethertap, and lo, this worked. The ethertap doesn't however. 
Now, I was wondering, is this supposed to work, retroactively changing the
configuration of your kernel, and creating new modules?
It works for a lot of modules, is it guaranteed to work?
Regards,
