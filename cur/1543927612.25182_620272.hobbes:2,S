Can't find this function. But "INIT_WORK + queue_work" twice is very
wrong of course.

(just in case, in that particular case PREPARE_WORK() should be used)
INIT_WORK(w) can be used if we know that "w" is not pending, and nobody
else can write to this work (say, queue_work(w) or cancel_work_sync(w)).
So currently the code above should work correctly.
However, I'd say it is not correct, INIT_WORK() can throw out some debug
info for example, or the implementation could be changed.
I'm not sure about CONFIG_LOCKDEP (Johannes cc'ed). INIT_WORK() does
lockdep_init_map(->lockdep_map) but run_workqueue() has a local copy,
looks ok.
Oleg.
