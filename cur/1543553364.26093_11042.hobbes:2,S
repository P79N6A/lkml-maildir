egcs-1.1.2 is a reasonable C compiler. It makes a few errors under register
pressure and stuff. However its at best 'a C++ subset compiler'. 2.95 is a
fair bit better.
Most of these problems are also not the compiler but applications. gcc 2.95 
broke a lot of asm using code because the apps were wrong. Without the pain
they would simply never get fixed
