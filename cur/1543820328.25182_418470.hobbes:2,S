I would think that, if you could get your hands on some hw that defaults to 
the same values, you may easily see the same problem by doing this:
1. # vmstat 1 (or some other bio mon)
2. < change vt >
3. # cat /dev/hda > /dev/null &
4. # cat /dev/hda > /dev/null
Let this second cat run for a sec, then ^C.
Depending on your hw specifics the bio should either go up or down by a 
factor of 2 (on my system 25mb/s-48mb/s).  You may have to repeat step 4 a 
few times to aggravate the situation.
Note that this is not specific to cat, but can also be observed during normal 
random disk access, although not in a controlled manner.
Setting max_sectors_kb to ~192 seems to inhibit this problem.
Thanks!
