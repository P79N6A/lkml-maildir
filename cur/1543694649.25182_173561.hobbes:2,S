        Hi;
        I think you may be missing the point he is trying to make
in order to take your hobby horse for a spin;) He is trying to
claim, that he has a disk that is not dying, that has a bad
sector that he cant get remapped, and thus, there needs to be
support for bad blocks in the filesystem layer. (in the face
of the argument that modern disks make filesystem support of
bad blocks irrelevant.)
        As a side note, I also have a 6gig disk, which a few
years ago was, ahem, bumped during a write. It now has a handful
of screwy sectors, that I cant get rid of, even after doing
the stuff Norman describes. I used the -c option to e2fsck,
and its been doing great ever since-- a few years of use without
more bad sectors.
