I think maybe one partial possibility is to have a userspace OOM kill manager which decides what is to be killed when OOM is reached and it is activated by the kernel.  It would allow a few tasks to be unkillable (syslogd, perhaps, and other important crash-tracers), a few to be killable only when they themselves reach a certain unreasonable size (sendmail, inetd), root processes generally to be killable only when normal-user processes are dead (don't know how this works with capabilities).  There could be special kill-procedures for certain processes, etc.
Just an idea, may not be possible (i.e. may not function in OOM conditions, may be insecure, etc....)
