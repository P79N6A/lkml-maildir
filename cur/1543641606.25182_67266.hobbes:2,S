Some laptops, including the Dell Inspiron ones, (a) don't tell the
kernel APM when they're about to do APM stuff, and (b) have a buggy
APM and/or SMM implementation that breaks if the kernel has enabled
the local APIC. The workaround is to not enable the local APIC. If
this fixes your machine, please post your machine's DMI strings so
we can update the local APIC blacklist rule set in dmi_scan.
Events that would break the Dells include pulling or inserting the
AC plug, and hitting the magic key combo to enter the BIOS screens.
