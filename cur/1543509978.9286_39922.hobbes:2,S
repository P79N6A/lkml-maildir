No, no dhcp here. The machine in question does just virtual hosting, uses
IP aliasing and firewalling, and has one tulip card running with the de4x5
driver. When I adjust the firewall configuration, I like to restart the
network with the sysvinit scripts and that's when the problem tends to
crop up. Could be correlated with tcpdump as I'm usually debugging
something when I notice it.
