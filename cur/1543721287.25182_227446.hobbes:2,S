I would have done this ealier, had I not broken everything with my last 
kernel rebuild and had to re-install!  Kernel is back to 2.6.4.
The output of /proc/mtrr is:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x20000000 ( 512MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0x30000000 ( 768MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
reg03: base=0x38000000 ( 896MB), size=  64MB: write-back, count=1
reg04: base=0x3c000000 ( 960MB), size=  32MB: write-back, count=1
reg05: base=0x3e000000 ( 992MB), size=  16MB: write-back, count=1
reg06: base=0xf0000000 (3840MB), size=   4MB: write-combining, count=1
And the physical RAM map bit is:
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
