Running a vendor kernel has the advantage of reusing all the QA work 
that has gone into that kernel.  It is very different from running 
2.6.24-rc1 (or 2.6.22.x).  Hence projects like centos: you don't get any 
support, but the likelihood of actually requiring support is lower than 
running some random kernel.
[but I agree that someone who has somehow determined that they need a 
specific LSM will probably have determined that they need vendor support 
as well]
