I have seen these exact same error!
I found out that it was unsupported hardware issue.
Machine A windows98 with a SVEC PNT102TX 10/100 Adapter.
Machine B Linux running RH with a Intel Etherexpress Pro 10/100
Every time I booted my machine there the machines would connect for about 5
minutes with really bad performance so I started using tcpdump to find out
what was going on. Then these exact same errors appeared.
For me it ended up being that the SVEC adapter did not support PCI steering
(IRQ sharing) in Windows98. 
My options were to disable the PCI steering or swap the Ethernet adapters in
the two machines.
I swapped them.
But these errors were reported under Linux because of hardware errors coming
from the SVEC adapter.
Hope this additional info helps.
