For what it's worth, I haven't had any problems with Con's O19int.  I've 
been trying to repeat a case of priority inversion I experienced with 
O18.1...but it seems to be cured (and that was really my only problem 
with it).  I was already getting fewer skips in XMMS with 
2.6.0-test3-mm2 than I did with 2.4.18 and the same sort of workload.  I 
can't really test xmms now that the ACPI changes have obliterated my 
chances of freeing IRQ 5 for my sb16 -- but from the improvements I feel 
in the last few patches from Con, I imagine that it wouldn't skip 
anymore.  (On a side note, I really miss xmms where random means quite 
random, unlike my CD changer which is repeat the same songs in a four 
hour block.)  I certainly am not running any sort of high-end machine 
with a K6-2 400 ;-)  The mouse might lag slightly for a few seconds when 
starting up a build, but as soon as the scheduler adjusts, I can't tell 
whether I have four builds running at the same time or just one.  In 
2.4.18, it has a slow feeling that let's you know the system is loaded 
-- and it never goes away (well, until the compiling's done).
