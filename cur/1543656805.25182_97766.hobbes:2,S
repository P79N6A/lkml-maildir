Hi all,

<snip>
scsi0 : 3ware Storage Controller 1.02.00.006
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: 3ware     Model: 3w-xxxx           Rev: 1.0
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 00
</snip>
would it be hard to add the 3ware model? "3w-xxxx"... hmmmm... 
currently I want to buy some more controllers and want to get the same 
as I currenty have - but I really can't remember which ones I own 
;-)))) 
And I don't want to reboot (hey, I would loose my uptime) ;)))
I now run these controllers on 6 of my 6 servers and all run without 
problems. Isn't it time to change the driver's status? Iirc it is 
still marked "experimental"....
Bye
  Michael
