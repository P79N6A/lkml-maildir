You --examine component devices of an array, not the whole array.

This suggests that the superblock is currently the correct byteorder
for the current host.  You use
   mdadm --examine --metadata=0.swap /dev/sda1
when you have moved a devices from one host to different host with the
opposite endian-ness (e.g. bigendian to littlendian).

I cannot remember where you were moving 'from' or 'to', but what you
have to do is:
  1/ move the devices to the new computer.
  2/ use "mdadm --examine" to make sure they are where you expect them
      to be.  Use "--metdata=0.swap" if the byteorder is different on
      the new machine.
  3/ Once you are satisfied that things look right, use
       mdadm --assemble /dev/md0 --update=byteorder ....
    to assemble the array.  This will change the byteorder in the
    superblocks.  After you have done this, the array will assemble
    normally on the new machine, but will not if you move it back to the
    old machine. If you want to use the old machine again, you need to
    use --update=byteorder again.
Does that make it clear?
