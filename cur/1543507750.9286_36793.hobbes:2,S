Hello,
There is something strange going on with setting video=vesa:mtrr kernel
parameter. In the old days, the mtrr for the video framebuffer was set
automagically without any parameters. Then, in the process of time, it
came to pass that one needed to set video=vesa:mtrr to get mtrr set. Now
(2.3.13) even that doesn't help - I have to login as root and do the
usual:
echo "base=0xfd000000 size=0x400000 type=write-combining" > /proc/mtrr
to get it working.
Is someone making sure that some sort of consistency is achieved
eventually?
Btw, booting 2.3.15 with vesafb did not work. I didn't try 2.3.16 yet.
Regards,
Tigran.
