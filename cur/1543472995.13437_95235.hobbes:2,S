I think the double negative triggered a bug in your parser.  :-)  Quoting 
from the GNU General Public License, version 2:
::   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid      
:: anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  
:: These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
:: distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
This is indeed "designed to restrict your right to restrict rights" --- with 
respect to the GPL.  (It does not prohibit, and indeed can't prohibit, 
someone releasing their own code under both the GPL and a more restrictive 
license, but that is a different issue entirely.)
As for why this might indeed be seen as restrictive (aside from the obvious 
restrictions which the GPL is specifically intended to deny):  it is my 
understanding that the BSD license is incompatible with the GPL in part 
because it restricts the right to use the name of UC Berkeley in 
advertizing.  If true, this is decidedly strange and somewhat disconcerting 
--- it implies that there are other surprises lurking wherever the GPL 
intersects with another license.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
