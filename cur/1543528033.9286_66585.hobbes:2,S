Well, you're probably never interested in using a PCMCIA card either, are
you? 
Or a number of other buses which actually do use probing.

"disable_irq()" is slow and requires the irq lock you want to get rid of
for synchronization: on pretty much every single architecture out there
interrupts are not "synchronous" wrt the core, so you cannot even disable
an interrupt without having extra synchronization (which is exactly what
the spinlock in do_IRQ gives you).
Many architectures do not have atomicity guarantees in SMP: you may end up
getting the same interrupt twice on two CPU's. The spinlock handles that
case too.

Pretty much all of it IS required.

They require that interrupts be on. 
Hint:
	CPU1					CPU2
	disable_irq();
		-- pending  due to synchronization --
	...
						cli();
	enable_irq();
which you'll have on pretty much any architecture.

And the cost of it is what? Zero.

Feel free to try it.  It was discussed, but it's not trivial to do
correctly. You get the IRQ_PENDING problem even more clearly (ie it
becomes a problem even with well-designed interrupt controllers).

It's only necessary for hardware that doesn't work the way we want it to
work.
Which, sadly, is pretty much anything out there.
