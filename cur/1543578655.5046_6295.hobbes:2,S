Well, with 'this' (in 'could THIS be') I really meant the move from disable_irq
to the irq_safe spinlocks. I'm currently running with the patched 8390.c
driver, patched io_apic (TARGET_CPUS 0xff) and patched apic.c (focus cpu
enabled), and have had no problems yet... even though I'm running several
simulatnsous nfs cp -rd <big_dir>, streaming network audio, scanning with an
USB scanner, etc.
So far, it seems that the patch to 8390.c removed the symptoms. The changes to
apic.c and io_apic.c did not make the network hang come back.
