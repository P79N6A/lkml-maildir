And the Linux kernel community has been familiar with this situation all 
along.  It's the bargain the kernel developers struck with each other a 
decade and a half ago.
Now the FSF is coming along and being Darth Vader: "I am altering the bargain.  
Pray I don't alter it any further."

That's not specifically a limitation of the GPL, that's a limitation of 
copyright law which forms the basis of the GPL.  It covers distribution, not 
usage.
GPLv2 eliminates the case where I have a modified binary I contributed to, but 
can't see the source code of those modifications.  This has the pragmatic 
effect of greatly reducing forking in a project, such as the Emacs/Lucid 
Emacs fork that inspired the "Emacs license" that became GPLv1.
