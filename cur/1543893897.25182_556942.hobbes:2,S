    Your message is very peculiar... because I already have a similar
thing working on my system ;))) I tried FSVS and I didn't like it fully
(don't ask me why, I don't even remember, that was a time ago), so I
wrote my own system.
    Instead of a complex solution, I opted for a simple (but ad-hoc)
solution, writing a pre-commit-hook in Perl and a couple of files to
store the metadata. Very simple but I have all my system configuration
files (and other files that I want to have versioned) under SVN.
    Thanks for your suggestion anyway, because I think that the concept
(having versioned system files) is interesting and very useful :))
