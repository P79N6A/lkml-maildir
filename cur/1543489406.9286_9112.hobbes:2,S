Hi all,
	Got a question for you that I havn't been able to find the answer to,
possibly you can help.  Appoligies in advance if the answer is located
somewhere obvious or has been answerd before,  Forgive me I come from an M$
background..
	I understand the concept of a modular vs monolithic kernel.
	What is the speed tradeoff for each method ?.  
	I have a P100 with 32M memory and 50M or so swap {which hardly seems to
get used} but the systems _feels_ slow.
	Is a smaller Kernel (ie using modules) with the auto modle loader (what's
it called again) running in the background going to operate faster than the
same items made into a monlithic one ?.  Or is the currently 'inactive'
parts of a monolithic kernel going to suck more CPU cycles than the module
loader would use.
	I realise that there are probably some other factors that effect the
answer to this question (the number of modules for instance) but can I get
a _general_ answer ?
	thanks in advance..
