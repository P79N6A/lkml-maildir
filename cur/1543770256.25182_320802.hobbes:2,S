That won't be a problem if all apps with write access are running as 
root or setuid and thus the list of them is well-controlled by root.

In fact both approaches are used in the kernel.
(1) is used in the usbfs code, and thus SANE and gPhoto2 rely upon it 
(BTW it's still possible for a user to install an old version of SANE 
into /home/user and damage a scanner). Proper filtering in the kernel 
would be probably just too complex in this "usb generic" case.
(2) is used e.g. in DRM code.
What's missing is a clearly stated policy that says which of those two 
approaches should be applied in each particular case.
