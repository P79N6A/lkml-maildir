This makes the procedure take a bit longer, but things like missing 
semicolons get caught in the process ;-)
So let's drop Linus/Marcelo/lkml from CC. I'll submit the patch 
eventually. (If it's already applied, that's fine, too)
Generally the patch looks good (still wondering if you've got that many 
cards in one machine).

nitpicking:
This should be
		} else
			cards[i]...
Actually, I'd prefer
		} else {
			cards[i]...
		}
I'll fix up these small bits, commit it to our CVS and take care of 
submitting the patch.
Thanks again for your work.
