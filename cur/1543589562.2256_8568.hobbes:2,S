duh! You argue over bandwidth due to sigs >4*80, and
other ppl here are QUOTING SIGS which is much worse,
and even the kcsf-ing LMKL footer.
And yep I have a .sig which I don't use on LKML due
to bandwidth.
Another point: look at the headers. I'd like LKML to
strip all these X- thingies, the "Received:" etc.
so that the messages I get have a bare minimum header
consisting just of To: and Subject: (maybe MIME).
