Linus please apply to next pre patch, I understood from David that for
him the direct mapping can overlap the vmalloc virtual address space, it
really doesn't make much sense to me but since this is a noop for me and
I trust him, we can really delay this to 2.5:

 	dir = pgd_offset_k(address);
+	flush_cache_all();
 	spin_lock(&init_mm.page_table_lock);
 	do {

And btw, now I suspect David can have also have an arguments for the
tlb_flush removal (infact the problem is the same, if the address space
is shared by direct mapping and vmalloc we'd also need to flush the
tlb), but such one isn't really a noop for the other archs so I will be
more concerned not to reintroduce it and to at least just put an #ifndef
__i386__ around it (safe for both parts).
