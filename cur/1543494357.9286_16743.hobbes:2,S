Its hard not to hit ^X when you mean ^C and you've just stood up at 22.00
in the evening. :-)
Anyways, the question was how I could get a simple fb device up and
running on a machine with a BIOS that is not VESA 2.0 compliant. It needs
to have 1280x1024 in 16 bit, noone should ever change resolution, depth or
something. Is there some driver/patch/... that could do this?
