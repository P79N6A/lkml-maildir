A couple of reasons:
* The "handled" value needs to be passed around so handler know if 
previous handlers have already handled the NMI.
* It allows the list of registered NMI handlers to be dumped in 
/proc/interrupts
I thought that the notifiers callout used locks (which would be a 
no-go), but it doesn't.  So I can scratch that one from my list.
Thanks,
