Hi, 
Jeff Garzik sent me a SATA update to be merged in 2.4.x. 
A lot of new boxes are shipping with SATA-only disks, and its pretty bad
to not have a "stable" series without such industry-standard support.
This is the last feature to be merged on 2.4.x, and only because its quite 
necessary.
Any oppositions?
