Moreover, the performance must be considered, sure, but after all, "man 
pthread_cond_broadcast" says:
<<
        If more than one  thread  is  blocked  on  a  condition  variable,  the
        scheduling  policy  shall  determine  the  order  in  which threads are
        unblocked.

(of course, "shall" does not mean "mandatory", I know ;-) )
