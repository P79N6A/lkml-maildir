Ah, I forgot to tell you about the tq_scheduler task queue. It I remeber
well tasks queued on it, can run at the same time of bh handlers, but I
don't think it's good for you since it doesn't run on regular basis (just
to make more clear it's not called frequently as a timer_bh or an
immediate_bh). As its name tells you, it's called upon schedule().
