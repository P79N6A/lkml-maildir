Providing the viewer is translating the originals always exist. Indeed
you can do
	LANG=es view-logs
	LANG=ru view-logs
	...
You can have sysadmins with no common language("not a recommended

You are right about needing to log parameters, but given a log line

%s: went up in flames\n\0eth0\0\0
that can be handled by the log viewer
