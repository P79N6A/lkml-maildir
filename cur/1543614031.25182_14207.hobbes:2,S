This "international" standard seems to have excluded a few countries. 
It wasn't until it was SET that I even heard of its existance. (And 
then only through SLASHDOT!)
Everyone I know has been using KB/MB/GB for 1024 forever. The *only* 
exception is networking, and the occasional FLASH/ROM size. The latter 
isn't very common discussion, and among those that it is, they'd know 
what the other was talking about. For the former, I can distinguish 
easily depending on who it is.
Someone without a lot of experience: I have a 1MB connection. (this 
user has a 1 Megabit connection)
Someone with experience: I have a 1mb/Mb connection. (This person has a 
1 megabit connection has used a "standard" abbreviation.)
Know how these standards came about?
Actual use. Not a bunch of "engineers" in a room arguing over how best 
to cause absurd changes in kernel help files.
