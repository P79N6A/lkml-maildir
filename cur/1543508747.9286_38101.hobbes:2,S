Hello,
   I'm wondering if this is the best place to ask this question, but here it
goes:
   I'm running kernel 2.2.10 on an AMD K6 300 with 64megs of RAM and a
64Megabyte swap partition. I've noticed this problem recently: If I open a
few Netscape windows (6 or 7) and say several full screen images I start to
run out of memory. There's a lot of disk activity when this happens and the
computer slows to a crawl, kills a few applications here and there and when I
can get a hold of a terminal and kill Netscape, things go back to normal.
Sometimes, though the Window Manager closes/crashes and I have to relog.
   Is this normal behaviour or is there something wrong with my system?
Thanks
--Erico.
