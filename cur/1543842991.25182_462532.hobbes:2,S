Subject: sbpcd.c: fix check_region to request_region
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I looked at Linux Kernel Janitor project. There is a request of fixing
the old check_region function to request_region function. I did a grep
on the source tree and found several check_region. I will continue
fixing them after this patch is accepted. Please tell me if I'm doing
the submission correctly.
ChangeLog
- The file needs to be patched because it used deprecated check_region
function
- The check_region in the file simply checks if the region of memory is
available. I replaced that line with request_region followed by
release_region to make the check
- I do not have testing result available. I am sending this email to the
maintainer for testing. The maintainer probably has the specific CD-ROMs
to test my patch.
The kernel version for the patch is 2.6.18-rc6
