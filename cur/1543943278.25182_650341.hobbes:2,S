I at least found this post:

 though I remeber

Sorry, I meant the opposite. I needed the acpi_skip_timer_override kernel 
parameter for nforce2, thus no override. So this chipset is missing here. At 
least I remember that my nforce2 needed the skipping, 
otherwise the timer stayed in XT-PIC mode even when APIC was requested.

I haven't tested it, but it would "work" as it would bail out in my case 
because of the hpet check. The problem I see with this approach - as with the 
old one -  it simply wants to ignore the override for a whole bunch of 
chipsets. (The old one is catastrophic as it even doesn't care for chipset 
revision.)  And checking for hpet is just heuristics (or what is the 
rationale behind it?) not a real check whether the override should be ignored 
or not. Are you actually sure that so many nforceX boards have broken bioses? 
References? I would prefer a DMI check and only apply the quirk for *known* 
broken bioses instead fo "blindly" doing it as in my case my mcp51 system is 
unstable with the quirk applied - it *never* needed the quirk.
I found this:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/patches/test/2.6.5/20040422223905-nforce2_timer.patch
So it seems the original (proposed?) version did a DMI check for known broken 
bioses. Why was this approach abandoned?
According to
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/19/427
it seems only nforce2 and perhaps some nforce3 are relevant.
To sum it up, I think it is a step into the right direction, but still not 
correct.
