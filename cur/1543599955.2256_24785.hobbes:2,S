If it works, hack kernel not to send dupacks. What is the problem? :-)
Yes, on such links fast retransmit is not useful in any case.
Actually, you can make something from your side: if rtt is so high,
most likely this means excessive queueing. You can fight this
advertising smaller window (f.e. adding option "window N" to route).
If intepacket gap is 5sec and rtt 23, you can divide window by 23/5
and rtt should drop to some more reasonable number. "Theoretical"
bandwidth will reduce, but practical will grow.

Yes, it is intersting.
