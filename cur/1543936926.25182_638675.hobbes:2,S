Hi,
Well, it goes along the lines of the patch I suggested as a reply to
Adrian, with these differences :
- I still source the kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation file.
- I put back the missing OPROFILE options directly in arch/arm/Kconfig
Then end result is the same as your patch, but without the code
duplication.
Here is the patch :
Fix ARMv6 oprofile support
This patch restores the ARMv6 OProfile support that was killed by
commit 09cadedbdc01f1a4bea1f427d4fb4642eaa19da9.
It puts the config options in arch/arm/Kconfig.
Thanks to Adrian Bunk for finding this bug and providing an initial
patch.
Changelog :
Use def_bool.
