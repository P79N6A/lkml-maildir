So I not alone, thats comforting (I think)
I just woke up, and I think the next test compile will be done without 
the pre-emptable bkl turned on.  That was the only diff in the config 
I saw when my script ran a make oldconfig, and it defaulted to a Y so 
I accepted it when it ran.
Half an hour later (mount had to e2fsck a couple BIG partitions) 
Ok, that fixed it and I'm running on it now.
That was the checkbox to make the big-kernel-lock pre-emptable that I 
unchecked in a "make xconfig".
So I guess that particular patch still needs help.
I also took this back to the lkml for others to be made aware.  But I 
wonder whats so odd about our two systems, so far, we are the only 
ones to be effected, so lets compare notes:
AMD Athlon 2800xp, biostar N7-NCD-Pro motherboard with an nforce2 
chipset, and using the forcedeth driver for eth0.  A gigabyte of 
DDR400 rated ram running in DDR333 dual channel mode, the 2800xp 
Athlon can't handle the DDR400 fsb correctly. No acpi is enabled, and 
apm only for shutdown control & rtc handling.
