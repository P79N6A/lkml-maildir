Consider getting your driver into the standard kernel - then you get less
problems with header changes. (Those who change headers usually
keep the standard tree working.)  If you want to keep a driver for yourself
though, then you need to keep fixing it continously jsut to keep up with
the standard kernel.  And if you want SUSE customers, then you need to
keep up with their patches too.  An so on for all the other distributions.

_Why not_?  It is not something I worry about.  Forks happen, but
go away as the forked stuff either is merged back into the std. kernel
(if it is good) or becomes obsolete after a few months.  Anyone who
maintains their own fork get the burden of keeping up with
Linus - this limits the forking.
