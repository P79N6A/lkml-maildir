I wish it was that simple wrt cpu hotplug lock :)
It was not just cpufreq which tripped on this locking mess. There was
flush_workqueue and also more recently preempt version of rcu.
	flush_workqueue()
		mutex_lock(&hotplug_lock);	/* we can sleep below */
		for_each_online_cpu()
			flush_cpu_workqueue();
		mutex_unlock(&hotplug_lock);
First problem with this snippet was that a workqueue function for which
we are waiting to be flushed may want to take the same hotplug_lock,
which can deadlock (see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/6/352
 for
description of this).
Second problem was : keventd is running flush_workqueue() and one of the
work functions calls flush_workqueue() again which is an attempt to take
hotplug_lock() recursively.
Partly the situation is complex because of the intertwining of
so many subsystem around this one lock. In all cases, encoding two version of
a function, one which takes the hotplug_lock and the other which doesnt take,
is probably an option. IMHO that would just make the source too ugly and
difficult to audit for cpu hotplug safety.
Best would be to go for a lock which supports recursion (and which
avoids other problems inherent with the old mutex based lock) or as
Andrew insisted with the freezer.
