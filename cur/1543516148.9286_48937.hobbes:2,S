the default gdb that comes with rh61, i.e. 4.18. Btw, I recompiled 2.3.28
cleanly making sure that everything is -g'd and it works now :)
must have been a user error and I am very reluctant to go back to earlier
version to verify - all is well that ends well :)
(besides I am busy debugging this new and exciting "kmod requests
binfmt-0000" bug in 2.3.28 so "info scope" can wait)

Tigran.
