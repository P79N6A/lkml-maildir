In this context PnP is refering to configuration of system and ISA
devices.  PnPBIOS support should be safe but faults on boot for a few
buggy systems.  Because the recovery code has been fixed, this should
be less of a problem.  If you see a message indicating that a pnp
device was activated as the parport driver loads then you need PnPBIOS
support to properly use it.  If not, then PnPBIOS will still aid in the
device's detection process.

If you are using PnPBIOS support then set PNP OS to "yes", otherwise use
"no".

Yes, see sysfs and drivers/pnp/interface.c.  Resources can be reallocated
but only if the device is not bound to a driver (modules are useful for this).
