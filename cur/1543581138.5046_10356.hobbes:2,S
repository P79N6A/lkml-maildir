Unlikely to be either of those. My guess is its the reiserfs stuff interacting
with the 2.2 VM code badly. 2.2.19pre8 fixes the VM behaviour in the general
case and that might well make it handle the extra vm pressure reiserfs causes
Certainly I'd try 2.2.19pre3 or higher. I don't think its hardware or
reiserfs problems
