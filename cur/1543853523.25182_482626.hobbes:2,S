Well, the value can be changed at any time, so you could be using a 
temporary fscreate value, or your new value could be overwritten 
immediately by writing to /proc/$$/attr/fscreate
I think we need to add a separate field for this purpose, which can only 
be written to via the in-kernel API and overrides fscreate.
