For maintenance and testing purposes, I think it's still better to make
it conditional. If the errata are fixed, you might want to kill the
condition depending on the stepping, for example. During the transition
time, you need to support both the steppings until old ones go away
(then remove the workaround).
Thanks,
Jun
