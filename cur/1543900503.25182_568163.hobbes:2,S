The earlier patches in this series change the linker script to place it
appropriately and set the phdr.  It's allocated when its input sections are
allocated.  Current builds I've seen don't have any input note sections at
all.  My motivation is for the ld --build-id support, which generates an
allocated note section as if it were input.

What note generation do you mean?  The only explicit notes in asm that I
know of are in the vDSO images, not in vmlinux.  This patch has nothing to
do with any vDSO image's generation.
