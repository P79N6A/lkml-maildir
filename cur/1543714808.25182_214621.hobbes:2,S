Or even call the attribute "nonnull", because this is a very obvious
naming, even to non-native English readers.
"safe" can mean anything from "safe to use under spinlock" to
"you cannot get pregnant from using this variable".
GCC will not only optimize out the check, but also ensure that the we
will not pass NULL ptrs, if it can notice it. If this gets pushed high
enough (up to the register-like functions, where it gets first
assigned), we will never face this kind of problem anymore and document
this fact per function. Sounds like C coder heaven ;-)
