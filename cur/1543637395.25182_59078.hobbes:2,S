Hi,
I did some more testing, and to my great surprise found that one of my 
ram sticks was dead. This is what seems to have been causing the
corruption.
Hopefully (because I just re-installed) it won't corrupt any more,
but I will still try out this patch. This patch looks like it fixes the
VIA 8367, which is on the Asus A7V333 board, not the a7v266 (my) board.
However, coincidentally I happen to be receiving the A7V333 board 
tomorow :) So I will test the patch when I install the new board.
For the other people with the corruption, did you alter the pci latency 
in the bios?
