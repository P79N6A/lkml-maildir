Why? Programs that don't use streams won't ever try to do it, a
nd won't even query to see if there _are_ streams on a file.

I'm not playing dumb. It seems like people making the 
"implement as directories" arguments actually don't want 
any streams support at all. I'm arguing honestly: I want 
streams support for filesystems that use them. I don't 
want to break existing programs to get it. I think a 
namespace extension is the proper way to do it. I
_think_ I understand what you're trying to say, and 
it's this:
"streams are stupid and I don't want linux to support them"
Please correct me if I am wrong. I am _not_ just trying to flame you.

Tar can work. Its format supports EAs. The tools may not, but that's
fixable.
