Well the keventd handler would simply process all currently-queued
messages.  It's not as if you'd only process one event per keventd callout.

Why does insert performance matter so much?  These things still have to be
sent up to userspace.
(please remind me why cbus exists, btw.  What functionality does it offer
which the connector code doesn't?)

keventd should process all the currently-queued messages.  If messages are
being queued quickly then that will be a lot of messages on each keventd
callout.

I don't understand your terminology.  What is "peak processing" and how
does it differ from maximum insertion rate?

An up-to-ten-millisecond latency between the kernel-side queueing of a
message and the delivery of that message to userspace sounds like an
awfully bad restriction to me.  Even one millisecond will have impact in
some scenarios.

OK, so why does it matter that "If too many deferred insert works will be
called [which may happen with keventd] it will slow down insert operations
noticeably"?
There's no point in being able to internally queue messages at a higher
frequency than we can deliver them to userspace.  Confused.

Yes, there's batching there.  But I don't understand why the ability to
internally queue events at a high rate is so much more important than the
latency which that batching will introduce.
(And keventd _does_ allow such batching.  schedule_delayed_work()).
