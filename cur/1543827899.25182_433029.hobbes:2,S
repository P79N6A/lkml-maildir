Hi,
A few of us at Oracle have been reviewing the Ubuntu kernel git tree
to see what "extra" patches they are using that might make sense in
the mainline kernel.
I'll be posting these for comments/consideration etc. in no particular
order (over a period of days, not all at one time).
Thanks,
~Randy
