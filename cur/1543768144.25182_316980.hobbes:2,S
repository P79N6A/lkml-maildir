The values in the other fields are asumed to be ignored if the ID is 0.
Therefore, some people store their company name there, which, interpreted
as a partition address, results e.g. in overlapping partitions.
If there is a automounter, this bogus partition will be mounted, and if
it happens to look like having a valid filesystem, this will result in
data corruption or crashes.
