Yes, as I said in the first mail :

 >(Tests done on a dual Xeon i386 and a dual Opteron x86_64)
On the dual opteron machine, with 40.000 packets coming per second, and 35.000 
sent per second, the numbers were : 12.8 % before the patches, 4.4 % after the 
patches.
I dont have separate perf measurements for each patch.
Considering the fact that I inlined the read_lock_bh() call (not displayed in 
oprofile results, probably because of the special .spinlock.text section) that 
should have increased the profile of ipt_do_table(), thats a lot of CPU cycles 
  and mem bandwitdh that are available for other jobs.
