Hello; thanks for the info, I did revert the nopage back into the
kernel, but after all of that, I'm confronted with
the module not being a GPL-only module  `init_pid_ns'.
I've looked in kernel/pid.c and am noticing  EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(init_pid_ns);
With that in mind I'm more concerned about the module not being
GPL-only, is this in full enforcement, or just a thaught
that irritated a bunch of people.
regards;
