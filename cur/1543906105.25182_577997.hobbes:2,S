Since you are playing with /proc/interrupts, is there any chance you
could make it make sense too?
Right now I have the annoying issue that /proc/interrupts only shows
interrupts that it sees a handler for, and ignores the rest.  For some
reason irq 3 never shows up in /proc/interrupts on my system, even
though I have serial ports on both IRQ 3 and 4.  Only irq 4 shows
'serial' as the handler, and is the only one shown.  irq 3 is getting
lots of interrupts, and the serial driver is handling them, it just
doesn't show up in /proc/interrupts.  procinfo does show irq 3 although
with no handler listed.  I think any interrupt with a handler AND any
interrupt with a non zero count ought to be shown.  I only happened to
try procinfo by chance and discover that while I thought IRQ 3 wasn't
working, the only issue was that /proc/interrupts simply wasn't showing
all the relevant information.
Of course I would also love to know why irq 3 isn't showing serial as
the handler, but I have no idea why that is.  This is all using Debian's
2.6.18 kernel.
