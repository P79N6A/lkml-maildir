I have the task of porting an existing file system to Linux. This  
code is in C++ and I have noticed that the Linux kernel has
made use of C++ keywords and other things that make it incompatible.
I would be most willing to point out the areas that need adjustment  
and supply patch files to be reviewed.
What would be the best procedure to accomplish this?
