How can I configure my system to use a search path for the program 
interpreter specified in the ELF .interp section? I'm looking for the same 
behavior there is for $PATH and simple executing, so I can put something 
like "ld-linux.so" in .interp and have it find that file if it is not in 
the CWD at the time of execution.
