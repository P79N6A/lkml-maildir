Hi Everyone,
With out the test above an id beyond the allocated space will alias
to one that exists.  Perhaps the highest id currently allocated is 
100, there will be two layers in the radix tree and the while loop
above will only look at the 10 least significant bits.  If you call
idr_find with 1025 it will return the pointer associated with id 1.
The patch I sent was against linux-2.6.7, so I missed the change to
MAX_ID_SHIFT.
