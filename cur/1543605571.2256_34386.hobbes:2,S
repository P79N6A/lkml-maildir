How would hiding that information make the system "easier to use" ?   They
can't interact with the boot process anyway - but they can call their sysadmin
and say "it said 'kernel panic'" and he can make them read up the last few
lines on the screen.
I've done that successfully with the mail-relay/proxy/router/fileserver at my
parent's house, with my mother at the keyboard ! She writes books about gardens
for a living.  If all she could tell me was "well there's a penguin with a line
under it that doesn't move", I'd be pretty stuck.
Really, treating people like idiots will get you idiots.  I don't believe there
are that many idiots around - but some computer litterates seem to have the
idea that computer illiterates are best treated as drooling morons. Those poor
people will never know, because they never get a chance.   This is *not* doing
them a favour.
 "User friendliness is often confused
  with designing software for idiots"
    - me  ;)
Now don't think that I'm against nice user interfaces.  Not at all.  I'm just
against over-protecting people from the real world.   Don't hide generally
useful information, that's all.
