	But theoreticaly user may need more than 256 Unicode symbols.

	In experementations with console driver at home I add this possibility
as one aditional TIOCLINUX ioctl as well as reading of current translation.

	We have codeset to Unicode translation tables in current kernel.
So no additions not needed.

	Yes, this is not gpm work. gpm use selection from kernel. And 
paste in UTF mode possible in current kernel with very small patch. But
in current kernel you can print one UTF symbol, and paste from selection
another just because selection work from screen glyphs.
