I already do something like this, although not for thousands
of users, but I guess this would scale well ...
consider a storage device (maybe a partition) for each 
category of data you want to store/provide/serve
/mnt/webspace, /mnt/database, /mnt/email, /mnt/wossname ...
now each data space gets subdirectories for logical
groupings (optional) and a second level for the actual
users ... there could be other layers like domains for 
example too ...
/mnt/webspace/customer/charlie
/mnt/webspace/customer/jack
/mnt/webspace/customer/wossname
and, if required, the same structure for database, email, ...
so you end up with totally separate storage trees, which
can be easily mounted/exported/shared with the apropriate
servers, now for the conceptional grouping, where the 
customer wants to have all the data in one place ...
on the access server (where the customer maintains the data)
you'll end up mounting all the storage categories, required
for access and you do an additional restructuring for each
customer (which of course is automated)
/home/customer/charlie is populated with symlinks to
/mnt/*/customer/charlie named by category
/home/customer/charlie/webspace -> /mnt/webspace/customer/charlie
/home/customer/charlie/email -> /mnt/email/customer/charlie
...
this also has the advantage that any kind of service change
(for example changing the webspace) can be simply done by 
modifying the symlinks ...

this is covered by the suggested approach.

no, I don't ...
