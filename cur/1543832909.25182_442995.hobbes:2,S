I don't remember the case exactly - original OSS as stated in pdf describing
its behaviour locks buffer size after some ioctls. So you can't change parameters
unless you do reset or reopen the device. aoss does it differently.
Also aoss has no mixer ioctls working with audio stream fd implemented.

That is true but it is a process (thread exactly but in Linux world it is a special kind of process) so it can be scheduled down or swapped off.

If I have enough resources to do this in kernel space and obtain good results
why not do it?

There was reports of jack mixing problems with dmix active. Proposed solution was to use jack attached directly to alsa hw device and not to the default.

Of course.
As I said it could be done by a small kernel message passing redirector connected
to a bloated user space RT process which does the rest. But some kernel support for proper waking up, rescheduling etc. is a must.
