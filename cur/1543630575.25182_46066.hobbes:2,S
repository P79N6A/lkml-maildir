Hi Rik,
Since you are working on this piece of kernel,
I was investigating why sometimes in top I see idle % like
9384729374923.43%. It was caused by idle count in /proc/stat
going backward sometimes.
I found the race responsible for that and have a fix for it
(attached below). It checks for jiffies change and regenerate
stats if jiffies++ hit us.
Unfortunately it is for UP case only, in SMP race still exists,
even on SMP kernel on UP box.
Why: system/user/idle[/iowait] stats are collected at timer int
on UP but _on local APIC int_ on SMP.
It can be fixed for SMP:
* add spinlock
or
* add per_cpu_idle, account it too at timer/APIC int
  and get rid of idle % calculations for /proc/stat
As a user, I vote for glitchless statistics even if they
consume extra i++ cycle every timer int on every CPU.
Now you hear very first scream :-)
