I've done some more testing, this time including the low memory case. 
For low memory testing I built the dhcp server from SRPM in 8MB with X,
xdm, various daemons (sendmail, named, inetd, etc.), and vmstat 1
running.  Swap area stayed at about 8MB usage.  I have also run the
128MB tests some more and have slightly more accurate results.  Here is
the summary:
