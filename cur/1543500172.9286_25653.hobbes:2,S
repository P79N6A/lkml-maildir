Yes. Where is the problem? We already do this. As I understood, you
don't put the data file formats in the kernel but a loadable
abstraction layer which allows one application to use resource forks
and another one a representation as dot-files, subdirectories, you
name it. I would consider this a "cool thing (TM)".
