I was talking only about the CONFIG_SMP thing here. BTW, for other things you
could use the compiler too (instead of the preprocessor) if you really
wanted to.
The new way does:
	if (SMP_KERNEL && ...)
		xxx
instead of:
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	if (...)
		xxx
#endif
I don't see a big advantage in the first version (and it may waste stack). I
could see advantages if the SMP_KERNEL would be in the middle of a very complex
check, but the above usage wasn't the case.

It can if the hardware fails. If hardware doesn't fail, also wake_up alomost
can't fail in the same way of queue_task.

The runqueue_lock is completly unrelated to doing the wakeup in timer_bh.
runqueue_lock simply needs to be added to the bust_spinlocks() list so
we can see oops from schedule() in SMP.

Of course you can skip some wakeup with multiple printk at high frequency but
that has also the side effect that it will overflow the log buffer more easily
and that's not good either.

As said I think if wake_up can oops, queue_task can oops as well, so I don't
see a real advantage in the !oops_in_progress.

Thanks, I'll check it in some more time but so far it looks very good after a
short look ;)).
