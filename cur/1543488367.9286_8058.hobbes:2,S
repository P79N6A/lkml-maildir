Is the Crystal chipset 4837 supported? I have had limited sucess using the
crystal drivers,  but i have a loud pop whenever the card starts to play music
from mp3s. I also cannot get linux to recognize the joystick either. I am using
2.2.1 on a Suse 6.0 machine. Should I just deal with the problems, or whould I
upgrade the kernel. Modules vs. in kernel. Switches or other configureations
that should be used, maybe in conjunction with the module loading.
Any help would be much appreciated.
