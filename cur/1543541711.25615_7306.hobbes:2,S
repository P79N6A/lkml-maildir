First the limit is per file system, not per file system per user.
Better forbid the users mmap and TCP/unix sockets then, because they can
easily pin more memory for their socket buffers or page tables (similar to 
a lot of other subsystems) As long as there is no bean counter every user 
can relatively easy tie up arbitary amounts of memory in Linux. Alternatively 
you have to set their process/fd descriptors so low to make the machine 
unusable for the user:
e.g. 64K socket buffer per fd, you want to limit it to 5MB max/user 
5MB / 64K = 80 sockets. So you give them 10 processes with 8 file descriptors
each or 8 processes with 10 file descriptors? How many of the programs
your users use will still run with such low limits?
The only more or less reliable way currently to prevent local DoS by users 
is to separate them in UML virtual machines.
