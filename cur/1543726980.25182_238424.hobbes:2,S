 Well, I did a cleanup in the cloop code, merged it in 2.6.7, and
enabled it in Kconfig:
 The patch is here:
http://www.telecentros.sp.gov.br/capitulino/patches/linux/2.6/cloop/2.6.7/
 I did it for another project some weeks ago, sorry for not posting
it here before (But, as far as I can remember, I sent it to knopper).
PS: Its a patch again't the kernel, you will have to get the standard
tools from knopper page.
 Hope it helps,
