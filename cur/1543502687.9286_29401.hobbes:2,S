Who is the original poster?
If they have any EMails to back their claim from Promise, I would like a
copy so I can call (K^2) directly and ask him and the guys in Taiwan.

I have submitted your bug report.  Promise is not willing to release the
necessary information to make a Linux driver for this card.

==========================================
Hi, Andre,
How do you do ?
My name is <deleted name>.
I am <deleted name>'s colleague.
I am puzzled how to program linux driver.
Could i ask you a favor in some questions ?
in   Linux : Red Hat 5.x
1.  What library ( .o .a .so .... ) is default library in linux ?
2.  How to know functions which use in our source code
                mapping to which library that  must be linked it ?
     ex: <linux/bios32.h>
           pcibios_find_device()        ------>       ??? .a
Thanks!!
Bast Regards
