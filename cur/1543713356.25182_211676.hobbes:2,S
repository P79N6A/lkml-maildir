Especially since the VM layer has no concept of COW except for private
anonymous pages.  Which does not map to a POSIX cow on files.

Either that your you call fsync(file) as part of generating the cow
copy.

If you don't flush things to disk first there are certainly some sharing
issues.  Flushing the data to the address_space of the shared inode
should work just as well though.
What you must have is a clear state change from caching a normal file
to cache a cow file.  Where certain parts of the behavior changes.
What this needs to do depends on the VFS at the time.  
If sharing is introduced past that state change things get tricky to
manage.  I just don't want to think about those issues just now...
