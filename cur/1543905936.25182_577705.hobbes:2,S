 I still have doubts. The removal of /etc/mtab is nice, but a little
 unreal wish. Do we really want to store non-kernel data (options) in
 kernel? What about options that are not closely related to any
 filesystem -- for example "loop="?
 Maybe we can replace /etc/mtab with something more useful
 (e.g. /var/run/mount/<mntid>.tab) for really user-space-only information.
 It doesn't mean that Miklos's audit of all filesystems and request
 for patches is bad thing. The /proc/mounts has to provide complete
 information at least about kernel mount options.
