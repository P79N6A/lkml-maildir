Will try to test when we have time. 
So, can we agree on: 
	- might be needed for 
		- Floppies?
		- MO drives
		- older drives
Can we auto-detect these cases (Linus doesn't like configurable
parameters that need tweaking to work well, and I agree: 99% of the
users want to have stuff that works (well) out of the box.)
How about we set the num-retries to 1, and increase to 8 for
"weird devices" (floppy, MO), and older drives. 
How do we detect: "Older drives"? Would "MFM": the user specified the
geometry" be valid as a detection of "older drive"?
Or do we want to include the 40Mb-1G generation drives as well? How
do we detect those if we want to include them? 
I do want to make the num_retries thing a configurable parameter,
should the autodetect get it wrong: We get drives that we want to
recover without the kernel-level retries...
(still: I argue that you need to consider a "retry-works" error as an
early warning that your media is going bad, and you need to get your
data off ASAP! If the kernel silently retries and succeeds, the user
won't notice a thing and continue using the drive (or MO media) until
the error becomes irrecoverable. I recommend we put the retry at the
user level. As in "person behind keyboard".)
I'll try to make a patch as long as we work towards a feature set
first.... 
	Roger.
