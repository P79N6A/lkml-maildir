Not the same problem.  The significant difference in the maps is :-

__sched_text_start has moved up by 1 byte between pass 1 and 2.  Text
addresses are not allowed to move between kallsyms passes, kallsyms
only adds data, it never touches the text segment.  Paulo's change to
the working set hides this peculiarity, rather than fixing the real
cause.  This looks like a toolchain bug, it is moving symbols for no
good reason.
