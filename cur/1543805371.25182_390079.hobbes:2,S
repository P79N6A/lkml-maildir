Well, to some extent it depends on your access patterns. The backup
program I use (`dar') is an enormous memory hog: it happily eats 5Gb on
my main fileserver (an UltraSPARC, so compiling it 64-bit does away with
address space sizing problems). That machine has only 512Mb RAM, so
you'd expect the thing would be swapping to death; but the backup
program's locality of reference is sufficiently good that it doesn't
swap much at all (and that in one tight lump at the end).
