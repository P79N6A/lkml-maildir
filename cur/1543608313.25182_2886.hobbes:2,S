yup, but see the cooler man (if it has one). Some of them are rated for
< 70C - above that they stop and melt (in whatever order).

see Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:
ide0=nodma ide1=nodma
should do.
The following is on my K7S5A (no onboard eth):
# hdparm -tT /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.53 seconds =241.51 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.82 seconds = 35.16 MB/sec
kernel is 2.2.19-xxx from RH, but when I tested it performed the same
under 2.4.x. Its uptime is only 9 days, but no problems so far. It's
a NFS, samba, SMTP, IMAP, HTTP server, not heavily loaded.

Mine doesn't have an eth on board. Have you tried and disabled it?
