Subject: [PATCH] Remove 'volatile' from spinlocks

Hi.
Months ago two patches were posted by Ingo Molnar that removed
the 'volatile' keyword from the 'raw_spinlock_t' and 'raw_rwlock_t'
structures in the i386 and x86-64 ports. The link below takes you to
the initial (?) posting of the patches:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=115217423929806&w=2
I've been build and running SMP kernels on a dual PIII machine with
the i386 version of the patch since then and the kernels have worked
well. Perhaps the patch(es) can make it into the 2.6.20 kernel?
The i386 version of the patch is below, the x86-64 patch is identical.
