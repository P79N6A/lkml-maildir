You're right. Not only that, but "TASK_NONINTERACTIVE" is special in that 
it's an _additional_ flag to the task state, not an independent flag at 
all.
Ie it's _really_ only valid as a bitmask.
So I think we're better off reverting that ordering change, and testing 
the bitmap properly.

Correct again.
Btw, that brings up another thing: those EXIT_ZOMBIE/EXIT_DEAD flags are 
really really confusing. 
It's two different words, but the way we use them in get_task_state(), 
they are or'ed together, which is why they need to have non-overlapping 
bit definitions. But there's no comment about that anywhere.
I'll add a comment to <linux/sched.h> about it.
Thanks,
