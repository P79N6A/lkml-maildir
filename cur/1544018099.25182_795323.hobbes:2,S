The point was the -Os disables it typically then.
(not always, compiler heuristics are far from perfect)

L2 cache is so much slower that scheduling a few instructions
more doesn't help much.

Hmm, but if the load is nearby it won't matter if a 
store is in the middle, because the CPU will just execute
over it.
The real big win is if you do some computation inbetween,
but at least for typical list manipulation there isn't 
really any.

Frankly I think it would be another unlikely().
