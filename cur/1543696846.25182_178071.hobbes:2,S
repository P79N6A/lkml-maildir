I think it's useful to maintain bass-ackwards compatibility with
root=, especially since if any hack is put it now, it creates new
legacy.
Looking for init, or linuxrc, inside the initramfs makes sense.  It
should *NOT* be tied to the init= option, though... consider when all
of this is pulled out of kernel space; you don't want "init=" to break
finding your RAID volumes when you're trying to find a different
"real" init binary.
Having a kinit= option (or earlyinit= or whatever, kinit seems to be
the term we have been using) would be another matter, of course.
