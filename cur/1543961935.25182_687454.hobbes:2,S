Ok, I found a way to simulate the error here. Just doing:
	rm  /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/media/common/tuners/*
Produced the same OOPS.
The fix is easy: just removing the unregister function call. dvb_register
happens only at videobuf-dvb, that happens only if no error during attach. So,
the proper deallocation code is just calling dvb_detach.
By removing this, and the tuner modules, now no oops is generated:

There's one missing patch on your tree that will make it work again. I'm
enclosing it at the end of this email.
I've updated my -git tree with those patches. The same bug were also present on
em28xx-dvb and cx88-dvb (that have about the same code). 
The fixes for those bugs are available at my -git tree. I've already sent a
pull request for their merge.
Cheers,
Mauro.

fix drivers/media/common/tuners/ build bug
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
x86.git randconfig testing found a build failure on latest -git:
 drivers/built-in.o: In function `set_type':

with the following config:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/config-Wed_Apr_30_10_21_40_CEST_2008.bad
the problem is caused by the drivers/media/common/tuners/ subdirectory
not being part of the kbuild hierarchy anymore, due to commit
7c91f0624 ("V4L/DVB(7767): Move tuners to common/tuners").
this seems similar to the problem also reported by Mike Galbraith.
