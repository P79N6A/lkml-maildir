however... mlocked pages still can be dirty, and want to be written back
at some point ;)
I can see the point of doing dirty ratio as percentage of the LRU size,
but in that case you don't need to track NR_MLOCK, only the total LRU
size. (And yes it'll be sometimes optimistic because not all mlock'd
pages are moved off the lru yet, but I doubt you'll have that as a
problem in practice)
