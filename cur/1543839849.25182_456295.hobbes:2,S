Any objection to something like that ? (And of course fixing the few
drivers for the name change)
 struct msix_entry {
-        u16     vector; /* kernel uses to write allocated vector */
+        unsigned int     irq; /* kernel uses to write allocated
interrupt */
         u16     entry;  /* driver uses to specify entry, OS writes */
 };
Maybe x86 has a 1:1 hw vector <-> linux irq numbers (does it btw ?) but
other archs certainly don't. pci_enable_msix API should return a linux
IRQ number for the driver to pass to request_irq(), certainly not a hw
vector number, and the normal type for an irq is unsigned int :)
If it's ok, I'll do a patch changing that and fixing all in-tree users.
Ben.
