I quick test with a PowerPC kernel and the normal vmlinux image reveals
that this is nonsense. 
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      2766490 2003-09-27 22:29 vmlinux
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      1149410 2003-09-27 22:29 vmlinux.gz
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root      1062999 2003-09-27 22:29 vmlinux.bz2
This is a 86411 bytes or 8.1% reduction, seems significant to me...
Granted, it takes 9 times as long to decompress the kernel and ca. 900kb
more memory but considering an embedded DSL router I'm working with
which has 16MB RAM but only 4MB Flash this is certainly worth it. At
least when the target is an embedded device.
