I'm running 2.6.17-ck1 on this machine (x86-64, single core), I've 
bruned a few DVDs yesterday (using growisofs). My guess is either that 
some SMP thingy causes it (don't think it's likely though), or (and I 
hope you're not using ~amd64 in /etc/make.conf - that *will* break 
things ;) it's some ~amd64 package.
My tools are:
=app-cdr/dvd+rw-tools-5.21.4.10.8  # (<- this one provies growisofs)
=app-cdr/cdrtools-2.01.01_alpha07
other than that the only thing I can think of right now would be "need 
to be root" (or something like g+rw for the dvd-device)

After all, if you are in school to study computer science, then a professor
saying "use this proprietary software to learn computer science" is the
same as English professor handing you a copy of Shakespeare and saying
"use this book to learn Shakespeare without opening the book itself."
