Let's keep currents splits as they are. (core-lite, i386-lite, core, i386, 
x86_64, ppc, 8250, eth) It's very tempting to start merging, but that makes 
it difficult to modify only a few of them and eventually user won't have the 
choice of selecting only those that are needed.

I have a different opinion. Ideally these patches are best kept completely 
independent of each other. We may not be able to achieve that all the time. 
Right now we have following order of patches. [core-lite, i386-lite, 
8250][core, i386, x86_64, eth]. Second set depends on first. Patches in each 
set are independent of each other. We anyway have this dependency because of 
lite patches. So 8250 dependency should be ok.
