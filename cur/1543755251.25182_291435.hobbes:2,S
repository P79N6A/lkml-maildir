I don't think this can really happen (at least not on the bootstrap CPU) 
because even if an SMI occurs, the CPU must first serve the timer 
interrupt and increment jiffies before it continues looping.
However "LPJ too short" is what needs to be avoided at all cost.
Regards and thanks for working on this problem,
