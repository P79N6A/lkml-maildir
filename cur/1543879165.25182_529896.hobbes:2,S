Before maybe freeing the page, the kernel checks the referenced
and dirty bits of the page table entries mapping that page.

All this call does is:
- clear the accessed and dirty bits
- move the page to the far end of the inactive list,
   where it will be the first to be reclaimed

Two things can happen here.
If this program used the pages before the kernel needed
them, the program will be reusing its old pages.
If the kernel got there first, you will get page faults
and the kernel will fill in the memory with new pages.
Both of these alternatives are transparent to userspace.
