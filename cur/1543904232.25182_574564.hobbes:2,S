which only finds executables that are in the path.
I commonly use locate to find config files (or sample config files) for 
packages that were installed at some point in the past with fairly default 
configs and now I want to go and tweak them. so I start reading 
documentation and then need to find out where $disto moved the files to 
this release (I commonly am working on machines with over a half dozen 
different distro releases, and none of them RedHat)
