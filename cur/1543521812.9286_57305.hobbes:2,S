Although it does not affect me where I live, these two subsections are
the outcome of a twisted mind. You may not export things to the
countries named in (2), but you may publicly offer the stuff for im- and
export (download). Subtlety: with active FTP, you actually have your FTP
server export things. %-) 
Thus, (3) effectively swallows (2), both paragraphs could safely be
omitted.
