Unfortunately (exactly because of the same guarantees you're asking for 
those handles), in order for userspace libraries to reliably internally 
use fds to interact with the kernel, you need another kind of allocation 
strategy.

It does not work. What if the main application, library A and library B 
wants to implement their own allocation strategy?
