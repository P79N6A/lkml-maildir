    Oh I could deal with all of the problems as well.  But after a good bit
of recompiling, patching, upgrading, backtracking the things done in the
"Redhat" way which many times don't match the man pages, as well as undoing
the "Redhat" way annoyances I just end up with a variation of my own hand
built distribution.  And once I have to replace the system experimental C
library and compiler it just get even more ridicules.

    I know.  Please don't remind me of UnixWare.  I buried that at my
clients' and companies' sites in the Linux 1.2.x days.

    Well here's hoping that 7.2 is smooth and polished.  Especially since
Redhat has become the defacto standard and I'll probably be trying it out
again.

    I never keep it around for long after I saw it crash a couple of times
on my first 7.0 or 7.1 box so I can't say much about its stability.  Besides
it was more the principal of the thing.  Why in the world use the alpha
version of a text editor when a perfectly good released version exists with
pretty much the same functionality.  One thing I did notice, if I remember
correctly.  Seamed that either the installed vim was crippled or had a bug
in reading my customized .vimrc file.  My custom options didn't get loaded
until I downloaded the latest 5.[89] source and recompiled myself a new
version.
