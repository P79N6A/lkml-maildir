futex(FUTEX_LOCK_PI).

Which users?

No, it is restricted because I cannot express something like an absolute 
timeout/deadline.  If the parameter would be a struct timespec* then at 
any time we can implement either relative timeouts w/ and w/out 
observance of settimeofday/ntp and absolute timeouts.  This is what 
makes the interface generic and unrestricted while your current version 
cannot be used for the latter.

It is about atomicity wrt to the signal mask manipulation which would 
have to precede the kevent_wait call and the call itself (and 
registering a signal for kevent delivery).  This is not atomic.

There are a myriad of different scenarios, it makes no sense to pick 
one.  The interface must be generic to cover them all, I don't know how 
often I have to repeat this.

The order is unimportant.  You change the signal mask, for instance, if 
the time when a thread is waiting in poll() is the only time when a 
signal can be handled.  Or vice versa, it's the time when signals are 
not wanted.  And these are per-thread decisions.
Signal handlers and kevent registrations for signals are process-wide 
decisions.  And furthermore: with kevent delivered signals there is no 
signal mask anymore (at least you seem to not check it).  Even if this 
would be done it doesn't change the fact that you cannot use signals the 
way many programs want to.
Fact is that without a signal queue you cannot implement the above 
cases.  You cannot block/unblock a signal for a specific thread.  You 
also cannot work together with signals which cannot be delivered through 
kevent.  This is the case for existing code in a program which happens 
to use also kevent and it is the case if there is more than one possible 
recipient.  With kevent signals can be attached to one kevent queue only 
but the recipients (different threads or only different parts of a 
program) need not use the same kevent queue.
I've said from the start that you cannot possibly expect that programs 
are not using signal delivery in the current form.  And the complete 
loss of blocking signals for individual threads makes the kevent-based 
signal delivery incomplete (in a non-fixable form) anyway.

This really has nothing to do with the problem.

Surely you don't suggest keeping your original timer patch?

What is the "maximum allowed"?  ENOSYS must be returned for all values 
which could potentially in future be used as a valid type value.  If you 
limit the values which are treated this way you are setting a fixed 
upper limit for the type values which _ever_ can be used.

I've told you, then don't work on these parts.  I'll get the changes I 
think are needed implemented by somebody else or I'll do it myself.  If 
you say that only those you implement something have a say in the way 
this is done then this is fine with me.  But you have to realize that 
you're not the one who will make all the final decisions.
