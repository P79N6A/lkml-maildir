I'm not sure about the locking here.  What happens if the task starts
exitting immediately after the above test?
Plus the above adds code to the delivery fastpath, rather than exit().
If we're going to do the above for other reasons (what are they?) then it
would be neater to add a new PF_NO_SIGNALS rather than overloading PF_DEAD.
