I notice that you're using fbcon from your dmesg.  There was a
discussion about this a while back, and it was determined that fbcon
runs with interrupts disabled for unhealthily long period of time.  This
causes it to miss timer interrupts, and the system lock get behind.  See
if this slowdown occurs with vgacon.  If it does, its probably just a
cheap crystal on the motherboard.
