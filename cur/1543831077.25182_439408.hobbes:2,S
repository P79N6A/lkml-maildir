I don't think it makes sense to complicate the software if the
hardware already guarantees it. So please remove it.
If there is ever an PMU which ticks in C states you could readd
it, but it would surprise me if that will ever happen because
it would conflict with power saving.
Actually there is one reason to use idle notifiers anyways for the PMU -
it can be used to correct for the not ticking PMU in C. So e.g. 
you could synthesize an artificial counter out of CPU_CLK_UNHALTED
(and equivalents) + RDTSC measurements before/after idle
(+ correcting the overflows for lost time). With that people
can get full accounting including idle without doing nasty
things like idle=poll
I wanted to do that for oprofile at some point but never got
around to it. But that was one of the reasons the idle notifiers
got added.
But without that I don't think you should special case idle
at all.

s390 has it too (I stole it from there) Others could add it I guess
if there is a good case.
