   Half of an hour - works without problems.
   Thanks.
   [ I am using exactly usb-uhci. "Works For Me" (tm) without any 
parameters. ]
   [ I have spend more time to f*ck up RHL9 to load automatically alsa. 
And bit more time to figure-out that RHL start-up scripts do screw 
things up completely. gamix, alsamixer do work, but xmms fails to open 
alsa's dsp. "rmmod snd*; modprobe sound-slot-0" in late start-up helped. 
Need to upgrade my RHL9 to Debian...
    Too old for this /desktop/ non-sense.
    But still I am (as a device driver developer) trying to understand 
how it is possible to screw something in module loading process so mixer 
is here but dsp is not, while they are represented by the very same 
module. ]

  Because the kernel depends on it existing. "init"          |_|*|_|
  literally _is_ special from a kernel standpoint,           |_|_|*|
  because its' the "reaper of zombies" (and, may I add,      |*|*|*|
  that would be a great name for a rock band).
