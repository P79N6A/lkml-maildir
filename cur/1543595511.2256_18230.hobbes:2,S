I haven't had a chance to analyze the directory index format to see if
an-dirindexing-ignorant e2fsck could do any damage to the index.  It's
probably the case as long as the filesystem isn't corrupted, simply
modifying e2fsck to ignore the compatibility flag won't hurt.  But
it's certainly not something I would recommend for any kind of
production operation.
