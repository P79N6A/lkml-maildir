I don't know if this helps, but this is the message tar spits out when 
this problem occurs:
/bin/tar: home/pedro/COL&AMk-TA: Read error at byte 21958656, reading 
10240 byte: Input/output error

Hmmm... I have no idea!  I know that "host 0 channel 0 id 1 lun 0" 
refers to the new Atlas HD, and I know that I have another HD with id 0, 
and that the tape drive is id 3.  I do not know how to interpret 
"sd08:11", suggestions?
Maybe 'sd08' refers to the block device number?
[root@office sysadm]# cat /proc/devices
[snip]
Block devices:
   2 fd
   7 loop
   8 sd
  22 ide1
  65 sd
  66 sd
So, one of the three SCSI devices uses block 8... but which?  I don't know.

Okay, good idea.  I will recompile setting those symbols, but I will not 
be able to do so until after the machine is idle (>5PM tonight).  BTW, 
these are my current SCSI symbol defs:
CONFIG_SCSI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y
CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS=40
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_ST=y
# CONFIG_CHR_DEV_OSST is not set
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SR is not set
# CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_DEBUG_QUEUES=y
CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN=y
CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS=y
# CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING is not set
CONFIG_SCSI_AIC7XXX=y
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_CMDS_PER_DEVICE=253
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_RESET_DELAY_MS=15000
