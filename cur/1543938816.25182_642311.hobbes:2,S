The wakeup hook in schedule is when we find out that we hit our max. I
could postpone that somehow, but that would require more glue code than I
would like to add.
As for -rt, we've disabled printk for consoles not ATOMIC safe. So the
only consoles that will print in atomic sections so far are, earlyprintk
and the VGA.
Tim, could you send me your "postponed print" patches. That sounds like
something the -rt patch could use.
Thanks,
