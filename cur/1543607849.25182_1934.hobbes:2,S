I have no idea what you mean by "same error", but
let me repeat: if you think that anything is wrong,
then write to the manpage maintainer (aeb@cwi.nl)
and tell him precisely what you think is wrong and why.
Vague mutterings on a list like linux-kernel are unlikely
to improve anything, if, indeed, improvement is needed.
