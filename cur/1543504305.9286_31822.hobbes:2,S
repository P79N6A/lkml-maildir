I personally have no desire to write a program to interpret these
extended bytes, but should someone have that desire, the need to
extend the amount of bytes exported by /dev/nvram is there.
I see no reason why the limit shouldn't be increased. Unless there
is some flaky nvram that does strange things when you try to read
locations that it doesn't have, but I know of no such device.
btw, Is there a current maintainer of the nvram driver?
regards,
d.
