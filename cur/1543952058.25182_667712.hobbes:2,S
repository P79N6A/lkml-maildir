The problem as I understand it is that when we boot into the kdump
kernel we have left-over devices from the old kernel which are active
and initiating DMA's. This is fine as long as Calgayr is also active
(with the old kernel's mappings). Once we initialize Calgary (in the
kdump) kernel with the new mappings, however, it starts trapping all
those DMA's. We can't wait for them to stop, because that will only
happen when the device is re-initialized (or otherwise quiesced).
