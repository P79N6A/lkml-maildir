There are a few in Documentation/SubmitChecklist items 12 and 15.

You can be rather sure that there will be at least... questions and
concerns...  ;-)
Anyway, the root problem is that developers and integrators don't take
time to follow the rules in SubmitChecklist.  (I know that I still have
ways to go to improve my own processes in that regard.)  A Kconfig
switch may raise awareness of SubmitChecklist a little bit, but I'm
afraid it is not awareness what's the issue here.
