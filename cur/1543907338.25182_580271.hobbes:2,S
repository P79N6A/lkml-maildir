That's right. There's no way to know if userspace does handle the event
after reception, and that's why we have a timeout (so we don't wait
forever), but we can be sure that userspace won't handle an event that
wasn't received. We want to be conservative here: if there is any
chance that the event was received, we set the timeout and wait.

I don't know how common this is in general, but in my box it happens
(or rather happened, until I patched it) once per boot. I've got a
device that requires some firmware during initialisation. I always
build the driver into the kernel (I don't like modules for things
that are permanently attached to the computer), and that means that
it tries to initialise before the rootfs is mounted (there's no
initramfs). Before the patch, the kernel would hang for a minute
in request_firmware during each boot, which was rather annoying,
and that is the reason why I decided to fix it.
