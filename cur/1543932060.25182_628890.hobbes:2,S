other then the fact that this is bi-directional, how is this better then 
using pipes and splice?
wouldn't it be better to just add the ability for multiple writers to send 
to the same pipe, and then have all of them splice into the output of that 
pipe? this would give the same data-agnostic communication that you are 
looking for, and with the minor detail that software would have to filter 
out messages that they send, would appear to meet all the goals you are 
looking at, useing existing kernel features that are designed to be very 
high performance.
