Well it says they are slot 13 and 14.  What other pci devices are
present in the system and what irq's are they using?  Now it appears you
have acpi, and probably an apic on that board, which would explain
having IRQs higher than the 15 a plain old PC had.

Any documentation on that riser card?
I guess it is possible the card does something weird and the IRQs for
both cards have to actually be the same.  If that is the case you could
make the kernel change the IRQ assigned to the second card before
loading the driver.  Or you could do it from the boot loader or
something (The system I work with has a stupid bios that doesn't have a
clue about bridges, so we added IRQ fixup code to grub to deal with all
PCI bridges before booting the system).

Linux doesn't think anything.  It goes by the IRQ assigned to the
device, which is in one of the PCI registers on each device.  You can
change those registers though, and then it should use the new value
(although you may have to change it from the kernel before it enumerates
the pci devices).

I would NEVER do that.  That actually disables the BIOS from doing
configuration of most hardware since it really means "Microsoft wants to
do configuration themselves and asked us to put in a setting to make the
bios only configure drive controllers and sound cards".  I know some
people have worked towards making linux a "PnP OS" by microsoft
standards, but whether it is entirely there or not by now I am not sure.
Fortunately most motherboards I have ever bought come preset at 'pnp os
installed' off, which is how I like it.  I have had a number of
problems on systems with that setting on, which went away when the
setting was set back to off.
It might actually work better if you change that, although it may also
just make no difference.
