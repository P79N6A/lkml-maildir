Subject: [patch 00/11] mutex subsystem, -V8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

this is version -V8 of the generic mutex subsystem. It consists of the 
following 11 patches:
  add-atomic-xchg.patch
  mutex-generic-asm-implementations.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-i386.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-x86_64.patch
  mutex-asm-mutex.h-arm.patch
  mutex-arch-mutex-h.patch
  mutex-core.patch
  mutex-docs.patch
  mutex-debug.patch
  mutex-debug-more.patch
  xfs-mutex-namespace-collision-fix.patch
the patches are against Linus' latest GIT tree, and they should work 
fine on every Linux architecture.
i have tested all 5 mutex implementation variants under MUTEX_DEBUG_FULL 
on x86: native, -dec, -xchg, -null and debug.
Changes since -V7:
 11 files changed, 258 insertions(+), 122 deletions(-)
- added a __mutex_fastpath_trylock(count, fn) method for architectures 
  to define a trylock fastpath.
  While trylock has no 'slowpath' in the classic sense, but e.g. the 
  ARMv6 fastpath implementation can 'fail' to take the lock 
  speculatively, and has to call back into the generic code in that 
  case, to guarantee that the trylock is actually attempted. The debug 
  and xchg variant also makes use of the generic code, unconditionally.  
  The ARMv6 fastpath implementation is from Nicolas Pitre.
  this change gets rid of the final #ifdefs from the core kernel/mutex.c
  code, and makes it squeeky clean ;-)
- inline mutex_is_locked() (Nicolas Pitre)
- more cleanups (of assembly code in particular).
