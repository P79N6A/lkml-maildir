I don't know why Intel do not want to release informations on their
speedstep technology.  I think that this is more likely a 'marketing'
issue, or something like that.  I don't think that their techs
want to withhold the specs for a proper support on SpeedStep
under linux, or other free OS, also, and hope that one day
Intel will release proper docs.  Well, we can dream...
