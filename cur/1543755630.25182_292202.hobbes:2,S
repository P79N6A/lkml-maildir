It is.  And as such, it is not allowed.

No, the stated purpose of that marking is to prevent non-GPLd code from
using those symbols.  I don't see how you can state that using sysfs
files in your driver does not make it a "derived work" and force you to
make all of your driver GPL.
I suggest that you consult your company's lawyers for what to do here.
