Hi there,
Just a quick and easy question for you.
I am aware of three ways to make my laptop suspend/hibernate:
1. suspend
2. ususpend
3. suspend2
The first two are directly part of the official linux
distribution and the third one is easy to install into it.
Here is my question: what is the recommended method ? How does
suspend compare to ususpend/suspend2 ? Is there any chance to see
suspend2 be part of the official linux distribution in a near
future or not ?
Regards,
Xavier
