An updated version of the iproute2 utilities is available at:
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/iproute2/download/iproute2-2.6.11-050330.tar.gz
It supports the latest features from 2.6, but is backwards compatiable
with 2.4.
This update includes several bugfixes and build clean from
the previous version (2.6.11-050314):
[Jamal Hadi Salim]
	* Proper verison of iptables headers (from 1.3.1)
	* Set revision file in m_ipt
	* Fix action_util naming in mirred
	* don't call ll_init_map in mirred
[Thomas Graf]
	* Warn about wildcard deletions and provide IFA_ADDRESS upon
	  deletions to enforce prefix length validation for IPv4.
	* Fix netlink message alignment when the last routing attribute added
	  has a data length not aligned to RTA_ALIGNTO.
[Masahide NAKAMURA]
	* ipv6 xfrm allocspi and monitor support.
[Stephen Hemminger]
	* include/linux/netfilter_ipv4/ip_tables.h dont include compiler.h
	  because it isn't needed and not on all systems
	* Update rtnetlink.h and pkt_cls.h to be stripped versions
	  of headers from 2.6.12-rc1
	* switch to stack for netem tables
	* add -force option to batch mode
	* handle midline comments in batch mode
	* sum per cpu fields in lnstat correctly
