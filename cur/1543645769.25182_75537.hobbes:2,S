By the way, the place you will probably see variance in LMbench is in the
context switch benchmarks, it's almost certainly due to randomness in 
cache layout and there isn't a thing we can do about it.  You can run a
zillion runs to get an average but please realize that is an *average*.
The context switch number are accurate, the low ones represent no cache
collisions and the high ones represent lots of cache collisions.
FYI.  I don't like it either.
