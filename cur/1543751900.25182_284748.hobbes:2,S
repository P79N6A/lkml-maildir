If you mean that Linux will require that the boot processor (BSP) will 
always have physical APIC ID == 0, then it is already too late for 
i386.  I've posted a message to the root of this thread on some example 
boxes with weird APIC numbering schemes that are in our lab.
I don't trust every single BIOS writer to _always_ make the BSP physical 
APIC ID 0 for x86-64 either.  Why do you wish to require this anyway?
It is far safer to make no assumptions about APIC numbering and just 
accept whatever the BIOS gives us in the MPS and/or ACPI tables.  A few 
simple arrays indexed by CPU number will reveal the physical and 
logical APIC IDs whenever we need them.
So, why should Linux care about any CPU's physical APIC ID?
