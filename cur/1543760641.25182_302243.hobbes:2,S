This is done through the syslog, right?  Is that acceptable?
It looks like you are logging a lot of stuff, all without a kernel log
level, which is going to really mess up syslog parsers.
Have you thought about just providing userspace with access to the error
message, in binary form, from a sysfs file, and causing a kevent to wake
userspace up to know to read from the file?  That way all of the parsing
of the error log can be done in userspace, and there is no formatting of
the messages from within the kernel.
thanks,
