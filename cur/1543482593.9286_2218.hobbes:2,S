This option is already compiled in, so I'm afraid that's not it.
However,
I have noticed a couple more oddities.  For instance, if the kernel is
compiled with the autoconfigure bootp option(the one for diskless
workstations), upon bootup the kernel will run bootp twice, once very
early on(the one I just mentioned above) and later after mounting all
the filesystems.  The first time around it succeeds, but the second
time it fails.  Also, if I run bootpc from the command line after
bootup,
nothing happens--it just says, "Network unreachable" and hangs.
However, if I give the system a static IP bootpc will run and display
all the correct information.
An additional note:  No one that I've talked to here has been able
to get bootp to work with the 2.1 or 2.2 series of kernels, regardless
of what ethernet card is in their box.  This would include 3-4 people
other than myself.
