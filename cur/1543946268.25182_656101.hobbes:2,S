That doesn't cause me to magically sign off this sort of patches, too.
The sanity check is clearly broken in file2alias.c, as it checks something
from the target kernel against the host environment it is compiled on.
That doesn't make any sense at all.
I also don't see why we want to compare the size of the struct in kernel
and userland. It is not used in userland.
So NACK for this SSB patch.
