nmi_watchdog=2 will never do anything on a K6 since the K6s lack the
on-CPU local APIC and performance counter features needed for this mode.
nmi_watchdog=1 needs an I/O APIC and (for K6) an external local APIC.
That configuration is very unusual (it was used for pre-Pentium
multiprocessor systems).
Your machine is behaving as expected. If you need NMI watchdog support
you'll have to find or add some other programmable NMI source.
