That's likely an issue for the Mandrake crew rather than me...
- obviously this means pgcc is a Mandrake supplement - oh well,
I'll see about grabbing a regular gcc.
However, I do note that I had no trouble at all using pgcc to build 2.3.18 
Hmm. I did just notice the warning to stay away from pgcc etc in the
Changes file... perhaps this kind of thing should be in the top level
README or in a separate 'COMPILER.WARNING' file at the top level for the
devel kernels.
Thanks
