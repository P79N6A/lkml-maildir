Even if it checked the address it would not be unique because you can have multiple
interfaces with the same addresses but different netmasks.
The SIOCGIFNETMASK interface is just broken. If you really wanted it you should use
rtnetlink instead, which allows multiple answers to a single question.
Likely postfix doesn't really need it though, the concept of checking for "local"
address is pretty dubious and likely to be incorrect for many cases.
