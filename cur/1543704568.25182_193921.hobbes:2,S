This "laptop-mode" patch would make things far worse than they're now: Spinning
up the disk about every 10min would reduce their lifetime significantly instead
of extending it.
It's not a laptop, but a server with an ordinary 3.5" harddisk I'm speaking about,
my goal is not saving power, but spinning down a harddisk that does not need to
spin up the whole day long.
What I'm questioning is whether there's a need to write to idle disks at all -
does anybody know why kjournald writes data even if there is nothing to commit at all?
