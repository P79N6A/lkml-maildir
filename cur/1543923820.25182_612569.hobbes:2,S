I had a look on how other subsystems handle this case and yes, they
duplicate the id number from its parent device. So I applied the
attached patch to my tree.
The best would be to use '"%d-%d", hdev->id, conn->handle', but at the
time we create the hci_conn structure and add the sysfs entry the
connection handle is not know yet. I have to look into that and see if
that can be changed.

Marcel
