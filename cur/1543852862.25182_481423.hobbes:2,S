Note that i386 still defaults to logical flat mode, so whatever hotplug 
CPU races there are, they need to be fixed! Given how rare CPU hotplug 
systems are i have no problem with having these races in the kernel for 
a while until it's fixed.
Also, distro kernels enable CPU_HOTPLUG frequently. It is just ugly 
beyond recognition to switch the programming of the IRQ hardware on 
non-hotplug hardware just because a mostly-software feature (hotplug) is 
enabled ...
if hotplug breaks suspend then fix it, dont hack it around (on one 
platform) by slowing down the system [and causing other problems] ...
