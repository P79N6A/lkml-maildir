Hi !
Is it possible by any means to isolate any given process, so that
it'll be unable to crash system. Suppose all the process needs is
stdin, stdout, and CPU time. Can Linux guarantee that given process
won't hurt system stability ? Let us soppose that we have ideal CPU
without mistakes. How can I limit CPU time/Mem Usage for given
process?
Please, supply ANY suggestions.
My ideas:
create some user, and decrease his ulimits up to miminum of 1 process,
0 core size, appropriate memory/ etc.
Thanks!
