Note that just because /proc/cpuinfo shows 'ht' does not mean you can
use it in hyperthreaded mode. To do that, you also have to have >1
sibling in the physical package. Non-Xeon type P4's don't have the
extra sibling, so don't function as a hyperthreaded CPU.

It's more a case of whats missing in your CPU package 8-)
