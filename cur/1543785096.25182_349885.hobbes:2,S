Igor,
I just had a chance to do some more testing, and the crash even occurs
in 2.6.13-rc2.  I haven't had a chance to get serial console logs yet,
but I assume they will turn out similarly to the ones captured on
2.6.13 (glancing at the text as it scrolled by).  So, something must
have changed between 2.6.12-rc6+patches and 2.6.13-rc2 (including the
patches).
Is there anything specific you want me to look for?
Andreas
