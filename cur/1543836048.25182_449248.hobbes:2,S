Maybe, though I'd rather not do that conversion with the hardware to test it.
sidenote: prepare_to_wait() and friends could really use some kerneldoc explaining
their purpose rather than their internal workings.

A split-up patchset would for sure make sense for committing upstream.
Though, at least each file touched here is a separate cset.
