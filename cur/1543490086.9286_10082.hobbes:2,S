I have 2 SCSI HD, one Linux with  2.2.2 kernel and another DOS. I don't
have any problem with mounting msdos fs. I didn't have any problem with
2.2.1 kernel either. Msdos mounted in sturtup.
My /etc/fstab:
# device			directory	type	options	freq pass
# -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
/dev/sdb1			/		ext2	defaults  0     1
/dev/sdb2			none		swap	defaults  0	2
/dev/sdb3			/home/users	ext2	defaults  0	2	
none				/proc		proc	defaults  0	2
/dev/sda1			/dos/drive_C	msdos	defaults  0	2
/dev/sda5			/dos/drive_D	msdos	defaults  0	2
/dev/sda6			/dos/drive_E	msdos	defaults  0	2
Take a look at your /usr/src/linux/.config file. You probably didn't
enable msdos fs support:
            CONFIG_MSDOS_FS=y
Sincerely,
          K.V.P
