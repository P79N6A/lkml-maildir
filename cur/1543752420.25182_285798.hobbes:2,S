Sshfs (idea shamelessly stolen from the LUFS project).  If you can ssh
to some host you can also mount it as a normal user like this:
   mkdir /tmp/kempelen
   sshfs mszeredi@kempelen: /tmp/kempelen
It pretty much trumps all other network filesystems wrt ease of server
setup, it's secure, efficient, all you need in a network filesystem :)
(available from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse;
 needs
fuse-2.2-pre3 and libglib-2.0)
