Of course that's not ok.
Come on people, does everyone think I just put that warning message in
the kernel for fun to force you to create an empty release function?
Why do people ignore the helpful hints that the kernel provides?
I can take that check out and watch people get their code wrong even
more, as it sure doesn't seem like it is helping anyone out these
days...
Corey, haven't we discussed this in the past?
