I recently switched from bk to darcs (actually looked into it after the author 
mentioned on LKML that he had imported the kernel tree). Very impressed so 
far, but as you say,

I expect something as large as the kernel tree would cause problems in this 
respect.

:) I try to built everthing from the original source, but in this case I 
couldn't. The GHC needs the GHC + some GHC addons in order  to compile 
itself...

From a functionality standpoint, darcs seem very similar to monotone, with a 
couple minor trade-offs in either direction.
I wonder if Linus would mind publishing his feature requests to the monotone 
developers, so that other projects, like darcs, would know what needs working 
on.
