Ah OK. in this case already looking at interupt coalescing at firmware
level which mitigates this 'earlier on', however even this
stratgy fails at higher pps levels => i.e. in these circumstances
the card buffer is already full-ish, as the interrupt has already been
postponed, and postponing it further can only cause dropped packets
through buffer overrun.
