The original question is enough of an FAQ that I thought it would be good to
have real numbers rather than just my assurances that Linux has a fast FS
layer.  Therefore I wrote a benchmarking program that creates/writes/destroys
files and ran it under several operating systems and on several types of
file systems.  I have included that program as an attachment to this mail.
Here are the results:

Hardware:
1 -> 333 MHz PII, 512M ram, Compaq WDE4360W disk
2 -> Ultra450 class Sun server (300MHz?)
3 -> Personal Workstation 600 AU. 600 MHz alpha.  1.5G ram
4 -> 75 MHz Pentium, 32M ram, Segate ST31200N disk
Notice how Linux writting to an ext2 file system is significantly faster
than any other OS/FS combination.  The next closest is Solaris writting
to tmpfs, and its still far behind ext2.  Its also good to notice how
slow both Solaris and Digital Unix are on their local file systems.  This
is probably why both have a ram base file system.
Please note that this benchmark is intended to measure the time it takes to
create and delete files, which is expensive on most non-linux systems.  It
does not indicate anything about the data I/O rate to an existing file.
If someone would like to put this table in an FAQ, please be my guest.  Also
if you have any criticisms, I would like those too.  Also, I would like to
know how NT does on this test if anyone has an NT system they can test it
on.
Thanks,
Jim
