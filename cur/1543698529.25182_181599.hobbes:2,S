Is it true that JFS still doesn't use a /lost+found?
The justification being that it doesn't want to stuff up the directory
structure anymore than it already supposedly is.
Personally, I think this behaviour is shit, because I would have to
reinstall from backup everytime I get an unclean shutdown (which
defeats the purpose of having journalling at all). (from memory, at
fsck time, it doesn't actually print out that many diagnostics, so I
don't know what adverse things have happened to my filesystem).
I have had plenty of problems with it. One I can think of is under
debian, after your $RANDOM mounts, it doesn't manage to do the
automatic forced fsck, so none of the filesystems get mounted. It
tries to stumble along without having mounted /usr. I have to reboot,
log in single user, and manually fsck. I don't know whther this is a
fsck.jfs or a debian deficiency.
