That's what makes it confusing. It's not really updates _for_
the kernel 2.2.x Instead, it's updates _with_ the kernel. The
kernel doesn't care squat about what `init` and its `kids`
do.
Init could very well be an application program and, in
some servers and embeded machines, it is. It just doesn't
want to call exit(), whatever goes wrong, and it should have
a generic SIGCHLD handler so zombies don't accumulate.
