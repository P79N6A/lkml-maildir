I think it's pretty safe to say that these weird ready values are from 
TF emulation on controller side.  The ready/not ready distinction is 
probably too simplistic but those values aren't supposed to appear 
during post-reset readiness test.
Sorry about the big regression.  Heh... It's amazing how all the 
controllers I tested didn't show the problem and I did test a good 
number of combinations.
I still think it would be better to have a unified readiness test 
function.  The problem is subtle (device misdetection on hotplug of 
certain drives) and went unnoticed quite some time for JMB ahcis && test 
coverage over those things can't be good.  I'll try to think about 
something better.
Thanks.
