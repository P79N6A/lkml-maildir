Yes, they are. But your __local_*() variants are not. They require a
full preempt_disable because they do not execute atomically.
So having local_begin/end() -> migrate_disable/enable() is ok.
And __local_begin/end() -> preempt_disable/enable() is ok.
I just want to make the naming and usage consistent with the protection
offered.
