POSIX has this terribly useful thing to say:
# If the exit of the process causes a process group to become orphaned, and if
# any member of the newly-orphaned process group is stopped, then a SIGHUP
# signal followed by a SIGCONT signal shall be sent to each process in the
# newly-orphaned process group.
The Rationale is at least a little chattier.  See
  
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/exit.html#tag_03_131
if you want to read it.
Basically, this is so that a stopped process group won't unintentionally
stay stopped when its shell no longer has a connection to it.  For whatever
that's worth.
I think this patch is well within the spirit of that definition.  If a
process is stopped, but there is a debugger attached to it and the stopping
signal is not one that would normally stop the process, then don't count it
as a stopped job.  Without this, when you continue past a fork() call and
the parent quickly exits, the child will get an unaccountable SIGHUP.
It's not perfect, of course - the application might be SIG_IGN'ing SIGTSTP,
but stopped in the debugger for it anyway.  It's not worth being that
complicated here, though.
Linus, please apply.
