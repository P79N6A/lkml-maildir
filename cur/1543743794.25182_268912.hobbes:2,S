Might I again refer you to google?
Searching for 'linux framebuffer 1024x768 vga=' gives me 11.800 hits,
which surely is enough to choose from. Also, this is mentioned in
/usr/src/linux-<whatever version>/Documentation/fb/<somefile, depending
on your framebuffer, which you didn't mention>. Those docs were lovingly
crafted by kernel hackers hoping to answer all the questions users may
have, so it would be a shame not to use them, right?
Good luck,
Jurriaan
