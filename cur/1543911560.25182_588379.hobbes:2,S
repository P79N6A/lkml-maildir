If you have a spare audio-card lying around or maybe a tv-card/webcam or
so, give then:
http://www.vanheusden.com/aed/
 (for audio)
http://www.vanheusden.com/ved/
 (for video4linux)
a try.
And no, audio-entropyd won't fill up the entropy pool in a second, it
takes a while. And often video-entropyd bails out because of not enough
noise in the video-signal.
