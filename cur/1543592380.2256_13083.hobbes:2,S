Sorry this is a slippery slope argument and it won't wash.
The kernel is intended as the arbiter between userspace and hardware,
and userspace and userspace.  Format conversion has nothing to do with
arbitration.
Format conversion in kernelspace is far less flexible than userspace: 
you cannot replace your algorithms at will nor fix bugs at will.  You
cannot support assembly optimizations for format conversions without
bloating the kernel.
Finally, the example you describe is invalid.  If your tool is doing
-two- format conversions, then [again] the tool should be fixed.  The
kernel most definitely should not work around stupid shortcomings of
userspace software.

Send a patch for this instead!
Format conversion should not be in the kernel...
