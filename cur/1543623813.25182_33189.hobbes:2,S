Ahh.. indeed, changing the burst size to 64 bytes (from the default 128)  
makes a big difference on my ultra5, thanks for the hint. Does it make any
sense to differentiate between platforms, or is 64 a good all-around
value?

MRM (and MRL) seem to be enabled by default, although the chip docs are a 
bit unclear about it.
Thanks,
Ion
