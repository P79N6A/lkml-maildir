I know what you mean.  But please see
  
http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~danlee/fun/psaux/
for my  arguments against the  direction currently taken by  the input
developers.
Moreover, while  most people report problems of  various severity with
the mouse  after upgrading  to 2.6, the  direct psaux port  does solve
most of those problems,  providing a smooth migration path.  Actually,
I would still be staying with 2.4.* if I didn't write my psaux module,
because the touchscreen function on my notebook is important to me.  I
have written my XFree86 driver for it, and I'm not going to port it to
kernel space.
While most  Linux people frown upon  Microsoft for putting  the GUI in
the  NT kernel,  I  frown upon  the  input developers  for moving  the
functions of 'gpm' into kernel space.  I can't see any good reasons to
deprecate 'gpm' that way.
    Andrew> Have you sent a report regarding the touchscreen problem?
No.   That's not  a  problem  specific with  my  touchscreen.  It's  a
general  problem  with   the  design  of  the  input   layer.   It  is
implementing  *policies*  (on how  to  interpret  data  read from  the
PS2/AUX port), instead of providing  a *mechanism* to access (read and
write) that port.
    Andrew> Is it a straightforward bug, or has real functionality
    Andrew> been lost?
Yes.  Directly talking  to a device on the PS2/AUX  port (like what we
can do to a  RS232 port) is no longer possible in  2.6, until my psaux
module.  This is certainly a lost functionality.
See my page with URL given above for a more detailed discussion.
