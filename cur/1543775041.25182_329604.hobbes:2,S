Well, I'm not surprised. :-(
Probably there is a conflict between e820 map and root bus ranges
reported by ACPI. I think that it would be better to just drop
gregkh-pci-pci-collect-host-bridge-resources-02.patch rather than
try to fix it, at least until such conflicts can be resolved in
a sane way.
