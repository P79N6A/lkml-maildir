Whoever told you that the driver is broken is mistaken.  The driver
works well.  The *chip*, on the other hand, isn't the best of show.
The trouble with the SMC chip is that it has only 4 packet buffers.
When it is used in a design with either a relatively slow CPU or in a
design with other IO performance bottlenecks, it will tend to drop
packets as it is very easy for the buffers to fill with incoming data
before the CPU can unload them.  Nico reported excellent throughput on
one board.
