Subject: Still some problems with UHCI driver in 2.4.5 on VIA chipsets

Another thing I was happy to find working better in 2.4.5, was USB.  I had
just dumped off ~70 high res pics (which would've taken forever via the
usual RS232 method), and was deleting the last pics when gphoto froze.  The
dmesg log has the same messages it had before when I experimented with 2.4.1
and 2.2.19.  I'm not sure if it was harder to trigger the problem now
because of improvements to 2.4.5, or if it was because the proc is 1.1Ghz
(affecting a possible race condition).
The USB controller:
  Bus  0, device   4, function  2:
    USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. UHCI USB (rev 22).
      IRQ 5.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  
      I/O at 0xd400 [0xd41f].
  Bus  0, device   4, function  3:
    USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. UHCI USB (#2) (rev 22).
      IRQ 5.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  
      I/O at 0xd000 [0xd01f].
