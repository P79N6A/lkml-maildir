Ah, sorry about that.  I missed that in your patch.  The previous
version of the ioctl just returned copied the values from the id
structure.  Doing the id on the fly is much more accurate and will catch
any other fields that happen to change over time.

That sounds good.  That would make it easier to see what values from the
id are actually used.
Thanks.
