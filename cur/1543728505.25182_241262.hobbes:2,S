And if we decide not to do this, the size difference shrinks even
more considerably. People who don't give a rats ass about this stuff
aren't wasting memory for each sysfs node.
The only justification I've seen so far for this bloat is
"other subsystems have put their crap in sysfs, so I want to do the same".

Yes. And then when presented with the "but this is useless, because we already
have /dev/cpu" argument, you decided to deprecate that for no reason too,
in the name of 'consistency'.
This is madness.
This 'consistency' costs. As I already mentioned, an application that
runs on any kernel would now have to support an extra method of obtaining
the data it needs.  Then people wonder why userspace apps are bloating
up further and further each year. Then people wonder why installers
suddenly need an extra xMB of RAM to install the latest version of
a distro.

There was a 'joke' a while ago about some corporations handing out
bonuses to its engineers each time a patch was accepted that removed
a user of the big kernel lock.  These days I wonder if the same
analogy is holding true for systfs patches.
