Would that really work for them?  Looks to me like it would result
in self-deadlock if they passed in session->lock.
Or did you have something else in mind for them?
These are the __kfifo_get() and __kfifo_put() uses in:
	drivers/scsi/iscsi_tcp.c
	drivers/scsi/libiscsi.c
	drivers/infiniband/ulp/iser/iser_initiator.c
