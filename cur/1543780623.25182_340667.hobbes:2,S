I am using IORESOURCE_MEM to pass in the base addresses of the necessary
clock registers. I also need to pass a fractional divider clk id. The
resource table seemed appropriate because the base addresses and the
divider id are closely related. Its also a great framework for enabling
varying resource lists. Currently I don't use this, but in the future I
may. Its possible in a future board revision there may not be a
fractional divider available. The resource framework makes querying for
the clk id very straight forward as opposed to magic values in a struct
I pass through platform_data. 
It can easily be moved to platform_data (or split between the two) if
that is more appropriate. Thanks for the feedback. _matt
