What system calls would you want in a relaxed SECCOMP?

Would be interesting to try that out -- just adding two memcpyies to 
the existing code and see how much slower it gets. My guess
would be not very, even e.g. on a Atom system (which are really
not all that slow).
Presumably you could always #ifdef it if it's really a problem
on some specific system. That would be needed anyways for 
non linux systems.
