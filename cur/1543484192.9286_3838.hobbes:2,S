Kernel documentation is something we're sadly lacking and it's responsible
for maybe 40% of the postings to linux-kernel.  Therefore improving
documentation (quality as well as quantity :-) is a good way of improving
the signal to noise ratio on linux-kernel.  Documenting the system is
also a good way of learning about it of course - and may well produce
more useful documentation since you document what you needed to research.

This sounds like a fine idea.  It's a list which is clearly distinct from
linux-kernel, people won't post to the wrong list through ignorance and
I don't think kernel-doc would suffer from having a different readership
to linux-kernel.

I'd prefer it to be on vger so that people who ask vger for what lists
it runs find out about it.  On the other hand, perhaps people don't
find out about lists that way any more *sigh*.  Yeah, just set it up
and advertise it on linuxhq & so on.
