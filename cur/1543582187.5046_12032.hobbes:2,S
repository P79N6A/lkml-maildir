  I've never been able reliably reproduce any sort of mke2fs hang on
systems with more than 512M of RAM.  It would be interesting to know if
other people are seeing this under SW-RAID, and other controllers. 
(Currently everyone in direct contact with me uses a Mylex controller.) 
The key seems to be 512 or smaller amounts of RAM, and a 80G or larger
logical drive.
