Right, however, this was assuming you'd want to allow the user to use
mlock at all -> limit set at > 0: One page. That's hardly useful. If
you have a 64M machine you really do want to set the limits such that
a user can mlock one or two megabytes of memory (to run that mpeg
video decoder smoothly) but not allow them to do that in 1000
processes at the same time.
