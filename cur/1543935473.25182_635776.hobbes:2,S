Looking good. I wonder if we could also have some way to cross-ref these 
things with the regression list (notably try to get pointers to them in 
the regression list). 
Right now, the regression list keeps track of the things that are closed, 
but kerneloops.org obviously doesn't see that, so it's not obvious which 
oopses are "uninteresting" since they've been fixed.
