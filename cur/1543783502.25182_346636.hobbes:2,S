Our mpi link checker tool does a 1 way transfer of a 0 byte message (+ header) 
and times it to each system (in addition to other tests).  All systems in a 
cluster are showing the same high latency.  The numbers I gave were supposed 
to be us, I used the wrong unit by accident.
Low latency is often essential to clustered applications.  While a delay of up 
to 1024 us doesn't affect regular communications too much, it may severely 
affect mpi jobs.
Thanks.
