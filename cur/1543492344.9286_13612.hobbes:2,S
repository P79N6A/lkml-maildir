I've heard that the timing was very important to these kinds of modem
trying to support these brain-dead things would mess up scheduling as it
needs constant real-time dsp in order to work.
IMHO well-behaved hardware should use buffering, dma, etc to be time
constraint friendly to the OS. Real modems are serial ports buffered with
16550A's or better. Or maybe USB modems as I've been rumored as to their
existence.

Play dsp cause the manufactorer was to cheap to be good?
Chew up 20% or more of your cpu? Constantly allow it to preempt the things
running on your system?
Sounds real ugly to me.
Of course I'll be quiet now as I'm a little extreme in the fact that I
would pay extra for a modem without the evil fax capabilities.
I really hate fax;->
