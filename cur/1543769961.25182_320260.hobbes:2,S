Yes.  Hardware wants it this way.  For 8bit wide font you must write font data 
in low 8 bits (some hardware on the way does swapping on BE archs), and for 
16bit wide font you must write font data in low 16 bits.  In both cases first 
pixel is in bit7 of byte 0, going through to bit0 of byte 0, followed by bit7 of 
byte 1 through bit0 of byte 1.  And so on for widths > 16.  Inner leX_to_cpu 
works on data of font size, while outer cpu_to_le32 works on accelerator data 
size, which is always 32 bit.
If you want it absolutely correct (as font data are in big endian), you should 
write cpu_to_le32(swab<font_width>(be<font_width>_to_cpup(chardata))).  Inner 
be16_to_cpup retrieves font data into bits 15 -> 0, swab reorders bytes so first 
pixel is in bit 7, not bit 15 (or 31 for 32bit wide font), and outer cpu_to_le32 
nullifies effect of external swab32() engine.

I'm not sure about speed effects.  Is gcc smart enough to notice that two 
different width byteswaps can be combined to simple shift?
