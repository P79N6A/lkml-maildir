Hi,
I have the log message ``__nfs_fhget: inode still busy, i_count=2''
with some NFS servers (SunOS, Dec OSF/1, and others).  I have create a
test-case that trigger this log.
Both vanilla 2.2.10 and Alan 2.2.10-ac10, produce this message, with knfsd
and user-land nfsd.
This bug is trigger by the following conditions:
. a process A is in a NFS directory, said `nfs-tmp'.
. In the same time, another process B renames it to `nfs-current'
. then process A try to access his current directory `nfs-tmp', it receives
an I/O error and the kernel output the sanity-check message.
The following shell script trigger this bug, it win all the time :)
Hope this help.
PS: I'm not in these mailing lists, don't forget to CC me.
