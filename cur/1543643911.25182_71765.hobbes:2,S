That's OK - you're already doing -rmap.  I just can't read.

Strange.  2.5 should have done badly.  There are many variables...
We're on top of the VM latency problems now.  Jens is moving ahead

tunability of the read-versus-write policy.  Once we sort out the
accidental writes-starve-read problem we'll do well at this.
