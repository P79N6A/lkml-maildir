Ok, a later patch already makes 'set' required, and I was only using the
failure path in Coda. I'll change this so that set never fails.

Actually we really don't want this guy hashed, I'll use new_inode(sb)
for this one.

Ok, will do that.
Should I create one patch that goes in relative to iget_locked-6, or
resubmit updated patches for each step? I guess an additional patch is
