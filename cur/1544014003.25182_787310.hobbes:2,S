Some days are not 86400 seconds long.  That's a fact and regardless of
how inconvenient it is, we have to live with it.  Some years don't have
365 days; some months don't have 30 days; some Februaries don' have 28
days; and now, some days don't have 86400 seconds. What's the point in
fighting this?
If you want to know the days between two times, dividing by 86400
doesn't cut it.

I haven't been able to find this Annex B that Alan talked of, so I can
only go by the man page, which states, simply and explicitly, that
time() returns seconds since Epoch, and also that Epoch is start of
January 1 1970.  To my mind, time *does* recognise leap seconds.
