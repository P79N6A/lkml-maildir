SS is really painful on a high latency connection, CVS is a wonder of
efficiency in comparison. At least that is my experience. But that is
probably not your setup.
(and yes, I understood that you compared with windows performance)
You may want to know that smbfs does not do any file locking. I don't know
if SS depends on that or not. I do know that some people have tried
running dos based database programs in dosemu accessing a database over
smbfs with database corruption as a result.

Very nice. The commandline SS client would never work for me under wine.
I'll have to try that again.
