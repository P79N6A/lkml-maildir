Added cycling logic to dialog_checklist identical to what
dialog_menu already has.

Hi,
Can you give an example of a checklist (aka radiolist in menuconfig)
where this change has an effect?
I expected Timer frequency (choosing between 100, 250, 1000 HZ) to
cycle, but it does not.  And I expected Default I/O scheduler
to cycle, but it does not.  So where can I look for a change
after applying this patch?
Thanks,
