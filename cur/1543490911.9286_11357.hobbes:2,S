I am not 100% sure, but I think this CHS comes from bios and
bioses tend to refuse properly autodetect the drive that's
larger 8.4GB. I usually have to set up the proper geometry in bios cmos setup.
If you only use linux on that drive it doesn't really matter,
but if you use any M$ -- most of them have trouble with more
than 1024 cylinders.
Make sure that no partition that accessible to them runs over 1024 cyls.
I had seen them trash other partitions when trying to do that.
