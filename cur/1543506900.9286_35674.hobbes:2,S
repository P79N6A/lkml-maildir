Some moths ago I've posted a patch for some bug in the bttv package, yet
(2.2.10) it hasn't got into the kernel - why?:
1st) the msp3400 driver registered its functions with &funcname instead of
     funcname which lead into NULL pointers and so silent TV cards with
     egcs
2nd) I would propose to make the NODGA macro in bttv.c a config option -
     this is a very useful workaround for all owners of buggy graphic
     boards - like my Matrox G200
     It would be nice If I had an option "Activate workarounds" below
     "bttv chipset" in make *config - yet I don't know how to do that, so
     I can't send a patch for that
        happy hacking,
        Konrad Rosenbaum
