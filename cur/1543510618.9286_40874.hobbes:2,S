Hi,
    I compiled a new kernel for my 400 Mhz celeron with 6 GB IDE hard
disk and 64Mb ram.
The compiled kernel is not able to detect any partitions. It gets struck
their. I enabled support
for IDE disk and multiple device drivers. The kernel version is
2.2.5-15. Any suggestions
for compiling.
Thanks
