SUBTERFUGUE 0.1.1 is available.  The main change is a partial integration of
Pavel Machek's experimental safe scratch area code, which can prevent threaded
programs from escaping SUBTERFUGUE.
From NEWS:
Version 0.1.1 ("sanchez")
* First cut at integration of Pavel Machek's patch.  It includes his safe
  scratch area stuff (see scratch.py and ScratchTrick.py), plus several new
  tricks (Arg, Net, NoKill, NoClose123, GoodDisc).
* Enhancement to SimplePathSandbox to support denial of access to certain
  paths.  (also from Pavel)
==============================================================================
This is SUBTERFUGUE.  See 'NEWS' for info on the latest release.
SUBTERFUGUE is a framework for observing and playing with the reality of
software; it's a foundation for building tools to do tracing, sandboxing, and
many other things. You could think of it as "strace meets expect."
Here's a short (real) "screenshot" which hints at one of its possible uses:
    # sf --trick=SimplePathSandbox:"read=['/'];write=['/dev/tty'];net=1" bash
    # id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    # rm -f /etc/passwd
    write deny (unlink): '/etc/passwd'
    rm: cannot unlink `/etc/passwd': Permission denied
BEWARE: This is an alpha release.  It might not hose your system, but who can
say?  You probably shouldn't even be reading this.  Don't run this as root,
except on a scratch system.  Don't use it to run programs where a loss of
state might be disastrous (e.g., fetchmail).  Consider yourself warned.
