Arrgh! :-).
In that case I might take you up on the BK idea or write something using
bfd to munge the elf content - odd that it does not exist already.
The reason I want it is that I am creating a single elf output file which
is loaded in to SDRAM by a SystemACE chip and in order for that to work
correctly I need to give the appropriate tools a single elf input
containing everything where I want it to be loaded in memory.
Fun for the weekend I suppose... :-).
Jon.
