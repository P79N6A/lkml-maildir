Wael,
Could you please help us debug this issue? Unfortunately none of the
bugs reported about this issue
(
http://bughost.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1454
 and
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=432264
) have any debugging
output. Please reopen bug
http://bughost.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1454
 and add debugging
(loading module with debug=0x43fff) to your report to help us find out
what happens on your system when the driver loads as well as when you
change the rfkill settings.
Thank you very much
Reinette
