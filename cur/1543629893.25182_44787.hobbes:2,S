Martin,
You have a practical model that is coming togather nicely (compliments
from the old man), there is a change in the industry to use MMIO based ATA
HBA's.  We are currently in a transistion state of affairs, so the problem
Benjamin address that everyone has overlooked is going to bite hard and
soon.  There will even be HBA's whose channels will be split between IOMIO
and MMIO, thus being able to select between access calls is urgent.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
