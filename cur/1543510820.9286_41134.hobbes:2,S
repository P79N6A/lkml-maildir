Is it possible since I'm thrashing around on disk this is happening?
I would think this is unreasonable if it's the case. Please, anybody that
could help me grok the net_ratelimit stuff, help me get back into
coding/debugging. This IS very annoying.
BTW, AC, do your 2.3.18ac* patches address any of this? (Sorry if I'm being
lazy and not checking myself)
