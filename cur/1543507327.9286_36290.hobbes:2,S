Same kernel (2.2.12).
Same CD-ROM drive, same Rev of drive:
    TOSHIBA   Model: CD-ROM XM-6201TA  Rev: 1030
Different SCSI card:
    (scsi0) <Adaptec AHA-294X Ultra SCSI host adapter> found at PCI 15/0
Cannot reproduce problem here - CD-ROM door locks just fine when a CD-ROM
is mounted.
Just in case it helps anyone...
