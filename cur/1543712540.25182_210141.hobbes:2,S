Yup, it looks like that might be the problem here.  I've now gotten
control of the system again (since I also had a disk die, thankfully
the data is all mirrored!) at the same time, and when badblocks runs
away on your, it's a nasty thing.
So yes, I was running 2.6.5-rc2-mm1, and I've now just rebooted the
system into 2.6.5-rc2-mm4 (with -mm5 released as I type this... :-).
Things are looking better now, time to load test this system and see
how it handles again.
I'm still wondering why swapoff dies though.  Shouldn't it complete,
or at least have some way *to* complete if needed?  I realize, with a
memory leak in the filesystem, it's a hard thing to deal with.  
Anyway, thanks for the quick response, using -mm4 to compile -mm5 is
looking much better.  Much lower cache size, decent buffer, and still
some free memory.  Not to try a badblocks pass on my dead drive...
Here's some vmstat output (dual proc 550mhz Xeon, 768mb of RAM, -j3
compile)
