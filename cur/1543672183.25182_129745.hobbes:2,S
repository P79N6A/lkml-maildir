That only shows that you really don't want to use glibc's malloc and
sbrk implementations, but ones that are implemented as mmap in your
driver so you can keep track of it properly. LD_PRELOAD is your friend.

Who cares about your trace module?  That's the wrong approach to start
with.  And the removal of the sys_call_table export is not a political
issue but a technical one.   The interesting thing would be your memory
manager, but given the above hints you really should be able to fix it yourself
now..
