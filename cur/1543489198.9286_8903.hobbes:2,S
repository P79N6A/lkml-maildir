Does a method exist to mark the copied pages discardable so they don't end
up on swap? Obviously not a perfect solution, but not bad.

An alternate hack might be to push the on-the-fly-swap I suggested down
into the VM layer by having a flag somewhere in the mmap API. This is
cute, because then whether the swap were being done by a bit in the page
tables or by software, it could be portable to other Linux platforms.
Yes, I know it's sick. And I haven't even told you the really disgusting
part: the DSM folks will love it because it lets them share memory between
architectures! Don't choke, Larry!
