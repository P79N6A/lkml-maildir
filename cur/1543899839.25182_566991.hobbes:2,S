That's the biggest problem in the whole set. I do not allow for
any signal to the namespaces init (and use "standart" init in my
experiences), since I have no ideas of how to make it look good. 
Checking for abilities in the sys_kill() is a solution, but why 
wasn't it such in the global init case? Why init checks for signals
in get_signal_to_deliver(). I have to think a bit more with this 
place. Maybe checking for permissions in sys_kill is a good solution.
On of the ideas I had is that the namespace's init has to accept 
all the signals with si_code == SI_KERNEL (this will include signals 
from parent namespaces as well), but the problem is that struct 
siginfo's do not reach the get_signal_to_deliver in 100% times. If 
we just could somehow push the siginfo to init, I would concern the 
problem to be solved.
