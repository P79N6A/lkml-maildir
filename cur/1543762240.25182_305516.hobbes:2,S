SUS seems to be pretty clear on this.  The syscall descriptions for
write(2) and pwrite(2) explicitly describe O_SYNC as requiring
synchronized I/O file integrity completion.  ftruncate() has no such
requirement.
It would certainly be a reasonable thing to do, but I don't think it
strictly counts as a bug that we're not honouring O_SYNC here.
