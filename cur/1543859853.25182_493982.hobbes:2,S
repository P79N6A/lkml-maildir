Hi Russell,
well, the location itself was a subject to various discussions. At the 
end, drivers/hid won against drivers/input/hid, because, as Marcel 
correctly pointed out, in case of embedded systems there might be a need 
to have an abstraction for non-input devices and then we don't want to 
bundle it to tightly to input. There is no such implementation yet, but 
moving this code around is quite painful, so we don't want to do it more 
than once.

This help text has been there for ages, it was duplicated from previous 
help text from usb hid implementation, but you are right that the wording 
might confuse someone. Will change it eventually, thanks.
