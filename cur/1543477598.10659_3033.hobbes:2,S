Is is time for somebody come up with our own (sub-)partitioning scheme
then?  Something that is more robust and more flexible that DOS's aging
and broken scheme.  Flexible meaning that it has a much larger limit on
the number of partitions without having to resort to "extended"
partitions (16, 32?), and uses logical sector numbers instead of whole
cylinders (relying on disk geometry is getting to be a pain in the
*ss).  Such a scheme should be designed so that it could be used as a
subpartition from a DOS master partition table, but could also be the
master partition table.  This would be useful for systems that are
linux-only.  Redundancy of the partition table would also be a good
thing, like having an extra copy at the end of the disk.  A project for
2.3.x?
I noticed that there is a "linux extended partition" type (0x85), but it
seems to only do the same thing as DOS extended partitions, except that
it is probably ignored by DOS/WIN.
