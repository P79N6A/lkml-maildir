Thats an interesting question. For the modular case we manage owner counts
so I think it cannot fail for modules using it at that point. If you want to
rescind a line discipline at some other time however then that isnt true.

ldisc_get and ldisc_put are used for taking references to each ldisc class
ldisc_ref/deref to each instance of the ldisc class. The two are not the
same thing in the tty layer. The count on the class tells you when you can
unload the module, the count on the driver is users of that instance.
When I named them it seemed that the get/put methods belonged with the case
that behaves most like the other _get/_put cases
Thoughts - I've not found a simple answer for this one ?
