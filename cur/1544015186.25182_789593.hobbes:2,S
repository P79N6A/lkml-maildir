I didn't (although I thought of it). It seems to me like a blind attempt
and the problem is that I cannot afford to waste another "production
attempt" and that I cannot reproduce the crash whenever I want, so if I
upgrade I'll not be able to know whether the problem is fixed or not until
I got a new crash (or not). Moreover, if the root cause of the problem is
r8168 driver, it will crash in both cases (the driver doesn't change, it's
compiled from source by me).
Anyway, it's a good idea, I'll see if I have a new changes' window. Thank you.
