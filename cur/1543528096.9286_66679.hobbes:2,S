I believe its status is that they didn't get it to compile on linux before
putting it out there, they just stripped OS/2 out of it but didn't yet add Linux
to it.

Get Linux (
http://www.kernel.org
) plus ReiserFS
 (
http://devlinux.org/namesys
).  If you sell an OS or
internet appliance, buy a port of ReiserFS!  If you
need customizations and industrial grade support, we sell them.
