   AFAICS from the kernel ChangeLogs Linux versions 2.4.* and 2.5.* do not
   implement the interoperability features described above. Is that correct?
   Is someone working on a patch that implements these features?
We purposely do not implement the interoperability features because
they have known holes and also we totally disagree with them in
principle.
