I suspect ARM may have been the last one without one, no?
That said, cmpxchg won't necessarily be "high-performance" unless the hw 
supports it naturally in hardware, so..
Russell, are you ok with the code DavidH posted (the "try 2" one)? I'd 
like to get an ack from the ARM maintainer before applying it, but it 
looked ok.
