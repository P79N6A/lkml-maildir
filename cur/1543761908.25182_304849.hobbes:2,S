Number of unique physical id will tell you the number of physical CPU
packages in the system.
Number of unique core id will tell you the total number of CPU cores in
the system.
Number of processor will tell you the total number of logical CPUs on
the system.
Then to find out the matching pairs, 
- to pair up all HT siblings on a core: Processors that have same "core
id" are HT siblings in a core.
- to pair up all CPUs in a package: Processors that have same "physical
id" are all the CPUs belonging to the same physical package.
