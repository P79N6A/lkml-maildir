That really has to be locked down as well. For your purpose, I think the
use of elv_queue_empty() is much better even though it really is an
internal function. The problem mainly comes from AS, that can have non
empty queue but still return NULL in elv_next_request().
But yes, it needs to be locked. If you have pinned the other CPUs, then
I suppose it should work. But it's still a violation of the locking
rules, and one would get in trouble dropping the queue lock from the io
scheduler elevator_queue_empty_fn. No one does that currently, but... So
please take the lock.
