Hmm. Can't find the message in the kernel anymore.

Thanks. I found that address when searching linux-kernel but my connection 
was too slow to find out what's in there :) I know RedHat uses them also. 
It seems tcpdump is maintained upstream again according to www.tcpdump.org. 
I will check upstream and Alexey's patches.

Hmm, so this is the reason for being able to dump from isdn interfaces?
Is it still possible to analyze ethernet frames for example?

Sure. Thank you very much for this info. Hmm, this will require 2.2.x as
kernel, doesn't it? I would like to retain support for 2.0. I guess I 
have to delve into this :)
Thanks
