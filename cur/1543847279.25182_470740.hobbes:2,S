It would be even more simple and future proof if we could in
some way do it so "#include <foo/bar.h>" would pick up bar.h from
asm-$(ARCH) if it exists and otherwise pick up asm-generic/bar.h.
Then we could include the generic one in asm-generic and
all architectures would include it except those that provide their
own variant. The asm-$(ARCH) specific files would need a way to include
the asm-generic version.
I have no idea handy for how to actually implment this but wanted
just to share the idea.
The trade-off is that if it gets too iplicit then suddenly users will
loose overview of how it works.
