It detaches the work item, moves it to head-of-queue, reinserts it then
waits on it.  I think.
This might have a race+hole.  If a currently-running "unrelated"
work item tries to take the lock which the flush_work() caller is holding
then there's no way in which keventd will come back to execute
the work item which we just put on the head of queue.

flush_work() is supposed to work in the way which you describe.
But Oleg's "we may be running on a different CPU" comment has me all
confused.
