If they are suspended.
My plan is: let the drivers autosuspend on their own. If I see all of
them are autosuspended, then it looks like great time to put whole
system into s2ram...

That's ok.
... I also don't need to call any suspend() routines, because all the
drivers are already suspended, right?
And yes, I want device activity to prevent s2ram. If user is burning
CD, machine should not sleep. If user is actively typing, machine
should not sleep. My vision is: screen saver tells kernel keyboard
need not be very responsive, at that point keyboard driver can
autosuspend the keyboard, and if that was the last device, whole
system sleeps.
