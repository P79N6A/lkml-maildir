Yes. Sorry for not pointing out explicitly. Essentially 32bit kernel with
CONFIG_PREEMPT is calling math_state_restore() with interrupts disabled.
Handled this by enabling/disabling the interrupts around the blocking call.
with small code changes ensuring that it is safe to enable/disable interrupts
at this point.
Do you want a v4 or separate patch for handling the kmem_cache_alloc() failure
thanks,
