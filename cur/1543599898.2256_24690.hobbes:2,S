Just FYI, this is just around the corner.  Al Viro has made it mandatory
(I believe) to have a very simple initramfs, for doing things like mounting
the root filesystem and setting up other services which are now done in
the kernel at boot time.  This initramfs (very similar to initrd) is at
the end of the kernel image, so it can't get lost and doesn't require
sending a separate file (i.e. for network booting, etc).

Will never happen, as there would probably be overhead for both UP and SMP
to do this.  If you want something like this (for ease of admin or so),
you can generally run the SMP kernel on UP systems and take the performance
hit, but not everyone will do that.
Cheers, Andreas
