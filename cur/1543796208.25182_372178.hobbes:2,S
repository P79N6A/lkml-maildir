My _point_ is that some code doesn't care about accuracy.  If a  
networking timeout occurs a half-second later than it should, nothing  
bad happens.  We have configurable SCSI drive timeouts, precisely  
because it doesn't really matter all that much if we deliver it now  
or give the drive a couple seconds extra time to try to respond  
before signalling a reset.  And I agree with you that people should  
care, this distinction is important.

A ktimer should be used where the common case is the timer being  
added and expiring.  A ktimeout should be used where the common case  
is the timer being added and removed before it expires.  Simple enough?
