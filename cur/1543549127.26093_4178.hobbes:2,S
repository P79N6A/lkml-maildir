What I'm getting at is that the local system didn't make the change at all,
so there is _no way_ to make the write go through the local cache.
The write to disk happens on a remote system.  The only thing that happens
on the local system is that it gets a message that a buffer is invalid.
You don't want to have to re-send each buffer to each system that ever
read it.  It is much better to simply invalidate the cache, and only if
the client accesses it again will it be re-read.
It should be possible to mark a page non-uptodate, so that the next time
it is accessed locally it will re-read the _new_ data from disk.  Think
of the fs "revalidate" method.
Cheers, Andreas
