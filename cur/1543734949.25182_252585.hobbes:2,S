Indeed, removed.

Still, one should have a way to get at least a hint on whether the
FIFO has data or not (think poll() implementation).
What about adding a note in the header saying the function can be racy
and does not guarantee a subsequent kfifo_get will succeed ?

It's easy to adapt the generic interface to what you want, but difficult
to do the contrary. Let's be the most generic here (who knows, maybe 
somebody wants to add several structures at once...).

Sure, corrected.
