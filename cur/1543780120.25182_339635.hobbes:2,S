It's a very accurate one though.
The most common cause of this bug is that some buggy kernel module has been
unloaded.  It forgot to release its I/O region.  When you later come along
to look in /proc/ioports the kernel goes to fetch information from the
memory which is "owned" by the module which isn't there any more.  Crash.
So if you can identify which kernel module was loaded and then unloaded,
we'll fix it up.
