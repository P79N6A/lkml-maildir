I suspect this could relate to this commit:
commit 62bc060b8ed5fcdafd87da5ab17bdd59a39ebcc9
Author: Mattias Nissler <mattias.nissler@gmx.de>
Date:   Mon Nov 12 15:03:12 2007 +0100
    rt2x00: Allow rt61 to catch up after a missing tx report
Could you revert that patch, rebuild, and try to recreate the problem?
Thanks!
John
