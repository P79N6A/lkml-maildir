Except for the case when a device is physically swapped before ->remove()
which is really, really, nasty.  But it is quiet unlikely anyone will
actually be that fast.  Whatever talks to the hardware has to check to
see if it's device  is present.  But if usb is anything like PCI it 
should be a very inexpensive check to see if a driver is present.  And
writes to a non-existent device should be safe.
Splitting ->remove() into quiet() and ->removed() will be racy.  So
unless there is shown to be a compelling reason to do the split I
don't want to go there.  It appears easier to write correct code
with a single ->remove() method than two separate methods in the
hot-plug case.
