As of 2.1.131, Quake II had a glitch when using the OSS/Free driver for my
SB32PnP.  If I ran quake before anything opened the sound device, it would
work fine.  Running it a second time, or running something as simple as mpg123,
and quake2 spits out:
------- sound initialization -------
/dev/dsp: Device or resource busy
Could not open /dev/dsp
------- Loading ref_soft.so -------
Does anyone know if this is fixed yet in 2.2.0pre*ac*?
Also, I've tried a patch by Daniel J. Rodriksson <djr@dit.upm.es>, that's
supposed to have fixed something simliar to this, but it doesn't work :/
Thanks,
Brian
