Even if wanting to support BIOSes that don't do "no emulation", all it
takes is simple initrd to locate and mount the iso9660 filesystem off the
real device - and that easily fits on a 2.88 MB floppy image used for
emulated floppy boot. Should also fit on an 1.44 MB image, although I've
not seen a BIOS yet that didn't like a 2.88 MB image on a CD.
