Yes.

Are you sure?
The Intel PPro documentation isn't very clear - but docu is never clear
about deficiencies of the product :-/

Are you sure?
The "Interrupt Acceptance Flow Chart for the Local APIC" doesn't contain
the "Interrupt Enabled" flag of the associated cpu.

arch/i386/kernel/irq.c:handle_IRQ_event() enables the interrupts very
early, far before we issue the EOI.

This is wrong: the arbitration priority register APR is used for the
priority backoff.
The local APIC uses 3 priority registers [APR, PPR, TPR], plus an "Arb
ID" as a tie breaker.
Chapter 7.4.10.6 (END-OF-INTERRUPT) is clearer:
[...EOI...]. This in an indication for the local APIC it can issue the
next interrupt, regardless of whether the current interrupt sercice has
been terminated or not. Note that interrupts whose priority is higher
than that currently in servce, do not wait for the EOI command
correspinging to the interrupt in service.
