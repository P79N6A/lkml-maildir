	Sorry, with so many drivers to patch, I went with a recommended
list of "interested parties".  I'll add you to that list.  It is posted
to linux-kernel in the hopes that interested persons do get a chance to
look at it.  I got no responses outside of my "interested parties" when
I posted this patch originally.  It's good to hear from you.

	Um, am I missreading: 
     59 static void wafwdt_ping(void)
     60 {
     61         /* pat watchdog */
     62         spin_lock(&wafwdt_lock);
     63         inb_p(WDT_STOP);
     64         inb_p(WDT_START);
     65         spin_unlock(&wafwdt_lock);
     66 }
I don't see it writing the new timeout.  Also, the semantic of
WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT (at least as I've implemented it in all the drivers
I've touched) is to ping the device to verify the new timeout is active.
	I also note that the calls to wafwdt_stop()/start() in the
open()/close() functions doesn't take the spinlock.  Granted, open() and
close() should be protected by wafwdt_is_open.
	If I add the locking, are you comfortable with the changes?
