mm1 worked.
to be clear, my append line looks like
append="gdb console=gdb pci=biosirq" and maybe some other stuff on there
to get my machine to boot in single processor mode, I have to add nosmp 
and acpi=off
if I don't add acpi=off I get apic errors on my cpus, as well as if I say 
noapic like the boot process says to, it says
amd errata #22 may be present.  in the event of instability boot with the 
noapic option
