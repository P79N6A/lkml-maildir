I haven't had time to go back and find where is started (my prior kernel 
was 2.6.15-rc7), but with 2.6.17-rc1/2/3/4 I've been running into a 
problem where when transfering large amounts of data (trying to ftp a TB 
or so of data off of the box to my new server it will run for a while (as 
little as 1G, as much as 45G) and then the network card will shut down.
when I say shut down I mean that it looses link and requires powering down 
the box (hard power down, not just power off from the front panel), 
disabling the network card in the BIOS, booting (as far as lilo is 
enough), powering down again, enabling the card and booting again.
there is no indication of trouble before the halt (it's transfering at 
full speed), the only think in the log is
May 11 22:23:57 david kernel: eth0: link down
May 11 22:24:00 david kernel: eth0: link up, 100Mbps, full-duplex, lpa 0xCDE1
May 11 22:24:22 david kernel: eth0: link down
if I don't do the disable/enable in the bios cycle and just power cycle 
the system the card does not initialize properly (ethtool reports 
autonegotiation disabled, 10Mb. will generate an 'unsupported' error if I 
try to enable the card)
the system is x86_64 64 bit kernel with 32 bit userspace
