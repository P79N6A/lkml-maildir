Yes, a little bit. Make dmidecode (or whatever you also need for
preparation steps that have to be done as root) a separate package,
which has to be installed before "make autoconfig" works, and write
that down in Documentation/Changes.
This gives you several benefits:
- you don't depend on the version of the /running/ kernel for "make
  autoconfig" to work (/dev/kmem is available for a /long/ time now).
- you can install and run dmidecode on one machine, copy the retrieved
  data to another machine and autoconfigure/build the kernel there.
Distributions can install the package by default, to make it work for
your grandmother as well, if that's what you want.
