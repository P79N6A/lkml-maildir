Hi guys,
	Stephen Rothwell pointed out that if you set up SIGIO from an
fd, fork, and exit, and PIDs wrap, the new process may be clobbered by
the SIGIO.  IMVHO the best way to clean this up is to check the
fasync_list in sys_close, and if pid == filp->f_owner.pid and fd ==
fasync_list->fa_fd, unregister the SIGIO.
	This means we need a move the "struct fasync_struct
fasync_list" into struct file (up from all the subsystems which use
it, eg. struct socket).
See any problems with this?
Rusty.
