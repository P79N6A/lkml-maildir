Weak undefined symbols used to work, certainly. The MTD code used them
for a while, before kaos imposed the inter_module_crap on it despite my
objections.

If another module is using a weak symbol, IIRC the module providing the
symbol _can't_ go away. I could be wrong -- I didn't use that
functionality. I was using get_symbol() and I added put_symbol() so I
could explicitly refcount it.
