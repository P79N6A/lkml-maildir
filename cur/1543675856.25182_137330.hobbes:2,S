hi all
this discussion has been up a few times, but I want it again. I _REALLY_ want 
to be able to kill processes in D state. I am aware of that this is not good, 
but compared to other parts of the linux kernel, there's quite a lot suicidal 
stuff there already, so why not. There is, for instance, in 2.5, the 
possibility to forcably remove loaded modules - FAR worse than merely killing 
a userspace process in D state.
So please, dear kernel people, Free Thy Users From Those Terrible Unreasonable 
Reboots.
regards
roy
