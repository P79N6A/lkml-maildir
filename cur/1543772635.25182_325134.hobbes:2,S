Unless I misunderstand what is suggested, for glibc to do that
internally would be vile. It'd have to override the signal handler for
every signal which is unmasked by the new signal mask, right?
That kind of trick makes some sense to use in an _application_ if the
author isn't expecting to run on a POSIX system and just use pselect(),
but for glibc to hack it up internally would be horrid.
