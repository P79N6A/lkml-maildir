OK, I understand you are suggesting to fork an experimental branch.  Then
I suggest that we stop this discussion in LKML and return to orinoco-devel
to discuss the situation.
There is nothing wrong with the fork if all other ways to keep the code
together have been exhausted.  But since this wasn't discussed in the
orinoco-devel mailing list, I think it's too early to fork.
One thing we haven't considered is restructuring the code to separate
common and different parts of the USB and the non-USB drivers.
The firmware issue has been solved in the 2.5 kernels, so it shouldn't
prevent David from including your code.
