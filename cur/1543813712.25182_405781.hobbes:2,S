Again, multiline sysfs modalias files are not going to happen. Find a
sane way to encode the list of devices into a single string, or don't do
it at all. And it must be available in the event environment too.

There is no need to rush out with this half-baken solution. This simple
udev rule does the job for you, if you want pnp module autoloading with
the current kernel:
  SUBSYSTEM=="pnp", RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'while read id; do /sbin/modprobe pnp:d$$id; done < /sys$devpath/id'"
Andrew, please make sure, that this patch does not hit mainline until
there is a _sane_ solution to the multiple id's exported for a single
device problem.
Thanks,
Kay
