Unless I misunderstand you, I'm not conviced... it get tty's 'stuck',
they never come right even after hours or days.

Yes, as far as the kernel is concerned this needs checking.
By comments (from before I got this email) and a pointer to the fix I
use...
I see unused tty's (such as tty4) and ioctl(..., VT_OPENQRY, ...)
returning numbers like 8 --- which agetty barfs on.
The solution I hacked up was to have agetty use vhangup on the tty and
not even use the ioctl which seems fragile at the best of time.  The
present patch is at:
	
http://stupidest.org/patches/util-linux-2.12-agetty-vhangup.001.patch
(ugly URL, sorry about that).
I've cc'd Andries Brouwer his his comments as he is the util-linux
maintainer.
Thanks,
