The patch titled
     resierfs: avoid tail packing if an inode was ever mmapped
has been added to the -mm tree.  Its filename is

Subject: resierfs: avoid tail packing if an inode was ever mmapped
From: Vladimir Saveliev <vs@namesys.com>
This patch fixes a confusion reiserfs has for a long time.
On release file operation reiserfs used to try to pack file data stored in
last incomplete page of some files into metadata blocks.  After packing the
page got cleared with clear_page_dirty.  It did not take into account that
the page may be mmaped into other process's address space.  Recent
replacement for clear_page_dirty cancel_dirty_page found the confusion with
sanity check that page has to be not mapped.
The patch fixes the confusion by making reiserfs avoid tail packing if an
inode was ever mmapped.  reiserfs_mmap and reiserfs_file_release are
serialized with mutex in reiserfs specific inode.  reiserfs_mmap locks the
mutex and sets a bit in reiserfs specific inode flags. 
reiserfs_file_release checks the bit having the mutex locked.  If bit is
set - tail packing is avoided.  This eliminates a possibility that mmapped
page gets cancel_page_dirty-ed.
