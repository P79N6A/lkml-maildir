Probably, I haven't tested it myself yet, so I don't know.

sony_acpi doesn't create this node. But if it is supported on your
system you should see 'method: name: GCDP' and 'method: name: SCDP'
in the logs because sony_acpi does enumerate all the methods it
finds for the snc device.
If you see it you can create the cdp entry with a bit of copy&paste
in the driver code...
