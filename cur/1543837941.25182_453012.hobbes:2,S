65535 sockets * 128 packets * 16384 bytes/packet = 
1^16 * 1^7 * 1^14 = 1^(16+7+14) = 1^37 = 128G of memory per IP
And systems with a lot of IP numbers are not unthinkable.
I wonder what kind of system you have to feel that that is not a
problem. (I'm not sure on the 128 packets per socket, and the 16k per
packet is considering jumbo frames without scather gather receive)

Hence the alternative allocator to use on tight memory conditions.
