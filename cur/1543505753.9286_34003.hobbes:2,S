All good points.  Alan's point about viruses is well-taken as well;
windows boxes have other routes through which bad things can enter their
boxes besides the network, and such network access as they have may well
open other virus-like routes.
I was merely trying to temper the notion that linux is really safe
either, or even necessarily safe-r.  To me the interesting thing is that
web-commerce exists at all, given the largely unexplored nature of the
risks associated with it.  Just because your browser is "secure" doesn't
mean at all that the transaction is.

I still favor the ssh model.  Really, even this is only as secure as the
host(s) you consider "trusted", but at least you can batten down various
hatches on a system that offers only sshd and perhaps sendmail as open
ports.  Although we are getting WAY off topic for the lists...;-)
The worst thing about SPAM to a list is the flurry of list traffic it
engenders.  If everybody just ignores it on the list (possibly sending
an acceptable use complaint quietly to the originating ISP with a few
threats:-) it has far less impact.
