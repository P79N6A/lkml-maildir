I've put up a -ide2 patch at
http://zeniv.linux.org.uk/~alan/IDE
This
	- cleans up old pci_module_init users
	- Should fix the crashes people saw when bmdma is zero
	- Adds the netcell driver (nothing clever in it yet as the chip
	  does all the thinking)
	- Fixed probe ordering
	- Added resource management to the pata_legacy driver
	- Other minor oddments (Allow CFA etc)
Should help fix some of the crashes reported on startup.
I did however forget to change the default ATA_ENABLE_PATA setting
