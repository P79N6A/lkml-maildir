Andries B. discovered that there is a jumper that allows one to select
between 15/16 hardwired head reporting.  They are shipped with the jumper
selected to 15 and you loose about 5% capacity.
Since the geometry rules for disk translations larger than 8.4GB do not
allow for 15 heads, he and I are discussing various options to account for
the error that IBM did.
The request is reasonable to add 15/16 combination, but the rule breaking
leaves us wondering some.  Since this is a geometry issue and Andries is
primarily responsible for that part of the kernel, I will defer to his
judgement.
If you have a list of drive models and names they could be useful for
determining the action needed to address the problem.
