Hi, 
I have a server with Debian woody stable (gcc 2.95.4, kernel 2.4.24, Intel 
Petium IV 2.4 GHz, 512 RAM, NIC: D-Link) working as gateway and, I have a 
problem with kernel, see the following: 
Mar 17 10:13:23 blackmarsh kernel: LIST_DELETE: ip_conntrack_core.c:302 
`&ct->tuplehash[IP_CT_DIR_REPLY]'(ddf5c414) not in &ip_conntrack_hash[hr]. 
After this message, the system be froze. I have noted that it only happen 
when the NIC counters reach the limit count (RX TX), all the traffic of my 
network, use it, the traffic is very high, I need restart the server in some 
nights (once on a week) before the NIC counter reach the limits... 
Somebody could tell me if the new kernel patch (2.4.25) repairs this error? 
thanks a lot!
