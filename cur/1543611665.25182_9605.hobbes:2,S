Check out the hotfixing code in NWFS.  It handles exactly what this 
long and drawn out thread has discussed, and it's already in 
Linux.  The code is contained in nwvp.c.  I can tell you 
that in the past three years of running NWFS on Linux and all
the time I worked at Novell from about 1996 on, I never once saw 
a server hotfix data after the newer "data guard" drive technologies
came out.  In fact, by default, I make the hotfix area on the drive
about .1 % of the total space, since it;s probably just wasted 
space at this point.  
It's just wasted space these days, but it is a good idea to keep it 
around, just in case the "pointless" argument turns out not to 
be pointless and someone gets eaten by a shark (1 in 100,000,000) at
the same instant they are struck by lightening (1 in 200,000,000).
