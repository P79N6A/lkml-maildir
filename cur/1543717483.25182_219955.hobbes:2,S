As far as I can tell this problem is related to your "/sbin/installkernel" 
script... it finds LILO and so calls it, but the lilo configuration file 
doesn't exist ;-)!
I think that "/sbin/installkernel" is doing the right thing (from its point 
of view)...
Shortly: REMOVE LILO, if you don't use it why is it installed?
Another thing you can do is to change "/sbin/installkernel" to never call 
LILO.
