But these are false alternatives!  "I'll give you a choice, I remove
either your right foot or your left arm.  Your choice."  The choice
of "neither" is not given.  All I want is true alternatives.  I
hope that one of those alternatives will be to opt out of the
coercive, advertising rich, commercial environment that is in
our future.
