        This is not true on any OS I'm aware of, including the
original sockets multicast implementation on early BSD.
        Multicast group membership is per-interface, not per-socket.
Joining a group on any socket on the machine allows packets for that
group to be delivered on the interface where it was joined.
Delivery of packets to a socket is determined by the binding, and
INADDR_ANY means "any".
IPv6 behaves the same way.
                                                                +-DLS
