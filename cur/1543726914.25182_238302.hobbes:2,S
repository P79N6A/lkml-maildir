I like this idea.  I'm trying to think of a way to skew
the "lottery" so small processes get an advantage, but
the only thing I can come up with is as follows:
1) when a process tries to grab the token, it "registers"
   itself
2) a subsequent process can "register" itself to get the
   token, but only if it has a better score than the
   process that already has it
3) the score can be calculated based on a few factors,
   like (a) size of the process (b) time since it last
   had the token
4) a simple formula could be (time / size), giving big
   processes the token every once in a blue moon and
   letting small processes have the token all the time
5) the token would be grabbed in pretty much the same way
   we do currently, except the token can be handed to
   another process instead of the current process, if there
   is a better candidate registered - all the locking is there
6) since there is only one candidate, we won't have any
   queueing complexities and the algorithm should be just
   as cheap as it is currently
What do you think ?
