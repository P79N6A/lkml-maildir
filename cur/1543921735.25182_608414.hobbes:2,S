Thanks for the reminder Ben.  Here it is again:
[IRQ]: Fix synchronize_irq races with IRQ handler
As it is some callers of synchronize_irq rely on memory barriers
to provide synchronisation against the IRQ handlers.  For example,
the tg3 driver does
	tp->irq_sync = 1;
	smp_mb();
	synchronize_irq();
and then in the IRQ handler:
	if (!tp->irq_sync)
		netif_rx_schedule(dev, &tp->napi);
Unfortunately memory barriers only work well when they come in
pairs.  Because we don't actually have memory barriers on the
IRQ path, the memory barrier before the synchronize_irq() doesn't
actually protect us.
In particular, synchronize_irq() may return followed by the
result of netif_rx_schedule being made visible.
This patch (mostly written by Linus) fixes this by using spin
locks instead of memory barries on the synchronize_irq() path.
