And SIGPWR is a bad choice anyway as the default action for SIGPWR
is to terminate the process - I can't see people being amused if all
their processes are killed when they suspend their laptop :-)
We could invent a new signal whose default action is ignore ... Solaris
has SIGFREEZE and SIGTHAW (the comment in the header file says used by CPR
- whatever that is).  SIGSUSPEND and SIGRESUME?
