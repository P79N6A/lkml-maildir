I think that temporarily allocating 1/32768th of total memory here is
reasonable, especially as it's not all allocated in a contiguous hunk.

I was a little saddened by the open-coded approach.  I'd expect that both
radix-trees and idr-trees could be used in this application.  Probably the
former.  (Radix-trees should have been designed from day one to store
`unsigned long's, not void*'s, so unless we change that, this application
will need to use typecasts when converting between void*'s and the stored
BITS_PER_LONG bitmaps).
