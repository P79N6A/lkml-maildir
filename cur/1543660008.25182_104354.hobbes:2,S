perfctr-2.4.4 is now available at the usual place:
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
Version 2.4.4, 2003-01-18
- Fixed a context-switch bug where an interrupt-mode counter could
  increment unexpectedly, and also miss the overflow interrupt.
- Fixed some ugly log messages the new HT P4 support code added
  in perfctr-2.4.3 could generate at driver initialisation time.
- Added preliminary support for AMD K8 processors with the
  regular 32-bit x86 kernel. The K8 performance counters appear
  to be identical or very similar to the K7 performance counters.
