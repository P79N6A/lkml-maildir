Yes.

You mean slabs, mempools etc will cause pages to be in active use ? Or
you mean that page cache will be filled up if there's lots of memory ?
That probably depends on the load on the system ... if you have a 
large memory system that's not heavily loaded, then don't we expect
lots of inactive pages ?

Depends on the way we look at it, and how we define the policy.
True, the page count is only accurate for the initial page struct in
terms of determining the number of references to the page, post allocation.
For the other pages, page count is only an indicator of whether it is
in use or not - the only user is the allocator, and the allocator will
only release them when the main page is released. No one else is
supposed to be using/holding those page structs directly.
To make any decisions about reference counting of the page etc, one 
should be looking at the first one, and nothing prevents that.
