Well, I've run badblocks in 2.4.16
results:
root@diego:~# badblocks -n -vv /dev/hdc5
Initializing random test data
Checking for bad blocks in non-destructive read-write mode
>From block 0 to 9671067
Checking for bad blocks (non-destructive read-write test): done
Pass completed, 0 bad blocks found.
root@diego:~#
It takes about 6 hours to check this...but perhaps I should repeat again
in 2.4.17-rc1.
It works in 2.4.16, but ls /hdc5/etc

This is my opinion:
	-Something (reiserfs, anything) has caused fs corruption
	-It should be repaired by reiserfsck, but it's broken :-((
	-This corruption should NOT have happened, reiserfsck shouldn't
have to be used.
	-I'm not a kernel hacker, so I can't try anything...what I know is
that
		/etc in hc5 doesn't work. /usr, /var....works correctly.
Well, I'd like to know what's happened in my drive. Can somebody try to
give an explanation?
