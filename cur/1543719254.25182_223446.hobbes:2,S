i think both are important. Dumping to disks is a frequent customer
request, and not all setups can dump to a network, for performance,
security or reliability reasons. The diskdump format is the same as the
netdump format, and can be handled/analyzed by the same userspace tools,
so in this sense it's an extension of netdump to another class of IO
devices.

that's what the patch does currently. It needs to be decided one way or
another. But it doesnt make alot of sense to introduce another vector of
APIs for this purpose - it would need possibly wide driver changes for
no good reason.
