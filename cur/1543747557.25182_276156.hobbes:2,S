Well, this one has taint from forced module load... If you can
reproduce it without that, it would be nice to decrease number of
modules in use, perhaps one of them is a problem?

The second is oops in uart resume code, I guess some serial person
needs to debug this one.

Well, for me external firewire disk does not even work *before*
suspend, so... :-). [I get something like 10KB/sec transfer rate,
which means unusable disk.]
