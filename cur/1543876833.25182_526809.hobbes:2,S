I think it has to be done.  But that's not so trivial.  What happens if
all the CPUs a process was supposed to be runnable on vanish.
Shouldn't, if no affinity mask is defined, new processors be added?  I
agree that if the process has a defined affinity mask no new processors
should be added _automatically_.

You mean because it's only a factor of two?  Well, it's not once you
count the whole overhead.
