Looks like there are still problems with dependencies on networking.
If I start with allnoconfig and just enable CONFIG_PCI,
CONFIG_PCI_MSI, CONFIG_INFINIBAND, CONFIG_IPATH_CORE and
CONFIG_INFINIBAND_IPATH, the build ends with:
      LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `ipath_free_pddata': undefined reference to `kfree_skb'
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `ipath_alloc_skb': undefined reference to `__alloc_skb'
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `ipath_kreceive': undefined reference to `skb_over_panic'
    drivers/built-in.o: In function `ipath_init_chip': undefined reference to `kfree_skb'
Should I just make IPATH_CORE depend on NET as well?
