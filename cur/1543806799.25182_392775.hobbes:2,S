No.  In my implementation the nested pid space has one pid that essentially
looks like a threaded process.  So ps and top can see that something is there
but you aren't spammed with all of the pids.  In addition for top the cpu utilization
for all of the pids are shown for that one pid (just like the thread group leader of
on a threaded process).  So there is no confusion.
If you want the detailed information you can either chroot to an environment
where the appropriate version of /proc is available.  Or you can modify your
tools.

There areas.
1) Checkpointing.
2) Isolation for security purposes.
   There may be secrets that the sysadmin should not have access to.
3) Nesting of containers, (so they are general purpose and not special hacks).
The vserver way of solving some of these problems is to provide a way
to enter the guest.  I would rather have some explicit operation that puts
you into the guest context so there is a single point where we can tackle
the nested security issues, than to have hundreds of places we have to
look at individually.
