I have no problem with this, but I want to point out one
artifact of the current Radeon driver which drivers me nuts
:-)
The radeon_screen_blank() routine returns error codes back
to the X server which handily confuses it, making it
impossible to unblank the screen unless X has taken it
all the way to power-off or somesuch.  The comment above
this problematic code states:
	/* let fbcon do a soft blank for us */
	return (blank == FB_BLANK_NORMAL) ? -EINVAL : 0;
There has to be a better way to do this, which doesn't break
X when run via fbcon. :-)
