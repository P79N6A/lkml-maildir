And that does not work if you build against a non-running kernel.
You force a two step (two reboots!!) procedure for a kernel upgrade.
Say I use alsa drivers. If I jump from kernel 2.4.18 to 2.4.19
I have to:
- build 2.4.19
- boot on 2.4.19 (without alsa and a ton of messages about failed
  sound services)
- build alsa
- boot again
I really hate that 'uname -r'. As far as /usr/src/linux has _nothing_
to do with current system (glibc has its own headers), you can always
suppose that /usr/src/linux is the source of the kernel you are working
with (building, hacking, wahtever), and that it is different from what
you run. So a kernel upgrade is just
- build 2.4.19 (on /usr/src/linux-2.4.19, and /usr/src/linux symlinks to it)
- build alsa against /usr/src/linux
- reboot and alehop, done in _one_ step.
Where to install the out-of-tree module ? Get the version you are building
against from /usr/src/linux/include/version.h:
KREL:=$(shell grep UTS_RELEASE /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h | cut -d\" -f2)
You can always not-to-hardcode kernel location using something like:
LINUX=/usr/src/linux
KREL=$(shell grep UTS_RELEASE $(LINUX)/include/linux/version.h | cut -d\" -f2)
CFLAGS=-nostdinc -I$(LINUX)/include
MODDIR=/lib/modules/$(LINUX)/my_private_dir
I use this for adding nvidia and bproc to a kernel and works fine.
Just one reboot per upgrade.
