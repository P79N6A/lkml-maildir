Have you followed this thread? I can very well imagine what kind of a mess it
may be to get a patch accepted "upstream".
In fact I would have dropped this idea, too.

Sometimes forking is unavoidable and necessary. On Joergs side things are
pretty easy. All he has to tell the people is that according to the version
spec they sent he refuses to help them, because they use a forked version.
The true story behind may be that nobody wants to use his version for certain
pecularities and that therefore merely no feedback is reaching him (any more).

Don't try to press politics onto distros. See what they really are: companies.
All companies want to earn bucks, that's what they are for.
If you don't like that, use debian. You got the choice, that's the fine part
about it.
