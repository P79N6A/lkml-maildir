OK.  I found a few more.
When umounting, shrink_dcache_sb() will produce a 3-4 ms. bump.  However
it's not clear this can be made preemptible.  AFAICT the whole thing
needs to be under the dcache_lock.  This one is pretty obvious so I'm
not attaching a trace.
There's also still one path in the VM related to page freeing that can
produce ~500 usec latencies but I don't have a trace handy now.

OK, great.
