Hi,
   I know that ktimer is not yet part of the main tree of the Linux kernel.
However, maybe someone can help me to understand why the following code in a 
module makes crash my x86_64.
Many thanks,
             Claudio
struct ktimer mytimer;
void myfunction()
{
        int i;
}
static int module_insert(void)
{
   ktime_t mytime = ktime_set(1,0);
   mytimer.function = myfunction;
   mytimer.data = NULL;
   ktimer_init(&mytimer);
   ktimer_start(&mytimer, &mytime, KTIMER_REL);
   //...
}
