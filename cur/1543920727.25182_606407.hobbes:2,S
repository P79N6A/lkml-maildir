How about a static code tool that will check for initialization races?
yesterday I found a lurker bug in some of my code that wouldn't have
been exposed had not tripped over it.  I wrote some infrastructure code
that initializes its lists and notification trees in late_init.  
Then I found  out that there was as client of my infrastructure calling
my register API at core_init time.  It didn't crash / fail noticeably,
but wasn't correct, because at that time I was using a static array. 
When I changed my code to use an array of pointers instead it went boom!
(FWIW I've fixed this issue for now...)
It made me feel uneasy how that issue got by un-noticed and I worry that
there could be more like it.  A tool to scan the code for boot up init
calls and check for any callers into any module for entry before the
module is fully initialized.
