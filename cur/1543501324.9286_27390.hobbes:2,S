Subject: do_bottom_half() vs. interrupt flag

the top of linux/kernel/softirq.c has the following comment:
 * do_bottom_half() runs at normal kernel priority: all interrupts
 * enabled.  do_bottom_half() is atomic with respect to itself: a
 * bottom_half handler need not be re-entrant.
to me, this seems to imply that do_bottom_half() should only
be called when interrupts are enabled (and indeed that seems
to be the case).  however, do_bottom_half looks like this:
	asmlinkage void do_bottom_half(void)
	{
	        int cpu = smp_processor_id();
	        if (softirq_trylock(cpu)) {
	                if (hardirq_trylock(cpu)) {
	                        __sti();
	                        run_bottom_halves();
	                        __cli();
	                        hardirq_endlock(cpu);
	                }
	                softirq_endlock(cpu);
	        }
	}
just prior to run_bottom_halves(), interrupts get explicitly
enabled (__sti()).  why is that?
also, on exit, interrupts are explicity disabled (__cli()).
this step appears to be incorrect.
any comments?
