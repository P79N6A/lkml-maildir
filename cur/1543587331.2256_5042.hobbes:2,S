I don't think that it's necessary bad.

Agreed, but that's
	a) a separate story
	b) not the case in situation mentioned above (all inodes are
busy).

Maybe, but I really doubt that constant pressure on dcache/icache is a
good idea. I'd rather see what will change from fixing that bug in
prune_dcache() before deciding what to do next.

Umm... Probably.
