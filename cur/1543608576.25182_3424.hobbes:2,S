As I am sure you are beginning to suspect, you need to NOT hold locks in
tasks that can sleep which are also accessed from an interrupt context
(bottom_half).  Among the locks that allow (or even force) sleeping are
the "up" "down" locks.  These must NOT be used from the interrupt
context.  Locks that can be used from the interrupt context are the
spinlocks.  Of these you would need to use the "irq" versions.  In this
group you will also find the read/ write locks which allow several
readers at a time, while writers are given exclusive access.
If you must allow sleeping locks, you will have to promote the interrupt
code to a kernel task which can sleep.  This is done using wait queues. 
There are various versions of these, but they all end up having the
"consumer" sleep until the "producer" calls "wake_up".  Again, there are
various wrappers that can be used here.  The key is that the interrupt
context calls the "wake_up" side and the kernel task calls the sleep
side.
Then you will most likely need to use one of the spinlock_irq locks to
synchronize the interrupt context with the kernel task, but remember,
the kernel task must NOT sleep while holding a spinlock.
This is an overview.  You can find much more detail in the
kernel-hacking-HOWTO

or try Google.
