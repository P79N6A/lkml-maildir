Allowing a server on a dynamic IP range to act as a mail server is what is
stupid.  Most email blockers also block dynamic IP ranges since these
systems are typically the ones most commonly infected, and the RBL
databases.  They just use a different technique, they base it on DNS maps
of internet address ranges, and not behavior.  It will only block the smtp
port for these systems -- and mail servers originating from dynamic ranges
should be blocked anyway -- and are by most commercial email gateway
boxes.
