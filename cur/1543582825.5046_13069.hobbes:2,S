They aren't set to anything because they are not sysctl
"values", they are sysctl "limits".  Ie. they tell the sysctl
layer what legal range the user's setting of a particular sysctl
must reside in.
The fix is to enclose these things in CONFIG_SYSCTL, which I have
done in my tree, thanks for bringing this to my attention.
