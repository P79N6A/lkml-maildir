As I understand it, xip avoids the page cache copy. But tmpfs already
lives in the page cache (or swap), so avoiding that "copy" is
impossible. But I always expected tmpfs to implicitly due its own kind
of xip, i.e. that it doesn't have to store its stuff in the page cache
twice. Are you saying that this isn't true?
According to Documentation/filesystems/xip.txt the ramdisk driver does
something similar, pushing the data into the page cache and discarding
the original data.
thanks,
Björn
