i was thinking about this... my brute force idea:
make some very early init scripts manipulate a bunch of symlinks, based on the 
output of uname -r. you have a different kernel, it renames some dirs, and 
goes on as normal. in fact, you oughta be able to have a few separate init 
script kits that all run but immediately exit if their designated kernel 
isn't running, like  `uname -r`= "2.6.6-test1" || exit
