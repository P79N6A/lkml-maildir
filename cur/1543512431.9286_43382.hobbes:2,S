o if by "worse" you mean slower then probably yes, it isn't "slower"
o otoh it is "wrong", see below
o not to mention preempting a thread for another w/ same dynamic priority
  is "wrong" -- the task switch overhead isn't justified
o RT tasks have static priorities, and would also be affected
o i don't see how this "simplifies" the code

You said it above:

now, what happens if there is a SCHED_FIFO thread w/ priority=50 running
and another one becomes runnable?...

what "special case for prev"? ;) You just traded one check for
another...

There is code like this (example from __get_free_pages()):

this assumes the SCHED_YIELD flag will prevent the current task from
being selected if there's anything else to run. Other than being
"wrong" from a modular pov, it's also wrong because that's not what
SCHED_YIELD actually does. Not even in the stock scheduler...
(this btw means that Richards sched_yield() change is wrong -- normal
threads will _not_ be selected even if a RT task has SCHED_YIELD set)
My plan was to add a schedule_others() call and kill all SCHED_YIELD
use outside of the scheduler, but i haven't gotten around to that yet.
Other than this, the patch is as minimal as it gets -- it simplifies
the code (read: the generated code is better (smaller/faster) than 
the original) while fixing many bugs at the same time. (not to mention
all /this-is-subtle/ parts are gone, and the code appears at least
maintainable)
If anybody can see any problems left with the scheduler i'd certainly
like to know...
