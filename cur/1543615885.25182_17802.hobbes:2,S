As usual, Al has hit the highpoints (five lines vs. >> 1000 msgs of proc
flamewars over time).  At risk of boring regular readers, I shall expand:
There is /proc, and /proc/sys.  /proc is a pain to use in the kernel (seq_*
made this better recently, but far from perfect), but is flexible.
/proc/sys (aka sysctl) is easier to use, but a PITA for dynamic entries.
The "manual formatting" nature of /proc entries has lead to (c) mentioned by
Al.  This can be alleviated by making the simplest method of exporting data
the correct one (ie. more like /proc/sys).
The tree layout issues are more complicated.  In particular, the following
namespaces should be equivalent:
   Boot command line: 3c509.debug=1
   Module parameter: insmod 3c509 debug=1
   proc entry: echo 1 > .../3c509/debug
Finally, I consider the granularity issue a red-herring: if it's in the
kernel, it should be in a logical location.
Now, I have a sample patch for a simple "/proc/sys" replacement which follows
the "one value per file" (similar to the current proc/sys) and
"dynamic is easy" principle (required for widespread use).  I also have
module loader rewrite and boot param unification patches.

Important to realize that we will be stuck with the current interfaces for
another stable kernel version (backwards compatibility is a WIP).
Once Linus accepts general patches again I shall start pushing things to
him.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
