Hi Jens,
I applied your patch to 2.4.4-pre4. It compiled fine, but crashed during
boot (just right after the IDE init) with
-------------------
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.12
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
printing eip: ...
Oops: 0000
...
-------------------
I looked up the eip. It's in 
c01a5490 t cdrom_get_entry
c01a5490 t gcc2_compiled.
(Although I don't know what the second line on the same address means.) 
Please let me know, if you need more info or I can help in any other way.
Thanks,
Stefan
