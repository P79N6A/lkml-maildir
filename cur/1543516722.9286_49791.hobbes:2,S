	I have had that recently with all 2.2 kernels up to 2.2.12-20
	(RH 5.2, RH 6.0, RH 6.1). Most of the time, the server was
	not so loaded (in fact, other machines had no trouble with
	it). What is sure is that the client could not recover from
	that situation.
	Another thing I have seen is a problem with autofs (at least
	I believe it is related to autofs). Could there be a race
	condition when an access is done to a remote NFS partition exactly
	at the same time autofs attempts to umount it. When that happens,
	every access to that 'not yet mounted' partition is blocked.
	The only way to recover is to reboot the machine. Quite annoying
	with a mail server checking for .forward files...
