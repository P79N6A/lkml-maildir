 Is "largely re-written" an overstatement?  The SMP from 2.0 to 2.2
 was "largely re-written."  Most of the SMP locking code through
 2.3.x has been refined.  I gather that the network devices and 
 code path have been "unserialized."

 [moved a bullet point -- unserialized net is more interesting
  in the server/enterprise context]
   - The new netfilter code replaces "ipchains" with the most 
     flexible and modular packet filtering available.  
   - Policy based routing and quality of server (QoS) queueing and 
     packet scheduling allows Linux systems to precisely control
     the flow of data through the system and into and out of your
     networks. 
   - FreeS/WAN and CIPE (available via international patches) provide
     kernel level support for transparent network cryptography.
   - These (previous three) features make Linux the 
     ideal kernel for building custom routers.
   - Support for very high speed (gigabit) ethernet and other
     (FDDI, HIPPI) network interfaces.

 Let's not forget StrongARM/ARM, MIPS, 68k (including the 
 Coldfire and Dragonball processors in that family).  These are 
 used in many embedded systems (including many PDAs).
 (Palm Pilot is Dragonball, moving to StrongARM?)

 [moved bullet point, see previous comment]
   - Linux is also well suited to many laptop, mobile and embedded
     applications.  There is additional support for Transmeta's
     new line of "Crusoe (TM)" low-power consumption x86 processors
     which are powering web pads and long running "work all day" 
     laptops.
 [Okay, shameless plug for our favorite kernel hacker's employer
  --- but still a feature].
   - ACPI support builds on the advanced power management 
     (APM) features from earlier kernel versions.
   - The new Linux kernel now has integrated PCMCIA and Cardbus
     support (long available as an "add-on" patch).  Also included
     is support for a number of wireless networking products and
     protocols, for "untethered" convenience.

 The Linux developers sarcastically acknowlege Mindcraft and 
 thank them for their efforts in helping us identify the need
 for these improvements.
 Also the "kernel-level web server" is better described as a 
 kernel level web "accelerator."  That is more accurate, and it
 is less likely to scare off business users who have already
 chosen a web server/daemon.
>> - Logical Volume Manager for easy administration of disk space,
>>   including adding, deleting, and resizing disk slices on the fly.
  - "Capabilities" support extends the UNIX security model and
    allows Linux to provide more fine-grained access to system
    privileged.  The "capabilities bounding set" further allows
    the administrator to "lock down" their system and prevent
    persistent changes, even in the face of "rogue" applications.
 [It's an oversimplification, but it's never been mentioned in
  previous press releases and "Wonderful World" revisions.]

 Did the list ever decide on reiserfs?  In or out?
 (I'd prefer to put it in, marked as EXPERIMENTAL, for what
 it's worth, PLEASE, no more flamefest on it; I just want to know).
