See previous threads.
The include should be in linux/sysdev.h.  The reason this has come up is
because the ARM changes got merged before the generic changes, so there's
currently a minor disparity with the calling convention for system
device suspend methods.
IOW, when sysdev.h is updated to prototype the function pointer with
pm_message_t, this'll also be solved.
Therefore, if anything, linux/pm.h should be added to linux/sysdev.h as
the minimal patch.
