In the real world a process' state is influenced by code I have little
control over, usually glibc and other libraries, and fork(). Using (3)
I can inspect parts of my process' state that I did not initialize myself.

No, it means that x86-64's ia32 emulation was implemented by someone
who either didn't realize the difference, or didn't care (because
"only glibc matters").

Sure.

The TLS base can obviously be zero.
User-space asks to access TLS #n (for allocs #n can be -1).
The kernel maps that to GDT index #m.
The kernel stores #m in the user-space buffer.
User-space maps #m to a selector.

I have said nothing that would prevent the use of sparse TLS GDT indices.
Look, I'm not saying the current API is perfect, far from it. But it does
have valid usage modes which are broken in x86-64's ia32 emulation, and
will break on i386 of you reallocate the TLS GDT indices. This is a fact.
This is why I'm asking that if you change things (thus breaking binary
compatibility even more), that a corrected API be placed in new syscalls.
That is, instead of forcing user-space to do
   uname
   if (version >= 2.6.N)
      call {set,get}_thread_area with new-style parameters
   else
      call {set,get}_thread_area with old-style parameters
it should do
   call new_{set,get}_thread_area with new-style parameters
   if (ENOSYS)
     call old_{set,get}_thread_area with old-style parameters
