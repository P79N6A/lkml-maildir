This is actually a Linux limitation -- we're pretty bad at dealing with
64-bit BARs on 32-bit architectures.  There's two interfaces to get
at it -- ioremap() and set_fixmap().  Both of these interfaces take an
unsigned long to describe a physical address.

MCFG isn't described in any released version of the ACPI spec, so I
don't know whether it's even possible for it to be a 64-bit address.
There's a reserved field that might be used for the upper 32 bits.
