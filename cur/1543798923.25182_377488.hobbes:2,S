Maxtor -> Seagate: manageable load (2min on/2min off)
USB -> Seagate: looks ok for about 15-30seconds and load starts
   climbing. I stopped the cp at approx 50 and it kept on climbing until
   it hit 93 and then started backing off. It's been maybe 5 minutes and
   the server still has not recovered though the load is still dropping
   (I can tell it has not recovered yet as the queue keeps on climbing -
   in the m->s side of things the queue begins dropping off almost
   immediately) - reads from disks are slow (10 seconds to read an 88
   entry die with ls -la and possible longer to write a 1k text file
   that was just opened). About 4-5 minuts later still the queue finally
   starts to drop.
Maxtor -> USB: just fine.
Not sure if this is of interested. The kernel may well be too old to
make it so. It may be that not even the io scheduler is at issue but the
behaviour looks so similar to that of the raid rebuild behaviour I
described that I figured I'd follow up.
If it's of no interest then I'll drop it.
