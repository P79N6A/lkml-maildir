Probably the same as my patch did.
I've talked to Don Becker about, we have an idea of a solution, I'm just
waiting to see what happens.
Note - if your using tulip based cards, you will see problems when you
pull the cable out.
Oh, what is the possible solution?
We talked about using the IFF_RUNNING flag - if your plugged into the
network, and connection is good (ie, 100BaseT, you've got a carrier
detected), you get IFF_RUNNING.  If the carrier drops, IFF_RUNNING is
removed (network connection is gone - you can't run anymore, since the
resource has disappeared!)
Only one major problem with this - no driver implements it yet.
