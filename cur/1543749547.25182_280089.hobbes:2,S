Just for the record (in case people see this in the archive and wonder 
what the solution was) - the drive has had a steadily shorter uptime 
over the past few days. When I re-ran WD diagnostics, it finally found a 
problem with the drive, so I'm going to be exchanging it and hopefully a 
new drive will fix the problem.
