Hi,
Is it possible for a user process to post a message to kernel or 
any task running inside the kernel using message queues.
If so how to get the ID of the kernel's message queue.
Is there any way that a kernel can share its message queue with 
user process.
I request that the answer or response be personally CC'd to me at 
the id lavanya_nl@rediffmail.com.
Thanx in advance
regards
N.Lavanya
