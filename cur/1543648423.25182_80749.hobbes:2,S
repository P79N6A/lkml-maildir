The stack issues were a major problem in the 5.3x series driver.  I
believe, I can check tomorrow, 5.38.9 (the driver Dell distributes)
contains fixes for the stack clobbering -- qla2x00-rh1-3 also contain
the fixes.
IAC, I believe the support tech working with MasterLee had asked 
for additional information regarding the configuration as well as
some basic logs.  Ideally we'd like to setup a similiar configuration
in house and see what's happening...
