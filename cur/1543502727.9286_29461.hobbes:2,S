	Jamie, look into the file in question. There sits an implementation
of dual caching. fs may use its own key (of arbitrary size - icache
doesn't care) and completely avoid iget(). Not messing with icache
behaviour.

Yes, it is. Internally FAT uses the directory entry location as the key.
Glue in fs/fat/inode.c allows icache to keep constant i_ino and have its
way wrt purging, etc. IIRC I've posted a description of this stuff on
linux-fsdevel back in April or May. Look through archives - fsdevel is not
too noisy.
