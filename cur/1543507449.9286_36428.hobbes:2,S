Ah, I see the problem now. I have never properly analysed this condition
before, as many TCP stacks have real connect problems (e.g. if you keep
trying to connect to a non-existent machine the connection sometimes
completes and enters the closed state, as shown on a netstat listing) so
this problem has been lost in the noise.
Is the only way to avoid this problem to check the randomly allocated
port number to see if it matches the target port, or is there a more
structured way?
