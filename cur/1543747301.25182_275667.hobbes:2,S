I firmly believe the opposite. When a userspace process calls the kernel 
which (directly or indirectly) calls the userspace filesystem, the 
filesystem must have elevated priviledges, or it can deadlock when 
calling back in.

As others have mentioned, they are limited in the number of pages they 
are allowed to dirty.

I don't see a theoretical problem, just some practical ones.
All can be overcome IMO, and it would be well worth it, too.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
