Maybe you want to have a look at the bootdisks I created. See on my linux
web page:
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/
Your kernel needs nothing but the drivers to access the root filesystem. It
then calls /sbin/init and -- in case of failure -- tries /etc/init,
/bin/init and /bin/sh.
You can pass the init=... parameter to override this.
In order to execute the binary, the kernel needs support for ELF (or
whatever format you want to use) binary format. Probably your binary
is dynamically linked, so you need /lib/ld-linux.so.X (X=1 or 2) and
/lib/libc.so.X (X=5 or 6)
You probably need a shell, libtermcap and some utilsand the reqeuired
libraries.
