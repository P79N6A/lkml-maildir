BARs above 4G on i386 raise all sorts of issues.  I think Grant's
original patch (which changes phys_addr in drivers/pci/msi.c to
unsigned long) is correct as it stands, because the MSI code is going
to use that address to ioremap() the MSI-X table.  And the address
passed to ioremap is unsigned long anyway.
Some extension like ioremap_pfn() or something like that is going to
needed to handling giving the kernel access to BARs above 4G on 32-bit
archs.
