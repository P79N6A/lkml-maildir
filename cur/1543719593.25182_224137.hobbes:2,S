The web-based mailer that I used for
submitting these behaves the same for
all Windows mailers including X11
Konqueror, X11 whatever Red Hat's
latest browser is, and XP IE.

Good detective work.  I guess you were
looking in a mirror.

That's why my first posting proposed a
method of getting the necessary results
without using floating-point hardware,
and my third posting reminded another
non-reader that my first posting said
what it said.
But then someone named Linus something-
or-other posted a reply saying that it
actually is possible to use the
floating-point hardware, within
some constraints.  But don't worry about
that, you didn't read my postings and
you won't read his.
Now I see why everyone hates you.
