This is no more and no less the same situation that we have with
the kernel-doc documented functions/data in the kernel.
I like the concept that the description is kept close to the actual
usage, the tool support and that in general looks like ordinary
kernel-doc documentation.
And if people do not dare to update the kernel-doc documentation of
a function then maybe they should not send patches in first place..
If we then really want to have the important printk's documented
is another story.
