Bingo.
I don't have a floppy and floppy support is disabled in the BIOS.
And thinking about it, I had exactly the same problem in -mm three 
months ago (the thread subject was "2.6.8-rc4-mm1 doesn't boot").
(I didn't think it might be the same problem again since this was so
 long ago...).
It seems Bjorns "PCI: remove unconditional PCI ACPI IRQ routing" was 
merged now into your tree, but his patch to fix floppy.c wasn't 
merged...
