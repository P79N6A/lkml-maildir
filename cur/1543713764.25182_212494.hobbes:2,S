No sign of anything related to the keyboard.

Well, maybe, but I was using all of the previous 2.6.x _with_ the preepmtion 
enabled and nothing like this happened before.

Look, I've been using different variants of the 2.6.x kernels on this very 
machine/distro since early 2.6.0-test and I hadn't seen _anything_ like this 
before 2.6.5-rc2 (then I saw something like this first).  I _really_ don't 
think it's a distribution-related issue.
