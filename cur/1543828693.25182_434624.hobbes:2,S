I don't really understand the complaint.  If <rare condition applies>,
say Y, otherwise say N.  If unsure, say Y.  The default is N.  Perhaps
all that's needed is to spell out the implications of saying Y?  How
about:
	  This option allows 32-bit systems to support files larger than
	  2 Terabytes, at a cost of increased kernel memory usage.  Most
	  people do not need the overhead and should answer N to this
	  question, but if you do not understand this question, answering
	  Y is safest.
Or is that too verbose?
NB: Anyone suggesting that we should say "Tibibytes" instead of
Terabytes there will be hunted down and brutally slain.  That is all.
