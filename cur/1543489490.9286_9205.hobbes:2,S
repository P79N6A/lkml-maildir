If this is the wrong mailing list for this topic, please send me info
on where to get help, not flames because I'm off topic.
I am trying to get 2.2.2 running on my system.  I upgraded all my
software to at least the levels specified in Documentation/Changes.
I ran: make menuconfig, make dep, make clean, make bzImage,
make modules, make modules_install in that order.  I moved System.map
and bzImage to my boot directory and modified lilo.conf, ran lilo -v.
I booted the kernel and insmod will not load any of the modules.
It spits out  many unresolved symbols for each module I try.  I
think I did everything right.  The modules are there under
/lib/modules/2.2.2.
I have searched dejanews on this and many people have reported this 
problem but no-one has posted a reason or solution.
Any help would sure help...
