Matt, this looks ok (at least it boots on my test system).  I wasn't
able test it on a very large system though, but it looks functionally
identical to the patch in Andrew's tree.  Btw, you probably want to put
() around NODEZONE_SHIFT + ZONES_SHIFT in page_nodenum() otherwise gcc
will complain loudly.
