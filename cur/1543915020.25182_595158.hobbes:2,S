This type of action makes sense in the context of Andrea's approach and
large blocks. I don't think it makes sense today to do it in the general
case, at least not yet.

I'll play around with it on the side and see what sort of results I get.
I won't be pushing anything any time soon in relation to this though.
For now, I don't intend to fiddle more with grouping pages by mobility
for something that may or may not be of benefit to a feature that hasn't
been widely tested with what exists today.

No, which on those systems, I would suggest setting min_free_kbytes to a
higher value. Doesn't work as well on IA-64.

Movable, unmovable, reclaimable and reserve in the current incarnation
of grouping pages by mobility.

Mostly done as you suggest already. Dentry are considered reclaimable, not
long-lived though and are grouped with things like inode caches for example.

More groups = more cost although very easy to add them. A mixed type
used to exist but was removed again because it couldn't be proved to be
useful at the time.

And if the groups are 1GB in size? I tried something like this already.
It didn't work out well at the time although I could revisit.

hence, increase min_free_kbytes.

What you suggest sounds similar to having a type MIGRATE_MIXED where you
allocate from when the preferred lists are full. It became a sizing
problem that never really worked out. As I said, I can try again.

Using GFP flags to identify the type.

Age is difficult to determine so probably not.

We bias the location of unmovable and reclaimable allocations already. It's
not done for movable because it wasn't necessary (as they are easily
reclaimed or moved anyway).
