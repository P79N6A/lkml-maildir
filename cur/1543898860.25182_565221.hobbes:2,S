Thanks for your reply. Please, just call me Nigel :). I saw a patch that Dave 
Hansen had posted, back around the time of 2.6.11 iirc. It was for x86, and 
(so far as I understand) allowed a person who doesn't really have 
hotpluggable memory to make their computer pretend that it does.
Just in case I'm not being clear enough, let me get more concrete. I have had 
some code for a while that uses bitmaps to simulate page flags, without 
needing to take up those precious bits in page->flags. I've begun to add 
support for memory hotplugging, in the hope that I can make it general enough 
that it will be useful for more than just suspend2. To do that, I'd like to 
be able to test the memory hotplugging paths, without needing to actually 
have hotpluggable memory. I do have an x86 desktop I could work on, but would 
prefer to do it on my x86_64 laptop if I can.
Regards,
Nigel
