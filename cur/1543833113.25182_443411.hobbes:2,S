In my opinion, HZ needs to be a constant, since otherwise you could
break perfectly fine existing code (e.g., code which statically
initializes a variable with HZ and then picks up the correct frequency
from sysconf) and if you have to pick a particular constant, it seems
reasonable to me to pick the most commonly used frequency (which
appears to be 250Hz at the moment).
