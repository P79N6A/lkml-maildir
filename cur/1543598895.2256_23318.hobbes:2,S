You may keep your binaries in flash on system like that.

What I am saying is that I do *not* want to transport source
etc. every time I want to make a kernel change. And no I *cannot* just
put Python on it if I a) don't have the space or b) haven't brought up
Python on the system yet.
I am not speaking of any new systems I am working on right now, I am
speaking from my experience bringing up systems such as the m68k and
ia64.

As I have pointed out, it *is* indeed a problem to kernel developers
who are actually working on bringing up systems. Most of the people
who argue in favor of the Python dependency have never tried bringing
up a system.
