Well, I've found something more, didn't notice it before: The modem codec
isn't detected correctly any more. With 2.4.1, the log showed the
following:
kernel: ac97_codec: AC97 Modem codec, id:  0x5349:0x4c27 (Unknown)
and now it is:
kernel: ac97_codec: AC97 codec, id: 0x0000:0x0000 (Unknown)
So somehow it fails to detect the vendor and device id for the codec.
