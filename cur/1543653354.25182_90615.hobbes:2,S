I'm not so sure.  If the epoll documentation were clear enough
(which at the moment, frankly, it isn't), I think
there's a good chance users would not be confused
by the difference between level-triggered and edge-triggered
events.
I'd be happy to contribute better doc... has the man page
for sys_epoll been written yet?
