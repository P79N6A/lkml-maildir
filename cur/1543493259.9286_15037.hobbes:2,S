Hello,
I still don't see the need for more than the sticky bit if you introduce:
- remove sticky bit on write (solves user giving himself caps)
- Introduce a nosticky mount option that is the default
   (solves the problem of going from an old to a cap-enabled kernel and
   importing data from untrusted external sources (floppy mount, nfs mount
   etc.))
