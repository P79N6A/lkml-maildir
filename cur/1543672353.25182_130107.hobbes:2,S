With APIC at least it doesnt suprise me the least. The IRQ hack seems
extremely racey. Remember on most systems (especially with PIII type
APIC) IRQ delivery is asynchronous to the bus so you get
IRQ arrives
			sound card
			loop
				clean up IRQ
IRQ sent
				still more work, do it
			done
			HANDLED
IRQ arrives
			sound card
			Umm duh no work for me
			NOT HANDLED
		Whine
For anything where you get pairs of close IRQ's
