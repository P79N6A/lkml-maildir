Can you enable CONFIG_KALLSYMS in your .config, rebuild, and then report
the decoded oops message?
Also a copy of your .config you are using that generates this would be
appreciated.
Odds are you are using a misc driver that happens to be calling
misc_register() before misc_init() gets called.  Others are reporting
this issue with the rtc driver on ppc64 boxes.
thanks,
