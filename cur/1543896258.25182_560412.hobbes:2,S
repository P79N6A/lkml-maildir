Do you make it a habit to pose ranty questions to people while neither
attributing their text nor cc'ing them?  Especially when you claim the
person's argument is "obvious nonsense", it seems quite rude.
(Since you have dismissed my argument as nonsense before hearing my
response, I will not bother answering your question.  Since you are
acting like a troll, I will dismiss you as one.  Most of this list has
already dismissed your rather unique -- I would even say frivolous --
idea of how far "mere aggregation" goes: I, for one, have better
things to do than explain why a C file is not a "mere aggregation" of
the functions it contains.)
