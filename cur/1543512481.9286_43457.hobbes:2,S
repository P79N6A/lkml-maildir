    This is encouraging.  Now I just have to figure out how they did it.
The other problem that I may have from a userspace utility it that I want to
be able to force an unmount or better to allow an unmount if no files are
currently open on the CDROM.  I don't want to be called away from
programming to find out why a CDROM from a CDROM server refuses to
eject/open a CDROM, when the usual case is that some shell or process just
happens to currently be in its mount directory or one of the decending ones.
