I do believe, however, that in these cases the header files in question are
under the LGPL, which does specifically allow linking and #including in non-GPL
and non-LGPL code.
In my opinion, this whole thing would just go away (including some of
Microsoft's anti-GPL rants), if the FSF officially declared that under the GPL,
#including a GPL header file does NOT force your code to be also GPL.
