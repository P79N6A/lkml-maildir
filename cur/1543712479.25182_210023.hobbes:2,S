It makes sense *today*. Do you want to return to this discussion
ad infinitum?
Andrea is right, block layer can be coded to detect such a (per-device)
request size increasing which does not give you any more throughput,
or increasing which hurts your latency too much, and stick with it.
More detailed:
1. size = 1 sector
2  measure throughput and latency
3. size *= 2
4. measure new_throughput and new_latency
5. if(new_throughput<=throughput*1.01 || new_latency>50ms) break
6. throughput = new_throughput; latency = new_latency; goto 3
Real code will have admin overrides (start from N sectors,
never go higher than M sectors etc), but you got the idea.
