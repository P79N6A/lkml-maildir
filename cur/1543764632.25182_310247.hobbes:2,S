Right. Today distributions can boot from external usb-storage devices,
maybe even from firewire hardware as I am sure you know. I guess they
have support for a device built-in for a reason. I think most
distributions have as streamlined kernels as possible with much code
built as modules - but they would still need some code built-in in the
kernel to have a generic kernel that supports a lot of block devices.
So I think my patch still have a value.
In my case a firewire phy is broken - and, yes - I should fix my
hardware instead of moaning about it here...
Thanks,
