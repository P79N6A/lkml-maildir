I can only speak from driving in the US.
I haven't owned a car in years because I refuse to pay for gas, but the
last time I owned one I believe my airbags and ABS system had fuses you
could pull and the car didn't subsequently disable itself. 
I'm not sure if things have changed, but that would most likely fall
under some kind of requirement of diligence to make it difficult to
defeat safety measures.
Just having to remove the thing from the dash would (probably) satisfy
the requirement.
Car enthusiasts would never stand for a law that stopped them from
modifying their stuff. It was hard enough getting us all to wear safety
belts :)
I personally like a dash board with lots of lights and stuff, especially
when driving at night. I'd suspect most others who live in dark computer
rooms with lots of blinking lights would too.
Best,
