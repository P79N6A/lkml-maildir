Because revisions in BK change if there is parallel development, it's
far more effective if you list a changeset as either
	bk changes -r1.523.1.3
i.e.,
	ChangeSet@1.523.1.3, 2002-08-27 18:29:55-07:00, fdavis@si.rr.com
	  [PATCH] drivers/media/video/bt819.c
	  Here's the bt819 i2c-old --> i2c patch.
or as the revision and the key, 
	bk prs -hr1.523.1.3 -nd':I: (:KEY:)'
i.e.,
	1.523.1.3 (fdavis@si.rr.com|ChangeSet|20020828012955|42356)
You can use the key any place you can use the revision, like so
	bk changes -r'fdavis@si.rr.com|ChangeSet|20020828012955|42356'
