Hello, I'm a new entry in this kernel mailing list.
I'm working on udp functions (those in ipv4/udp.c) and I'm focusing on
"udp_sendmsg(..)" and "udp_recvmsg". I'm trying to understand what is the
duty, what these next functions(used by udp_sendmsg and/or udp_recvmsg) really 
do:
	ip_cmsg_send
	ip_options_get
	ip_options_compile
	ip_route_output
	ip_route_output_slow
	ip_build_xmit
I presume that they are IP functions (quite silly!) but I don't know what they 
do, what functions they use and if they are necessary for my purposes.
I must get an udp packet from an input using directly udp_.. functions.
My problem now is to try to understand how the engine works.
I'm quite new to linux kernel programming.
Many thanx to every one helps me.
