Hi Vasili.

It doesn't have to. Remember, the call to schedule() normally results
in the current process sleeping and another process being run. In this
case, what the code says is "Sleep, but wake up no later than when the
specified timer alert occurs".

How about the following:
	current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTABLE;
	schedule_timeout(t);
That should do exactly the same as your excerpt...
Best wishes from Riley.
