Hi !
I've experienced Oops with 2.4.x and all the 2.4.1-ac versions of the kernel.
I've the same Oops with 2.4.2.
With 2.4.2-ac2 and ac3 (I've not not tested ac1). I've no OOps but, in the same
conditions, the system die silently ; without any message, nothing in the log
and the magic keys not working.
last time, this appended just after the message :
ax25_sendmsh(): ulistd uses obsolete socket structure
There is no problem at all with the 2.2 serie.
