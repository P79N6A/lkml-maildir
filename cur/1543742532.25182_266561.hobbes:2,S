The only indication I could find was this note in scripts/README.Menuconfig:
---------------
The windowing support utility (lxdialog) is a VERY modified version of
the dialog utility by Savio Lam <lam836@cs.cuhk.hk>.  Although lxdialog
is significantly different from dialog, I have left Savio's copyrights
intact.  Please DO NOT contact Savio with questions about lxdialog.
He will not be able to assist.
