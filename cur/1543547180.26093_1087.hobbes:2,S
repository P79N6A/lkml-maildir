I suggest we move this discussion from linux-kernel to linux-scsi.

You get timeouts from devices 3 and 4 on the bus (I assume these are
disks). These are read (0x28) and write (0x2a) commands (10 byte
versions). Note that these timeouts start at 00:42:50.
The disks probably time out because the tape drive has not released the
SCSI bus.

This is presumably the last command sent to the tape drive. It is a write
command that writes 64 tape blocks in fixed block mode. This looks legal.
The time here is 00:57:20 which means that the tape command times out 15
minutes after the first timeout from the disks. The tape driver timeout is
15 minutes and so the tape command times out properly.
After this the SCSI subsystem decides that it should try to reset the SCSI
bus to resolve the problem.

(I am not trying to shout: the capital letters are cut from the SCSI
standard draft :-)
(If you enable verbose SCSI messages in the kernel configuration, the
kernel does this translation for you.)

translation: LOGICAL UNIT IS IN PROCESS OF BECOMING READY
When the tape driver sees a unit attention anywhere else than at open(),
it prevents further access to the tape until some command is issued that
puts the tape into a known position. Rewind is one example. So, the fact
that you don't seem to be able to do anything with the tape after the bus
reset may not a bug. (MTOFFL should be allowed but there may be something
I overlook.)
The real problem is why the tape drive does not release the SCSI bus when
it has been sent a command that from the log output looks legal. Usually
the tape drives and SCSI adapters are configured so that if any command
takes a long time, the SCSI bus is released when the data has been
transferred. I assume that SCSI disconnects are enabled in your
configuration?
The most common reasons for a SCSI device hanging are:
- problems with the SCSI cables and/or termination
  - your drive works with earlier kernels; it is possible (maybe not
    probable) that the new kernel shows problems if the cables/termination
    are marginal
- the power supply is not large enough
It is also possible that some change in the kernel has created a bug. The
changes in the tape driver after 2.2 have been such that they should not
affect normal writing (barring side effects from the changes). Besides
changes in the tape driver, there have been changes in the middle level
SCSI code and the aic7xx host driver. Other changes in the kernel have
also changed the environment where these drivers work.
I am sorry that I can't provide any direct solution for your problem at
this time. Above I have only deciphered from the logs what has happened,
not why. This needs more thinking...
