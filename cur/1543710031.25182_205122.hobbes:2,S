In 2.6, we already have sufficient changes for Intel IPF Compiler to
build the kernel, especially intrinscs changes, and you should not need
a patch. To make it faster, we might want to use PGO (profile guided
optimization) provided by the compiler; yes, it's available even for the
kernel with a driver.
Thanks,
Jun
