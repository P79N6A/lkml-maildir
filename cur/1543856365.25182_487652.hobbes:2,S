What's the cruft ? 
struct bla = container_of(timer, struct bla, timer); ???

Err, you remove the timer->data = (unsigned long) hackery. Why is this
adding cruft ?
I looked deeper into it. We have following timer usage:
- timers which don't use data at all - no change except for the callback
argument of the function.
- timers which point to the data structure which embedds them - only the
callback has to get a container_of()
- static single instance timers, which use .data as local storage for
some value. That can be done with a simple static variable near the
timer and using that variable instead of .data
- some rather seldom multi instance timers, which need then to become a
data structure.

It will. Just some random files:
