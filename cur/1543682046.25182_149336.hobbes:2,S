Hi,
Here are some USB fixes for 2.6.0-test1.  There are a lot of good race
condition fixes from Oliver Neukum, and some usb-storage fixes for some
devices.  I've also included the change that flushes all in-flight urbs
_before_ disconnect() is called to fix some problems in the visor and
ftdi_sio drivers.  This also lets drivers become a lot simpler as they
don't have to manage their list of urbs now.  And some usb gadget fixes
are also present.
I've also fixed a nasty bug in the usb-serial core that has been there
for about 4 years now.  Thanks to the good debugging options in the
kernel now, it was pretty easy to find.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/linus-2.5
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
