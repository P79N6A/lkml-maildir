Hi all,
Apologies for not getting this message out sooner.  I had a busy
day yesterday and I wanted to make sure to test a range of 
configurations so I could send a pretty complete snapshot of
what going on with my laptop with a set of important config options
tweaked.
First, an observation:  USB appears to have no bearing on the keyboard
lockup problem on my machine.  The problem does appear to at least be 
an interaction issue with the Yenta driver.  In none of these test cases
is USB enabled.
Here are are two configurations where 2.3.41 locks up my keyboard and
mouse.
Notes:  I have USB disabled and Yenta enabled in this first example.
For each test, I am including the .config file and /var/log/messages
output.

COMMENTS:  This first example shows something that I don't 
understand and that seems odd.  Specifically, the following extraction 
from the messages log above shows that the Card Manager starts loading
pcmcia device modules before the Yenta driver finds and enables
the Cardbus code.  At least, that's what appears to be happening.

-------------------------------------------------------------
TEST #2
In this test, the only configuration change from TEST #1
is that I set CONFIG_I82365=y.  The keyboard locked up with 
this configuration as well.
As far as I can tell from the messages output, the i82365 driver is
never loaded and the messages output is identical to that for the
previous test.
-------------------------------------------------------------
The rest of my tests all yielded a working keyboard and mouse,
but PCMCIA was always broken.  I have failed to find a way to
get working PCMCIA services for 2.3.41.
I tried the following combinations:
	PCMCIA in kernel
	No Yenta driver
	I82365 enabled
	PCMCIA as module
	No Yenta driver
	I82365 enabled
	PCMCIA as module
	Yenta driver enabled
	I82365 enabled
Here's the messages output for this last combination:
