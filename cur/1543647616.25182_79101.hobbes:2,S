I think, upon reading this entire conversation so far, that the
functionality is just about useless (ie, any programs that have taken
advantage of sys_call_table have been patched to not necessarily do so)
.. but if it were necessary, there could quite probably relatively
easily be a "addto_syscall_table" function or some such.  hmm.
