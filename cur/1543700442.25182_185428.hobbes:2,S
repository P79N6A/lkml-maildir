I implemented the algorithm, and before submitting it, I asked
the authors of the paper I used to implement the algorithm what
the patent status of this algorithm is.  The paper doesn't say
anything about any patents (in retrospect, obviously it wouldn't.)

There is one already, and it's suboptimal, to say it mildly.

I asked this question on l-k because there seem to be many 'common'
techniques in wide use which have US patents covering them.
Considering the circumstances, yes, licensing is probably out of the
question.

I wouldn't be surprised if publishing source code implementing a patented
algorithm would itself be considered as a patent violation (I'm not saying
that it would make sense to me though.)
I think this l-k thread was sufficiently instructive for me to decide that
I won't be publishing my implementation of this algorithm, and I'll just
wait until another (free) LPM algorithm pops up.
