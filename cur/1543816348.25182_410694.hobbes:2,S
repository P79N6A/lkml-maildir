Well it's not good.  Will ecryptfs-0.1 files be both-way compatible with
ecryptfs-0.2 files?
The basic unit of a pagecache page's backing store should be a
filesystem-determined blocksize, divorced from page sizes.
For your purposes we can abstract things out a bit and not have to worry
about the actual on-underlying-disk blocksize.  Which is fortunate, because
you want an ecryptfs-on-ext3-on-1kblocksize file to work when copied to an
ecryptfs-on-ext2-on-2kblocksize filesystem.
I think it would be acceptable to design ecryptfs to assume that its
underlying store has a 4096-byte "blocksize".  So all the crypto operates
on 4096-byte hunks and the header is 4096-bytes long and things are copied
to and from the underlying fs's pagecache in 4096-byte hunks.
That's because 4096 is, for practical purposes, the minimum Linux
PAGE_CACHE_SIZE.  Globally available and all filesystems support it.

That seems a reasonable way of doing it.  It's all logically one patch, but
for review purposes we need some sort of splitup.

OK.  But I'm sure Miklos would appreciate help with that ;)

Maybe.  One could estimate the cost of that by benchmarking an existing
(efficient) FUSE fs and then add fiddle factors.  If the number of copies
is the same for in-kernel versus FUSE then one would expect the performance
to be similar.  Especially if the encrypt/decryption cost perponderates.
