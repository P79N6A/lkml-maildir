Yes, I do recall it says "System is 724k".  zImage failes.  bzImage says
724k as well and succeeds.

That was the idea in this.  Once I get my stuff the way I want it, I'll
probably move on to using initramfs.  My initrd is using ramdisk, my / is on
tmpfs and is populated by .tgz files on other media (The boot time is
generally short lived by design anyway)
