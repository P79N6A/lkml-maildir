I think we have to either:
1) Link only to the file and not the directory in the file-directory 
duality. This means we change the semantics of hard link so that it only 
links to the data and the standard metadata, and the optional 
attributes/streams/files-in-directory are not seen by the second link. 
You can think of this as meaning that hard links only connect to the 
file and not the directory in the file-directory wave-particle duality
or, 2) we should ask Alexander Smith to help with applying the graph 
traversal cycle detection code that he wrote.
I can go either way contentedly for now. 2) is the right long term 
solution. 1) is probably the right short term solution.
Ok, Linus and Viro, now I see why it was hard. Being able to effectively 
connect to compound documents only with symlinks is a bit distasteful, 
but it is quite livable, and I very much hope you decide it is better 
than fragmenting the namespace.
