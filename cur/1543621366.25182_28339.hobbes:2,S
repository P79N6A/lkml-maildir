That's not the problem, I meant this sentence: "This led to Linus
requesting that everything that entry.S needs to access be separated out
into another structure." Splitting the task structure and the stack page
is fine. Keeping the most important fields in the stack page is fine too,
if the architecture requires it. But the decision what goes into
thread_info, should not be made only to avoid access to task_struct from
entry.S.
bye, Roman
