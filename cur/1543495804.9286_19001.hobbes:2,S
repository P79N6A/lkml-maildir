   Folks,
   I sent this mail out on Wednesday and no one answered. (3)  There's been
a bunch of stuff going on, what with 2.3.0 and 2.2.[89] released so
recently... I figure my question just got lost in the noise.  So here goes
again:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Can someone give an official word regarding kernel process checkpointing
support?  "Eduardo Pinheiro" <edpin@cos.ufrj.br> has a checkpoint patch,
EPCKPT(1), available against 2.2.1 and 2.0.36 with which "Werner G. Krebs"
<werner.krebs@yale.edu> is using for checkpoint and process migration
support in the development version of GNU/QUEUE(2).  This feature is of
interest to my employer and we're wondering if it, or something like it,
will wind up supported in the kernel proper. (4)
Thanks!
J. Maynard Gelinas

(4) Personally, I think it would be a cool feature -- but that's JMHO.
