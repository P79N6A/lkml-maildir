Hi Vojtech,
I'm running 2.5.26 with an ordinary PS/2 keyboard and a 5 button PS/2 mouse.
When using the old psaux driver the mouse works fine.
With input core support, however, the scroll wheel doesn't work properly.
In my XF86Config I'm using IMPS/2 protocol and ZAxisMapping 4 5.
Scrolling up causes the window to scroll down. Scrolling down doesn't do
anything. When changing the protocol to ExplorerPS2 things are not much
better. You can't drag windows over the screen.
The following is the relevant kernel information.
Do you have any tips?
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice

input.c: hotplug returned -2

Regards,
Udo.
