Actually it means "not tight" or unconstrained as in "loosen
the collar and check airflow before performing
mouth-to-mouth" or "let loose the dogs"
In actual usage loose and lose can be antonyms when
referring to priveleges.  "loose privs" vs "lose privs".
I found at least one case of correction that looked wrong so
i perused the lot, see comments.

This might have been "loosely notify" but careful examination of the
context idicates it should be "lose notification process" or
"lose the notify process".

Good catch.  We don't want "New thread loosens kernel privileges."
