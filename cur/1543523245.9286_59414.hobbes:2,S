Yes it is. New gcc's (try to) keep the stack aligned at 16 bytes. The
kernel stack is 8Kb on ia32; the 16byte alignment is mostly for floating
point performance on Pentium and up, and floating point is forbidden in the
kernel anyway. So this is a sizeable savings for negligible performance
impact.
My question in this vein would be the -fno-strength-reduce. The gcc bug
that placed this in the kernel was in gcc-2.7.2, and was worked around in
2.7.2.3 by just making this option unconditional. Both 2.2.15pre4 and
2.3.41pre2 at least demand gcc-2.7.2.3 as minimal version.
