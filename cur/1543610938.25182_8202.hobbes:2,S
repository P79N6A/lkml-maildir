I have not yet seen the patch, but one nice feature that a system call 
interface
could provide is the ability to *atomically* change the cpu affinities of 
sets of
processes -- for example, all processes with a certain uid or gid.  All that
would be required would be for the system call to accept a command integer
value which would define what the argument integer value would mean -- a pid,
a gid, or a uid.
