ah but you get an oops! That has nothing to do with the bug triggered by
the google workload.  I thought "the system locked" above meant it was a
live lock like it was happening before fixing the kernel bug that was
generating the live lock with the google workload. I couldn't imagine
"the system locked" meant "I got an oops", sorry.
So let's check the Oops:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000200
 printing eip:
00000200
*pde = 00000000

this sounds like faulty hardware. Are you sure your ram is not buggy?
I will start now an infinite loop of the google workload. How many runs
it takes exactly before you can reproduce btw?
Before fixing the bug I could reproduce the live lock just during the
first run. So to verify the problem was fixed I run 3/4 runs of the
workload but never more than this (mainly because of the pause() that
forced me to C^c without automating the loop, I will now drop the
pause() and start an infinite loop).
