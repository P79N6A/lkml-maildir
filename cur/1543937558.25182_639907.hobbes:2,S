Thanks but unfortunately it still seams not to be working.  I cannot 
sucessfully:
 git-clone 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/x86/linux-2.6-x86.git
I can see the git repository over http but I am guessing something did not go 
right with 'git --bare update-server-info' as the .git/info directory does 
not have the refs like Linus' does which are needed for http (gleaming this 
from man git-update-server-info).  There have been updates to the git tree 
since you responded so it looks like that hook did not get activated.  (these 
are guesses from me and I don't really know git well so don't trust a word I 
say)
thanks
