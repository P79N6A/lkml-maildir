I merged it, but for non-critical fixes I'll tend to sit on them for a week
or so before sending them in to Linus.
This patch has now turned up in git-sched which is a considerable
inconvenience.
Ingo, please don't just merge everything which crosses your desk.  I'm now
in the position that I either drop the patch and completely lose track of
it or I need to apply then revert it to make your tree apply.
Hopefully Linus will apply the patch from Hugh's email, but that isn't the
general solution to this increasingly worse problem.
