Hi Eric,
This .text.head section is not part of vmlinux. This is part of uncompressed
portion in bzImage. arch/i386/boot/compressed/head.S.
Hence, arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.lds should take care of it which
already has entry for linking .text.head section.
        . =  0  ;
        .text.head : {
                _head = . ;
                *(.text.head)
                _ehead = . ;
        }
Thanks
Vivek
