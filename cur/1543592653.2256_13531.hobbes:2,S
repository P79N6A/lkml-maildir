Hello!
I am having problems with loading modules:
I always get the unresolved symbols message.
I didn't find any documentation for that, can you help me ?
What I did:
compiled 2.4.4; installed modules.
depmod -ae -F /usr/src/linux/System.map 2.4.4 runs fine,
depmod -a doesn't run fine (unresolved symbols)
modprobe any_module results in unresolved modules message.
modutils are 2.4.2.
Any ideas what I did wrong ?
Sincerly,
Nico
