Not completely. When page is unmapped from the *very last*
user its *first* toucher may already be dead. So we'll never
find out who it was.

No. The question is "how to get a container that touched the
page first" which is the same as "how to find mm_struct which
touched the page first". Obviously there's no answer on this
question unless we hold some direct page->container reference.
This may be a hash, a direct on-page pointer, or mirrored
array of pointers.

This could work for reclamation: we scan through all the
mm_struct-s within the container and shrink its' pages, but
we can't make LRU this way.
