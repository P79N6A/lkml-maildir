Here Athlon XP 1700+, XFree86 4.3.0.1, IceWM 1.2.9. Clocks with
seconds on both window manager and screen, but it happens
without them and if I just startx and close it. As I reported
it doesn't happen with your patch, but I may be seeing the
other "problem" you mentioned at
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=3Dlinux-kernel&m=3D105908939813118&w=3D2
"BTW, with my patch accented characters works correctly only on
VT1.  I'm not sure how it behaves on Linus tree..."
Same behavior without your patch. Here I use setfont
lat1-16.psfu in my init scripts. All accents work on the first
console but on the others most miss them for capitals.
