   Hi! I have installed linux kernel 2.2.5 ac4 in a nfs server for sgi and
ibm workstations. I use knfs (version 1.2.2) and it works ok. But
yesterday i put all home directories from the users in the nfs server, to
discover that i constantly get messages about permission failure on
/var/adm/messages. I get hundreds of those, and they happen mainly when
users run pine and access their folders in the home directory, or use
netscape (while accessing the history file, for instance). The messages go
like this: 
Apr 15 20:06:41 jerry kernel: fh_verify: .netscape/history.dat permission
failure, acc=4, error=13 
Apr 15 20:07:14 jerry last message repeated 9 times 
Apr 15 20:08:18 jerry last message repeated 17 times
... ad nauseum
   The funny thing is that everything works ok, at least it seems. I never
had those messages with user space nfs and kernel 2.0.36, but had to
upgrade because of file locking. I checked /linux/fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c and
found this NFSD_PARANOIA define. I know i can get rid of it, but should i?
Shouldnt i be worried? 
   Also i read that i should increase the number of times nfsd loads to 8
(NFSDCOUNT) on startup. I read the man pages, but they didnt seem clear on
it. Why should i do that? Isnt it bad? Because i did it and some Aix
workstations (4.3) complained about permission problems accessing the
server.
   One more question, do the ac patches include the patches from the knfsd
maintainer, included in the knfsd package? Because some appear already to
be on the tree, but others dont even apply.
Best regards,
TA
