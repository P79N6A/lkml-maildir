Both are proper - if the command given is "pwd" and a pwd command happens
to be implemented in the shell (bash/csh). The shell "pwd" outputs tracks of
the "cd" command and just displays what is seen in this track. Each cd
command replaces/appends to the list depending on how the parameter specifies
the path. This was done to optimize a frequently used (in shell scripts
anyway) command to eliminate the multiple directory open/close cycles needed
to implement a generic "pwd" utility. BTW, when the shell version is used,
there is no file access checks made
The program /bin/pwd gives the expected answer by reading the current directory
to find .., then reading it to locate the inode reference to the current
unnamed directory (well, known as . -> alias is looked up in .. by searching
for the inode number). This cycle repeats until /bin/pwd reaches the root
directory.
Both are avilable in Slackware and Red Hat. The behaviour is correct.
