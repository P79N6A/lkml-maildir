The systems that are built because there is no machine that can
run your compute intensive application fast enough they matter quite
a bit.

Good answers have already been given.
The problem domain I am looking at are compute clusters.  The
solutions are useful elsewhere but in compute clusters they are
extremely valuable.

I agree, glibc would be fine, but it must be below the level of
the application.   Generally it is a pretty onerous task to checkpoint 
a random program.  For a proof attempt to checkpoint your X desktop,
the infrastructure is there to do it.  
Every application must be capable of checkpointing it for the cluster
batch scheduler to take advantage of it.
Example case.
[Preemption]
You start job 1, a compute intensive application that runs for 4 days,
on 100 cpus.  Your job is low priority.
In comes job2, a high priority job that runs for 4 hours and needs 256
cpus.
job1 is preempted.  With checkpoint support it can be saved and
restarted later.  Without checkpointing support it is simply killed.
[Migration]
Migration is needed for failing hardware or to get low priority jobs
out of the way onto less capable nodes that are going unused.
Or to restart a job that failed on other hardware.
