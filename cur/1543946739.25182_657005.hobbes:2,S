Subject: [PATCH 3/6] regulator: platform level interface.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/20/367

This interface configures a regulator for use within a specific device. It
allows for the creation of voltage and current domains (with constraints) for
each regulator. Regulator constraints help prevent device damage by providing
protection for over voltage or over current events caused by buggy client
drivers.
This interface also allows the creation of a regulator tree whereby some
regulators are supplied by others (similar to a clock tree). This means a
parent regulator will be enabled before it's children are enabled and
disabled after it's children have all been disabled.
