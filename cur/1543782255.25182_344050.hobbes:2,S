Where did you get the ntp_adj from? It's not in my example.
gettimeofday() was in the previous mail: "xtime + (cycle_offset * mult +
error) >> shift". The difference between system time and reference 
time is really important. gettimeofday() returns the system time, NTP 
controls the reference time and these two are synchronized regularly.
I didn't see that anywhere in your example.
bye, Roman
