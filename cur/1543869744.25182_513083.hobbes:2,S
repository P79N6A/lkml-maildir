I have envisioned that this tag could be added by Kconfig automatically for
all symbols that are dependent on EXPERIMENTAL.
To do so the new option syntax could be extended.
So we had something like:
config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Bla bla"
	option adddisplay=(EXPERIMENTAL)
This would cause all symbols selected by EXPERIMENTAL to have
the string "(EXPERIMENTAL)" added to the prompt when displayed.
Same could be used for DEPRECATED and OBSOLETE.
I have not looked into the feasability to implement this - other
Kconfig items needs to be fixed first.
