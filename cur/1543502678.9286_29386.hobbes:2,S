hi,
since a few day we've got the following:
--------------------------
[lfarkas@firewall:/home/lfarkas]ping www.intel.com
PING www.intel.com (192.102.198.160) from 194.152.134.8 : 56 data bytes

--------------------------------------
the problem allways at 8th byte, the difference is allways 1 and it's 
increase by 1 in the packages. it's an SMC EPIC/100 ethernet card. 
it's a hardware problem or can be some software problem ?
we've replaced the card with a ne2k_pci and a 3com 3c509 but both generate 
the same error. it's a RH 6.0 with all update on a pentium mmx, with 
kernel 2.2.5-22. ipforwarding, masquarading, ipchains are used on it.
if we ping a nearish host we don't got the above error, although
on the same hub another linux server (almost the same) never produce
the error.
thanks.
