Bah. I have a Majordomo list with ~12000 subscribers. No problems. Not to
mention a hundred other lists of various sizes. Majordomo's resend load is
proportional to number of messages, not subscribers. Oh yeah, I've been
using Zmailer for the past couple years because sendmail stopped being
able to keep up with the queue long ago.. 
Of course, I have much faster disks in my mail server than vger - I've got
a couple UW SCSI drives with a Buslogic controller. Load sits at < 1
typically.
