This is great stuff. I'll definitely try it out in an hour or two. I'd
be interested in helping with the cleanup of the things assuming the BH
things still exist but might need a wee bit of hand-holding to get
through it. I'll go around flagging people down who might be able to
help me with it as I go.
I actually suspect tty-related things are a likely culprit as
significant use of the serial console occurs.

I can at least try it out. The BH stuff is legacy, so killing it
entirely at some point makes sense. I did volunteer to help with
this at OLS, so I'll be delivering code at some point.
Cheers,
