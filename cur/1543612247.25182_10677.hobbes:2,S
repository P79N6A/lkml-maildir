In __i810_update_lvi(), try changing the line that reads:
x = (dmabuf->dmasize + dmabuf->swptr - 1) % dmabuf->dmasize;
to use - 2 instead of -1 and see if that solves the problem (I've been 
suspecting an off-by-one error, I just haven't found it for sure.  The 
whole 65536 vs. 0 could be providing the off-by-one though.)
