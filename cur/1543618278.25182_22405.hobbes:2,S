Yep, that was the first thing that crossed my mind.  
I had a floppy with memtest86 installed on it, and it ran for 4 hours
without any errors.  Since I've seen memtest86 find bad bits on memory
modules
that normally worked for me, I figured that this must surely indicate 
that my segfaults are not related to bad memory subsystem.
Also, while I expect setting the command line option
mem=nopentium
would slow things down slightly, I don't think that they'd be so slow
as to hide the bad memory.  Also, the segfaults happen VERY reliably
without the mem=nopentium option, and have not happened even once, 
WITH the mem=nopentium option.
One more curious thing is, I've got 64MB GForce-2 MX, and the largest
I can set my AGP aparature size to is 64MB.  Maybe a boundary
condition thing???
