I suspect the system is falling back to the PIT instead of the ACPI PM
due to mis-merged patch in 2.6.17-rc3-mm1. The PIT has had a few reports
of problems, and I've got a test patch which I'm waiting for some
results on from a tester before sending (I can't reproduce the issue
locally).
Applying the patch here should get the ACPI PM working again.
