There is no `birthday paradox' in this case.   There would be a birthday
paradox if the question was what is the chance of having two random numbers
that are the same after picking _n_ random numbers.  In this case instead
of have a n/2**32 chance of a collision there would be an
(n(n-1)/2)/2**32 chance of a collision.  But in this case we have
a single random number, and we want to know if it is the same as a
single previous random number, so the odds of a collision are 1/2**32.
