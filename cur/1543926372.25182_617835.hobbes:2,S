The integrity of the table.  Entries can be added and removed
(both operations being *RARE* which is good!) at any time.

No, there's more than that.  This is what runs under it in
the hot paths, yes, but the gpio request/free paths do
more work than this.  (That includes direction setting,
since that can be an implicit request.)

The get/set bit calls are the hot paths.  Locking on those paths
buys us a consistent locking policy, which is obviously correct.
It's consistent with the request/free paths.
But I think what you're suggesting is that the "requested" flag
is effectively a long-term lock, so grabbing the spinlock on
those paths is not necessary.  Right?
Hmm ... that makes some sense.  I hadn't started out thinking of
that "requested" flag as a lock bit, but in fact that's what it
ended up becoming.
Removing the spinlock from those paths -- at least in the "no
extra checks case" -- would let us avoid all this flamage about
whether raw spinlocks are ever OK.
I think I forsee a patch coming...
