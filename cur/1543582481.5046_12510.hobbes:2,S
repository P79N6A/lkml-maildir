Short answer: the existence of 'rename' makes it necessary, since it
means that the directory path is volatile as far as the client is
concerned.
IIRC several NFS implementations (not Linux though) rely on being able
to walk back up the directory tree in order to discover the path at
any given moment.
Under Linux, our reliance on dentries doesn't allow for directory
paths to be volatile, so we don't support it. Instead we end up having
to support aliased directories.
Cheers,
