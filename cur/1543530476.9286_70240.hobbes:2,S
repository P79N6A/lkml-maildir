Subject: Random memory corruptions in 2.3.51 / 2.3.99pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I get random memory corruptions when the system is loaded (e.g. a big
compile and some ISDN traffic). I checked various oopses/panics and
they all pointed to something randomly overwriting memory. One crashed
because the timer list was corrupted, another in kmalloc, another in 
the vfsmounts list (with next overwriten with 0x40159554). There were
some more hangs, but I didn't catch all because some occurred in X11. 
No SMP or highmem.  egcs 1.1. K6-400 with running CPU fan. 
I know the report is not very helpful, but maybe it'll help as a 
datapoint. I use the ALI 1541 IDE driver so maybe it is a IDE 
driver issue.
