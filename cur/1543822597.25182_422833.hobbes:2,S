I think I agree - e.g. i would expect the virtual interrupts to have
enough jitter too. Maybe it would be good if someone could
run a few statistics on the resulting numbers?
Ok the randomness added doesn't consist only of the least significant
bits. Currently it adds jiffies+full 32bit cycle count.  I guess if it was
a real problem the code could be changed to leave out the jiffies and 
only add maybe a 8 bit word from the low bits. But that would only
help for the para case because the algorithm for native guests
cannot be changed.

I claim (without having read any code) that in theory you need to have solved 
that problem already in the vTPM @)
