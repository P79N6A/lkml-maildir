Ok, agreed. I think this will work but taking the lru lock each time
is probably not a good idea.

This sounds like something that is worth trying. I missed that one.
Side note: The BUG in __pagevec_lru_del seems strange. refill_inactive
or shrink_cache could have removed the page from the lru before
__pagevec_lru_del acquired the lru lock.
