Not the environment of somebody else's process, though. But that is
currently possible in mainline, the problem is not with ps but with
the kernel.

Basically, if anyone reads /proc/pid/cmdline early enough, when
mm->arg_end is still 0, the kernel will blast out the process environment
through that interface. Thus, you get the data of /proc/pid/environ
without the access restrictions of that file. Not good if you happen
to pass sensitive information using environment variables.
Check out the patch I posted earlier in this thread.
