No.  ext3 scalability is very poor, I'm afraid.  The fs really wasn't
up and running until kernel 2.4.5 and we just didn't have time to
address that issue.

The vague plan there is to replace lock_kernel with lock_journal
where appropriate.  But ext3 scalability work of this nature
will be targetted at the 2.5 kernel, most probably.
I'll take a look, see if there's any low-hanging fruit in there,
but I doubt that the results will be fantastic.
