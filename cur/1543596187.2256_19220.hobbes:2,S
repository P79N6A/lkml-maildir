Yes, agreed.
I mean, it's almost ready for port maintainers to migrate new
interface (only two issues remain:
include/linux/highmem.h:memclear_highpage_flush and ptrace), as soon
as 2.5.x starts. 
For the time being, I let SH-4 port have null definitions of
flush_page_to_ram and flush_icache_page, and see how things are going.
