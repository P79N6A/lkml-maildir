These beasts are still alive and kicking. I boot a handful of
arm and ppc boards on a frequent basis that are zImage
only.  The kicker is I don't have the bootloader source for
most of them, so changing to a different image format is
tough at best.
Not a vote one way or the other, just some observations
from my day to day.
