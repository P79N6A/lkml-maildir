Hello,
The *BSD have a feature called "softupdates" which seems to be the
following: writes to a ufs filesystem are not synced on a sector basis
but according to the filesystem structure, which means that between two
physical updates, the filesystem is always coherent.
I made some benchs and it seems rather fast (about 5 to 10% slower than
the async mount, which is what Linux does).
Here is my problem: we have here several Linux PC in hostile environment
(students) and they are often uncleanly rebooted. The Sun Solaris
stations nearly always recover automatically, but the Linux stations
often require a manual root intervention. This upsets our sysadmin.
So.. is there any plan/patch for integrating some softupdate feature to
ext2 under Linux ? Or is there something I utterly missed ?
