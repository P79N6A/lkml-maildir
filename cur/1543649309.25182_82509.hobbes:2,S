So it looks like you don't have a driver for the mouse loaded (should be hid). 
Can you check this in driverfs? (You used to be able to do this in 
/proc/bus/usb/drivers,  but the maintainer knew better :-{)
If you did this as modules, lsmod would be good to know too.
Also, there is a problem with 2.5.43, in that the core driver model stuff got 
screwed up. That caused problem if you turned on the usb test framework 
driver, and some other issues. Here is a simple patch that David Brownell 
did:

I'm not sure about 2.5.44 - you could try that too?
