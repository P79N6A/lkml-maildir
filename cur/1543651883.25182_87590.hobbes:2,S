Why not keep the source compressed in memory. Since the primary purpose
of this feature, would be debugging/learning, the extra memory usage
will not be a problem on a 128 or 256 megs ram system. We can also come
up with schemes to store only part of the source to allow source
debugging of some parts of the kernel only.. but I wonder how much space
the extra debug info would take up?
