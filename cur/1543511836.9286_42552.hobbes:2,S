Yes, pretty much.  Apart from things like /sbin/init, the kernel doesn't have
any pathnames hard-coded into it.
I can think of two reasonable approaches:
1. build the microcode into the driver itself.  Since its pretty small, this
shouldn't be a big deal, and its what other drivers do.  You could even make it
a separate module which is loaded when necessary, and can be regenerated from a
new microcode release by a script without having to recompile the whole driver.
2. If the microcode is going to chnage often, you could add an ioctl for
inserting the microcode, which an accompanying user-mode program to read it
from disk and pass it to the ioctl.

See Documentation/devices.txt

Should be OK, but what are the real requirements?  Do you need to sleep for at
least 50us, or exactly 50us?
Hope this helps,
