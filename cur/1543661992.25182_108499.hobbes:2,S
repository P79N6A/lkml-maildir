It's pretty easy to do in 2.5 :-). A 2.4 backport is of course feasible,
but requires a bit more work (and possibly abstracting some of the
elevator stuff there).

It probably is too small, testing will show. I don't see too many
collisions from a dbench 32 or 64, so...

The rate of unrelated merging is typically quite low, so no it probably
doesn't provide much of a performance benefit. However, it also keeps
the code simpler to simply have a single merge hash per queue.

I don't know yet, haven't booted it on my work station yet. Will do so
soon :)
