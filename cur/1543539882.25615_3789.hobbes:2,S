Actually I must have had a senior moment.  What I ment was:
          (int)((struct thing *)0)->stuff
which is an integer.  Of course the real problem is not being in a
function and the limits that imposes.

Understood.  I think you get about 4 instructions more or less.  In my
case the dummy wrapper is never called either, as a label is used to
enter and exit.  (I know the manual says one should not fool the C
compiler in this way, but, hay, it works.
