OK, I misunderstood you. It seemed to me that you were proposing that
*all* CD-ROM entries would appear in a single directory (no
sub-directories). That would be tricky. But the scheme you outline
would be pretty easy. You don't even need to modify devfs to support
this. All you need to do is set up some symlinks (from user space).
