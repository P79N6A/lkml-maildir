And, one other item that was minor till I had a stable system, and 
thats the apparently non-destruction of open paths when doing a 
reboot.  If *any* x based shells are open with a path to someplace,  
and I type a "rebootENTER" in one of them, then at umount time the 
kernel goes into its 3 tries and out routine, saying that partition 
so-and-so is busy.
But, I'm running on it, so like the Harley rider, it can't be all 
bad. :-)
