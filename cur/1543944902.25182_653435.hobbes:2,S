Five months is too long to fix a bug when someone has already sent us a
patch.  If they insist on being this sluggish I'd suggest that you review
the patch yourself then just merge it.  That will get their attention. 
Maybe.

Two months, same story.

In current mainline, __devinit qpti_sbus_probe() still is calling __init
qpti_chain_add() (for example).  So in a CONFIG_HOTPLUG kernel, hotplugging
a new device (on sbus, ok, bad example ;)) will crash.
But Adrian has fixed six such bugs in there, maybe one of them can hit.  I
don't think we've fixed these by alternative means, unless we've disabled
__devinit?
Still, we can discuss specific patches all day.  I think there is a
_general_ problem getting bugfixes, warning fixes and cleanups into scsi
drivers within reasonable amounts of time?
