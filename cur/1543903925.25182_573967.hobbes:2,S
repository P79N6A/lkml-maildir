Indeed, no code changes, and I feel strongly that it should go into
2.6.23 because it's *fun*.   And (as often complained) there's not
enough poetry in the kernel.

It does add an lguest-specific script: I aimed for the minimal
documentation script required to weave the code and documentation
(basically extracts and orders by comment prefix, because code order
isn't the same as optimal documentation order).
This is great for lguest, where the entire codebase is small and
self-contained enough to be woven into a narrative, and the maintainer
is prepared to put in the cycles to keep it uptodate.
But writing this documentation took *weeks*, to document 5000 lines of
code.  Perhaps this effort, if merged, will inspire others, but I've
seen little indication so far: we have enough trouble getting them
documenting a single public function.

So they can see what we're talking about, here's an example of the
output:
