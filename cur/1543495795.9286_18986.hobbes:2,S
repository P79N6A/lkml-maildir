Subject: 2.3.1 hard lockup after sound being initalized

I made the plunge today and wanted to test (for shits and giggles
mainly) 2.3.1, after I booted it I had no sound (I use GNOME with sound
enabled). So I fired up GQmpeg to test sound, and then blame hard lock.
No responce to ping, control-SysRq, nothing. It took a hard reset to get
the system back online. Not suprisingly it left nothing in the log files
so I really have nothing to go back and check. I can reproduce the
lock-up again though if needed.
Here's a copy of the .config, if more is needed let me know.
Thanks,
David Morgan.
