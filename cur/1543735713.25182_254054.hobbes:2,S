Dmitry,
   I imagined the sanitized interfaces would be provided via a userspace
library, similar to how lspci provides a clean interface to all of the
PCI data.  An "lsacpi" tool could extract the information into something
more like you suggest.  If you have objects exposed as human
readable/writable files, I think you'll quickly end up with a _STA
driver, _HID driver, _CID driver, _ADR driver, _UID driver, _EJx driver,
etc, etc, etc...  I don't think we want that kind of bloat in the kernel
(that's what userspace is for ;^).  Providing a solid, direct interface
to ACPI methods in the kernel seems like the most flexible, powerful
interface IMHO.  Thanks,
	Alex
