Thanks for doing this, Nick.  One area looks like some details
need working.

I don't think /proc/<pid>/cpuset (PROC_PID_CPUSET) is, or should be,
deprecated.
Actually, I'd be inclined toward removing this CONFIG option, and
making /proc/<pid>/cpuset a non-optional consequence of enabling
cpusets ... so I'm adding Paul Menage to the CC list, in case he has
thoughts or insights on this.  The duplication of this bit of information
between both /proc/<pid>/cpuset and one line of /proc/<pid>/status is a
minor and harmless wart, resulting from the evolution of cgroups from
cpusets, that is not worth bothering kernel configuration users with
questions about.
And isn't that a line in /proc/<pid>/cgroup, not in /proc/<pid>/status ?
