Well, to start with, any use of kdev_t for block devices is a flaw
(fortunately most of fs/*/*.c ones are gone by now and buffer cache
will follow).
As for the init_special_inode() I'd rather have le16_to_dev() et.al.
so that ext2_read_inode() and friends would do
	init_special_inode(inode, mode, le16_to_dev(raw->i_rdev));
Reasons:
	a) foo_mknod() - why the hell would we take dev_t, pass it into
->mknod() only to split it into major:minor there and immediately
rebuild dev_t from them?  And that - for _all_ instances of ->mknod()
	b) what happens in ->read_inode() is "here's on-disk encoding,
we want to know which dev_t value it is".  Sure, helpers that do
mapping will need to know encoding.  ->read_inode() itself, though...
Why do we care about major:minor split at that level?
