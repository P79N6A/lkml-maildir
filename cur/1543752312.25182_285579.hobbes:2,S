uselib() is only one of the zillion places in the Linux kernel where 
security vulnerabilities can occur. OK, now one was found there, but
is this enough for changing the status quo if the zillion other places
with possible vulnerabilities are still present and will stay?
If a vendor chooses to diverge from the ftp.kernel.org kernel in this
point, I don't see why this should cause any "evil" problems.

A patch for one config option for all pre-libc6 system calls might be 
interesting if it allows to disable a serious amount of system calls and 
is well-tested to not break any libc6, libc5 or libc4 binaries.
