Why is that different from:
 	int my_module_init(void)
 	{
 		int ret;
 		ret = reserve_foo();
 		if (ret != 0)
 			return ret;
 		ret = reserve_bar();
 		if (ret != 0) {
 			unreserve_foo();
	 		return ret;
		}
 		use_foo();
 		use_bar();
		return 0;
 	}

And in my example above, nobody can actually use the module until
use_foo().  What's the difference?

Of course, and you might consider actually reading my [RFC].  We still
disagree on whether your fat interface or my thin one is the right way
to go.  Don't forget that the Unix way has traditionally been to use
the simplest interface that will do the job; if you propose a fat
interface you need to prove that the thin one cannot do the job.
