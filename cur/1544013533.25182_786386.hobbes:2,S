The gentoo panel last OLS.  (Either a BOF or a tutorial, I don't remember 
which.)  It's still _possible_ to build it from source, but they created a 
separate "openoffice-bin" package for the sole purpose of _not_ compiling it 
from source, and it's what they recommend installing.

Apparently not for Open Office.
First hit googling "gentoo openoffice install":
http://grokdoc.net/index.php/Gentoo-OpenOffice.org
The next two hits are bug tracker entries, and the one after that:
http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/gentoo-linux-help/71086-installing-
openoffice-question.html
Contains this cut and paste from emerge output:
These are the packages that would be merged, in order:
Calculating dependencies
!!! All ebuilds that could satisfy "openoffice" have been masked.
!!! One of the following masked packages is required to complete your request:
- app-office/openoffice-2.0.4_rc1-r1 (masked by: package.mask, package.mask, 
~am d64 keyword)
# 2005/10/24 Simon Stelling <blubb@gentoo.org>
# Don't even try to compile openoffice-2.x, it won't work.
But not to go too far down this rathole, I'm just using openoffice as an 
example here.  If you want to talk about it more, take it off list please.
