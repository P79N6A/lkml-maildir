Just curious: what's the setup here? (CPU speed, peripherals, distro,
applications being run to load the system, etc.) You may have described
this elsewhere on LKML and I may have missed it (sorry, I just can't
read everything that comes through).
I'm assuming that the timings are measured using the tracing
functionality currently in the patches.
Thanks,
Karim
