Thanks.  I'm sure people already thought of this long ago, it's basically just 
the usual "In Unix, everything's a file".  Until you ran into that
problem where the jvm was stealing your signals, though, I hadn't seen
a situation where having signals behave like files would be important.

There is a (non-threadsafe) convention that Jamie Lokier pointed out
for finding an unused thread.   If we allowed sigopen(-1) to allocate
a new signal for you, it'd probably just use the same scheme...

Yes.

What's the biggest change you see?  From my (two-martini-lunch-tainted)
viewpoint, it's just another kind of signal masking, sorta...

You're welcome (and I'll tell Eunice you liked her idea!).
