Oh, it wasn't Larry who caught anybody cheating, it was us who caught
ourself just getting ridiculous numbers. It was very clear that without
touching the pagces some way the benchmark was worthless - is basically
opened itself up to being optimized away. I was the one (or at least one
of the ones) that asked for the benchmark to be changed for that reason
(it does have my name in it now).
It' sjust that when I say "touch", I don't mean "write"..
