Like the no choice if having one's 11 year old syster try to use the
thing?
Text-mode and X11 seem to work fine if you walk on egg shells but just try
switching from console to text mode and back again several
times.  Eventually it _will_ crash.  Or worse yet mix svgalib and X11.
My brother and sister both used to crash my system at least 3 times a week  
before framebuffer + fbdev came into play.
