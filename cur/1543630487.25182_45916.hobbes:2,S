And how exactly do you suggest to type that command if the kernel panics?
If he had kdb he could do "mds saved_command_line 100".
I suspect that whatever is he using for creating the images (what is this
"isolinux.cfg"?) has modified the boot command line and that is why it
fails. It works fine for me (and worked since the time I wrote it around
2.4.0 or so).
