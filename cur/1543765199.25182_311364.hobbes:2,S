Errrr...sorry, /me no comprende but I get the idea :)
Going back to the API problem I guess it'd be possible to code 
an equivalent of __prio_boost [your fusyn_setprio()], 
but it still does not answer another underlying problem. 
mutex_setprio() won't take into account the case where a task
(1) takes a mutex, (2) it is boosted for that, (3) it (or somebody 
else) changes its priority and then (4) it is deboosted. 
[4] will deboost it to the prio (static or RT) it had before 
boosting (at [1]), not the new one set at [3] (am I right, Ingo? I
didn't see any hooks in sched_setscheduler() and friends).
Now, this would be easy to solve: do a hook up in any function that
is going to touch the priority, and then for every owned mutex,
go updating the mutex->owner_prio. 
And now the underlying problem: this is where it gets plenty of 
complex when you have to implement PI transitivity--suddenly whenever
I boost an owner I have to walk all the mutexes that it potentially
owns. This becomes O(fugly) the minute you have an ownership chain
deeper than two or three levels with each owner owning more than a
couple of mutexes.
So that's why I chose to put it in the task struct, it becomes O(1)
at the expense (granted) of having to calc a min each time we compute
the dynamic priority.
But these are implementation details

Naaah :)
