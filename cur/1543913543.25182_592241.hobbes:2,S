This sounds like a good approach. How does aufs handle low memory
situations? Union mounts seem to be quite common on low memory embedded
systems. Is there a way for the VM to signal to aufs/the union
filesystem to trim its cache? Also on the memory consumption front I
guess you could get the union fs to refer to a singleton name entry
directly instead of creating a new virtual inode et al. This may lead to
some unusualness though for mounts over different filesystems that have
different length directory files (eg vfat and ext3). This does run
counter to the model described above in some ways.
