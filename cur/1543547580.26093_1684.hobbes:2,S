I agree.
The "send data from already pinned buffers" case is different. That is
basically why "sendfile()" exists, and why TUX gets good numbers. Once you
get away from the "zero copy from user space" mentality, and start just
passing kernel buffers around, things look a lot better.

You really should look into using the page cache if you can: that way you
have a very natural way of looking at it and possibly changing the stream
in user mode with no extra copies for that side either.
I'm not saying that you should necessarily actually go to a "real file",
but the best way of allowing user-space access to things like this is
through mmap(), and if you make it look like the page cache you'll get a
lot of code for free...
