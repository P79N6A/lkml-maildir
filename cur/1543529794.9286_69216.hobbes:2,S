Hi!
Kernel 2.2.14
make CFLAGS=-g zImage
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release) 
Error:
-------------
sched.c:871: fixed or forbidden register 7 (sp) was spilled for class
GENERAL_REGS.
This may be due to a compiler bug or to impossible asm
statements or clauses.
-------------
Without the CFLAGS=-g the kernel translates w/o problem.
Did anybody get this error already? Is it a bug of egcs?
Thanks,
Thomas.
