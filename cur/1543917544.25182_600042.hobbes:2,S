hm, I found a patch at the end of an email trail which is datestamped Sep
20 here which appears to match the first one you mentioned, but I'm having
trouble working out what patch subject your "sb1250-mac" maps onto.
This is why I make the patch filenames map directly from the patch titles,
so I end up with files like
optimize-x86-page-faults-like-all-other-achitectures-and-kill-notifier-cruft.patch.
 Verbose, but it reduces confusion and mistakes.

That's always a good choice.  Patches which are dangling at the end of an email
discussion often don't get merged: it is unclear to the receiveing party that
the discussion has terminated, and I'm never terribly confident in the testing
level of a patch which obviously got modified two minutes before it was sent.
