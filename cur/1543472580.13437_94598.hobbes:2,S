No help, but some additional data..
I see the same thing.  I just did a trace immediately after such an event
and most of the time the kernel is in do_check_pgt_cache.
Here, I'm (p955 is pine) doing next/scroll through it until the 'storm'
hits.  System is otherwise idle.

Since I'm having no problems with anything except pine, I've been assuming
that pine is doing something wrong and just ignoring it.
