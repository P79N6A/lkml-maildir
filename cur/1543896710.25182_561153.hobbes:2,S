Tell me, i'm wrong, if similar thing cannot be implemented here.
Again, key word is _tracking_ system...
Just trying attract attention, that time of ignorance and manual work
must be ended. There must be new time, time of *tracking*, *counting*
opinions and any kernel work anybody want to contribute. I just got bored
after repeatings like, not funny work, code, etc. The manager, who will
do that not funny work is automated tracking system. Based on e-mail,
with additional tools, like
* ``reportbug''-- reporting (imroved REPORTING-BUGS,
  EVERY-WORK-IS-APPRECIATED-THANK-YOU)
* ``bts''-- command line interface, etc.
I want to change it, and i will try to work on that. Important thing is
-- to be in the corner *alone*, even with good, open source example system 
as Debian BTS is not gonna work.
WRT this, opinions and doings of people in this thread, who spend in
Linux development much more time, than i, just counter productive (fine,
fine but i have a right to have different, wrong opinion on that :).
