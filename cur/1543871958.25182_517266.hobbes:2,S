What I would be looking for is a way via e.g. "git commit" (to my 
project tree on kernel.org)
to pass it an option to send a copy of the patch to lkml or some list 
(or perhaps the reverse,
set a flag that says don't bother mirroring patch for review to fsdevel 
or lkml).  With Samba,
some people just watch all commits, but for the kernel that is way too many.

Yes agreed (watching fsdevel is easier than scanning every new -mm 
patch) - but I would rather not
bore people, and make them waste time on fsdevel or lkml looking at 
every single cifs patch.  Only about
three of the past 10 cifs patches were interesting enough to ask for 
detailed review (and I would
have loved an easier way to get review on those - as I would love to get 
more review of
Q's interesting DFS patch - but it is hard in practice to make this easy).
