  I suspect you have tuned your system to the max, but I will mention
using 32 bit transfers on all drives, read ahead via hdparm, etc.

  Possibly contention? Try smaller read sizes and see if the rate goes up.
Also, your strip size is small for stuff like this, for high volume
sequential data I used 256k. That was SCSI, though.

  That looks like a hardware issue to me. I haven't looked at this
closely, but does the fallback include switching to PIO mode on errors
like this?

  Good to eliminate, however.
