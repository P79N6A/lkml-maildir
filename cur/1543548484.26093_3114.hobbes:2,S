Whilst that makes sense, I can't see it really happening.  I dunno, I
guess it's down to Linus/Alan to work out if they can be bothered to
have yet another step before they make a tarball.  Perhaps if they have
makefiles or something to automate the tarring/diffing etc then they'll
just have to add this and then it will work?
Maybe I'm dreaming :)

Yes, but I would see it mainly just for userland utilities that need to
be upgraded between kernel releases.
