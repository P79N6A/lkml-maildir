It depends on whom you talk to. The generic feedback ways don't work
well at all, 80% of issues are apparently dropped, no chance to query
status from the outside, and it takes ages until something happens.

Non-issue.  SuSE 9.1 PRO:
$ rpm -qf /usr/bin/cdrecord
cdrecord-2.01a27-21
$ /usr/bin/cdrecord -version
ZY�$: Operation not permitted. WARNING: Cannot set RR-scheduler
ZY�$: Permission denied. WARNING: Cannot set priority using setpriority().
ZY�$: WARNING: This causes a high risk for buffer underruns.

Cdrecord-Clone 2.01a37 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 1995-2004 J�rg Schilling
/opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: Warning: Running on Linux-2.6.8.1
/opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: There are unsettled issues with Linux-2.5 and newer.
/opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: If you have unexpected problems, please try Linux-2.4 or Solaris.
I read the discussion as though these issues had been settled with
Linux 2.6.8. Is 2.01a37 too old to be aware of the fix or is there an
issue left with finding the "right" header files?
