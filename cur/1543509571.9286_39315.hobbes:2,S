Subject: 2.3.18ac5 NFS client: negative dentry caching

Try the following:
	client: remove an existing file
	server: create file again
	client: try to open file
The file won't be found unless you wait a
second (or so) before opening the file. Some time
ago I got the impression that acdirmin=0 would fix
this caching feature but even with "noac" the
problem^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hfeature is present.
How can I switch this off?
