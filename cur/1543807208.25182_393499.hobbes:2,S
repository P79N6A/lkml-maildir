This seems to be misfiled.  Why do you think this is a serial bug?
It seems to be talking about parallel ports.

This seems to be because we have an explicit vendor/device ID listed
in 8250_pci for (according to this bug report) something which isn't
a serial device.  What I don't know is if these vendor/device IDs
also exist for something which is a serial device.  Hence, removing
them could cause more problems than keeping them.  Since it has no
effect other than causing extra ports to appear, this is low priority.

No idea what's happening here.  No one else seems to be using IRQ3,
we've disabled the interrupt at the UART, yet we get a stuck IRQ3.
Don't think it's serial related, it just happens that closing the
serial port shows it.

This isn't a serial bug - it's a bluetooth ldisc bug.  I reported it
to the bluetooth folk back when it first got raised by Pavel.  However,
they seem to be completely disinterested in fixing it.
Unfortunately, there isn't a category for bt crap in bugzilla, otherwise
I'd reassign it.  Please kick the bt folk.
