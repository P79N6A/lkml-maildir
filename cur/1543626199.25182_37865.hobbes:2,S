Hello,
`make xconfig` spits out this error message after I'm done configuring
2.5.7:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
ERROR - Attempting to write value for unconfigured variable
(CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_PCMCIA)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here's part of my .config file. Note that CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_PCMCIA is
nowhere to be found in .config, not even commented out. The "Parallel
port support" configuration screen displays the entry "Support for
PCMCIA management for PC-style ports" twice, and the first of the two
entries is tri-state, but not greyed out. None of the three options can
be selected though. The second one is greyed out.
CONFIG_PCMCIA=y
CONFIG_PARPORT=y
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=y
CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_CML1=y
Anybody else seeing this problem?
