2.6.10 (whatever comes with Ubuntu Hoary).  It's a demo install for a
client on cobbled together hardware.  First I suspected the bleeding
edge GeForce video card, then we swapped it which didn't help.  Now I
suspect the hard drive (or a kernel bug).
And I was wrong, it wasn't more Oopses, it was "scheduling while atomic"
messages that forced the interesting stuff offscreen.
