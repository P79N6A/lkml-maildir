That's still pretty expensive. The LART (see .sig for URL) prototypes
didn't cost more than $600 each. In a small run (~ 100 LARTs) this drops
down to $250, and in even larger runs it will even be cheaper. The
StrongARM SA-1100 CPU is more than capable to run a fileserver, a Crusoe
is way too fast IMHO.
