At least the 'dump' that comes with Fedora Core 1:
dump 0.4b34 (using libext2fs 1.34 of 25-Jul-2003)
complains:  "ACLs in inode #%ld won't be dumped" (for some value of %ld)
when dumping files that have been tagged by SELinux.
http://dump.sourceforge.net/
 disavows the existence of newer than 0.4b34.
It hasn't been a big issue for me, as I can re-run /usr/sbin/setfiles if I
restore. But (a) it's very noisy and liable to hide real errors and (b) any
other not-easily-recreated use of ACLs is a problem...
