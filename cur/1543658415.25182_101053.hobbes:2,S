Robert, could you comment on whether it's really needed to have the 
preemt option defined architecture-dependant?
After looking through the arch/*/Kconfig files it seems to me that the
most problematic things might be architecture-specific parts of other
architecturs that don't even offer PREEMPT and the depends on CPU_32 in
arch/arm/Kconfig.

IMHO your comments are very valuable.
