It may not be obvious, but it is the design and purpose of marking exports
GPL.

That's true. The DMCA doesn't prevent it, since marking symbols is *not* a
license enforcement mechanism.

Of course.

Of course. (The only people who argue otherwise are the 'linking makes a
derivative work' idiots.)

Perhaps, since people seem to be trying to refight the same battles again.
The agreement made when the feature was added was that EXPORT_GPL was not a
license enforcement mechanism but was an indication that someone believed
that any use of the symbol was possible only a derivative work that would
need to be distributed under the GPL.

Anyone can argue anything. That would be an obviously stupid argument.
Perhaps clearer documentation might be helpful, but the GPL speaks for
itself.

They serve as a warning and, as a practical matter, may make it a bit more
difficult to violate the license.
