I think that's the key question here whether we need to enable this on
production systems? If yes, why? If it's just a debugging aid, then I
see Ingo's point of save_stack_trace(); otherwise the low-overhead
__builtin_return_address() makes more sense.
And btw, why is this new file not in /sys/kernel....?
