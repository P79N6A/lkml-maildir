The duplicated things obviously won't be merged (unless they're doing it
better somehow), so there's no issue there.
As to the use of LRU pages, this can be disabled with a simple sysfs
setting, so it doesn't need to be a big issue.

There's no memory leak. In Suspend2 (and I believe swsusp, but will
admit I haven't carefully checked), every call to freeze processes has a
matching call to thaw them. The thaw call will invoke make_fses_rw,
which will free the memory that was allocated. If there's an issue, it's
that in the failure path thaw_bdev can be called when freeze_bdev was
never invoked. Having just realised that, I've just fixed it.
Regarding the problem not existing, I'll try to find time to reproduce
it later in the day. Maybe the XFS guys have fixed it since I last
checked, but I do know there was a real issue (even if you haven't seen
it). That said, yesterday was my Red Hat day, so I'm not promising that
I'll be quick.

I'll seek to address this too.

But that's a different issue - uswsusp is suspend to disk. Your s2ram
thing is suspend to ram (although I guess you're somehow invoking it as
a library or something for suspend to disk + ram).
