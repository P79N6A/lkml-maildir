Hi Mark,
   This patch is fine, but it's better to do it from skb_xmit_done().  Of 
course, this is usually called from an interrupt handler, so it's not 
entirely trivial: we can't free the skbs there.
   A softirq is probably the answer here, but AFAICT that's old fashioned.  
Not sure what the right way of doing this is now...
Rusty.
