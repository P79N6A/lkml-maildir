the PAE pgd 'anomaly' should not affect this case, because we never clear
neither user-space pgds, nor user-space pmds in PAE mode. Unless we start
swapping pagetables i dont think this will ever happen in the future. The
PAE anomaly only affects the four top-level pgds, so even if we started
swapping pagetables, we'll never have to swap the pgds themselves.
i completely agree with the need to clean the pte-setting atomicity
interface up. And getting rid of cmpxch8b will be a definite performance
(and GCC-optimization) improvement.

yep, the two 32-bit writes idea is very nice - this should be safe - and
there isnt even any need for any barriers (except optimization barrier),
given that writes are strongly ordered on x86.
my gut feeling is that all these things will only benefit PAE support, and
the risk of those changes is low, none of those should bite us in the
future, design-wise. And it's also a nice speedup. And after this we could
finally get rid of the 'unsigned long long' as well and just define two
32-bit fields in pte.
