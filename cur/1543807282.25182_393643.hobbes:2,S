Do we need a place to put hotfix patches, or do we just need a list of
links to lkml postings to said patches.  Such a list has the advantage
of pointing into the discussion surrounding each such fix, and such a
list has the advantage of not holding so much redundant data (these
patches will be redundant with what was posted on lkml).  Redundant
data out of context goes stale, and is less valuable.
I can imagine someone (not me ;) keeping a wiki web page, listing for
each *-mm and Linus release the particular lkml patch postings that one
needs to pick off to get a build and boot.
Just brainstorming ...
