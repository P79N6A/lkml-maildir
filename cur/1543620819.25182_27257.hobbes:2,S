Hi,
I'm currently wondering how to implement the recent thread_info changes
for m68k, unfortunately I can't find any discussion about it on lkml,
why it was done this way.
1. I more liked the previous byte fields instead of the bitmasks.
bitfield/bitmask instructions are at least 2 bytes longer than a simple
test instruction for m68k. I got this now nicely optimized (see
http://linux-m68k-cvs.apia.dhs.org/c/cvsweb/linux/arch/m68k/kernel/entry.S?rev=1.6&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup
)
and changing it back to bitmasks would make it worse again.
2. I can understand that we split the task structure from the stack, but
why have thread_info and task_struct to be two different pointers? I'd
prefer two keep one pointer, through everything is accessed, that means
thread_info would be part of task_struct.
bye, Roman
