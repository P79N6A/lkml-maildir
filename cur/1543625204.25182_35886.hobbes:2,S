HI.  Using kernel 2.5.6 and the included alsa drivers and the beta 12
libraries and utilities I get lots of messages like the following:
Mar 18 20:23:32 ccs kernel: ALSA pcm_lib.c:184: Unexpected hw_pointer
value (stream = 1, delta: -2048, max jitter = 16384): wrong i\nterrupt
acknowledge?
This is with the via8233 sound card.
Any assistance would be appreciated.
