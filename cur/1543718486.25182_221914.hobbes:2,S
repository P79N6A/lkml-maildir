You both indicated on the LKML list that you have an ASUS laptop and
after a suspend, ACPI interrupts are not received.  It seems no
resolution to this is posted on the LKML list.  Have either of you
figured out how to fix this?
I have an L3800C and have gotten S1 and S3 sleep working, but for both
after resuming, acpi interrupts are no longer processed.  (no more
interrupts in /proc/interrupts)  I have tried various combinations of:
    acpi=noirq
    pci=noacpi
    acpi_irq_balance
    pci=usepirqmask
and this always happens, regardless of whether the acpi interrupt is
shared.
Thanks,
