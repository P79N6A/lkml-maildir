Subject: [patch 02/13] gameport: implement stubs to make OSS drivers buildable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/29/22

From: Adrian Bunk <bunk@stusta.de>
Input:
This patch adds dummy gameport_register_port, gameport_unregister_port
and gameport_set_phys functions to gameport.h for the case when a driver
can't use gameport.
This fixes the compilation of some OSS drivers with GAMEPORT=n without
the need to #if inside every single driver.
This patch also removes the non-working and now obsolete SOUND_GAMEPORT.
This patch is also an alternative solution for ALSA drivers with similar
problems (but #if's inside the drivers might have the advantage of
saving some more bytes of gameport is not available).
The only user-visible change is that for GAMEPORT=m the affected OSS
drivers are now allowed to be built statically (but they won't have
gameport support).

-# If GAMEPORT is built in, everything is fine.
-# If GAMEPORT is a module, however, it would need to be loaded for the

-# express it. SOUND_GAMEPORT boils down to "if GAMEPORT is 'm',
