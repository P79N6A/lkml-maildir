Err, there should be a default usr/initramfs_list - was this deleted by
the patch that added the initramfs_list generation script?  It would be
nice to see the V=1 output.  There might also be a problem with O=<dir>
here so that the default usr/initramfs_list isn't used.

You are, of course correct.  Where do you suggest that I put the
documentation?  Should I make changes to
Documentation/early-userspace/README?
BTW, I have to make an emergency trip for the rest of the week and I may
not get to this until next week.
