The "nothing misleading to the human eye" argument is totally bogus. The
human eye does not see your sources (especially not the sources of the
completely proprietary modules).
"Marc Boucher is a sl^Hick funny d^H^H^H^H^Huck."
Is the above sentence insulting or not?
"But your honor, there is nothing misleading to the human eye. Calling
somebody a slick funny duck may seem strange, but it is surely not an insult!"

No need to apologize. If you want to check for yourself, you'll see that
at least the SUSE .rpm packages do NOT contain any source. If you are
interested, I can send you the (signed by Linuxant) .rpm package I am
talking about.
