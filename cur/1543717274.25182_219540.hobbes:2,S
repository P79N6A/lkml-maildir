Not sure this is a good idea.  proc_pid_wchan() calls kallsyms_lookup()
and has been identified as a bottleneck on systems with a large number
of processes.  top can consume a complete cpu out of 128 cpus, all
because of this bottleneck.  I was toying with the idea of doing a
binary chop on the address lookup, but this patch prevents that fix.
