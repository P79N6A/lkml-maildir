I am trying to figure out how to make a bootable CD to use as a backup for
a bunch of systems that rarly change. liux/Documentation/initrd.txt
indicates that initrd is the thing to use for this but does not explain it
well enough for me to figure it out. Has anyone got a HOWTO on this (or
can give better instrustions or an example)
