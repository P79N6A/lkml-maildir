Yes.  In 2.3, look at the the raw IO code in drivers/char/raw.c.  It
uses the "kiobuf" mechanism to locate the "struct page *"s associated
with an arbitrary user buffer: map_user_kiobuf() does all the hard
work.  The driver can then use those pages in any way it wants.

It's a bit more complex than that, but map_user_kiobuf() takes care of
it.  There's a version for 2.2 if you want it.
