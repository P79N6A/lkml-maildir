If this is the RedHat system you mentioned in your post on sym53c8xx
loading oddity, then you need apply the fix below which I posted to
LKML on Jan 19th.

If you're running a RedHat system, you'll also need the following
patch to /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit. Without it the kernel's modprobe and
hotplug functionalities will be disabled by rc.sysinit.

(RedHat users should also comment out or remove the /sbin/update line in
/etc/inittab, but that's unrelated to the use of modules.)
