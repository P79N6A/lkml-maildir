Uhhuh. I can quite understand not wanting to upgrade from libc4 / a.out
binaries, but I can't understand sticking with libc4 & a.out, and then chucking
the 2.2 / 2.3 kernel on it. That's just weird. Why not stick with 1.2.13 or
2.0.37? If there are outstanding bugs in those versions they can be maintained
by whoever is interested -- I assume you patch libc4, so how would this be
different?
The theory is that after a major version or two we can drop the really old
stuff. It's not doing harm /per se/, but it's nice to view the current kernel
source as a reference implementation (reasonably) unencumbered by cruft.

Backwards compatability is good in moderation.
If you have binaries for which you have no source, they *will* eventually
break. Binaries without source should IMHO be viewed as unsupportable[1].

[1] And I include commercial products in that. My life has become a lot less
stressful since I stopped having to work with Win95/8, NT, SCO, VMS.. Though
I agree with you that the libc-of-the-month that gets shoved in distributions
is somewhat irritating. Where did I put that OpenBSD CD?
