It's only a single block we're talking about, not all the overhead you run 
into with huge amounts of attributes in many xattr disk blocks. It sure would 
be much cleaner to use the root inode's in-inode space like with all other 
inodes, but performance wise I don't think it matters.

Agreed, that would be really bad. We should get e2fsck fixed ASAP.

We cannot ask the user, and we don't have the kind of global view that e2fsck 
has. Something different may be messed up, and may have lead to the 
corruption. It's unlikely, but not impossible.
