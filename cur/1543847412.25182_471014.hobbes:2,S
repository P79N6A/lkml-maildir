Hi Alan,
your commit commit 67cc0161ecc9ebee6eba4af6cbfdba028090b1b9
"specialix - remove private speed decoding" converted the variable baud 
from an index in the array baud_table[] to containing the baud value 
itself.
Unfortunately, it contains at least two bugs:
The Coverity checker spotted that the following line was forgotten:
           baud = (baud_table[baud] + 5) / 10;   /* Estimated CPS */
BTW: After the trivial fix, baud_table[] could be removed.
While looking at the patch, I noticed it contains another bug that is 
not that easy to fix:
-       if (baud == 15) {
+       if (baud == 38400) {
                if ((port->flags & ASYNC_SPD_MASK) == ASYNC_SPD_HI)
                        baud ++;
                if ((port->flags & ASYNC_SPD_MASK) == ASYNC_SPD_VHI)
                        baud += 2;
        }
Increasing the index for baud_table[] by 1 or 2 is quite different from 
increasing baud by 1 or 2.
