One reason: Not all hardware has the signals needed to detect when a card
gets plugged or unplugged.  Consider legacy cPCI systems.  The don't have
the Hot Swap extensions or backplane hot swap control.  The only way to find
the cards is to periodically scan the bus for new cards, cards that
disappeared, or requests for Hot Swap.
