Subject: [Patch/RFC]Removing zone and node ID from page->flags[0/3]

Hello. 
I updated my patches which remove zone and node ID from page->flags.
Page->flags is 32bit space and 19 bits of them have already been used on
2.6.9-rc2-mm2 kernel, and zone and node ID uses 8 bits on 32 archtecture.
So, remaining bits is only 5 bits. In addition, only 3 bits have remained
on 2.6.8.1 stock kernel.
But, my patches make more 8 bits space in page->flags again.
And kernel can use large number of node and types of zone.
These patches are for 2.6.9-rc2-mm2. 
Please comment.
Bye.
