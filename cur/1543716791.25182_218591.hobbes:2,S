> Len, Martin: please review?
Looked already (in fact I suggested he do that). Looks fine, it's 
exactly the same fix we use for Summit.  Since we're using the other
method instead of the bitmap, this check isn't needed, so we can just
bypass it. This way also has the great advantage of being isolated
to the bigsmp subarch, so it only needs testing there ;-)
Thanks,
M.
