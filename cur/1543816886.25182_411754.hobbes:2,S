Data point:
I run into swap all the time on my 1gig machine.  There are a few reasons for
this.
* Applications are incredibly bloated.  Just running a bunch of gnome apps
  sucks down 1000 megs almost instantly.  However, these apps don't seem to use
  most of the space they bloat into, so after a bit of fighting for VM the
  chaff gets forced out and they run fine.
* Apps are also incredibly buggy.  Eg. Firefox seems to leak up to 50 megs per
  second in some workloads, so I run it for a day or two and my machine tends
  to go heavily into swap.
* VM system prefers disk cache over applications.  Eg. updated runs at 
  3am and indexes all my files.  Since the applications were idle, the 
  VM decides to page out all my executables and fill my ram with page 
  cache which is only used once.  In the morning, my machine spends a few
  minutes paging everything back in.
* Similarly, I have a 2gig machine available, and it's also showing about 512MB
  swapped out and also 500MB free.
