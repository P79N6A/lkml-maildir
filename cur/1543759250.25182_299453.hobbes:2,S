Actually the current (ab)use of the patent system (both in the USA and
by the EPO under pressure of you-know-who) does neither of these things
- it simply promotes the *commercial exploitation* of sciences and art.
Interesting enough that arts are mentioned in this thread - one more
point that it is a question of time until all (other) kinds of arts is
covered by patents (probably because you can do it on a computer).

The 17/20 years for patents are also defined in TRIPS - so changing
these to some saner value (given the speed of development in the IT
world) is not an option (as pointed out by all patent-promoters at all
opportunities).

ACK. And it is even worse: Currently the whole patent system is abused
and there is no regulation in sight (since neither the patent offices
nor large corporations have anything to loose with
illegal/trivial/priort art/... patents).

They help if you can pay your lawyer. This leaves corporations in the
game and the rest (small and medium companies, private folks) is lost -
sooner or later.
And BTW the bigger problem than software corporations (which can be sued
since they are violating lots of these software patents) are the patent
utilization companies which simply posses patents and (must) make money
of it. And this implies going to the court (or you pay beforehand -
since you/your company probably have no chance anyway to pay all the
costs - to avoid this).
Until this abuse is stopped, the patent system as a whole has a serious
problem.

IIRC he's now promising lawsuits (under certain conditions) with patents
- at least to Asian governments.
