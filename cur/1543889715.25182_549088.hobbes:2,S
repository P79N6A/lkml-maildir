More non retesting.

Hmm indeed. I actually had it correct at some point (i remember
fixing 64bit compile errors in sched-clock ;-). I guess the Makefile hunk 
accidentially dropped out during some later merging and this didn't get 
noticed due to the weak attribute.
That also explains the issue reported by Peter earlier I guess.
