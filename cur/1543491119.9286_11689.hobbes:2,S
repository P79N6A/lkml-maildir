I don't like read/modify/write cycles: this will sooner or later
cause problems on SMP systems. But I'll test you patch and tell you if
it
fixes the problem. (I have an UP machine)
I think that sys_swapon() and sys_mount() should use identical tests for
"device busy", currently sys_mount() only returns "busy" for 
filesystems, and tries to mount swap partitions, and sys_swapon()
only checks for swap partitions and tries to mount file system
partitions.
