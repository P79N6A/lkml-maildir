I did it the other way around, and moved kernel_map_pages to prep_new_page
so it's called before zeroing to keep that with the other prep bits
in buffered_rmqueue.  Made sense to me that kernel_map_pages is part of
prepping a new page, but this isn't my area, so I could be way off ;-)
It works for me with DEBUG_PAGEALLOC enabled.
