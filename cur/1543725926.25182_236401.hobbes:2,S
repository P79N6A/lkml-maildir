Sigh.. 
I have a 1Gb desktop machine that refuses to keep my applications in ram 
overnight if I have a swappiness higher than the default so I think lots of 
desktop users with more ram will be unhappy with higher settings.

Perhaps, but I really doubt desktop users running mainline would be happy 
about it going significantly higher.
