Well after reading Linus' post on pre9, I'm glad to say that everything
looks great.  Pre9 compiled and runs fine on both my K6 and UDB alpha
boxes.  For a while I was getting worried about late 2.1's and
2.2-pre patches not compiling on the alpha, but pre9 is great!  Many
thanks to all the kernel guys involved.
