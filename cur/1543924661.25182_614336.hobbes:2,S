Where are the objects that join this kset? A kset is a "collection of
objects of a similar type", If there are no objects, you don't need a
kset at all, I guess, but just a plain directory. :)
Anyway, seems we need an easy way to pass default attributes to ksets
and plain directories. If userspace should set some values here when a
subsystems creates the its sysfs representation, we must make sure, that
the attributes exist at the time the event is sent, otherwise we will
run into all sorts of timing problems.

Well, some users embedded ksets(subsystem) into objects, because it they
confused kobjects and ksets. So there may be a only very few valid users
left. :)
