Subject: Kernel 2.3.14/15/16 won't boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Previously reported for 2.3.14 and 2.3.15, now that I've tried 2.3.16 I
find nothing's changed, so here's another report:
[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
Linux kernels 2.3.14/2.3.15/2.3.16 won't boot
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
After compiling any of the above kernels, my system will not reboot with
them.  It gets through the AIC7xxx driver load and drive detection, then
goes into SCSI timeout messages, doesn't load /, and hangs there.  No oops,
nothing in any logfiles (since the root filesystem isn't loaded, not
unsurprising).  I've compiled these kernels with GCC 2.7.2.3, egcs-2.91.66
(egcs-1.1.2 release), or gcc 2.95 (990728 release).  I've also
enabled/disabled tagged queueing, and PIIX4 ACPI support in various builds
of the same kernel.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
kernel
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
2.3.14, 2.3.15, or 2.3.16 
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
N/A
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
