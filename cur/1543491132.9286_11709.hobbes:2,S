Hey Maestros
This version of cLIeNUX, a client-use Linux, is the one I'm going to 
start mouthing off about extensively, and I start here.
Some aspects of cLIeNUX may be of interest to some of you, so it's in 
good faith that I sway from the topic of this forum. I hope I don't
bore you.
cLIeNUX loop installs with a 887k  2.2.3 kernel with every filesystem type 
and HD I could get in the image. dmesg is a mess. Hopefully a good 
portion of what's in there will actually work. This is because the 
bulk of cLIeNUX loop is a loopback file. It's 15 meg gzipped, 43 meg 
ready to mount. 
As such cLIeNUX should demo nicely on a lot of different x86 machines.
cLIeNUX is the core of a full distro that doesn't exist. cLIeNUX 
builds and maintains itself, including the GNU C-only tools. Although 
there's no X, cLIeNUX is quite useable for many kinds of development.
As an example of how cLIeNUX is different than other distros, the Root 
floppy has a little script that puts up 2 Bash'es, and includes the 
"manpages" for sh, mount, ld, cat and ed from the
"UNIX Programmer's Manual", AT&T 1971.  Yes, 1971. With dmr's permission.
cLIeNUX is different.

Title:          loopcLIeNUX
Version:        19990325
Entered-date:   19990325
Description:    client-use-oriented Linux distribution.
		self-maintaining GNU/Linux with C-only gcc, runs and
		builds 2.2 kernels. Lots of documentation in HTML, no X,
		uses loopback file to demo or install from many different
		filesystem types. Much simplified from other distros.
		cLIeNUX attempts to provide docs in contexts where they
   		are most needed. As such, you are looking at the beginning
		of the installation instructions. cLIeNUX loop consists of
		3 files, cLoop.gz, cBoot and cRoot. The latter two are
    		install floppy images. You write them to floppies with dd   
		or rawrite.exe, boot with the cBoot floppy, and follow the
		instructions from there. Other notes in INSTALL.ASC
		cLoop.gz will be visible from any filesystem type that is
		readable by the Linux 2.2 kernel, which probably includes
		the filesystem of your current OS. cLoop.gz can also be
		unzipped and mounted by Linux as is. 
		Included; Lynx, zgv, sc, modules, 2.2.3 kernel, libc5, 
		EPIC/splitfire, gforth, slrn, pmail, pppsetup,
		SVGATextMode, Dvorak and azerty install
Keywords:       client simplified self-documenting newbie distribution
