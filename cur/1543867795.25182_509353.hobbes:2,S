I guess the header of include/linux/marker.h should go into
Documentation/marker.txt. Will fix. Will be in the next reply.

You can put markers at important locations in the code. They act as
lightweight hooks that can pass an abitrary number of parameters,
described in a printk-like format string, to a function.
They can be used for tracing (LTTng, LKET over SystemTAP), overall
performance accounting (SystemTAP). They could also be used to implement
efficient hooks for SELinux or any other subsystem the would have this
kind of need.

LTTng and LTTV, SystemTAP (should be updated to the new API).

Will fix for the next complete post.
