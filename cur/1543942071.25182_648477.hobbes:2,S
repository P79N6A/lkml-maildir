Linus, as there is no PCMCIA maintainer and akpm apparently wants you to 
merge this directly [1] -- what is your position on this one please? As 
far as I can see all the major issues that were raised during review were 
fixed by David, so there shouldn't be any obstacles to merging it. It 
would be nice if this driver will make it for 2.6.25 merge window.
Thanks,
