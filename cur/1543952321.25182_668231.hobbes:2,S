No. It shouldn't change them.

Secondary issues like the actual cost of context switch, but they are
generally in the noise compared to cache and tlb costs.

Linux desktops shouldn't run with massive loads anyway. Tuning the
scheduler to "work" well in an X session when you have a make -j100
in the background is retarded.
But sure, if the scheduler doesn't properly prioritize non-CPU bound
tasks versus CPU bound ones, then it should be fixed to do so.
