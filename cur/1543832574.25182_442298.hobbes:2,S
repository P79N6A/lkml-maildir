This is not a matter of any breakage or lack thereof.  The problem is that the
freezer is _not_ _an_ _swsusp-only_ _code_.  It is used by someone else too,
and having two different freezers in the tree would be _insane_, because too
many things depend on that.  This would be like having two different memory
management systems, but at a smaller scale.
As far as I'm concerned, we _must_ find a way to have _one_ common freezer,
before we can _think_ of anything more.  Still that's not even complicated,
because your freezer changes are quite well separeted, so please resubmit
them and we'll discuss them again.  Perhaps we'll be able to reach an
agreement on what's mergeable and what's not and why.  Then, I'll do my
best to get the mergeable stuff merged, and when it gets merged, you will
drop the non-mergeable freezer changes.  I hope this is fair enough.
