Not really. I doubt the person in the shop will care.
Incidentally, I've discovered that you really don't want to buy flash
devices from camera shops. It would seem that, like I guess might be
the case with certain "audio CD" blanks you buy in stores, they don't
seem to care about selling you a device with one or two known-bad
sectors. You won't notice 512 bytes of lost data in many JPEG images
(not that I am saying it's a good practice to have) but my Zaurus
/did/ notice when I couldn't reflash it from a CF card with a fault
somewhere around 8MB. After quite some time of screwing around with
the filesystem by hand, I was able to ensure that something else was
occupying the sector in question and eventually was able to reflash
(all because it was a Sunday afternoon and we have silly Sunday
trading laws here).
When I took the CF card back to the camera shop, I took the Zaurus and
did a test on potential replacement cards while in the store -
explaining that my PDA had a "CompactFlash tester" installed, or
something like that. It's amazing what you can get away with - akin to
spending an hour in the store when I got my replacement Powerbook
after finding a single bad pixel, testing every unit to find one
without any, just to be happy :-)
Jon.
