Thanks for working on this problem!

So the fact that this changes the behavior means that sk_inuse is taking
on negative values.  This can't be right--how can something like
svc_sock_put() (which does an atomic_dec_and_test) work in that case?
I wish I had time today to figure out what's going on in this case.  But
from a quick through svsock.c for sk_inuse, it looks odd; I'm suspicious
of anything without the stereotyped behavior--initializing to one,
atomic_inc()ing whenever someone takes a reference, and
atomic_dec_and_test()ing whenever someone drops it....
