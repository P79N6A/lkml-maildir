Subject: PS2 mouse broken going from linux 2.0.x --> 2.2.x on Digital HiNote
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/2/22/232

Computers Affected: six Digital HiNote laptops, 3 x CS450 & 3 x CT475
Symptoms: after a random period of mouse movement (between 1s and 30s), the
virtual console or X session being used locks up.  Computer runs as normal,
but no keyboard or mouse input is accepted; there is no feedback, no
beeping.  Killing gpm or X (as appropriate) restores the system to normal.
X or gpm can then be restarted, but the problem recurs after a further
period of mouse usage.
Conditions: no problems using any 2.0 kernel, including 2.0.38.  Tested
kernel 2.2.5, 2.2.10, and 2.2.14, and the problem occurs under all of these.
The mouse driver is compiled directly in, not as a module.  Unrelated to
PCMCIA or other services -- failure even in single user with only gpm
running.  Short, fast mouse movements are less likely to cause freezes than
long, slow, interrupt-intensive movements, like moving in circles.  By using
the mouse only sporadically, the system can be kept from crashing for some
time, perhaps indefinitely.
Kernel 2.2.14 PS/2 driver source file drivers/char/pc_keyb.c controls both
keyboard and mouse, a change from the 2.0 kernels:
 * Combined the keyboard and PS/2 mouse handling into one file,
 * because they share the same hardware.
 * Johan Myreen <jem@iki.fi> 1998-10-08.
This file appears to be the source of the trouble.
Questions: is this a known problem; is there a patch; is there anything I
can do about it, as an inexperienced C programmer?
