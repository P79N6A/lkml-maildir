Okay, with a trivial hack to have the thing initialise when builtin, 
sbpcd does pretend to work:
3y25:~$ uname -r
2.6.5
3y25:~$ mount | grep cdrom
/dev/sbpcd on /mnt/cdrom type iso9660 (ro,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
3y25:~$ ls /mnt/cdrom/
cd.id*        install.exe*  lecdemos/     readme.doc*   resource/ 
support/
However, any "cp" from cd-rom oopses the box.

I was actually planning to get around to that at some point. Somewhat 
fond of this drive. As you say, driver is a disaster area; a few trivial 
fixes are not what it wants and at this point, fixing it properly would 
not be a trivial undertaking for me. Am also currently very busy 
elsewhere. Could it be kept around a bit?
Rene.
