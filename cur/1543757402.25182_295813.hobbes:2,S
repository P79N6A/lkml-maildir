There was some recent discussion of this on linux-input. It was basically 
agreed that the input system should pass the request on to ACPI and/or apm 
and Dmitry Torokhov (cc'd) proposed a patch that did this. His patch needed 
to be slightly modified to work with arm apm, the final result being:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/2.6.11-rc4/input_power-r1.patch
I can confirm this works well on arm with apm enabled.
