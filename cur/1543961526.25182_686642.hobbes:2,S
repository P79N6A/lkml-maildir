Subject: [15/37] V4L: Fix VIDIOCGAP corruption in ivtv
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

2.6.25-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>
(cherry picked from commit d2b213f7b76f187c4391079c7581d3a08b940133)
Frank Bennett reported that ivtv was causing skype to crash. With help
from one of their developers he showed it was a kernel problem.
VIDIOCGCAP copies a name into a fixed length buffer - ivtv uses names
that are too long and does not truncate them so corrupts a few bytes of
the app data area.
Possibly the names also want trimming but for now this should fix the
corruption case.
