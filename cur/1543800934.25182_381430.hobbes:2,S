Noone wants to remove the drivers for hardware not supported by ALSA 
from OSS.
After 4 years of ALSA in the kernel we are starting to remove the OSS 
drivers from the kernel where ALSA drives the same hardware.
We might end up with a handful of OSS drivers for some ancient 
soundcards without ALSA support and keep them similar to the old CD-ROM 
drivers under drivers/cdrom/ (or someone might write ALSA drivers for 
such hardware), but we don't need two drivers for the same hardware.

Can you give me a bug number in the ALSA bug tracking system for this 
issue to track it?

How much RAM does your system have that this is really an issue for you?
Sure, it would be possible to make ALSA a bit slimmer, but if you are 
running something like KDE or Mozilla or OpenOffice on your Laptop the 
size of the kernel shouldn't be a real issue.
