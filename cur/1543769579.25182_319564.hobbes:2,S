Hrm, "tomorrow" became "two days from now," but here they are, kernbench
comparisons (in percent relative to mainline) for x86 and x86_64, 10
iterations each.
The x86_64 machine is a 2-way 2.0 GHz with 3.5 GB of RAM.
The x86 machine is 16-way (32 with HT) 1.4 GHz Xeon with 15 GB of RAM.
				x86
					Elapsed	User	System	CPU
2.6.12-rc4:				100%	100%	100%	100%
2.6.12-rc4 + John's patch:		100.3%	100%	99.8%	99.6%
2.6.12-rc4 + John's patch + my patch:	102.1%	101%	100%	98%
				x86_64
					Elapsed	User	System	CPU
2.6.12-rc4:				100%	100%	100%	100%
2.6.12-rc4 + John's patch:		99.5%	99.5%	99.1%	99.9%
2.6.12-rc4 + John's patch + my patch:	99.7%	99.7%	99.5%	100%

All in all, pretty consistent across the board.
Thanks,
Nish
