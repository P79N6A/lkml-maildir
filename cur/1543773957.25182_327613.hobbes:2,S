Reiser4 suggests a bit more file types than VFS is aware of. I don't even 
think VFS should be.  It is enough that VFS allows each inode/file/dentry  to 
behave own way.  IIRC VFS object's ->foo_ops is for that.   
Reiser plugins are for the same.  Would you agree with reiser4 plugin design 
if the plugins will not dispatch VFS object methods calls by themselves but 
set ->foo_ops fileds instead?  I guess you don't like to have the two 
dispatching systems at the same level.
