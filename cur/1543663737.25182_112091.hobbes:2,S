I tried. fglrx.o loads without errors, but when X starts I get a blank screen. The last thing that appears in the logs for XFree86 (version 4.2.99) is the drm initialization. The card and the XF86Config file both work fine under Linux if I use them with a machine that only supports 4x AGP and does not support AGP 3.0.

	That's good, but ATI 4.2.0-2.5.1. should work, try loading fglrx.o manualy:
telinit 3
insmod /path/fglrx.o
telinit 5
Then go and check ATI control panel, and please send me results, on my R9000 
it reports AGP4x which is OK, I hope it will be 8x for you.
