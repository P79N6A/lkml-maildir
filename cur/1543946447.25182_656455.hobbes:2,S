Had a quick look but couldn't find it. It was just two threads running
and switching to each other with a couple of mutexes or yield. If I
find it, then I'll send it over.

I'm not sure about P4 tuning... But even IMO it should not on
predictable branches too much for any (especially OOOE) CPU.

What I have seen is that they tell you definitely not to use it for
predictable branches. Eg. the Intel optimization manual says
 Use the setcc and cmov instructions to eliminate unpredictable
 conditional branches where possible. Do not do this for predictable
 branches. Do not use these instructions to eliminate all
 unpredictable conditional branches, because using these instructions
 will incur execution overhead due to executing both paths of a
 conditional branch. In addition, converting conditional branches to
 cmovs or setcc trades control-flow dependence for data dependence
 and restricts the capability of the out-of-order engine.

True, but if you know a branch is 99%+, then use of likely/unlikely
can still be a good idea. 80% may not be enough to choose a branch
over a cmov for example.
