Not caring about NMIs may have more impact than one could expect. You
have to be aware that (at least) the following code is executed in NMI
context. Trying to patch any of these functions could result in a dying
CPU :
default_do_nmi
  notify_die
  nmi_watchdog_tick
    printk
    die_nmi (should cause a OOPS, not kill the cpu..)
  do_nmi_callback
    unknown_nmi_panic_callback
      sprintf
  unknown_nmi_error
    panic
  reassert_nmi
In entry.S, there is also a call to local_irq_enable(), which falls into
lockdep code.
Tracing those core kernel functions is a fundamental need of crash
tracing. So, in my point of view, it is not "just" about tracing NMIs,
but it's about tracing code that can be touched by NMIs.

I'll let the Intel guys confirm this, I don't have the reference nearby
(I got this information by talking with the kprobe team members, and
they got this information directly from Intel developers) but the
int3 is the one special case to which the errata does not apply.
Otherwise, kprobes and gdb would have a big, big issue.
