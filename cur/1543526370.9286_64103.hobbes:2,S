Subject: Userland encrypted filesystem that root cannot access.

Are there any patches for the kernel, or userland solutions which
allow a user to mount an encrypted filesystem (perhaps through
loopback) which while mounted, root cannot read?  Or is this
concept beyond Linux currently?
I'm thinking of the case where the superuser can admin the
machine but due to confidentiality, the data must not be readable
by root under any circumstance.  Possible?
