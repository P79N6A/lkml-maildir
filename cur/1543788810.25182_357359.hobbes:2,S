I thought that's what the WBINVD did.  Either the problem is the delayed
write buffer or the fact that the store makes the lock cache line exclusive
which gives the processor unfair advantage if it immediately tries to
reacquire the lock.  WBINVD solves both of those problems.
Or you could use a spin lock implementation that didn't have that problem
to begin with.
