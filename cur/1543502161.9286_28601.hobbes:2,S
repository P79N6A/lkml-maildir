As far as I know, 2.2.10-ac8 was completely up-to-date with everything
in knfsd-1.3.4, except the changes to make lockd run from a 
separate user-space process. It also included a handful of other bug fixes.
Now that HJ Lu has explained the reasoning behind the lockd change, it should 
appear in Alan's next patch, I believe.
