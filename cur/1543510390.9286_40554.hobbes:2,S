Sorry for the extra message, but I thought I'd add some debugging info to
my last message in case anyone knows what's wrong.. while doing an strace
on playmidi, the lines that seem to be causing the errors are as follows

open("/dev/sequencer", O_WRONLY)  = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
open("/dev/sequencer", O_WRONLY)  = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
open("/dev/sequencer", O_WRONLY)  = -1 ENXIO (Device not configured)
write(2, "open /dev/sequencer: Device not "..., 43open /dev/sequencer:
Device not configured
) = 43
