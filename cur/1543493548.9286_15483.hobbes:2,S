I'll definitely take it. I can confirm what you say with more figures:
my Career Final Project was a RTOS, which I developed in DOS real mode,
and I was able to correctly deliver clock interrupts at more than 200
kHz on a pentium 166. I tried at 400 kHz and it started to miss some of
them.
Surely there is some kind of difference between getting interrupts from
the parallel port and getting from the PIT. And I think the only way to
know the maximun affordable interrupt rate is to use some kind of
internal int generator, _not_ an external one. Too many things in the
interrupt path...
