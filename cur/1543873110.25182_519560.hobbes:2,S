Well, its a matter of degree.  If your busy vcpu is sharing a real cpu
with 9 other busy vcpus, then you'll only see about 10% of the real cpu
cycles.  If we had legitimate loads in which 90% of the cpu were taken
up by interrupt processing, then I think we definitely would try to
account for that time properly.
SMM interrupts, in which the CPU is stolen from the kernel entirely, is
a better analogy.  But again, they're expected to be rare and
insignificant.  In a virtual machine, on the other hand, you could
expect the majority of cpu time to be stolen by other things running on
the same physical machine.
In other words, regardless of whether this particular pv_op lives or
dies, we're going to need to have to deal with stolen time properly.  I
think this hook is reasonable and useful step towards doing that.
