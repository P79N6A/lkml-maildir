Greetings,
s2ram recently became useful here, except for the kernel's annoying
habit of disabling my P4's perfectly good TSC.

I wonder why I'm the only guy in the galaxy experiencing this.  Does
everybody else's clock continue to move forward across resume or
something?  Anyway, I asked it to please stop doing that, and it
complied without even exploding (unlike crabby APICs).
