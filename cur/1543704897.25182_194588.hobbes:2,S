Actually, this isn't quite true -- the second case will also
use registers 2, 3, 4, and 5.
However, there is still a case where a single long long is
passed differently from a pair of longs: when there is only
a single register remaining for parameters.
This means that
  void f(int a, int b, int c, int d, long e, long f)
is passed as
  a-d in register 2-5
  e in register 6
  f on the stack (4 bytes)
while
  void f(int a, int b, int c, int d, long long e)
is passed as
  a-d in register 2-5
  nothing in register 6
  e on the stack (8 bytes)
Bye,
Ulrich
