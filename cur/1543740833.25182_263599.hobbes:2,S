Is there a compelling reason for changing all the parameter names?
I would prefer not to do that.  It is incompatible for our current
user base, and really does not seem like an improvement.  Those names
only appear in the context of `realtime', so the `rt_' is completely
redundant.  For example...
 # modprobe realtime gid=29
 # sysctl -w security/realtime/mlock=0
Also, you forgot to update the documentation.
