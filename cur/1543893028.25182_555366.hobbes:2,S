As a sysctl, the admin gets to choose between
compatibility and sanity.
I can see such a sysctl also being really helpful for a
shared computer used for an Operating Systems or
System Programming course.

Both are good. This one requires that all apps using
SysV shared memory be modified to use the flag.
The other requires that a very few apps be modified
to tolerate a behavior change.

I suspect that SMB/CIFS has a native call for this. There is
some sort of tmpfile flag defined over in that world.
