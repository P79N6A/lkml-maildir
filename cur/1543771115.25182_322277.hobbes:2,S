That's intended. Many readers and posters aren't subscribed.
E.g. I read it using news:linux.kernel, since my mail program can't handle
threads well enough. (Besides that, NNTP causes much less traffic for the
same amount of messages:). OTOH, I'd like to get replies to my postings per
mail, since my newsreader is bad for replying to lkml.
Workaround:
--- ~/.procmailrc ---
:0 Wh: msgid.lock
| formail -D 128 .msgid.cache
---
(adjust the 128 as needed)
