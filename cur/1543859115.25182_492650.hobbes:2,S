This is what I was thinking of.  Sometimes I find these kinds of calls a
bit annoying:
	foo(0, 1, 1, 0, 99, 22)
It only takes a minute to look up what all of the numbers do, but that
is one minute too many. :)
How about an enum, or a pair of #defines?
enum context
{
        EARLY,
        HOTPLUG
};
extern void memmap_init_zone(unsigned long, int, unsigned long, unsigned long,
                                enum call_context);
...
So, the call I quoted above would become:
	memmap_init_zone((size), (nid), (zone), (start_pfn), EARLY)
