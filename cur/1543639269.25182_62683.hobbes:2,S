Subject: Announce: daily 2.5 BK snapshots

Since Linus does not do pre-patches anymore, he mentioned some time ago 
it would be nice if somebody created an automated BK snapshot process to 
make BK changes accessible between kernel releases.  I've done that.
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/snap/2.5/
All BK changes not in the current 2.5 kernel release will be posted at 
this URL, in GNU patch form, on a daily basis.  [snap happens at one 
minute past midnight, California time]   The full changelog log is also 
extracted.  Each time Linus releases a new kernel, the contents of this 
directory will be wiped out.
Questions and comments welcome.
	Jeff
