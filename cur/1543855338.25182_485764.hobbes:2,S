I'd _much_ rather make it more readable while at it. Something like this 
instead, which has just _one_ "typeof" cast, and at least to me makes it a 
lot more obvious what is going on (aka "to align something, use a mask 
that is of the same type as the thing to be aligned..").
Maybe it's just me, but I prefer to separate out the actual "action" from 
the "type fluff" around it.
