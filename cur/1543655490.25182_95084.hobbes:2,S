These grub commands work with SUSE 2.4.19-4GB:
   kernel (hd0,0)/bzImage root=/dev/hda3   vga=791
   initrd (hd0,0)/initrd
But with 2.5.50 the kernel panics after Freeing the initrd memory with 
"Unable te mount root FS, please correct the root= cammand line"
I have compiled with the required file systems (EXT2,EXT3,REISERFS).
