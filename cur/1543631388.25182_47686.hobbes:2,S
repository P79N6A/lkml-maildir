I thought asymmetric multiprocessing would support CPUs with different
speeds.  ie, 400 & 450mhz.  How would you get different multipliers and same
Mhz when the CPUs are on the same FSB(ignoring AMD SMP where each processor
has an exclusive FSB, and this might be possible)?
IIRC, Linux supports SMP on CPUs with different stepping as long as the
features are the same, and even then it'll use the features of the boot CPU.
There was a patch to compare the different features on the CPUs available
and use the subset available on all processors.
