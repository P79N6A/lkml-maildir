Greetings...
From previous discussions on this list, It's been said that
you should use kiobuf's to do PCI dma directly to user space..
I can see that you can tell kiobufs to grab user pages, but
I must be missing something obvious because I can't seem to 
find out how to tell the user space program which pages 
kiobuf grabbed to mmap/read/whatever... 
are there any pointers, docs, etc on using kiobufs?
thanks,
john.c
