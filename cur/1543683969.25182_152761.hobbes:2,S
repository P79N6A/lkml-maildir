Thank you, that's the missing part. I will say that in limited use I have used 
aes and twofish and they seem to work correctly. I copied a bunch of data 
there, checked it against the md5 contents file and all data was correct, did 
a bunch of renames, slinks, compiles, etc. unmounted and remounted a few 
times. So far so good, this isn't critical data, but I'm leaning that way for 
my laptop.
All this with 2.6.0-test1-ac2.
Now, for the bizarre test case, suppose I did three encrypted losetups, each 
using a different encryption. Then I made a raid-5 array of the three loop 
devices. created a filesystem on the md device, and ran on that. Forget the 
practicality, this is a test to see of the parts are robust, can I do it and 
will it work?
Now make two of those filesystems losetups of NBDs. Now I can recover if any 
one machine is missing, no one can recover the data without compromising at 
least two machines. again, forget practical, this is a test and maybe has 
application to the devout fundamentalist paranoid. If I was going to do it 
I'd loopback mount the md device, too ;-)
