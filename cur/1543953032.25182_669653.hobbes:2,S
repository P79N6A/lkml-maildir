We have seen just how much we can trust that, haven't we?
The truth is that even secondary last-resort paths like this need to work
well, and as fast as possible.  As things stand, we DO excercise them a lot
more than we'd expect...

Sure, and one we should fix.  That doesn't change the fact that any broken
HW (or one hit by a kernel bug) that is not as broken as some Acers don't
need to take that 5ms hit on every EC transaction, in an EC mode that is
already way too slow without extra help.

Looks like something we should tack a WARN_ONCE to, at least when in a debug
mode compile?
