I don't clearly understand you. I am using mga driver which is in the
official xfrr86 release.

What if setting those W-only registers to their appropiate values on
console-switches?
Why isn't it done by the vesafb driver?
How is the mga fb driver handle handling this situation better?
ps: My problem is that I have to use exactly the same kernel on different
machines, and I need fb. If not all machines have mga, than mga fb is
no-go.
