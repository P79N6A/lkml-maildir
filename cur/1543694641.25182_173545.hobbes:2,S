We already have the `system_running' flag which is suitable for this.
I've been dithering over whether we should use it, mainly because doing
things like downing a semaphore before we've even called sched_init()
(cpufreq) is a happens-to-be-harmless but fairly dumb thing to do.
Yes, we should probably do something like this, but later.
