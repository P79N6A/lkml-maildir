Hey Roland,
Here are some bug fixes to the iw_cxgb3 driver that I'd like merged for
2.6.22.  The 1st patch has been posted before, but I didn't see it in
your for-2.6.22 branch, so I'm posting it again.  
Jeff, 
The last patch updates the cxgb3 required firmware version.  It is
included in this series because its required by the patch preceeding it
in the series.
Steve.
Shortlog:
