Nobody objected.  Bjorn Ekwall asked for my current patches on August
10 but there are still no updates from him, even after 15 days and 2
reminders.  So I reluctantly assume that Bjorn is too busy and declare
myself the new modutils maintainer.
The new URL for modutils source is 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/modutils.
Directory v2.2 exists to maintain the historical record, it contains
Bjorn's versions plus changes that were made to the CVS tree but had not
appeared in Bjorn's patches.  2.2.2-pre8 is equivalent to the modutils
CVS tree as of August 24, 1999.
Directory v2.3 is the current version.  2.3.0 is identical to
2.2.2-pre8, except that the repository has been changed from CVS to
PRCS.  I will not be using the CVS tree for modutils any more.  2.3.1
includes my patches for ksymoops support.  The major and minor numbers
will track the kernel numbers, the patch level will generally be
independent of the kernel.
If anybody has modutils patches that have not been included, send them
to <kaos@ocs.com.au>.  Please include modutils in the Subject line.
