I suspect it would.  The "-- \n" is a documented signature mark (took 
me a while to find this out) and I have found no way to make mozilla 
do anything different with it.  I don't have any documentation on 
"---" but it surly is not a signature mark and I suspect most mailers 
will not attach any signifigance to it.
