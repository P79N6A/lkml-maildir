Wrong problem, what is really needed is to get CPU scheduler choice into 
mainline, just as i/o scheduler finally did. Con has noted that for some 
loads this will present suboptimal performance, as will his -ck patches, 
as will the default scheduler. Instead of trying to make ANY one size 
fit all, we should have a means to select, at runtime, between any of 
the schedulers, and preferably to define an interface by which a user 
can insert a new scheduler in the kernel (compile in, I don't mean 
plugable) with clear and well defined rules for how that can be done.
