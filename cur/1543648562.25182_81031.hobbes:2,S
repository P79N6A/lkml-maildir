But why?  Save the call to get_wchan()...
Ideally I would like to remove the field altogether but thats too much
breakage.
A value of zero in the field position is an indication the wchan file
exists, too.
The ifdefs there do not bother me.  I think its pretty clear why its
being done, although I could add a comment to the "0UL" value saying
"now in /proc/#/wchan" or whatever.
But, no, I do not agree.  No human can parse /proc/#/stats anyhow. 
Since procps needs to be updated for 3.0 anyhow, it will be fine.
