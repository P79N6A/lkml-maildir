Why not just shut the door on new features after 6 months? Even if
they are things you personally would really like to see (like the I/O
and networking scaling changes), if they're not ready in time, they
have to wait for the next cycle.
Looking back at 2.3.x, we see that Ingo's I/O scalability stuff went
in really early, because it was "ready" ("ready" doesn't mean safe;-).
But the networking scalability stuff (aka softnet) didn't go in until
this year. Either it wasn't ready, so should have waited for 2.5 when
the patch was more mature, or it was close enough and it should have
gone in regardless. If it's OK to break the kernel for several
patchlevels for I/O changes, it's also OK for networking changes.
If you just want to manage one significant change at a time,
particularly if it's a bit rough around the edges, wait at least a
month before applying the next major patch, to make sure the previous
one has settled down. Or wait until the next cycle.
Even after the softnet patch went in, we kept being hit by more and
more scalability patches. And multiple VFS redesigns. We didn't
*really* need all these changes to go in before 2.4.

I don't think splitting the kernel development is the answer. Having
stuff separate is just too frustrating. I was so glad to see PCMCIA
drivers go into the kernel.
As for "microkernel". Ug. I see another flamewar coming.
PEOPLE: read the FAQ before you so much as breath that word on the
list, let alone post "well, why not?". <shudder>
Maybe you just need to get tougher with the cabal. You're pretty
hard-nosed when it comes to rejecting patches which so much as offend
your tastes (let alone those that suck). How about extending that to
timing? No matter how lovely the patch, if it's past feature-freeze,
reject it. Of course, come next cycle, said patch should go in
promptly.
Also, if there is a reliability problem somewhere, only accept patches
during feature freeze which do the minimum to fix the problem. Don't
let "bugfixes" be a back door to doing wholesale redesigns which fix
the problem along the way. Go for a surgical fix, not chemotherapy.
Too much chemo and the patient dies.
It's getting embarrasing when people ask me when 2.4 will be out. Not
only don't I know, AFAIK, nobody knows. And when of course they say
"but wasn't 2.4 supposed to come out last year, and didn't Linus want
a shorter cycle than 2.2?", I have to look away and mumble something
and hope they'll go away. Or try and change the subject. I can't keep
getting away with the brush-off. People are beginning to suspect.
