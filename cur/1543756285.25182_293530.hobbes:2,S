Subject: [uml-devel] [patch 0/2] uml: other important patches to merge before 2.6.11

Andrew Morton, this is another couple of fixes for UML to go in before 2.6.11 
release. The first is *really* trivial, the second is very important since it 
fixes a security problem (described in the changelog).
For the previous ones, I've seen they were merged quickly.
Thanks and regards
