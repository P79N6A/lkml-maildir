That's almost exactly how the driver behaves currently -- the message is
printed just once when the state is first noticed.  Nothing is printed 
when the state is cleared, and nothing gets printed repeatedly during the 
problem period.  But then the problem recurs very quickly.

That's true for every message in the kernel.  How do you decide which 
messages to rate-limit?
Note that this particular message will cause problems only in the presence 
of defective hardware.
