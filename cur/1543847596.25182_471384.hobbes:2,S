Or do you mean the migration ? Well, we have so far managed to avoid
walking the VMAs and thus avoid the mmap_sem during that migration, so
yes, we do take the object lock but not the mmap_sem.
The problem is that a get_user_pfn() (or get_user_pages if we are on the
memory backstore, besides, how do you decide from access_process_vm
which one to call ?) will peek PTEs and just use that if they are
populated. Thus, if the migration races with it, we are stuffed.
Even if we took the mmap_sem for writing during the migration on all
affected VMAs (which I'm trying very hard to avoid, it's a very risky
thing to do taking it on multiple VMAs, think about lock ordering
issues, and it's just plain horrid), we would still at one point return
an array of struct pages or pfn's that may be out of date unless we
-also- do all the copies / accesses with that semaphore held. Now if
that is the case, you gotta hope that the ptracing process doesn't also
have one of those things mmap'ed (and in the case of SPUfs/gdb, it will
to get to the spu program text afaik) or the copy_to_user to return the
data read will be deadly.
So all I see is more cans of worms... the only think that would "just
work" would be to switch the mm and just do the accesses, letting normal
faults do their job. This needs a temporary page in kernel memory to
copy to/form but that's fine. The SPU might get context switched in the
meantime, but that's not a problem, the data will be right.
So yes, there might be other issues with switching the active_mm like
that, and I yet have to find them (if some comes on top of your mind,
please share) but it doesn't at this point seem worse than the
get_user_page/pfn situation.
(We could also make sure the whole switch/copy/switchback is done while
holding the mmap sem of both current and target mm's for writing to
avoid more complications I suppose, if we always take the ptracer first,
the target being sigstopped, we should avoid AB/BA type deadlock
scenarios unless I've missed something subtle).
Ben.
