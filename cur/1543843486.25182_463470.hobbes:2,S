Subject: [patch] Kconfig: move CONFIG_EMBEDDED options to submenu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/15/4

Fix two problems with the CONFIG_EMBEDDED submenu:
(1) The menu was split in two by the rt_mutex patch, which moved
    half the items into the "General setup" menu.
(2) CONFIG_SYSCTL and CONFIG_UID16 were added to the main menu
    instead of the submenu.
