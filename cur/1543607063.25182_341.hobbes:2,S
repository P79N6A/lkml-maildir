I wonder if there are any Linux hackers in Iraq?  It's doubtful the government
there would honor any legal action attempted by the US on DMCA issues.  OTOH, it
would put me in the rather weird position of agreeing with the Iraqi government,
which is something I NEVER would have expected...  :-)

Alan Cox, living in the UK, may be *somewhat* subject to US legislation.
Ties between the US and the UK are strong, and it is understandable if a UK-
resident person does not feel entirely out of reach of US law enforcement.
IMHO.
