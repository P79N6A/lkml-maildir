I was copying figure skating tournament 2006 recordings from Windows (?)
SMB share. After a while cp hanged with
	Segmentation fault
The only thing in logs was
	CIFS VFS: Received no data, expecting 9207
	CIFS VFS: No response to cmd 46 mid 1127
	CIFS VFS: Send error in read = -11
OK, reboot, remount, recopying. Evething went fine except
cp: cannot stat `/home/ad/mnt/utaba/TV/-2006   //': No such file or directory
cp: cannot stat `/home/ad/mnt/utaba/TV/-2006   //2': No such file or directory
And dmesg cluttered with
