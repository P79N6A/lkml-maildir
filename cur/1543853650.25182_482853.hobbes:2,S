I would say that one reason is that cluttering up the kernel with
#ifdef's is ugly and annoying to maintain long-term. Especially when
it's expected that anyone who changes in-kernel interfaces also fix up
any user(s) of those interfaces, so the #ifdef's are pointless
(ignoring out-of-tree code that is).
