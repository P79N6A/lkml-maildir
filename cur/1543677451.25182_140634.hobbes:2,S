Hello!
   I am trying to teach smatch's unfree script of skbuffers as those could
   create memory leaks if not freed, and I come across this code in
   ./net/802/llc_sendpdu.c::llc_sendipdu() in 2.4.21 kernel:
                tmp=skb_clone(skb, GFP_ATOMIC);
                if(tmp!=NULL)
                {
                        tmp->dev = lp->dev;
                        dev_queue_xmit(skb);
                }
   (and tmp is not used anywhere else)
   Naturally looking at llc_sendipdu() function that have similar construction,
   I think that this small change should be done to avoid memleak
   and to make the code correct, what do you think?
