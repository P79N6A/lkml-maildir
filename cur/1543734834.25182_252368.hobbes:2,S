When I've done this I've started by taking big patch P against tree T,
finding the simplest, easiest to understand change in it, writing a
small patch P_0 which makes that one change, then diffing T + P against
	T + P_0
(where "T + P_0" means "the result of applying patch P_0 to tree T").
Repeat, write a second patch P_1, and diff T + P against
	T + P_0 + P_1
So at step n+1, I find out what's left to do by diffing T + P against
	T + P_0 + ... + P_n
(where I'm actually maintaining the patches P_i using Andrew Morton's
patch scripts).
Given a tree, a big patch, and a series of little patches (more
generally, given *two* series of patches) I'd like to be able to
calculate the diff between the two quickly.  Not having any automated
way to do that makes this all more of a pain than it should be.
It seems like it shouldn't be hard to do this with some shell scripting,
but I haven't sat down and tried it yet.  I'd be interested to hear if
anyone else as.
