Yes, if "source RPM" means files named like "kernel-$VERSION.src.rpm".
But we are talking[0] about a kernel-source-$VERSION.$ARCH.rpm's which
contain
the kernel sources (read: lots of .c and .h files, etc.) - including a
matching
.config and after `make oldconfig` - so that one can build out-of-tree
modules
after installing it with "KSRC=" (or whatever the Makefile parameter is
usually called).
And such kernel-source-$VERSION.$ARCH.rpm's may/will/should fall also
out
of a rebuild of a kernel-$VERSION.src.rpm.
