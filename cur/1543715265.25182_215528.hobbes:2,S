Hello,
I cannot run X.
after startx, I have this message in dmesg:
atkbd.c: unknown key released (transalted set 2, code 0x7a on 
isa00060/serio0).
atbkd.c: This is an XFree86 bug. It shouldn't access hardware directly.
Anyone knows if it is actually a XFree86 bug ?
And how to fix it ?
/var/log/XFree86.0.log gives me no error.
I've googled around and it seems that many people have this message, but 
they can start X. Not me !
Please help ! I need my gnome !
If it is not the right place to ask this question, please tell me where 
I can get more information.
Thanks
I'm using Debian Sid, kernel 2.6.4, XFree86 4.3.0-7
