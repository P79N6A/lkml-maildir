Subject: R52 hdaps support?

I recently splurged on a new ThinkPad R52 (because it was one of the few laptops 
in the store with /all/ linux-supported hardware), but the 2.6.14-rc1 kernel I 
just compiled says "hdaps: supported laptop not found".
Looking at the source I notice there's a whitelist of models that goes up to 
R51... How badly could it break if I just went ahead and added R52? Should it be 
"NORMAL" or "INVERT"?
