Not yet, Dmitry. I just managed to get today's -git compiled and running. I'll
give it a try tonite.
Moreover, I put a
	echo -n 0 > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serio0/resync_time
in my initscripts. Since then I didn't see any problem. I'll report later how it
went with that line removed and stock 2.6.16-rc1.
