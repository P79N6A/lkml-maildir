It's an issue of load, and both machines are running 'hot' so to speak.
When the loads on the machines climbs our update rsyncs take longer to
complete (considering that our loads are completely based on I/O this
isn't surprising).  More or less nothing has changed since:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/14/347
 with the exception that git & gitweb
are no longer the concern we have (the caching layer I put into
kernel.org seems to be taking care of the worst problems we were seeing
and I have a couple more to put up this weekend), right now it's getting
loads between the two machines load evened out and lowering the number
of allowed rsyncs on each machine to better bound the load problem.
