Neomagic 256AV.  I'll feed it the two disables the man page recommends and 
see if that makes the problem go away.  (I can trigger it almost at will by 
playing around with kmail with the threaded view of 2500+ linux-kernel 
messages and paging up and down really fast.  Or by switching the display 
when )
Kmail seems to be the only thing that actually triggers it.  I can't think of 
a lockup where kmail wasn't involved, but killing kmail (or the whole of kde) 
won't unfreeze the display and keyboard once it's borked, and when I ssh in 
and run top it's X that's got the cpu pegged at 99%, not any of the kde 
toys...
