Well, if there is a Linux Kool-Aid party, there won't be poisonings.  I
mean, any self-respecting Linux user would use real cyan (xsetroot -solid
cyan, then close all their windows?) rather than that cheap knock-off
"cyanide" (or skyblue or steelblue).
Kool-Aid sprayed on a monitor might result in electrocutions, though.
