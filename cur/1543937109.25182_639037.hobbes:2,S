It does not even compile for me, tested with 2.6.24-rc{7,8}. I will look at 
that later.
fs/built-in.o: In function `btrfs_xattr_set_acl':
acl.c:(.text+0x68f33): undefined reference to `posix_acl_from_xattr'
acl.c:(.text+0x68f47): undefined reference to `posix_acl_valid'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Is this release supposed to fix the suspend problem?
