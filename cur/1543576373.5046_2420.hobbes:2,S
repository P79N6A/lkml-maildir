Definitely?  Let's think about that.

Yes.  In other words, if we try to do O(1) LIFO, we can cause lost wakeups.

This enables wake_up_all().
Anyway, this is all just noise.
The key question is: which of the following do we want?
a) A simple, specific accept()-accelerator, and 2.2 remains without
   an exclusive wq API or
b) A general purpose exclusive wq mechanism which does not correctly
   support waiting on two queues simultaneuously where one is
   exclusive or
c) A general purpose exclusive wq mechanism which _does_ support it.
Each choice has merit!  You seem to want b).  davem wants c).
And given that 2.2 has maybe 2-4 years life left in it, I'd
agree with David.  Let's do it once and do it right while the issue
is fresh in our minds.
Yes?
