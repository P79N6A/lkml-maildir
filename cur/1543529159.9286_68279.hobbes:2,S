Its worth mentioning that MySQL uses a _really_ dumb locking strategy
which starves writers and causes db performance to suck really badly
when you have multiple concurrent readers and writers.  We used to see
it here, and it brings the machine to its knees.  To see if you're
hitting this, do "procinfo -d" and see if you're getting very large
numbers of context switches / sec.
If this is the case, its not a kernel issue, its a stupid app, and I
can give you a fairly crude workaround if you mail me in private.
