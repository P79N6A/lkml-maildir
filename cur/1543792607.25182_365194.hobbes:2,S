It isn't Linux kernel design. The Linux kernel emulates the Unix
architecture which, by definition, has the kernel performing tasks
on behalf of user programs. The kernel doesn't support the kernel!
It is designed to support user programs as efficiently as possible.
If you need a jpeg decoder, it is simply part of a user program,
hopefully shared with others as a runtime library. You just don't
put user stuff inside the kernel. It has no place there. Look at
Microsoft and see how they did things. They munged user-mode and
kernel stuff all into a slime-ball that gets linked together with
a database (the registry). That's why such systems perform poorly
and will never be reliable or secure.
If the techies (pronunced idiots) at Microsoft had left the Gordon
Bell kernel alone (he also designed VAX/VMS), and let it support
user-mode programs like it should, Linux probably would have died
out when Linus left Helsinki. Instead, people like you convinced
Microsoft that the "good stuff" should be inside the kernel.
People like Alan Cox are going to make sure that it doesn't
happen like that with Linux.

Again, learn about operating systems in general and what the
Unix/Linux platform is. These things didn't get rejected to user-land
they got put in user-land where they belong for the most efficient
operation.

No. We have a standard API that's well documented.
    Hint: struct file_operations
... for inside the kernel, and the usual open()/close()/read()/write()
/mmap()/poll()/ioctl() for the user-land interface. These are all
things that people who know about this architecture don't even have
to look up.

So fix the user-land tool and send a patch to the maintainer.

The proper solution is to learn what you are talking about,
then contribute something of value.
