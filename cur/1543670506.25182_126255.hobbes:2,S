Hi
As a Linux newbie, I have been trying to compile a new Linux kernel to give
me raid support.
This was easy the first time, but has failed the second time round, for a
reason I cannot understand.
Using the procedure:
bash# make mrproper
bash# make xconfig
< select all the options I want (including raid support) >
bash# make dep
bash# make clean
bash# make bzImage
The make fails, with the following errors:
In file included from console.c:110:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-27.7.x/include/linux/speakup.h:186:25: operator '('
has no left operand
make[3]: *** [console.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-27.7.x/drivers/char'
make[2]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[2]: Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-27.7.x/drivers/char'
make[1]: *** [_subdir_char] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-27.7.x/drivers'
make: *** [_dir_drivers] Error 2
As far as I can see, there is no reason for speakup.h to be included in the
make. However, since it is there, there is no reason for this error to
occur.
NOTE: The left bracket in the quotes is what is reported, although the
character in speakup.h is <.
speakup is specifically not requested in xconfig, as the vga console.
Please tell me what I have done wrong. As I said before, the previous
compilation went fine. Something has since broken.
Thanks in advance.
