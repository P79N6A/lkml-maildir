It's an issue if you want to do simple things, have the resources to
do simple things, but go over budget because the simple things are
built on top of complex things that you don't need. I see this crop
up frequently with IT infrastructures, where simple problems get
solved using completely unnecessary components just because those
components are available. If you want to maintain an SELinux policy
that looks like it does smackish things in addition to the reference
policy that's OK by me.
