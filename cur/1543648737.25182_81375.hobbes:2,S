I was afraid someone would be confused by the examples.  Davide loves
coroutines (check out 
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/nio-improve.html
 )
and I think his examples are written in that style.  He really means
what you think he should be meaning :-)
which is something like
     while (1) {
         grab next bunch of events from epoll
         for each event
             while (do_io(event->fd) != EAGAIN);
     }
I'm pretty sure.
