This is all information that libscg does not need to know. There are
only two models:
1. the old sg2 model before SG_IO was available, was to use write() and
read() on a /dev/sg* node.
2. the new sg3 model is do SG_IO on any device node no matter if /dev/hd,
/dev/sg or perhaps /dev/foobaz42 next year. /dev/sg* happened to be the
first to implement this, others followed suit, and more to come.
