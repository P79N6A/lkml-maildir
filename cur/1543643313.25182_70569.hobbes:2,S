Also note, it has been my experience that the blocks allocated to the file are
also lost. It takes a fsck operation to recover that.
I had a raided XFS filesystem that lost power at 3am every night... IRIX 
panic/crash/dead. After the third one in a row half of the raid volume was
missing. I noticed that when the aviailable space was exausted. It took an
xfs_repair to rebuild the free space. (power failure due to overloaded circuit
and somebody turned on a monitor...)
