I tend to agree on this one.
And on the transmit side if you have more than 1 pending TX frame, you
can always be prefetching the next one into the fifo so that by the
time the medium is ready all the checksum bits have been done.
In fact I'd be surprised if current generation 1g/10g cards are not
doing something like this.
