   Getting back the the mke2fs -m option. Wouldn't it be better to change the
   semantics of this option to specify the amount of blocks, MB or
   something instead of percentages?  1% of an 8GB filesystem is still 80 MB.
   I see no direct reason for a reserved area so big... 
There are two reasons why space is reserved in an ext2 filesystem.  The
first is as a "cushion" for root to be able to write log files, etc.
This is most important on /usr and/or /var partitions.  The second
reason is that ext2's fragmentation-avoidance algorithms work best when
there a certain amount of slack space reserved in the filesystem (i.e.,
we want to leave some amount of choice for the block allocation
algorithsm to choose optimal blocks to avoid fragmentation).  That's why
-m is represented as a percentage, and why 5% is used as the default.
