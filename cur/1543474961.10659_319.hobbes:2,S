If you mark the CVS files with `cvs admin -kb', then it won't mangle the
revision nmbers.
Personally I don't use CVS for the kernel tree because it's so slow.  I
maintain local patches, undo them before upgrading from Linus, then
reapply the patches.  I use `gendiff' to maintain the patches, and
meaningful backup file names.
