Ok, one concern was that in the cycle->interval conversion, some
interval lengths are not possible due to the clock's resolution.
In my mind, I'd like to provide a interval length to the NTP code and
have the NTP code provide an adjusted interval which can be used in
error accumulation and the resulting multiplier adjustment.
Or, we just write off the cycle->interval error as part of the clock's
natural error and let the NTP daemon compensate for it. Your thoughts?
Regardless, the point is that I'd prefer if the timeofday code to be
able to specify to the NTP code what the interval length is, rather then
the other way around. Does that sound reasonable?
thanks
