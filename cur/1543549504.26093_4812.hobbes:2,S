I disagree.
Yes, they have no _code_ in common. They have a completely distinct
history, and they have distinct users.
But they are, in the end, the same thing.  They are higher-level drivers
that do conceptually the same thing, namely manage the low-level drivers
as a potentially common resource. 
In fact, some of the MD and LVM code do the same things. 
CONFIG_MD_LINEAR and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LVM can be used to do the same thing
(and I think LVM can do striping too).  Yes, they have different
interfaces, but they have the same issues.
It makes sense to group them together. Neither is a true hardware
driver, and they have many common goals.
