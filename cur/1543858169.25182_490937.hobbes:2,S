Thanks... I was not aware of pci_mmap_page_range(), but that doesn't
seem to be quite the right interface.  It uses vma->vm_pgoff to say
what to remap.  A typical use for what I have in mind would be for a
userspace process to open a magic file and do mmap() at some
well-known offset (like 0), and have the kernel driver map the right
PCI registers into userspace, without userspace having to know what
offset to ask for.
This is especially important when the kernel has to handle picking a
"context" or "port" to avoid multiple userspace processes stepping on
each other.
And of course arch/i386/pci/i386.c has the following in its
pci_mmap_page_range() anyway:
	/* Write-combine setting is ignored, it is changed via the mtrr
	 * interfaces on this platform.
	 */
so the write_combine parameter is ignored...

It does seem somewhat hard to make sure there aren't multiple mappings
of the same thing, and I'm not sure it's worth trying to avoid it.  If
a device driver lets me mmap PCI memory with write-combining on, and
then (as root) I mmap raw PCI resources to get the same memory, whose
fault is it if things break?
I'm kind of an mm dummy but I don't even see a good way to avoid
multiple mappings like that.
