Andrew,
Here is the set of update patches that fixes, changes and documents
various issues in the new fd management patchset in -mm1. The
first patch - fix-dupfd-reacquire-fdt.patch fixes bugme #4770
and the oopses people other than me were seeing.
I have tested this patchset with 2.6.12-mm1 in my lab, not sure
if it means anything, given bugme #4770 and my userland :-)
Please include these in -mm1 for testing.
Thanks
Dipankar
