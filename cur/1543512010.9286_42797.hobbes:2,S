>Reasons against devfs:

Maybe we shouldn't have a ramdisk. This is not a design flaw.
Given, for some it is in fact a CON to consider, it isn't a
reason for exclusion.

Several being lack of persistence? Hard to check ramifications?
>- Impacts system administration, making device managing a lot less Unixy
When you say CONFIG_DEVFS, and for the most part, everything
is just the same.
>- Impacts _every_ single driver in the kernel, even if it isn't used
Only if you want devfs device nodes. You can put regular mknoded files in
a devfs.

No it can't. USB, PCMCIA, major/minor limitations, SCSI re-addressing
(sdc turning into sdb when sdb goes away), among others...
>Reasons for devfs:

Correction, makes it POSSIBLE.

Maintained by Richard Gooch, a highly compentent and willing
person who wants no more than to solve a problem. I may dislike
the way some were simply dismissing devfs as bad and simply
legislating that it is useless, and will react to this as I see
fit. Richard is always level headed, and will answer any questions
no matter how uninformed. I would have wanted to, but Horst did not
seem to want to listen.
