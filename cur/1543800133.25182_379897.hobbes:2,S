Hello,
  I am trying to determine which drivers and what hardware can be used to give reliable fsync
behavior.  I see many drivers with FIXME or TODO comments which make me nervous.
  I see the sd driver supports the direct SYNCHRONIZE_CACHE, but I'me having a hard time tracing
through how this translates to raid controllers and their drivers.
  Specificly, I am looking at the Adaptec RAID controllers and their i2o drivers.  I am told the
kernel's i2o driver lacks a strong guarantee on fsync, and so far am unable to determine if the
dpt_i2o driver also falls short in this reguard.
  I don't mean to start a 'drives lie - disable all caching, buy FC drives' flame war.  I know
drives can lie, but I'd like to know if the drivers are lying too.
thanks,
-Kenny
