Well, that was just an example...
But in real life I do use a static kobject in one case, so I'm very 
interested what should I do instead. I have a subsystem, and I want it 
to put all its stuff in a /sys/A directory. So I just define a static 
kobject for A and assign a dummy release function to it. Why is this bad?
And what should I do instead? kmalloc(sizeof(struct kobject), 
GFP_KERNEL) ? I do not have a dynamic structure corresponding to my 
module. I have many data structures corresponding to entities my object 
handles and I have one static array which refers them. All is simple. I 
do not want to introduce a dynamic data structure corresponding to the 
subsystem as a whole just in order to not use static kobjects.
Comments?
