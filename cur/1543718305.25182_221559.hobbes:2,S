The specification you refer to consists of 4 sentences.  One
of them was normative.  The main goal is to communicate to
linux vendors and silicon vendors that CE companies are
interested in correct support of this option.  For the
platforms and code where this is not the default now, there
is a risk that -Os bugs might cause problems.

Verifying that something is supported correctly on multiple
architectures is not simple.  Yes, we know that the default
optimization level for ARM is -Os.  As recently as last month,
there was a problem report about -Os on the gcc mailing list.
I fail to see what it is about our communication (that we'd like
to see all platforms support -Os) that you find so offensive.
