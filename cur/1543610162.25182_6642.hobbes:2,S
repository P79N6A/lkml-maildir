That is unfortunate, since a lot of things changed in 2.4.10, so it will
make tracking the change hard.  Yet, I am running 2.4.13 and have no such
problems (well, at least I think not).  I don't have a spare partition >
2GB, but I can do the following without problems, which _should_ be the
same thing:
dd if=/dev/vgtest/lv of=/dev/vgtest/lv bs=4k skip=1100k seek=1100k count=1
(i.e. it reads a block and writes a block from > 4GB offset in the file,
and I can do this when logged in as a non-root user, which has write
access to the disk, and also when su'd to root, just in case).
Can you try the above test, just to confirm that it is equivalent to your
mkfs test?
Cheers, Andreas
