Well, because that's not actually very useful functionality, and likely 
makes software that seems "obviously" correct wrt the PCI spec break.

Yeah, that's another option.  Would just mean an additional conditional 
in the mmconfig code, I'll give it a try...
Apparently Vista will move away from using type 1 config space accesses 
though, so if we keep using it, we'll probably run into some lame board 
that assumes you're using mmconfig at some point in the near future.  
But then again, we're often on that less tested path (e.g. with ACPI), 
so maybe that doesn't matter much.
