Grumble. The options are:
a) export it in the kernel's native size and have userspace figure it
out
b) add a header
c) lie to 32-bit apps on 64-bit kernels
d) always export 32 bits
e) always export 64 bits
I started with (a), switched to (b), and then Alan and Dave convinced
me to switch back to (a). I don't think (c) is desireable, especially
as it means having two code paths. (d) would work until memory got
large enough that PFNs didn't fit in 32 bits. (e) would be ok all
around, except for the extra overhead. Ho hum.
