Just to confirm something that I wrote in the post-halloween-2.5 doc,
that doesn't tally with this..
- The size and alignment of O_DIRECT file IO requests now matches that
  of the device, not the filesystem.  Typically this means that
  you can perform O_DIRECT IO with 512-byte granularity rather than 4k.
Is this a case of the man pages not following 2.5 yet, or is this
incorrect ?
