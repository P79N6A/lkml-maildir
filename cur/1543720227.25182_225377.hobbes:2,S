Booting 2.6.7-rc1 with the de2104x driver built-in and eth0
disconnected from the LAN leads to the following oops about
a second after INIT tried to ifup eth0:
eth0: timeout expired stopping DMA
kernel BUG in de_set_media at drivers/net/tulip/de2104x.c:919!
<register dump omitted>
Call trace:
de21041_media_timer
run_timer_softirq
__do_softirq
do_softirq
timer_interrupt
ret_from_except
ppc6xx_idle
cpu_idle
rest_init
start_kernel
The PowerPC kernel decides to panic() after a brief delay
at this point, so I can't capture the oops text except by
typing it down manually. Besides, I doubt the ppc register
dump would be useful; we know which BUG() was hit.
