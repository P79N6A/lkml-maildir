Then you have a bad disk, period. If the disks always tries to
approximate SPTF internally, then it's a bad design. Apparently that
Other OS times read/write requests out after 3 seconds, we we at least
know we are getting service in that time frame. Not saying that is good
enough, just a data point.
But the situation you describe above can easily be fixed, you described
the solution yourself in the previous mail. The silly tag depth is a
problem in itself, it should not be done. Keeping a sane number of tags
just to keep the disk busy, and we can use the "don't queue more
requests before X finishes, because X has been waiting for Y ms" tactic.
In fact, considering folks want to make error handling for command
timeouts a block property (that I agree with, we are already going there
with the SG_IO stuff), we can soft timeout a command if need be and
handle the case from there. What do you think?

I think it does, to some extent at least.

Well, it doesn't...
