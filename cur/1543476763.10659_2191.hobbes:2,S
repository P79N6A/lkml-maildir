There is still a problem for values of timeout a little larger than
((unsigned long)-1 / HZ).  eg. for HZ==100, a timeout of 42949673 gets
turned into a timeout of 2.
better is something like
	if ((unsigned long)timeout > (unsigned long)-999 / HZ)
		timeout = MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT;
	else if (timeout)
		timeout = (timeout*HZ+999)/1000+1;
