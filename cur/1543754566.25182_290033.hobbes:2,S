my intention was to let 'limit 0' mean 'old RT semantics' - i.e. 'no RT
CPU time for unprivileged tasks at all', and only privileged tasks may
do it and then they'll get full CPU time with no throttling.
so in that context your observation highlights another bug, which i
fixed in the -D7 patch available from the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/rt-limit-patches/
not doing the '0' exception would make it harder to introduce the rlimit
in a compatible fashion. (My current thinking is that the default RT_CPU
rlimit should be 0.)
