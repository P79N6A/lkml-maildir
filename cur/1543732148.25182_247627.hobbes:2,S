The most crucial issue for larger systems is removing the rather easily
triggerable rwlock starvation. Perhaps dipankar's /proc/ -only tasklist
RCU patch can resolve that.

With this in hand we can probably ignore the /proc/ -related efficiency
issues in favor of any method preventing the rwlock starvation, e.g.
dipankar's /proc/ -only tasklist RCU patch.
