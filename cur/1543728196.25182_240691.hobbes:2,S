Unfortunately most of the remaining BKL uses seem to be very subtle.
Removing lock_kernel() correctly requires a deep understanding of the
global locking semantics and may be very invasive.  In the end it's
also hard to be sure bugs haven't been introduced.

Fixing up a filesystem's write locking doesn't sound like a very good
newbie project to me.
