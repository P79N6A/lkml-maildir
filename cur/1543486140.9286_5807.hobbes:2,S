Hello everyone ...
Starting with MINIX version 1.7.0, primary MINIX partitions can be
subpartitioned, using a regular (DOS style) second-level partition table.
This patch makes these subpartitions visible to Linux version 2.2.1.
I've tested it locally with several good and bad MINIX subpartition tables.
Any feedback appreciated!
The patch includes patches for fs/Config.in and
Documentation/Configure.help. I'm new at this (following the FAQ along), and
I don't know if I was supposed to do this, but it seemed logical. The
feature is enabled through CONFIG_MINIX_PARTITION, which is "hidden" behind
the CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL switch.
Also, I *am* currently subscribed to the list, but CCs or replies directly
to my email adress would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance for any
feedback.
Regards, Rene
