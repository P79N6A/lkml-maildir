Now that you mention it, just locking out create and rename during directory 
traversal would eliminate the pain.  Delete is easy enough to handle during 
traversal.  For a B-Tree, coalescing could simply be deferred until the 
traversal is finished, so reading the directory in physical storage order 
would be fine.  Way, way cleaner than what we have to do now.
