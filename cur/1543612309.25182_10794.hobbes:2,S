Nooooo!!!!!
Don't break stuff by adding headers. There is already a version
in the file. It's in decimal, which sucks, but this will find it:
grep ' Version_' System.map
Adding a random 128-bit ID might be nice, as long as it's done
in the same sort of way and is available via /proc. Something
like this would do:  kern_128_id_UkZd1JLdOvAsALfFEL1UI
