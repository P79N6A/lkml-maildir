Subject: [stable] Wanted: Allow adding new device IDs during the -stable cycle
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'd like to propose we allow adding new device IDs as part
of the -stable process, but only under certain conditions:
1) Each device (or group of devices) gets added as a separate
   patch, i.e. we don't just diff the device tables. This way
   each original patch that added the device(s) upstream will
   be become a single patch for -stable.
2) Devices that require new features/capabilities in their
   driver won't be added.
Candidate patches would be something like these, which together
add support for the ATI SB700 ATA controller:
1)
http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=823777181b4c0200923dcb026efa5b37f55c0ecf
Adds ATI sb700 quirk, using exactly the same one as sb600.
2)
http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=2bcfdde6767f2f07891d2753c25220012fe5e6d2
Adds the new device to the existing driver's device ID table.
