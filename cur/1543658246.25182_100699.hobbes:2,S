Subject: RE: [PATCH][2.4] generic cluster APIC support for systems with
m ore than 8 CPUs
If you're interested in working on it, I'm very happy to test it ...
(should probably be kept seperate from your other stuff though).
I'll see if I can find someone in our performance team to evaluate 
how your existing patch runs on SMP for us ...

Hi Martin,
  Would somebody get a chance to try the kirq patch out? If yes, please
let me know, how the patch did on your systems. Did your guys find any
issues with it? I will also appreciate more comments.
Thanks & Regards,
Nitin
