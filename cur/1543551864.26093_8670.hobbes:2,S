In case this ever gets done, please remember to fix ide-tape, which is
quite broken with the latest ide patches.  Only work around I know of
is to run ide tapes using ide-scsi emulation.  The issue, I believe,
is failure to pad data to tape block size as necessary.  There was an
earlier thread on this.
Take care,
