Subject: [PATCH 103/196] driver core: clean up device_shutdown
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/25/145

device_shutdown does not need to be in a separate file.  Move it into
the driver core file where it belongs.
This also moves us one more step closer to making devices_kset static,
now only the crazy sysdevs are keeping that from happening...
