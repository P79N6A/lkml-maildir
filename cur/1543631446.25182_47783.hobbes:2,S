BTW, I have a particular setup that spits out such errors,
and I somehow thinks the cable is good.
I have IBM DTLA-307030 drive and Seagate Barracuda IV drive (last one purchased
only recently).
IBM drive is connected to far end of 80-wires IDE cable and Barracuda is
connected to the middle of this same wire.
Before I bought IBM drive, everything was ok.
But now I see BadCRC errors on hdb (only on hdb, which is barracuda drive)
usually when both drives are active.
If I disable DMA on IBM drive (or if kernel disables it by itself for some
reason, and it actually does it sometimes), these errors seems to go away.
This is all on 2.4.18, but actually I think this is irrelevant.
If that's a bad cable, why it is only happens when both drives are working
in DMA mode?
Thank you.
Bye,
    Oleg
