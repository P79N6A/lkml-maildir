Most utilities do not expect to be oom-killed, but they do not
expect to be killed by segfault because of stack shortage either.
So avoiding the oom-kill and getting segfaults is no improvement
in my eyes.
A few days ago I remarked that 2 is no good when there is no swap.
OK. So, more modest aim - tighten things only in case there is
plenty of swap. I like to return NULL for malloc(), that is
something a good program tests for. I hate to fail a stack grow.
So, must play a bit more, see whether I can find a mode much
stricter than 0 that is still suitable as a general working
environment for everybody.
