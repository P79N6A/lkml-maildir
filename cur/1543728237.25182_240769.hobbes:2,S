Results with CONFIG_M586TSC are basically the same as CONFIG_MCYRIXIII. 
I have posted my latest results here:
http://www.members.dca.net/rlrevell/testresults/testresults.html
There are graphs (linear and logarithmic scale) for each of 5 trials,
followed by all the XRUN traces and preempt violations I got around the

iozone -a was running also.
