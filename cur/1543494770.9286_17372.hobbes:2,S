I'm reading the ANSI C standard.  The language in the standard is 
quite clear.  This is not my personal opinion; it is my
experience with how C actually works.

lint is not a compiler.  What it calls an error is stylistic, not 
semantic.  lint will complain about a lot of things that are
legal C but stylistically undesirable.  Look:
---dumbass.c---
#include <stdio.h>
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
int main()
#include <stdio.h>
int foo()
{
    return 0;
}
int main()
{
 int i;
 if(i=foo())
     (void)puts("If this is not seen, it is a compiler BUG!");
 else
     (void)puts("Richard Johnson is a dumbass");
 return 0;
}
---dumbass.c---
Digital UNIX 4.0E cc $ cc dumbass.c
Digital UNIX 4.0E cc $ ./a.out
Richard Johnson is a dumbass
Solaris 2.6 Sun C 4.0 $ cc dumbass.c
Solaris 2.6 Sun C 4.0 $ ./a.out
Richard Johnson is a dumbass
Linux 2.2.7 gcc 2.7.2.3 $ cc dumbass.c
Linux 2.2.7 gcc 2.7.2.3 $ ./a.out
Richard Johnson is a dumbass
The two non-gcc compilers agree happily with both gcc and the
ANSI C standard as quoted above.
You seem to be the one who won't let the facts get in the way of
your opinions.  In the future I suggest that you be a little more 
careful about presenting your untested opinions as facts,
especially when it is so easy to prove you wrong.
