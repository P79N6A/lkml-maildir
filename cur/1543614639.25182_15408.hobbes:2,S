I think Keith wanted a very small time window tho (~24 hrs, barring big
supprises).  But if we're going to be worried about the build time,
kbuild-2.5 and cml2 aren't co-dependant, yes?  I know kbuild-2.5 works
w/o cml2, and last I tried (ages ago admitedly) cml2 didn't need
kbuild-2.5.  So we could, in theory dump cml1 quickly but leave the old
Makefiles for a bit longer.  Or if Keith thinks he can start on the
speed problems soon, just plod along for a few releases. :)
