Prior to Linus' 2.4.5 release, aic7xxx version 6.1.5 was embedded
in the kernel.  Although corrected almost immediately after its release,
this version attempted to build the firmware at all times.  Although
a lofty goal from an aesthetic standpoint (why should you have generated
files when you have all the source to build them?), it simply doesn't
work on the miriad of distributions out there.   It took a while
for Linus to pick up the change that added the "rebuild firmware"
config option, so you may have a kernel that still has this broken
behavior.  Updates to most recent kernels to the latest aic7xxx driver
can be found here:

You could always choose to use the older aic7xxx driver.  To this day,
it is still available in the 2.4.X kernels.  I don't have enough details
about your particular problems to know if this will help your situation.

Perhaps I've missed the reports then.  I've made every effort to repond
to the reports that I've seen, have worked to correct those issues,
and expect to release 6.1.14 early next week.  Unfortunately even
working for Adaptec, our testing resources (number/type of machines)
are limited, so there will always be some bugs left for the userbase
to find.

Can you provide information about your system and how it fails?  I will
need to know driver revision, type of card, and any messages you can
copy down during a failure with "aic7xxx=verbose" set either in LILO
for a statically compiled driver or used when loading the module.  A
dmesg from a system booted with the 2.2 kernel should give me most of
the system information I need.
