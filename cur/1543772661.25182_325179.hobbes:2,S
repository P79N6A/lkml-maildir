Does some clueless user who needs a custom kernel for something even
understand what you just said?  Probably not...

Its big, but not as big as some I've worked on.  I'm willing to tune the
"arch" specific stuff where I can do better than the compiler.  A few bytes
here, a few there, pretty soon you got a page back.  BTW, there's just under
100K of fluff zero padding in locked pages because of the way kernel
messages are being 32 byte aligned.  Do you think getting 100K of locked
kernel memory back essentially "for free" is worth taking a shot at?  I do.

Pretty harsh attitude IMO.  People use compilers because they DO want
someone to take care of some things for them.
