Are you serious?  What kind of application are you running?

OK, well hmm, then in 1969 we needed a volume size of 4K.  Um, it's 
probably more accurate to use 18 months as the doubling period.
Anyway, that's what the 64 bit option for buffer_head->b_blocknr is 
supposed to handle.  The question is, is it necessary to go to a 
uniform 64 bit quantity for all users regardless of whether they feel 
restricted by a 32 TB volume size limit or not.
/me figures it will be 9 years before he even has a 1 TB disk in his 
laptop
OK, I looked again and saw the smiley.  Sometimes it's hard to tell 
what's outrageous when talking about disk sizes.
