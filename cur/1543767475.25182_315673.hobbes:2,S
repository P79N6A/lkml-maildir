At this level of performance I would say it doesn't matter. If a full 
checkin take two minutes or three minutes doesn't concern me, because 
I'm not going to sit and watch it, I'm going to read LKML or write my 
beer blog in another window. I would care about two vs. three hours, but 
minutes are too long to wait and too short to care.
Now look at pulling 41MB over a T1 link. All of a sudden I care bigtime! 
I want very much to use my bandwidth for other things, I don't want 41MB 
added to my backup, etc. Disk space is cheap, but unless you ignore 
backups and have an OC3 or so, these numbers are large enough to be 
irritating. Not a huge issue, just one of those "piss me off every time 
I do it" things.
If there is a functional reason to use git, something Mercurial doesn't 
do, then developers will and should use git. But the associated hassles 
with large change size, rather than the absolute size, are worth 
considering.
