Looks like IRQ problem. Can you see IRQ handler being called?
I.e. doesn the counter in /proc/interrupts increment?

It should be, though I haven't used N2 card for a year maybe.
Still, other cards (c101 and pci200syn) share the same low-level
driver core, I know people with c101 (not sure about their kernel
versions) and I personally use pci200syn with latest 2.6 kernels.
There are some issues wrt Frame-Relay code (no PVC list locking,
there is some small possibility of kernel panic etc. while removing
a PVC on live interface - will fix when time permits, problem never
reported).
