the good news is that userspace applications are not kernel version
specific! At least in general; there are some low level system tools
that sometimes are impacted (these are usually the "kernel helpers" like
the insmod tool or udev). Regular applications work on just about any
kernel; applications written for linux in 1994 still work on 2.6
kernels!
