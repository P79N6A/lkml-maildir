The word "GCC bugs" is a bit hard for them.
gcc gives different warnings for code where it could prove that a 
variable gets used uninitialized and code where it's not sure whether a 
variable will always be used initialized.
There are even cases where it's technically impossible for gcc to 
determine that a variable always gets initialized.
And these "might be used uninitialized" warnings have already found 
several kernel bugs.
