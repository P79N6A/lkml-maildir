I think (see below) that it does not apply only to threaded apps. But
it would need one of SMP or PREEMPT to trigger.

Sure. But I think the race exists... I'll try spelling it out in
the conventional way:
try_to_free_buffers()
   drop_buffers() (succeeds)
** preempt here or run right-hand thread on 2nd CPU in SMP **
                                do_no_page()
                                  set_page_dirty()
                                [now modify the page via this mapping
                                (from this process or a concurrent thread)]
   clear_page_dirty() (clears PG_dirty + pte dirty, oops)
