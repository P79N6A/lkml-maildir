Looks like the fan entries are being commanded pretty much full out.. 
(I'm sure those don't all correspond to physical fans, but likely 
different fan speeds.) Are you sure there's not a hardware problem (one 
or more fans not working, vents/heatsink clogged with dust)? Your system 
seems to be running very hot.
