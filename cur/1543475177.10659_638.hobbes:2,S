I believe this.  I have been encouraging the official mirrors to use
rsync rather than FTP, which tends to be more resistant to these kinds
of problems.

That is because gzip wasn't around back then.  ftp.kernel.org doesn't
use any compressor per se, although there is a script around which
converts .gz -> .bz2 automagically.  .Z files aren't seen by this
script.
