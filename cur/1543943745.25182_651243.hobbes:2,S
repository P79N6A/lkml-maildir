Well, it seems that it does have a positive effect for the 'konqueror hangs' 
case, but doesn't improve the db case.
This shouldn't be surprising, as the db redundant writeout problem is 
localized not in fsync but rather in ext3_ordered_write_end.
Maybe some form of a staged merged commit could help.
