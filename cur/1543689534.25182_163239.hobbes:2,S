At first I disagreed with your patch.  I was thinking that special
alignment is only really needed to avoid aliasing problems for
_writable_ shared mappings, and VM_SHARED is right for that.  (Which
would indicate that mmap is faulty, not mremap).
But after some thought, I agree with you.
A read-only mapping of a shared segment must be coherent with other,
possibly writable mappings, so far as the architecture can guarantee
that.
That coherence should not disappear if the file handle used for the
mapping was opened O_RDONLY.
One last thought: this is what PROT_SEM is for.  Linux doesn't use
this in any useful way.  But, technically, mmap with MAP_SHARED ad
PROT_SEM should enable cache coherence, and that might include
aligning the address.  Without PROT_SEM an application should not rely
on cache coherence.
