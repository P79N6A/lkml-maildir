Hello,
While trying to use initrds with the 2.6.0-test3 kernel,
I found out that ramdisk support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM) is allowed to be
modular, while at the same time initrd support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD) can be
compiled into the kernel:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD=y
This does not make sense, however, as no initial ramdisk can be loaded
while the generic ramdisk driver is outside the static kernel part!
Consequently, I promptly fell for it, though I agree that it should have
come to my mind before actually compiling the kernel!
In 2.4 kernels, the configuration logic does not allow that.
Regards
Oliver
