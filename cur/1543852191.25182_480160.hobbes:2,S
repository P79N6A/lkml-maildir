+EXPORT_SYMBOL(request_gpio);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(free_gpio);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(gpio_set_value);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(gpio_get_value);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(gpio_set_output_enable);
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(gpio_set_pullup_enable);
I wonder about this naming choice.  I'd have though that if/when the kernel
gets a generic GPIO driver or layer, these avr32-specific symbols will need
renaming.
h8300 uses h8300_free_gpio(), and there's also omap_free_gpio().  Perhaps
this patch should have added avr32_free_gpio()?
