This the the first time i use CFS with without X auto-renicing and i think its 
not smooth as before :(
While compiling something (say alsa-drivers) with just "make" firefox starts 
to scrolls slowly, kmail frezes time to time, applications are not responsive 
as before in that load and also system is not as fast as before while system 
idle. Also somehow boot takes longer;
v6;
Apr 28 16:40:41 (up 10.57) /sbin/mudur.py sysinit
Apr 28 13:40:49 (up 17.75) /sbin/mudur.py boot
Apr 28 13:41:00 (up 28.61) /sbin/mudur.py default
v7;
Apr 29 00:35:49 (up 10.61) /sbin/mudur.py sysinit
Apr 28 21:36:14 (up 33.77) /sbin/mudur.py boot
Apr 28 21:36:16 (up 36.21) /sbin/mudur.py default
And i while trying to understand what caused this (or trying to confirm X is 
the problem), i realized Xorg is not the only reniced process in v6

Until now i didn't try to renice X manually to see if it changes anything in 
v7 but i will (ırgh, i simply boot with v6).

If you want some more output/info etc. please just say, i have both v6 and v7 
available.
