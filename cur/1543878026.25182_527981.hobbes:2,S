Hmm, I saw an improvement, but that was just on a raw syscall test
with a single page chunk. Real-world use I guess will get progressively
less dramatic as other overheads start being introduced.
Multi-thread performance probably won't get a whole lot better (it does
eliminate 1 down_write(mmap_sem), but one remains) until you use my
madvise patch.

Sure, yes. And I guess you'd always want to keep that options around as
a debugging aid.
