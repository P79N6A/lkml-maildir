Only, it's a different view of the same tree.  That may not matter 
performance-wise, though.
Also, for performance-critical applications, the /meta tree is pretty 
easy -- it becomes more like /meta/inode/some_inode_number/.
There's also the chroot issue, though.

So, will the format change happen at mount time?  Will it need a special 
mount flag?  Will I need to use debugfs or some other offline tool?
