Hi all + Greg,
I have a laptop with a "USB Socking station" attached (basically a 
hub+serial+paralel.).
I have managed to use the Serial ONCE to sync my PalmPilot, out of at 
least 60 attempts. 2-3 of these attempts ended in an OOPS, and here it 
is in a neat "tar cvzf" format. The only caveat is that is went through 
an "apm -s" cycle between the oops and the report.
HELP!
Please repond to "sam -=- AT -=- freed -=-= DOT -=-= net"
Sam.
