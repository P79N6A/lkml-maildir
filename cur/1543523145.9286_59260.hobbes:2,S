Thanks to everyone who answered.  I'll fess up as to the reason I asked such a
banal question in the first place:  Linuxnewbie.org has a contest:  Post the
date the kernel will be released, and win a t-shirt.  :-)  The site owner,
Sensei said that the date had in fact been determined.  If that's so...  :-)
Well, I'll just have to buy a t-shirt I guess.  Thanks anyway!  :-)

| Yes and no. Yes: some peoples named such "release dates". No: it was not
| kernel developers and thus such dates are meaningless.

| Perhaps. You can even write such date yourself :-) With more or less the
same
