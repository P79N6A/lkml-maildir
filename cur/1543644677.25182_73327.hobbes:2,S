Currently we can't, you're right. But I've already detailed how to do
this in a paper I wrote last july on how to obtain Linux SMP clusters
with as few modifications to the kernel as possible. The paper is
available on the web:
http://opersys.com/ftp/pub/Adeos/practical-smp-clusters.ps
(If you stil can't access the web as said in the other email, I can
send you a copy off-list if you want.)

Certainly. According to some reports it's already used in some commercial
systems and, as today's RTAI announcement reads, it will be the basis
for the next release of RTAI.
What we need now is ports to other architectures than the i386. This
should be fairly simple for anyone familiar enough with the Linux
interrupt layer for any other arch.
