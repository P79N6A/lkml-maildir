Yes, never mind, misread.

Settable through BIOS perhaps? But anyways, if it used to work, it should 
work and I really suspect it's just a matter of a  broken OSS emulation on 
alpha anyways. In fact, I fairly distinctly remember this being an issue not 
too long ago but google is coming up empty...
Takashi? Wasn't there an OSS emulation on Alpha thing a while ago?

That's an expected string and very likely doesn't mean you have a 0.9.0-rc4 
alsa-lib installed. "strings [ ... ] | grep ^ALSA_" probably shows a few 
later versions as well. But if the problem's the (kernel) OSS emulation then 
userspace dopesn't matter anyway.
You seem to have sox installed, so try
$ sox foo.wav -t alsa default
and
$ sox foo.wav -t ossdsp /dev/dsp
to have it play through the ALSA and OSS interfaces, respectively.
Rene.
