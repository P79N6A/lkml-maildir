I managed to read several of your warnings about using autofs for media 
without coming across an explanation of why.  I just assumed that as 
maintainer, you had good reasons to do so.  I more-or-less agree with you 
about the desirability of insert and removal detection.  I'm not sure if it 
could ever be made to work for floppies, but there is no reason why one 
solution should fit all cases.  If there were common ioctls which could check 
the insertion and removal status of the various drives, I might have taken 
that approach.  
I wanted to get the same functionality as supermount without the instability, 
and as far as I can tell, I have succeeded.  It's not ideal, but it works for 
me, and hopefully will work for others as well until something better is 
produced.
