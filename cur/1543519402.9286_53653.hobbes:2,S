Hi,
I ran into the same thing.  I got it working, but :)) have no idea
why it works.  Don't do this unless you like to tinker and don't mind
the occasional mushroom cloud.
What I did <cringe> is first, comment out the message.  That is only
important after the box actually mounts an fs, but then it gets VERY
noisy.  Secondly, I copied make_request() to a new function I called
make_request_redirect() [for some pretty foggy reasons].  Thirdly, I
changed md_make_request() to use make_request_redirect().. same in
raid1.c.  This works just fine, (tested raid0 and 1over0) but looks
dainbramaged as all hell.
The only thing different in make_request_redirect() is the 'r'..
	q = get_queue(bh->b_rdev);
I shouldn't post this, but I'm curious enough to take a toasting :)
	-Mike
