Can you provide a few more details about the configuration?
o kernel version
o architecture (i386 or x86-64)
o post the full console output from power up?
Recent email on linux-pci raised awareness that 32-bit kernel
can not support 64-bit PCI MMIO addresses. struct resource (defined in
include/linux/ioport.h) defines the start/end field as "unsigned long".
That's only 32-bit on i386 kernels.

I have to wonder if those BARs are truly prefetchable.
Does Mellanox assume CPU is the only one to write the 3rd BAR (RAM)
and the CPU implements a write-through cache (vs write back)?
I'm just guessing because I don't understand exactly how the
256MB of onboard RAM is accessed.

And I have to wonder if those BARs truly are prefetchable.
It would imply only the CPU writes them and
