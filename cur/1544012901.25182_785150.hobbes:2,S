Although I agree that any additional allocation is something, which 
should be avoided, *if possible*. But you shouldn't overestimate the 
overhead of the sk_transaction_token allocation in cases, when it would 
be needed. At first, sk_transaction_token is quite small, so a single 
page in the kmem cache would keep about 100 of them, hence the slow 
allocation path would be called only once per 100 objects. Second, in 
many cases ->sendpages() needs to allocate a new skb, so already there 
is at least one such allocations on the fast path.
Actually, it doesn't look like the skb shared info destructor alone 
can't solve the task we are solving, because we need to know not when an 
skb transmittion finished, but when transmittion of our *set of pages* 
finished. Hence, with skb shared info destructor we would need also to 
invent some way to track set of pages <-> set of skbs translation (you 
refer it as combining tag and separate destructor), which would bring 
this solution on the entire new complexity level for no gain over the 
sk_transaction_token solution.
Thanks,
