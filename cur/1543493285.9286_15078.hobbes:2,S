Hi -
I'm running a recent (2.2.5) Linux kernel, netbooting on a diskless
SPARC.  I'm using NFS root, and get this message (from
net/sunrpc/sched.c) shortly after mounting the root fs:
	rpciod: active tasks at shutdown?!
Furthermore, when this message prints, it looks like rpciod_users is 1,
even though the code looks to me like it should never reach this point
unless rpciod_users becomes 0.
And, of course, if I turn on all the RPC/NFS debugging flags,
everything works fine, suggesting some kind of race condition,
possibly to due with the semaphore code, but that's just a guess.
Has anybody seen anything like this?  Your input would be welcome.
