This test is a little intentional.
(Normal I/O may fail, but journal commit I/O doesn't fail)
If you want to do this, you could put journal on the other device.

The only problem about this is, the users who set reject address range really
don't want to insert failures from the address range. So they have to change
stacktrace-depth large enough. It will cause large slow down by aggressive
stacktrace and there is no guarantee to prevent from injecting failures the
address range.
