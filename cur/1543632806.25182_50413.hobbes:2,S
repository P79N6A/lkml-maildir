I plan to port this driver next over to the new api. I planned on doing it
today except Linus BK tree will not compile right now :-( I get a
/usr/include/asm/eerno.h:4: asm-generic/errno.h: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [split-include] Error 1
Once this is fixed I will get to fixing the NVIDIA fbdev driver.
