And it doesn't make sense there either.
Well.  There are situations where it makes a _bit_ of sense: in those
places where we are trying to determine whether a piece of memory is still
in the CPU's cache.  If we assume that the CPU is evicting cachelines at a
constant lines/sec rate then yes, using walltime has some correlation with
reality.
But in this application which you are proposing, any correlation with
elapsed walltime is very slight.  It's just the wrong baseline to use. 
What is the *sense* in it?

Yes.  And it is wrong to do so.  Because a node may well have no "free"
pages but plenty of completely stale ones which should be reclaimed.
This patch is very specific to the one particular usage scenario which your
users happen to deploy but is quite ineffective for other (and quite valid)
usage scenarios.

Reclaim isn't expensive.
