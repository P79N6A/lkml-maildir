I guess so. Is plugging still needed now that the IO layer should
get larger requests? Disabling it might result in a small initial
request (although even that may be good for pipelining)...
Otherwise, we could make set_page_dirty_lock use a weird non-unplugging
variant (although maybe that will upset Ken), but I'd rather look
at simplification first ;)

sync_page wants to get either the current mapping, or a NULL one.
The sync_page methods must then be able to handle running into a
NULL mapping.
With splice, the mapping can change, so you can have the wrong
sync_page callback run against the page.

The ->pin() calls in pipe_to_file and pipe_to_sendpage?

But the vma isn't going to disappear because mmap_sem is held; and the
vma should hold a ref on the inode I think?

Am I wrong about mmap_sem?
Anyway, it is possible that most of the problems could be solved by locking
the page at the time of lookup, and unlocking it on completion/dirtying...
it's just that that would be a bit of a task. Can we somehow add BUG_ONs to
lock_page to ensure we've got an inode ref?
