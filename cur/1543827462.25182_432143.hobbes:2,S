but "supporting existing kernel coding style as-is" is not a must-have 
criterium for inclusion. While preserving semantics is strongly 
encouraged of course, a patch can change semantics (or can introduce 
restrictions) as long as it's common-sense or there is no other way out. 
The question is benefit vs. disadvantage, not a rigid "does it change 
semantics" rule.
Just look at Sparse annotations: they add maintainance overhead, but the 
overhead is well worth the trouble: they avoid bugs and they also serve 
as documentation/specification. And Sparse annotations are alot more 
numerous than kmemleak annotations will ever be!

there's no good way around this one but to annotate it in one way or 
another.
We could express the non-leak nature of this allocation in a cleaner way 
by introducing the following API:
	memleak_boot_time_alloc(res);
Here kmemleak should build a global list of such allocations, with the 
following rules: these allocations must not be freed after that point, 
but these allocations will be searched for further pointers.
Via this method we will both document the special nature of these 
allocations and we'll enforce that it's not freed. (not that there is a 
high likelyhood of freeing a buffer whose pointer nobody knows - the 
purpose is rather to make sure that the annotation is correct)

yes.
my "document the exceptions" request was to make sure that such special 
rules are not forgotten. As long as they are documented clearly, if 
there's some common pattern between a number of them then they can be 
moved into the kmemleak infrastructure, to further reduce the annotation 
overhead.
