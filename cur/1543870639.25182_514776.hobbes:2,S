That's a disturbing remark.  Under precisely what NOMMU conditions?
I had thought Robin's suggestion very sensible; and throughout mm/
it has seemed pretty random whether we pass an "mm" argument down
in addition to "vma", or just take vma->vm_mm at whatever level needs.
You seem to be suggesting vma->vm_mm is dangerous when CONFIG_NOMMU,
but we MMU people are scarily unaware of that.  Perhaps you need to
put #ifndef CONFIG_NOMMU around vm_mm in struct vm_area_struct?
Or am I totally misunderstanding?
