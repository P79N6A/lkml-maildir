I have no problem keeping PG_reserved for that, and _ONLY_ for that.
(though i'd rather see it renamed then). I'm just afraid by doing so,
some drivers will jump in the gap and abuse it again... Also, we should
make sure we kill the "trick" of refcounting only in one direction.
Either we refcount both (but do nothing, or maybe just BUG_ON if the
page is "reserved" -> not valid RAM), or we don't refcount at all.
For things like Cell, We'll really end up needing struct page covering
the SPUs for example. That is not valid RAM, shouldn't be refcounted,
but we need to be able to have nopage() returning these etc...
