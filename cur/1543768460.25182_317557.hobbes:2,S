That sounds an awful lot like you want to make changes to the current
support in the kernel.

IMHO part of the reason its so poorly understood is that people aren't
using it.  That's why I suggest we use some of the proposed patches
which open up name space operations to common users.  There are some
security checks (like the one brought up justifying the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
permissions on CLONE_NS) that need to be added, before we start
removing others -- and I'm quite concerned that Viro hasn't weighed in
on any of these new patches, I wonder if its because this thread seems
to have gone off the deep end.
