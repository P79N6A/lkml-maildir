	I don't understand, what's the difference and how the list is lost?
ata_unused used to hold all drives that were not claimed by any driver,
now idedefault_driver claims all that drives, all drives go in the .list
of its driver. ide_register_driver wants to take all unused drives and
attach them to the newly registered driver, so take all drives that use
idedefault_driver, and try, if they fail to find a driver they end up
again with the same driver and list (idedefault_driver). I think
idedefault_driver.list and ata_unused became dublicates, and the proper
place is to hold drives with no real driver is idedefault_driver, so the
patch. list from ata_unused becomes idedefault_driver.list, and does
exactly the same as ata_unused. I want to understand where i'm wrong, 
please?
The bug is there,  and waiting to explode, keeping both lists would mean to 
add one more  list head  in ide_drive_t,  is that the fix you want?
