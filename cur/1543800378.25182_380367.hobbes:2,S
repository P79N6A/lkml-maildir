This point only discusses the inline change, which were (without 
unit-at-a-time) in your measurements 2.9%.
Your patch might be simple, but it also might have side effects in cases 
where we _really_ want the code forced to be inlined. How simple is it 
to prove that your uninline patch doesn't cause a subtle breakage 
somewhere?
inline's in .c files are nearly always wrong (there might be very few 
exceptions), and this should simply be fixed.
Applying Arjan's uninlining patch [1] against 2.6.15-rc5-mm3 (ignoring a 
few rejects at applying the patch), I'm getting more than 0.6% .text 
savings (this is with a "compile everything .config", without 
unit-at-a-time and with -Os).
