Oh yes, it will be.  See below.

Danger, Will Robinson.  GRUB, Etherboot, and a whole bunch of other boot 
loaders will recognize an ELF binary and load it as such.  They will 
typically load it as an executable (not a relocatable object) -- I doubt 
many of them check that appropriate part of the ELF header -- so unless 
your kernel can be safely loaded *AND RUN* in that mode this is not 
going to work.
The entrypoint is going to be a major headache, since the standard 
kernel is entered in real mode, whereas an ELF file will typically be 
entered in protected mode, quite possibly using the C calling convention 
to pass the command line as (argc, argv).  God only knows how they're 
going to deal with an initrd.
It may very well be that the ELF magic number has to be obfuscated.
