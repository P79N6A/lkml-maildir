Before I put __raw_* there, code was using direct *(u_int32_t*)(mmio +
reg) = value, and nobody complained... (and it worked on my PReP box).
It seems that PPC does not reorder concurrent writes targetting one
device.

It is due to compatibility with XFree (or at least I was told) - they want 
both framebuffer and accelerator in big-endian mode, so there is really no
choice (other than not supporting ppc...).
But of course, I can use writel(swab(...)) to get big-endian PCI
accesses if __raw_* does not work on your hardware...
