The problem is that it's not regularly used on a wide range
of boxes so it will eventually break again. We had this cycle several
times already.
It's also missing a lot of the workarounds for broken SRATs that
are needed for many of the existing NUMA systems.
If there's consensus i386 NUMA is useful I can drop it, but I predict
it will just eventually break again.

I have a lot of i386 or combined i386/x86-64 patches in my tree - just Andrew's 
merge script doesn't pick that up.
