I have one objection: it is the poorest possible implementation in terms of
storage usage. You may have TBs free on database and ran full on webspace,
fluctuation on email is dramatic. You waste a damn lot of resources with this
approach.
I consider it usable but inferior in terms of costs and scalability. One can
very well argue you have to waste bucks to avoid hardlinks (which you don't
have at this point). Not having hardlinks costs obviously more. In fact a very
good commercial argument pro hardlinks.
If you have all your partitions only logically organised on one SAN you have to
remount via nfs quite a bit to get things in the right trees. That does not
sound like a performance setup. Did you manage to remount "mount --bind"
volumes?

which basically means on your access server you have to follow symlinks which
is yet another security issue in itself.
Basically you avoid a clean hardlink-setup with a symlink-setup rising possible
security drawbacks and a lot of remounting to get things straight...
I am not really convinced.
