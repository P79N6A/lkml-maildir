Think Suspend-To-Disk; in that case tmpfs looks pretty persistent to me.
So what does STD do?  It pushes memory out to swap.
Now, tmpfs could probably do the same thing on its own either to a private 
swap or an mmap.  I am suggesting mmap, as swap is currently really slow 
with tmpfs, and switching it to use mmap may buy us 2 for the price of 1.
Thanks!
