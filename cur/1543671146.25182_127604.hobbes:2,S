Title:
Reducing System Reboot Time With kexec
Abstract:
kexec is a developing feature for Linux 2.5.x that allows an x86 Linux
kernel to load and run another kernel instead of the platform BIOS and
bootloader. By skipping the platform BIOS during a reboot, kexec can
reduce downtime in enterprise class systems, and reduce turn-around time
for Linux kernel developers. This paper presents measurements of boot
time reduction through the use of kexec.
