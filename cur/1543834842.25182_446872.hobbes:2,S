Yes, ACPI is involved in the boot-time enumeration of various timers
and counters.  But at run-time; the use of any and all of them
(including the PM_TIMER supplied by ACPI hardware itself) could/should
appear generic to kernel users, who should not have to directly call
any routine with an "acpi" in it.
I believe that this is true today, and can/should stay true.
