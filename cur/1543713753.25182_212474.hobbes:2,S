r8169 seems to work though it is not even a tad bit faster
than plain 2.6.5.
Those cards are really driving me nuts. Between two r8169 cards, one
on Athlon with kernel 2.4.24, one on Athlon with 2.6.5 or 2.4.24, I
get 90Mbit/s in one direction and 39Mbit/s in the other using iperf and
TCP. With iperf and UDP they deliver 100Mbit/s resp. 230Mbit/s depending
on the direction. Crosschecking with my PowerBook (OS X) shows that I 
can
get 844Mbit/s (UDP) or 572Mbit/s (TCP) to one host and 844Mbit/s (UDP) 
but
only 88Mbit/s (TCP) to the other.
The environment is switched and changing cables and/or ports doesn't
improve the results.
Ideas? (Yeah, I'll get Intel NICs RSN...)
Servus,
