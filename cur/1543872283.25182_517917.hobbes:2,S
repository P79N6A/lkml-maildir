what must be unique is the four-parts of a connection
source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port
as long as the set is unique any element can be re-used (a big webserver has one 
IP and port on the server side, but many IPs and ports on the client side)
when you make a connection you have the option of not specifying the source IP 
and port (letting the OS/library pick ones for you). some libraries will not 
re-use the same source port for multiple connections, others will (with the 
appropriate options)
if you want to have your program assign the source IPs and port itself you can 
do so (you may have to also give the library/os a flag that tells it you know 
what you're doing, and it's ok to let you re-use ports)
