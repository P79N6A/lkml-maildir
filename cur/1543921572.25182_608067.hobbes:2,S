Hi, Sam, Al and others.
I just followed what Sam told me, errors are much fewer this time,
but still exist. Error messages are:
  CC      arch/um/kernel/syscall.o
  CC      arch/um/kernel/sysrq.o
arch/um/kernel/sysrq.c: In function ‘show_stack’:
arch/um/kernel/sysrq.c:63: error: ‘UESP’ undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/um/kernel/sysrq.c:63: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
arch/um/kernel/sysrq.c:63: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [arch/um/kernel/sysrq.o] Error 1
make: *** [arch/um/kernel] Error 2
Or I missed something again?
And I use `make defconfig ARCH=um' to generate .config, my tree
is 2.6.23-git16 (Al, is this OK?).
Thanks.
