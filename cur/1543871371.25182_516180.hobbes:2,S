Before worrying, I think it would make more sense to instrument the 
benefit gained against doing more "traditional" runtime management - 
that is, simply shutting down the ethernet chipset or doing ac97 power 
management. It's trivial to add those to the existing drivers, and if 
the additional benefit of using the Sony-specific methods is small then 
it's probably not really worth working out how to add it in.
Plus, implementing the generic support benefits more people :)
