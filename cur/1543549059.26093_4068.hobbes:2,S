I just want to let you know that I am experiencing the same problem with
2.4.0test9-pre1. This is with an old ISA 486 box with 32M. Behavior is a
little bit different: I don't see the first line of the kernel messages
and I get a hard reset.
2.4.0test8 booted fine and I have stripped the test9-pre1 patch down to
80k because the rest (acpi, drivers/net, drivers/usb, for example) was not
configured in. The problem stays...
The patch still contains (from memory):
- mktime movement
- char/mem.c
- char/nvram.c
- scsi/sd.c
- everything from fs/ (except nfs, not enabled)
- everything from kernel/
- Rik's VM patches
- net/core/sock.c
The biggest part that is still in the patch are Rik's VM enhancements
although I do not think that they are the cause of the problem in this
early stage. Seems to be a strange side effect...
I cannot give you much more information since I am in the office now but
feel free to ask.
