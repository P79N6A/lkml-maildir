Subject: [PATCH] alsa: correct nonsensical sysfs device symlinks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch was generated against 2.6.20-rc5; it fixes a bug that
cropped up in a late 2.6.19-mm kernel.
When ALSA's sysfs device creation was converted from using
class_device_create() to device_create(), the fourth param from
class_device_create() [dev] was simply plugged into arg 2 of
device_create().  This causes the device symlinks under all the
class/sound/[node] to point to nonsensical places.  Among other
problems, this breaks HAL and all audio software that depends on HAL.
The nature of this bug is not simply a need to update HAL;
class/[node]/device symlinks are required to point to a device entry
in /sys/devices; the bug causes them to point to other places within
/sys/class.  This patch is [hopefully] a trivial change to restore the
desired behavior.
