Hi,
I finally got fed up with not having enough free interrupts on my Tyan
Tomcat IV system, and also got fed up with the MP-BIOS being buggy so
that PCI interrupt sharing won't work.
The following patch allows me to have four PCI cards in the machine,
and have the USB ports enabled, and have a Gravis Ultrasound (which
wants to IRQs) and a multi-IO serial/parallel card (which wants
another two IRQs) working at the same time.
I think I'll have some sleep now...  have fun.
