Thanks!  I didn't think of the possibility of anyone distributing
precompiled kernels from the "pre-rc" window, but if Fedora does it
(hopefully for beta-testers only), it should be absolutely clear that
it's not just a release with some minor fixes.
Anyone adjusting any software for that kernel would be adjusting for the
next kernel release.
