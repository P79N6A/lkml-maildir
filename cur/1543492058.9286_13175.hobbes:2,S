I think Mike just means updating his BIOS without having to boot
off a DOS bootdisk. Flashing the BIOS with zero bytes is hardly
useful :)

Nopo. It only overwrites the contents of your NVRAM (hence the
device name). That's where your BIOS stores its config information.
Thus it's nasty enough.
If you want to overwrite your flash, there is a /dev/bios driver
written by a guy called Stefan Reinauer. Have a look at
http://www.freiburg.linux.de/~stepan/bios/
 for more information.
I never used it and I don't know whether I would use it without having
a means of restoring my Flash BIOS if things go wrong.
Over and out,
