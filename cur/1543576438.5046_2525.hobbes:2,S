bigphysarea is the wrong model for 2.4. The bootmem allocator means that
drivers could do early claims via the bootmem interface during boot up. That
would avoid all the cruft.
For 2.2 bigphysarea is a hack, but a neccessary add on patch and not one you
can redo cleanly as we don't have bootmem
I belive Pauline Middelink had a patch implementing bigphysarea in terms of
bootmem
