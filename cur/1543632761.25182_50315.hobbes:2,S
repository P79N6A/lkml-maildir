I think (hope) you meant 1+5, which will stand any three disk failure, and
up to 1+N/2 if just the right drives fail. They never do, of course.

I doubt it. Unless you run a system with heavy CPU demand there are lots
of cycles for this stuff. I run 0+1 several places and I don't see serious
CPU load. I would be very interested in RAID-6 in the kernel, but I have
the feeling that RAID-6 means diferent things to diferent people, judging
from posts here and articles online. I haven't found the performance info
you, I assume I will.
