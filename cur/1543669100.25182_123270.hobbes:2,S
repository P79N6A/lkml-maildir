I suggested at one point the following change:
Instead of having the filesystem open() method being passed in a pointer 
to already allocated, partially initialized file structure, that code 
should be moved to a library function, and instead let the open() method 
return a struct file *.  That way open() could either return a reference 
to an already-allocated file or a new one.
