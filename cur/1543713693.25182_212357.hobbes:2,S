No. VXE has completely different architecture.
Separate logical copy of LISP program is for each
subsystem we protect. (sure they share the same code
of LISP interpreter). So, if there will be any
problems - it's for particular subsystem only. Other
subsystems (protected and not protected) will not be
affected.
It's like event driven model. There is no constantly
running servers.

It's misunderstanding. There are no any recursion
restrictions. Author of particular security model
(LISP program) should avoid recursions; it's not very
hard actually. When we write program at language other
than LISP - we rarely use recursion. Yes, it's against
LISP style, but not a big problem.

I know the better one.
"As all Real Programmers know, the only useful data
structure is the Array. Strings, Lists, Structures,
Sets-- these are all special cases of arrays and can
be treated that way just as easily without messing up
your programming language with all sorts of
complications."
