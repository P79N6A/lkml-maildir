Please add me to the CC, then.  I noticed this thread by accident.

ibm-acpi does not implement display poweroff, so if a screen-saving function
on the kernel is trying to use it to shut the display off, it will either
fail to do anything, or if it ALSO sets brightness to zero, it will just dim
the display.
Richard, would you like a patch to -ENOSYS if a display power management
event reaches ibm-acpi?
