I think people overestimate the numbner of large boxes badly. Several IDE
pre-patches didn't work on highmem boxes. It took *ages* for people to
actually notice there was a problem. The desktop world is still 128-256Mb
and some of the crap people push is problematic even there. In the embedded
space where there is a *ton* of money to be made by smart people a lot
of the 2.5 choices look very questionable indeed - but not all by any
means, we are for example close to being able to dump the block layer,
shrink stacks down by using IRQ stacks and other good stuff.
I'm hoping the Montavista and IBM people will swat each others bogons 8)
