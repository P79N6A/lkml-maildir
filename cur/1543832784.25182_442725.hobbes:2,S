a) Because acpi_ac_init() forgot to check acpi_disabled, so
   acpi_ac_init() calls acpi_lock_ac_dir() even with acpi=off.
b) Because acpi_lock_ac_dir() is doing down() on an uninitialised
   semaphore, which hangs.
The fix to b) is in your tree now.
The fix for a) is below.
From: Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz>
With acpi=off and acpi_ac/battery compiled into kernel, acpi breaks
boot. This fixes it.
