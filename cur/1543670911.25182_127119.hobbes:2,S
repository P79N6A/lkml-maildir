I can only assume that the code presented is the only code that
was executed. You are correct that DS may have never even been
set. The data segment may be in some non-writable space, which
is hard to find now-days with most evenything being shadowed
and left writable. Many modern chip-sets can't turn off write,
maybe it was too expensive from a performance standpoint.
