Zero bits in the mask mean that the chip will not generate a processor
interrupt for the type of event represented by the bit. And the
difference between what can be read from IntEventClear and IntEventSet
is that the former is the masked version of the latter.
You probably noticed yourself that ohci1394's interrupt handler
explicitly enables some bits in the interrupt mask shortly before the
call to hpsb_selfid_complete. This means there is either something going
wrong during hpsb_selfid_complete (which wouldn't surprise me, since
there are busy wait loops involved) or the write access to the interrupt
mask wasn't flushed soon enough.

This mask looks much better.

As you wrote, both cards use the same link layer controller, although
they could have different chip revisions. The controllers of the
Indigita card sit behind the bridge, which /perhaps/ contributes to the
problem. But perhaps more importantly, how are the IRQs distributed?
# cat /proc/interrupts
Anyway, I think a driver problem is more likely the cause than a
potential hardware issue.
Please add
	reg_read(ohci, OHCI1394_IntMaskSet);
right before hpsb_selfid_complete(host, phyid, isroot);. This will flush
the previous reg_write before hpsb_selfid_complete starts doing
unspeakable things.
And I should finally start to work on a fix for hpsb_selfid_complete,
i.e. move all the time-consuming but less time-critical parts off into a
tasklet or workqueue job...
Question to others:
ohci1394.c::ohci_irq_handler() is taking a per-host spinlock around some
register reads and writes, particularly:
...
	spin_lock_irqsave(&ohci->event_lock, flags);
	event = reg_read(ohci, OHCI1394_IntEventClear);
	reg_write(ohci, OHCI1394_IntEventClear, event &
						~OHCI1394_busReset);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ohci->event_lock, flags);
...
	spin_lock_irqsave(&ohci->event_lock, flags);
	reg_write(ohci, OHCI1394_IntMaskClear, OHCI1394_busReset);
	run_an_insane_loop_as_an_alleged_fix_for_dorky_hardware;
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ohci->event_lock, flags);
...
	spin_lock_irqsave(&ohci->event_lock, flags);
	reg_write(ohci, OHCI1394_IntEventClear, OHCI1394_busReset);
	reg_write(ohci, OHCI1394_IntMaskSet, OHCI1394_busReset);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ohci->event_lock, flags);
I think these spinlocks are totally useless 1. because
ohci_irq_handler() is only called as the hardware interrupt servicing
routine and 2. because they don't flush the register write operations.
Right? Wrong? [Ohci1394's reg_write() is a writel().]
