Why was the release of 2.3.0 kernel announced on slashdot? Now we'll get
clueless fuckwits installing broken 2.3.x kernels and complaining loudly
that it sucks simply because they don't realise it is a DEVELOPMENT
kernel!
The press release on slashdot made no distinction between the 2.2.x and
2.3.x kernels, unfortunately. 
How about we break 2.3.1 (intrdouce some serious disk corruption) to teach
them the errors of their ways!
Cheers,
Alex.
