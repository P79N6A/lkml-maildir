I have been working on exactly this problem and then some for the past
little while. Hopefully I'll release a first draft of my stuff to the MTD
group sometime this week (
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org/
).

Yes, you will need to write a custom boot loader, when I left off work
Friday I had that doing everything but setting up the final bits to jump
to the kernel. The boot loader is structured as a bios extension and
modeled after the etherboot package - it boots directly from an image
stored in a FFS2 file system for which I have also written a R/W linux
driver for.. To make use it your flash has to map an 8k region of itself
into upper memory.

I've done two things in the past, the first is a simple compressed root
image and using the boot loader to bring that and the kernel into ram -
but that is not very good if you need to store state information, so my
latest focus has been to place a filesystem on the flash, using FFS2, a FS
designed specifically for flash.
