hi *,
as mentioned before, the current lxdialog with kernels 2.0.35 (iirc) and up,
as well as 2.1.1xx (iirc) have for some people the side effect that the
colors aren't correct anymore when using make menuconfig.
I have found a working version of lxdialog and even have both sources -- the
one that fails and the one that doesn't.
I have asked the maintainer if he could take a look at it some time ago but
lost his mail address.
Is there anyone with the right skills to take a look at this problem ? I
know that other people also have reported this problem, at least to Alan
Cox.
Eventually, bot sources are available on request.
Thanks ..
Roeland
