Well, Congratulations, Doctor!!  [Must be nice to be exiled to Stony 
Brook!!  Oh, well, not I]
For some reason, I can not connect to the above link, but I may not need 
to.  Does [should] it contain a link/pointer to the underlying source 
code?  This concept sounds very interesting, and I am sure that many of 
us would like to look closer, and maybe even get a taste.
Here's hoping that source exists, and that it is available for us.
Thanks
