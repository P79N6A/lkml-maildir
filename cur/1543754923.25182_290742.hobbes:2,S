Hi!

:-) Heh, nice idea, but it is going to be really confusing to anyone
reading the code in between.

I'll do some testing later.

It is still used as a scratch space at end of page, please leave the
comment.

Can you do return error instead? Goto is ugly. Or just break. Same in
next chunks.

!!( ) is usually used for this.
