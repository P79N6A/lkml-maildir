then you are saying that on the platforms without an iommu the pci_map_*
cannot fail, of course, furthmore even a missing pci_unmap cannot
trigger an iommu address space leak on those platforms. That has nothing
to do with the fact pci_map_single can fail or not, the device drivers
are not architectural specific.

Whatever sparc64 does to hide the driver bugs you can break it if you
pci_map 4G+1 bytes of phyical memory.  Otherwise it means it's sleeping
or looping inside the pci_map functions which would break things in
another manner.
