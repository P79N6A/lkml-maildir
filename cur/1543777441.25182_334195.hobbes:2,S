The check still only allows i/o that is multiple of the device block
size.  That will always be a requirement.
I was trying to ask:
Do drivers have problems with odd addresses or with
non-512 addresses?
In my limited testing, I saw problems with odd user space
addresses on IDE (using DMA).  When testing 2-byte aligned
addresses, I did not see any problems, and so far, the data
looks correct.
I am continuing to test and this patch allows other to try
it out as well.  For the most part, it should be safe because
nobody has application code that uses O_DIRECT with non-aligned
addresses.  Obviously, it will only be ready for mainline
if/when we fix all the drivers.
Thanks,
Daniel
