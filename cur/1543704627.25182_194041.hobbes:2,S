Haven't looked at it yet. Several crash reports so far, mostly
lockups right after printing the number of pages to save. I wonder
if we have something broken in there. It dies for me once too at
this point.
Also, at least on pmac laptops, the HD is usually so fast, that
I suspect spending 10 seconds freeing things is less efficient than
spending this 10 seconds writing 200Mb of data to disk :) Also, one
wakup, it's quite painful to see everything be swapped in again. It
may make sense to be less agressive on the memory freeing, though
finding a good balance isn't easy.
