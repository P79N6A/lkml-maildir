The problem with mwdma2 drive attached to piix4 (430tx chipset) is still 
present in 2.4.21-pre1. It no more hangs like 2.4.19 and 2.4.20 did but it 
behaves like 2.4.19-ac - lots of error messages, machine stops during ide 
errors or reinitialization for several seconds but recovers and error is 
given to userspace. The drive works well in 2.4.18.
dmesg:
hdd: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x61

After this line, hdd is offline an no sector is readable, read gest IO 
error.
