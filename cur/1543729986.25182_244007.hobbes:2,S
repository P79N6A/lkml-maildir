that fact wasn't obvious to me -- i've updated the BIOS and the strange
banias signature is now gone.  it reports the expected "Intel(R)
Pentium(R) M processor 1400MHz" string now.
in excess the "ACPI-behaviour" changes from "totally broken" to "not
working" which is kind of a progress... 8-}

it seems that the reported value depends on the mental health of the
BIOS-programmer at hand, therefore the suplied string might not be
trustworthy.
if i understand correctly, the type of the cpu can be determined by
looking at the family, model and stepping -- assuming that these values
are reported directly  by the CPUID (0FA2) instruction. 
the BIOS supplied model_name string in speedstep-centrino.c is parsed to
get the clock cycle time of the cpu.  is this actually supposed to be
the "right" way (or worse: the only way) to get this information?
