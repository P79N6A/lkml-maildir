But that code has not ever run, since early 2.5 days.  Don't tell me
people are used to it :)

That does not work the way you are asking it to work.  pci_module_init()
is just a replacement for pci_register_driver these days.  It will
return either "0" if the driver is successfully registered, or a
negative value if something bad happened.  It will not return the number
of devices that this driver bound to.
So, if no devices are in the system, it will return 0, and again, the
code you are wanting to run, will not.
So, how about using the new pci_dev_present() call instead?  That should
be what you want, right?
thanks,
