Btw, the "low TLB entry" for the direct-mapped case can't be used as a 
hugetlb page anyway, due to the MMU splitting it up due to the special 
MTRR regions, if I recall correctly.
So this is probably a bigger performance win than just the difference 
between using one or two TLB entries.
The same should be true on x86, btw. Where we should use a physical start 
address of 4MB for best performance.
Does anybody want to run benchmarks? (Totally untested, may not boot, 
might physically accost your pets for all I know).
