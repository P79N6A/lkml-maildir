UidSEC LSM
This module extends the standard UN*X "resource protection" model adding
some features useful for untrusted multiuser systems 
Current features
  * Deny usage of dmesg to unprivileged users 
  * Hide processes of "other users" to unprivileged users (example: sam
    can only see his processes during a 'top' or a 'ps aux') 
  * Deny access to /sys and /config to unprivileged users 
  * Protect usage of bind() syscall using UidBIND 
  * Assign a group that can use dmesg and see all system processes
