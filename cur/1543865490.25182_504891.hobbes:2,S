How about leaving the existing code with the following minor 
modifications:
Instead of calling filemap_copy_from_user{,_iovec}() do only the atomic 
bit with pagefaults disabled, i.e. instead of filemap_copy_from_user() we 
would do (could of course move into a helper function of course):
pagefault_disable()
kaddr = kmap_atomic(page, KM_USER0);
left = __copy_from_user_inatomic_nocache(kaddr + offset, buf, bytes);
kunmap_atomic(kaddr, KM_USER0);
pagefault_enable()
if (unlikely(left)) {
	/* The user space page got unmapped before we got to copy it. */
	...
}
Thus the 99.999% (or more!) of the time the code would just work as it 
always has and there is no bug and no speed impact.  Only in the very rare 
and hard to trigger race condition that the user space page after being 
faulted in got thrown out again before we did the atomic memory copy do we 
run into the above "..." code path.
I would propose to call out a different function altogether which could do 
a multitude of things including drop the lock on the destination page 
(maintaining a reference on the page!), allocate a temporary page, copy 
from the user space page into the temporary page, then lock the 
destination page again, and copy from the temporary page into the 
destination page.
This would be slow but who cares given it would only happen incredibly 
rarely and on majority of machines it would never happen at all.
The only potential problem I can see is that the destination page could be 
truncated whilst it is unlocked.  I can see two possible solutions to 
this:
1) Invent a new page flag and run "SetDoNotTruncatePage()" before dropping 
the page lock, then modify truncate code paths to check for page locked 
and the new flag and not truncate a page if the new flag is set, just like 
they would if it was locked.  Basically treat the two bits as equivalent 
for truncate purposes.
I think 1) would be best but a possible alternative would be:
2) Make commit write check whether a page has been truncated and if so 
make it abort the operation/transaction (or non-journalling file systems 
can probably just ignore the call completely).  Then simply restart the 
generic_file_buffered_write() call by faulting the user space page in 
again, etc.  And this time round things will just work again.  I guess it 
would be possible that we hit the same race condition again and again and 
again so we would loop for ever but the chances for that are even less 
than the original race condition.  I suppose to guard against it we could 
have a counter that say limited to X retries and if that failed the write 
would be aborted with -EDEADLOCK or something.  As I said I think 1) would 
be nicer...
What do you think?
Best regards,
