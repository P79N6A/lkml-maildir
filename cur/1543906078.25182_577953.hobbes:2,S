Teresa was already using 2.6.22.1, with CFS (v19.1) patched in, so reverting 
that would be a matter of patching it out again. She said she wasn't seeing 
trouble on other kernels though.
I was the one who also saw keyboard trouble on 2.6.22.1 without CFS by the 
way -- and haven't (yet) seen any anymore since patching _in_ CFS v19.1...
