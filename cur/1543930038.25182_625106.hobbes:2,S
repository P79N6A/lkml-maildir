And printk a warning, because the programmer's static analysis was
wrong.

And progress is being made, everybody is happy.

OK, I see where you are going.  The programmer statically determines a 
total reservation for the stack, which is big enough that progress is 
guaranteed.  We then throttle based on actual memory consumption, and 
essentially use a heuristic to decide when we are near the upper limit.  
Workable I think, but...
The main idea, current->pages_used_for_block_allocations++ is valid only 
in direct call context.  If a daemon needs to allocate memory on behalf 
of the IO transfer (not unusual) it won't get accounted, which is 
actually the central issue in this whole class of deadlocks.  Any idea 
how to extend the accounting idea to all tasks involved in a particular 
block device stack?
