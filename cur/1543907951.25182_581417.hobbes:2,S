Did you also check IRR bits on LAPIC. May be some interrupt is already
being served and your new interrupts has been queued on LAPIC and IRR bit
on LAPIC is set?
Following is the text from intel system programming manual.
The IRR contains the active interrupt requests that have been accepted, but
not yet dispatched to the processor for servicing. When the local APIC accepts
an interrupt, it sets the bit in the IRR that corresponds the vector of the
accepted interrupt. When the processor core is ready to handle the next
interrupt, the local APIC clears the highest priority IRR bit that is set and
sets the corresponding ISR bit. The vector for the highest priority bit set in
the ISR is then dispatched to the processor core for servicing.
In this case, I suspect that your interrupt gets queued at LAPIC (IRR is set)
but it does not make into ISR (may be because interrupts are disabled and
some other vector is already being served. Can you please paste your LAPIC
and IOAPIC state here.
Thanks
Vivek
