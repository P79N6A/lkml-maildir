But you _need_ the config. Even with your own makefiles, how are you going
to get it right for all new kernels that $CRAPDISTRO ships in a broken form, 
if you don't have the configs?
If distros ship broken crap which doesn't let you build modules, there's 
really not a lot you can do except note their quality control for the 
record and report it in their bug tracking system.
You are _always_ going to have problems with people shipping shite, or
possibly even actively going our of their way to prevent out-of-tree modules
building. It's fairly much an orthogonal problem though, isn't it?
