This popped up a few years ago.

Obviously, nothing came about it. And I suspect the problem (running
out of stack space) is even worse these days with 4k stacks. Why is
this even done recursively?
Note that 5 symlinks is quite a burden. I got hit by it a few days ago
with my farm of symlinks between nfs RAID disks and my home directory
(~/raid points to /nfs/cluster, papers refers to ~/raid/papers,
Astro-ph refers to ~/papers/Astro-ph, and then I autofs shfs mounted
~/ from another host, which involve a couple of symlinks again (/host
to /mnt/nfshost and /mnt/nfshost to /var/autofs/misc/host and ~/host
to /host - the first two so that when the network goes down, all I
have to do is remove (by script) /mnt/nfshost, and then autofs wont
try to mount something it can't when something tries to access
~/host)).
