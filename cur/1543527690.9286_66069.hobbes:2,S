So...  you are choosing to lose extremely valuable optimizations because
of a few prototype warnings?  This logic seems bogus to me...  it also
seems like a slap fix instead of fixing the real problem...
Jakub commented to me not a couple weeks ago about how -fno-builtin was
a bad idea.  Maybe you could dig this message up in the linux-kernel
archives?
