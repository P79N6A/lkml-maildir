Subject: Kernel oops in tcp_ipv4.c

I am running a medium-high traffic web server on an SMP machine. I have
always had problems with linux hanging (No syslog messages and no
console response). I have tried kernel versions 2.2.12, 2.2.14 and
2.2.16
Recently I tried 2.2.17, this kernel was up for about a month, before
there was a kernel oops. The syslog messages are:
Jan 11 21:10:06 ws2 kernel: tcp_v4_hash: bug, socket state is 1 
Jan 11 21:10:06 ws2 kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address 00000000 
Jan 11 21:10:06 ws2 kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 0ca7c000, %cr3 = 0ca7c000 
Jan 11 21:10:06 ws2 kernel: *pde = 00000000 
Jan 11 21:10:06 ws2 kernel: Oops: 0002 
Jan 11 21:10:06 ws2 kernel: CPU:    0 
The code that outputs the first message is in tcp_ipv4.c, and was added
in version 2.2.17. The code deliberately causes a kernel oops when it
encounters this bug, presumably because the IP stack is unusable at this
point.
If this code was deliberately added then presumably someone knows what
might cause the problem. Is there a patch somewhere that fixes this
problem?
regards,
Patrick
