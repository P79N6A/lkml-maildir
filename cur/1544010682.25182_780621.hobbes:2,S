yes, but 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-unstable-standalone.git
 is a small repository, just containing the btrfs driver.  even if kernel repo is 100 times bigger, i don`t see the point why this should not work. if it puts too much load on the server and/or doesn`t work anyway, then it`s better to disable that instead of letting stupid users like me waste their time with that ;)

i did, but it didn`t work either. i`m behind a http proxy. that`s why i chose the gitweb option.
