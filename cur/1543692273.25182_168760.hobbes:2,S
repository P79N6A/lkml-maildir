For those who are trying this for the first time, please note that the 
scheduler has been tuned to tell the difference between tasks of the _same_ 
nice level. This means do NOT renice X or it will make audio skip unless you 
also renice your audio application by the same amount. Lots of distributions 
have done this for the old 2.4 scheduler which could not treat equal "nice" 
levels as differently as the new scheduler does and 2.6 shouldn't need 
special treatment.
So for testing note the following points:
Make sure X is NOT reniced to -10 as many distributions are doing.
Some shells spawn processes at nice +5 by default and this will make audio 
apps suffer.
Make sure your hard disk, graphics card and audio card are performing at equal 
standard to your 2.4 kernel (ie dma is working, graphics is fully accelerated 
etc).
before commenting on audio performance.
