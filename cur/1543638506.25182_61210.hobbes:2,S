Yes, I saw those.  I still like the Rice work a _lot_ better.  It's
just a thing of beauty, from a design point of view (disclaimer: I
haven't seen the implementation, so there may be ugly things
lurking...).

Yes, you're probably right.  2MB was reported to be fine in the Rice
experiments, but I doubt 256MB (and much less 4GB, as supported by
some CPUs) would fly.
