I prototyped something like this in SunOS years ago.  It was a big win
for responsiveness because I used it to make executable pagefaults have
higher priority than writes.  
It never went in because there are fairness issues - consider a system
generating a lot of dirty pages and you are giving reads higher priority.
The system grinds to a halt.  I never solved that part of the problem.
Anyway, there is an easy way to do this - every operating system has a 
disk queue with pending disk I/Os.  Just turn that into multiple queues.
