However, bus_to_virt() can only be used on addresses which correspond
with system RAM.  readl and friends should not be used on such a memory
space.  So, this driver is doing lots of bogus stuff.
The warnings are perfectly valid and should therefore stay.
If "reply" is actually referring to some system memory, the readl/writel
shouldn't be there, and we should be accessing system memory directly
via a bona-fide structure.  If it isn't, then the bus_to_virt() is
completely bogus and unportable, and that's where we _must_ raise a
warning.
However, I do agree with changing "msg" to be void __iomem *, and
removing the (ulong) cast, since pHba->msg_addr_virt is already
void __iomem *.
(note: I'm just taking a passing interest in this thread, from the
point of view of an architecture maintainer who wants these types of
things to be Correct(tm)...)
