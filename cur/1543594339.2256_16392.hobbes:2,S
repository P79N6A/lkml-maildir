OK with me - I've completely missed his point when I was replying.
For now I'd go for list_add_tail() (if you check the patch you'll
see that this line was simply moved from get_empty_super() - verbatim).
Order may matter performance-wise and now we can control it, but I'd
leave experiments in that direction until 2.5. Anything that relied on
any specific order is broken, but let's not add that into the mix for
the time being, OK?
