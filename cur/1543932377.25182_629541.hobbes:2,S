This is a relatively minor detail in the rather bigger context of this
patch, but...

That seems like a relatively hefty addition to every inode in the system
when revoke - I think - will be a fairly rare operation.  Would there be
any significant cost to using a single, global revoke-wait queue instead
of growing the inode structure?
