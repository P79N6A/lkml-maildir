and this is what the scheduler didnt do properly, it actually didnt
schedule valid ready-to-run processes for long milliseconds, it switched
between two sched_yield processes, starving the CPU-intensive process. I
posted a patch for 2.5 that fixes this, and the 2.4.19-pre10-ac2 backport
i did includes this fix as well:

(1)-scheduler/sched-2.4.19-pre10-ac2-A4
a good sched_yield() implementation should give *all* other tasks a chance
to run, instead of switching between multiple sched_yield()-ing tasks. I
don think this is specified anywhere, but it's a quality of implementation
issue.
