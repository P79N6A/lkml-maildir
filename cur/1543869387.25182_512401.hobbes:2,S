Hi!
I've lately tried to run a ISA card (HP 82341, with drivers from the  
Linux GPIB project, latest version), but the module failed to get  
loaded. Modprobe said it couldn't find a symbol (Undefined symbol  
'isapnp_read_byte'), although it was present in /boot/System.map and  
/proc/kallsyms. After some googleing, trying to compile a new kernel,  
looking into code, etc, I found out what the problem was. The function  
"isapnp_read_byte" was no longer been exported. You can find the line  
in question here [1] (note the #if 0). The patch that did this change  
was this [2] one.
I'm not sure, but as I understand it, it was not intended to comment  
this EXPORT_SYMBOLS(isapnp_read_byte) out. So it probably just  
happened by accident?
I've attached a patch for the latest stable kernel (2.6.20.1). Please  
apply it.
Greetings
Sacher
