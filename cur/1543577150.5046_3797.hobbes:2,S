I think I found it. Could everybody who was getting the crash on ISDN line
hangup try if the following patch fixes the problem?
I think the problem was that we relied on divert_if being initialized to
zero automatically, which didn't happen because it was not declared static
and therefore not in .bss (*is this true?*).

I also attached a patch which disables diversion service being selected as
built-in during kernel config, because this doesn't work yet.
