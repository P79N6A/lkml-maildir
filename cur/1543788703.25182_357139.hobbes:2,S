The correct solution would be to add the missing functionality to
net/socket.c and move over the implementation of SIOC* from
fs/compat_ioctl.c. Getting the code path right is a little tricky,
but I think a patch to fix this up would be appreciated.
As a start, you could define a compat_sock_ioctl along the
lines of compat_blkdev_ioctl and add your own handlers to the
x25_proto_ops, but IMHO it would makes sense to get rid of stuff
like dev_ifsioc from fs/compat_ioctl.c at the same time by
introducing a new compat_dev_ioctl called from compat_sock_ioctl.
