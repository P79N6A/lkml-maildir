Michael,
NE2k ISAPNP broke around 2.5.64, again.  There are 2 parts to the attached
patch, one to move the NIC initialization earlier in the boot sequence
and the second is a HACK to get ne2k to work when compiled into the
kernel, I've never tried NE2k as a module...
1. The level of isapnp_init was moved to after apci.  Since it is now
   after net_dev_init, ISA PNP NICs fail to initialized at boot.
   This fix allows ISA PNP NIC cards to work during net_dev_init, and still
   leaves isapnp_init after apci_init.
2. The second piece kills off a now ?unnecessary? probe.
Works for me,
