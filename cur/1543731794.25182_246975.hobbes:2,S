There is no question that using PAGE_SIZE should be considered
harmful.  But this particular change to the linux-libc-headers
makes it easy for the common case (bog standard x86) folk to keep
using a fixed PAGE_SIZE value, and keep writing crap code which
is now _guaranteed_ to blow chunks on mips, x86_64, etc.
I think outright removal of PAGE_SIZE from user space may be a
much better choice, with some sortof #error perhaps...  Wouldn't
it be better for the whole world if people would get errors like
    foo.c:10:2: #error "Don't use PAGE_SIZE, use sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)"
making people actually fix their code?
