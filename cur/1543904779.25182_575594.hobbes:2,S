I think we still want to run dio_cleanup() if do_direct_IO() failed? 
Otherwise we can leak pages.
And there's nothing special about EFAULT or ENOMEM here: if do_direct_IO()
returns any error then that's it: we bale out, yes?
In fact I'm suspecting that this is what the code in there used to do. 
Something like:
	for (...) {
		...
		ret = do_direct_IO(...);
		...
		if (ret) {
			dio_dleanup(dio);
			break
		}
	}
	return ret;
but then someone later came along and added more code between the end of
the for loop and the `return' statement.

yep, that's exactly what happened.  We broke it in the 2.5.45 release back
in October 2002. (Where "we" == "Badari")
So I think what we need to do is something close to this:

 }

However I'd like to ask you guys to carefully review and test that please.
