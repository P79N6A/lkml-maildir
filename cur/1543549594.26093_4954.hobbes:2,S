I normally occupy over a meg with my image and I frequently build a LILO boot
disk for safekeeping.  I strip my config down to only enabled options and
further strip the CONFIG_ from it, then bzip2 -s -9 the both of config and
system map and it comes out to about 122K

The same idiots who have multiple patch trees that haven't been merged and
different builds of a kernel to test effects?  I.e. those who really do the
work on LKML?

After you're looking down the ladder of evolution, think to look up the
ladder.
Personally, /proc/ksyms has what I need for symbols but 1.3K for a .config is
trivial enough to add to the image.
