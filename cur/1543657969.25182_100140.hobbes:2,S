Hi Alan,
your
  [PATCH] rescue ftape from the ravages of that Rusty chap
removed zft_dirty from zftape-ctl.c in Linus' 2.5 tree. This seems to be
accidentially and wrong, it was the only definition of zft_dirty in the
whole kernel sources and now there's an error at the final linking of
the kernel. The patch below (against 2.5.54) re-adds it.
