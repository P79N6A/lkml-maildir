I agree it is broken, but it was considered a method of implementing
user-space locking for a long time..
The problem is in LinuxThreads mostly, I guess, according to Andrew.
But the big offender we hear about ten times a day is Open Office, which
calls sched_yield() after a lot of GUI operations, seemingly in the name
of interactivity.  It is busted and Red Hat shipped a yield-less Open
Office in RH9 which works fine.
