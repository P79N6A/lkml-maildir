Correct. But you don't have to treat isolated CPUs differently - they
are just the degenerate case of a partition of 1 CPU. I assume cpusets
could create similar "isolated" domains where no balancing takes place.

Fine.

So make the new rule "cpu_exclusive && direct-child-of-root-cpuset".
Your problems go away, and they haven't been pushed to userspace.
If a user wants to, for some crazy reason, have a set of cpu_exclusive
sets deep in the cpuset hierarchy, such that no load balancing happens
between them... just tell them they can't; they should just make those
cpusets children of the root.
