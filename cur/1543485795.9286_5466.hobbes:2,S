Yes, I know (for the corruption part) - but as it is a workaround for
the problem it seemed appropriate. A more appropriate(?) solution I
thought about was just let the closing process sleep for 40ms in
bttv_close - but this is ugly, too. I read the chip manual, too and
the grab-stop sequence in the driver meets the specs, but I rather
believe the symptoms than the specs :)
For the security reason, whats up with that?
Richard.
PS: the workaround (not fix) will stay in my personal tree until
    one comes up with a better solution to the problem. mm/fs
    corruption is not a minor problem.
