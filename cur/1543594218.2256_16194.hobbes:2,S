There's also the question of pci_ops() (PCI config space access 
routines). Alpha (titan in this example) uses:
	struct pci_controler *hose = dev->sysdata;
but the general idea is that you need the hose info to do 
config-space access on PCI.
The 256-bus fallacy is caused in part by an ambiguity in what we mean 
by "bus". In PCI spec talk, a bus is a very specify thing with an 
8-bit bus number, and this is reflected in various registers and 
address formats. On the other hand we have the general concept of 
buses, which includes the possibility of multiple PCI controllers, 
and thus multiple domains of 256 buses each.
As I recall, even a midline chipset such as the ServerWorks LE 
supports the use of two north bridges, which implies two PCI bus 
domains.
I'd favor adopting something like the Alpha approach, but with a 
dedicated struct pci_device item (and with "controller" spelled 
correctly). And I suppose "domain" sounds a little more sober than 
"hose". But since the domain information is necessary to access 
configuration registers, it really needs to be included in struct 
pci_device.
