Why not just disallow user-level use of the _syscall() macros.
syscall() is a much more portable and easier to implement alternative
which has been around "forever" (even SunOS supported it, IIRC).  I
suppose there is a slight performance loss (function-call vs.  inline)
but we're talking about system calls here...
Also, the _syscall() macros have never been supported at the
user-level on ia64 linux and most packages already know to use
syscall().  Unfortunately, some "clever" maintainers use syscall()
only inside #ifdef __ia64, but that would be easy to fix if _syscall()
gets discouraged on all linux platforms.
