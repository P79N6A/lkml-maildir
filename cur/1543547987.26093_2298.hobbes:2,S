It's the same kdb.  (I do need to re-sync with Andrea though, memleak
has been busted and fixed since way back then)  It happens the other
way around too.. sometimes ikd patches are against a more recent kernel
than the standalone kdb patch.

In any case, if the official release ikd is ever too old for anyone
(ikd is maintenance intensive.  Andrea wouldn't get any work done if
he released for every pre-patch), drop a line via private mail and
I'll extract/send what I'm running. #include <buyer_beware.h> ;-)
