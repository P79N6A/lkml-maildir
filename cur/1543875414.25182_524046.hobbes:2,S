Done, works. However there's a problem with accuracy comming from a
different angle.
I have this USB video grabber and also quite efficient way of putting
the pixels to the screen. Video is grabbed using isochronous
transfers, i.e. lots of small(on the order of 1K) chunks of data are
being transferred continously instead of one big burst unlike in, for
instance, PCI setup. With your accounting change idle from
`/proc/stat' is accurate but unfortunatelly top(1)/icewm's monitor/etc
apparently use user+sys+nice+intr+softirq+iowait to show the system
load, so system tools claim that the load is 10-12% while in reality
it is ~3%.
This situation is harder to write a hog-like testcase for. Anyhow it
seems the difference in percentage stems from the `intr' field of
`/proc/stat', which fits. And following patch (which should be applied
on top of yours) seems to help. I wouldn't really know what to do with
softirq and the rest of counts touched by this function, so i left them
alone.
Comments?
