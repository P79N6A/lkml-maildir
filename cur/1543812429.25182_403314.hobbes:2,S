Linux.

Changes:
Hackbench as a load was made optional during realtime testing instead of 
defaulting on as this load caused out of memory kills very easily. Some form 
of userspace starvation is occurring (and this may be something useful to 
instrument but I haven't the time).
Selecting or unselecting loads to benchmark was added (thanks Peter Williams)
Manpage was added (thanks Julien Valroff).
Cheers,
Con
