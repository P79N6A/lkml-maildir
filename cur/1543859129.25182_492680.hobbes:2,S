Well. But flush_workqueue() drops workqueue_mutex before going to sleep ?
	flush_workqueue(single_threaded_wq);
		...
		mutex_lock(&workqueue_mutex);
		...
		mutex_unlock(&workqueue_mutex);
		wait_for_completition();
							handler runs,
							calls flush_workqueue(),
							workqueue_mutex is free

Ok, it is time to sleep. I'll look tomorrov and re-send if flush_cpu_workqueue()
really needs "bool workqueue_mutex_is_locked" parameter.
