kbuild today create one file for each module in the
directory: .tmp_versions/
So in this case the module that is build lst is the winner.
I do not see any easy way to avoid this.
What we could do:
1) find another way to record what modules we have
2) embed path in filename
I did not try to actually implement any of the above
as the gain seems minimal compared to the additional complexity.
