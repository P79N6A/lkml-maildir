Subject: [PATCH] i386, x86_64: Change Boot Protocol to longer command lines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

After the kernel can handle command lines with 2048 characters, the
documentation should be updated. 
I think it would be better to increase the boot protocol version, just
to make it possible that kexec and bootloaders can determine the size
of the command line.  The problem is that if we just increase the
length in kexec, it's not possible to determine if the user wants to
load an old kernel and warn him that the kernel truncates the command
line after 256 characters.

 On the i386 platform, the Linux kernel uses a rather complicated boot
 convention.  This has evolved partially due to historical aspects, as
