Thanks for the insight. I looked more closely at the trace I have and
I see the POSIX timer is adversely affected by the wrap-around of the
jiffies counter.
getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, {it_interval={2147157, 520}, it_value={2146931,
982728}}) = 0
getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, {it_interval={2147157, 520}, it_value={2146931,
962731}}) = 0
getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, {it_interval={2147157, 520}, it_value={2146931,
962731}}) = 0
getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, {it_interval={2147157, 520}, it_value={131, 601993}}) = 0
getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, {it_interval={2147157, 520}, it_value={131, 601993}}) = 0
getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, {it_interval={2147157, 520}, it_value={131, 601993}}) = 0
getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, {it_interval={2147157, 520}, it_value={131, 599993}}) = 0
getitimer(ITIMER_REAL, {it_interval={2147157, 520}, it_value={131, 599993}}) = 0
And when the SIGALRM fires, the app does not handle it.
My next question is, should the POSIX timer be affected like this? I
guess if it uses the jiffies counter, like everything else, it
probably would.
