We covered this in an earlier round of submission, but I should have
updated the inline comments.
While we expose a way for userspace to open an explicit device based on
its knowledge of topology, I think we need a "take your best shot" minor
number, too, which is what this is.
If we *don't* provide one, userspace can end up with exactly the kinds
of messy race situations that used to be seen with ptys before /dev/ptmx
and /dev/pts came along.
