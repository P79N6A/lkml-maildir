Woah, that's new.  And wrong.  The code in include/asm-i386/param.h that
says:
	# define JIFFIES_TO_MSEC(x)     (x)
	# define MSEC_TO_JIFFIES(x)     (x)
Is not correct.  Look at kernel/sched.c for verification of this :)
Looks like we just messed with our carefully tuned scheduler...
We can blame the following changeset from Ingo:
	ChangeSet 1.1608.6.15 2004/05/10 13:26:09 akpm@osdl.org
	  [PATCH] sched: trivial fixes, cleanups
	  From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
	  The trivial fixes.
	  - added recent trivial bits from Nick's and my patches.
	  - hotplug CPU fix
	  - early init cleanup
thanks,
