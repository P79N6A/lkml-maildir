Though external modules using these functions will be hung out to dry. But 
only if you don't select CONFIG_MTD? That's not particularly intuitive.
It's better to mark it deprecated (which has been done), then officially 
remove it (and all in-tree users) once and for all. Compiling the code 
conditionally just to avoid a few warnings is a silly idea.
