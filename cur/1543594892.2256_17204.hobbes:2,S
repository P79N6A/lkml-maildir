Limiting the amount of data being queued for IO will make things less
ragged, but you can't limit the IO.. pages returning to service upon
completion is the only thing keeping you alive.  That's why I hate not
seeing my disk utterly saturated when things get hot and heavy.  The
only thing that I can see that's possible is to let tasks proceed in
an ordered fashion as pages return.. take a number and wait.  IMHO,
right now we try to maintain low latency way too long and end up with
the looping problem because of that.  We need a more controlled latency
roll-down to the full disk speed wall.  We hit it and go splat ;-)

Ingo once mentioned an io thingy for vm, but I got kind of dizzy trying
to figure out exactly how I'd impliment, what with clustering and getting
information to seperate io threads and back ;-)

(not that overhead really matters once you are well and truely iobound)
