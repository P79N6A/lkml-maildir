Much simpler approach:
	if (we're about to read from the disk) {
		if (we have dirty data which is > 10 seconds old) {
			write_it_now();
		}
	}

yup.

Andreas has a patch which puts the device major/minor into kjournald's
process name.
Simply setting the journal timer to infinity happens to work out OK.
Commits are triggered by kupdate.
This is because kupdate's superblock writeout runs a commit.  Because
ext3 is unable to distinguish it from a sys_sync().  Sigh.
