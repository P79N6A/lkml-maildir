I got the bright idea of doing some cmp's on that code module, and 
its identical all the way back to 2.6.7-mm1, (I have them all) but 
differs at 2.6.7:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc1]# cmp fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7-mm7/fs/dcache.c
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc1]# cmp fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7-mm6/fs/dcache.c
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc1]# cmp fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7-mm5/fs/dcache.c
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc1]# cmp fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7-mm4/fs/dcache.c
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc1]# cmp fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7-mm3/fs/dcache.c
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc1]# cmp fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7-mm2/fs/dcache.c
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc1]# cmp fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7-mm1/fs/dcache.c
[root@coyote linux-2.6.8-rc1]# cmp fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7/fs/dcache.c
fs/dcache.c ../linux-2.6.7/fs/dcache.c differ: byte 768, line 33
Or am I barking up the wrong tree?
