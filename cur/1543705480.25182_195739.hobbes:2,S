Hi, every friend:-)
Our custom wanna run their Linux on our machince. But their Linux is Linux
Kernel 2.2.18, and our machine adapt a ultra 320 scsi chip "7902 nohost
scsi chip", we can only find 7902 driver for Linux Kernel 2.4 on Adaptec's
WebSite. So, we can't make a driverdisk contains aic79xx driver for Linux
Kernel
2.2.18 to install customer's old linux on our machince.
I wonder if any one can help me where can I find a aic79xx driver for Linux
Kernel
