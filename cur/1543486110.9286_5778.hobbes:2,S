I've done that too (actually I've used versions of xntpd prior to the 
existence of mlockall()).  If the xntpd gets swapped out during a network
transaction it will complain "previous time adjustment incomplete; residual
0.330151 sec" or some similar number.  Then your time will be off by 1/3
of a second, but that corrects itself soon.  
Don't do this on a peer that acts as a server for other clients, but
feel free to do it on client machines.
