| Btw, this one sounds like a known bug in bash.

|

Suggestion: when the real 2.6.0 comes out, it would be very helpful to
have a document which lists what is needed to upgrade from 2.4 to 2.6
and where to get it. And that the document include information like this
patch you mention, and whatever information is needed to help people
running major distributions.
If the idea is to tell people to read the post-Halowe'en doc and a year
of LKML, it is much the same as telling people to wait for a
distribution. I kept great notes as I built several RH 7.3 and 8.0
machines into 2.6 functionality, and I find that things have moved,
tricks don't work, versions have changed, etc. So a list from the
current Redhat, SuSE, Debian and Slackware at minimum would save people
a lot of problems. Not a major handhold for the clueless, just a list
of issues (emphasis because some people will claim I'm suggesting much
more than I said or meant).

I found that child-run-first broke some code, not that I wrote but
that I certainly maintained without seeing the subtle issues. There will
be people who claim bugs in forked and threaded cooperating processes.
