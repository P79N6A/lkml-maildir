Do you remember our mails from some time before? I advocated using
separate ELF segment with new type. You did not like that approach and
advocated NOTES. Your arguments was, that if going through multiple
notes shows to be a problem, we can always put capability note at the
beggining. 
Now I've asked you to put capability note at the beggining (well, it
was not for performance reasons but for complication-of-code reasons),
and you showed my why that is bad idea.
Well, it probably means (for me) that putting capability info into
NOTE segment is bad idea, and that we should invent our own segment
after all. Are there some real reasons why not invent our own segment?
I feel bad about getting generic note-parsing code into kernel. I
think capability info are quite similar to INTERPRETER segment, and we
should treat them that way. We definitely do not want to go to "what
happens if there are two different capability headers" problem.
