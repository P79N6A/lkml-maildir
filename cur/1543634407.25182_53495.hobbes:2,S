The crash occurs regardless of either of NFS version (v2,v3) or transport (UDP,TCP).

I'm not a kernel hacker (not yet :) ) but looks like VM issue rather than NFS to me.

This surpised me a little but not a lot.
If you are exporting a CDROM, then I assume it is an ISOfs filesystem.
The current ISOfs code doesn't support lookup("..") properly (it
appears to try, but it is all wrong) so if something falls out of
cache, you can loose.
If you aren't already, try exporting with "no_subtree_check".  This
will be more reliable as it doesn't bother with the ".." lookups as
much. 
The reason that it surprised me as little, rather than not-at-all is
that you get an oops, and you getan oops which seems to be miles from
the filesystem or NFS code.  Possibly the current code for ".."
actually corrupts memory and that only hits later.
I have no plans to "fix" ISOfs.  If someone else wants to I can be
more specific about the problem, the requirements, and the approach.
Your VM hack presumably leaves things in cache for longer and so you
don't actually hit the problem.
