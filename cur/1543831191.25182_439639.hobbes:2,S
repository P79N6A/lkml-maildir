Btw, I'm not necessarily one of those people.
There _are_ some things that can be better done in user space, but on the 
other hand, other things really are better off in the kernel.
The argument that user space is more debuggable has been shown to be 
largely a red herring. User space is only more debuggable if it does 
something independent, and we've seen that user space is _harder_ to debug 
than kernel space if we have events going back and forth.
For example, the old pcmcia layer in user space was crap, crap, crap, and 
at least I fount it was MUCH harder to debug than the all-in-kernel code.
