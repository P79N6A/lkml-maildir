Without the preemptive kernel, they are not preemptive.  With
preempt-kernel, they are.  They tend to run at elevated priorities
anyhow, so this is not so much of an issue.

kernel threads can have any scheduling policy or priority - they really
do not differ much from regular threads (sans the lack of address
space).
Some kernel threads do indeed run with real-time policy.
