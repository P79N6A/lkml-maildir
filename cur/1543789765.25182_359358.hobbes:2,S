Hi all,
This patch fixes a long-standing vgacon bug: characters with the bright 
bit set were left on the screen and not blacked out.
All I did was that I lookuped up some examples on the net about setting 
the vga palette, and added the call missing from the linux kernel, but 
included in all other ones. It works for me.
You can test this by writing something with the bright set to the 
console, for example:
  echo -e "\e[1;31mhello there\e[0m"
and then wait for the console to blank itself (by default, after 10 mins 
of inactivity), maybe making it faster using
  setterm -blank 1
so you only have to wait 1 minute.
