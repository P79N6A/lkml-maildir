Hi Pasi,
I have a similar board lying around and I had some trouble getting sound  
to work with OSS/2.4 drivers also. As I remember. the trick was to  
connect the speakers to the microphone port (the pink one, on the far  
left), instead of the regular speaker-out. With ALSA, both on 2.4 or  
2.5/6, the sound output is on the speaker-out port, as it should. One  
small quirk though, as the sound volume is controled by the "Surround"  
mixer setting, rather than "Master" -- this has the most annoying effect  
of making the sound-volume task bar applets useless. Eventually I just  
gave up on the on-board sound and plugged in a pci soundblaster.
Hope this can help you.
Regards,
		Nuno
