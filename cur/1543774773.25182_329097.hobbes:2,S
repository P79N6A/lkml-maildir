I said "traditionally" - it's been a "oh well, we can't do much about it"
problem for a *long* time (for instance, time spent in an interrupt handler
has usually been charged off against whoever's timeslide the interrupt handler
took a chunk out of).  It's only been tolerated so far because (a) the costs
for both users are about equal and (b) you rarely have a heavy I/O DB and a
number cruncher on the same box, or a user doing A/V work and a user doing
programming - if it's not a single-use machine, there's *multiple* number
crunchers, DBs, or programmers, and they tend to balance out.
Said tendency can dissapear quite easily here....

One gotcha here is that it means that you can't do delayed allocation on
writes - you *have* to allocate disk space at each write and then update
the quotas. (And yes, I know that 'man 2 close' says that bad stuff can
happen to your data even after your program exits - that doesn't mean we
should go out of our way to make things worse.. ;)
