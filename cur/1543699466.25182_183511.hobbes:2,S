It should handle that okay (provided you retain a reference to the 
usb_device so that it doesn't get deallocated).  Although it wouldn't hurt 
to change one of the tests from
	if (dev->state != USB_STATE_ADDRESS)
to
	if (dev->state > USB_STATE_ADDRESS)

I agree that it would ease things to provide entry points for set_config 
and reset_device that require the caller to hold dev->serialize already.  
The issue you and Oliver noted about holding the bus semaphore will go 
away when I finally get around to rewriting usb_reset_device().
