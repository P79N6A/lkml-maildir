Perhaps the reason David Miller is the network stack maintainer is that
he can see things that you can't see? The onus is on you (as proposer)
to show _him_ that a change is worthwhile, not the other way round.
Don't be confused into thinking this is some sort of democracy.

Yup. What you've left out is:
4)David has demonstrated that he knows his stuff by high-quality work
  over a long period of time
5)You haven't.
6)Because he is the network maintainer you need to convince him and you
  haven't done so.

Bollocks. Its plainly ridiculous to impugne David Miller and imply his
reputation isn't earned. You or I or your straw automaton could say
"no", but it doesn't mean anyone will listen.
Furthermore, I would propose that the Linux TCP/IP networking stack is "world
class" and has earned David Miller (and others) a fair bit of "reputation
capital", and that's why he (and not you or I) is where he is.

Show why it should be in the main tree and not just a debugging patch.

I think its more like Dave M et al are waiting for someone to show the
slightest bit of evidence to say this isn't better off as just a
debugging patch rather than just waving hands and talking bollocks.
