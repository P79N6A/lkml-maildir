Subject: [patch] Prefetching file_read_actor()

After noticing file_read_actor() showing up in profiles quite
a bit, I grepped old l-k messages, and turned up a post by
Manfred Spraul in which he posted a patch using inline asm
to prefetch read data.  This was x86 specific in generic code,
so was a little hackish..
Now that we have the prefetch macros, I decided to play with
this a little tonight, and came up with this patch..
diff -urN --exclude-from=/home/davej/.exclude linux-2.5.2-pre5/mm/filemap.c linux-2.5/mm/filemap.c

The results are an earth shaking 5 seconds off a make dep bzImage
on my P3, I've not benched an Athlon (or other prefetch aware
architecture) yet, but I expect to see similar speed ups..
Comments ?
