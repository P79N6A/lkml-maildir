MTAs and most other sensible daemons have configuration options for
overriding the host name exactly because the heuristic of "try to use
gethostname() and hope that it is resolvable" does not work in many
cases.
Using the hostname by default is fine if you keep in mind that it is
only a heuristic and that it is not guaranteed to work.
