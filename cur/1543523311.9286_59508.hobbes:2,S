My approach is due to future expandability -- if you ever need ANY
per-chip information besides the init function, then you have to go my
way of setting up the PCI table.  Therefore, why not use my method in
the first place, and make the maintainer's life easier in the long run? 
The extra table is __initdata so the extra couple bytes doesn't even
matter...
