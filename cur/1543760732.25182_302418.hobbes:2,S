Subject: [KBUILD] Bug in make deb-pkg when using seperate source and object directories

Sam,
When running "make O=something deb-pkg", I get a failure that claims I
haven't configured my kernel (I have).  Running it a second time tells
me to run "make mrproper"  (include/linux/version.h got built on the
first run)
I did some preliminary poking around, but kbuild is still, well, mostly
magic to me - I can't see where the object directory is getting lost.
Think you can take a look?  (Note, this failure shouldn't require
anything Debian specific on your system to trigger - it's failing, as
far as I can tell, on the $(MAKE) right before the call build the
builddeb script, so it should be easy to reproduce)
The log of when I run it follows:
ryan@mythryan2 ~/dev/linux/local-quilt$ blocal deb-pkg

"blocal" is a simple wrapper to cut down on retyping things, it's just
this:
ryan@mythryan2 ~/dev/linux/local-quilt$ cat /home/ryan/bin/blocal
#!/bin/bash -e
PWD=`pwd`
if [ "$PWD" != "/home/ryan/dev/linux/local-quilt" ]; then
        cd /home/ryan/dev/linux/local-quilt
fi
make O=../output/local/ -j4 CC="ccache distcc" $*
