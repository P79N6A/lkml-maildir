Subject: ACPI patch submission (was: [PATCH] Implementation of acpi_video_get_next_level)

I've got a patch that fixes acpi_video_get_next_level in the ACPI video
driver.  I sent it to linux-kernel, linux-acpi, and some people at
Intel.  It's a very short and simple patch that fixes the brightness
hotkeys on my laptop, and probably others.  (The function it fixes had
/* Fix me */ written in it.)
Where or how should I send this patch so that it can be included in the
mainline kernel?
Thanks,
Thomas Tuttle
