I don't think "update frequency" is a good abstraction. The hardware's
update may not be variable and irrregular (e.g., event-based), and
there's there's an issue of phase sync to avoid unnecessary latency.
The lazy polling approach I described in my last post to Vojtech
("block until there's  a new readout or N milliseconds have passed,
whichever is later") looks like a more general, accurate and efficient
interface.
