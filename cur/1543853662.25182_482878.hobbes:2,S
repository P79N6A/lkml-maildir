Ok, so we got a useless pglist_data struct and the struct zone contains a 
zonelist that does not include the zone.
numa_node_id() points to this and we always get allocations redirected to 
other nodes. The slab duplicates its per node structures on the fallback 
node.

So we will never encounter that zone except when going to the 
pglist_data struct through numa_node_id()?
