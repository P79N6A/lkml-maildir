If there are thud processes that have earned their place they deserve it, just 
as any other task. If something uses only 1% cpu it is unfair just because it 
only ever sleeps for long sleeps to prevent it getting as good priority as 
anything else that uses only 1% cpu. I've noticed that 'top' suffers this 
fate for example. The problem I've had all along with thud as a test case is 
that while it causes a pause on the system for potentially a few seconds, it 
does this by raising the load transiently to a load of 50 (or whatever you 
set it to). I have no problem with a system having a hiccup when the load is 
50, provided the system eventually recovers and isn't starved forever (which 
it isn't). There are other means to prevent one user having that many running 
tasks if so desired.
