Yes. After checking, I came to this conclusion:
- the only place were we need to have the task_dumpable flag being 0
  is the *child* task which is created by do_fork() as the result
  of calling arch_kernel_thread().
- the parent task, which only requests the creation of a kernel thread
  but itself does not change itself into one with this call does not even
  need to set task_dumpable to 0 for itself, it's just the easyest way
  to set the task_dumpable = 0 copied to the new task:
  Just to show it, in do_fork(), there is this code at the very beginning:
        retval = -ENOMEM;
        p = alloc_task_struct();
        if (!p)
                goto fork_out;
======> *p = *current;
   This allocates a new task_struct for the skeleton of the new task
   and copies the whole task_struct from the parent (*current) to the
   new task_struct (*p), which also copies current->task_dumpable to
   p->task_dumpable.
   So the new task_struct p has task_dumpable set to the same value
   as current had at this time. And as task_dumpable is never changed
   for with another base than current, task_dumpable cannot change
   behind do_fork() is running. So it's 0 here and 0 for p->task_dumpable.
As said, doing task_dumpable = 0 in the parent before the clone() call
in arch_kernel_thread is only the easyest way to set it.
It's not the best way, because in theory, a tracer could try to attach
to the partent while he is executing arch_kernel_thread and before he
has restored task_dumpable to his old value.
During this time window, such tracer would be wrongly rejected from the
call to ptrace_attach() because withing this window, also the parent has
task_dumpable set to 0, not only the child.
The only clean way to fix this remaining side effect is to create a new
clone_flag (say CLONE_KERNEL) which is used by kernel_thread() to tell
do_fork() (or better copy_flags() within do_fork) to set p->task_dumpable
to 0 (only for the child)
I have not done this yet, but to have all cases covered,
it's the most sane way to do it.

Sure, no problem, it's easy and protects against such possible future
brain-dead uses of kernel_thread()... But OTOH, the only place where
this would be sufficent to create an exploit would be kmod, and I hope
nobody who does not know what he is doing will mess with it...
Ok, let's see. If nobody protests against adding CLONE_KERNEL support
to copy_flags() to set p->dumpable to 0, I would prepare a patch with
it.
