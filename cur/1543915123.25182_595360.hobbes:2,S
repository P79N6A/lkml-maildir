Thanks, for the catching this. There are three possible solutions
1. Account each RSS page with a probable swap cache page, double
   the RSS accounting to ensure that swapoff will not fail.
2. Account for the RSS page just once, do not account swap cache
   pages
3. Follow your suggestion and let containers go over their limits
   without error
With the current approach, a container over it's limit will not
be able to call swapoff successfully, is that bad?
We plan to implement per container/per cpuset swap in the future.
Given that, isn't this expected functionality. You are over it's
limit cannot really swapoff a swap device. If we allow pages to
be unused, we could end up with a container that could exceed
it's limit by a significant amount by calling swapoff.
