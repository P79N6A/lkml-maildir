In my case I'm getting read() returning EIO when it tries to read from
the terminal, because the thread pgid doesn't equal the terminal
foreground pgid.  I could solve this problem if either setpgid sets the
pgid in all threads in the thread group, or if I could run setpgid in
all threads for myself (I would prefer the latter just because it is a
bit more flexible).  The current situation is just annoyingly broken
because there's no user-space way to fix it.
