Not idiotic at all, and even if it was, it's still contrary to specific
language in the manpage.
I could *easily* see some program having a line of code:
	if (do_ro_testing) openflags |= O_RDONLY;
I'd not be surprised if J.C. was playing around because a file unexpectedly
shrank to zero size because of code like this.  There's a LOT of programs that
implement some sort of "don't really do it" option, from "/bin/bash -n" to
"cdrecord -dummy".  So you do something like the above to make your
file R/O - and O_TRUNC *STILL* zaps the file, in *direct violation* of
the language in the manpage.
Whoops.  Ouch. Where's the backup tapes?

I hate to think how many programmers are relying on the *documented* behavior to
prevent data loss during debugging/test runs....
