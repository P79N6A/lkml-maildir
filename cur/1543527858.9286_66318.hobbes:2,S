"simple" is a relative term.  And yes, _A_ query can be hostile.

YES.  Do you have explicit permission to be using the computing resources
(albeit next to nothing) of the other network?  I know this sound stupid
and trivial, but it isn't.
If an unknown entity scans your network for unknown purpose(s), it should
be treated just as if some shifty character were wandering through the
parking lot looking in every car. (That's a good way to strike up a
conversation with a cop.)
