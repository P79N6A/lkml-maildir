Hi Oliver,
SIS 655 does also require the delay workaround not to freeze.
Following, the relevant kernel log of my machine (SIS655TX with Radeon 9200):
cdj:~# dmesg |grep -i agp
Linux agpgart interface v0.100 (c) Dave Jones
agpgart: Detected SiS 655 chipset
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 941M
agpgart: AGP aperture is 256M @ 0xe0000000
agpgart: Found an AGP 3.5 compliant device at 0000:00:00.0.
agpgart: Putting AGP V3 device at 0000:00:00.0 into 4x mode
agpgart: SiS delay workaround: giving bridge time to recover.
agpgart: Putting AGP V3 device at 0000:01:00.0 into 4x mode
Cheers,
Cédric Rivard
