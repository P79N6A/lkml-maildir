Problem is that by now we have so much information that valuable
scrolls up. Users start to missing trace dumps in bootup phase because
it just scrolls away too quickly.
I know that "no information" messages can be valuable, but they make
messages with usefull information less likely to be noticed. And
people start doing ugly stuff like
*** This is really
*** important message
when they want their messages to be actually seen. Perhaps we should
reduce ammount of that "no information" messages? I particulary hate
"XXX driver registered" even when that driver has no hardware. Kernel
is quite unlikely to hang at that point.

Does it mean that fbsplash done right would be ok for mainline? ;-).
