Recursive bind traverses the subtree of vfsmnts rooted at the source
mount (following mnt->mnt_mounts, see copy_tree()).  That requires the
source mount's namespace semaphore to be held.

Yes, if you know which mounts they are.

Yes, by taking the source namespace semaphore while traversing the
subtree.  That involves taking _two_ semaphores, so they have to be
ordered to avoid deadlock (see double-locking elsewhere in the kernel).
