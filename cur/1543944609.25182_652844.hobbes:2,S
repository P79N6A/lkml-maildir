the CPU isolation related patches have typically flown through 
sched.git/sched-devel.git, so yes, you can take my "i'd not mind" 
comment as "i'd not mind it at all". That's the tree that all the folks 
who deal with this (such as Paul) are following. So lets go via the 
normal contribution cycle and let this trickle through with all the 
scheduler folks? I'd say 2.6.26 would be a tentative target, if it holds 
up to scrutiny in sched-devel.git (both testing and review wise). And 
because Andrew tracks sched-devel.git it will thus show up in -mm too.
