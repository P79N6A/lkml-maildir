Wrong. Kernel ignores suid bit on scripts. There's no reason it should
honour capability headers.
[Take a look at way how scripts are executed. When script
'script.xyzzy' beggining with 
#!/foo/bar
is executed, kernel executes /foo/bar script.xyzzy. There's a race
here - user can easily delete and replace script.xyzzy in between.]

No it is not. You can still make interpretter suid root, and
interpretter will have to look if script is marked, and in such case
interpretter will have to interpret 'capability headers' in the
script. (You can use your #! idea if you want.) But suid interpretter
will be the one who parses capabilities.
