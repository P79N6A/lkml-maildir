That seems fine, if it will do the job.

This is a stable kernel series; these kinds of userspace-breakage 
changes are not supposed to happen. Personally I have already started 
migrating my systems to udev, but it will take some time to complete 
that. Regardless, this would be a userspace-incompatible change if using 
.devfs_name won't do the job.
