For those that have no intention of staying close to mainline maybe.
The fact is that before a bitkeeper tree (or any other SCM tree) gets
merged with mainline, its subject to change. Sometimes completely dramatic
'throw it all away and start again' changes.  I know this because I've done it,
I know you've done it with pci/usb trees, and various other folks have
done it with their trees.
Pulling whole random subsystem bk snapshots into a vendor tree without
significant review of all contained changesets is the path to madness
unless you're prepared to maintain the resulting mess forever.
