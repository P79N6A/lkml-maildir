Side note, for me the difference on my home directory for the cached vs 
uncached case is 5 seconds vs 5 minutes. I like the 5 sec, I'd like to 
improve on that 5 min.
Is this test a bit *too* simplistic? Probably. But I think that if we can 
come up with an interface that works ok for that test, it at least signals 
*something*.
