Three months after, I have tried kernel 2.6.18 with recent glibc.  I
got desired results for pthread_mutex_unlock and
pthread_cond_broadcast, with PI-mutex.
But pthread_cond_signal and sem_post still wakeup a thread in FIFO
order, as you can guess.
With the plist patch (applied by hand), I can get desired behavior.
Thank you.  But It seems the patch lacks reordering on priority
changes.
Are there any patch or future plan to address remaining wakeup-order
issues?
<off_topic>
BTW, If I tried to create a PI mutex on a kernel without PI futex
support, pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT) returned
0 and pthread_mutex_init() returned ENOTSUP.  This is not a right
behavior according to the manual ...
