Subject: Re: [announce] [patch] Voluntary Kernel Preemption Patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/10/56

Tested on 2.6.7-bk20, Pentium3 700 mhz, 576 mb RAM
I did cp -rf big_folder new_folder . Then opened up a gui ftp client
and music in amarok started to skip like for 2-3 seconds.
Btw Amarok uses Artsd ( KDE Sound Daemon ) which in turn set to use
Jack Alsa Backend.
Cheers,
