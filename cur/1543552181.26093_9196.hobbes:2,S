Really,
It is nice to almost never get reports like this.

This is the first time an error of this type as every been reported to me.
Specifically "status=0x6e".
Was for the other OS like M$, if I reset the bus everytime Linux in
countered an error, I could be as slow and clunky as they are.
Second the drive in question is an OLD!
That drive has been out of warrenty for at least 2 years.
So we are talking about a drive that is possiblely 5 years old that is
spec. to live only 3 years. The final doc rev on that drive that I can get
is 3/24/96 rev E.
