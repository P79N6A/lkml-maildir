What bothers me about the sys_indirect approach is that it will get 
increasingly expensive as time goes on, and in doing so it does a 
user-space memory reference, which are extra expensive.  The extra table 
can be colocated with the main table (a structure, in effect) so they'll 
share the same cache line.
