The patch had no effect.
In fact x86-64 does not set CONFIG_RWSEM_XCHGADD_ALGORITHM so this test
in include/linux/rwsem.h causes asm/rwsem.h to be included which does
not exist on x86-64:
36 #ifdef CONFIG_RWSEM_GENERIC_SPINLOCK
37 # include <linux/rwsem-spinlock.h> /* use a generic implementation */
38 #  ifndef CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT
39 #  define __RWSEM_INITIALIZER __COMPAT_RWSEM_INITIALIZER
40 #  define DECLARE_RWSEM COMPAT_DECLARE_RWSEM
41 # endif
42 #else
43 # include <asm/rwsem.h> /* use an arch-specific implementation */
44 #endif
If I change that code to always include <linux/rwsem-spinlock.h>, I get
the exact same failures I did with 2.6.14-rt22:
$ make
  CHK     include/linux/version.h

etc.
