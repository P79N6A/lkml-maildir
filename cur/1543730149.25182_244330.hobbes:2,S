Well, by updated, I mean fixed.  :)
For 2.4, nightly BK snapshots are being generated once again at
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/snapshots/
For 2.6, I fixed a bug that caused the script to break whenever the 
version number format changes (even from 2.6.8-rc1 to 2.6.8 required 
manual invention).  Nightly BK snapshots are being generated at the 
familiar location,
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/
The snapshot version is always $kversion-bk$snapshot
