It doesn't break in all cases, but quite often, you have
something like:
struct foo {
	__u32 a;
	__u64 b;
};
If you define a
struct compat_foo {
	__u32 a;
	__u64 b;
} __attribute__((packed));
That is broken on all non-x86 architectures, because it removes the
padding that is inserted on the respective 32 bit platforms, while
struct compat_foo {
	__u32 a;
	compat_u64 b;
};
Is a correct definition on all architectures. It also produces
somewhat better code if the architecture does not support unaligned
data access, but that is just an unintended side-effect.
