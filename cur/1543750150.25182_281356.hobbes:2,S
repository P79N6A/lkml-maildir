Hello experts,
  I was building 2.6.9 kernel on my system. When I ran
the 'make install' command it showed the following
error, 
  No module ata_piix found for kernel 2.6.9, aborting.
  mkinitrd failed
  make[1]: *** [install] Error 1
  make: *** [install] Error 2
 I am using pentium4 HT Processor.
 Can anyone help me regarding this?]
Thanks,
selva
