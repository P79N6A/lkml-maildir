Subject: [PATCH] likely cleanup: remove unlikely for kfree(NULL)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

On my system, it shows about 84K misses and 67K hits. So there are more kfree(NULL) than people realize.
I know some people won't like it, but I think it's not worth the confusion and maintenance burden, so I'm giving it a shot. :-)
