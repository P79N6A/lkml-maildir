Let me see if I understand this correctly :)
A technology (MSI) allows one to more efficiently call interrupt 
handlers, with fewer bus reads...  and you want to add a test to each 
interrupt handler -- a test which adds several bus reads to the hot path 
of every MSI driver?
We want to -decrease- the overhead involved with an interrupt, but 
pci_in_msi_mode() increases it.
