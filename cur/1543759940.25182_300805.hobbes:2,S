Just bad timing, I guess. I sent wrong patches, and andrew reacted by
simply waiting for me to catch up with right tree (which is okay, it
was big and not critical).
Now, akpm sent all (?) swsusp updates to Linus, so it should appear in
bk tree later today. If you could regenerate the patches (1/3 will no
longer be needed) and send them to me & l-k. I'll then forward them to
akpm. [He seems to prefer patches to come from my email address :-)]
