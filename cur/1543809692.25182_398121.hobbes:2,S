OK.  The good news is that (my testing shows that) the "sched: fix 
smpnice abnormal nice anomalies" fixes the imbalance problem and the 
consequent CPU hopping.
BUT I still think that this patch (modified if necessary to handle any 
HT special cases) should be applied.  On a normal system, it will (as 
I've already said) stop active_load_balance() from doing a lot of 
unnecessary work INCLUDING holding the run queue locks for TWO run 
queues for no good reason.
