The patch I posted (to deny user access while the device is
transitioning D-states) is to fix a bug where *any* local user can bring
the system into undefined territory, simply by typing lspci at the right
moment.  No special permission is needed.
I hadn't realised that pci_block_user_cfg_access() would call
pci_save_state().  There's only one other user of pci_block_user_cfg_access()
-- drivers/scsi/ipr.c and I think it could be induced to call
pci_save_state() itself.  It's an odd asymmetry anyway -- block calls
save state, but unblock doesn't call restore_state.
