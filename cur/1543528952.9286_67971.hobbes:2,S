My mind was running in circles when I wrote that.  I need more coffee.
Forgive me.
As well, I wasn't aware that you could not define the same CONFIG_
option twice.  I have now been told as much. :)
Since the (suggested) problem has to do with CONFIG_PCI, those
cards which explicitly require PCI can have 'if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" ]'
wrapped around them, and the others can be left as is.
I sent another mail to that effect on the list early this afternoon.
Ack!
