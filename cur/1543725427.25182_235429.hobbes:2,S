The nvidia card seems to work flawlessly even with HW accelleration [i use nvidias evil binary only drivers]. The matrox card OTH disturbs the soundcard severely. Whenever i have activity on my second monitor i get sound artefacts in jack's output [no cracklling, it's rather as if the volume is set to 0 for short moments and then back to normal]. There's a certain chance that this artefact produces an xrun. I suppose it's because the card is on the pci bus.

I also tried putting the soundcard in many different slots to maybe get it on higher prio irq, but it always gets irq 5 [according to /proc/interrupts]..

You could try to adjust the pci latency timer value of your graphic card
and sound card, see this link for a paper on the subject by Daniel
