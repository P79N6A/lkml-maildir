Well, after spending hours scrutinizing Patrick's one-line patch, I'll
guess that, in these cases, the patch does not prevent init from being
killed by an OOM error.  But, I'll bet that was a rhetorical question.
In any event, whatever process has pid == 1, it can't voluntarily exit
without a panic, and it's the reaper of all orphaned children, so it
makes sense not to kill it.  As Eli points out, the patch is cleaner
if rewritten:

since no valid pid is ever negative.
I don't see a valid reason for *not* making this change, but I'm
batting zero for two on my last two patch submissions, so I've
probably missed something.
