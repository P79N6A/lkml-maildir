Oh, the "unpleasant splat" happens with the mmap approach too, there's
no avoiding it. It can happen with a regular "read()" loop too (if the
read happens at the wrong time).
Both mmap and sendfile have the issue that the "splat" can happen every
time, while a read() into a private area means that the splat can only
happen the first time the web server caches the content.  But the read
into a private area is also obviously the worst one from a performance
standpoint. 
There are two ways to avoid the splat:
 - lock the file some way before reading/writing to it.
 - do all updates to a temp-file, and move the temp-file to the new location.
Those two approaches will fix the "splat" problem _regardless_ of what
IO mechanism you use. With that in mind, sendfile() is clearly the one
that performs best by far, so..
