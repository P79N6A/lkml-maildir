Link capture is a normal TCP behaviour unfortunately. You can reduce it a bit
on modem links by lowering the tcp window (man route) and/or the driver
queue length (ifconfig ppp0 txqlen 3 I believe for newer ifconfig).
What actually occurs is that one session starts to drop packets more than the
other, it backs off so the other takes up the rest of the bandwidth, probability
then says the backed off session will tend to fail to get packets through
on retry too
