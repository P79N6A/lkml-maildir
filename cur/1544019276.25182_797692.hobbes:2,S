Davide, I know it's not you who decide. I mean, one patch was proposed
with one arbitrary limit. I've seen it in advance too and I too thought
it would be more than enough. Now people are reporting breakage from
common applications which work in a funny way (I think that using epoll
to poll for one single FD in a multi-process architecture can be called
funny). But those people are not expected to understand the internals,
and most likely their application's behaviour might not be more precisely
described than "it broke since upgrade to 2.6.27.13".
I think we should accept the fact that the fix is causing problems
for people while it was not expected to do so. One of the solutions
would be to increase the arbitrary ratio from 1% to more than that,
but it will still break big setups. Another solution is to accept
that the patch provides a tunable that admins might act on to stop
local users' nasty activities if required, but leave the limit off
by default. And I think that's a saner approach, especially for a
stable series.
