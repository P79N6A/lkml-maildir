Yes.

That should never happen.  The whole idea of destroy_suspended_device()
is that the device couldn't be resumed and in fact should be
unregistered because it is no longer working or no longer present.  A
suspend routine won't detect this sort of thing since it doesn't try to
resume the device.
But it wouldn't hurt to mention in the kerneldoc that 
destroy_suspended_device() is meant to be called only during a system 
resume.
