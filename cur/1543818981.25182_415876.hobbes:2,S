I'm happy about that fact too. So I will not remove that constant then.

Ok, I will break out the x86_64 stuff and resend.

I'm not saying that the kexec code itself should be made simpler, I
just think it is bad to keep unused code left in the source tree. And
regarding the complexity from 0-order allocations - yes - it becomes
more complex to handle single pages but that's what you have to pay
for to avoid fragmentation, right?
My argument against keeping support for N-order allocations is that
someone might feel that it is a good solution to allocate contiguous
pages to workaround something (like x86_64 does) instead of only using
N-order allocations for situations where physically contiguous pages
really are required by hardware.
Non-0-order allocations should be avoided as much as possible IMO.
This is somewhat related to the 4K vs 8K stack discussion, but a much
less frequent allocation problem of course.

Many things can be said about Xen. Maybe they use the keep-it-simple
strategy to begin with. I'm quite sure it will be handled (or at least
will be put on a road map) if it significantly improves performance.

I'm absolutely sure you are right about that. But keeping unused code
in kernel is another question IMO.

Ok, I will avoid modifying the generic framework then.
Thanks for the detailed explanation.
