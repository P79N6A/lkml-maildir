It's the standard nfsd which comes with SuSE 6.0:
===
atlas:/home/baulig > /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd --version
Universal NFS Server 2.2beta38
atlas:/home/baulig > /usr/sbin/rpc.mountd --version
Universal NFS Server 2.2beta38
atlas:/home/baulig > rpm -q --file /usr/sbin/rpc.nfsd
nkita-98.12.14-5
====
I tried to mount the filesystems with the 'nolock' option and it works
fine now.
Thanks for your help!
