That's a defect in the man page, then.
POSIX says on <
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/functions/
 
read.html>:
[...]
DESCRIPTION
The read() function shall attempt to read nbyte bytes from the file
associated with the open file descriptor, fildes, into the buffer pointed
to by buf. The behavior of multiple concurrent reads on the same pipe,
FIFO, or terminal device is unspecified.
[...]
That's a pretty explicit warning exactly where one would expect it.
If Linux read(2) doesn't say something like that, I'll consider that a  
serious bug.

... these days, programmers really *should* know enough to consult a free,  
current, and easily readable version of the relevant standard!

... such as the current case.
