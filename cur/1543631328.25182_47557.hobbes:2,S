   The only major issue I've seen is the build may fail if you run out 
of file handles, or other resources.  The build will fail with an 
"unable to fork" error.  When I was at VA Linux I often compiled kernel 
for use with a make -j 16, or -j 8.  I seem to remember having to play 
with ulimit, and /proc/?/file-max to get enough file handles.
PS- You should also consider logging the output of your compile to a 
file.  As your other jobs will continue for sometime before the make 
fails.  Often preventing you from easily finding the actual compile error.
