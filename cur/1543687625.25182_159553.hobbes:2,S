Well, I don't see any Linus email me about this, but just the same,
sorry about the non-responses.  In the short run, if you resend your
patch, I'll get back to you for real.  In the long run, cramfs (and the
sourceforge tools project) probably could use a new maintainer and it
really should be the same person.
