AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE victims in read_pages() belong in the LRU
Nick Piggin rightly pointed out that the introduction of AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE to
read_pages() was wrong to leave A_T_P victim pages in the page cache but not
put them in the LRU.  Failing to do so hid them from the VM.
A_T_P just means that the aop method unlocked the page rather than performing
IO.  It would be very rare that the page was truncated between the unlock and
testing A_T_P.  So we leave the pages in the LRU for likely reuse soon rather
than backing them back out of the page cache.  We do this by matching the
behaviour before the A_T_P introduction which added pages to the LRU regardless
of what ->readpage() did.
This doesn't include the unrelated cleanup in Nick's initial fix which changed
read_pages() to return void to match its only caller's behaviour of ignoring
errors.
