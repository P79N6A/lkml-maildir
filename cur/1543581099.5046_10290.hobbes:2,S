Does it has to be vectors? What about lists? I'm thinking about this for
some time now and I think lists are more flexible. At higher level we can
easily generate a list of pages and in a lower level you can still split
them up as needed. It would be basically the same structure, but you
could use it everywhere with the same kind of operations.
bye, Roman
