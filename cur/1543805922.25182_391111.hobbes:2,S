Are you sure?  Assuming this change is in effect, consider the
following:
Task starts with default affinity.
Task does sched_getaffinity, stashes the result in saved_mask.
Task pins itself to one cpu and does some work.
Meanwhile, more cpus are brought online.
Task finishes work and does sched_setaffinity(saved_mask).
Task will never run on the new cpus.
