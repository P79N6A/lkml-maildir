Hmmm, this couldn't be the same Keith Owens who claimed that
System.map is too large to be zipped and appended to bzImage could it?
Seriously, don't you find:
  $(NM) vmlinux | grep -v -f scripts/System.map-filter | sort >System.map
just a little bit more readable than:
  $(NM) vmlinux | grep -v '\(compiled\)\|\(\.o$$\)\|\([aU]\)\|\(\.\.ng$$\)\|\(LASH[RL]DI\)' | sort > System.map
More flexible too.
