That has been your own personal experience of such things. Fortunately
by now you've provided to casual readers ample proof that such
experience is but limited and therefore misleading. The fact of the
matter is that *mechanisms* do not "magically" know what detail is
necessary for a given event or how to interpret it: only *markup* does
that.
