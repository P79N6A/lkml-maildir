Actually I'm most interested in ordering "module_init()" and you can have
only one of them per module or how do you want to implement multiple
initcalls per module?

I wouldn't mind if the remaining initcalls are converted to explicit
dependencies, but it's possible to sort automatically everything that can
be built as modules.
