Kernel 2.2.0 destroyed filesystem
I tried to upgrade my kernel from version 2.0.34 to 2.2.0, but this
resulted in destruction of all linux partitions. This has happened
previously on this same machine as I tested development kernels (2.1.126,
2.1.128 and 2.2.0-pre8) using Red Hat 5.0 and Debian hamm. This time I
first upgraded all the software recommended in Documentation/Changes,
although it didn't make any difference in the end.
I've never run into this problem using series 2.0-kernels.
For testing, I compiled the kernel as small as possible, with no modules,
PnP-support or SCSI devices. I only configured it to support ext2- and
iso9660 filesystems. After booting to new kernel it seemed to work fine,
but when I ran 'make menuconfig' to configure a kernel with modules to
work with, the compiler complained about being unable to write to the disk
because filesystem was mounted read-only, and stopped. Login didn't work
any more, perhaps because of user data being destroyed. I then rebooted
the system, which showed many errors about the filesystem being mounted
read-only.
Bootup stopped in kernel panic:

By booting into a kernel on floppy I was able to run fsck, which found so
many errors that I stopped it after ten minutes.
My hardware:
---
AMD K6 233Mhz
Chaintech 5AGM mainboard with VIA VP3 (82C597AT/82C586B) chipset
Seagate ST36531A Medalist 6531 IDE hard disk
---
This is how I partitioned the disk:
---
/dev/hda1 1 Gt FAT32 (win98)
/dev/hda5 1 Gt FAT16 (data)
/dev/hda6 3 Gt ext2  (linux /)
/dev/hda7 64 Mt      (linux swap)
/dev/hda8 1 Gt ext2  (linux /home)

And here is some information suggested in REPORTING-BUGS file.
kernel version from /proc/version (this I used to compile 2.2.0)
---
Linux version 2.0.34 (root@greathan) (gcc version 2.7.2.3)

output of ver_linux script (again, before compilation of 2.2.0)

No modules, no SCSI devices.
I hope this information is useful to solve the problem. Also, I would be
interested to hear if anyone else has had problems of this sort, I haven't
heard of any?
