Yes.

I am using the workaround of carrying the patches in a mail folder, 
applying them in a batch, and not pulling from your tree between 
applying a batch of patches and you pulling from my tree.

After a quick look, stg seems to be an interesting project that might 
suit my needs.
I'd say the main problem is that git with several other projects like 
cogito and stg on top of it allow many different workflows. But finding 
the one that suits one's needs without doing something in a wrong way
is non-trivial.
It might help if someone could write some kind of "Git for dummies" that 
focusses only on the usage and advantages/disadvantages of user 
interfaces like cogito, stg and (H)GCT and restricts the discussion of 
git internals to a short paragraph in the introduction.
