Hi David, hi lists!
(Taking Andrew and Dmitry off private email, this concerns only usb I
guess)

Ok, I turned off hotplug, started it by hand and found what is making
the troubles:
First, it is cups, when trying the backend usb/canon/epson accessing the
usb subsystem. So I turned this of.
Then I tried lsusb, which hang, here is what sysrq-t says:

Does this help you. lsusb is in D+ state.
SOmething similar happened when I tried to remove usbhid, or anything
else related to usb.
Best wishes
