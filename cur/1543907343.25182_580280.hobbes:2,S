You *do* have to worry about it in any box you turn off daily.  Desktop HDs
will croak fast in that scenario, laptop HDs less so, but still too fast.
A very good laptop HD can last about 20k emergency unloads (this is a unit
that can do about 600k normal unloads in its lifetime).  Desktop and server
HDs don't even come close to those numbers, last time I checked.
